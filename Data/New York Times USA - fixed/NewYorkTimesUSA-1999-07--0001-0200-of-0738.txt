HEADLINE: Colombia's Drug Money

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Colombia's decision to include income from illegal drug crops in its official economic figures is yet another step in the creation of the Americas' first narco-state (news article, June 27). Colombian officials claim they must report the value of drug crops so they can provide a clear economic picture to international lending institutions. 
 However, this new step not only legitimates the internal unrest caused by drug lords and narco-guerrillas, but it also ignores that the drug trade does not really "add" to the Colombian economy.
Drug money finances insurgent forces to the tune of almost $100 million a month, damaging the judiciary and the military. The new policy gives the illusion that Colombia is growing when in fact it is being undermined.

HEADLINE: Reports on Economy Signal Solid Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Manufacturing in the Midwest expanded at a faster pace than forecast in June, and the index of leading economic indicators rose in May, suggesting growth could accelerate in the months ahead.
The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said yesterday that its monthly index of regional manufacturing rose to 60.0 in June from 57.9 in May. Analysts expected a reading of 57.3. A reading above 50 means manufacturing is expanding, and a reading below 50 signals a contraction. 
 While the Chicago purchasing managers report measures activity only in the Chicago area, investors watch it because it has often foreshadowed the National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index, which measures conditions nationwide. That report will be released today, and most analysts, who had expected the index to drop to 54.3 from 55.2 in May, revised their forecasts after the Chicago number was reported.
The index of leading economic indicators, which is intended to forecast economic growth the next half year, rose three-tenths of a percent in May after falling one-tenth of a percent in April, the Conference Board reported yesterday. The increase matched analysts' estimates.
May's increase in the index was led by an increase in the money supply, widening interest rate spreads and vendor delivery times, which slow when the economy speeds up. Of the 10 components of the index, 9 made a positive contribution. The only negative contribution, a fall in stock prices, "was insignificant," the report said.
The increase in the index was "consistent with the overall solid growth trend in the U.S. economy," said Ryan Brecht, a market analyst at MMS International. "It's not really going to add or subtract anything to the market's knowledge of the economy. It just repeats what we already know."
The current expansion, now in its ninth year, will become the longest ever six months from now in January.

HEADLINE: Coke Expects Sales to Decline 1% to 2%, Mainly in Europe

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Citing the recall of its soft drinks in Europe last month -- the biggest in company history -- the Coca-Cola Company estimated yesterday that its beverage sales fell 1 percent to 2 percent in the second quarter compared with sales in the period a year earlier.
Sales in the company's European division, which includes Belgium, France and other countries where Coke was ordered off store shelves after a contamination scare, are expected to fall 6 percent to 7 percent, the largest drop in any of Coke's six global divisions. 
 "It's a fairly damaging blow that occurred as a result of the recall," said Skip Carpenter, a beverage analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, adding that before the recall began on June 14, "their Continental Europe business was seeing some good momentum in a lot of markets."
Other markets appeared unimpressive, too. In the United States, typically Coke's star performer, sales are expected to be flat.
"Volume trends for the quarter reflect the difficult global economic conditions that remain in many key markets," the company said in a statement. "In addition, during the month of June, the company has experienced a negative impact on sales in several countries within the Greater Europe Group as a result of the recent temporary product withdrawal in Belgium and France."
Coca-Cola did not say how much the sales drop would affect earnings in the second quarter. Profit was already expected to fall, to 41 cents a share from 47 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings.
Coca-Cola has been mired in a bad year, with profit already down for two consecutive quarters. Starting last August, the company's sales declined in many of its biggest markets around the globe, including Germany, Japan and Brazil, largely because of economic downturns. That slowdown has also affected some of its large bottlers, which have posted gloomy results, too. In the United States, a price increase in many stores has caused sales to drop off.
Efforts by Coke to buy additional brands to expand its overseas business have been stymied by regulators in Europe, Mexico and Australia. In addition, fears that Coke's products were contaminated, which arose when hundreds of people in Belgium complained of nausea, dizziness and other symptoms after drinking Coke and Fanta, led to Government-ordered recalls of an estimated 15 million cases of drinks in Belgium, France and Luxembourg. Three factories in Europe were shut until the bans, which went into effect on June 14 and June 15, were lifted on June 23.
On Tuesday, mold was discovered inside bottles of Bonaqua, a mineral water sold by Coke, and that brand was recalled in Poland.
The volume declines were expected by Wall Street, which reacted positively to the news. Shares of Coca-Cola rose 81.25 cents, to $62, on a day when the rest of the market advanced smartly.
The company said it expected its volume in Latin America to be flat or down 1 percent, compared with 12 percent growth in the second quarter of last year. In Africa, which grew 18 percent in the second quarter of last year on a small base, volume is expected to fall 1 percent to 2 percent, the company said. The company's Asian and Middle Eastern business, which grew 7 percent in the second quarter last year, is expected to decline 1 percent to 2 percent.
M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that "the worst is behind us" and predicted improvement in the second half of the year and next year.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A leading forecaster of ad spending predicts stronger-than-expected gains for this year.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A LEADING forecaster of advertising spending has raised his estimate for 1999 after cutting it earlier because of concerns about the worldwide economic turmoil last fall.
With those qualms virtually vanquished, and amid reports of robust first-quarter ad spending in myriad media, Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at the McCann-Erickson USA unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, is raising his predicted gain for 1999. 
 In December, the last time Mr. Coen offered predictions, "we saw signs the economy was questionable," he said yesterday in a presentation at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan, "and we were cautious."
"But 1999 is turning out to be so much stronger than anybody expected," he added. "We have a lot more stimulus than anyone thought possible six months ago."
For good measure, Mr. Coen also increased for a fourth consecutive time his figures for how much marketers spent to advertise in 1998. And taking his first look at 2000, Mr. Coen was bullish, forecasting that ad spending would be stimulated significantly by elections, the Summer Olympics, millennium hoopla and even advisories about Year 2000 computer problems.
Ad spending is carefully monitored because it is considered a reliable way to assess the condition of the overall economy, particularly the propensity of consumers to spend. Mr. Coen's optimism dovetails with other signs that the economy remains robust, such as the announcement yesterday by the Conference Board that its index of leading economic indicators rose three-tenths of a percent in May after a small decline in April.
"The marketplace looks very strong," said Mr. Coen, whose projections are closely watched because he has been tracking advertising and media trends for five decades for McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, now part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Mr. Coen predicted that marketers would spend a record $213.9 billion this year compared with a revised figure of $201.6 billion for 1998, which represents a 7.5 percent increase from the $187.5 billion spent in 1997.
National ad spending in 1999 is now expected to rise 6.4 percent, to $126.6 billion, compared with Mr. Coen's December estimate of 6 percent. And local ad spending is now expected to grow 5.7 percent, to $87.3 billion, up from his previous forecast of 5 percent.
If Mr. Coen's 1999 forecast is correct, advertising as a percentage of gross domestic product would reach a record 2.39 percent, compared with 2.37 percent in 1998.
In June 1998, when Mr. Coen made his first estimate for 1999 ad spending, he projected an increase of 6 percent. That was trimmed to 5.5 percent in December because of the financial crises in the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, coupled with global stock market swoons. In his presentation, he revised the figure to a gain of 6.1 percent.
While that gain would be the slowest growth since a 5.2 percent increase in 1993, it would still be notable for a "hammock" year between Olympics and elections.
"We're encouraged by the upside revisions," said Karen R. Ficker, managing director for advertising, publishing and new media at Furman Selz in New York, which becomes ING Barings today.
"Everyone's talking about stabilization in Asia-Pacific now, if not improvement," said Ms. Ficker, who attended the Coen presentation.
In revamping his 1999 figures, Mr. Coen cited first-quarter media spending in several important national ad categories, including airlines, computers, drugs and remedies, movies, resorts and tours, restaurants and telecommunications. He also pointed to sharp gains in categories like banks, brokers and mutual funds, cigarettes and liquor.
All that helped increase ad revenue in the first quarter for cable television networks by 28 percent, newspapers by 12.6 percent, magazines by 7.7 percent and yellow pages by 7.1 percent. In the local realm, there were good first-quarter results for media, including radio, up 15 percent; yellow pages, up 5 percent, and newspaper retail ads, up 4.5 percent.
Turning to ad spending overseas, Mr. Coen predicted an improvement, based on the brightening outlooks for countries like Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea and continued growth in countries like Poland.
Spending outside the United States should total $212 billion, he said, up 4.1 percent from a revised figure of $203.7 billion for 1998. That spending last year was a decline of 3 percent from $210 billion in 1997 and was the second consecutive decline after three years of gains.
Mr. Coen's worldwide total estimate for 1999, then, is $425.9 billion, up 5.1 percent from his final figure for 1998 of $405.3 billion, which would be the largest growth since 1995. The spending last year represented a gain of 2 percent from $397.5 billion in 1997, the smallest annual increase since 1993.
Mr. Coen's initial worldwide forecast for 1999, made in June 1998, was $440.5 billion, which was lowered to $435.9 billion in December.
And peering forward for the first time at 2000, Mr. Coen offered a "guesstimate" for snappy growth at home of 7.5 percent, to $230 billion, and respectable growth abroad of 5.7 percent, to $224 billion. The total: $454 billion, up 6.6 percent from 1999.
"I see a lot of similarities between 2000 and 1976," Mr. Coen said, when ad spending in the United States was fueled by Bicentennial campaigns as well as Olympic and election ads.
Another analyst who attended Mr. Coen's presentation, Michael J. Russell Jr., said that he agreed with the 7.5 percent increase predicted domestically for next year.
In addition to Year 2000 factors, said Mr. Russell, advertising analyst in New York for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, Madison Avenue will benefit from such new "brand pipelines" as spending to promote prescription drugs to consumers and Internet advertising.
"Internet I.P.O.'s and business plans say 'Give me money to advertise,' " he added. "There was never a time before when that happened."

HEADLINE: Fed Statement on Rates

 BODY:
Following is the statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term rates: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the Federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent. Last fall the committee reduced interest rates to counter a significant seizing-up of financial markets in the United States. Since then, much of the financial strain has eased, foreign economies have firmed and economic activity in the United States has moved forward at a brisk pace. Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment is judged no longer necessary.
Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures.
Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the F.O.M.C has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action. The committee, nonetheless, recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth.

HEADLINE: After 2 Years, Hong Kong Looks More Like China

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Thursday, July 1

 BODY:
This former British colony passed its second year under Chinese rule today, and to a growing number of critics Hong Kong is taking on a disquieting resemblance to its motherland.
As Hong Kong commemorated the handover, raising the local and national flags and unveiling a Reunification Monument next to its futuristic Convention Center, concern is mounting that it is losing its image as an oasis in freewheeling China, one where the rule of law prevails. 
 Although Hong Kong was supposed to be a semiautonomous region within China for 50 years after the handover -- under the Chinese-British agreement known as "one country, two systems" -- recent events suggest that the one country is rapidly subsuming the two systems.
On June 26, Beijing overruled a Hong Kong court on a landmark immigration case, using a legislative mechanism that deeply troubled legal experts but was requested by the territory's leaders.
A few days earlier, the United States Senate had passed a bill that stipulated that Hong Kong be treated like the rest of China in exporting American technology with military applications. The move was in response to a Congressional report on military espionage and China in which Hong Kong was portrayed as a staging ground for smuggling technology.
"If Hong Kong doesn't constantly bang away at the differences between it and China, the rest of the world is going to start treating them the same," said Michael DeGolyer, director of an academic project that surveys attitudes about Hong Kong's return to China. "If that happens, Hong Kong is dead."
That Hong Kong's autonomy should be threatened is no surprise, said academic experts, lawyers and democracy advocates. Before the handover, many people had predicted that no treaty between Britain and China would be a match for the ineluctable march of Chinese sovereignty.
But in the first year after the change, worries that China would meddle were obscured by the Asian financial crisis, which plunged this prosperous enclave into its worst recession since World War II.
China largely stayed out of Hong Kong affairs, leaving the local government to battle rising unemployment, a swooning stock market and currency speculators. Now, though, as the economy begins to recover, worries about Hong Kong's rule of law and autonomy are resurgent.
The reversal by Beijing of the Court of Final Appeal here was its first overt interference in the Hong Kong legal system. The Chinese Government was acting at the behest of the local authorities, who feared that the ruling would open the door to more than one million immigrants from mainland China. But critics said the decision could a set a precedent for Beijing to overturn any unpopular ruling.
"The rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's success," a democracy advocate, Emily Lau, said. "If we don't have the rule of law, then we're just another Chinese city."
On Wednesday, lawyers protested the reversal in a silent march.
The chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, Ronny Tong, said, using a British phrase for a singular case: "I'm an optimist, and I would like to think this is a one-off situation. But the Government keeps giving out mixed signals."
The Hong Kong Justice Secretary, Elsie Leung, has refused to rule out asking Beijing to intervene in future court rulings.
But the No. 2 official, Anson Chan, said on Wednesday that Beijing's action "was an exceptional decision made in exceptional circumstances." Mrs. Chan, who had just returned from a trip to the United States and Canada, said officials there had expressed doubts about Hong Kong. Among the skeptics was Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California, who led the committee that investigated accusations that China had acquired military secrets from the United States.
In a meeting with Mrs. Chan, Mr. Cox said he was concerned that China could divert technology from Hong Kong by smuggling it across the border on trucks that belonged to the Chinese Army, which has maintained a garrison in Hong Kong since the change in government.
Mrs. Chan said Mr. Cox had accepted her invitation to visit Hong Kong to inspect its customs procedures. But she conceded that he was not alone in harboring doubts about the separation between Hong Kong and China.
Hong Kong has not been helped by a recent Chinese Government decision to bar United States military planes from landing here. That extends a ban imposed on American warships. Experts said China was sending a chilly message in the aftermath of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
Although China is entitled to take such action, analysts said it simply reinforces the perception that Hong Kong -- two years later -- is in danger of becoming an afterthought rather than an exception.

China in No Hurry to Reopen Talks on Joining Trade Group

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 30

 BODY:
In public statements and private signals, China has indicated that it will not resume talks with the United States any time soon over its proposed entry into the World Trade Organization.
"The talks are certainly moribund," said the departing American Ambassador, James Sasser, in an interview in Beijing today, his last day on the job. 
 "But I wouldn't say it's reached the stage of a total cadaver," said Mr. Sasser, who has met in recent days with the top Chinese leaders, and predicted that relations would improve this fall. At an Asia-Pacific economic meeting this week in New Zealand, the deputy United States trade representative, Richard Fisher, said the United States was ready to restart the talks and that "the ball's in China's court."
But a top Chinese trade official at the same meeting, Long Yongtu, responded today that China would not enter negotiations until it received a "convincing explanation" for the deadly bombing in May of its Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
Earlier in June, a senior American diplomat came to Beijing to offer a detailed description of what went wrong in the air attack, which killed three Chinese. But China rejected the explanation as implausible.
So the condition laid out by Mr. Long seems to have put the trade negotiations on ice for now -- even though the Chinese have said for years that rapid entry into the world body, which sets rules for trade and market access, was a priority.
The two countries have not held talks on China's entry into the trade organization since April, when Prime Minister Zhu Rongji visited Washington and offered many of the market-opening measures demanded by the West. Fearing Congressional opposition, President Clinton did not conclude a deal at the time.
Talks had been expected to resume within weeks, and both sides had said they hoped to reach agreement this year. Then the embassy bombing chilled relations. But China said it wanted to continue normal economic ties, and the Americans have waited ever since for an invitation to resume discussions.
Mr. Zhu, an advocate of entry into the World Trade Organization, has been subjected to growing criticism by ministries and industries that feel they would be harmed by a rapid opening of markets.
For status as well as economics, China has for years said it wanted to enter the trade group, and charged that Western countries were imposing unduly strict conditions for entry.
Today, Mr. Long reiterated China's intention to join. But his political condition for talks, along with other recent signals here, suggests that the Chinese Government may be more divided than in the past over rapid entry -- perhaps even preferring to put off talks while blaming American intransigence.
"I think they've decided it's no big deal for them right now," Mr. Sasser said today.
Mr. Sasser, a former Democratic Senator from Tennessee, is moving to Washington, where, he said, he hopes he can help the Presidential bid of his old friend Al Gore. President Clinton has selected retired Admiral Joseph W. Prueher, former Commander of Pacific Forces, as the next Ambassador, but his nomination is subject to Senate confirmation.

HEADLINE: The Fed Makes a Minimal Move

 BODY:
William McChesney Martin Jr., the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board during the great economic expansion of the 1950's and 1960's, once said that the role of the Fed was "to take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going."
Alan Greenspan, the current Fed chairman, yesterday served notice that he does not want to spoil the fun. While the Fed did raise an important interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, as had been widely expected, it also said its policy was now neutral, rather than biased in favor of a further increase. Wall Street celebrated by sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 200 points in the first 15 minutes after the Fed announcement. Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues seem to be betting that the economy will cool down without much action by the central bank. 
 The Fed has been expecting the American economy to slow for the past three years, but the willingness of consumers to spend rather than save has kept the economy roaring ahead. Now, with the manufacturing sector strengthening as overseas economies rebound, signs of inflation have appeared, as Mr. Greenspan noted in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee two weeks ago.
The bond market had expected the Fed to take stronger action yesterday -- or at least not signal that it would probably forgo another rate increase -- and the yield on long-term government bonds slipped below 6 percent after the announcement. But that rate is up from 4.8 percent late last year, a fact that has pushed mortgage interest rates up and slightly slowed the strong housing market.
Even with rates rising, however, consumer confidence has climbed to a 30-year high. That suggests that neither the economy nor consumer spending is likely to slow soon. If the American economy continues to grow at the recent rate of above 4 percent, there are substantial risks that inflation will accelerate and that, with the record trade deficit continuing to expand, the dollar will eventually come under heavy pressure.
Those risks will be intensified if the White House and Congress choose to ease fiscal policy now, either through large new spending programs or by a big tax decrease. Should that happen, Mr. Greenspan may have no choice but to push interest rates up again later this year.

HEADLINE: Banks Raise Prime Rates

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Bank of America Corporation, the biggest United States bank; the No. 2 Chase Manhattan Corporation; the Bank One Corporation, and Keycorp raised their prime rates to 8 percent from 7.75 percent yesterday after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time since March 1997.
Other banks are expected to do the same. The Fed raised the target overnight-bank lending rate by a quarter point, to 5 percent. to slow inflation by damping economic growth. 
 The prime rate, traditionally the rate at which banks lend money to their best customers, is a benchmark interest rate for bank loans to consumers. The rate increases announced by banks yesterday are effective today.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Late-Season Spurt Helps Shares in Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Statistically, the spring quarter was another banner period for stocks, as the main gauges all climbed between 5 and 12 percent, shattering records along the way.
But the gains, capped by yesterday's surge after the Federal Reserve chose the mildest of expected options on monetary policy, raising rates a quarter of a percentage point, masked unusual market turmoil. 
 The Nasdaq market, where high-technology issues dominate, tumbled below its March 31 level each of the three months in the second quarter before ending at a new peak.
Its gyrations included gut-wrenching declines in many of the most prominent Internet stocks and coincided with a steady rise in interest rates that pushed yields up one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point across the board.
But while many of these onetime highfliers remained far below their peaks -- Amazon.com, for example, skidded to $125.125 from $172.1875 -- the Nasdaq market as a whole finished the quarter ahead 9.1 percent, with more than half of this gain in the final three days.
"The main theme was the rebound in technology," said Robert J. Froehlich, vice chairman of Kemper Funds, noting that stocks trading at high multiples of annual earnings are particularly vulnerable to rising interest rates. "That should be bad news for tech, but these things rallied right in the face of it."
Earlier in the quarter, however, rising rates took a heavy toll on both established growth stocks and more speculative ones, as many investors shifted money into stocks of companies tied to the economic cycle. Their reasoning was that the economy was growing so fast that these laggards might finally get some leverage to raise product prices.
"There was this turbocharged rotation out of the high price-earnings growth stocks and into the lagging cyclicals," said Charles J. Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S. G. Cowen Securities.
Pfizer, for example, skidded from a high of $150.125 in mid-April, to $95.125 in mid-June, while Alcoa rallied from a low of $40.75 in early April, to as high as $67.9375 in mid-June. The differential between the drug company's percentage loss and the aluminum company's percentage gain was more than 100 percent, a stunning gap that Mr. Pradilla said was no doubt far greater than any plausible change in economic conditions. By the end of the quarter Pfizer was up to $109 and Alcoa down to $61.875.
Indeed, as the quarter ended many cyclicals were fading, perhaps having benefited more from a lack of other places to put money that had come out of growth stocks than from a conviction that pricing-power inflation might be on its way. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which is skewed toward big growth companies, finished the quarter with a 6.7 percent gain, surpassing its 4.6 percent first-quarter gain. This means that if the second half of the year is as good as the first half, this index, so widely used as a benchmark, will once again confound forecasters and advance more than 20 percent for a fifth straight year.
The Dow Jones industrial average posted the best performance of the three major gauges, rising 12.1 percent but failing by the narrowest of margins, one-tenth of 1 percent, to regain enough ground to end the quarter above its record, 11,107.19 set on May 13.
Significant amounts of the money that was switched into cyclicals in the quarter went into smaller-company shares, with some value-oriented portfolio managers declaring that this long-neglected sector might finally be getting its due. Indeed, the Russell 2000, the most widely cited index for this group, gained a hefty 15.1 percent in the quarter.
But there was a growing view as the quarter ended that the Federal Reserve would one way or another make sure that the economy's 4 percent growth rate was throttled back. A slowing economy is a poor climate for small companies.
Besides the Internet casualties in the quarter -- America Online, for example, ended 35 percent lower than its April 6 peak of $175.50 -- the drug group took a heavy hit.
McKesson-HBOC slumped 52.3 percent; Pfizer, 24.4 percent; Amgen, 20 percent; Eli Lilly, 19.9 percent, and Merck, 10.8 percent as talks heated on proposals that could involve Federal price controls on prescriptions.
The top winners in the S.& P. 500 had the following gains in the quarter: National Semiconductor, 168.5 percent; Nalco Chemical, 94.8 percent; Case, 92.1 percent; Millipore, 62.7 percent; Raychem, 60.7 percent, and Cummins Engine, 60.5 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
As Rates Rose, Underwriting Dipped in the Second Quarter

BYLINE: By SHOLNN FREEMAN 

 BODY:
Wall Street's core business -- the underwriting of stocks and bonds -- slowed slightly in the second quarter as market interest rates rose.
Securities firms and banks issued $553.1 billion of bonds and stocks, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data, a drop of nearly 11 percent from $620 billion in the second quarter of 1998. It was also down 9 percent from the first quarter of this year. The firms' performances were particulary weak in June, at $157 billion in new issues, the smallest monthly total so far this year. 
 Uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates knocked a chunk out of the debt business. Over all, the volume of corporate debt issued fell 11 percent, to $495.3 billion, in the quarter from a year earlier. The amount of new high-yield securities, the low-rated issues sometimes referred to as junk, fell 42 percent.
For the first half of the year, only Merrill Lynch & Company and Salomon Smith Barney had more than $100 billion in debt underwriting volume, while four firms did so last year. Morgan Stanley's debt underwriting fell 28 percent from a year ago, while that of Goldman, Sachs dropped by about 32 percent in the first half.
The much-anticipated decision yesterday by the Federal Reserve to raise a key short-term interest rate by one-quarter of a percentage point could have helped clear the air.
"Investors became cautious as interest rate fears took over the market, especially by the last month of the second quarter," said Ernesto Cruz, head of equity capital markets at Credit Suisse First Boston. "With the completion of the Fed's action we might see some stability in interest rates and recovery in new issues."
Merrill Lynch continued to lead securities firms in total underwriting volume. In the second quarter of the year the firm handled about 14 percent of the stock and bond volume. Salomon Smith Barney placed second, followed by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Goldman, Sachs. Credit Suisse First Boston knocked off Lehman Brothers to finish in the top five.
The quarterly rankings of securities firms, known as league tables, are closely watched within the industry as an indicator of which banks and brokerage houses are strongest. Goldman, Sachs led Merrill Lynch by one key measure, underwriting fees, in large part because of its lucrative business with hot Internet stocks. In the first half of the year, Goldman, Sachs saw a 22 percent gain in fees to $900 million. The other top firms reported sharp declines in fees. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, which finished second and third respectively, saw fees drop by more than 25 percent in the first six months of the year.
In the coveted role of underwriting initial public offerings of stock, Goldman dominated in the most recent quarter. It underwrote $5.6 billion worth of new issues for 35 percent of the total market. Goldman brought public Etoys and TheStreet.com, among others. But its biggest issue was the $3.7 billion public offering of Goldman itself. Without its own issue, Goldman would have edged out Morgan Stanley, which handled $1.8 billion in initial stock offerings, by just $200 million in the latest quarter. Morgan Stanley had about a 12 percent market share.
Goldman came close to doubling its market share in the much bigger field of underwriting stock offerings by companies that are already public. In all, the industry underwrote $56 billion in the latest quarter, $3 billion less than a year earlier, in what are called secondary equity offerings. After Goldman came Morgan Stanley, which took second place away from Merrill Lynch. Salomon Smith Barney and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette completed the top five.
Merger and acquisition activity fell by 19 percent, to $552 billion in the second quarter, from $681 billion a year ago, based on the value of the announced deals. Goldman won the race, but lost market share, barely edging out Merrill Lynch. Goldman handled $193 billion in United States deals, for a 34.9 percent share, besting Merrill by a tenth of one percent.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE UNITED NATIONS;
Annan Urges Swift Action On Assistance To Kosovo

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 30

 BODY:
Warned today that urgent action was needed to reintegrate refugees flooding back into Kosovo, United Nations members were cajoled or shamed into pledging additional money and personnel to help secure and assist a democratic, multiethnic Kosovo.
By the end of the conference, organized by Secretary General Kofi Annan, 18 self-declared "Friends of Kosovo" had almost doubled their contributions to what will be an armed international police force in the Serbian province -- increasing the promised forces from 1,000 to 1,938. That, however, is still about 1,000 short of the 3,110 police officers that the United Nations estimates are needed to stop revenge killings and looting and to restore order. 
 At the same time, members of the United Nations failed to agree on the nature and scope of assistance for Yugoslavia as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains President.
Pledges of additional support came from the foreign ministers and other senior officials who attended the conference, the first review of international relief and rehabilitation efforts since June 10, when the Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the United Nations to run a civilian administration in Kosovo alongside the NATO-led military force. While that force is supposed to have 50,000 troops, less than half have been deployed.
Mr. Annan organized the conference largely to encourage donors to increase their contributions. "These are pledges, and we cannot deploy and distribute what we do not have," Mr. Annan told the conference.
Mr. Annan was unable today to name the United Nations chief representative to Kosovo. According to senior United Nations officials, he had planned to appoint Martti Ahtisaari, the Finnish President, but Mr. Ahtisaari was said to have withdrawn after France demanded that he resign as President in order to devote himself full time to the post.
France has its own candidate: Bernard Kouchner, its Health Minister, whom Mr. Annan named today as one of four candidates he is considering. The others are Paddy Ashdown, Britain's retiring Liberal Party leader; Emma Bonino, an Italian who heads the European Commission for Humanitarian Affairs, and Jan Pronk, the Dutch Housing and Environmental Minister.
Several foreign ministers and senior diplomats at the four-hour, closed-door conference praised the United Nations effort on the ground, especially the performance of Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations Undersecretary General whom Mr. Annan assigned as temporary chief representative until the post is filled.
While some diplomats had urged Mr. Annan to give the post to Mr. de Mello, a Brazilian, the Europeans, who are financing most of the Balkans reconstruction, insist that a European get the job.
At a news conference after the meeting, Mr. Annan said the ministers had disagreed over what constituted "humanitarian" assistance and whether Serbia should receive it.
A senior Administration official said that Japan and Britain, the Netherlands and other Europeans wanted to insure that Belgrade got no reconstruction or other assistance as long as its leader is Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicted on war-crimes charges. But Russia and China pushed for a broad definition, insisting that because Kosovo is part of the former republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia should get aid.
"Some ministers sounded more like 'friends of Serbia' than "friends of Kosovo," a senior American official said.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright reiterated Washington's stance that Serbia should receive no help that would "bolster the position of the current regime in Belgrade."
But Mr. Annan said that unless Serbia received minimum assistance -- such as money to rebuild bridges over the Danube, and electrical and water plants that NATO jets destroyed -- neither Kosovo nor the Balkans would recover. "It is pointless to take in loads and loads of medicine if people are taking in dirty water and then get sick," he said.
Privately, the Americans have said they would not oppose aid to, say, dredge the Danube of debris, since such obstacles block navigation that is critical to the economic recovery of Belgrade's neighbors. But they oppose aid that might benefit Mr. Milosevic.
Ms. Albright said today that the United States would send 550 American police officers and trainers to Kosovo.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stockand Bond Markets Both Like What They Hear From the Fed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock and bond markets both rallied yesterday after investors got a surprise they liked from the Federal Reserve Board. The central bank signaled that a quarter percentage point increase in its short-term interest rate target could be enough to keep inflation in check.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 210 points within 13 minutes after the Fed's announcement at 2:15 P.M. and finished the day at 10,970.80, up 155.45 points, or 1.44 percent. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 21.26 points, or 1.57 percent, to a new high of 1,372.71. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 44.01 points, or 1.67 percent, to a new high of 2,686.12. The S.&.P.'s previous high was in May and the Nasdaq's in late April, both just before the Fed indicated, after its May policy meeting, that a rate increase was in the offing.
In the bond market, the price of the 30-year bond jumped 1 9/32, to 90 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.96 percent, from 6.06 percent on Tuesday. The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed interest rate moves, dropped to 5.52 percent from 5.68 percent.
The Fed announcement had a calming effect on the more vulnerable emerging markets, especially in Latin America. The Bovespa index in Brazil jumped more than 300 points after the news, to close up 2.2 percent. More important, interest rates on emerging-market bonds dropped sharply in comparison with rates on United States Treasury securities.
Fed policy makers, meeting in Washington, announced that they had raised their target for the Federal funds rate, which is the interest on overnight loans between banks, to 5 percent from 4.75 percent. That move was expected and led several major banks to raise their prime lending rates a quarter-point, to 8 percent.
At the same time, the Fed surprised investors by shifting its interest rate outlook. Rather than leaning toward higher interest rates, as they were going into yesterday's meeting, policy makers are now neutral.
But some analysts argued that the Fed's shift did not mean there would not be another rate increase. That will depend on how fast the economy continues to grow and how tame inflation remains.
The Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index in June rose to its highest level in more than 30 years, a fact that could keep consumers spending. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago reported that its factory index had jumped again in June, showing a growing manufacturing revival in the Chicago region.
A recent rally in copper prices, which reached a 1999 high of 75.95 cents a pound yesterday, could reflect a worldwide economic rebound and put upward pressure on inflation. Also yesterday, the price of oil for August delivery broke out of an eight-week trading range, rising to a 1999 high of $19.29 a barrel.
More indications on economic growth will come today, with the release by National Association of Purchasing Management of its manufacturing index for the entire nation, and on Friday with the employment data for June.
In addition, the rally in market interest rates since last week could keep key rates -- like those for mortgages -- from rising much more, a fact that would make a significant slowdown in growth less likely. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note yesterday was 5.78 percent, a quarter-point below its recent high and less than a quarter-point above where it was when the Fed gave its May signal of an interest rate increase.
"I think a little bit of this celebration is unwarranted," said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
Neil M. Soss, chief United States economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, thinks another rate increase is likely in August, although the odds have diminished. But he said that "from the market's point of view, this is pretty much an all-clear." That, he said, is because the news yesterday reassured investors that the Fed, at worst, would push interest rates only modestly higher.
The Dow, which was down as much as 83 points early in the day, was led higher by J. P. Morgan, I.B.M. and General Electric, all three of which rallied after the Fed announcement. The Nasdaq, which was down 21 points, was powered by Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Yahoo.
The Fed decision also appeared to help stocks of smaller companies, which were undervalued after years of lackluster performance but have rallied sharply since March as investors moved from growth stocks. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller company stocks rose 3.6 points, to a 1999 high of 457.68. Since March 23, the Russell index is up 19.4 percent, matching the Dow's performance for the entire year. But the index is still below its high of 491.41 in April 1998.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Clinton Says He's Not Slowing Down

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 30

 BODY:
Two days ago, a local politician introducing President Clinton at a fund-raising luncheon in Westport, Conn., said Mr. Clinton was entitled to a "victory lap" of public valedictories as he completed his final 18 months in office.
Mr. Clinton bristled at his host's well-meaning remarks. 
 "I don't feel I'm on a victory lap or a final lap," Mr. Clinton told the crowd of contributors, a smile disguising his impatience with those ready to write him off. "They're beginning to talk to me as if I'm -- there is a sort of ring of eulogy about all of this. As far as I can tell, I'm reasonably healthy. I still show up."
Say this about Bill Clinton: He will not go gentle into political oblivion.
In the past six days, he has given a major domestic policy speech laying out his priorities for the next year, conducted a 75-minute endurance test of a news conference and announced that his budget team had found an additional trillion dollars in Federal surpluses over the next 15 years.
He also unveiled the most sweeping set of proposals for remaking Medicare in the program's 34-year history, which he pitched to senior citizens here today.
Mr. Clinton has called on Republicans in Congress to set aside partisanship and embark with him on a "season of progress" on Medicare and Social Security, education, gun control, health care and campaign financing.
Mr. Clinton said the public was pleading for at least a temporary truce in the partisan bickering and rancor that have characterized his six and a half years in office.
Never mind that Mr. Clinton and the Democrats are at least as responsible as the Republicans for the capital's polarization. Mr. Clinton now wants progress on his agenda -- and his legacy -- and says he is willing to compromise on taxes in order to get it.
He swears that he is serious about wanting to get things done before Presidential politics and Congressional campaigns swallow Washington's energy. Responding to Republicans who doubt his sincerity -- and even some in his own party who would prefer to run their campaigns against a do-nothing Republican Congress -- Mr. Clinton said there was a narrow window for bipartisan agreement on critical national issues.
On Friday, Mr. Clinton told a group of students at Georgetown University: "Now, some other people here really believe that because the Presidential season has already started, the battle for Congress has already started, even though it's a year and however many months away, that the best politics is just to run out the clock and wait until the next election and hope that the country is doing so well and we enjoy the lazy days of summer so much, nobody will notice. I don't agree with that, either."
Mr. Clinton's speech at the White House on Tuesday detailing his Medicare proposal was similarly suffused with the spirit of sweet reason. He hailed the participation of several Republican leaders, saying: "Their presence here today indicates that we can all raise concerns about each other's ideas without raising our voices. It augurs well for this announcement today and for the welfare of our Republic."
But inside that velvet glove of accommodation was the President's mailed fist of partisan aggression. Mr. Clinton said the nation's leaders had not only an opportunity but also an "obligation" to remodel Medicare for the onslaught of the baby boom generation early in the next century.
The clear message is that if Mr. Clinton's health-care plan is rejected or weakened, it will be the fault of the parsimonious Republicans who prefer to give the nation's economic bounty to the wealthy, in the form of cuts in capitals gains and estate taxes, rather than to the deserving elderly.
Mr. Clinton's health and education plans follow a familiar pattern: he proposes generous new programs that poll well with the public and challenges Republicans to act on them.
So, too, with Medicare. Polls show that a subsidized prescription drug benefit is extremely popular with the public and the new budget surplus projections afford Mr. Clinton the luxury of proposing it.
Mr. Clinton was warmly received here today when he pitched his Medicare proposal to an audience of several hundred older people at the Chicago Cultural Center.
One member of the audience, Frances Krause, 79, of Chicago, expressed hope that the President could persuade Congress to pass his Medicare proposal, or at least the prescription drug part of it. But Mrs. Krause, a registered Republican who often splits her votes between the two parties, said Republicans might try to block the plan to prevent Mr. Clinton from getting credit for it.
"Whatever he's for, they're against," she said.

HEADLINE: Housing and Medicaid Laws Lapse as Budget Talks Hit Wall

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 30

 BODY:
State budget talks collapsed today, as New York reached the unfortunate milestone of going three months without a budget, and lawmakers failed to extend laws that protect loft tenants, lower New York City property taxes and trim Medicaid costs.
"The budget process in this state is continuing to fail," said Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader. Recalling that in 1997 New York's budget was passed on Aug. 4, 126 days late, a modern record for any state, he added, "What I see is probably us setting another record for a late budget." 
 Mr. Bruno and the Democratic Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, said they were very close to agreement this week on the outlines of a $73.8 billion budget that would have allowed the two houses to convene conference committees to work out the final details. But Gov. George E. Pataki stepped in today and, Mr. Silver said, "indicated very strongly that he would not approve where we were."
While the leaders said they would continue to meet, no sessions are scheduled. Members of both houses have been sent home until July 12, though they could be summoned sooner. The budget, which was supposed to be in place by the April 1 start of the fiscal year, will be 92 days overdue on Thursday, the third-latest in state history.
The main sticking point, the three leaders said, was Medicaid spending. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, insists on keeping the Medicaid cuts that were enacted in 1995 and 1996, and has called for new cuts worth about $800 million a year. Both houses of the Legislature have rejected the new cuts, and the Assembly Democrats want to reverse some of the old ones.
At midnight tonight, some of the 1995 and 1996 cuts will lapse, forcing state and local governments to shoulder higher hospital and nursing home costs for at least three months. That will cost the state $82 million, and New York City and counties around the state $50 million, for the quarter, and local officials have heavily lobbied state lawmakers not to let the measures lapse.
Also at midnight, the law governing about 4,000 loft units, nearly all of them in Manhattan, will expire, and those lofts will effectively become illegal dwellings, theoretically exposing their residents to eviction. At the same time, a $166 million-a-year tax break for co-op and condominium owners in New York City will also lapse.
However, lawmakers predict that both problems will be fixed retroactively without any damage done, though the standoff has unnerved thousands of city residents.
Tonight's deadlines were seen by officials in both parties as factors that could prod painfully slow budget talks, because Mr. Silver wanted to extend the loft law, the Governor wanted to preserve the existing Medicaid cuts, and both men favored keeping the city tax break. Instead, the looming expirations produced a stare-down between the Governor and the Speaker, whose caustic relationship has reached new lows this year. In the end, neither man blinked.
As it became clear today that the deadlines would pass without any action, the leaders called news conferences to take shots at each other. Mr. Pataki accused Mr. Silver of trying "to give all things to all people," trying to spend so much that it would create a fiscal crisis, and then talking "about creating jobs and improving the economy."
He added, "I think it's tragic that Speaker Silver and the leadership of the Democratic Assembly refuse to pass a continuation of the Medicaid cost containment."
The Speaker, in turn, said of the Governor, "The lack of leadership has set us back." He noted that at a time when the state has a $2 billion surplus, Mr. Pataki has proposed trimming Medicaid, reducing aid to poor college students and backing away from the state's 1997 commitment to pay for prekindergarten classes. "We will not balance the budget on the backs of those 4-year-olds," Mr. Silver said.
When asked who was to blame for the latest breakdown, Mr. Bruno sighed and said, "When the system is as dysfunctional as ours is, it's hard to point a finger as to who's at fault."
Still, in intensive talks over the last three weeks, the three leaders have made considerable progress toward a budget, with Mr. Silver greatly reducing his spending demands, and Mr. Pataki agreeing to spend significantly more than outlined in his January proposal. Lawmakers in both parties say they are near agreement on a proposal very much like the Senate Republicans', for a $73.8 billion budget, $1.1 billion above the Governor's.
Just as important, the Governor pledged that if the overall numbers were in that range, he would not veto broad portions of the budget, as he did last year. But he did not include Medicaid in that promise.
Most state officials believe that in the end, the 1995 and 1996 cuts will be restored, and the proposed new cuts will not take effect, but reaching that point has proved difficult. Local government officials are blaming Mr. Silver for raising their costs, because the Senate voted to renew the old cuts, while Mr. Pataki is under attack from the hospital workers' union for his proposed cuts.
Mr. Silver said today that the local governments will not really lose $50 million through the expiration of the Medicaid cuts. Some of the higher payments, he said, will go to city- and county-owned hospitals and nursing homes, and will trigger higher Federal matching payments.
Lawmakers in both parties predict that the loft law and the co-op and condominium tax break will be extended, and that in any case, it would take weeks or months for a landlord to evict someone.

HEADLINE: FED RAISES A RATE, BUT THEN SUGGESTS THAT MAY SUFFICE

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve nudged its benchmark interest rate up by a quarter of a percentage point today but said there was no clear case for another rate increase to keep inflation at bay.
The increase in the overnight lending rate between banks, known as the Federal funds target rate, had been expected by economists and investors for weeks. The rise, to 5 percent from 4.75 percent, came after a series of three quarter-point rate reductions made by the central bank last fall during the height of the global financial crisis. 
 But many analysts had expected the Federal Reserve to raise rates by another quarter-point at its next meeting in August, and they were caught off guard by the central bank's suggestion today that there was no consensus on the need for another increase to slow the economy's growth.
That suggestion, in the form of a shift to a neutral stance from a stance toward higher rates, was taken as a green light by investors on Wall Street, who rapidly bid up stock and bond prices in the belief that higher rates were less likely this summer.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 210 points in the 13 minutes after the central bank's announcement and finished up 155.45 points, to 10,970.80. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell below 6 percent, closing at 5.96 percent. Page C1.
Economists warned that investors might have overreacted and said that the Fed had not ruled out the possibility of another rate increase as soon as August if the economy did not show clear signs of cooling. In fact, a continued rise in stock prices could offset the slowing effect of today's increase and could prompt the Fed to raise rates even more.
The central bank left unchanged, at 4.5 percent, its discount rate on loans to banks. Its quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate could lead to an increase in loan rates for businesses and consumer credit like auto and home-equity loans. Many large banks raised their prime lending rates to 8 percent from 7.75 percent after the Fed completed its two-day policy meeting this afternoon.
But interest rates that are set directly or indirectly in the financial markets, like those on mortgages and corporate bonds, will depend on whether investors think the likelihood of further rate increases has been diminished and that inflation is no threat.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has warned over the last several months that although there is almost no inflation, there is an increasing risk that continued robust growth could push wages and then prices into an upward spiral.
Market interest rates had been moving higher over the last several months in anticipation of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, helping to cool off rate-sensitive sectors of the economy like housing. But economic indicators have given mixed signals in recent weeks about the prospects for slowing, and analysts said the Fed's shift to a neutral stance today was intended to say that the central bank would wait for more data before deciding how to proceed rather than that it was finished tightening monetary policy for the year.
"They wanted to signal to the market that they haven't prejudged the next move," said William Dudley of Goldman, Sachs. "In the end the decision is going to be dependent on the economic environment."
But some analysts said they now expected the Fed to tighten policy only when it had tangible evidence of brewing inflationary pressures, not just an expectation of them.
In explaining its decision, the Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee remained open to what has become known as the "new age" economic paradigm: that huge investments in computers and other technology have made businesses so much more efficient that the economy can run at much higher levels than in the past, and at lower rates of unemployment, without generating inflation.
"Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures," the committee said. "Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the F.O.M.C. has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action."
The statement went on, however, to emphasize that the Fed's tolerance for strong growth and low unemployment has its limits.
"The committee nonetheless recognizes that in the current dynamic environment, it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that might undermine growth," the statement said.
Since the Fed cut rates three times last fall, the economy has grown, and the financial crisis that started in Asia and spread around the world has abated. The central bank justified the rate increase today in those terms, saying "the full degree" of last fall's rate reductions is "no longer necessary" to keep financial markets well oiled and the economy in the United States on an even keel.
If history is any guide, the shift to a neutral policy stance, or bias, is no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates when it next meets on Aug. 24. The central bank has traditionally moved back to a neutral bias after raising rates even when another rate increase seemed likely. It maintained a neutral stance in 1994, for example, even as it was doubling the Federal funds rate to 6 percent from 3 percent.
What is different this time around is that the Fed is disclosing its policy bias publicly after each meeting. In 1994, and until earlier this year, it kept the bias a secret until after the subsequent policy meeting, meaning that the central bank was not using it to signal its intentions to the markets.
Whatever the Fed's intentions, the market's response today was to send stock prices higher, making consumers feel that much wealthier and willing to spend, and to bring down bond yields, providing a kick to the economy that could well offset whatever slowing effect the increase in official short-term rates accomplishes.
"In the process of making this announcement, the Fed has greatly reduced the odds that the economy is going to slow down," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "The fear of Greenspan has been removed from the financial markets. That means the restrictiveness on the economy that had been put in place based on the expectation of higher rates has been removed."
Investors could reassess their initial reaction in coming days, as they often do when it comes to the Fed's hints about policy. But they are most likely to take their cue from key indicators of growth and inflation in coming weeks, starting with job creation and the unemployment rate for June on Friday.
Still, an array of politicians and business executives who had been pressing Mr. Greenspan to show restraint in slowing the economy given the absence of inflation took heart from the Fed's signals today.
"Given the dearth of inflation and strong but steady growth, today's decision was, in my judgment, an error, but a minor one," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, which has long argued that the economy's potential for noninflationary growth is much higher than the Fed recognizes.
Robert B. Reich, the former Labor Secretary in the Clinton Administration, said the Fed had "exercised restraint" in its rate increase but said the central bank had yet to recognize that it should not sacrifice growth and jobs to fighting inflation that does not yet exist.
"The metaphor suggesting that a little inflation is like the genie out of the bottle is simply wrong," Mr. Reich said. "We know empirically that inflation can be stopped. More to the point, the lag between when the Fed acts and the response in the economy is actually very small, because financial markets are extraordinarily efficient and respond very quickly."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Hard Hearts Were Softened By a Boy's Tale

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
NOW that all of us supposedly savvy New Yorkers have been conned by a 13-year-old Honduran who speaks no English, what is there to say to him? Only a simple, heartfelt message:
Bienvenido a Nueva York! Nuestra casa es tu casa! 
 No one belongs in this city more than Edwin Daniel Sabillon, the teen-ager who arrived telling of an epic journey from Honduras. Those details happen not to be true, but his is still a quintessential New York success story.
Edwin got off the bus Sunday afternoon with $24 and a bag of cookies. By Tuesday, without benefit of a single phone call from Howard Rubenstein, his trip was making front-page news: "Incredible Journey," one headline aptly put it. The Mayor and the Police Commissioner were attending to his needs; literary agents were wondering if the book and movie rights would command six or seven figures.
Without a single pitch meeting, Edwin devised an irresistible plot: village boy loses family in hurricane, journeys across continent, wanders big city looking for dad. "Wizard of Oz" meets "Huckleberry Finn" meets "Home Alone II."
Now the story needs a little adjustment, but it still has commercial potential. It's a variation of "The Music Man." This time, instead of the slicker going to the provinces to hustle the bumpkins, the bumpkin comes to the city, but the result is the same: the slickers are seduced by the bumpkins.
It is a reasonably happy ending, partly because Edwin now stands to get help for the genuine troubles in his life, partly because his tale is a useful reminder that New Yorkers can be the world's biggest saps. While putting on a tough front, we're prone to falling for a tale like Edwin's because it touches our hidden fears.
The story of a naif lost thousands of miles from home resonated with the many people here -- half the population -- who came from somewhere else. Far from the safety net of families, New Yorkers competing for scarce jobs and paying exorbitant rents could play out through Edwin their own worst-case scenarios: one or two calamities, they imagine, and they too could be wandering the mean streets, impoverished and homeless.
Journalists have always worked hard to satisfy the appetites of tender-hearted New Yorkers, but it is not easy to maintain the production of newsworthy pathos. The facts all too often get in the way, as I discovered when I was assigned to the homeless beat nearly a decade ago.
The beat had plenty of grim stories, but the victims were generally not the sort of victim that readers identify with: a sober, industrious person in desperate shape because of bad breaks and society's indifference. The homeless men I met seemed afflicted mainly by drugs, alcohol and mental illness. They didn't spend a lot of time cursing the indifference of society.
Finally, though, I found a promising candidate named Jimmy, an affable, articulate young guy living in a shantytown on Donald Trump's land along the Hudson River in the West 60's. His wooden shack had a closet neatly arranged with dress shirts, ties and a half-dozen suits.
JIMMY seemed to be over the cocaine problem that had landed him in the streets. He had a part-time job at a soup kitchen, where he ladled out food and talked about how much he enjoyed helping his homeless neighbors still struggling with their demons. He said that he wanted to find a full-time job and move into an apartment, but that he was being thwarted by prejudice against the homeless.
"I'm ready to work," he said, "but if you don't already have a home and an address, you can't get past the job interview."
Eager to document this injustice, I accompanied him on a job-hunting expedition. We started at the state unemployment office, which sent him to the Swingline factory in Long Island City. He was promptly hired.
It wasn't the sad story I'd anticipated, but I kept monitoring his progress. Three days later he quit the job. "I don't like the commute," he explained. A week later he disappeared from the shantytown along with his wardrobe and his neighbors' possessions.
The neighbors in the shantytown were furious at the theft, but they did not share my astonishment at his duplicity. Nor were they surprised that a member of the press had fallen for a line. They seemed to realize one of the secrets of media relations in New York: to make it here, sometimes all you have to do is make it up.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Unified Europe Ends Most Duty-Free Shopping

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: ABOARD THE FERRYBOAT DOVER, in the English Channel, June 30

 BODY:
It was the last day of duty-free shopping bounty that Europeans have savored for five decades, and Stella Horton knew it.
With determination and vigor, Mrs. Horton, long a buyer of duty-free goods on the ferries that ply the Channel, set about snapping up what she assumed would be the final bargains in the closing hours before these sales within the 15-nation European Union end at midnight tonight. 
 Into her shopping basket went cigarettes at $2.50 a pack instead of $6.50 in Britain and Scotch at $20 instead of $30 a bottle. Total outlay: $160. Total savings over British retail prices: $180.
So slick was the duty-free shopping that she and her companion, Dennis Pointer, both retirees from Ramsgate, England, didn't even have to disembark when this car ferry -- a floating temple to discount sales of everything from single malts to CD's -- berthed briefly at Calais, France, then turned back for the 22-mile run to Dover, England.
But as Mrs. Horton and Mr. Pointer were shopping, duty-free operators like the P & O Stena Line, which runs this ship, and airport authorities across Europe were scrambling -- worried about what the end of duty-free shopping in and offshore European Union nations would mean for their own prosperity.
The European Union's decision to end such shopping was made eight years ago on the basis that duty-free sales skew Europe's vaunted single market. The International Duty-Free Confederation, a trade group made up mainly of airports and ferry companies, fought unsuccessfully to preserve the system, arguing that more than 140,000 jobs in the $6.5 billion annual business would be at risk.
Many have sought to devise alternate ways of selling such goods. Some are absorbing part of the costs themselves to keep discounted prices in their stores. German ferry operators are contemplating switching the destination of their "butter cruises" to neighboring Poland, outside European Union limits, just as Finnish ferry operators now say they will run duty-free shopping trips to Estonia, also outside the union.
Some British airport stores will continue to offer duty-free goods to travelers leaving the European Union for countries like the United States, Switzerland or Russia, while subsidizing discounted liquor and other goods, though not cigarettes, to travelers within the 15 countries -- all at the same airport stores.
French and German airport operators forecast higher prices for liquor and tobacco for European Union travelers, but according to Wolfgang Schwalm, a spokesman for Frankfurt Main International Airport, retailers will "reduce profit margins to maintain the current price level" on luxury goods like perfume.
Perhaps most curiously, ferries like this one will, as of Friday, offer goods at French hypermarket prices -- two-thirds that of many British shop prices because of lower excise taxes in France -- but only when the vessel is halfway across the Channel and out of British territorial waters.
For Europe's supposed single market, that means Britons will pay taxes to the French authorities for goods they consume back home in Britain, robbing their own tax collectors of revenue. The price of some purchases like Scotch whisky will stay the same, while cigarettes become more expensive, but still less costly than in Britain.
"I think it's a farce," said Jim Biggs, 48, from Deal in Kent, who was planning to shop in a low-priced French hypermarket today before returning to England. "I think a group of men in gray suits made a decision without understanding the economic consequences."
But the end of duty-free shopping also means the end of the limitations that European authorities placed on just how many duty-free cigarettes and bottles of liquor and perfume travelers could import -- generally 200 cigarettes, one liter of spirits and two liters of wine for each person.
"When they bring in the French taxes, we'll be able to bring in as much as we like," said Melvyn Lethaby, a crane driver from Dartford who was shopping with his daughter, Michelle May, and who had just bought 24 cans of Foster's lager for half the British price. (British customs officials say this is not quite true: travelers will be expected to honor an informal -- and nominal -- limit of 10 liters of spirits, 110 liters of beer and 800 cigarettes.)
BAA P.L.C., the British airport authority that runs Heathrow, London's principal airport, and six others, says it plans to spend around $70 million a year on subsidizing the prices paid for some goods, though not cigarettes or low-cost liquor, for sale to the 20 percent of passengers traveling within the European Union. The hope is that "where we are going to lose out by discounting, the volumes will increase," said Abigail Rowland, a BAA spokeswoman.
And Gail Isted, a spokeswoman for P & O Stena Line, which is a unit of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, said, "Duty-free was low volumes with high margins," acknowledging what many travelers had suspected for years: that duty-free purchases were not always the bargains they seemed.
At the same time, the spread of duty- and tax-free sales from liquor and tobacco to silk scarves and cameras had built a growing business on the balance sheets of ferry and airport operators and airlines. P & O Stena Line, for instance, says that the $200 million people spend each year on shopping, food and drinks contributes one-third of its income.
And BAA has increased landing fees by 5 percent to compensate for lost income from duty-free sales, deepening the fear that whatever is ultimately lost from ending the system will be passed along to fliers in the form of higher fares.
European duty-free shopping for travelers was introduced in Ireland in 1947. But with the concept of a European single market taking shape in the early 1990's, duty-free sales began to seem to some European officials like an anomaly that gave some businesses an unfair competitive advantage.
The argument went back and forth. In the end, Denmark persuaded wavering members of the European Union to stand firm against the urging of retailers and travelers that tonight's deadline be extended. The Danes did so at their peril.
"We aren't buying their Danish bacon no more," Mr. Pointer said. "That's for sure."

HEADLINE: Ailing Foreigners Burden Emergency Rooms in U.S.

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
They look like any of the anxious patients who walk into the city's polyglot emergency rooms.
But there are telltale signs.Sometimes they arrive with luggage and with tourist visas in their pockets. Often they have crumpled notes from doctors back home in China or Africa. 
 One man from the Dominican Republic flew into La Guardia Airport weak with fever, asked for an ambulance and presented himself at New York Presbyterian Hospital, where he announced that he had leukemia and needed help. Along with his suitcase, he carried his own intravenous drip.
They are known as medical immigrants, poor or middle-class foreigners who scrape and save to fly to New York, but not to join family, flee oppression or find work. Instead, they come solely to seek treatment at city emergency rooms, where Federal and state law says they must be examined and treated if their problems require immediate care.
Doctors say that such patients have been gravitating to the city in modest numbers for years, mostly to the city's public hospitals. While New York appears to receive the brunt, hospitals in Chicago, Houston and Miami also report treating a steady stream of medical immigrants, mostly from poor countries.
No one is able to say exactly how many there are or how much their care costs hospitals. And in part, this is a policy decision. Many emergency departments, fearing the anti-immigrant sentiment that has restricted access to health care in California and other states, resist counting such patients or pressing them about where they came from if they do not volunteer that information.
"Should I wonder whether this is the guy from Third Avenue who doesn't have any money or the guy from the third world who doesn't have any?" asked Dr. Lewis Goldfrank, emergency services director at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. "That's not my job," he said. "I'm a doctor."
But especially in New York, those who keep an eye on city hospitals' precarious finances say that if something does not change, the hospitals will not be able to keep their emergency room doors open to the world.
Medical immigrants are a tiny but striking example of a larger and growing problem of uninsured or underinsured patients -- both citizens and immigrants, legal and illegal -- who rely on emergency rooms as clinics for everything from colds to cancer.
According to the New York State Health Department, city hospitals provided $1.2 billion in care to those who could not pay in 1997, the last year for which figures are available. The same year, the state collected only $635 million in a charity pool used for such care, most of which went to city hospitals. The pool is financed through taxes on hospitals and insurers.
In addition to the shortfall, New York's percentage of uninsured people, 19.1 percent, is not only higher than the country's, but is growing faster. Medical immigrants are only a sliver of this group, but Patricia Wang, a senior vice president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, called the phenomenon "a tremendous concern to hospitals as the number of uninsured grows."
"It's another thing that's putting a lot of stress on hospital budgets," she said.
The patients come from all over the world, many with long-neglected, serious illnesses. Just after 2 on Sunday morning, a newly arrived Honduran woman showed up at Elmhurst Hospital's emergency room, and doctors determined that she had an aggressive form of cancer.
Last year, Dr. Goldfrank treated a West African with kidney failure who had sold his house and possessions to travel to Guinea for dialysis. He could not get help there, but tacked to a bulletin board in the hospital was an announcement saying that if patients could get to Bellevue or Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris they would get free dialysis.
The man, whose name was not released, flew to New York last February and walked into the emergency room with almost fatal levels of potassium in his blood, Dr. Goldfrank said. He was stabilized and has remained in New York for weekly dialysis, paid for with emergency Medicaid money that require mountains of paperwork for the hospital.
When Bellevue officials asked the man whether he would be willing to be interviewed, provided that his name not be used, he became so frightened that nurses in the dialysis program worried that he would not show up for his treatments again.
"These are people who are on a mission to save their lives," Dr. Goldfrank said. "It's their last resort before they give up. And it can be a very courageous journey they're taking."
Not all cities are as welcoming. At Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, officials have begun to make access much harder when patients cannot prove legal residency or an ability to pay. They might be stabilized in the emergency room but not admitted. Or if their condition is not immediately life-threatening, they may be told to go to the hospital's clinic, where they must pay a fee before being seen.
 
Taking the Drastic Step: Alerting the Authorities
Recently, Jackson has even begun taking the most drastic step: alerting immigration authorities if hospital administrators determine that a patient's condition can be treated in his home country. When this leads to deportation, the hospital will sometimes pick up the cost of the airline ticket, many thousands of dollars cheaper than the care they might otherwise have provided.
"We have to draw a line, and we're doing it more and more," said Maria Rosa Gonzalez, a spokeswoman. "The county has made it very clear that our first responsibility is to the people of Miami-Dade County. And we're not ashamed to admit that."
In California, the flow of medical immigrants has slowed considerably since the 1994 passage of Proposition 187, which sought to deny most medical help to illegal immigrants and require doctors to report them to the police. While the measure has been mostly dismantled in court, uncertainty among immigrants about whether they will be treated has deterred them from traveling to California for medical care.
But New York doctors who see such patients say they would never deny care because of economics or immigration status, even though in some cases the law might allow them to discharge the patients once they are stabilized.
"From my point of view, I'm just interested in getting them taken care of," said Dr. Stuart Kessler, the director of the emergency department at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, another city emergency room frequently sought out by such patients because of its diverse neighborhood and proximity to airports. "Whether it's a strain on resources or not, that's an issue I can debate some other time."
 
Many Patients Lie About Visit's Purpose
Bellevue estimates that it may see a few dozen patients a year who doctors or social workers determine have traveled to the country just for medical care. But hospital officials believe there are probably dozens more patients who lie, thinking they are more likely to receive treatment if they claim they came to the city for a vacation or to find work and then fell ill. Elmhurst officials say they may see a few patients a month who they know to be medical immigrants.
"They are the patients all the doctors talk about," said Dr. Kessler, who said he is always struck by those who bring doctors' notes or medical charts. "This is not a letter from a doctor down the street. It's from another part of the world."
In New York City, the number of these patients appears to have risen only slightly over the years, probably because of obvious barriers, doctors say. First, the patients must be able to get a tourist or temporary visa in their countries and come up with the money for the airline ticket. They must also have a certain level of sophistication to know that they will indeed be treated once they show up. Sometimes this knowledge comes from friends or relatives who live in New York and take them to the hospital after they arrive.
In other cases, underequipped hospitals in third world countries actually urge seriously ill patients, like the West African with kidney failure, to go to New York as a last resort.
The man from the Dominican Republic who showed up at New York Presbyterian was lucky. He got a bone marrow transplant, said a former doctor at the hospital. But sometimes, Dr. Goldfrank says, the patients arrive too late. A few years ago, a man in Mexico City who knew he had serious heart problems began having chest pains and got on a plane. He landed, took a cab to Bellevue and walked into the emergency room in shock. He died several days later.
New York doctors say they have seen no patterns of immigrants from specific countries or regions, but for the last several years they have noticed several South Americans with AIDS, West Africans with kidney failure and Chinese with cancer.
Sometimes they arrive straight from the airport, with no contacts in New York other than the doctors and nurses who help them. More commonly, friends or relatives in the city familiar with a certain hospital take the patient to the emergency room within a few days of his arrival.
Some of the immigrant traffic may be an unintended side effect of occasional good-will missions by public and private hospitals, which bring in foreign patients from impoverished or war-torn countries in need of complicated surgeries or treatments. These patients get special medical visas, they usually have the support of a charity, and the cases generate a huge amount of publicity for the hospitals. It is publicity sometimes seen around the world as an invitation to free care at New York's emergency rooms.
"There's apparently good word of mouth about us in Mongolia, which is nice to know," said Pam McDonnell, the director of communications at Bellevue.
 
A Complaint of Patients Sent to Public Hospitals
 The city's public hospitals complain that when medical immigrants, especially those with serious illnesses, show up on the doorsteps of private hospitals, they may be stabilized and then shipped over to a public hospital for the costly surgery or long stay.
Francesco Santoni-Rugiu, an Italian cardiologist who is leaving Mount Sinai Medical Center to return to practice in Italy, said doctors at private hospitals would like to keep the patients because they often have medical conditions either no longer as common in the United States or virtually unheard of, like leprosy.
"But probably," he said, "the hospital isn't going to be in favor of admitting these people."
They often end up at Bellevue.
Last year, the social work staff there took a statistical snapshot of the admitted patient population on one day, Dec. 3. The report was mostly to determine the size of the homeless population, but it found something that surprised administrators. Of the 701 patients, 166 were not United States citizens and 70 were ineligible for government entitlements, meaning that they were probably illegal immigrants.
No one can say how many of the 70 had entered the United States specifically for medical help, but Patricia Blau, deputy director of the Social Work Department, estimated that it was probably over half.
"I think some of the medical staff were surprised with the numbers we found," she said. "But we weren't. The word is on the streets, so to speak, that if you come in these doors, you will not be turned away."

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns That Arms Race May Begin Between Koreas

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is increasingly worried that South Korea may be pushing ahead with several missile projects that could further fuel an arms race on the Korean Peninsula, just as North Korea appears to be preparing another launch of a long-range missile.
Administration officials say they will raise their concerns that a South Korean missile program could destabilize an already dangerous situation when South Korea's President, Kim Dae Jung, visits Washington on Friday. 
 Two weeks ago, the South sank a North Korean vessel in a firefight along their coastal border that resulted in more than 20 deaths.
While the two Presidents will publicly declare that they have agreed on a common strategy for dealing with the North, one senior Administration official said that the South Koreans feel "unduly constrained" by a two-decade-old agreement that sharply limits their ability to deploy a powerful fleet of missiles as a deterrent.
The political pressure in Seoul to deploy such missiles is bound to grow if the North fires another Taepo Dong missile over the Sea of Japan in the coming weeks. Today, Kurt M. Campbell, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Affairs, was the first Administration official to acknowledge publicly that American intelligence had detected "some preparations" for a launch in coming weeks or months.
"We'd view any potential launch of either a satellite or a missile as a very serious act with very real consequences for U.S. foreign policy toward North Korea," he said.
The North's first launch, on Aug. 31 last year, took American intelligence agencies by surprise and set off outrage in Japan. The test seemed intended to demonstrate that the North could strike Tokyo and any of the bases where 55,000 American troops are stationed in Japan. Japan threatened to pull out of an accord under which it is providing much of the financing to build electric-power stations in the North, the quid pro quo for Pyongyang, the North's capital, to agree to freeze its nuclear weapons program.
William Perry, a former Defense Secretary who now is President Clinton's special adviser on North Korea, warned North Korea during a visit to Pyongyang last month that a second missile test could endanger the Administration's effort to begin a slow normalization of relations with the Communist country, including a gradual lifting of economic sanctions. Mr. Perry will meet with Mr. Kim on Friday.
Mr. Campbell said today that despite the warnings, North Korea could have several motivations to defy the United States and allies and proceed with the test launch.
"There is a very real desire to put a satellite in space," he said, referring to the North's claim that last year's launch propelled a small satellite into a low orbit, where the North claims it has broadcast songs hailing achievements of North Korea's founder, the late Kim Il Sung. "There is also a desire to develop their missile program," he said.
But as they try to convince North Korea to end its missile tests, Washington is also scrambling to urge President Kim to resist growing political pressure in the South to develop longer-range missiles that can strike targets throughout the North.
In the late 1970's, after the United States discovered and terminated a South Korean effort to build a nuclear weapon of its own, Seoul agreed not to build missiles with a range greater than 180 kilometers, or about 108 miles. That limit puts Pyongyang just out of reach of South Korea's existing missile batteries.
On April 10, however, South Korea launched a surface-to-surface missile, the Hyonmu, from an island off its west coast. It traveled only a short distance, but reports at the time suggested that its fuel tank was only partially filled, so that the United States would not discover the true range of the weapon.
Some American intelligence officials are now casting doubt on the assessment that the South limited the test to avoid American suspicions. But Mr. Kim's Government has not shared much information with the Pentagon about its plans for its missile program.
A senior military official said he believed that South Korea had "a fairly determined national program to create capabilities that are competitive with the North Korean capability." They also do not want to be overly dependent on the United States to supply all of their weaponry, officials said. Some South Korean officials have complained that the United States is not being tough enough on the North about its missile program, while pressuring Seoul to contain its own development programs.
Two American officials said that the United States might be willing to extend the permissible range of South Korea's missiles to roughly 180 miles.
That might ease the domestic pressure on President Kim , while keeping South Korea within the limits of an international agreement to restrict missile proliferation. Neither North Korea nor South Korea has signed the agreement.

A Quarter-Point Increase
The Fed nudged its benchmark interest rate up by a quarter of a percentage point, but said there was no clear case for another rate increase to keep inflation at bay. The increase, to 5 percent from 4.75 percent, came after three separate quarter-point rate reductions last fall, during the global financial crisis. A1

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.
* denotes a highly recommended show. 

Museums
 
"THE AMERICAN CENTURY: ART AND CULTURE, 1900-1950," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Aug. 22). This is the first half of a marathon end-of-an-era survey. (Part 2, covering 1950-2000, opens on Sept. 26.) It flows chronologically through four floors of the museum's galleries, resulting in a show of substantial if circumscribed pleasures. Most of the 600 paintings, drawings and sculptures are familiar icons from a canonical art history, one in need of shaking up. But if what is here is short on fresh insights, there are wonderful things to look at. And by the time you've worked your way from Gilded Age society portraits on the top floor to Jackson Pollock below, you've had a genuine time-travel experience: exhausting, diverting, sometimes moving, even pride-inspiring. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
"COLLECTING IN DEPTH: DRAWINGS BY GROSZ, SCHWITTERS, ERNST AND KLEE," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9400 (through July 20). While a little on the dry side, this exhibition effectively encapsulates the careers of four major German modernists, layering their sensibilities like a sandwich and demonstrating the singular uses that each artist found for Cubism. For the outer layers, George Grosz and Paul Klee reformed the tensile lines and transparencies of Analytic Cubism for the purposes, respectively, of scathing social satire and psychologically charged fusions of fantasy and form. In between, Kurt Schwitters and Max Ernst took innovations of Synthetic Cubist collage into new territory. Schwitters used the detritus of everyday life to create a streetwise formalism that indexed different kinds of social interaction and human contact. Ernst extracted found images from their natural habitat in the public press to create a universe as fully imaged as Klee's, only scarier. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 5:45 P.M.; Fridays, to 8:15 P.M. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
* "CROSSCURRENTS: MASTERPIECES OF EAST ASIAN ART FROM NEW YORK PRIVATE COLLECTIONS," Japan Society Gallery, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through July 11). The strength of New York private collecting in Asian art is confirmed in this beautiful show. It begins with a heart-lifting 13th-century Japanese wood carving of the bodhisattva Jizo, protector of travelers and children, and ends with an installation of tea ceremony utensils from China, Korea and Japan. In between come paintings, porcelains and lacquer, all exemplary. A big, expansive accomplishment for the Japan Society. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $5 (Cotter).
 
"FROM CEZANNE TO VAN GOGH: THE COLLECTION OF DR. GACHET," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 15). A show of works from the collection of a homeopathic physician and amateur painter named Paul-Ferdinand Gachet (1828-1909). He was one of those curious figures of French bohemia, an intimate of Courbet, Champfleury and Baudelaire and later a friend to painters like Monet, van Gogh and Cezanne, whose works he collected when they were still unrecognized. Some of these works are great, others so bad that doubts have been raised about their authenticity. Any show that invites you to contemplate the difference between fake van Goghs and poor van Goghs is, as you might expect, not altogether visually thrilling. But it has an instructive value as an exercise in comparative viewing, and this is not negligible. It also includes relics like van Gogh's palette that have an extraordinary talismanic appeal, which often exceeds the attraction of the pictures. Hours: Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 8:45 P.M. Suggested admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
 
"IMPRESSIONISTS IN WINTER: EFFETS DE NEIGE," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 29). Think of the Impressionists and chances are you think green: lawns, hedges and fertile fields of a deciduous nature caught at full leaf. But these artists were year-round workers, and winter landscapes, rendered in the frosty open air or through the glass of a studio window, figured in their repertory. Here are some 60 such paintings. And if ever a show were tailor-made for summer viewing, this one is. Its size is untaxing, and its deep-freeze images of snow-covered fields and ice-caked trees are the visual equivalent of air-conditioning. Of course, much of the work by Monet, Pissarro, Sisley and their colleagues is extremely beautiful in that immediate, you-have-to-be-there Impressionist way. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Thursdays, to 8 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. (to 11 P.M. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $9.50; $7.50, students over 10 and the elderly (Cotter).
 
"A MEASURED QUIETUDE: CONTEMPORARY IRISH DRAWINGS," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166 (through July 31). Judging from these drawings by seven Irish artists, Minimalism and to a lesser extent Post-Minimalism are the lingua franca of international contemporary art. Thus the exceptions stand out, including Liadin Cooke's odd little drawings whose isolated shapes suggest bone shards, maps and landscapes and whose tiny texts evoke "The Iliad," but are actually from de Sade; Colin Darke's elegant little drawing-texts that feature writings of Lenin and Trotsky copied in minuscule script onto cigarette papers -- a well-known method among political prisoners in Northern Ireland for passing secret messages. Across the street in the Center's Drawing Room, the frescolike white-on-black wall drawings of John Kindness update the Attic vase style of Classical Greek and recasts Herakles as a fearless Belfast youth. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Free (Smith).
 
* "THE MEDIEVAL HOUSEBOOK: A VIEW OF 15TH-CENTURY LIFE," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through July 25). Mystery still surrounds the vivacious 15th-century German manuscript known as the Medieval Housebook. For example, who were the artists? Part idyll, part real-life manual for the landed gentry, the housebook touches on such miscellaneous matters as astronomy, astrology, courtly love, chivalry, mining, metallurgy, jousting, warfare, recipes, medications, castle defense, animal husbandry and the trapping of men by female predators. In its exquisitely detailed drawings, a mischievous mix of the elegant and the bawdy, men and women conduct lofty amours and earthy functions, the raffish mingle with the raffine, and sybarites are far more evident than saints. A secular sanctuary in a religious era, the manuscript captures the spirit of a world that's bygone yet very much a prologue to our own. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Sundays, 1 to 6 P.M. Admission: $7; $5, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).
 
GUSTAVE MOREAU, "Between Epic and Dream," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 22). The first retrospective in this country in 35 years for Gustave Moreau, the French painter who ignored the art of his own time and, firing his imagination with story lines and stylistic tips lifted from various past cultures, created an art for the future. His highly finished paintings, with their opulent detail and hothouse emotionality, look as intensely strange and decadent as ever. His independence and ability to create a complete, self-sustaining esthetic universe is particularly pertinent today, when the dearth of clear-cut art movements makes many artists feel like loners. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
* "EL NUEVO MUNDO: THE LANDSCAPE OF LATINO LOS ANGELES," Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 (through Sept. 5). For more than two decades, the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara has documented the process of physical change in the poorest neighborhoods in American cities. The story is often one of disintegration, but in the color pictures here he turns his eye on the largely Mexican community in Los Angeles, where transplanted cultural roots are in photogenic flower. Life is hard, but houses, stores and city walls are painted with vivid images of religious icons, consumer goods and yearned-for south-of-the-border vistas. Mr. Vergara's career-long project is an important one; this show is a vivid installment in his expansive fieldwork. And it takes on an extra resonance at the Cooper-Hewitt, a former Andrew Carnegie mansion. Hours: Tuesdays, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Wednesdays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $5; children under 12 and the elderly, $3 (Cotter).
 
* "SURREALISM: TWO PRIVATE EYES," the Nesuhi Ertegun and Daniel Filipacchi Collections, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 12). The Surrealist collections formed by two friends fill the museum from lobby to ceiling. Although it has more than 700 objects, this powerful show is by no means a comprehensive survey but an intense, close-up experience of Surrealism that might be imparted by two obsessed acquisitors taking you on a personal tour of their treasures. Highlights include clusters of paintings by Dali, Victor Brauner, Magritte, Andre Masson and Yves Tanguy; a splendid group of boxes by Joseph Cornell; a brilliant selection of photographs rife with portraits by Man Ray; dozens of beautifully bound books, and remarkable drawings by Hans Bellmer and Masson. The show has notable omissions and a few surprising inclusions, but by and large the menu is gourmet. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 8 P.M. Admission: $12; $7, students and the elderly (Glueck).
 
* "TO CONSERVE A LEGACY: AMERICAN ART FROM HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES," Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through July 11). The 200 works on view, drawn from the collections of six educational institutions and spanning more than a century, form a lively and eclectic gathering in which Georgia O'Keeffe and Romare Bearden, Edmonia Lewis and Arthur Dove, the ultra-urbane Charles Demuth and the ecstatic self-taught Minnie Evans keep kindred-spirit, all-American company. The exhibition serves as a lesson in the intricacies of art conservation, an introduction to the endlessly absorbing subject of American education and a richly deserved 30th-birthday celebration for the Studio Museum itself. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 1 to 6 P.M. Admission: $5; $3, students and the elderly. Admission is free the first Saturday of each month (Cotter).
 
"0044," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Aug. 29). The work of 20 Irish artists who live and work in London, whose work sometimes addresses Irish themes and sometimes doesn't. Although the level of professionalism is uniformly high, most of the artists are pursuing familiar strategies of painting, sculpture, installation or video art. Look for Frances Hegarty's video self-portrait, Liadin Cooke's aluminum casts of small rough balls of Irish clay, Kathy Prendergast's drawings of the world's rivers and lakes, Tina O'Connell's installation pieces (which riff on Post-Minimalists like Robert Smithson, Carl Andre and Lynda Benglis without losing their identity) and Daphne Wright's walk-in environment of tall craggy outcroppings of aluminum foil, each accompanied by its own tiny foil seagull. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $5 (Smith).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
"CHARLES HENRI FORD: PRINTED MATTER, 1929-1969," Ubu Gallery, 16 East 78th Street, (212) 794-4444 (through July 16). This revelatory exhibition covers four decades of the busy career of Charles Henri Ford, poet, novelist, editor and publisher. It includes copies of Blues: A Magazine of New Rhythms, which Mr. Ford founded in 1929, at the age of 19, and of View, notable for its artist-designed covers, which he created and oversaw in the 1940's. But it is dominated by the less well-known "Poem Posters" that Mr. Ford made in 1964-65. These, in turn, are dominated by acid colors, chains of verse spliced together like a kidnapper's ransom note and pop culture images, Jayne Mansfield among them. They may be high Pop Art, but they are also the culmination of Mr. Ford's long involvement with Surrealism, whose strategies find new expression here (Smith).
 
ARISTODIMOS KALDIS, Lori Bookstein Fine Art, 50 East 78th Street, (212) 439-9605 (through July 14) and Foundation for Hellenic Culture, 7 West 57th Street, (212) 308-6908 (through Aug. 31). The ebullient work of the Turkish-born, Greek-bred painter Kaldis (1899-1979) was always based on the Mediterranean landscape of his childhood. In his earlier canvases, sunny, lively colors, simple lines and sparsely detailed forms made up sweet scenes of seaside life. Later, his work became more complex. The forms grew more abstract; the canvases got bigger, and his compositions exploded spatially, allowing large areas of white to dominate, punctuated by dashes and bursts of color that stood for landscape elements. A catchy lyrical harmony informs these later paintings (at the Foundation), keeping them fresh (Glueck).
 
JAN MATULKA, Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through July 30). This exhibition of harbor scenes presents Matulka (1890-1972), one of the lesser known but more engaging of American Early Modernists, at his most appealing. The paintings offer views of seaside houses, sheds and wharves, rocky shores, cozy, blue bays and chunky, toylike boats robustly painted in a brightly colored, chunky style that looks like a marriage of folk art and Cubism (Ken Johnson).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
ELLIOTT GREEN, JANE HAMMOND, DAVID TRUE, TREVOR WINKFIELD, Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050 (through July 26). Each of the painters in this well-selected show has developed his or her own idiosyncratic mix of Pop, Surrealism and figurative narrative. They harmonize well together, but Mr. True's big, zany cartoon version of the Biblical Expulsion, with its eerie population of rubbery, incandescently hued characters, steals the show (Johnson).
 
JASPER JOHNS, Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331 (through July 31). Familiar Johnsian motifs are here embodied in prints from the 60's, 70's and 80's: the numbers 0 through 9 stenciled one over another; three versions of brushes in a Savarin coffee can; five expansive, hatchwork abstractions; a blotchy, black-and-white double flag; and the autobiographical suite "Four Seasons." Johns's distinctively deft, matter-of-fact touch animates them all (Johnson).
 
ALICE TRUMBULL MASON, Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through July 23). Descended from a prominent Colonial New England family, Mason (1904-1971) studied with Arshile Gorky in the late 1920's. As this selection of works from four decades proves, she remained devoted to abstraction throughout her long, under-recognized career. Her modestly scaled paintings, always rigorously structured, sensuously painted and richly colored, were influenced by Miro early on and later by Mondrian, but they always have their own engaging personality (Johnson).
 
JOHN McLAUGHLIN, Ameringer Howard, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 935-1110 (through July 30). McLaughlin (1898-1976) dealt in Asian antiquities and served as a high-ranking translator during World War II before moving to California and, at age 50, beginning his distinguished career as a painter of austere, Zen-inspired abstractions. This show presents five dry, near-Minimalist rectilinear canvases and a series of lithographs from which Peter Halley might have gotten the barred windows of his cell paintings (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
BARTON LIDICE BENES, Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Spring Street, (212) 941-0012 (through July 30). Mr. Benes produces modern reliquaries: broad, shallow boxes divided into little cubbyholes, each containing a labeled, more or less sacred relic. Among the items displayed in "Celebrity" you'll find a police badge worn by Sean Penn in the movie "Colors" and a wad of Dustin Hoffman's chewing gum. These devotional works are for a Warholian world where the gods have devolved into celebrities (Johnson).
 
ROSS BLECKNER, Betsy Senior, 375 West Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 941-0960 (through Aug. 27). The 10 new etchings in this show correspond to the large cellular abstract paintings Mr. Bleckner exhibited last fall. Patterns of luminous, blurry lines and glowing dots are Bleckneresque but the prints don't have the magical illusionism of the paintings (Johnson).
 
"INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION," Curt Marcus, 578 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 226-3200 (through July 9). The five painters in this exhibition work in various styles but are united by a predilection for painterly richness and conscientious craft. Included are Matthew Abbot's dazzingly complicated Pop mandalas; Elizabeth Saveri's small, charmingly unassuming realist pictures; lovely, subtly patterned and layered abstractions by Dean Smith; luminous, crusty abstractions by Richard Tsao and lush grids by David Collins (Johnson).
 
TOBA KHEDOORI, David Zwirner, 43 Greene Street, (212) 966-9074 (through July 9). This Australia-born Californian continues to do what she's been celebrated for since she emerged about five years ago. On vast, dirty and waxy paper surfaces she floats delicate, subtly tinted schematic pictures of architecture or furniture: a corner of a room where two doors stand ajar; a child's-size desk and chair; a cityscape of simple, building-shaped blocks. The drawings are formulaic but poetic and sensuously material (Johnson).
 
ANTOINE PEVSNER, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through July 31). This remarkable exhibition presents 120 drawings done from 1912 to 1956 by one of the original Russian Constructivists. Made in graphite in an elasticized Cubist style, they realize Pevsner's fantasy of Machine Age dynamism more persuasively than do his sculptures, which today look clunky and dated. Artists who continue to explore the possibilities of abstraction might find this collection a rich source of ideas (Johnson).
 
"SAMPLING," Ronald Feldman Gallery, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232 (through July 9). For this big, end-of-season group exhibition, Feldman got in touch with art galleries in Europe, Australia, India, Japan and Egypt, asking them for works by artists they represent. Almost three dozen are on view here. The information-gathering idea is a terrific one, and if the results, drawing on a global pool of styles and media, are intriguing rather than earth-shaking, there are artists here one looks forward to hearing from again soon. One of them is Christine Hill, who contributes a funny and slightly mystifying installation of posters ("Where exactly are we going?" reads one) related to walking tours of New York City that she will be conducting through the summer. Among the highlights she promises are a McDonald's with a doorman and a former residence of Conan O'Brien. Tour price: $12; information (212) 802-7383 (Cotter).
 
JOAQUIN TORRES-GARCIA, Cecilia de Torres, 140 Greene Street, (212) 431-5869 (through July 31). This show of small paintings and drawings on paper commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Uruguayan-born modernist's death. Torres Garcia's gridded, pictographic works, by which he articulated a comprehensive cosmic philosophy with an unassuming, comic touch, are especially engaging (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
SAINT CLAIR CEMIN, Cheim & Read, 521 West 23d Street, (212) 242-7727 (through July 31). Mr. Cemin, one of his generation's most inventive sculptors (he was born in 1951) presents five marmoreal mock monuments, including a sphinx with a smoothly finished woman's face and a roughly carved body; an archaic, a cartoonish horse pierced by a stainless steel spear, and a square wind-filled sail carved from a single block of stone (Johnson).
 
RITA McBRIDE AND SYLVIA PLIMACK MANGOLD, Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, (212) 367-7474 (through July 30). Ms. McBride's installation focuses obliquely on the concept of the art exhibition. Three sets of curvy, wooden bleachers invite viewers to sit and look at a picture on the wall, which will periodically change (first up was a Cindy Sherman self-portrait as a secretary from 1978). Ms. Mangold's Precisionist painting of a ruler on a wooden floor reflected in a wood-framed mirror and a more recent Cezannesque portrait of a tree echo the woodiness of the bleachers (Johnson).
 
B. G. MUHN, Stux, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 352-1600 (through July 31). Mr. Muhn, who was born in Korea and teaches at Georgetown University, produces crafty, surrealistic paintings combining abstract elements, luminous color fields and images that may be highly finished or loosely sketched. Mood ranges from portentous to absurd as in the picture of a rabbit with a big pink tongue on a tormented-looking bald man's head (Johnson).
 
"SUMMER GROUP EXHIBITION," DCA, 525 West 22d Street, (212) 255-5511 (through July 17). This presentation of 11 Danish artists is remarkable mainly for how derivative the works are. Kehnet Nielsen's abstract paintings look like Clyfford Still's; Bjarne Werner Sorensen's layered networks are like Terry Winters's; Erik A. Frandsen's snapshot-based enamel picture is like a Gary Hume. But Michael Kvium's strange painting of paunchy men in underwear brandishing sock puppets and doing something weirdly erotic has an eccentric personality of its own (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
"EVE'S VOCABULARY," Brookdale Center, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 674-5300 (through July 16). Deborah Rosenthal's paintings from 1988-98 take inspiration from the biblical figure of Eve, but place her -- and sometimes Adam -- in an overall scheme that puts vigorous emphasis on abstraction and decorative patterning. The Matissean colors are vivid, almost tropical, likewise the stylized vegetal forms that often invade the composition. Although they express Ms. Rosenthal's consciousness of her Jewishness, the word "religious" doesn't quite fit. Their buoyancy of spirit is infectious (Glueck).
 
ROMUALD HAZOUME, The Project, 421 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 662-8610 (through July 25). The first United States show of this West African artist includes two dozen small, mask-like sculptures made from industrial and commercial materials: detergent jugs, video cassette casings, electric fan blades. Mr. Hazoume is a deft and witty assemblagist of objects and ideas: references to traditional art, consumer culture and an economy of recycling are all touched on here. In the back gallery are seven airy paintings of oracular pictographic forms painted on layers of earth. A welcome debut (Cotter).
 
BYRON KIM, Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42d Street, (917) 663-2453 (through July 16). Mr. Kim likes to imbue modernist modes like monochromatic painting with oblique political overtones. Here he has created subtle, mural-scale wall drawings using gray washes pigmented by dust vacuumed up around the Philip Morris building, orchestrating a marriage of high formalism and low materialism. One wall bears the ghost image of a brick wall with blocked-up windows. The others are entirely abstract (Johnson).
 
"WHEN TIME BEGAN TO RANT AND RAVE: FIGURATIVE PAINTING FROM 20th-CENTURY IRELAND," Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through July 24). This begins with works influenced by Impressionism and Post-Impressionism and ends with routine versions of 80's Neo-Expressionism. Rife with derivative, over-earnest work, it is most valuable as a reflection of Ireland's painful history and its effect on its art. It makes palpable the tensions between artists who wanted to keep abreast of international (mostly French) developments in art and those who disdained modernism and celebrated Irish rural life or the struggle for independence. Its highpoints are few, but include the work of Jack B. Yeats, whose thickly painted Expressionist works succeed in fusing distinctly Irish predicaments and states of mind with an original, contemporary style (Smith).
 
Last Chance
 
ASHLEY BICKERTON, Sonnabend, 420 West Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 966-6160 (through today). These new, bizarre figurative paintings by a former Neo Geo artist are by turns funny, perplexing and sophomoric. "The Vlaminkos" presents three people, each caught in a web of illusion: a tied-up masochist, a corpulent New Age woman complacently meditating in the nude and a teen-age boy simultaneously listening to a Walkman, playing a Gameboy and smoking. Mr. Bickerton captures the spiritual nightmare of modernity with visionary exuberance (Johnson).
 
"ELLSWORTH KELLY: 'SCULPTURE FOR A LARGE WALL' AND OTHER RECENT ACQUISITIONS," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Tuesday). The Modern is celebrating its recent acquisition of Mr. Kelly's sensational "Sculpture for a Large Wall" (1956-57) with other pieces from its holdings by this luminous and original artist. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
* JAMES ENSOR, Shepherd & Derom Galleries, 58 East 79th Street, (212) 861-4050 (through tomorrow). Two dozen exquisite etchings from the early and most innovative period in the career of James Ensor (1860-1949), the visionary painter of masks, skeletons and devils, are presented in this show. Ensor's delight in human venality and foolishness is wonderfully realized throughout, especially in a series devoted to the seven deadly sins that looks as if it could have been drawn yesterday by the underground comic artist R. Crumb. (Johnson)
 
* "MIRROR OF THE MEDIEVAL WORLD," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). This glowing showcase of some 300 medieval objects acquired by the Met over the last 20 years includes silver chalices, ivory plaques, stained-glass panels and carved wooden sculptures. Some have long been on view in various parts of the museum, and others are being shown for the first time. Like any survey of its kind, knockout masterpieces mingle with works meant to fill in historical gaps, and dates are all over the place. But the staggering material wealth and spiritual energy of an epoch come through. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
KENNY SCHACHTER, Sandra Gering, 476 Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 226-8195 (through today). Mr. Schachter, who is best known as a roving curator-entrepreneur, here presents his own artwork, a line of mock commodities called "Shovelware." The best things in this uneven show are a set of dining utensils in the form of miniature tools, like shovels and pitchforks, and an artists' sperm bank: an industrial-strength tank containing frozen semen samples from several semi-famous artists, available for $750 a pop (Johnson).

Museum Fills a Gap In Its Dutch Paintings
When J. Patrice Marandel, the curator of European painting and sculpture at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, attended the Maastricht art fair in the Netherlands four months ago, he spotted exactly what he'd been seeking for the museum's permanent collection: a first-rate painting from the Utrecht School. 
 "Mocking of Christ," by the Dutch master Gerrit van Honthorst, is a haunting image in which the artist used a candle to cast shadows on the figures he painted, in this case to depict the suffering of Jesus dramatically. It is a theme the artist explored several times. But while there are at least five known versions of the painting, this one, Mr. Marandel believes, is among the artist's best.
"When I came to the museum six years ago, I realized that we really needed a painting of this school," he said. "The emotion in this picture and the dignified treatment of the subject make it particularly special. It will be the museum's first Hont horst."
Painted around 1617, when the artist was in Rome working with Caravaggio, "Mocking of Christ" was unpublished and unknown to scholars until Rob Smeets, a Milan dealer, exhibited it at the art fair.
"It was known to Prof. J. Richard Judson, who is writing a new catalogue raisonne of the artist's work," Mr. Marandel said. "We know it had been in a private Dutch collection."
But because of the gaps in its provenance, especially during the middle years of the 20th century, Mr. Marandel said, he spent considerable time confirming that at no point was it looted during World War II.
The painting was acquired for the museum through the Ahmanson Foundation, based in Los Angeles, which has been the museum's biggest benefactor in European paintings. The painting helps to flesh out the Caravaggesque pictures already in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's collection, especially Georges de La Tour's "Magdalen With the Smoking Flame" (circa 1640) and Valentin de Boulogne's "Musical Party" (1626).
The Honthorst will go on view in the fall, Mr. Marandel said, after some minor conservation and restoration work.
 
Privatizing the Biennale
Over the next several years the Venice Biennale is to go from a Government-run entity to a private profit-seeking organization, one that will hold year-round arts events in all disciplines.
"We're looking for joint ventures with private organizations and corporations to help fund us," said Giovanna Legnani, the general director of the Biennale, who is working with its president, Paolo Baratta, to make the change happen. "If we succeed, we hope this will be an economic model that will be copied at other Biennales around the world."
The Italian Government passed a law in February allowing the Venice Biennale, which costs about $10 million a year to produce, to become a private cultural organization. While the art world thinks of it as an art fair that happens every two years, the organizers of the Biennale actually oversee a host of other cultural activities in Venice, including a film festival every September and biennales in such fields as music, theater, dance and architecture, held sporadically during the summer.
Despite the name biennale, some events occur every year.
"The Biennale is a gold mine that's never been exploited," Ms. Legnani said. "I have a mandate to make it profitable and self-sufficient in four years."
Although it has been 50 percent financed by the Italian Government, with the rest raised through admissions, catalogues and merchandise, over time, Ms. Legnani said, it will become totally self-sufficient.
To lure corporations like Philip Morris to become sponsors, she plans to emphasize the economic impact these events have on Venice, which in turn, she believes, insures high visibility for sponsors. Each year about $3 million is made directly from entrance fees and catalogue sales.
During the height of the Biennale, about $10 million is generated from tourism, spent at hotels, restaurants and retail stores.
Included in the Biennale's plans is a new theater on San Giorgio Island, across the Grand Canal from San Marco, which would hold year-round dance and performing arts programs.
Over the next few years, plans also include keeping the gardens at the tip of Venice -- where the 26 national pavilions are clustered -- open all the time, beginning with a schedule of programs in the Italian pavilion.
"We hope other pavilions will follow," Ms. Legnani said.
 
Not L.A.'s Way
Contrary to speculation, Pace Wildenstein is not closing its Beverly Hills gallery. But it is discontinuing its exhibition program there.
"The gallery is still open and there is art for people to buy," said Arne Glimcher, the chairman of Pace Wildenstein.
It will continue to stock work by the artists it represents, including Agnes Martin, Chuck Close, Kiki Smith and Robert Rauschenberg.
Since Pace Wildenstein opened its Los Angeles branch on Wilshire Boulevard in 1995, the gallery has held more than 50 exhibitions.
"People love to come to the openings, but the Los Angeles life style does not include gallery going, it's simply not part of the culture." Mr. Glimcher said. "We've done very well here, but not from the shows."
The space, designed by the New York architect Charles Gwathmey, never attracted the steady traffic that Pace Wildenstein's two New York galleries do, even though Mr. Glimcher is well connected in Los Angeles. A part-time filmmaker (producer of "Gorillas in the Mist" and director of "Mambo Kings") he knows the many modern and contemporary art collectors who make their money in the movie business.
"There is still an art-buying life in Los Angeles," Mr. Glimcher said. "Just not a gallery-going one. People in Los Angeles prefer to go to the gym."

HEADLINE: DESIGN REVIEW;
Seductive Objects With a Sly Sting

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
With only half a year to go until the millennium arrives, wouldn't it be great to have a worldwide designer yard sale? Out with the Richard Meier plates! Away with the Michael Graves tea kettles! For when the dust has settled from this maniacally industrious chapter in the field of industrial design, only four figures of major artistic stature will be left standing: Ettore Sottsass, Gaetano Pesce, Philippe Starck and Shiro Kuramata. Two Italians, one Frenchman and a gentleman from Japan, the last, alas, no longer living.
This quartet has led us into the epoch of postindustrial design. Their work justifies the expenditure of wood, glass, stone, steel, plastics and other materials toward the service of the present. Everything else is a mistake. 
 Mr. Starck, who moved from Paris to New York earlier this year, is the subject of a small exhibition at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, Queens. The exhibition "Philippe Starck: Furniture and Objects" is among the first fruits of the recent alliance between P.S. 1 and the Museum of Modern Art. The 26 objects on view were collected by David Whitney, the independent curator, and are presented in an installation designed by the architect Philip Johnson. The result is a tribute both to the talent of Mr. Starck and to the evergreen curatorial intelligence of Mr. Whitney and Mr. Johnson.
It has been 65 years since Mr. Johnson mounted "Machine Art," the Museum of Modern Art's first major design show. The objects in the Starck show have been presented as a gift to the Modern's permanent design collection. Mr. Johnson deserves credit not just for sponsoring the roots of the modern design esthetic but also for tracking the evolution of that esthetic into post-modern times. As Marcel Duchamp said, in the future, all the artist can do is point. Mr. Johnson began pointing in the right direction before most of us were born.
Mr. Starck designs under the sign of Scorpio. Visually seductive, usually curvilinear, a Starck design invariably has a sting in its tail. The aluminum legs of the stool Mr. Starck designed for the lobby bar at the Royalton Hotel in Manhattan have the biomorphic voluptuousness of Art Nouveau tendrils. But they touch the floor with barbed points that could pass for giant fishhooks. Media folk angle here.
People in toxic relationships should avoid sharing a Starck-designed bathroom. The designer's sharp-pointed toothbrush appears equally suited for oral hygiene or domestic violence. The Lola Mundo chair, of ebony-stained ashwood with metal legs, is gorgeous, but the screws that attach the metal legs poke through the seat. Is the sitter meant to squirm? Perhaps the chair is a therapeutic device for treating cellulite.
Mr. Starck's work revolves around fear of rejection. His core shape is the horn, an image that figures in many prehistoric drawings. Archeologists regard the horn as a symbol of fertility, a union of the male and female genitals. In the chalk drawings of prehistoric Britain, the horn is brandished as trophy and weapon. The image speaks to the contemporary sensibility that finds extreme bliss and terror in merging with another.
In the last quarter century, Mr. Sottsass, Mr. Pesce, Mr. Kuramata and Mr. Starck have transfigured design. The four have one interest in common. They have all shifted design from the right to the left side of the brain. For Marcel Breuer, Mies van der Rohe and other designers of classic Modernist furniture, the design esthetic was a right-brain affair. Their chairs and tables were rooted in the rational organization dictated by industrial production. It was in their day that the term industrial design was coined.
But in the last 50 years, the economic base has shifted from production to consumption. It has gravitated from the sphere of rationality to the realm of desire: from the objective to the subjective, to the realm of psychology. Mr. Sottsass, Mr. Kuramata, Mr. Pesce and Mr. Starck have applied genius to this cultural shift. Mr. Starck, who was born in 1949, is the youngest of the four, and the only one to break into the mass market with a fair degree of success. His designs fall within the price range of the middle-class buyer. His surrealist sensibility is available to all who can afford to dream.
The exhibition is presented in a beautiful space that P.S. 1 calls the Kunsthalle. Natural light pours in from two sides. The high ceilings are vaulted with brick. Mr. Johnson has designed a simple enfilade down the center of the space, arranging Mr. Starck's objects on white wooden platforms of varying height and width. At the far end of the gallery, a panel displays a large photo of a toothpick designed by Mr. Starck. The picture conveys the grace of a Brancusi sculpture and the menace of a dental appliance. Pleasure and pain, still together after all these years.
In the last decade, Mr. Starck has created the most important contemporary public spaces in New York: his interiors for the Paramount and Royalton hotels. By rights, his relocation to New York should have been saluted with a major show at the Museum of Modern Art. But I prefer to think of the exhibition at P.S. 1 as a vote of confidence in the future of the outer boroughs. I suspect that in the years ahead the most innovative work in architecture, design and urbanism will flourish on the edges of New York.
 
"Philippe Starck: Furniture and Objects" remains at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, through Aug. 29.

HEADLINE: Panel Sees No Short Cut To a Less Violent Media

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
The topic before a packed auditorium at the New School in Greenwich Village was "Violence in America: Reel Life vs. Real Life."
But the discussion Wednesday evening by a panel of seven mostly arts-oriented writers, lawyers and creative types was more First Amendment versus Second Amendment, with a clear bias in favor of curbing guns rather than free speech. 
 The forum, sponsored by the Creative Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group representing members of the arts and entertainment sector, was a reflection of the growing unease about violence in the media since the killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. But if the gathering revealed anything, it might have been that it is much easier to express anxiety about violence in the media than reach a consensus on what to do.
"Traveling around the country, you get the clear sense that parents are upset and confused and that people who have been apathetic are beginning to become vocal," said John Fund, an editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal who described himself as the panel's token conservative. "Maybe it doesn't go any further than that. But I think a conversation is definitely starting."
The conversation on Wednesday was a somewhat chaotic one that veered from guns to V-chips to one audience member's question about whether it was an immoral act to be a guest on the Bob Grant or Don Imus radio shows.
The other panelists were the actor, producer and director Stanley Tucci; the television producer Linda Ellerbee; Deborah A. Forte, executive vice president of Scholastic Entertainment; the director and writer Peter Bogdanovich; Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School, and the lawyer Martin Garbus.
Dr. Poussaint said there was "overwhelming evidence" that violence in the media had real-world reverberations.
"Like air pollution, it affects the most vulnerable part of society -- it's like asthma," he said. The problem, he said, is the "lethal mix" of guns, violence, other social ills and a society drenched in violent media.
But Mr. Garbus and others said that there was no way to censor violence in the media except through self-censorship by people in news and entertainment.
Much of the conversation turned to curbing guns rather than curbing violence in the media, with several of the panel members, particularly Mr. Garbus and Mr. Bogdanovich, questioning the practicality in today's world of the Second Amendment's protection of private ownership of firearms.
Amid the gun sparring, there were condemnations of the degree to which violence has become an accepted part of the entertainment mix. Mr. Tucci lamented the disparity in resources between the small, personal films he tries to make and the shoot-'em-up blockbusters that open on thousands of multiplex screens each week.
Mr. Bogdanovich compared the megatonnage of violence in modern films with the understated use of it in the Fritz Lang film "M," in which Peter Lorre plays a child murderer. He said that the 1931 film, with its off-screen violence and chilling, dramatic staging (a child's ball rolling out from behind a bush, a balloon flying into the air), was far more powerful and effective than the explicitly bloody movies of today.
Still, as the actor William Baldwin, one of the co-hosts of the gathering, pointed out, it will be hard to change the situation as long as there is an economic incentive for violence-drenched blockbusters.
"It's called show business, and the operative word is business," said Mr. Baldwin, president of the Creative Coalition.
Even given American society's short attention span, Dr. Poussaint said, there is something striking about the current mood.
"The difference between Columbine and other events is that it's about white suburban kids," he said. "We have 21,000 homicides a year in this country, but this time we can't say it's ghetto kids, it's poor kids, it's single-parent households. We can't explain it away in the usual ways."

Adding Affordable 3-Family Homes to Bedford-Stuyvesant Mix

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
By the middle of the month, two mostly vacant blocks in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn will begin to fill with a housing type so far absent from the neighborhood's revival: 45 three-family homes for people with annual incomes of $30,000 to $70,000.
The houses, with a total of 135 units, will rise on the blocks off Saratoga Avenue between Sumpter and Fulton Streets, near the Broadway commercial corridor in the Saratoga urban renewal area. Since 1996, the area, generally bounded by Bainbridge and Fulton Streets and Rockaway and Ralph Avenues, has been the focus of publicly assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families, with 238 two-family residences completed and 459 houses, mostly two-family, under way or planned. 
 The $15 million three-family home project, E. I. Key Maple Gardens at Saratoga Square, brings a higher-density project to the area. At each of the houses, the owner gets one apartment and rents out the others to help pay the monthly mortgage. The development is named in part for Eula Irene Key, a community advocate.
Three-family homes have been successful in the Bronx and in other parts of Brooklyn since they were included in 1993 as part of the city's New Homes program, which provides subsidies to keep homes affordable. But they have been slow to take hold in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
L & M Equity Participants Ltd. of Larchmont, N.Y., which developed five three-family home projects in the Bronx, was willing to test the concept in Bedford-Stuyvesant with Maple Gardens. The company, whose principals are Sanford Loewentheil and Ronald Moelis, is developing the project with Loewen Development of New Rochelle, N.Y. The Chase Community Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank, is providing a $9 million construction loan.
Mr. Loewentheil said the partners were betting that they could repeat their success in the Bronx with Maple Gardens. "To insure the marketability of the Bronx houses, we included 900- to 1,000-square-foot basements, and dressed them up architecturally to entice buyers," he said, adding that those elements would be in the Brooklyn homes.
The homes, designed by Danois Architects of Manhattan, will have brown brick facades with a limestone base and feature bay windows, recalling details found in the neighborhood's brownstones. They will also have front and rear yards, a one-car driveway and a duplex apartment and two single-level units.
The 1,500-square-foot duplex, on the first floor and half of the second, will have three bedrooms and a 900-square-foot basement for the owner. A 500-square-foot one-bedroom rental completes the second floor, and a 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom unit will occupy the third floor. Rents are expected to be $500 to $900 a month.
The project is part of the city's New Homes program, whose sponsors include the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the nonprofit New York City Housing Partnership. The city and the state each provided a subsidy per house of $30,000 and $37,500 respectively. But to make the project work, the offices of the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, and City Councilwoman Tracy L. Boyland, each added $9,000. The total subsidy -- $85,500 for each house -- lowers the sale price to $238,000.
"The three-family home is a good model in certain areas of Brooklyn," said Greg Brooks, Mr. Golden's chief of staff, noting that it allowed "more people of moderate means to rent as well as a wider income band of interested purchasers to buy."
Of the 127 three-family homes built elsewhere in Brooklyn under the city's New Homes program, 107 make up the Village at Atlantic Center. It is the housing component, ultimately to include 32 more such homes, of the mixed-used Atlantic Center project being developed near the Long Island Rail Road terminal in the Fort Greene section.
Because it is "more difficult to develop in the Saratoga area, we wanted to test the market," Mr. Brooks said. "The homes built proved to be successful, so we are looking at other housing models, like three-family houses."
One advantage of the three-family houses, said Veronica M. White, president of the Housing Partnership, is that "they enable us to provide more houses on the same plot of land." From a planning perspective, three-family homes work in areas where transportation and shopping are available, Ms. White said, noting that Maple Gardens was near a new 20,000-square-foot retail center at Fulton Street and Ralph Avenue.
But they are more expensive to develop, she said, and added that "we were able to leap from two- to three-family homes in the Saratoga area because the state, city, borough and City Council came together to provide the subsidies." The hope is to do more, she said, pointing out that four other three-family-home projects, totaling more than 300 units, were planned in Brooklyn.
Other factors in keeping Maple Gardens affordable, Mr. Loewentheil said, are that the project received a tax abatement from the city that will keep taxes low for 20 years, and fixed-rate mortgages with 5 percent down payments will be offered through Chase. The Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, also underwrites the mortgages to allow buyers to count 60 percent of the rental income toward their monthly mortgage payments.
The developer will provide a $5,000 rebate to help buyers with closing costs, and Chase will provide $6,000, Mr. Loewentheil said, so that buyers then will need $11,900 for a down payment. He estimates that the monthly cost to own the home will be about $1,900, which with the apartment rents, totaling about $1,400, could be cut to $500.
Orville G. Brathwaite, director of Neighborhood Housing Services of Bedford-Stuyvesant and the community sponsor for Maple Gardens, said, "It's the area's first three-family home project, but we're thinking it's the way we need to go in new construction."
Mr. Loewentheil said sales of the homes would begin when construction started in mid-July, with completion to follow 18 months later. He said the partners intended to start work next year on a second three-family home project, with 40 houses, in Crown Heights in Brooklyn.

A Bad Year for the World's Border Guards

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
Among its other casualties, the war in Kosovo punctured the sanctity of state sovereignty -- the idea that a nation's actions within its borders are its own business. This concept has organized international relations since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. That year, as Europe's religious empires crumbled, the Continent's powerful states agreed to respect each other's sovereignty, founding the modern state system. That has now been eroding for 50 years, but the events of the past year have been a blow like no other, and one that should be welcomed. 
 Sovereignty's worst day in memory was undoubtedly March 24. NATO began bombing Serbia, probably the first multinational attack designed primarily to stop violations of international law within a country's borders. The same day, England's high court ruled that London could send Augusto Pinochet to Spain to be tried for crimes in Chile, as both European countries had signed an international convention promising to prosecute torturers, no matter where their crimes took place.
Then on May 27, the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia announced a warrant for the arrest of Slobodan Milosevic. It was the first indictment of a sitting head of state for violations of international law. A year ago, 120 nations, not including the United States, signed a treaty establishing an international criminal court, in which international law trumps national sovereignty.
While sovereignty has been fading since the end of World War II, until recently governments have in general ceded powers voluntarily. European nations have voted their way into defense, political and monetary unions. Globalization has been bringing down economic borders, but whether to open up has been a nation's choice, although one influenced by substantial economic pressure. Peacekeepers and election observers are found around the world, but they do not arrive without the blessing of their hosts.
This year's attacks on sovereignty had widespread approval, but not from Mr. Milosevic or Mr. Pinochet. That is a shift toward respecting a nation's sovereignty only when it respects the rights of its people as international law defines them.
That idea has been growing since the end of World War II. The Nuremberg tribunal introduced the concept that leaders' treatment of their own people was subject to international prosecution. The United Nations -- organized around sovereignty -- also created one of the most important tools for the assault on sovereignty today, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Nations also signed the Geneva Conventions and a treaty promising to punish genocide carried out anywhere in the world. These laws were never enforced because cold-war politics intervened.
Now there are the first stirrings of enforcement. Mr. Pinochet's Government had signed the Torture Convention that nabbed him. The international criminal court will apply laws endorsed by nearly every country. The war crimes tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda were established by the United Nations and have been fair. The Yugoslav tribunal has prosecuted Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
NATO's bombing of Serbia was based on the same principle -- enforcing respect for international law. But many people all over the world did not perceive it that way. Because the bombing was not done under U.N. auspices, theories abounded that Washington was really trying to establish hegemony in the Balkans or assure the flow of Caspian basin oil.
The war did not get U.N. Security Council approval because Russia and China called NATO's motives not universal, but political. The brief period of world consensus on the limits of sovereignty is closing precisely because the notion has come far enough to scare many nations. Russia worries it will be criticized or even invaded for its abuses in Chechnya, and China has the same defensiveness over its behavior in Tibet.
The bombing of Serbia was indeed based on political considerations. Yugoslavia is in Europe, the abuses were on CNN, and it is a weak country where quick and effective intervention seemed likely. That this human rights crisis was chosen for intervention over others, however, does not make the intervention less necessary or legitimate. The weight of political considerations, moreover, shows why Russia and China need not fear similar treatment.
Absolute respect for sovereignty, of course, was even more political than the challenge to it posed today. The remarkable development is that some of the actions of the past year have managed to rise above politics. Power politics will always rule international affairs. But the last 50 years have seen the rise of universally endorsed principles of conduct. The extent to which the world chooses to respect them, even when they conflict with sovereignty, is a good measure of civilization's progress.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Saving Public Colleges

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
For weeks, I have had the most important report on the most important university in the life and future of New York City. But I did not read it. I just glared at it.
The cover put me off, hard -- "The City University of New York: An Institution Adrift." Another attack on the publicly financed college that led me to work I have loved ever since? Who needs it? 
 My City College was an intellectually and academically elite school attended by students with family income ranging from not much to very not much. Eventually it was grouped legislatively with 16 other senior and community colleges into the City University of New York -- which now carries the hopes of the 200,000 students who attend it.
I knew CUNY has had deep faults and problems since it opened the doors to all high school graduates in 1969. Academically it has all the cachet of a herring.
I also knew that the color palette of the student body has changed from almost entirely white to 72 percent other shades. For most of their families, CUNY was the first college, and blessed.
I resented the nastiness of the criticism of CUNY, like Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's advice to the students to learn how to work. Try working for food, clothes, carfare at night while working for graduation credits by day. You just won't have the energy left for polo.
When I did read the report after a few weeks, the glare disappeared. This is a report written under the leadership of Herman Badillo, recently appointed chairman of CUNY by the Mayor, and Benno Schmidt Jr., former president of Yale.
My eyes softened when I realized the goal was not to eliminate CUNY or shrink it -- as some students and teachers fear -- but to restore some of its academic glisten, so graduates would again help lead the city and profit from its economic growth.
For me, the most valuable qualities of the report were three varieties of respect. Perhaps the most important: the tone of belief in what students could do for themselves and the city if CUNY gave them the dignity of higher goals of achievements, not the sub-college standards that are good enough now.
Second, the respect of pledging "absolute commitment" to CUNY's "historic organizational mission" to provide first-rate college opportunities for all New Yorkers academically able to take advantage of them.
Third: proposals to help those not ready because of the failure of New York's elementary and high school system to teach so many students more than a humiliatingly low level of writing, reading and arithmetic.
The most important step is the first step: to establish and help students reach acceptable goals not only in college but before they enter it.
Almost all American colleges provide remedial courses. But CUNY's load and the lack of standards of remedial achievement for the college bound drag down CUNY with too many students unqualified for higher education. The report proposes that remedial classes be held not in the four-year senior colleges but in the community colleges, and that passing them must be the requirement for senior colleges -- with national standard entry tests to come.
The way things are in New York, the elementary and high school system often prepares students for failure in college. The report proposes widening the emergency remedy now in some schools: CUNY teachers using summers and other free time for tutorials in reading, writing and mathematics in high schools and the late grades of elementary schools.
That will cost money -- about $10 million -- and so will other proposals. The end of "social promotion" in elementary schools, a cockamamie, basically political idea, shoves all students on to the next grade, ready or not. Technological unification for planning throughout CUNY, a kind of remediation for management.
Writing an important report is difficult; getting the money out of politicians for achievement, not stagnation, that's really hard.
They must remember that when CUNY opened its doors wide in 1969, it did not switch its goals from achievement to mediocrity and failure. Open enrollment has worked out for those who had qualifications, not for those who did not. This report is not an attack on public higher education, but the opposite -- an effort to improve and protect it.

Rangers Fly Off for the Free-Agent Frenzy

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Neil Smith and Dave Checketts began their jet-propelled shopping spree yesterday, seeking free agents to bolster the Rangers' roster. They took the company plane to Winnipeg to negotiate with Don Baizley, the agent for right wing Theo Fleury. Their next stop was suburban Los Angeles to talk to Pat Brisson, the agent for defenseman Stephane Quintal. They were considering another touchdown in California to see Jeff Solomon, the agent for center Bob Corkum.
Smith, the president and general manager of the Rangers, and Checketts, his boss as the president of Madison Square Garden, could accelerate the salary inflation in the National Hockey League through their checkbook roster-building. But that is not their major concern. For the past two seasons, the Garden has been dark for the hockey playoffs, when many teams make their most money. Smith and Checketts need a quick fix of talent to restart that revenue stream. 
 "They cannot permit themselves to miss the playoffs three years in a row," Brisson said from his office in Santa Monica, Calif., as he awaited their arrival.
Unlike Fleury and most other top-name free agents, Quintal, Brisson's client, is not a Group 3 player who is over age 31 with an expired contract. He is only 30 but is free because his contract ended with him making less than the league average salary after 10 seasons as a profession. Quintal earned $900,000 last season with Montreal, about $400,000 below the league average. His category is Group 5.
Fleury ended the season in Colorado, and Corkum played for Phoenix.
Brisson said that several teams -- among them Toronto -- called him yesterday as the free-agent season officially opened. Although Brisson would not be specific about Quintal's salary requests, he said that $15 million over five seasons might be "in the ball park." He added that Quintal could enjoy playing in New York.
"The Rangers would definitely be a team he is interested in," Brisson said. "They are looking for someone to replace Jeff Beukeboom." A veteran defenseman, Beukeboom suffered post-concussion syndrome last season and his future is in doubt.
Quintal is a right-handed shooter who plays the right side. As such, he might make a logical partner for Brian Leetch, the team captain, a left-handed shooter who plays the left side.
N.H.L. salaries have increased substantially in the 1990's, as has the size of the league. There were 21 clubs in 1991; there will be 28 next season and 30 in 2000-1. The average salary in 1993-94 was $558,000. That autumn, the N.H.L. commissioner, Gary Bettman, ordered a lockout that lasted 15 weeks to get a collective bargaining agreement with terms intended to hold down the rate of salary growth. Last season, the average salary was about $1.3 million. The collective bargaining agreement has been extended until the summer of 2004.
Although the union made several major concessions to end the lockout, the players and their agents seemed satisfied with the one major tradeoff in their favor: the freedom for veterans like Fleury to move without restriction. Fleury is expected to request a contract paying him between $8 million and $10 million a season for several years. Paul Kariya of Anaheim, a left wing who was a restricted Group 2 free agent, agreed to a three-year contract this week that is expected to pay him about $10 million a season.
Since the new collective bargaining agreement, the Rangers have had mixed success with free agents. Their major acquisitions were Wayne Gretzky, Mike Keane and Brian Skrudland. Gretzky played three seasons, with diminishing returns, at high salary -- $6 million last season. Keane and Skrudland were traded to Dallas after less than a full season. However, the Rangers have had success in signing their own free agents who could have left. Leetch and Adam Graves signed before the July 1 deadline; Mike Richter returned last season after signing last summer.
 
SLAP SHOTS
JIM DEMARIA, a spokesman for the Chicago Blackhawks, expressed skepticism yesterday about published reports that his team would trade DOUG GILMOUR, the veteran center, to the Rangers. DeMaria said team management was happy with Gilmour, signed last summer as a free agent, and was not shopping him.

HEADLINE: Randolph Guggenheimer, 91; Saved Hospital

BYLINE: By ENID NEMY 

 BODY:
Randolph Guggenheimer, a Manhattan lawyer who helped spearhead the development of a community hospital serving the residents of Harlem, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.
When the Hospital for Joint Diseases moved from Madison Avenue and 124th Street in 1979, Mr. Guggenheimer and Eugene L. McCabe, a management consultant, worked together to insure that hospital services would continue in the old building, which was renamed North General Hospital. 
 Mr. Guggenheimer had been a board member of the Hospital for Joint Diseases, but he opposed the decision to move because he believed very strongly that Harlem needed a hospital. "I thought, 'I'm a New Yorker, I was born in New York, I love the city, and there is nothing there but Harlem Hospital, which is insufficient,' " he said.
Financial crises threatened North General's existence several times, and at one early point, the National Health and Human Services Employees Union asked its members to continue working despite a missed pay period. Mr. McCabe and Mr. Guggenheimer recruited public officials, philanthropists, bankers, leaders of major medical institutions and local businessmen to take care of the foundering hospital's unpaid bills and to raise both money and standards.
Both Mr. Guggenheimer, who served as the hospital's only trustee for a time, and Mr. McCabe were tireless in pursuing funds, and helped to engineer a New York State bond issue of $150 million for a new building that would serve the impoverished and medically deprived area. At the time, many small community hospitals, overwhelmed with the unexpected demands of AIDS patients and crack addicts, were being closed.
"It didn't make financial sense," said Mario M. Cuomo, who as Governor of New York approved many of the grants and loans to build North General. Mr. Cuomo described the hospital's creation as "a miracle."
The state called the rebuilding of the hospital "the largest public-private construction project in the history of Harlem." In 1991, the new 200-bed North General, the only minority-operated hospital in the state, opened its doors at Madison Avenue between 121st and 122d Streets. The nonprofit hospital specializes in treatment for diabetes, cancer and hypertension.
Several years later, the institution added 300 units of condominium housing for low- and middle-income residents of Harlem.
Both Mr. Guggenheimer and Mr. McCabe took pride in the fact that the new building was completed for some $15 million less than the amount of their state bond financing.
"When we called up the state and asked what we should do with the surplus money, they didn't know what to say," Mr. Guggenheimer once recalled. "It had never happened before. They finally told us to keep it to avoid complications." The money was used to build an annex.
Mr. McCabe was president of the hospital and Mr. Guggenheimer was board chairman, a position he held for some years. He maintained an office in the hospital until his death. An annual award in his name was established by the trustees in 1998, to be given to a member of the hospital staff for excellence in community service. Mr. Guggenheimer received the United Hospital Annual Distinguished Trustee of the Year award and, in 1991, was honored by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Mr. McCabe died of cancer at the age of 61 in September 1998,
In his dedication to Harlem, Mr. Guggenheimer followed the example of his mother, Minna Schafer Guggenheimer, who from 1918 to 1964 produced the annual summer concerts at Lewisohn Stadium on the City College campus. The concert series was a diamond in the New York cultural scene for years, bringing major performers to the neighborhood at admission fees of less than a dollar. Lewisohn Stadium was torn down in 1966, two years after Mrs. Guggenheimer's death.
Randolph Guggenheimer was born in Manhattan on Nov. 14, 1907. His father, Charles S. Guggenheimer, was a partner in Guggenheimer & Untermyer, a law firm his own father had founded.
Minna Guggenheimer, a philanthropist known to New Yorkers as Minnie, raised money, engaged artists and handled negotiations for the stadium concerts. She attended most of them, and was famous for her informality and completely uninhibited intermission speeches. On one occasion, a royal guest got lost and wandered into the wings as he was about to be introduced. Mrs. Guggenheimer chased after him, yelling, "Here, Prince! Here, Prince!"
Mr. Guggenheimer was educated at the Morristown Preparatory Academy in New Jersey and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1928. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1931, joined the family law firm and later became a partner. In 1932 he married the former Elinor Coleman. She has been a member of the City Planning Commission and Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, and was a founder of several national and international women's organizations.
Mr. Guggenheimer enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1942 and served as executive officer of a fighter squadron in Europe during World War II.
Through the years, he was active in a number of organizations, including the Jewish Child Care Association and the Mount Sinai Hospital School of Nursing.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Charles and Randolph Jr., and a sister, Sophie Untermeyer, all of Manhattan, three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Albany's Vacation From Inaction

 BODY:
New York's state government has taken gridlock to a new level. Budgets in Albany used to be delayed until some other critical deadline forced an agreement. But now even those triggers are not enough to make things work. On Wednesday night, cuts in the state Medicaid program lapsed, sticking the state and localities with tens of millions of dollars in unexpected bills. Protections for New York City loft tenants expired, terrifying many long-term residents with limited incomes. But nothing happened. The Legislature went away for a vacation and a "cooling off" period. 
 Although Gov. George Pataki's staff sometimes jokes that the state would save money running on emergency appropriations forever, these delays are unsupportable. In New York City, the schools are playing a dangerous but unavoidable game by presuming that money for new prekindergarten programs and reduced-size classes in September will eventually be approved, and risking financial catastrophe if it is not. Other school districts are trying to prepare their tax bills in a void.
Lately, the Legislature and Mr. Pataki seemed to have reached the point that a more functional government would have got to in early spring. A final budget agreement seemed near, perhaps in time to break the logjam and pass other critical time-sensitive legislation. But talks collapsed over the issue of Medicaid. The Legislature had approved rather stiff cuts in the state's reimbursement program to hospitals and nursing homes in 1995, and Mr. Pataki had proposed new economies this year. The state's largest hospital workers' union, led by Dennis Rivera, has been running harsh ads against Mr. Pataki, portraying him as an enemy of the old and the disabled.
The state should not be making a new assault on the health care system at a time when New York's hospitals are already under siege by the Federal Government and H.M.O.'s. Mr. Pataki may have already given up on his new cost-cutting agenda. But if he has not, he should do so quickly. The Democratic Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, is pressing for an end to the old cuts as well. He should not try to turn back the clock. Controlling Medicaid costs has always been important in a state where the bill for treating the health care needs of the poor is enormous and ever-expanding.
But if it takes some reasonable concessions to get a budget deal done, Mr. Pataki should compromise as a gesture of good will. Right now the old cuts have expired anyway, pleasing the hospitals but burdening the state with $82 million in unexpected costs over the next three months alone. Local governments will have to pay about $50 million extra. The meter is running.
Stopping the pay of state legislators when they fail to pass a budget on time does not seem to have worked. They have not got their salaries since April, but most of them seem more cranky than cowed. Mr. Pataki, whose bad relationship with Mr. Silver is central to the impasse, still gets his salary. But he should perhaps be barred from making any more out-of-state speaking trips to brag about New York's fiscal achievements until the state has a functioning budget.

HEADLINE: Report Says U.S. Manufacturing Is GrowingWith No End in Sight

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The United States manufacturing sector grew in June for the fifth consecutive month, and a rising backlog of orders at factories indicates that growth should continue, according to a survey of executives released yesterday.
The National Association of Purchasing Management, which represents executives who buy raw materials and supplies for manufacturers, said 16 of 20 industries had reported increases in business. 
 "Both production and new orders exhibited significant growth when compared to May," said Norbert J. Ore, head of the trade group's survey committee.
The purchasing managers' report is closely watched because it gives economists, including Federal Reserve officials, the first reading on how the manufacturing sector and in turn the overall economy fared in the previous month.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that construction spending, one of the economy's strongest sectors, fell in May for a second consecutive month. Construction is slowing in part because mortgage rates have been rising.
The report said construction spending dropped nine-tenths of a percent in May after falling 2 percent in April. Decreases were reported in single-family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and motels as well as in big government construction projects, it said.
The purchasing managers said their monthly index of business activity rose to 57 percent in June from 55.2 percent in May. It was a much stronger showing than the 54.4 percent that analysts had expected.
A reading above 50 percent in the index indicates that the manufacturing economy is expanding. The index has been climbing since a prolonged downturn ended in February.
The group said its separate price index reached 53.5 percent in June, above the 50 percent mark for the second consecutive month and indicating that the costs of raw materials continue to increase. The index rose to 52.2 percent in May, the first time since December 1997 that manufacturers indicated they were paying higher prices for raw materials.
A majority of those surveyed said new orders were stronger or remained at May levels, while 13 percent said they were lower.
Just 16 percent reported a reduced backlog of orders.
Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the purchasing report signaled that "there's still a very healthy economy" and "without any real problems in the pipeline."

HEADLINE: Approval for Nominee to Top Treasury Post

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Lawrence Summers won Senate approval today to become Treasury Secretary, promising to follow the economic course set by Robert E. Rubin.
The Senate voted 97 to 2 in favor of Mr. Summers, President Clinton's choice to replace Mr. Rubin. The vote clears the way for Mr. Summers to take over after four years as Mr. Rubin's deputy. 
 Mr. Rubin could step down as early as Friday.
During the confirmation process, Mr. Summers won overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats by promising to carry on Mr. Rubin's pro-market and strong-dollar policies.
But lawmakers say Mr. Summers, a 44-year-old former Harvard University professor, has his work cut out for him.
The world's second-largest economy, Japan, is struggling to recover from recession, and growth in Europe is sluggish.
At home, Mr. Summers faces wrangling over Mr. Clinton's tax and trade policies, and Mr. Summers's role in International Monetary Fund bailouts for Russia and other nations caught up in global financial turmoil.
Two Republicans, Wayne Allard of Colorado and Robert Smith of New Hampshire, voted against Mr. Summers.
But opposition melted away for fear that foot-dragging by Congress would unnerve financial markets.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: KOSOVO NOTEBOOK;
Milosevic's Vision of Glory Unleashed Decade of Ruin

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: KOSOVO POLJE, Kosovo, June 25

 BODY:
On the eve of the NATO bombing of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic turned to the American envoys facing him. "You are a superpower," he said. "You can do what you want. If you want to say Sunday is Wednesday, you can. It is all up to you."
Christopher Hill, one of the officials present, was struck by the words because they seemed to capture the fatalism of the Yugoslav President as he led his people to the abyss. "It was a form of the old Serbian megalomania," Mr. Hill, the American Ambassador to Macedonia, observed, "the one that says you can destroy us, but we will be right." 
 Three months and tens of thousands of NATO sorties later, that destruction is evident in this ragged central Kosovo town where the bleary Serbian faces speak of a sea change in the Balkan equation: A decade after Mr. Milosevic envisioned it here in a speech that whipped up Serbian nationalism and helped cement his power, Greater Serbia is dead.
In its place, a new group of largely ethnically homogeneous states has emerged, with the help of Mr. Milosevic's consistent brutality from Vukovar in Croatia through the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, to Kosovo towns like Djakovica and Pec.
Mr. Milosevic has been the midwife of his enemies' ascendancy. His tactics of mass killing and eviction of civilians have helped forge a separate Croatia, a new Bosnian Muslim identity and now an embryonic Albanian nation state in Kosovo. Serbia, meanwhile, one of the first Balkan nation states to emerge in the 19th century, is still casting around for stable borders, unable to resolve the dilemma of how to unite Serbs in one country now that the old Yugoslavia is dead.
Greater Serbia -- a land that would incorporate traditional Serb-populated swaths of Croatia and Bosnia -- was Mr. Milosevic's answer to that problem. Now, the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo and the Balkans as a whole has prompted concern in the West. A Greater Albania -- embracing Albania, Kosovo and the western part of Macedonia whose population is heavily Albanian -- is the avowed goal of some Kosovo Liberation Army fighters.
"We spent the 1990's worrying about a Greater Serbia," Mr. Hill said. "That's finished. We are going to spend time well into the next century worrying about a Greater Albania."
Of course, Greater Serbia was always a project pursued with ruthless violence. There is no evidence that Albania has similar will or might. But the buoyant ascendancy of the Kosovo Liberation Army is unmistakable, and some of the weapons it wields come from the military arsenals of Albania that were looted during the country's descent into economic mayhem in spring 1997.
Unlike Bosnia, Kosovo has no model of a multiethnic state, and Pristina has none of the cultural openness that marked Sarajevo. The remnants of peaceful coexistence here were snuffed out in the last two decades; first, the Albanian majority wielded power, then Mr. Milosevic stripped away that autonomy, and his police ruled Kosovo harshly for the last decade. This history will complicate and continually undermine one of NATO's aims in Kosovo: to allow Serbs and Albanians to live together in peace.
In some ways, the Albanian question is the Serbian question in a broken mirror. Like the Serbs, the Albanians are a people scattered in several countries, harboring a deep sense of historical injustice, marked by a pattern of disunity, still in search of stable contours for their nation and stable institutions to govern it.
Throughout Kosovo, the Albanians' flag flutters on smashed factories and city halls, hoisted there by the young men of the K.L.A. From time to time, NATO patrols pass beneath the flags.
Such scenes could scarcely be more fantastically remote from the nationalist vision offered by Mr. Milosevic a decade ago when he came to Kosovo's Field of Blackbirds -- scene of a Serbian defeat by the Turks in 1389 -- to proclaim a glorious Serbian future, one in which the Serbs -- no longer "humiliated" -- would do battle for their "state, national and spiritual integrity."
The battle has been lost. Defeat is now real, bitter as ash. "Milosevic has used us and betrayed us," said Radovan Delibasic, a Serb from Kosovo Polje. "He came here 10 years ago to inspire us with our history in Kosovo. But we have learned that you cannot live from history. Americans have no history and they live wonderfully well."
 
Homecoming
For One Couple, All Hopes Dashed
 Pec was once a beautiful town, threaded by bright streams, backed by mountains. Like Mostar in Bosnia, and all that was most lovely in the Balkans, it expressed the delicate interweaving of Islamic and Christian architecture and traditions that was the legacy of the Ottoman Empire.
No more. Pec is gone, another Balkan bridge between East and West devoured in one of those paroxysms of destruction that have made charred, shattered ruins the most pervasive symbol of Yugoslavia's demise.
Gjevdt Zajmi and his wife, Ganimete, trudge home, past abandoned gardens with trees full of unpicked cherries, capsized trellises with vines still clinging to them, dead animals and the blackened windows that are the baleful eyes of so much Balkan ruin.
Kosovo Albanians, the Zajmis were driven out on March 28, four days after the NATO bombardment began, by three Serbian paramilitary thugs in black masks. The same old story: from Prijedor in northwestern Bosnia to Prizren in southwestern Kosovo, "ethnic cleansing" has few nuances.
A painful odyssey through a mountain village, Montenegro and finally Albania ensued, before this return. "We know everything has gone from the house, but we hope the house is still there," Mr. Zajmi says.
As they turn into their street, however, hope evaporates. Ganimete Zajmi takes in the scene and says simply: "Vukovar."
The death of Yugoslavia has now been sufficiently drawn-out for certain acts, like the Serbian obliteration of the mixed Croatian town of Vukovar in 1991, to pass into popular lore. Mrs. Zajmi is right: The ruin is as unmitigated as in the town on the Danube.
The house was built 30 years ago. The couple's three children were raised in it. The family planted the cherry tree that shades the area behind what was the kitchen. Shared memories, a life, really, lie in pieces in the rubble, and the thought of all this abruptly causes the couple to break down in sobs.
"The Serbs were killing before," Mr. Zajmi, a mild man who worked in an engineering plant, said. "But when NATO came, they went wild, screaming that we all had to leave. Only independence is possible now. Nothing else."
Walking back toward the center of town, they encounter a friend, Alma Dreshaj. She is one of few ethnic Albanians to have remained in Pec throughout the NATO bombing, protected, as she explains, by a kind Serb neighbor, Slavo Dedovic.
Two men pass and overhear her words. They turn on her in rage. "There are no good Serbs," one screams. "How can you say such a thing? They send our children to have their throats cut, and you talk of a good Serb." He seems on the verge of striking Ms. Dreshaj, but is restrained by the other man.
As the time for negotiation ran out last March and Mr. Hill explained that NATO would begin bombing, Mr. Milosevic shot back at him: "Anyone who does that -- bomb -- is going to spend the rest of his life on a psychiatric couch."
Once again, Mr. Hill found the words extraordinary, coming from a man who has appeared so consistently destructive.
The symbolism was apparently more important than the substance. Just as the Serbs were ready to go to war in 1914 for the principle that no Austro-Hungarian police be allowed onto their territory to investigate the murder in Sarajevo of the Hapsburg heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand, so they would fight -- even suicidally -- to stop a NATO deployment.
During the bombing, the Serbian leader tried every ploy to stop the bombardment -- making mischief with the Russians, co-opting the mild-mannered Albanian intellectual Ibrahim Rugova, destabilizing Macedonia, dividing the allies by playing on Serbian sympathies in Greece and Italy.
But he also did the one thing -- the brutal eviction and killing of Albanians -- that kept Western public opinion solidly behind the 78-day bombing and cemented the alliance.
"It is a real question whether, in the absence of the ethnic cleansing, NATO would have been able to keep it up after a couple of weeks," a Western official said. "In a sense, his brutality saved the alliance."
It was a serious misjudgment by Mr. Milosevic, one that led directly to the Western protectorate that masks and in some ways promotes the provisional Albanian government by the K.L.A. in Kosovo today, and also, perhaps, could lead to his downfall.
Those who have seen Mr. Milosevic recently -- including Mr. Hill; Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the commander of NATO forces in Europe, and the Swedish financier Peter Castenfelt -- have found him extraordinarily out of touch, surrounded by mediocre aides, living in a world of complete unreality.
"Milosevic kept saying to me, 'We just need seven days to wipe out the Kosovo Liberation Army,' " said General Clark. "He absolutely failed to see that this kind of movement does not work that way."
Before the war, Mr. Hill informed the Yugoslav President of Serbian atrocities he had observed in the Kosovo town of Malisevo, including paramilitary forces systematically burning Albanian homes and stores.
Mr. Milosevic looked upset. He stood up, put his hands in his pockets and started pacing. Mr. Hill recalls him saying: "There is no excuse for that, even if the Serbs in Kosovo are very angry. I accept responsibility. One of the most important tasks of a democracy is to protect its minorities."
This sort of discourse has been part of Mr. Milosevic's rule for 12 years. For in the end, his survival can be explained only by his extraordinary ability to convince many Serbs that they are victims, that others are to blame for all that has befallen them.
But the reality of Yugoslavia's breakup and Mr. Milosevic's legacy is today a hard one: While Slovenia, Croatia and probably now Kosovo have carved ethnic states out of the ruins, the land of the Serbs continues to shrink. On the Field of Blackbirds, a French parachute regiment has deployed, but most Serbs are too poor, isolated and misinformed to care.
 
The Serbs
Another Migration May Fuel a Myth
Hundreds of Serbs now huddle at the Patriarchate of Pec, the old Serbian church with frescoes that speak of the great flowering of medieval Serbian civilization.
Their cars are lined up, ready to leave for good if and when Italian NATO forces in Pec are ready to escort them out.
"We have been here for 700 years, and now NATO bombs and the Albanians have driven us out," said Dragutin Martinovic, the director of a factory. And what of the rampage against Albanians' homes? "All the homes were destroyed by NATO bombs," Mr. Martinovic said. "We did nothing."
There is a terrible sadness in the sight of all these Serbs slumped over old stones on the grounds of their church, their bundles beside them, awaiting some new migration in the long Serbian history of migrations.
More than 300 years ago, in 1689, Patriarch Arsenije led tens of thousands of Serbs north and west from Pec to escape the Turks in a flight that has become part of Serbian myth.
The themes of such myth remain unchanged -- long suffering, heroic isolation, irrational valor, victories in defeat. Perhaps the Kosovo debacle will now be added to the panoply of heroism and suffering.
But unchanged, too, it seems, after 12 years of Mr. Milosevic's rule, is the inability to make these myths coincide with a reality that is stable rather than one that is merely destructive and self-destructive because it exists principally to preserve Mr. Milosevic's power.
When Mr. Milosevic came to Kosovo a decade ago and spoke to hundreds of thousands of Serbs gathered in a celebration of rediscovered post-Communist identity, his inspiration was a battle lost by the Serbs to the Ottoman Turks but later turned into a beacon of Serbian national redemption through defeat because it marked the start of the Serbs' successful struggle to preserve their Orthodox faith during centuries of Islamic rule by the Turks.
"For the time, with Communism collapsing, it was a clever speech that Milosevic made to us in 1989," said Jovo Popovic, a former president of the Pec Town Council who was among those waiting to leave. "He said we deserved glory because from the Turks to Tito, we had suffered injustice. As for the speech's effects, however, just look around you."
Gen. Mauro del Vecchio, the Italian general commanding NATO troops in Pec, believes these "effects" can still be reversed. "We will not take Serbs out," he said. "In fact, we are escorting them back from Montenegro. We cannot allow one form of ethnic hatred to replace another now that the Albanians are back."
His sentiments are noble enough. But the future of Kosovo seems to lie more in the determined expression of Ramiz Norici, who left his restaurant in the Bronx to fight for the Kosovo Liberation Army in his native Pec.
"We are the legal army of a soon-to-be-independent Kosovo," he said, squatting by the ruins of his family's home. "The Serbs have always killed us. Why should we trust them now?"
 
The Future
Can West's Plan Bring Stability?
In effect, because the West waited for years to decide that Mr. Milosevic was at the heart of the problem in the Balkans, it has ended up trying to build a Western model in one of the corners of the Balkans where multiethnicity and tolerance are least conspicuous. The West is also building on the victory of what amounts to an Albanian peasant uprising led by orphaned Marxists and a motley crew of others.
But these are heady times in the Balkans. They bring Javier Solana, the Secretary General of NATO, to dismal Pristina to be mobbed in the streets and to say, "We want to include this area in the beautiful house of Europe, a place of tolerance, looking to the past rather than the future."
His words reflect a unanimous Western decision to invest heavily in the Balkans and to try, after many years, to treat the problems of Yugoslavia's destruction in an overall rather than a piecemeal manner and so extend the zone of European stability southeastward. But can it work?
"It has to work," Mr. Hill said. "Balkan fatigue in Western nations is at an extreme level. We are all sick of it and we know this is the last chance."
In Bosnia, both Mr. Milosevic and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia were made partners in the Dayton accords that ended the war they had helped to prosecute, despite records of atrocities committed by both their forces. Now the West has changed tack in a way that suggests it means business in the Balkans, and has stated straightforwardly that Mr. Milosevic must go.
But the residue of eight years of destruction is bitter indeed and the moderate center in Kosovo hard to find.
Mr. Rugova has been marginalized. Another moderate, Fehmi Agani, has been murdered by the Serbs. The victory of the Kosovo Liberation Army has been the victory of Drenica farmers and expatriate hard-liners over the urban intellectuals of Albanian society in Kosovo. It has been a victory of the independence-then-perhaps-democracy school over the few who held that democracy should come first.
"Albanian history is in many ways the history of clans and families and an inability to establish relationships, loyalties or institutions beyond them," a Western official said.
Much turns on whether the K.L.A. will give up all its weapons to NATO as it has promised to do.
General Clark, the NATO commander, believes that the Albanian fighters "are about 70 percent O.K." But he added that there were many hard-liners of whom NATO had to be wary, adding, "We are not out of the woods in this part of the world."
Zeqir, who will not give his last name and calls himself the commander of the 134th brigade of the K.L.A., left his wife and two children in Switzerland to come and fight.
He says he is certain that Western countries will assist Albanians -- but not, it seems, in the way the West envisages. "NATO countries will help us with arms," he says. "That is no problem. I came to fight so that my children could live in one country, together with all Albanians, and know their language and culture."

Was Kosovo World War III?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
A thoughtful reader, Allan Hoving, sent me a note asking an intriguing question: Was Kosovo actually World War III? "O.K., so it was a short one, as world wars go, just 80 days," he wrote. "But think about it: There was genocide by indicted war criminals, and the threat of nuclear war. Nearly every major power was involved -- even China. And historic realignments have emerged. . . . All this without a single allied combat casualty -- not too shabby for a world war." 
 The truth is Kosovo was not comparable to World War I or II. Those wars were earthquakes. But while Kosovo was no earthquake, it was a bolt of lightning that certainly illuminated the new international system we are now in, the system of globalization.
To begin with, the NATO intervention in the Balkans was made possible by the fact that the two great wars in Europe in this century -- the great tribal war between Germany and France, which was at the heart of World Wars I and II, and the cold war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. -- had both subsided, erasing the most important and paralyzing divisions and walls in Europe. The German-French entente made NATO intervention to quash the Balkan civil wars possible, and the collapse of the Soviet Union made NATO's intervention deep into the former Soviet sphere of influence permissible.
The falling of walls, and globalization, played another role in this war as well. When the war in Kosovo erupted, several people asked whether it didn't make obsolete my Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention, which pointed out that "No two countries that both had a McDonald's had ever fought a war against each other since they each got their McDonald's." After all, Belgrade had McDonald's, as did every NATO country. My answer was, let's see how the war ends.
Look what happened. As the Pentagon will tell you, air power alone brought this war to a close in 78 days for one reason -- not because NATO made life impossible for the Serb troops in Kosovo (look how much armor they drove out of there), but because NATO made life miserable for the Serb civilians in Belgrade. Belgrade is a modern city integrated with Western Europe, with a population that wants to be part of today's main global trends, from the Internet to economic development, which the presence of McDonald's symbolizes.
Once NATO turned out the lights in Belgrade, and shut down the power grids and the economy, Belgrade's citizens demanded an end to the war. It's that simple. Not only did NATO soldiers not want to die for Kosovo -- neither did the Serbs of Belgrade. They wanted to be part of the world, more than they wanted Kosovo to be part of them. They wanted McDonald's re-opened, much more than they wanted Kosovo re-occupied. So, yes, there is now one exception to the Golden Arches Theory -- an exception that, in the end, only proves how powerful is the rule.
This war also illustrated just how much the world is now dominated by U.S. power. Russia and China, as much as they chafed at this war, were unable to do anything about it. I was in the lobby of NATO's Brussels headquarters last month when I saw a Russian woman journalist there, walking in circles next to the Coke machine, talking on her cell phone in Russian. She reminded me of Russia's troops in Kosovo, trying to assert their identity in a world of pax Americana. But that's why this war also highlighted the backlash brewing against America, which is now referred to as "the capital of global arrogance," not only by Iranians, but by Russians, Chinese and half our NATO allies.
But while there is much that was post-modern about this war, there was something pre-modern as well -- the barbaric mass-murdering and rapes that the Serb military engaged in in Kosovo. This was old-fashioned evil, although even it had a certain bizarre 21st-century twist.
The Serbs quickly realized that U.S. satellites were now so good they could track every mass grave they dug, down to the shovels. "So in the end they were even more brutal," said David Scheffer, the U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues. "The Serbs tried to erase the evidence of their behavior by burning bodies, excavating graves, destroying documents and even abducting Kosovar witnesses and taking them away with them." But modernity may catch up with them, notes Mr. Scheffer, because forensic technology is now so sophisticated: at one mass grave site -- Izbica -- F.B.I. experts have been able to document what happened from scraps of evidence, even though all 155 bodies were removed.
So, no, Kosovo wasn't W.W.III. It didn't change the world, but it has illuminated how much the world has changed.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Budget Bog And What Put Pataki There

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 1

 BODY:
On its face, New York State's long-running budget stalemate is simple enough. Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, wants to cut, while the Democratic Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, wants to add.
The budget is three months overdue, but some day, the Governor, the Speaker and the Republican State Senate leader, Joseph L. Bruno, will agree on a plan of around $73 billion. That is a 14 percent rise over three years, a healthy clip that would ordinarily be enough to keep everyone happy. 
 So why are legislators, especially Democrats, furious with the Governor? With a $2 billion surplus and a galloping economy, why does the Governor want to cut education and health care?
A piece of the answer is that after a sharp spending increase last year, as he ran for re-election, Mr. Pataki has no choice but to practice restraint this year.
The larger answer, according to independent fiscal analysts and a lot of legislators in both parties, is that two years in a row, the Governor has bungled the politics of dealing with the Legislature.
"I think we could have arrived at the same result without making everyone angry," said Diana Fortuna, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit organization, "and without still being here in July, waiting for a budget."
Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's press secretary, said it would not have mattered if the Governor had handled things differently. "The idea that the Assembly Democrats would be satisfied with reasonable spending increases just belies facts," he said.
But take the state's last two fiscal years, and Mr. Pataki's current proposed budget. Subtract the money supplied by the Federal Government, and the year-by-year increases in state spending are 3.5 percent, 11.7 percent and 1.8 percent. Plotted on a graph, it looks like a roller coaster's path, and that is mostly the Governor's doing.
Renee Boicourt, managing director for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, said, "I can't think of another state that has had such wide fluctuations in spending."
Mr. McKeon insisted that it was the overview that counts, not the annual steps. That ignores the Capitol's internal workings, which are as much psychology as politics.
A little history: there were very late budgets in 1995 and 1996, the first two years of the Pataki administration, when the Governor was trying to make deep budget and tax cuts, and close a yawning deficit. In 1997, the budget was the latest in history, but that was due almost entirely to the unrelated fight over rent controls. Last year, with the state awash in money, the Legislature passed a budget just two weeks late, the best showing in five years.
The roots of this year's angst lie in the last two years.
In 1997, lawmakers enacted major tax cuts and promised new education programs like expanding prekindergarten, all to be phased in over five years. Combined with tax cuts passed last year, they made $5 billion a year in promises that will come due in the next few years.
"That's the real problem," said Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit group in Albany. "That's what's driving Pataki's austerity now."
But a little less austerity would be needed if the Governor had not been so generous last year. Incumbents seeking re-election in boom times are expected to raise spending, but even by that standard, Mr. Pataki's proposed 8 percent increase, which over the fiscal year turned out to be 11.7 percent, was high.
Mr. Pataki balked last year when the Legislature added more spending, but he knew as well as anyone that a Governor's proposal is always seen as a floor for the Assembly and the Senate to build on.
After the Legislature passed the budget, the Governor vetoed $1.6 billion in items, inflicting a wound to his relations with legislators that still has not healed.
This year, he proposed a rise of only 1.8 percent, to $72.7 billion, infuriating Democrats again. But the promised tax cuts, and last year's fat budget, left him little choice.
Now accept, as the Governor says, that the tax cuts are non-negotiable. What if he had proposed a smaller increase last year, leaving the Legislature room to add at least some of its pet projects? What if, instead of a big increase one year and a small one the next, he had sought steadier growth?
"Everybody wouldn't be so mad at each other," Mr. Mauro said. "All this grief might not be necessary."
Then again, it wasn't the Legislature that Mr. Pataki was trying to make happy last year. It was the voters.

HEADLINE: Reviving the Economics of Fear;
InBad Times, Consumers Might Simply Refuse to Spend

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Anyone who lived through the Great Depression or studied economics in its aftermath quickly learned that even when the Government prodded people to spend more, they would not do so in frightening times. Then came the prosperous decades. Americans began to spend freely, in good times and bad, and the image of the recalcitrant consumer faded from college courses. Now, suddenly, it is coming back.
Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, is helping to resurrect the old concept. In last-minute revisions to the latest edition of his textbook for undergraduate economics majors, he upgraded the discussion of the resistant consumer from a single, skeptical footnote to a respectful consideration. "When you go 50 years without a phenomenon being relevant, it dies out of the curriculum," he said. "Now it's relevant again." 
 What makes it relevant is the situation in Japan, where the central bank has reduced interest rates virtually to zero, yet consumers have stubbornly held back from borrowing or spending. Businesses have been similarly resistant. Not since the early years of the Great Depression has any major industrial nation gone through such an unnerving experience of offering, in effect, to give away money and finding few takers.
That is hardly the case in the United States, where the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, and where consumers continue to enjoy a long spending spree. But even if a total collapse of consumer confidence seems improbable in America any time soon, it is increasingly viewed by mainstream economists as a real possibility.
"One could imagine that happening here," said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist and textbook author who nevertheless puts the odds of a consumer freeze-up in America at less than 1 in 100, and does not yet mention the concept in either his beginning or intermediate economics texts. "I deal with rules, not exceptions," Mr. Mankiw said. "My market is mainly American students, not Japanese."
Mr. Mankiw, who is 41 and has known only economic prosperity in his lifetime, is on sabbatical this year. But if he were teaching, he said, he would put aside his grave doubts and, making an exception, lecture on the phenomenon of unshakable consumer resistance -- "in the context of Japan."
Mr. Gordon, who is 58, is already giving fresh emphasis in class to a concept that has received little attention since the 1970's. And so are other professors, although the idea of an utter consumer shutdown runs so counter to the standard, modern-day beliefs of their profession.
"I will make my students aware of the problem; in fact, I informally began to talk about it this past year," said Mark Gertler, a New York University economist. "A lot of students at N.Y.U. come from abroad, and they are interested in practical problems. When they see a connection between theory and what is actually happening, in this case in Japan, they get quite excited."
The professors are, in effect, dusting off a phenomenon first described by the British economist John Maynard Keynes in the 1930's and soon termed, in economic jargon, a liquidity trap. It means that the demand for goods and services consistently falls short of a nation's capacity to produce them despite short-term interest rates as low as zero. The central bank loses its power to steer the economy. That may be hard to imagine in the United States today, where the Federal Reserve, with its constant attention to interest rates, has helped to keep consumer spending robust for the better part of a decade.
"I know that when you flood the place with money, people will spend it," Mr. Gordon said.
But even as Mr. Gordon and other economists insist that conditions in America will never drive interest rates down to zero, they are being prodded on two counts to raise that very possibility in the classroom. One prod is Japan, where rates are indeed that low, yet people are not borrowing or spending. The other is Paul Krugman, 46, a much-quoted traditional economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has broken with conventional wisdom and now argues that what is happening in Japan can happen in America.
That change in thinking did not come until Japan was already in deep trouble. "What sensible people like me believed just a couple of years ago was that basically demand -- the lack of it -- was not a problem; inflation was," Mr. Krugman said.
Holding to this view, he traveled to Japan to see conditions for himself. He constructed a mathematical model, a standard tool of modern economics, to demonstrate that printing more money and lowering interest rates, even down to zero, would succeed in stimulating demand and expanding an economy. "Instead, I succeeded in proving to myself that this was not necessarily true," he said. He concluded that a liquidity trap was possible after all. It was no longer just a historical curiosity -- a fading memory of the Depression and the teachings of Keynes. It had happened in Japan.
Among professional economists, Mr. Krugman was not the first to conclude that Japan had fallen into a liquidity trap. A small group of Keynesian economists already had this in mind. And as early as 1996, some conservatives, among them John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, who does not consider himself a Keynesian, wrote that Japan was caught in a liquidity trap. Interest rates controlled by the Bank of Japan, that country's central bank, had declined to nearly zero in 1995 from 7 percent in the early 1990's, just after Japan's stock market and real estate bubbles burst, shocking the nation.
A similar shock could frighten Americans enough to freeze up their spending, Mr. Krugman argues. A sharp and rapid decline in stock market prices, or another hedge fund failure, like that of Long-Term Capital Management last summer, or another big default, like Russia's -- any of these could do the trick. American interest rates would not have as far to fall as Japan's to get to zero. The short-term rate controlled by the Fed is 5 percent today.
"How much spending would Americans do," Mr. Krugman asks, "if the Dow Jones industrial average got up above 13,000 and then dropped to 7,000? Certainly a lot less than now."
However late he may be to come to his new position, Mr. Krugman has one of the loudest voices in his profession. His influence stems, in part, from his prolific writing and his gift for explaining economics to noneconomists in simple sentences and easy-to-understand metaphors.
Drawing on these skills, he has been punching away at a set of beliefs that has dominated mainstream economics since the 1970's. With Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas at the University of Chicago taking the lead, an old pre-Keynesian view emerged in new theoretical clothing. People were declared to behave rationally. If for some reason they pull back as spenders, then prices drop until they buy again. There is always a price that pleases rational shoppers, who will then buy the existing supply of goods and services. Markets clear, as economists put it. And if they do not clear right away -- if companies resist cutting prices and a slowdown develops, even a recession -- well, the Government can step up spending, or the Fed can cut rates and give the process a kick.
"For most of the people getting their graduate degrees in economics today, this explanation is comfortable," said David Romer, a 41-year-old economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
But no serious provision is made in this thinking for what Keynes foresaw. He theorized that consumers would stubbornly resist spending, a sensible move for a worried, hard-pressed family but irrational for the economy as a whole. Companies find themselves forced to cut production, and layoffs, lost wages, debts and defaults accelerate the slide toward a recession or even a depression.
Mr. Krugman has just expressed his concerns in "The Return of Depression Economics" (W. W. Norton & Company), his fifth book for a general audience. For his colleagues, he has explained his new mathematical model in technical papers, including one in the current issue of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity entitled, not so technically, "It's Baaack: Japan's Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap."
That paper has become a focus of the growing debate among economists over liquidity traps and what to do about Japan -- and whether its problem is truly a liquidity trap. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, for one, blames inept Government policy and a damaged banking system for Japan's troubles -- not a liquidity trap. He asserts that the Fed, if put to a similar test, could revive consumer spending in America's healthier, more flexible system. For him, liquidity traps can be avoided, however possible they might be in theory.
"Japan's current economic problems," Mr. Greenspan told a Congressional committee two weeks ago, grew out of that nation's "failure to address the damage to the financial system in a timely manner." In similar fashion, he said, "while the stock market crash of 1929 was destabilizing, most analysts attribute the Great Depression to ensuing failures of policy."
But Mr. Krugman wonders whether America is so immune from the perils of liquidity traps, even if policy makers take the right steps. "How can we be sure," he writes, "that next year, or the year after, our own system may not turn out to have hidden flaws, that we ourselves may not be vulnerable to crisis?"

HEADLINE: A School Regains Stellar Reputation;
Students Outshine the Elite In Standardized Test Scores

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
On a muggy day in July 1987, two busloads of students, teachers and administrators traveled from their ramshackle school building in Queens to a sprawling cemetery in Brooklyn to memorialize the man for whom their recently revived high school was named: Townsend Harris.
A New York chinaware merchant who became the first United States Ambassador to Japan, Townsend Harris died in 1878 in relative obscurity, and his grave at Green-Wood Cemetery in Sunset Park went unattended for decades. The entourage from the school, which had reopened in 1984 after being shuttered for 42 years, refurbished the grave, installing a black marble plaque and a stone lantern. 
 The ceremony was a symbolic moment for a school that critics had fought to keep closed. The proposal to reopen Townsend Harris came at a time when the city was looking to move away from such schools that essentially skimmed off the best students. So critics mounted a campaign urging parents not to send their children there.
But they did. And today, the school is embraced by residents and educators alike. In 15 years, Townsend Harris has climbed to the top of academic charts in the state and across the country, and four years ago moved into a glinting new building on the Queens College campus in Flushing. It even outshone the venerable Stuyvesant High School in this year's State English Regents exam.
"In the beginning, there was a lot of political pressure that really was not in our favor," said Malcolm G. Largmann, the school's 62-year-old principal. "There was a rumor every June that we would not be back. But by the fifth year, it was clear that we were here to stay."
Teachers and parents largely credit Dr. Largmann, a strict disciplinarian who runs a rigid academic program, for Townsend's success. They also say that the school's humanities-based curriculum propels its students academically and gives them an edge on standardized tests like the Regents and the S.A.T.'s. According to state statistics for the 1997-98 school year, all of the school's graduating seniors went on to a four-year college.
A old-guard tweedy intellectual who grew up in Borough Park, Brooklyn, Dr. Largmann has brought mostly veteran teachers to a staff that has a low turnover. But the school's achievement is underscored by the fact that students must apply to gain entry. Although the school does not use an entrance exam, its admissions formula considers test scores and grades among other criteria.
Students have access to unlimited resources at Queens College, and seniors can take college courses. "Our reputation is that of a tough school," Dr. Largmann said. "If a student applies here, they know what's expected."
Indeed, the school's more than 1,000 students quickly become aware of the strict code of discipline and study when they enter as freshman. They have no study halls. Most schools start the day with homeroom, but Townsend Harris students start with their first class. Many spend the first three years studying into the wee hours of the morning and are known for carrying some of the heaviest backpacks in the city. Though they complain about the pressure, many students are driven by it, giving the school a palpable esprit de corps.
"The teachers are very demanding," said Anthony A. Prince, a 17-year-old of St. Albans, Queens, who graduated last week and will attend Brown University in the fall. "They expect the best of you, and it's something that pays off in college. I've spoken to graduates of Townsend Harris who say the transition period from high school to college is a breeze. It's actually less work and less stressful. The teachers put the work on here, but it pays off in the end."
Dr. Largmann, a short, thin, gray-haired man, often stops into classes unannounced to hold discussions and roams the halls to make sure everyone is in class. Students tend to scurry when they see him. One day recently, students lingering around the outdoor amphitheater during lunchtime fled when Dr. Largmann walked outside to show a visitor the school's seven-story beige brick exterior. They returned when he left.
Alan Fu, a 17-year-old from Bayside, Queens, who was editor of the school newspaper said that Dr. Largmann is less stern when he is among upperclassmen.
"He's really a good guy," said Alan, who will attend Northwestern University in the fall. "He's just very demanding."
Some parents fear that the school's air of intensity and obedience could force students to lose individuality.
"Academically, it's an excellent school," said Eddie Marritz, an Upper West Side resident whose daughter, Leda, 17, commutes to Townsend Harris. "There is an authoritarian tone, which I think squashes certain forms of individualism. This is a high school for humanities, but I think in general it can benefit from more arts."
Like its predecessor but unlike other selective schools, Townsend Harris seeks to give students a classical education in liberal arts, requiring each to take two years of Latin or ancient Greek and three years of a modern language. Community service is also required.
Lynne Greenfield, the assistant principal supervisor of the humanities division, describes her department as the backbone of the school. She said it was instrumental in helping eleventh graders outscore students at other elite schools on the English Regents exam in January. About 78 percent of the school's juniors passed the exam with distinction compared with about 67 percent at Stuyvesant and 66 percent at Bronx High School of Science.
"You don't prepare specifically for the test," said said. "We just prepare kids to read critically and to write well."
Townsend Harris is not considered an elite school because it does not have an admissions exam, but it can compete with them. In 1997, it tied with Stuyvesant for second place in performance on the Regents exams and just one point behind Bronx Science, according to school report cards released by the state. Since 1988, its students have won six Westinghouse Science awards, a high school competition that is now sponsored by the Intel corporation.
Debra Michlewitz, a 47-year-old English teacher at Townsend Harris who lives in Queens, said she bought a house zoned for Benjamin N. Cardozo, a high performing high school in Bayside, so that her son, Michael Pasinkoff, could attend it. But Ms. Michlewitz, who has worked at Townsend Harris for 11 years, said she changed her mind when she began working at the school. Michael, 18, graduated last week from Townsend Harris and will attend Rutgers University in the fall.
"Over time, parents have become aware of the school," said Ms. Michlewitz. "We do team teaching. We talk to kids about Euclidian math, and the Regents sequential math exam now requires students to explain their answers in writing. This is nothing new for our students."
The school did not have a dynamic start after it reopened. It was strenuously opposed by neighborhood and vocational high school officials and parents in Queens who thought it would lure away the best freshmen. As a result, it developed a complex admissions formula that uses a student's neighborhood as a factor. Though most come from Queens, students from underrepresented neighborhoods like Flatbush, Brooklyn have a better shot at getting in.
"At first, the residents were against it, but now it's an accepted part of the community," said Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President who has actively supported the school.
It first reopened in a cramped yeshiva on Parsons Boulevard in Queens, miles away from the original building that opened in 1849 at 23d Street and Lexington. Townsend Harris, created for sons of the merchant class, started out as a one-year preparatory school for the predecessor to the City College of New York, the Free Academy. In 1906, it became a full-fledged city high school, offering a rigorous program for intellectually gifted students.
It rapidly gained a national reputation, producing graduates like Dr. Jonas E. Salk, the developer of a polio vaccine ; Kenneth J. Arrow, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science; Herman Wouk, the novelist and Richard Rodgers, the Broadway composer.
In 1942, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia ordered that the school be closed over budget cuts. In 1980, a group formed the Townsend Harris Alumni Association and began working to re-establish the fabled school.
The group chose Queens College as its sponsor and established ties with the Japanese Consulate, which had reverence for Mr. Harris because he forged Japan's trading relationship with the West. Dr. Largmann, an assistant principal at Tilden High School in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, was tapped to run the school.
In 1987, the Townsend Harris Alumni Association discovered that Mr. Harris' grave had gone unattended for decades. They contacted Japanese officials, who agreed to help pay for the grave's six-foot, gray granite marker to be cleaned and for the plot to be refurbished.
A ceremony was in order. In the middle of July, Dr. Largmann and his staff had to scramble to find students and teachers to attend.
"It was really a special moment," Dr. Largmann said as he recalled the ceremony. "Townsend Harris has overcome a lot."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Budget Bog And What Put Pataki There

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 1

 BODY:
On its face, New York State's long-running budget stalemate is simple enough. Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, wants to cut, while the Democratic Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, wants to add.
The budget is three months overdue, but some day, the Governor, the Speaker and the Republican State Senate leader, Joseph L. Bruno, will agree on a plan of around $73 billion. That is a 14 percent rise over three years, a healthy clip that would ordinarily be enough to keep everyone happy. 
 So why are legislators, especially Democrats, furious with the Governor? With a $2 billion surplus and a galloping economy, why does the Governor want to cut education and health care?
A piece of the answer is that after a sharp spending increase last year, as he ran for re-election, Mr. Pataki has no choice but to practice restraint this year.
The larger answer, according to independent fiscal analysts and a lot of legislators in both parties, is that two years in a row, the Governor has bungled the politics of dealing with the Legislature.
"I think we could have arrived at the same result without making everyone angry," said Diana Fortuna, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit organization, "and without still being here in July, waiting for a budget."
Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's press secretary, said it would not have mattered if the Governor had handled things differently. "The idea that the Assembly Democrats would be satisfied with reasonable spending increases just belies facts," he said.
But take the state's last two fiscal years, and Mr. Pataki's current proposed budget. Subtract the money supplied by the Federal Government, and the year-by-year increases in state spending are 3.5 percent, 11.7 percent and 1.8 percent. Plotted on a graph, it looks like a roller coaster's path, and that is mostly the Governor's doing.
Renee Boicourt, managing director for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, said, "I can't think of another state that has had such wide fluctuations in spending."
Mr. McKeon insisted that it was the overview that counts, not the annual steps. That ignores the Capitol's internal workings, which are as much psychology as politics.
A little history: there were very late budgets in 1995 and 1996, the first two years of the Pataki administration, when the Governor was trying to make deep budget and tax cuts, and close a yawning deficit. In 1997, the budget was the latest in history, but that was due almost entirely to the unrelated fight over rent controls. Last year, with the state awash in money, the Legislature passed a budget just two weeks late, the best showing in five years.
The roots of this year's angst lie in the last two years.
In 1997, lawmakers enacted major tax cuts and promised new education programs like expanding prekindergarten, all to be phased in over five years. Combined with tax cuts passed last year, they made $5 billion a year in promises that will come due in the next few years.
"That's the real problem," said Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit group in Albany. "That's what's driving Pataki's austerity now."
But a little less austerity would be needed if the Governor had not been so generous last year. Incumbents seeking re-election in boom times are expected to raise spending, but even by that standard, Mr. Pataki's proposed 8 percent increase, which over the fiscal year turned out to be 11.7 percent, was high.
Mr. Pataki balked last year when the Legislature added more spending, but he knew as well as anyone that a Governor's proposal is always seen as a floor for the Assembly and the Senate to build on.
After the Legislature passed the budget, the Governor vetoed $1.6 billion in items, inflicting a wound to his relations with legislators that still has not healed.
This year, he proposed a rise of only 1.8 percent, to $72.7 billion, infuriating Democrats again. But the promised tax cuts, and last year's fat budget, left him little choice.
Now accept, as the Governor says, that the tax cuts are non-negotiable. What if he had proposed a smaller increase last year, leaving the Legislature room to add at least some of its pet projects? What if, instead of a big increase one year and a small one the next, he had sought steadier growth?
"Everybody wouldn't be so mad at each other," Mr. Mauro said. "All this grief might not be necessary."
Then again, it wasn't the Legislature that Mr. Pataki was trying to make happy last year. It was the voters.

HEADLINE: Don't Impoverish Serbs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Restraint on Rebuilding Serbia" (editorial, June 29): History has shown that economic sanctions are ineffective in changing governments and most effective in impoverishing people, as in Cuba and Iraq. In fact, poverty has tended to drive countries closer to tyranny, as in Germany after World War I, and democratic reform has been driven by wealth. In the United States and France, the liberal revolutions were organized by emergent middle classes. 
 With much of Serbia's economic infrastructure in ruins, and an absence of foreign trade, the poverty of most Serbs is almost guaranteed. The Serbs, along with the people of other embargoed states, should be allowed to do business with the rest of the world in order to raise their level of expectation for their governments.

HEADLINE: Spielberg and Partners Drop Long-Troubled Plan to Build Big Studio Complex

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 2

 BODY:
In a move that reflects a mood of industry retrenchment and ambivalence about its own grandest ambitions, Dreamworks SKG has abandoned its plan to build Hollywood's first new studio complex in more than 60 years. The company cited difficulties in arranging acceptable financing to create its planned campus of state-of-the-art sound stages as part of a sprawling 1,000-acre development near Los Angeles International Airport.
The $250 million sound-stage project was the brainchild of Steven Spielberg and his fellow moguls Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, the three of whom founded Dreamworks five years ago and with great fanfare announced plans for the studio, to be built on the site of Howard Hughes's old aircraft factory, in late 1995. But from the beginning the proposal was plagued by financial and political wrangling, environmental lawsuits and doubts about its viability, and Dreamworks threatened to abandon the site last year in a dispute with the developers over the price of land. 
 Late Thursday the studio's co-founders said they were dropping the project at the new development, known as Playa Vista, because of the problems with financing, together with rising interest rates and construction costs, and this morning's headline in Daily Variety, the industry journal, summed up the mood: "Hasta La Playa Vista, Baby."
"We have learned a great deal during the past four years, and it is clear that the move is no longer in Dreamworks's best interest," Mr. Katzenberg said in a statement. "It was simply not meant to be."
But three of the Dreamworks investors -- Mr. Geffen, Mr. Spielberg and Paul Allen, co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation -- are billionaires and could have arranged the money necessary to build the new studio, had they chosen and had their company been generating a stronger cash flow. So Hollywood executives were abuzz today with the conviction that Dreamworks's decision to abandon the project signaled a broader rethinking of the fledgling studio's goals.
Though Mr. Spielberg said in his own statement that "not building at Playa Vista in no way deters us" from the goal of building a new studio, Dreamworks officials said that in the short term, the company would probably simply expand its offices on the Universal Studios lot in the San Fernando Valley, and at the Dreamworks animation campus in nearby Glendale. Mr. Spielberg's partners -- especially Mr. Geffen, who made his fortune in the recording business, with its low overhead costs -- have long been thought to harbor less enthusiasm for building their own movie production complex than for just renting existing sound stages.
"The financing was the last straw," one Dreamworks official said. "But it was the combination of all the delays, the uneasiness about the financing, the increases in construction costs, the changes in the industry and the changes in our own thinking."
In its short history, Dreamworks has had mixed results, producing hit movies like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Antz" and the successful television sitcom "Spin City," but also disappointments like the movie "In Dreams" and the series "Ink." Further, in the four years since the project was announced, production activity in Hollywood itself has cooled considerably, as studios have shifted filming abroad to save costs. That has freed up once-overcrowded sound stages in Southern California.
"The fact is we've never had any trouble getting a stage for any of our pictures," the Dreamworks official said.
At the same time, the Dreamworks partners are said to be most happy with the financial performance of their Gameworks unit, which operates upscale computer-game arcades in shopping malls and was created without the benefit of any elaborate headquarters campus or fancy fiber-optic network of the sort envisioned for Playa Vista.
The Playa Vista developers, which are backed by a consortium of investors led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company and Goldman, Sachs & Company, said they would proceed to build their own sound stages for lease on what would have been Dreamworks's 47-acre parcel, using as a base the old hangars where Howard Hughes built his flying boat, the Spruce Goose. Already, movies like "Titanic," "Men in Black" and "Independence Day" have been filmed in part on the Hughes site.
"The phone is ringing off the hook this morning, to be quite honest with you," said a spokesman for Playa Vista, David A. Herbst. "We will retrofit the Hughes buildings, but we will also build others. We're dusting off our plans and re-examining them to see what the needs are."
The Playa Vista site, which is also scheduled to include 3,200 residential units and 3.2 million square feet of commercial office space in its first phase, is one of the last remaining large tracts of undeveloped land in greater Los Angeles. City officials spent considerable effort to help the developers lure Dreamworks to the project as anchor of a planned media campus, rewarding them for success in that task with $35 million in job tax credits. The developers will now lose that money, but expect to reapply to the city after creating their own studio plan, Mr. Herbst said.
Dreamworks closed on a $20 million purchase of its Playa Vista land in April, and the effort to build the first wholly new studio since Warner Brothers moved to the San Fernando Valley in the 1930's appeared to be back on track. But, Dreamworks officials said, they were ultimately unable to settle on financing terms for building the studio complex with investment partners, including the Union Labor Life Insurance Company, a labor pension fund group. Negotiations produced too many roadblocks, including a provision specifying that if the project came in over budget, Dreamworks could lose control of the land to the other investors.
"There were far too many controls on the deal and our ability to coordinate it," one official said.
Instead, Dreamworks will retrench in its existing operations, with live-action feature production based at Mr. Spielberg's longtime Amblin Entertainment outpost on the Universal lot; animation at the 17-acre Glendale animation campus, built while Playa Vista was tied up in delays, and the Dreamworks Records operation in Beverly Hills, which is Mr. Geffen's bailiwick. There are now five buildings on the Glendale site, with room to build two more, which would probably house offices.
The larger Playa Vista project, meanwhile, has been beset by lawsuits from a handful of environmental groups, which contend that it would despoil wildlife habitats in the Ballona Wetlands, one of the area's last remaining coastal marshes. Other environmental groups have strongly backed the developers' plan to restore a part of the wetlands, and this week a Los Angeles Superior Court judge rebuffed the latest attempt by the project's opponents to block construction.

Unlikely Dive Into the Brine: It's a Living

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
THE rain fell in fat, wet drops on Thursday morning, splattering atop the 15 orange barrels outside Lower East Side Pickles as the proprietor, Joe Davide, squinted at the sky and pronounced business "sour."
It was not much of a day to move "the product," as Mr. Davide calls his barrels of sour tomatoes, sweet red peppers, hot cherry peppers, marinated mushrooms, pimento olives, black olives, and, most of all, pickles. He has sour pickles and three-quarter-sour pickles and half-sour pickles. He has sweet pickles and large pickles and small pickles. He even has specially spiced pickles. 
 "This is something that everybody don't have," Mr. Davide said, lifting the hard plastic cover of a barrel to reveal spicy pickles swimming in the brine.
New York, Mr. Davide is quick to remind, is a pickle town. The pickle might not enjoy the glamour of the bagel or the acclaim of the knish, but just imagine a pastrami and rye without one. Yet if the pickle is everywhere in New York, it is also practically nowhere. The old pushcart pickle district on Essex Street on the Lower East Side has dwindled to a single store as most people now buy their pickles from jars in grocery stores.
But if the writing was on the wall, Mr. Davide didn't read it. He had stumbled into the business 25 years ago as a delivery driver at Guss's Pickles on the Lower East Side, but 18 months ago he left Manhattan to open his own store on East 19th Street off Avenue M in Midwood, Brooklyn. He taped a notice of rabbinical approval to his front window to assure residents in the predominantly Orthodox Jewish neighborhood that though he is Italian and a gentile, his pickles are kosher. He then sat back in a plastic chair on the sidewalk and waited in vain for what might be described as the pickle theory of economics to take hold.
"Who don't eat pickles?" he asked. "Everybody eats pickles."
During his years at Guss's, he learned how to make the brine of salt water, garlic and spices, and how to properly age cucumbers for the right degree of sourness. It was a living, but not always an easy one.
"In the beginning," conceded Mr. Davide, who is now 47, "it was embarrassing. 'What do you do? I make pickles.' I was young then. At that age, who wanted to be a pickle man?" But now he takes a certain pride in his life of pickles. When the telephone rings inside the shop, he answers, "Pickles!" He says customers shout to him on the street, "How do you do, pickles?" or "Pickle man!" He just smiles and stuffs pickles into plastic quart containers.
"We call him the pickle packer," snickered Joe Miller, his brother-in-law and employee.
Mr. Miller is helping out for the summer and his specialty seems to be marketing and public relations ("Miller, like the beer, like I'm high on life because I can't afford any better," he said by way of introduction). He's talking about a Web site and formulating plans to ship special orders of pickles nationwide. Mr. Davide listens to all this, but he isn't convinced.
"I already worked 25 years in the business," he said. "I don't want to kill myself."
HIS pickle shop shares a bathroom with Anything Goes, a discount ladies undergarment boutique on the corner, and, fortunately, the owner, Mark Bayarsky, likes pickles. Often, Mr. Bayarsky sends customers armed with bags of frilly things around the corner for a pickle on him. "When we open up the store in the morning, my whole store stinks of pickles," he said. "But I don't care. I love pickles."
Mr. Davide knows that pickles will never make him rich. He charges $4.25 for a quart of pickles, pricier than grocery pickles, but he says quality is the difference. He is picking up business from a few restaurants and delis, and Ellen Freudenheim, the polymath of all things Brooklyn, included the shop in her new book about the borough, "Brooklyn! A Soup-to-Nuts Guide." His peak times are Friday afternoons before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
But on slow days he or Mr. Bayarsky will run to the store for a few beers. They usually get a sampler, tasting different brands with different pickles in the name of market research. He knows there is not much future in pickles, but he has come to realize that it is good to be a pickle man.
"Oh yeah, pickles are popular," he proclaimed.
And with that he reclined in his plastic chair and waited for a customer.

HEADLINE: 70% of Blind Lack Jobs; Computer Mouse Shares the Blame

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 2

 BODY:
Of the blind Americans who say they want a job, 70 percent are unable to find one even though the labor market is so tight that many employers are begging for workers.
Advocates for the 750,000 Americans who are blind blame discrimination, a drop in Braille literacy and the computer mouse. 
 "The Americans with Disabilities Act seems to have had no impact on this," said Barbara Pierce, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of the Blind, which is holding its annual convention here. The act, passed in 1990, bans discrimination based on disability and requires employers to take "reasonable" steps to accommodate people with disabilities.
In addition to the 70 percent of the blind who are unemployed, the 30 percent who work are considered underemployed in relation to their qualifications, the Labor Department says.
Over the years, technology has made things much easier for blind people. Converting text to Braille, once a painstaking process, can now be done by computers, and some office equipment is available with Braille-embossed buttons.
But other technology has hurt the employment chances of the blind.
Many blind people once worked as receptionists, taking dictation and answering the phone for managers and executives. But voice mail and E-mail have changed the job description, requiring more computer skills. And software that requires the user to move around the screen with a mouse and click on icons is nearly impossible for blind people to learn.
Peg Halverson, out of a job for the last two years, said she could use software that included graphics if someone would put it in a blind-friendly format that relied mostly on keystroke commands and spoke out loud to the user to alert him or her to what was on the screen.
"I want to be employed," said Ms. Halverson, 44. "I want to contribute to society. I'm thinking, 'I have a business degree, I have basically 20 years of administrative experience, and I can't even get a customer service job.' "
Ms. Pierce said software makers that convert point-and-click programs so the blind can use them were a couple of years behind the rest of the computer industry.
Advocates for the blind said another problem had been a decline in the number of blind children learning Braille. In the past 30 years, the percentage of blind children learning Braille in the United States has fallen to less than 10 percent from about 50 percent, the federation says.
The reason: a push in the past two decades to get blind children out of special schools and place them in the mainstream with other students.
The federation backs that process, but Ms. Pierce said many school systems viewed it as a chance to cut costs by hiring fewer teachers for disabled students and rolling back Braille instruction to only once or twice a week.
Another big obstacle for blind people trying to find jobs is employers' attitudes, the advocates said. Many managers think blind people are helpless and cannot be effective workers. "This is pity-based discrimination," Ms. Pierce said.
Advocates said there was technology to help the blind in many jobs.
Some companies may balk when told that a blind employee will require a $3,000 Braille embosser that works like a computer printer that would cost less than $500. But Ms. Pierce said, there are state, Federal and private programs to help employers pay for such equipment.

HEADLINE: Clinton and South Korean Leader Warn the North Against Testing Missile

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
President Clinton and President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea used a brief meeting in Washington today to make a show of solidarity against North Korea and to warn it against testing another long-range missile in coming weeks.
"We are maintaining close coordination on all issues, on economic issues as well as security issues," said Mr. Kim, the onetime dissident who was elected President just as South Korea plunged into its economic crisis two years ago. "And I do hope that this close cooperation sends a clear message to North Korea." 
 For all the talk of cooperation, a senior Administration official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, refused to discuss South Korea's own expanding missile program. It has become the subject of increasing tension between Washington and Seoul, with Clinton Administration officials fearing that the North will regard it as a provocation.
"I am not prepared to discuss anything about a South Korean missile program," the senior official said testily after being pressed by reporters.
A week ago the Administration warned North Korea that a test of its long-range Taepodong missile would result in "very serious consequences." The official speaking today said such a test would create "serious obstacles to peace."
Asked how the United States, South Korea and Japan -- the last test flew over Japanese territory -- might respond, he ruled out suspending oil shipments or aid to the North in building light-water nuclear reactors, part of a 1994 deal under which the North is supposed to freeze its work on nuclear weapons.
The official said it would make no sense for the United States to violate the 1994 accord and invite the North to do the same by resuming its weapons project.
Later in the day Mr. Kim met with former Defense Secretary William J. Perry, President Clinton's special envoy for North Korean affairs, for an update on Mr. Perry's recommendations to the White House for dealing with the North. Last month Mr. Perry went to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to offer a deal under which the United States would gradually lift economic sanctions that have been in place since the Korean War of 1950-53.
In return the North would have to agree to stop testing and exporting missiles and to end military provocations against the South. The State Department described North Korean officials as interested in Mr. Perry's proposal. But only two weeks later, a dispute between North and South Korean fishing boats turned into a naval firefight in disputed waters west of the Korean Peninsula. More than 20 North Koreans were killed.
Mr. Kim also came here to proclaim that his country's economic troubles appeared to be well on their way to ending. Mr. Clinton congratulated him, but the White House description of the meeting made it clear that American officials remained worried that the process of reforming South Korea's economy had bogged down.

HEADLINE: New Phase Under Way In Battle Over Banking Law

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Now comes the endgame in the 20 Years War between Democrats and Republicans, Treasury Secretaries and Federal Reserve chairmen, and lobbyists from three of the nation's most powerful industries over legislation to overhaul the financial system.
Business interests and Government agencies, in a situation reminiscent of the trench warfare of an earlier era, spent years fighting to a stalemate over the legislation. The lawmakers benefited mightily in the process, using the battle among insurers, bankers and securities firms to enrich their campaign coffers by hundreds of millions of dollars. Until two months ago, they had delivered very little in return. 
 Now, however, the financial industry's investment may be paying off. With the House of Representatives' overwhelming approval on Thursday of a banking bill that would repeal 65 years of laws intended to bar banks, insurers and securities underwriters from entering one another's businesses, there is a growing consensus that this year might be different. The Clinton Administration generally likes the House legislation, and that increases the odds that a new law will be passed.
"We were very pleased with the bill, the overwhelming majority that supported it and the clear sign of what can happen when the Administration works with both sides of the aisle," said Gary Gensler, a Treasury Under Secretary. "There is finally a real chance for meaningful reform."
But it will still take what was once unthinkable for the legislation to become reality: an agreement between Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, and President Clinton.
Last fall Mr. Gramm blocked a Senate measure, robbing Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who was the committee chairman at the time, of a significant legislative victory. After he failed to win re-election, Mr. D'Amato was succeeded as head of the banking committee by Mr. Gramm, who, bucking the predictions of many on Wall Street, quickly and effectively won approval of his own version of the legislation two months ago.
The bill he produced has two provisions that the White House says would lead President Clinton to veto it. One provision gives a decided preference to the Federal Reserve over the Treasury as a top regulator for banks. The other exempts thousands of banks from requirements that they make loans to minorities and others traditionally denied access to credit.
That provision is expected to be highlighted by Mr. Clinton as he embarks on a nationwide tour next week to areas of poverty and high unemployment, in an attempt to encourage investment in some of the poorest communities.
Neither of the provisions objectionable to the White House is in the House bill, which was approved late Thursday evening by a 343-to-86 vote.
The House bill's passage was a setback for Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He has been unyielding in his view that any new banking legislation must include a provision that organizes financial conglomerates so that banks and securities firms are affiliates of a holding company.
The practical significance of Mr. Greenspan's preference is that under such a corporate structure the Federal Reserve would become the dominant regulatory agency, and the Treasury would lose much of the authority it now has as overseer of nationally chartered institutions. Mr. Greenspan has testified that he feels so strongly about the point that he would rather see no new legislation than legislation that takes the approach favored by the Treasury, which would preserve a role for the Administration as a regulator.
The House legislation follows the Treasury's approach, while the Senate bill takes the Greenspan position.
Lawmakers, Administration officials and lobbyists began to figure out how to reconcile the competing measures today.
"Gramm's strategy has been to bargain very hard and take to the conference bargaining table as many chips as he could," said Edward Yingling, the top lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
While Mr. Gramm has suggested a willingness to negotiate, it is impossible to know whether he or the Administration will blink, or whether they will ultimately be able to reach a compromise.
"Anyone who tells you that they can predict what Gramm will do is full of beans," said John H. Hanley, director of legislative strategy for the Independent Community Bankers Association.
Lawmakers say a Congressional conference to iron out the differences between the House and Senate measures may begin later this month or in August. The most positive force pushing for a law is undoubtedly the remarkable unity of the insurers, the bankers and the securities underwriters.
"We used to absolutely beat the hell out of each other on the bill," Mr. Yingling said. But as judges and regulators have interpreted the rules loosely enough to enable some affiliations between banks, insurance companies and securities firms, the lines separating those industries have blurred.

HEADLINE: Rubin Is Kidnapped, but, Hey, Who Cares?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
In his last 24 hours as Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin scolded Congress for legislation that would make life easier for money launderers, cleaned out his office and then watched in mock horror as President Clinton's closest advisers played out their fantasy: That Mr. Rubin had been captured by Japan's Ministry of Finance and held for a bizarre ransom.
The kidnapping was the plot of a video entitled "Free Bob: A Documentary," which had its premiere in the State Dining Room on Thursday night during a farewell party given by President Clinton. 
 The White House was working today to make sure that the first showing was also the last. But it will be hard to keep bootleg copies from leaking out: This may be the only economic thriller to ever star, playing themselves, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan; the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger; Defense Secretary William Cohen, and Jesse Jackson, who is called in, naturally, to negotiate Mr. Rubin's release.
The video opens with David Bloom, the NBC White House correspondent, reporting that Mr. Rubin is being held hostage in Tokyo by retired officials of the proud Japanese bureaucracy who demand that he say something -- anything -- positive about the Japanese economy. It is only a slight leap of the imagination, because last year Japanese officials repeatedly complained that Mr. Rubin's searing criticism of Japan's economic mismanagement was undercutting the Japanese Government, destabilizing its markets and contributing to the ouster of a prime minister.
Cut to the White House, already in crisis- management mode. Mr. Rubin, according to intelligence reports relayed back to the Central Intelligence Agency, will not bend. Under intense questioning by the Japanese, he will only repeat: "My name is Bob Rubin. I am a U.S. citizen. Markets go up and markets go down. I have nothing more to say."
An options memo is prepared for the President, but first there must be a turf war between the White House national security team and the White House economic team. Mr. Berger argues with Gene Sperling, the chairman of the National Economic Council and the producer of the video -- not about how to rescue the imprisoned Treasury Secretary, but over whose name goes on top of the memo.
"This is a foreign policy matter," Mr. Berger deadpans in his office. "Japan is a foreign country."
"I'm tired of this" shoots back Mr. Sperling, playing out a battle that occurs, presumably in slightly more subtle fashion, every week in Washington. "The demands the Japanese are making are economic." Mr. Berger concludes the scene by saying, "If we can't agree on this, then let him fry."
(Mr. Sperling, in addition to his acting role, was the producer, director and screenwriter. "I don't want to be called the President's economic adviser anymore," he said today. "I do film.")
Throughout the Administration's arguments, the President's press secretary is sent out to assure the world that "we're working as a team." Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton is trying to finish a crossword puzzle.
Mr. Cohen appears in the Pentagon press room to offer up the entire Navy budget, $82 billion, to pay for Mr. Rubin's hotel room bills at the Okura Hotel, his luxurious prison across from the American Embassy in Tokyo. (It might take that much: Getting a shirt pressed at the Okura runs about $20, and an informal lunch for two at the sushi bar downstairs easily tops $250.) Mr. Greenspan finally appears to deal with Japan's demands for America's gold reserves.
"Where would you like it delivered," he inquires.
"Alan Greenspan and Woody Allen have one thing in common," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers said today, assessing the Fed chairman's acting abilities while insisting on anonymity. "They both know how to play only one character."
In the end Mr. Jackson is appointed as a special envoy to mediate a solution, and goes off to Japan talking about finding "common ground between the yen and the yang." When his mission is accomplished, he declares: "Free at last, free at last. Thank God almighty, Bob's free at last."
Indeed he is. Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Rubin's longtime deputy, was sworn in as the next Treasury Secretary today in the Oval Office. Mr. Summers has already received congratulations on his new post from Japan's Ministry of Finance.

HEADLINE: Is $1 Trillion Windfall as Ephemeral as a Breeze?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Where did Congress and the Clinton Administration find $1 trillion?
The White House released a new analysis of the Federal budget this week that projected a windfall of more than $1 trillion over the next 15 years on top of the previously anticipated $4.9 trillion cumulative surplus in that time. The Congressional Budget Office then released a similar study that looked at the fiscal picture over shorter periods and closely paralleled the Administration's estimates. 
 For members of both parties, the news that the surplus was continuing to swell beyond what had been projected just a few months earlier was a little like winning the lottery and then having Ed McMahon show up on the doorstep the next morning with a check from Publishers Clearing House. There is so much money on the table that they do not quite know what to do with it.
Rest assured that they will figure something out.
But it is hard to contemplate the pile without wondering where it came from and whether it is for real.
The answers lie deep in the economy, with factors like business efficiency and the huge gains being generated by Wall Street, and deep in the Government bureaucracy, where teams of analysts make educated guesses about fiscal trends.
Early each year the White House's Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office separately produce estimates of what the Government's fiscal condition will be over the subsequent 10 or 15 years, based on their best assessments of how much tax revenue the economy will generate and how much spending current programs will require. Each of them then updates its estimates each summer.
The data that go into making the predictions rarely change substantially within a single year. But because the American economy is so big, and because any changes affect the outlook for years to come, even tiny changes can yield huge swings in revenue and spending projections, and therefore in the size of projected surpluses or, until recently, deficits. So algebra, not economics, drove much of the improvement in the new forecasts. Chalk that up to the magic of compound interest taught to every high school student.
Yet on the new projections hang all kinds of policy and political decisions, like how big a tax cut the country can afford and of what kind, how much money is available for education and health care and what can be done to shore up Social Security and Medicare.
The debate over arcane budget matters is so intense, said Rudolph G. Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, because "adjustments that are small to professional economists can have immense political importance."
Take the most recent round of changes included in the Administration's economic forecast. They seem technical, even arcane, and their link to Federal budget surpluses might seem tenuous. But they get at some fundamental improvements in the American economy and its ability to create the jobs and profits that generate tax revenues. They include an increase in the Administration's estimate of growth in productivity, or how much each worker can produce in a given period. When productivity improves, so does the economy's ability to expand without inflation -- and therefore to generate a steady increase in tax revenues.
In its new analysis, the Administration estimated that productivity growth would be 1.6 percent annually through 2002, up from 1.3 percent in the analysis it prepared in February. Over the longer run, it estimated that productivity growth would slow somewhat, to 1.4 percent annually, a figure that is still higher than its previous long-range estimate of 1.3 percent annually. The Congressional Budget Office made similar increases in its productivity estimates.
The growth in productivity also helped fuel the Administration's new estimates of economic growth. From this year through 2004, the Administration is estimating the economy will expand by an annual average of 2.5 percent, up from 2.2 percent in the Administration's last budget analysis in February. Moreover, the economy is already bigger at this point than the Administration or Congress had predicted early this year.
There is a hint of how the changing economy affects revenues -- and where the flood of new money is coming from -- in the experience of the last few years. Most of the surge in revenues is coming from individual income taxes. For next year, for example, the Administration now expects individual tax receipts to total $921 billion, up more than $21 billion since the February estimate. Corporate income tax receipts are expected to come in somewhat lower than previously anticipated, reflecting slower profit growth.
One reason the individual tax take is rising is that more people are working, and wages are rising at a healthy pace. But part of the growth in individual income tax receipts stems directly or indirectly from the long bull market on Wall Street. Individuals are reaping substantial capital gains, and more and more people are being compensated with stock or in ways that reflect the performance of their employers' shares.
The effect of the rising stock market can be clearly seen in receipts from inheritance taxes levied on estates, many of which contain big holdings of stocks and bonds that have appreciated in value tremendously in recent years. The Administration estimated that estate and gift tax revenue next year would be $31.4 billion, up from $27 billion in its February estimate.
As for the accuracy of the surplus projections, there are two issues: whether Congress or the Administration is slanting its estimates for political reasons and whether even the best nonpartisan economists can predict fiscal results even a year ahead, much less a decade or more.
Both parties present the figures in ways that advance their agendas. President Clinton has introduced 15-year projections this year in part so he can allocate tax revenues from the distant horizon to deal with long-term problems like Social Security while leaving money available to deal with other issues sooner. Before this year, no one had tried anything longer than a 10-year forecast.
But because there are two competing sets of projections, neither the Administration nor Congress could tinker much with its projections and get away with it. In fact, they often come up with remarkably similar results; their forecasts this week for the cumulative 10-year surplus were within $20 billion of each other, a tiny rounding error.
That is not to say, however, that either of them is likely to be correct. Their long-term forecasts have proved to be wildly inaccurate, and even their short-term forecasts often prove to be off by tens of billions of dollars. Three months ago, the Congressional Budget Office predicted a Government surplus of $111 billion this year. It recently increased the estimate to $120 billion.
So no one can count on the projections. Still, the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office can claim that their assumptions and projections are reasonable, which may be as good as it gets for the purpose of policy decisions whose implications play out over decades.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: PROTESTS;
Crowds Denounce Milosevic In Opposition Stronghold

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: NOVI SAD, Serbia, July 2

 BODY:
Whistling and jeering, about 10,000 people filled the main square of Yugoslavia's second-largest city tonight to demonstrate against Slobodan Milosevic and heard a parade of local opposition politicians threaten that if he does not resign as president soon, they will throw him out.
It was the first large public gathering in this Danube River city since NATO bombs knocked out three bridges that were its economic arteries. The city is the capital of the province of Vojvodina, the richest food-producing region in Yugoslavia. 
 Like Kosovo, Vojvodina was autonomous under Tito, but was stripped of that autonomy by Mr. Milosevic, and now the city is controlled by his opponents.
The crowd and the politicians had little to say about the bomb attacks. Instead, as in the bomb-damaged Serbian city of Cacak, where the first opposition rally since the war took place on Wednesday, they blamed all their troubles on Mr. Milosevic.
Mixing sarcasm, black humor and threats of violent defiance, speaker after speaker blamed the Serbian leader for a decade of fomenting lost wars, for ruining the economy of Vojvodina, for forcing their children leave the country to find work and for fouling up local efforts to repair the bridges.
Their repair has become a new theme separating Belgrade, which wants to control the construction work and the money for it, and the opposition and western Governments that are offering help.
"When we decide to throw him out by force, he will not be there by morning," said Nenad Canak, president of the League of Social Democrats, a Vojvodina-based party that help organize the rally.
With the aroma of fresh popcorn drifting through the main square on a splendid July night, the mood of the rally was jubilant, as the crowd celebrated surviving the 11-week war.
The evening, though, also had an edge of rage. The crowd erupted in jeers as speakers complained that Mr. Milosevic's regime was sucking taxes from this province to subsidize his wars and creating fuel shortages that are hobbling the ability of farmers to harvest their crops.
Novi Sad and much of the region have voted against Mr. Milosevic and his ruling Socialist Party for much of this decade. But unlike Albanians in Kosovo, the opposition has not been violent.
"Did we die of fear or are we still alive?" Mr. Canak shouted as he started off the demonstration. Those in the crowd, young, middle-aged and old, shouted back that they were very much alive and furious to be part of Mr. Milosevic's Yugoslavia.
"My greatest wish is for Vojvodina to be a republic, but this is not the moment for that to happen," Mr. Canak told the crowd.
No police officers were in sight tonight in or around Novi Sad, unlike during the earlier rally in Cacak. The police there turned away busloads of protesters and carloads of reporters outside of town. The police here did arrest four men on Thursday for handing out fliers about tonight's rally. One was beaten up before they were all released.
A number of people said they came to tonight's demonstration because they believe that, in the end, the only way to get rid of Mr. Milosevic is to force him out. They said that street demonstrations will probably have to turn violent if they are to have any effect.
"We would like it to be peaceful, but Mr. Milosevic rose to power in blood and he will only go out in blood," said Jelena Radovanov, 27, a biologist who said she has been looking for work since she graduated from college here four years ago.
Ms. Radovanov, who came to the rally with her sister, Dobrila, a doctor, said she should have fled the country years ago, but now felt that the reputation of people from Yugoslavia was too tainted for her to emigrate.
"They look at us like we are wild animals," Dobrila Radovanov said.
Vojvodina is one of the most ethnically mixed parts of Yugoslavia, with Serbs constituting about half of its population of two million, but with large numbers of ethnic Hungarians, Croats, Slovaks and Romanians. Intermarriage is common. The Radovanov sisters are half Serbian, half Hungarian.
Asked if she blames the Americans for bombing her city, Jelena Radovanov said, "Not even a tiny bit. I am sorry for the bridges. I cried when they went down. But if that was the price we had to pay to stop the killing in Kosovo, then I am willing to pay it."
Her sister interrupted to say, "We are not all bad in this country. The world shouldn't hate us so."
The substance of tonight's demonstration was the problems the city is having in trying to fix the bridges before winter. Novi Sad, which is divided from some of its suburbs by the Danube, now has to haul people back and forth across the river on barges pushed by tugboats.
Vienna has agreed to give Novi Sad a temporary bridge and to pay $10 million to erect it, Mr. Canak told the crowd. But he said that the Yugoslav Government is insisting that the Austrian money be funneled through Belgrade, where Mr. Canak said he fears it will stolen.
He also said that the Yugoslav Government has denied visas to six Viennese engineers who want to come to Novi Sad and started planning construction of the bridge.
The fight over the bridges in Novi Sad gets at the central question of how -- or if -- the West should get involved in aiding Mr. Milosevic's Yugoslavia after the war.
The United States and many European countries have said that, until Milosevic is removed from power, they will give only food, medicine and perhaps help in restoring electricity.
But opposition leaders argue that these limits will backfire, punishing Mr. Milosevic's victims and goading Serbs into rallying around their government. Some opposition leaders have been trying to persuade European countries to funnel aid through cities, such as Novi Sad, where the opposition is strong. They say carefully targeted help can increase popular support for getting rid of Mr. Milosevic.
Interference by Belgrade in the construction of a bridge for Novi Sad suggests that even if Western countries want to help individual cities in Yugoslavia, it will not be easy or quick to do so.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Senate Blocks Election Reforms

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 2

 BODY:
Lawmakers from Mexico's governing party have killed a package of election reforms that would have monitored spending in the presidential primary campaigns now under way and allowed Mexican expatriates to vote in the national elections next year.
In April the measures were passed in diluted form by the lower house of Congress, which is controlled by the opposition. But on Thursday senators from the party of President Ernesto Zedillo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, mobilized the majority they enjoy in the upper house to stun the opposition by blocking the reforms from even going to the floor for debate. 
 The session ended in a shouting match, with opposition Senators yelling: "Cheaters! Cheaters!" and the Senate leader banging down his gavel on the proceedings and marching out abruptly.
The opposition defended the reforms as crucial to fortifying the democratic framework for the presidential election on July 2 of next year, which will be the most competitive ever held in Mexico.
The senators from the governing party, which has won every presidential election since the 1920's, denounced most of the measures as unconstitutional and said they had simply moved to spare themselves a politically damaging but ultimately meaningless public debate.
The measure would have created campaign finance limits and reporting requirements during the primary period. And it would have eased the formation of opposition coalitions, to counter the governing party's electoral might.
It would also have given the vote to Mexicans outside the country; 10.1 million Mexicans, voters potentially disenchanted with the governing party, live in the United States.
For a month the Mexican Congress has been in special session, past the end of its regular term. Its main purpose was to pass some sort of electoral reform. Today, one year before the presidential election, was the last day that the legislation could have been approved by the Senate in time to take effect for that vote.
Although the governing party succeeded in softening the reforms in the lower house, it finally voted against them in that house anyway. The legislation was expected to meet defeat in the Senate, where the party holds 75 of 127 seats.
But the opposition senators were counting on the debate to give the public its view of the issue.
"We are in a democratic transition where reforms to open up and scrutinize the system are of paramount importance," said Senator Luis H. Alvarez, a member of the right-of-center National Action Party. "We especially wanted to tighten campaign financing to keep drug traffickers out of the elections. But the PRI didn't agree, and they stopped us in an incredibly heavy-handed way."
One part of the reform would have authorized the Federal Elections Council to draw up plans for Mexicans living outside Mexico to vote in the presidential election. Government officials have said it would be a logistical nightmare to set up a voting system for the millions living in the United States by next July. And they have warned that American citizens and elected officials might be antagonized by so many Mexicans' displaying their allegiance to their home country's politics.
Senators of the governing party insisted that a constitutional amendment, not just a new law, would be required to authorize the overseas vote. Opposition leaders argued that the the measure was being fought because most Mexicans in the United States were believed to oppose the governing party, blaming Mr. Zedillo and his allies for creating the economic hardship that forced them to leave Mexico.
The reforms would also have set, for the first time, campaign finance limits and reporting requirements during the primaries. Mexico's political parties are holding primaries to pick their presidential candidates for the first time ever.
In addition, opposition parties would have found it easier to band together to form coalitions. Even though opinion polls show that opposition voters make up the majority in most states, the governing party continues to win elections because the opposition is split between the National Action Party and the left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution.
"Some coalitions are already legal under Mexican law," said Senator Eduardo Andrade Sanchez, a member of the governing party. "But if the opposition thinks we are going to make it even easier for them to gang up against us, they're crazy."
Senators from the governing party adopted the tactic of simply staying away from the session on Thursday, using the strength of their numbers to prevent a quorum. Under the rules of the special session, with no quorum there could be no debate and no second chance, so the measure was dead on arrival.
"The opposition wanted a reform tailored to its interests," Senator Andrade said. "And when they didn't get it, they wanted to tangle us in a debate to accuse us of being opposed to change. So we didn't let them."

HEADLINE: An Uphill Struggle at City College

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
At its founding as the Free Academy more than 150 years ago, City College was viewed as a radical experiment in providing social mobility to immigrants and other disadvantaged young people. The experiment was a stunning success, and the accomplishments of its brightest students brought the college fame as a Harvard for the proletariat.
For many disadvantaged students, the college still represents a pathway to the middle class, but much of the focus at the college has shifted to the myriad and difficult problems of the least prepared students. Far from being on a par with the Ivy League, its critics now charge, it is little more than a poorly run remedial mill. 
 With their move this week to replace City College's president, Yolanda T. Moses, CUNY's trustees hope to engage in another experiment: to see if they can restore City College's luster when its enrollment is sliding, most of its students need remedial instruction and its programs in architecture, engineering and teacher education all face questions about their accreditation.
"In the eyes of everyone, City College is still the flagship of the university, and if there are problems there, it reflects poorly on the whole university," said Herman Badillo, CUNY's new chairman and a City College graduate himself. "We have to take forceful action to improve City College and bring it into the top tier again. We have a long way to go."
There is clearly much to be done.
Christoph M. Kimmich, CUNY's interim chancellor, says the tasks include rebuilding the college's management, gaining reaccreditation for the college's professional programs and deciding how the campus will cope with CUNY's plan to remove remedial classes from the senior colleges.
With about 70 percent of its entering freshmen failing one or more of the university's placement examinations, City College stands to lose many students in September 2000 when the new policy is scheduled to take effect on its campus.
Dr. Kimmich says the acting president must also insure that the college's momentum in several new science and engineering research efforts is not lost. That will take more financial support from both Albany and Washington.
"We cannot miss the opportunity to stimulate ongoing and new research," he said. "If we interrupt that, it would be a serious loss."
Whoever is named interim president will not have an easy job. On a campus at which the faculty is sometimes described as difficult and contentious, unpopular changes are likely to face lively challenge. Because City College is so visible, the process is likely to take place under a spotlight. And it comes as sensibilities are already on edge because of sharp criticisms of the university by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, CUNY trustees and others.
In addition, City College is more complicated to run than many of CUNY's other campuses, since it is a research institution with several doctoral and professional programs.
"City College is basically a university unto itself, though it is treated as just another college," said John Graziano, a music professor who is chairman of the college's Senate.
At the same time, many students and faculty members are eager for change, and hope their next president will be a talented manager with a strategic vision.
"The next president has to be a person with a lot of respect and savvy, because he or she will have to come up with a mission for the college and will have to make many, many painful decisions," said Mizanoor Biswas, a City College graduate student in economics who is president of the University Student Senate and a CUNY trustee.
"The board is quite adamant about helping in any way they can," Mr. Biswas said. "They would like to see the college succeed."
In Mr. Badillo's view, what needs to be done is not rocket science. He suggests that the next president should start by reviewing every program and making sure that faculty members set high standards; he said they should not follow the example of the professor profiled in James Traub's 1994 book about the college, "City on a Hill," who gave passing grades to students who were doing poorly.
"I want to make sure there is accountability, and that professors do not just pass everyone along," he said.
Dr. Kimmich, CUNY's interim chancellor, is hopeful that efforts by Dr. Moses and others at City College to draw up a new strategic plan during the last year will not get stalled by the change in leadership.
"The early draft focused on the institution and its strengths in its two professional schools, its acknowledged strength in the sciences and its strong liberal arts core," he said. "Those seem to be the very powerful core for a future City College."
But he acknowledged that in an era in which colleges are judged more by the quality of their students than by the education the students receive, a critical question is whether City College can transform itself without significantly raising its admission standards and altering its student body.
Or, as Dr. Kimmich put it, "Is there a way to attract a student body that is able to take more advantage of the faculty who are there today?"

HEADLINE: After a Month's Lull, Employers Report Strong Job Gains for June

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
After idling in May, the great American job engine is purring again.
Despite another big drop in factory jobs, the nation's employers added more than a quarter of a million new workers to their payrolls in June. The overall gain, of 268,000, followed a decline of 5,000 in May. Nearly two of every three Americans were at work last month, a record. And the pay of rank-and-file workers jumped 5 cents an hour, to $13.23. 
 With the labor market tighter than at almost any other time in the last three decades, Americans who have jobs are acting a bit cockier -- something that they had refrained from doing until recently. In June, the so-called quit rate -- the fraction of people looking for work who left their last jobs without having lined up another -- rose to 14.5 percent, the highest level since the end of the long, strong 1980's boom. The rate is a classic barometer of consumer confidence, which by other accounts has recently strengthened.
In short, the economic picture that persuaded Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and his colleagues to nudge up a key interest rate on Wednesday was not materially altered by the report issued yesterday by the Labor Department. The economy may no longer be in overdrive, as it was last winter. Yet it still has enough momentum to keep spending and production stronger than the Fed would like, given its worry that the longest peacetime expansion ever will rekindle inflation.
Stock and bond investors reacted cheerily to the news, and major market indexes hit new highs. Page B1.
"The economy is still very strong," said Joshua Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management. "Whatever concerns Alan Greenspan had about a shrinking pool of workers, he's still got them."
Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said simply, "The sun is shining brightly."
In June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of households (on the basis of which the unemployment rate is calculated) showed that the number of new entrants to the labor force rose even more, by nearly 400,000, than the number of new jobs -- yet another sign that Americans are more confident than ever that work is there for the asking. The number of discouraged workers -- those who are not looking because they think there are no jobs for them -- has dwindled to just over 200,000 in the entire country, down 90,000 from a year ago.
The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.3 percent in June from 4.2 percent in May. But Katherine Abraham, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issues the monthly jobs report, said the uptick was not statistically meaningful and called the unemployment rate essentially unchanged. It has remained between 4.2 percent and 4.4 percent since November.
Among the unemployed are plenty of people looking for better positions. A bigger portion of people who are job hunting -- not those who retired or returned to school or decided to stay home with a child -- quit their jobs without having other positions. This rate, now at 14.5 percent, is still shy of its peak of 16.5 percent, reached in January 1990. But it is a lot higher than in mid-1996, when it was below 10 percent.
The biggest beneficiaries of the current demand for labor are groups of workers who have traditionally suffered the most joblessness. The unemployment rate for blacks, already at a record low, dropped by a couple of tenths of a percentage point last month, to 7.3 percent, half the rate during the last recession. Joblessness among Hispanic workers, 6.8 percent, also remained close to a record low.
The jobs report was only one of many recent signs that the economy continues to barrel along at a pace well above its long-term trend, which most economists consider to be 2.5 percent to 3 percent a year. With income growing rapidly and corporate profits firming, spending by consumers and businesses has remained robust, and despite the yawning gap between the amount of goods imported and exported, domestic production has been picking up, too.
The only sector of the economy that had been suffering from serious weakness and had restrained overall growth -- manufacturing -- is pretty clearly on the mend. The most recent reading by the National Association of Purchasing Management suggests that output has expanded for five consecutive months even as inventories shrank relative to sales and as order backlogs swelled. And the Commerce Department reported yesterday that factory orders bounced up 1.1 percent in May after dropping by 1.4 percent in April.
The policy makers at the Fed will be looking at such numbers before their scheduled meetings later this year. "Will the world look different on Aug. 24 or Oct. 25 than on June 30? We don't think so," said Ed McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, which estimates that the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second quarter and predicts that the Fed will probably raise rates again.
Admittedly, the rebound in industrial production has not translated into more hiring. Factory payrolls shrank by 35,000 in June, mostly because of job losses in aircraft, electronics and apparel, bringing the total number of manufacturing jobs that have vanished in the last 15 months to nearly half a million. But hiring typically lags behind sales increases as companies initially try to fill the extra orders by adding hours and improving efficiency.
Indeed, the Labor Department said overtime edged up to 4.7 hours a week in June from 4.6 hours in May. It is also possible that manufacturers are letting temporary-help suppliers, which are classified as service firms, do the first round of hiring. "We're probably not accurately capturing the number of people actually at work in factories," Mr. Feinman speculated. The temporary-help industry added 19,000 workers in June, the ninth consecutive month of increases.
Construction employment rebounded in June after dropping sharply in May. (It turns out that the May decline was mostly a reflection of warm weather last winter that disrupted the usual seasonal hiring pattern.) Though the housing boom has cooled with higher mortgage rates, contractors hired 26,000 workers last month, many of them plumbers, roofers and electricians,
As usual, the part of the economy that did the bulk of the hiring in June was the sprawling service sector, which includes everything from the corner copying store to giant multinational banks. These companies hired a total of nearly 300,000 workers. On one end of the pay and prestige spectrum, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions added some 13,000 workers. At the other extreme, retailers added some 50,000 workers, nearly half of whom wound up waiting on tables or working cash registers in restaurants or bars. Seasonal businesses -- amusement parks, lawn services, hotel chains -- did lots of hiring, too.
Amazingly, the tight labor market has not brought on much inflation. Even with the 5 cent increase in average hourly earnings, pay is up just 3.7 percent from a year ago. That is about half a percentage point less than the pay increases employers were handing out last summer.

Brazilian Senate Aids Bank
Brazil's Senate approved a measure erasing $3.4 billion in questionable securities from the books of Banco do Brasil, possibly averting insolvency at the 191-year-old bank, Latin America's largest.

How World Stock Markets Fared in the Second Quarter

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
Two years after Thailand devalued the baht -- touching off the Asian currency crisis and sinking the region into an economic ravine -- signs that Asian economies have begun to revive was the big story in the second quarter.
 Indonesia, among the hardest hit at the height of the crisis, was among the best performers as the rupiah gained strength throughout the quarter and the country exhibited signs of political stability by holding its first free elections. 
 Hong Kong, too, was up strongly as the Government announced the creation of a mutual fund to dispose of its huge stock holdings, easing fears that it would flood the market and drive down prices. At the same time, investors spent most of the quarter concerned about the possibility of rising interest rates in the United States, tempering their enthusiasm.
 Outside of Asia, markets were relatively quiet. In Brazil, which devalued its currency in the first quarter, mixed signals left investors alternately bullish and bearish on the country's near-term prospects. The economy contracted more slowly than expected, but a series of rate cuts were not enough to meet investor expectations.

And Bear in Mind
(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)
 
BRIEF INTERVIEWS WITH HIDEOUS MEN, by David Foster Wallace. (Little, Brown, $24.) In their depictions of characters whose deviant behavior puts them an angstrom away from undiluted sociopathy, these stories employ an incisive moral sensibility to dissect WASP-y male self-absorption.
 
THE FIRST WORLD WAR, by John Keegan. (Knopf, $35.) A military historian narrates the conflict once characterized with nave optimism as the Great War, elegantly conveying what it felt like to live, and die, in Europe's muddy trenches.
 
I COULD TELL YOU STORIES: Sojourns in the Land of Memory, by Patricia Hampl. (Norton, $23.) Essays exploring the nature of personal narrative seek to complete, and illuminate, the following analogy: memoir: truth; memory: (Answer: received history.)
 
JONATHAN SWIFT: A Portrait, by Victoria Glendinning. (Holt, $35.) A life of the obscure country vicar and inveterate bath taker turned dirty-minded public rogue suggests that its subject may have suffered from one of the earliest recorded cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
 
MATISSE: Father & Son, by John Russell. (Abrams, $39.95.) In a biographical diptych informed by previously unpublished family correspondence, Matisse p<heart>re and Matisse fils emerge as twin titans, one at making art, the other at selling it.
 
TIMBUKTU, by Paul Auster. (Holt, $22.) Bereft of his longtime companion, this novel's flea-bitten protagonist longs for nothing more than a bed, a bone and a biscuit but will settle for perpetual enlightenment.
 
TIME OUT OF MIND: The Diaries of Leonard Michaels, 1961-1995. (Riverhead, $24.95.) The multiply and turbulently married author of "The Men's Club" set down his observations on three decades of friends, wives and children in a stack of notebooks, which he carried with him wherever he went so that no one would read them. Now you can.
 
TOUGH, TOUGH TOYS FOR TOUGH, TOUGH BOYS, by Will Self. (Grove, $23.) Short fiction, at once amusing and appalling, that glories onomatopoetically in the yucky and unmasks revulsion as a species of the genus Desire.
 
THE VIEW FROM ALGER'S WINDOW: A Son's Memoir, by Tony Hiss. (Knopf, $24.) In his steadfastly loyal, often painfully raw portrait of his father, the author maintains that the man he recalls as a loving and humane figure could not possibly have been a Soviet spy.
 
WHO'S IRISH? Stories, by Gish Jen. (Knopf, $22.) Focusing on the lives of Chinese immigrants to the United States, these short stories are concerned with the confusion of identities and tangle of loyalties that ensue when Old World parents confront their hyphenated children.

Eleanor Roosevelt
 Volume 2: 1933-1938.
 By Blanche Wiesen Cook.
 Illustrated. 686 pp. New York:
 Viking. $34.95. 
 For many years I had, hanging in my kitchen, a wonderful picture of Eleanor Roosevelt, smiling saucily in a cream satin Jean Harlow-style gown. Though she was proud to be F.D.R.'s "hair shirt," she liked pretty clothes. And I loved seeing Eleanor looking glam. It was annoying when the P.C. police dictated that her statue at the Roosevelt Memorial in Washington could have no jaunty fox fur. She is a figure of such poignancy and inspiration, rejected by her mother, betrayed by her husband, oppressed by her mother-in-law, holding her shyness and loneliness at bay with Sisyphean efforts for those in need, I liked to think she had moments when she just felt swell.
In Volume 2 of her biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, covering the years 1933 to 1938, Blanche Wiesen Cook continues her diligent pentimento, getting at the tender, sprightly creature behind the starchy, strident image, chronicling how the timid housewife and mother of five shed her chrysalis and turned into the New Deal's relentless "Eleanor Everywhere."
She refused to play the wallflower, transforming herself into a party-loving First Lady, elegant in silver lame and black satin gowns. One night, after a black-tie dinner, she and Amelia Earhart went skylarking in their long dresses, flying from Washington to Baltimore. The aviatrix in white evening gloves let Mrs. Roosevelt, who had taken flying lessons, handle the controls until the Condor did a serpentine turn. She acted with breezy informality, once shocking Howell G. Crim, the chief White House usher, by showing up in a yellow bathing suit to give him letters to mail. "Eight years later," one of his subordinates wrote, "Mr. Crim was still aghast."
Eleanor Roosevelt was 48 when she became First Lady and came to the cap- ital, labeled "that small ungenerous town" by her ferociously feminist biographer. "Before she entered the White House, E.R. cast about for models to understand her new role and decide just what she might do from within the confines of the President's house," Cook writes. "The record was grim, and every one of her predecessors sickened or died in the place. Washington was a lethal town for wives, with an odious history for women."
Not much has changed. Just in recent memory, Barbara Bush, Alma Powell and Tipper Gore have all confessed to going through periods of depression, and an often angry, sad and bitter Hillary Rodham Clinton has channeled Eleanor Roosevelt for solace on the difficulty of trying to break out of that First Lady straitjacket.
On the day of her husband's first inaugural, Mrs. Roosevelt told re- porters, "No woman entering the White House . . . can lightheartedly take up residence here." She designed the White House china and chose the flowers, but perhaps because she was abandoned, again and again, by those she loved, she was driven to help the neglected and rejected in society.
She did not triangulate. She did not worry if she was popular. She did not smile at her husband adoringly. She did not, as more modern First Ladies have so assiduously done, feign agreement with her husband on every issue. "From that time to this, no other First Lady has actually rushed for her pen to jab her husband's public decisions," Cook writes. "But E.R. did so routinely, from her first condemnation of the misogynist clause in his 1933 Economy Act which resulted in the dismissal of federally employed wives, to her major 1938 essay 'This Troubled World,' which was a point-by-point rejection of F.D.R.'s major international decisions."
It is remarkable, when you think of Hillary Clinton's treacly ghostwritten newspaper column, to see just how vinegary Eleanor Roosevelt's newspaper pieces were. In February 1933, as Franklin was preparing his first Presidential acts, Eleanor was already attacking him in her column and an unsigned editorial in a newspaper she had founded, arguing that taxes should not be lowered in the face of dire social needs, and that there should be more public spending. F.D.R., Cook writes, "demanded space in the March issue to answer his wife and defend his first legislative acts. Between his mother and his wife, F.D.R. was accustomed to outspoken opinionated women. But he did expect public unity on politically volatile issues."
Adjusting to her husband's romantic entanglements, first with her friend and social secretary, Lucy Mercer, and then with his own secretary, Missy LeHand -- F.D.R. moved a large seven-drawer highboy in front of the doors that connected his wife's study to his bedroom -- Mrs. Roosevelt did not get jealous or bitter. "Whatever she actually felt, E.R.'s public attitude toward Miss LeHand was that of first wife to second wife in the culture of extended ruling families," Cook observes. As Mrs. Roosevelt wrote in her memoir, "You Learn by Living," in a veiled reference to Missy, she was occasionally unable to "meet the need of someone whom I dearly love," and then "you must learn to allow someone else to meet the need, without bitterness or envy, and accept it."
She fought off hurts, disappoint- ment, dread and her "Griselda moods," and turned her office into a radical parallel universe: "With the women activists of the Democratic Party, E.R. spent hours preparing lists of notable candidates for every level of government work. She wrote columns, stunned radio audiences, created endless controversy. The First Lady-elect was in the news almost every day -- upsetting the complacent, encouraging people to imagine new liberal efforts to confront the Depression."
She did not engage in the shadowy manipulation practiced by other opinionated First Ladies. While her husband rarely credited or acknowledged her influence, even when he was cribbing her ideas, he encouraged her prodding. "Lady," he said, after arguing with her one night, "this is a free country. Say what you think. If you get me in Dutch, I'll manage to get myself out. Anyway, the whole world knows I can't control you."
Unlike Hillary, Eleanor ignored personal insults, sloughed off negative news stories, waved off critics who called her part of a Communist brain trust of the New Deal and Republicans who called her a Bolshevik, kept the ability to laugh at herself and galloped ahead. Her mission came ahead of her image, and she knew how to use the press to shape public opinion. When the White House had to cut its budget by 25 percent, she fired white employees, on the theory that the whites would have an easier time finding jobs than blacks. When she arranged for a housing project for the poor in West Virginia, she insisted on indoor privies, noting that in matters of simple dignity and decency, you should not be able to tell the rich from the poor.
Cook's first volume fascinated with the tragedies and struggles that shaped Eleanor's nature, and with its rich characters -- Anna Roosevelt, Eleanor's beautiful mother, who always treated her daughter like an ugly duckling and who died at the age of 29, when Eleanor was 8; Elliott Roosevelt, her charming and adoring father, who succumbed to alcoholism at 34, when Eleanor was 10; her passionate feminist teacher at boarding school in Paris, Marie Souvestre; and Franklin Delano, a mama's boy and preppy dismissed by the girls in his set as "Feather Duster."
This volume is interesting but less compelling, and should have included the war years. The writing is dutiful at points, and because Eleanor's character is formed now, and she knows her causes, there is less drama. It offers a litany of Eleanor's vigorous fights on discrimination, housing, health care, education and women's rights, and gives an exhaustive account of her romantic friendship with Lorena (Hick) Hickok, the heavyset, mannish Associated Press reporter who loved martinis and bourbon and cigarettes. Hick covered Mrs. Roosevelt on the campaign trail and then became her most "intimate friend," sometimes living at the White House. "E.R.'s friendship with Lorena Hickok was the most ardent and absorbing relationship of her middle years," Cook writes.
Mrs. Roosevelt believed strongly in the right of public figures to private lives. "Every human soul has its own secrets and its own right to keep them buried if it wishes," she said. But Cook, a professor of history at John Jay College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, who dedicates her book to her mother and, she says, in part to the "lives of example" of Bella Abzug and several other women, tries to draw Mrs. Roosevelt out of the Sapphic closet. She cannot say for sure that her close friendships with two lesbian couples and with Hickok were sexual, but she decides they "embraced amorosity." In the first volume, Cook, quoting a letter from Hick telling Eleanor, "I remember your eyes, with a kind of teasing smile in them, and the feeling of that soft spot just northeast of the corner of your mouth against my lips," concludes, "Sigmund Freud notwithstanding: A cigar may not always be a cigar, but the 'northeast corner of your mouth against my lips' is always the northeast corner."
THE letters, meant to help Hick write Eleanor's biography, are, Cook declaims, an "arc of love and longing, ardor and disappointment." The First Lady addressed Hick as "darling," "dear one" and "dearest," wrote "je t'aime" and "je t'adore," read poetry aloud to her when they went on holidays and confessed spurts of jealousy. She writes Hick that she missed her warmth in bed when she wasn't there, and she had to use a "sleeping bag and a hot-water bottle." She dangled the possibility that they might live together after the White House, ending one letter, "Darling, I ache for you," and another, "And I love to feel you love me just as you do & I do." She tried to pay for Hick's new Plymouth convertible, but Hick returned the check. Eleanor wrote back, "I could spank you."
Just as the press did not report or take pictures of F.D.R.'s paralyzed legs, they cut Mrs. Roosevelt some slack. They sometimes trailed her, with one Princess Di-like car chase, but she could usually get rid of them. She rented an apartment in Greenwich Village, built her own little house near her mother-in-law's house in Hyde Park, N.Y., and took off on driving holidays with Hick and other friends.
The First Lady, who also maintained a close friendship with her former bodyguard Earl Miller, eventually decided she did not want an exclusive relationship with Hick, because it interfered with her intensity about politics. "She wanted, above all, to be unconfined," Cook writes.
F.D.R. was charming to Eleanor's lady friends. Almost the only time he put his foot down about her escapades was when Eleanor wanted to drive down from New York to Washington for his first inauguration in her blue Buick convertible with Hick and the dogs. He explained she had hostess duties.
Though she immoderately admires her subject, Cook details her frosty side -- When her clear blue eyes turned to ice, warmth drained from the very walls of the room" -- and finds some flaws. She sees Mrs. Roosevelt's passive-aggressive side in the rowdy dogs she agreed to get rid of only after they lunged at several children and bit a diplomat and a senator and a reporter, and in her refusal to replace Henrietta Nesbitt, the head housekeeper in the White House, who insolently served undercooked and overcooked gruel to an epicurean President for 12 years. It got to the point where the hungry President had to order out from neighboring hotels or rely on gift baskets sent by friends. Like George Bush with his broccoli, F.D.R. made national headlines when he had a "tizzy-wizzy," as his wife put it, over watery spinach. "In anticipation of ghastly repasts," Cook writes, "some White House guests routinely dined before they arrived."
Cook finds most fault with her subject on her silence on the growing violence against Jews in Hitler's Germany: "Silence is the ultimate collusion." The First Lady had been instructed by the State Department to say nothing on other international crises. Cook can only speculate why the usually irrepressible Eleanor Roosevelt muzzled herself: "F.D.R. relied upon and required the enormous German and Catholic vote; and the support of the Southern Democrats who dominated Congress. . . . Eleanor relied on her Jewish friends, including Elinor Morgenthau and Bernard Baruch, who feared that domestic Jew-hatred would be intensified by protests against Germany's official anti-Jewish decrees. . . . Whatever the reason, the United States' determined silence of 1933-38, combined with Britain's appeasement and collaboration, allowed Hitler to believe he had no serious opponents."
Like others in the WASP hierarchy, Mrs. Roosevelt displayed a casually anti-Semitic attitude in private. Forced to attend a party for Bernard Baruch when F.D.R. was Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Eleanor wrote to her mother-in-law, "I'd rather be hung than seen at" it, since it would be "mostly Jews." Afterward, she reported back: "The Jew party was appalling. I never wish to hear money, jewels and sables mentioned again."
Her ugly comments diminished, Cook says, as her friendship with Baruch and other Jews flourished. She was grateful to Baruch because he "looks on me as a mind, not as a woman." By the time of the New Deal, she was coming around, risking criticism to meet with Jewish groups, supporting an array of Jewish causes and writing articles urging tolerance. "It is the secret fear that the Jewish people are stronger or more able than those who still wield superior physical power over them, which brings about oppression," she wrote in Liberty magazine. "I believe that those nations which do not persecute are saved only by confidence in themselves and a feeling that they can still defend themselves and their own place in the world. Therefore, I am forced to the conclusion that the Jewish people though they may be in part responsible for the present situation are not as responsible as the other races who need to examine themselves and grapple with their own fears."
Besides Hick, one of her closest friendships was with Louis Howe, F.D.R.'s brilliant, gnomish strategist. Howe taught her two great lessons: "Never admit you're licked" and "If you have to compromise, be sure to compromise up." In a letter to Hick, the First Lady said that Howe "wanted to 'make' me President when F.D.R. was through, and insisted he could do it."
In 1936, she summarized for women in public life what she had learned:
"You cannot take anything personally.
"You cannot bear grudges.
"You must finish the day's work when the day's work is done.
"You cannot get discouraged too easily.
"You have to take defeat over and over again and pick up and go on.
"Be sure of your facts.
"Argue the other side with a friend until you have found the answer to every point which might be brought up against you.
"Women who are willing to be leaders must stand out and be shot at. More and more they are going to do it, and more and more they should do it."
She added that "every woman in public life needs to develop skin as tough as rhinoceros hide."
Are you listening, Hillary?

 BODY:

Hemingway's Chair
By Michael Palin. St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.
In his first novel, a former member of Monty Python's Flying Circus tells the story of a sweet-tempered postal worker with a Papa obsession who is driven batty when his small-town post office is privatized. Last year our reviewer, Bruce Weber, praised the book's "dry, deftly understated wit," "hearty, well-formed sentences" and "clever, on-the-money dialogue."
 
Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs
By Caroline Knapp. Delta, $12.95.
This affectionate account of the author's two-year relationship with Lucille, a 45-pound shepherd mix she rescued from an animal shelter, is both an unabashed love letter and a commentary on the power of dogs to open the human heart. It's also full of canine lore, childhood memories and testimonials from many other dog owners. "Knapp's dogs come bounding to life on the page," Susan Cheever wrote in the Book Review in 1998. "They bark and paw at the covers. They watch us with bemusement and acceptance. . . . She's written a funny, instructive and completely enjoyable book."
 
Roxanna Slade
By Reynolds Price. Scribner, $13.
The narrator of this graceful, old-fashioned novel is a strong-willed Southerner in her 90's who looks back on her life's gains and losses, as well as those of our century. Last year our reviewer, Janet Burroway, called the author "a chronicler of decency, pluck and joy" who has "given us the weight and worth of the ordinary."
 
Saratoga: Turning Point of America's Revolutionary War
By Richard M. Ketchum. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15.95.
Drawing on a wide range of sources, including the diaries of officers and soldiers, the author explains why the colorful British general John Burgoyne failed in his 1777 invasion of the Colonies from Canada, and why his surrender was so critical to the war's outcome. "The strength of 'Saratoga' lies in his vivid descriptions of the rugged landscape and in his many arresting portraits of participants," Pauline Maier wrote here in 1997. The same publisher has reissued Decisive Day: The Battle for Bunker Hill ($12.95), in which Ketchum reconstructs the 1775 campaign to control the Charlestown peninsula, a bloody affair marked by confusion and wrongheadedness in both the British and American camps. "It was a furious action and a chilling spectacle," which Ketchum describes "in handsome style," Bruce Bliven Jr. wrote in these pages in 1962.
 
A Blessing on the Moon
By Joseph Skibell. Berkley, $12.
In this first novel, the spirit of a Jewish man killed in wartime Poland ascends from a mass grave to roam the countryside, guided by his murdered rabbi, who has turned into a crow. His journey "illuminates the horror of history through the energy and wisdom of fantasy and myth; scene after scene is rich with emotion, humor and invention," Patrick Giles wrote here in 1997.
 
Caging the Genies: A Workable Solution for Nuclear,
Chemical, and Biological Weapons
By Stansfield Turner. Westview, $14.
A former Director of Central Intelligence offers a detailed plan for reducing the global stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. His slender book, which has been updated, "is more than an arms-control proposal," one critic wrote in 1997. "It is a readable primer on nuclear weapons and strategy."
 
The Great Hill Stations of Asia
By Barbara Crossette. Basic Books, $15.
The United Nations bureau chief for The New York Times tours the mountaintop villages of southern Asia that were built by American and European colonialists seeking refuge from the scorching malarial summers. "The region's history, politics, religion and economics are brilliantly summarized," Alexander Frater said here last year. "Yet she also maintains a lively social curiosity." The Idea of India, by Sunil Khilnani (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $13), is a scholarly analysis focusing on the growth of the modern Indian state and the evolution of one of the world's most intensely political societies. "Khilnani writes with illuminating dexterity, wit and compassion," Judith M. Brown wrote here in 1998.
 
The Ebony Tower
By John Fowles. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.
This collection of four stories and a translation of a medieval French fable is steeped in the author's continuing fascination with the power of art to redefine the terms of human freedom. "If you haven't been reading Fowles," you'll find these tales "magical enough," Theodore Solotaroff wrote here in 1974. "If you have . . . you'll have the pleasure of making connections."
 
The Notebooks of Don Rigoberto
By Mario Vargas Llosa. Penguin, $12.95.
This wickedly promiscuous novel is about the sexual escapades of a wealthy Peruvian couple and their son -- or is it the fantasy of a bored insurance executive? "Vargas Llosa's complex, gorgeous prose . . . sweeps the reader into a rich confusion of art and fact, fiction and reality," Walter Kendrick wrote here last year.
 
The Hunger Moon
By Suzanne Matson. Ballantine, $12.
Three women of different ages find a way to soothe their loneliness and suffering when their lives intersect in a Boston suburb. In 1997 our reviewer, Sarah Lyall, admired this first novel's "crisp, clean writing" and "compassionately drawn characters." Scott Veale

HEADLINE: Deep in The Republic Of Chevron

BYLINE: By Norimitsu Onishi; Norimitsu Onishi is the West Africa bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
The delta region of southern Nigeria, where the mighty Niger River drains into the Atlantic Ocean, includes some of the most inhospitable territory on earth. It's the world's largest mangrove swamp, 14,000 square miles of thickets, channels and lagoons all but impenetrable to any but the most practiced eye. It's also oil country, dotted with wells and flow stations, where about two million barrels of crude are collected each day and piped to central stations for transport abroad.
Helicopter is the preferred mode of transport, for the lucky few who can afford it. One of those is Leonard Hutto, the superintendent of Chevron's operations in the eastern Niger Delta, and on this day it was his chopper that hovered tentatively above one of Chevron's 30-odd oil stations in the area. The landing pad, a few hundred feet below, was thronged with hundreds of angry young Nigerians peering up at the midmorning sky, clearly shouting and shaking their fists. Seeing that they did not have guns, Hutto finally told the pilot to land. 
 At the same moment, down on the flow station, standing atop a table inside a tiny office, surrounded by dozens of young men brandishing machetes, Hutto's Nigerian assistant, Tony Okoaye, was relieved to hear the helicopter's engine drown out the shouts of his captors. To hear Okoaye tell it, a predawn phone call had jerked him out of bed: 400 villagers had invaded the site, carrying with them a long list of demands. By 7 A.M. Okoaye had driven to the station, only to be taken hostage. Okoaye, an American-educated engineer normally prone to fits of delirious laughter, was not laughing. The young men, many drunk or high on marijuana, made him stand on the table for hours, slapping his pudgy frame and jabbing forefingers into the soft belly above his Tommy Hilfiger jeans. "Ah, hah!" they taunted. "You're a big man!"
They ordered him to shut down the oil wells. Okoaye did so, reluctantly. "You don't want to lose one barrel." Then they demanded to see his boss, Hutto. "We want to see the white man," they told him. "The American."
And so after a half-hour helicopter ride from Chevron's eastern headquarters in the city of Port Harcourt, the American oilman from south Texas had arrived. "What a pain," Hutto remembers thinking, as his chopper descended from the sky and the Nigerians scattered.
What came next on this particular morning would nonplus the most seasoned executive at a Fortune 500 company, but to the Chevron oilman it was Kabuki. After the youths agreed to let him call a police escort, Hutto got into a Toyota pickup and drove a few miles to the village.
There, in the shade of a huge tree, he sat on a folding chair through the afternoon, listening to the community's grievances and demands: more scholarships for its youngsters and more regular meetings with Chevron, which the locals would get, and other demands, which they would not, including 25 jobs on the spot, about $27,000 in cash and an unspecified amount for the wages they had lost while busy invading the oil station. Hutto instead slipped $50 to the town chiefs for drinks, $20 to the youths and another $20 to a group of young men who had let the air out of the tires of the Toyota -- to reinflate them.
His assistant was released, the valves were opened at the oil wells and crude began coursing through the pipelines to the flow station. A few thousand barrels had been lost.
"Not a big deal," Hutto says.
Routine, in fact, in the Niger Delta, where men usually focused on finding and extracting hydrocarbons are forced to act as politicians, diplomats and mediators. These are roles that Western oilmen are increasingly playing as they seek crude in war-ravaged and lawless places like Angola and Congo, nations in name alone. Hutto spent 12 years in Congo, the former Zaire, where frequent crises forced him to sleep on an offshore oil platform, a fortress in the Atlantic Ocean several miles from a land of chaos.
The Niger Delta is not just physically inhospitable. It is also the most combustible oil-rich corner on the planet -- simply the most difficult and dangerous assignment for an oilman. In Hutto's office, a framed black-and-white photograph hangs on the wall, a constant reminder of the price of peacekeeping in the delta. It shows Hutto standing next to some chiefs in Kula at the dedication of a $125,000 town-hall center built by Chevron.
The photograph was taken a year ago, soon after Hutto arrived in Nigeria, just in time to see the death of Gen. Sani Abacha unleash a bewildering series of events that culminated in the installation of a new civilian Government in May. In the past year, the troubles in the Niger Delta have become more evident. Its boldest residents, whose anger had been contained by Abacha's fiercely repressive dictatorship, have invaded oil stations, kidnapped workers and committed sabotage against pipelines. Last fall, the unrest slashed Nigeria's daily oil production by a third. The revolt, deadlier, more widespread and better organized than the isolated protests of previous years, led many in Nigeria to talk of a coming civil war.
All of which has transformed the simple task of pumping crude into a strange exercise in diplomacy, civics and bluff, less the oil business than an exercise in velvet-gloved imperialism. "We've gone to a situation whereby we can produce oil with our eyes closed," says Okoaye, 42, who has worked in Port Harcourt for seven years. "Dealing with those guys, that's the toughest part now."
And so the Western oil companies find themselves in the peculiar position of providing services usually met by government -- supplying electricity and water, building roads, bridges, schools and hospitals. Mostly, they have done this to stop rising public discontent from making it impossible for them to pump oil.
"The Government is supposed to do something first," says Ajumogobia Wenike, 43, a fisherman living in a town, Kula, so deep in the mangrove swamp that he has never even visited Port Harcourt, although it's only about 50 miles away. "But if government doesn't, the companies should do two and three, because they benefit from the blessings of our soil. It's what God gave us that they are tapping."
The unrest is rooted in four decades of gross state neglect. Successive military regimes dominated by Muslim northerners have kept the Niger Delta and its seven million people severely undeveloped, while enforcing few, if any, environmental standards. The generals had already, in the late 1960's, fought the bloodiest civil war in post-colonial Africa. In that conflict, the Ibo, one of the three main ethnic groups in the country, had tried to secede, form their own country, Biafra, and take the oil with them. The generals feared that economic development in the delta would inevitably beget similar separatist yearnings.
"Our responsibility, our duty, our obligation is to redress the neglect of the past," the newly elected President, Olusegun Obasanjo, said during a visit this month to the delta. This was after a new wave of violence swept the area the day after his inauguration, leaving scores of Nigerians dead. "But please, please, give us the opportunity. Give us time." For now, while the roads in the rest of the country may be bad, they are virtually nonexistent here. While the state-owned power utility supplies infrequent electricity elsewhere, its power lines do not even reach here. Not only has little of the estimated $275 billion the country has earned from oil since the mid-1970's been spent here, but $50 billion of it has just disappeared overseas, according to a United States official in Nigeria.
There is only one major road in the delta -- a 120-mile stretch linking the oil cities of Port Harcourt and Warri. The road, with soldiers stationed every few miles to preserve order, provides sometimes grotesque scenes of misery. When a crater-size pothole forces me to stop my car, men and women wearing rags and straw hats surge forward and prostrate themselves on the road. The supplicants, my driver explains, are escapees from a local leper colony.
I am heading east to Port Harcourt, to meet Hutto at Chevron's offices in a walled-off compound of white one-story buildings. I find him standing under the canopy of the main entrance, dragging on a Marlboro and chatting with traditional leaders from the communities near Chevron's oil sites. The chiefs drop by one after the other, as they do every day Hutto is here. Overall, he says, he now spends at least 60 percent of his time on community relations.
Damian Obiagu, a chief in a town called Izombe, buttonholes Hutto: "Please, I have just dropped a letter for you. If they have been working on my land, I want them to employ -- I have dropped the letter in the office. So you have to tell them."
"Yeah, we'll talk," Hutto says.
"Yes, thank you very much," the chief says, leaving. "Yes, thank you veeeeery much."
The chief's words may be disjointed, but his message is clear. A Chevron contractor has been doing some work at an oil well, and the chief is pressing Hutto to make the contractor hire local youths as casuals. In all likelihood, ghost workers will be hired. "They don't show up for work," Hutto explains. "You don't want them to. You don't want a person on a jack-up barge or drilling rig who doesn't know anything about safety."
But the ghost workers serve an important purpose. They allow the chief to claim he has won jobs for his people and the oil company to say it has hired from the community. The fiction is necessary because it is virtually impossible to find qualified oil workers among the delta residents. Sometimes, though, one party does not stick to his lines. Chevron awarded Obiagu a contract to provide "security" at one of the wells. But one day, displeased with Chevron, the chief's men invaded the well. "No, no, Damian, you don't understand," Hutto recalls telling the chief. "You're our security contractor, to protect us. You're not looking to threaten us. 'Oh! oh!' he said. He's a nice old man."
Since taking over Gulf Oil in 1984, Chevron has pumped many billions of dollars' worth of oil in Nigeria, 418,000 barrels a day in 1998. In 1998, Chevron Corporation's total worldwide revenues amounted to $30.6 billion; Nigeria's gross national product was estimated by the World Bank to be $30.7 billion in 1997. Nigeria's G.N.P., while a pittance alongside the West's economies, is one of Africa's biggest.
Kingdom Dateme, the king of a town called Idama, also finds Hutto under the canopy. "Our Government cannot assist us for anything," the king tells me. "So, in effect, we now make all our demands on Chevron. Your own state cannot do anything for you. Your local governments cannot provide something for you. We are now like father and son. Are you getting me? I can even come here at 6 o'clock, 8 P.M. or 8 A.M. I can simply come."
"You must help me, your people," Hutto tells him.
"I'm creating the enabling atmosphere for you," the king says.
In return, Chevron is building a science laboratory for the town's secondary school. But to insure the loyalty of the king and other traditional leaders, Chevron awards them personal contracts, to provide security or, more typically, to supply the office with bottled water and office materials. "It's better than to just give them money," Hutto says after the king has left. "I'd rather see them work for it."
The king has been pushing for a bigger personal contract, Hutto tells his assistant, Okoaye, who has come outside. "He wants a contract so that he can get a big house now," Hutto says.
"In his village?" Okoaye asks.
"No, here.'
"Here in P.H.?" Okoaye laughs, adding, "That guy, he's something else, eh?"
"He's looking for a half-million, million Naira contract," Hutto says, the equivalent of $5,000 to $10,000. "With those he can buy his own big house here."
Okoaye laughs uproariously, before adding with some finality, "He's a pig."
Then softening up a bit, Okoaye asks his boss: "But he doesn't really make trouble for you. He doesn't really bother you, does he? He's just greedy."
"Well," Hutto says, "they're all greedy."
After work, Hutto drives home in his white Toyota Landcruiser through Port Harcourt's "go slows," or traffic jams. Boys hawking everything from toilet paper to power tools dart to his side with cries of "Master!" But they turn away quickly: a Nigerian policeman, gripping a tear-gas rifle in his hands, rides shotgun.
More policemen guard Hutto's villa, a two-story white house. Never married, Hutto lives alone, not counting the houseboy in the backyard bungalow. In the kitchen, Hutto shows me a large refrigerator and freezer. He keeps inside the 50 New York sirloin and T-bone steaks that he brought back from his last visit to the United States and has been cooking, at the rate of one a week, on a grill that he keeps in his living room.
He drops off his briefcase and gets ready for a visit to an expat bar called Cheers. As Hutto pulls out of his driveway, a skinny African dog watches indifferently. When he moved in, Hutto explains, the houseboy told him that the previous tenant had left the dog behind.
"Now it's yours," Hutto told the houseboy.
Hutto, 43, grew up in the small town of Taft in south Texas, watching his father and grandfather supplement their farmers' incomes by working in oil fields. Hutto got a degree in petroleum engineering at Texas A&M, then joined Chevron and worked in west Texas and the company's headquarters in San Francisco. But it was the Congo that hardened him for battle. Like many expatriate oilmen in Africa, he worked nonstop for 28 days, then went home for 28 days, in his case to a ranch-style house in Las Vegas.
"I was there to make money," Hutto says of the Congo, and explains one trick. During his trips home, he would go to a Kmart and buy cheap wristwatches on sale and sell them for a mark-up to the Congolese. "And these guys, they would just see the original price sticker," he says. "The same guys would come to me in three months for another watch, so I knew they were reselling them. I was just getting my cut."
A year ago, Hutto accepted the assignment in Port Harcourt, a position Chevron considers difficult to fill because there is no rotation schedule, no other Americans and constant interaction with Chevron's delta neighbors. In Lagos, the Americans live inside Chevron's headquarters, a sprawling campus surrounded by high walls, a surreal replica of America with wide streets and suburban houses straight out of Westchester County. Here, Hutto is alone.
And to the thousands in the delta, Leonard Hutto is Chevron Oil.
For years, the oil companies ignored the squalid conditions in the delta, content to pump oil and get their profits out. But they were forced to change their approach, particularly after 1995. General Abacha's regime hanged the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa after he demanded reparations for his Ogoni people, who remained impoverished despite the long presence of Royal Dutch/Shell in their region. Nigeria became an international pariah; Shell, the biggest producer in the country, suffered a public-relations black eye. Shell began a review of its relations with its host communities, and the other companies increased their community contributions.
But violence has risen and taken on different forms. The deadliest has been fighting among the delta's ethnic groups, competing against one another for jobs or claims to oil-rich areas. The Nigerian military has also engaged in battles with rioters, and the oil companies have been criticized for their coziness with the military. A recent report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch says the oil companies have looked away whenever the military has brutalized or killed protesters. In Chevron's case, Human Rights Watch says that twice in the last year the military used Chevron boats and helicopters to crack down on protesters. Four villagers were killed in one incident, according to the organization.
Chevron, like the other oil companies, argues that its hands are tied in these situations. The companies are minority partners in joint ventures with the Government and say they cannot refuse any requests by the military to use equipment leased by the joint venture. What's more, the companies point out, their workers have often been hurt. In December, six of Chevron's Nigerian employees were kidnapped and are presumed dead.
For Hutto, keeping peace in the town of Kula has been especially hard. At Chevron's quarterly meeting in Kula, the number of chiefs invariably increases, which means more contracts to hand out and more money to spread around. "Most Kula people are greedy; most of the chiefs are greedy," Hutto says. "They want money all the time. Money, money, money, money."
But, he says, he will stick with this job, maybe for another two or three years. An overseas assignment has always been good for an oilman's career, but especially so nowadays when Chevron is increasing the number of its positions overseas. And he reckons that he makes about 50 percent more than an executive at an equal level in the United States.
After several Heinekens at Cheers, we go to Charlie's, a restaurant for well-to-do Nigerians. Hutto flirts with Phyllis, the waitress, but complains when she brings him only two prawns on a platter. The food has been going downhill since Sylvia left; Sylvia always brought him three prawns. It is not 10 P.M. yet, but it is time to go home. Early morning. Lots of work. And Kula, always Kula.
"He always leaves early," the host says, "before the pretty girls come."
Unreachable by road, Kula lies on the Atlantic coast, a two- to three-hour trip aboard a twin-engine boat from Port Harcourt, through a maze of swampy creeks that appear indistinguishable from one another. There are two other ways to get there: a 30-minute flight aboard a helicopter, which the oil companies use, or a big, slow, aging boat that takes about nine hours and is used by most people here.
Not too far north of Kula, one Chevron and three Shell stations pump tens of thousands of barrels of oil a day. In the creeks around Kula, children paddle by themselves in dugout canoes, cruising past mangrove trees that dig their sinister-looking roots, spiderlike, into the soft shore. On the waterfront, a Government-built concrete jetty is sinking into the river, seemingly ready to collapse at any moment. A stone's throw from there, the blackened and rotting pillars of a new Government jetty that was never finished are slowly giving way to the waves. Kula consists of a town center surrounded by scores of fishing settlements of mud-and-thatch houses. In the center, simple wood houses with dirt or concrete floors and zinc roofs are packed around narrow dirt alleyways. Open sewers, reeking of stagnant green refuse, crisscross the area.
In other words, Kula is a typical delta town. The only medical facility for a population estimated at more than 40,000 is a three-bed dispensary in a squat concrete building constructed decades ago by the British, Nigeria's former colonial rulers. Its three primary schools and one secondary school have stood empty for the last four months, since the teachers, who had not been paid in months, went on strike. Electricity is provided by a generator that is maintained by Shell. It is turned on around 7 P.M. and switched off around 6 A.M. Chevron built the only paved road. At Kula's request, Chevron is now constructing staff quarters and dormitories for the secondary school, projects that were begun but abandoned by the Government in the early 1980's. Overall in Nigeria, Chevron reports spending $30 million from 1994 to 1998 in community-development projects.
The projects are agreed on during meetings between Chevron and the Kula chiefs. Because the Kula chiefs spend most of their time in Port Harcourt, the meetings are never actually conducted in Kula. And usually the meetings are held over catered lunches.
"Free food!" Hutto says.
Typically, the Kula chiefs make requests of Chevron and, to keep the peace, the oil company agrees to them -- if the projects fall within budget. It does this even with projects that are patently unsound. For instance, Hutto says, Chevron warned against paving a road through a wet area, but the chiefs insisted. Now the road has collapsed. Another strategy to keep Kula and the other communities happy, Hutto says, is to drag out construction of projects, so that Chevron is almost always building something in each community, reaping the political rewards.
In Chief Anthony Opuari's house hangs the same photograph of the town-hall ribbon-cutting ceremony that hangs in Hutto's office. "Leonard Hutto is a kind man," says Opuari, who is Kula's senior chief. "He is always listening to our problems."
But away from the town center, next to a fishing bay in a cluster of shacks made of driftwood, the cozy relations between the oil companies and the chiefs kindle fires of resentment. "The chiefs punish us, combining with Shell and Chevron not to develop this town," says Dokubo Obene, 27, who is wearing a Michael Jordan T-shirt but says he has never heard of the basketball star. "When they want to develop this town, the chiefs collect the money as bribes." Obene belongs to a group that calls itself Chevron Youths. Its members, who squat on a piece of land across the river from the Chevron oil station, demanded a $2,000 "development" fee so that they could build a house.
Hutto has never heard of the Chevron Youths, though he does not doubt their existence. He knows that most residents of Kula say the oil companies have not done enough and accuse their leaders of selling them out. He admits that the Kula people are "probably right" that the chiefs are embezzling money. But the oil companies have no choice, he says, but to deal with leaders selected by the communities. "We can't start meddling with internal politics. You have to stay outside the boundaries of the community."
The chiefs routinely barge into Okoaye's office, greedily eying, for instance, the Chevron pen on his desk. "They take it!" Okoaye says, making a swiping movement with his arm. "Oh, I like it!' You try to be a nice guy, because those few things can count in the future. When you get into trouble, you want them to be there to help you."
Behind his cynicism, however, Okoaye conveys a passionate sense of mission. He is a Nigerian who chose to return home from the United States, not on a lucrative expat's salary but on the far-smaller wage of a local hire. Educated overseas, married at one time to an American woman and a member of the Yoruba, the most highly educated group among Nigeria's 110 million people, Okoaye is nearly as much a stranger as Hutto is to the people from the swamps and creeks.
"Sometimes maybe the oil companies are too rigid," he says. "The oil companies should reach out to people in the villages, who genuinely live in the villages, maybe some religious leaders."
The chiefs maintain that by living in Port Harcourt they can lobby the oil companies more effectively. Besides, some of them work as civil servants there. When I first meet Opuari, he demands a "courtesy call" of 100,000 Naira, about $1,000, for an interview. He assures me the proceeds will be spread out among all the chiefs. The price drops gradually, all the way to $100, until he drops the subject altogether after half an hour.
"I asked Chevron for assistance to finish my house," Opuari says, referring to a concrete house he has been building in Kula. "But no assistance." The people of Kula wonder, though, how Opuari, a low-ranking civil servant with a secondary-school education, can afford a house in Port Harcourt, one in Kula and now a third one.
It is Saturday night in Kula. The town center sinks under a haze of smoke from countless small fires and the flicker of individual lamps. The brightest light in Kula, shining even brighter than the full moon on this night, is a Shell flow station's gas flare a few miles north. The flare lights up the sky with an orange tint, making the whiteness of the clouds eerily visible at midnight.
When I drop by unannounced at Kula's Anglican church on Sunday morning, a lay leader is delivering a sermon from the Acts of the Apostles. She reads the story of the couple, Ananias and Sapphira, who sell a piece of land and keep part of the proceeds for themselves. "But Peter said, 'Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land?"'
In Kula, everyone believes his neighbors to be Ananias and Sapphira. The alienation from the community, from traditional authority, has made Kula a fertile ground for increasingly desperate actions, especially takeovers of oil stations. About a year ago, 25 youths were jailed after invading a Chevron oil rig. Shell, which has three stations and an extremely strained relationship with Kula, experienced an average of two shutdowns a month last year. Last month, 50 young men invaded a Shell station and closed it for five days, for a loss of 134,050 barrels of oil, worth about $2.4 million.
The takeovers are evidence that Kula's traditional social structure has collapsed, says Matthew Alabo, 40. A businessman born in Kula and one of the few to have been educated abroad, in London, Alabo returned last year to try to restore order in the largest fishing settlement in Kula. He has made some strides, helping depose a corrupt chief and organizing an election to select a successor.
The town's more successful men now jockey to be on the council of chiefs so that they can deal directly with the oil companies, Alabo says. While chiefs were once chosen for their wisdom, you can now buy a seat on the council for about $500, if one of your ancestors was a recognized chief; about $1,000 otherwise. Accordingly, the number of chiefs has risen from 5 to 18 in the last two years alone.
Young men mill around the oil operations, demanding that contractors pay a $100 "landing" or "youth" fee to pass through a certain creek, waiting for a spill to demand compensation or, Alabo says, causing sabotage. "Even if you are 12 years old, you don't want to stay behind and watch what others have come to give you," Alabo says. "Everyone wants his piece directly."
The same, naturally, can be said about all of Nigeria. If Nigeria is the story of Ananias and Sapphira told a thousand times, from its top military rulers all the way down to a chief in Kula, only the dollar amount needs adjustment.
On the boat back from Kula to Port Harcourt, a violent storm breaks suddenly. The bow, the mangrove trees, the creeks, the muddy river beds, the gas flares of the oil stations, all of the Niger Delta vanishes in the rain. Will President Obasanjo's pleas for time and another chance be heeded? Will he push through policies to reform the entrenched system of corruption and pay-offs? Or will the angriest people of the delta grow ever more angry? And will they be emboldened -- now that civilians, not soldiers, rule the country -- to create more disorder?
At Chevron's office in Port Harcourt, Hutto and Okoaye are standing outside under the canopy on a rainy morning. Hutto's voice is raspy, sore from several days of negotiating for the release of an American worker. The worker, "a big guy from Alabama," took his boat up a canal near Chevron's oil station in Kula to check on a well when half a dozen young men jumped him. The worker spent nine days in the mangrove swamp with his captors pointing guns at his head. After a $25,000 ransom is paid, the Alabama man is released.
"I don't know how we'll operate," Okoaye says, worried that such incidents will rise under the new civilian Government. "I don't know, because security is going to be a big problem."
Hutto rubs his forefinger and thumb together.
"Sometimes it doesn't go far enough, money alone," Okoaye says. "Yeah, spend more money?"
"Spend more money."
"Keep them quiet? Make them happy?"
"Yup."

HEADLINE: A Patel Motel Cartel?

BYLINE: By Tunku Varadarajan; Tunku Varadarajan is a writer based in New York. His last article for the magazine was about cricket.

 BODY:
'You're getting the last room in Huntsville," the man at the front desk rasped. I was in the heart of a certain kind of Texas -- the kind I'd probably only visit in pursuit of a story -- and the room was a godsend. I thanked the man and we shook hands -- not a gesture you often see enacted between owner and customer at the front desk of an Econo Lodge. But he was Indian and so am I, and it was our little way of touching base.
This was two years ago. As I was then new to America, I asked him bluntly what on earth had brought him to a place like Huntsville. My naked curiosity amused him. "Why shouldn't I be here?" he said. Indians like him were everywhere, especially in places like Huntsville. Go 15 miles west and you'd find a motel run by his cousin. Ninety miles south and there was another cousin in another motel. An uncle had a place, too, somewhere in Georgia. Wherever there was a motel in the United States, he said -- and I mistook this assertion for hyperbole -- there were likely to be people from India running it. The statement, I learned later, was not all that far from the truth. 
 America's motels constitute what could be called a nonlinear ethnic niche: a certain ethnic group becomes entrenched in a clearly identifiable economic sector, working at jobs for which it has no evident cultural, geographical or even racial affinity.
I don't mean Italians owning pizzerias, or Japanese people running judo schools. I mean, to use an obvious example, the Korean dominance of the deli-and-grocery sector in New York -- a city where the Chinese run most laundries and Sri Lankans, in case you didn't know this, run most porn-video stores. Or the Arabs in greater Detroit, who have a stranglehold on gas stations, or the Vietnamese who monopolize nail salons in Los Angeles. Farther afield, I could mention London's taxi drivers, sharp-tongued in their big black cars, many of whom are Jews from the city's East End; or the security guards outside New Delhi's more affluent residences, virtually all of whom are Nepalese; or the prostitutes in the United Arab Emirates, who are so often women from Russia.
According to the latest figures from the Asian American Hotel Owners Association (A.A.H.O.A.), slightly more than 50 percent of all motels in the United States are now owned by people of Indian origin. Pull off any Interstate highway and look for a cheap bed for the night and there is a better-than-even chance that the motel you will curl up in belongs to Indians. (Looking at the broader spectrum of all hotels of any sort in the United States -- from trendy boutique hotels in Manhattan to mom-and-pop outfits in the boondocks -- almost 37 percent are owned by Indians.) If you bear in mind that Indians constitute less than 1 percent of America's population, the conquest of this economic niche appears extraordinary.
Look a bit closer and the picture is even more arresting: about 70 percent of all Indian motel owners -- or a third of all motel owners in America -- are called Patel, a surname that indicates they are members of a Gujarati Hindu subcaste. "There's a thing our parents tell everyone, so don't yawn if you've heard it already," says Mit Amin, an urbane 39-year-old who owns the Beverly Hills Inn, a chic bed-and-breakfast in the Buckhead section of Atlanta. "In some American small towns they think 'Patel' is an Indian word for 'motel.' Can you blame them? As for me, I'm glad I'm called Amin. Wouldn't you want to be called Brown if the rest of the world was called Smith?"
Patels and Amins, however, are not as far apart as Smiths and Browns might be. They share the same slot in the elaborate Indian caste structure, with its four principal castes and myriad subcastes: they are both vaishyas, or traders, who were once employed to calculate the tithes that were owed to medieval kings by farmers in Gujarat, an Indian state on the Arabian Sea, where their origins lie. Most Indians believe that these people have commerce in their blood. And the Patels themselves seem to believe it, too.
'Patels are maybe the shrewdest businesspeople in the world," chuckled Lata Patel, who with her husband, Pankaj ("Call me P.J."), runs the Budget Inn in Jasper, Ga., a mountain town of some 3,000 mostly white inhabitants about an hour's drive from Atlanta. Lata, 44, is winsome and lively; when dressed in a formal silk sari she must surely be the most glamorous woman in Jasper. Theirs is a plain little motel, built in the local architectural vernacular, with a gently sloping gray slate roof, a facade of muted pink and a well-tended grass verge. At the time of my midmorning visit, Lata was in slacks and a shirt, addressing a female client as "honey" and buzzing about the front desk with instructions for a dozy young cleaner.
This modest motel is where Lata and P.J. say they've found their "American dream" -- a phrase they used often, and unselfconsciously. But why? Why did they, and thousands of other Patels in America, seek their fortune in the lodging niche? Why not hardware stores, pet shops, drugstores?
Hasmukh P. Rama, 51, is the chairman of the American Hotel and Motel Association, the trade group representing America's $85.6 billion lodging industry. Rama is tiny, only 5 feet 3 inches tall, and his pate is as smooth as a brand-new cricket ball. His surname used to be Patel, but the family decided to adopt a new one "because Patel, as you can see, is a very common name." He is the first Asian to head the 89-year-old organization, and at a recent Indian hoteliers' convention in Atlanta he worked the room like a politician at a rally. Rama seemed like the man who could explain the motel-Patel phenomenon. But his answers to my questions, it turned out, seemed more calculated to promote a certain myth that successful hotel-owning Indians have begun to spin for public consumption.
"You must know the ancient Sanskrit phrase, Atithi devo bhava -- The guest is God.' Hospitality is in our culture," he told me. "It comes naturally to us. It is inherent in the nature of the Indian. It is natural for us to be in the lodging sector." If that is so, I asked, how was it that hardly any of these people ran hotels before they came to America? "It's all about opportunity and example," Rama replied sagely, starting into a speech about hard work. He related how he arrived in America in 1969 and noticed how "our people" were buying motels; by 1973, he had bought one himself. Now his company, JHM Enterprises, operates 23 hotels in six states and one in India. Last year, his family created the Rama Scholarship Fund for the American Dream, with a donation of $1,000,001. (Hindus consider gifts of money ending in the numeral 1 to be especially auspicious.) The benefaction is intended to help students from minorities go to schools for hotel management.
It's an inspiring tale, and Rama seems to want me to multiply it by many thousands to explain the Indian dominance of the motel business. But it isn't quite that simple. "If you look at an example of a domination of an economic niche by an ethnic group," says Thomas Espenshade, a professor of sociology at the Office of Population Research at Princeton University, "the general story is told in terms of the pioneers and the followers. This is so whether you look at Indian motel owners, Korean grocers, Chinese laundries."
In this instance, the very earliest years are hazy. But the first Indian motel owner in the United States is said to have been an illegal immigrant named Kanjibhai Desai, who managed to buy the Goldfield Hotel in downtown San Francisco in the early 1940's. By the end of that decade, there was still only a handful of Indian-owned motels, one of them owned by Bhulabhai Vanmalibhai Patel -- whose grandson Pramod Patel is today a hotelier in the Bay Area; his company's portfolio includes Holiday Inns, Ramadas and Comfort Inns.
According to Pramod, his grandfather left his Gujarati village in 1949, at the age of 29, for a better life in America. "Only 100 Indians a year were allowed into the country in those days," says Pramod. "My grandfather came, met Desai and decided to copy him. So he leased the Auburn Hotel in downtown San Francisco that same year."
By the 1960's, Pramod estimates, there were still only 60 or 70 Indian-owned motels, mostly in California. Evolving immigration laws helped the next wave of pioneers make their mark in the 1970's. At the time, explains David Mumford, the president of Mumford Company, a hotel brokerage in Newport News, Va., "many American motel owners, people I call Mr. and Mrs. Jones, were aging. Motels were a postwar thing, and by the mid-70's a lot of the people who owned them were of retiring age. Their kids were not interested in the business." The concurrent global oil crisis meant people were taking fewer driving vacations, which hurt the motel business. Property prices were depressed. "By the late 1970's and early 1980's, hundreds of motels were up for sale," Mumford continues.
So why were these Indians attracted to them? I got a more prosaic answer to that question from Vilpesh Patel, the owner of the 85-room Flamingo Inn in Windsor, Conn. "Technically, it's easy to run. You don't need fluent English, just the will to work long hours," he says. "And it's a business that comes with a house -- you don't have to buy a separate house. Another important thing," he adds, "is the cash flow. We like that." Vilpesh was a plain-speaker. True, the guest is God. But the guest is also gold -- gold enough for Indian motel ownership to spiral upward, year by year.
Buying a motel, even one that's in the red, usually requires a substantial down payment, one beyond the reach of most new immigrants. That, however, is one key to how this particular niche was captured. The down payment was seldom a problem for a prospective Indian purchaser, who was often able to turn to a network of relatives and friends to help him out. The story of Lata and P.J., for example, is not exactly the hardscrabble tale associated with some immigrant groups.
Following an arranged marriage in 1976 in the Gujarati town of Nadiad, they left for the United States, but not out of desperation or a lack of options at home. They left behind enviable social status; their families employed cooks, watchmen, sweepers, a chauffeur. P.J.'s family owned a marble mine. "We had a comfortable life in India," he says. They simply wanted independence -- freedom from the web of their extended family, with its pressures to share and to conform -- and the simple pleasure of living as a nuclear family. In 1991, the Jasper motel's owner (also an Indian) offered P.J. the place for $150,000; the couple cobbled together the $20,000 down payment from their own savings and loans from friends and family. "It was not hard for us to do."
All of this is not to suggest that the road was an easy one. A significant number of motel owners have come not directly from India but from East Africa. The British brought thousands of Indians to their colonies there in the last century to serve as laborers and traders. They stayed on and flourished economically after these colonies won their independence. But the political and racial tensions of postcolonial Africa made nomads of them yet again. About 70,000 were expelled from Uganda by Gen. Idi Amin in 1972, and the majority resettled in Britain. In time, many would move to the United States, joining an unusual wave of well-educated Indian immigrants to this country that had begun in the mid-1960's -- doctors, academics and professionals -- and peaked in the late 1980's. By then, Indian immigrants were predominantly nonprofessionals.
Vilpesh Patel's father, Jayantibhai, was one of those who had to migrate against his will. He used to be a prosperous dry-goods merchant in Lira, a town in central Uganda. In 1972, when Jayantibhai was 32, Idi Amin ordered the confiscation of all Asian property, stripping the owners of their Ugandan nationality. After a few months in a refugee camp in Austria, where he was separated from his wife and young children, Jayantibhai Patel ended up working as a bus conductor in London. Things changed for the family in 1989. Responding to the urgings of relatives, Jayantibhai moved with his family to America. "With some help from my uncles," says his son Vilpesh, "and with the money we had from selling our house in London, Dad bought a motel."
In the earlier days of the motel phenomenon, Indians tended mostly to buy mom-and-pop establishments. "They liked the independence," Vilpesh Patel told me. "We Patels, we Gujaratis, we don't like working for other people." But there were other, less romantic factors keeping Indians out of the franchise motel chains. According to Mit Amin, an independent hotelier himself, "The big brands didn't really want us."
Indeed, there was a time when Indians were the underdogs of the lodging sector. Mike Patel, the industry-relations chairman of the A.A.H.O.A., explains that some insurance companies thought Patels were scam artists who bought, insured and burned down the property and cashed in. He says that after a couple of fires in Tennessee in the early 1980's, Indian moteliers had trouble getting insurance coverage. The association was formed, he adds, "in response to that prejudice." It began with 160 members.
The first generation of Indian hotel owners, in a manner consistent with many an emergent immigrant group, scrimped, went without, darned old socks and never took a holiday. They did this not merely to save money, but also because thrift is part of a larger moral framework, one that regards all nonessential expenditure as wasteful and unattractive. It's an attitude buttressed by a puritanical aversion to frills and frivolities, one that has its roots as much in the kind of Hinduism that the Patels practice as in their historical tradition as commercial perfectionists. You can hear it in Lata Patel's description of the work that went into updating and improving her property on the road to quadrupling its annual business.
Today, the A.A.H.O.A. has 5,000 names on its rolls, plus seven full-time staff members and an annual budget of $4.5 million. The market value of properties owned by association members is $38 billion. They pay $725 million a year in property taxes and employ 800,000 people. "The hotel establishment once didn't want to know about us," chortles Amin. "But now we are the establishment."
That kind of success has, inevitably, bred resentment in some quarters. In some parts of the rural South, white competitors have been known to add a potent and less-than-subtle phrase to their motel signs: "American-Owned." Many of the Indian owners I spoke with acknowledge that they are aware of such attitudes, but add pragmatically, as Mike Patel puts it, they "have learned to live with that sort of prejudice."
"It doesn't get us down," he insists. "If we survived Idi Amin, a couple of redneck motel owners aren't going to bother us much. In any case, our motels are American-owned, too. We're Patels, and Americans."
Pride in the conquest of a niche has for some evolved into a curious and not very enlightened machismo. Again and again these owners will boast that they got ahead by working harder than anyone else. A senior figure in the "Indian motel brotherhood" -- his words -- puts it this way: "O.K. So your Koreans work hard. Your Chinese work hard. I'd even say that some other ethnic groups work hard, on a good day. But absolutely no one works as hard as we do. I don't want to make a racial thing out of this, but there isn't anyone who can match us for effort, dedication, stamina on the job."
This Braggadocio aside, what else has kept other hard-working immigrant groups from breaking into the clearly lucrative motel sector? For starters, other groups have muscled in -- Taiwanese innkeepers in Southern California, Iraqi Christian motel owners in the Detroit area -- just not in such great numbers. The most significant reason early on was probably a combination of the idea that the motel sector didn't look terribly attractive when Indians started buying in, and those who were buying were able to assemble unusual amounts of cash from an extended group of relatives and friends. The unique kinship ties in the group unquestionably help in other ways -- for instance, a kind of bush-telegraph network of Indian moteliers often relays breaking news of properties for sale to other members of the same community, observes Mike Patel.
Eventually, the mere perception of dominance becomes self-fulfilling. A number of moteliers to whom I spoke said that white American hotel brokers would often sound out Indians first if they have a property up for sale. Mumford, who has been in the brokerage business for 21 years, said that this was "completely natural, given the track record of the Asian Indians." His company has a database of more than 7,000 "buyer-and-seller prospects" -- about 1 in 4 of whom have Patel as their surname.
"When we have a motel that comes up for sale, my team sorts the questions and decides who a prospective buyer might be. If it's a motel with less than 60 rooms, the likely buyers we identify will be Indian 98 times out of 100," he told me. "And why not? They run them better than anyone else."
Such is the world that now works to the benefit of Mit Amin, the bed-and-breakfast owner in Atlanta, who is the modern face of the Indian hotelier. He grew up in Manchester, in the north of England, where his parents moved from Kenya in 1964. His father came to America and bought a motel in 1982, but Amin himself was reluctant to leave his then home, London. Finally he gave in, moving to Hickory, N.C., to manage one of his family's properties. "It was Hicksville," he tells me. "I kid you not, mate -- the whole town sat out on the porch in rocking chairs."
Nevertheless, in 1990 he purchased the Beverly Hills Inn in Buckhead for $713,000. "The guy wanted $100,000 down payment. I got $50,000 from my dad and $50,000 from my in-laws. The place is now worth about $2 million." Amin works hard -- sometimes 15 hours a day" -- but to tool around Buckhead with him in his shiny black Mercedes convertible is to see the older, frugal ways giving way to a distinctly Western joie de vivre.
"Why not?" he asks. "I like to live well, to spend money. It's not an extravagant life style. I'm enjoying the fruits, but I'm not stripping the garden bare!" He also owns another Mercedes and a BMW -- as well as a Rolls-Royce. "An old-fashioned Patel would say, Why so many cars? But I'm just enjoying my achievements, right? It's a generation thing," he says. "My dad never went out to dinner, never indulged himself. He saved every penny. That's how he had $50,000 to give me.
"I'll tell you something, though," Amin adds. "If my dad had enjoyed the fruits of his labor, I'd have been in trouble. Big trouble."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
A Strong Dollar Means Savings in Europe

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
PACK up and get going. Europe is cheap. And don't be troubled by the new single currency, the euro. Think in marks, francs, lire, pesetas and escudos and you will see what a bargain the Continent is.
Compared with last summer, if the dollar stays where it is now, travel on the Continent should cost 4 to 5 percent less, based on the shift in the exchange rate and assuming local prices have not risen. In some countries, like Italy, the dollar has not been able to buy as many lire since 1985. 
 A double room with spa treatments and meals at La Reserve in Caramanico, Italy, near Pescara, costs $242 a person a night, down 14 percent from last October, when the dollar was at its recent low against the lira.
The muscular dollar is a result of two forces: the continued strength of the American economy and the surprising weakness in continental Europe, especially in the region's biggest economy, Germany.
And there are analysts who think the dollar's strength will last long enough to make traveling this summer even more attractive. "We expect the dollar to continue to rally," said Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign-exchange strategist at BankBoston.
In Italy, Portugal and Spain, the dollar has not been as strong as it is now since the end of 1985, its high point against European currencies since the early 1970's, when fixed exchange rates were abandoned. At the end of last month, the dollar fetched 1,866 lire, beating the 1997 high of 1,839.50 and not all that far from the 1,900 to 2,000 lire to the dollar a tourist could get in 1985.
In Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands the dollar is on the verge of buying more currency than it has since 1989, when it began a swoon that would take it to post World War II lows by 1995.
The dollar bought 1.900 German marks and 6.373 French francs in early June, the most since the fall of 1989. The dollar has slipped a little since, but it will take only a small rally to reclaim 1989 highs.
So much attention has been paid to the surprising weakness of the new euro that the extent of the benefits for the American traveler has been missed.
The euro, which was introduced in January, has plunged 11 percent to $1.037. And each slip has made the dollar's historical strength against the old currencies greater.
But this rally should be kept in context. Even in Italy, Portugal and Spain, where the dollar is at 14-year highs, it is still only 1.4 percent stronger than it was at its recent high in 1997. So if you were in Europe that year, the savings may not seem as fabulous.
When you take advantage of the stronger dollar, you will get most of the breaks in the old currencies. While the euro is the single currency now of Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Finland and Luxembourg, the new euro bills and coins do not begin to circulate until the beginning of 2002. So when you are getting cash or paying in cash, it will still be the old currencies. Prices will be listed in the old currencies and, in some cases, also the new euro.
Your credit card, however, will be charged in euros, but that should not create any difficulties because the charges will be translated into dollars when you get your bill, and you will spend the same number of dollars for something priced in euros or the old local currency.
But when you are choosing between using cash or your credit card, you can think like a foreign-exchange trader. If you want to bet that the dollar rally is going to continue, it is better to use your credit card. Because it takes time for the charge to go through, if the dollar is rallying you will get a better exchange rate. If you use cash, you are locking in the exchange rate right then.
And when you leave Euroland (the name for the countries joined by the new euro), the dollar story is different.
While the dollar rally is also making London cheaper this summer (about 3 percent), the American currency has been in a general down trend against the British pound since 1994. This summer it costs almost 3 percent more to stay in a hotel in London, based on the exchange rate difference, than it did in 1994.
In Switzerland, the dollar has just rallied back to the level of last summer. But the jump in value -- 17 percent -- since the dollar's low in October 1998 is the strongest of any major European currency. So for anyone who planned their summer in Switzerland last winter, it will cost a lot less.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
National Parks May Be Roomier

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
FOR those eager to see national-park attractions they have been reluctant to tackle, from Old Faithful at Yellowstone to the Grinnell Glacier at Glacier Park, from the Sequoias in California to Acadia in Maine, this is a particularly fortunate year. Getting in may be less of a problem than in past years.
The national park system, after years of increases in numbers of visitors, expects a leveling-off this year, to a mere 286.6 million, virtually the same as in 1998. 
 The head of Amfac Parks and Resorts of Colorado, which operates the lodges at the Grand Canyon as well as in Everglades and other popular national parks, says this flat rate -- and an already apparent drop in visits to parks in the Southwest -- is due to a decline in tourists from Asia, to a perception that the parks are overcrowded, and possibly to confusion about future changes in automobile access at the Grand Canyon.
About 15 percent of park visitors are from other countries, and these travelers are a function of the American economy, said David Barna, a spokesman for the National Park Service. "We are not a cheap visit anymore," he said, and that is what tourists are seeking at a time of recession in Asia and economic problems in northern Europe.
Foreign visitors have always focused on the best-known national parks. As Mr. Barna said, when tour organizers try to tell foreigners that the less-crowded parks might be interesting or fun, they usually respond: "When you come to Paris, you do not want to go see other towers. you want to see the Eiffel Tower."
Thus the drop in international visitors affects the iconic parks most: Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite. Grand Canyon recorded 5 million visitors in 1997; that dropped 11 percent in 1998 and is expected to fall another 6 percent this year, to under 4.2 million. This year Yellowstone is expected to drop 3.5 percent and Yosemite 1.9 percent.
Not every park will be gasping for business, because in many places the pressure is still climbing. But a burst of repairs and additions to hotels, coupled with slowed demand, meant that late in June, reservations at the major park hotels were still showing an average of 10 percent availability for July and August.
That softness does not apply to campsite reservations. The company that handles phone and Internet camping and recreational-vehicle reservations at the busiest parks said that reservations were holding steady against last year. One sales representative said that campgrounds wouldn't be hit by a fall in foreign tourists because they are usually booked into park hotels rather than campgrounds.
Here is a roundup of changes in national parks this year, including a report on the impact of fires at Joshua Tree National Park in California.
 
Yellowstone's New Rooms
The Old Faithful Snow Lodge, within walking distance of Old Faithful geyser, is an important addition to visitor housing at Yellowstone, the first national park. Half of the 100 rooms opened a year ago, and the other half this May, when the hotel was dedicated. Replacing a building originally intended as employee housing, it was built by Amfac, the concessionaire, and the Park Service, using recycled timbers and low-energy fixtures. The architecture is in the style used for the early lodges in the parks. Like Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel in Yellowstone, the Snow Lodge is also open for a midwinter season. Rooms range from $101 to $141 a night.
Dunraven Lodge, near the Yellowstone Grand Canyon, is even newer, having opened June 14. The 44 rooms, all with private bath, replace cabins built in the 1960's. Rates are $105 a night, double or single. A restaurant at the registration area serves the Dunraven and the Cascade Lodge and nearby cabins. Reservations at Yellowstone may be made at (307) 344-7311 or on the Web at www.travelyellowstone.com.
At Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada of California, the concessionaire, Delaware North Parks Services, has opened the new Wuksachi Lodge. This year-round hotel, with 102 rooms with private baths, opened on Memorial Day weekend. Some rooms have sitting-room areas with sliding doors and convertible sofas, attractive to families. The rates are $110 to $155 in the peak season. The Wuksachi has a restaurant on the premises that is available to day visitors as well as guests. Reservations: (888) 252-5757.
The Wuksachi and the smaller John Muir Lodge in adjoining Kings Canyon National Park provide lodging to replace 200 old cabins, lodges and shops that are being removed from the Giant Forest-Lodgepole area under a 1980 park development plan. The John Muir has 30 rooms, 6 of them suites, all with baths, with rates starting at $125 a night for the standard rooms. There is no restaurant in this small lodge; guests can take meals in the restaurant that serves all of the lodges in the Grant Grove area. Reservations: Kings Canyon Park Services, (559) 335-5500.
 
Grand Canyon Plans
Completion of a new transportation system for Grand Canyon National Park is still some time off, although ground was broken this spring for the new Canyon View information plaza. The goal, as with many other long-term national park plans, is to reduce the number of private cars by offering other alternatives that are less damaging to the environment and the air quality.
By 2002, according to Sandra Perl in the park office, a six-mile light-rail transit system will link a parking lot at Tusayan, outside the south park entrance, to the new information plaza near Mather Point. From there, visitors will be able to board shuttles running on an alternative fuel, ride a bicycle (they will be available for rent) or a wheelchair, push a stroller or walk to the Greenway along the north and south rims.
In May, Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the Grand Canyon park to inaugurate work on the Greenway, which covers 73 miles. The information plaza is scheduled to be finished in September 2000.
But when this is all done, park officials and Amfac point out, people with reservations in the lodges will still be able to take their cars into the park, either directly to lodges that are away from the rim, or to parking lots where shuttles will pick up guests for the lodges at the rim. At the moment, autombile access continues as before.
Grand Canyon lodge reservations are available at (303) 297-2757, or at www.amfac.com. Some specials for the Grand Canyon were posted on the site in mid-June.
 
Aftermath of Wildfires
Four wildfires at Joshua Tree, set by lightning, consumed 13,000 acres in 96 hours in late May, according to Ernest Quintana, the superintendent. "Parts of the park may look a bit scruffy for a while," he said.
Most of the areas closed while the fire was fought were reopened by Memorial Day.
Joe Zarki, the chief of interpretation, said that most visitors to Joshua Tree in late June were from overseas and that his staff was making every effort to explain about the fire and the Park Service's new policy on dealing with wildfires, which emphasizes techniques that are "light on the land."
 
In Eastern Parks
Things are moving along in East Coast parks, too.
North Carolina's Cape Hatteras Lighthouse began a 2,900-foot journey back from the ocean in mid-June. It will take at least six weeks to get the lighthouse, 4,800 tons of it, onto steel tracks and over to a safer spot, where it will be lowered onto a new foundation. The lighthouse will be closed to visitors, but the process will be visible through frequently replenished pictures at www.nsp.gov/ caha/lrp.htm. The Park Service hopes to have the lighthouse open again by next Memorial Day.
At Acadia National Park in Maine, a propane-powered bus system began its first summer of free runs two weeks ago, making circuits of the park with calls at the Bar Harbor airport, motels and ferry landings.
Those who have visited the main section of Acadia, on Mount Desert Island, know that automobile traffic is a bane. The procession through the park dissipates pleasure in the surroundings. If you can find a parking spot in Bar Harbor, the main town, it is difficult to avoid a parking ticket because the limit is two hours.
The bus system, called the Island Explorer, will operate eight vehicles on six routes every day until Sept. 6. Each bus can carry 28 passengers and 5 bicycles. Allowingbike riders to get into the park with their bikes means that they need not pedal the whole 20-mile loop at once, but pick the route they want. Hikers, too, can pick up another bus to leave the park. Campers using Blackwoods Campground will get from Bar Harbor Airport to the campground in an hour.
Sixteen agencies, including the state and Federal Departments of Transportation, and several towns in the area contributed to the Island Explorer project. The buses are operated by Downeast Transportation, a local nonprofit bus company.
A Free Acadia Shuttles flier will be available at hotels, shops, the airport, ferry terminals and elsewhere. Information: (207) 667-5796.

Where Riots Raged, a Neighborhood Emerges

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM; Todd S. Purdum is chief of the Los Angeles bureau of The New York Times.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
SEVEN years after the Los Angeles riots shook Southern California and the world, the words "South-Central" still evoke the open wounds of urban decay and social dislocation. But here on a wide swath of once-grand Vermont Avenue at 81st Street, seedlings of renewal are taking root this summer.
Against all odds, 36 mustard-colored, stucco town houses -- half of them built above storefronts facing the street and the rest around an interior court -- are filling up with first-time homeowners, most of them single mothers. In the process, Vermont Village Plaza is testing anew the possibilities of the New Urbanism of its award-winning architect, Daniel Solomon. 
 Mr. Solomon, a 30-year veteran of the architecture faculty at the University of California at Berkeley, has been a charter member of the New Urbanism, a school of architects, planners and theorists that has sought to rebuild, or replicate, the kind of pedestrian-oriented streetscapes and manageable-size neighborhoods that prevailed in American cities before World War II. The group has deplored the abandonment of traditional city cores and the rise of suburban sprawl, with its malls, office parks and isolated tract housing.
From his San Francisco-based firm, Solomon Inc., Mr. Solomon has designed projects ranging from re-interpreted San Francisco row houses to the Congregation Beth Israel Memorial Garden, a funerary chapel in Houston, and has done "a lot of urban infill in rough and dangerous places," as he put it in a recent inteview. The South-Central site posed special challenges, not nearly all of them architectural, but after more than five years, Mr. Solomon's vision of a low-rise 1930's-style stretch of shops and apartments has at last taken shape.
Where a weed-strewn, vacant lot once sat like a scar, a graceful three-story facade of pilasters and balconies now marches along the street front, broken by palm trees. Remote-controlled security gates protect interior courtyards and two-car garages. Each two- or three-bedroom unit has skylights and ample open space, creating a remarkably uncrowded feeling on the compact, 1.75-acre site. There is even an on-site automatic teller machine.
"We built it for $77 a square foot, and it doesn't look like that, I don't think," Mr. Solomon said of the project.
The two-tone facade in soft yellows is accented at periodic archways with inset black and white tile, with vertical red stripes painted in crevices. Windows stretch seamlessly up the second and third stories, and inside the units they run ceiling-high to capture as much daylight as possible. The effect is a sleeker, stripped down version of a mixed-use Art Deco apartment complex whose contours would have made Raymond Chandler feel at home 60 years ago.
"The idea was to create an environment that accommodates cars, private open space, light from two directions, making them have the amenity and security of private houses, but at considerably higher density," said Mr. Solomon. "The basic physical idea is that housing can sustain a little bit of scattered retail and services, when there is not that mass of parking that would support large retail outlets."
But even reaching consensus on that concept took time and hard work. The $8 million project is a direct outgrowth of the 1992 riots and of the decades of commercial abandonment of the Vermont corridor that preceded and helped prompt them. After the violence, local banks and financial institutions came under severe criticism for their reluctance to invest in the area and one of them, First Interstate Bank, sponsored a design contest for a residential-commercial development, with perhaps 130 low-income apartments.
"The riots were the immediate focus, and the media hook for this," Mr. Solomon said. "But the real underlying urban decay is not the riots. It's the abandonment of the commercial corridors of the city, which was the motivation for new mixed commercial space here."
The idea was to use the vacant Art Deco husk of the former Hattem's Store, a 1931 supermarket and shopping arcade that later became the administrative building of Pepperdine University, as an anchor to draw commercial storefronts and stable housing back to the area. Vermont Avenue is one of the city's longest streets, stretching from the port at San Pedro north to the Hollywood Hills. But beginning 40 years ago, as white residents fled to the suburbs and were replaced by working class blacks, retail businesses began abandoning the strip, leaving the neighborhood lacking services from dry cleaners to shoe repair. The situation was exacerbated by the burning and looting -- and eventually the permanent closing -- of scores of stores in the riots.
But First Interstate's proposed remedy immediately ran into intense opposition from black middle-class homeowners in Vermont Knolls, a stable neighborhood of tidy yards and well-tended single-family homes immediately to the west, who feared the project would draw undesirable tenants from the much poorer, largely Hispanic area that stretches in squalor from the east side of Vermont Avenue.
In 1994, Mr. Solomon's firm won the commission from a field of more than 60 contenders, in partnership with Caleb Development, a company owned by Rodney Shepard, an enterprising developer of single-family homes in nearby Watts whose first career, in the aerospace industry, was all but undone by cocaine addiction in the early 1980's. His life in tatters, Mr. Shepard, whose father was a carpenter and whose mother owned apartments in Watts, fell back on the business he knew: he began rehabilitating and, eventually, building single-family homes for sale there, in the process earning a "1-A" rating from Dun & Bradstreet and expanding his sights.
Mr. Solomon and Mr. Shepard sought to address neighborhood concerns by shrinking the project from 100 units to 60, to 40 and finally to 36 homes, with room for about a dozen retail outlets and more in the former Hattem's building.
"We all thought this was one time when not-in-my-backyard resistance to low-income housing was justified and agreed that it should be subsidized market-rate instead," Mr. Solomon said.
First Interstate, which was bought by Wells Fargo during the project, contributed $3 million of the initial construction cost and the City Council overrode Mayor Richard J. Riordan's veto to kick in the remaining $5 million. Units were priced from $89,000 to $118,000, and all but one have sold, half of them to members of the nearby Crenshaw Christian Center, a giant nondemoninational church complex on what had been the Pepperdine campus before the school moved to Malibu. But the project proved unable to draw enough market-rate buyers, and 21 of the purchasers received heavy subsidies in the form of second-mortgages backed by the city that allowed downpayments as low as 3 percent.
ONE of those who qualified was Sharon Johnson, a single mother of two and a customer relations manager for Viking Office Products who had lived in the south Los Angeles suburb of Gardena and drove past the project on her way to an event at the nearby Sports Arena. She now has a spanking new three-bedroom unit, and her 10-year old daughter even has her own bathroom.
"This is my dream home," she said recently as she stood surrounded by moving boxes and mattresses in a house whose nine-foot ceilings make it seem larger than the roughly 1,600 square feet it is.
Both Mr. Solomon and Mr. Shepard sigh at the long trail of complexities involved in getting the project built and laugh ruefully at the occasional cultural divide between the black inner-city developer and the white academic architect. When a visitor remarked on the flowering vines growing up galvanized chains in the inner courtyard, Mr. Shepard just shook his head.
"Don't even go there," Mr. Shepard said. "I said to Dan, 'Do you know what chains mean to a black man?' And he said, 'Look at it this way: you broke your chains and hung them on the wall.' "
At the moment, Mr. Shepard's biggest concern is leasing out the storefronts (tenants could range from a bakery to a private post office like Mail Boxes Etc.) and winning City Council approval for money to finance commercial-tenant improvements, plant trees on the median lining the street and rehabilitate the 26,000 square feet of commercial space in the former Hattem's Store. It now sits empty on the corner of the site, its distinctive faceted tower looming like those of the vintage movie palaces that still dot Los Angeles, its sea-foam paint peeling and at odds with the new project meant to echo it.
"It's a shame, because you've got these beautiful town houses and then you've got this big eyesore," Mr. Shepard said.
Indeed, the challenge is just beginning. Solomon Inc.'s official description of the project starts with these sobering words: "Isolated development initiatives and autonomous architectural works will not begin to redress the problems of South-Central Los Angeles. South-Central is confronted with the task of rebuilding whole streets and linking separated enclaves into a larger community."
But in the interview, Mr. Solomon said: "The lesson is that the housing demand is there in these neighborhoods, if the housing is priced right and designed properly for security and space, and quite high density housing can thrive on those corridors. It's easier to make the housing part of it work than the commercial part, but the commercial part is terribly important."

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

A Tenant's Storage Space
 
Q. As a rent-stabilized tenant in a New York City co-op for 21 years, I have used the tenants' luggage and trunk storage area in the basement. The co-op is now interviewing contractors to remodel this storage area into pay-for-use storage bins. I need this space but cannot afford to pay for it. Can the co-op take the space away from me and/or start charging me for it? . . . Yvonne Cunningham, Manhattan.
 
A. "The reduction of a tenant's storage space is usually a hotly contested issue," said Daphna Zekaria, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer. "And it's an issue that is usually resolved by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal upon a tenant's complaint of a decrease in services." 
 Ms. Zekaria said that the Rent Stabilization Code prohibits the reduction of services supplied by a landlord as part of a rent-stabilized tenancy. And generally, she said, the D.H.C.R. will order a rent reduction to compensate for the elimination of a service, provided that the service not considered "de minimis."
The determination of whether a reduction of storage space is de minimis, she said, would be made pursuant to a D.H.C.R. memorandum specifically addressing the issue. In short, Ms. Zekaria said, the memorandum states that unless the storage space is provided for in a separate rider to the tenant's lease (as opposed to a general clause in a standard residential lease), or unless the owner has provided tenants with individual storage boxes, bins or separated gated areas within three years of the filing of the tenant's complaint, a rent reduction will not be ordered.
If the tenant's lease rider contains a provision for storage space, Ms. Zekaria said, the tenant would also be able to file a civil action in State Supreme Court requesting the court to order the landlord to continue to provide the service. Since the letter-writer is a tenant in a co-op, Ms. Zekaria said, and since the co-op apparently intends to continue to make storage space available, albeit for a fee, the tenant's landlord could continue to provide the storage area simply by renting the space from the co-op and letting the tenant use it.
 
Co-op Sponsors' Renting Apartments
 
Q. It seems that some sponsors who converted their buildings to co-ops have now, in effect, reverted the buildings back into rental buildings by leasing and re-leasing apartments that were not sold at the time of the conversion. This impacts negatively on the value of units owned by shareholders who purchased their apartments because new purchasers have difficulty getting mortgages in buildings with high numbers of non-owner-occupied apartments. Are there any laws governing the amount of time a sponsor can rent an apartment? . . . Carol Miller, Manhattan.
 
A. James G. Samson, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that there is no law that specifically requires co-op sponsors to sell unsold units by any particular point in time.
However, Mr. Samson said, the courts have ruled that a co-op corporation can sue a sponsor for monetary damages for fraud or breach of contract if the sponsor fails to make a good-faith effort to sell unsold units.
He explained that since the offering plans for most conversions stated that the sponsor was offering all the units in the building for sale, buyers could reasonably be led to believe that all apartments in the building would ultimately be sold to individual residential owners.
Failure of the sponsor to make a good-faith effort to do so, he said, would constitute a breach of the offering plan. While it is typically quite expensive for a co-op to maintain such a lawsuit -- legal bills can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars, he said -- the battle usually ends up being even more expensive for the sponsor.
Mr. Samson explained that a sponsor who owns the shares of unsold apartments has an obligation -- like any other shareholder -- to pay his or her share of the expenses of the co-op, including the co-op's legal fees.
"That means that if a sponsor owns 50 percent of the units in a building, he ends up paying 50 percent of the co-op's legal expenses and 100 percent of his own," Mr. Samson said. "That's why many of these cases end up settling."

Office Space for Sublet Jumps as Companies Revamp

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
LIKE families trading their current home for a larger or smaller one as their space needs change, companies have been rearranging their corporate houses at an increased rate in the last six months due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidations, brokers say.
That has led to more than doubling the amount of sublet space filtering back onto the 11-county northern and central New Jersey office market, which now stands at 4.3 million square feet, according to Grubb & Ellis, a national commercial brokerage. Subleases represent 17.4 percent of the overall available office space in the state today, according to Cushman & Wakefield, another national brokerage. 
 A main contributor to the sublet space supply is AT&T. The company's work force of 25,000 employees, down from 31,000 since it splintered into three companies, is being consolidated into buildings it owns. "So a lot of the leased space we had is no longer needed," said Ritch Blasi, an AT&T spokesman.
He said his company had 715,000 square feet of such space on the market, including a 400,000-square-foot building off Interstate 78 in Berkeley Heights.
Among the other companies reconfiguring their space needs is the Hoechst Corporation, a pharmaceutical and chemical concern, which is subletting a 210,000-square-foot building in Warren Township. Alpharma, also a pharmaceutical company, is subletting 37,000 square feet in Fort Lee, while the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is subletting a 165,000-square-foot building on the Jersey City waterfront.
The bankruptcy earlier this year of Pinnacle Health Enterprises of Reston, Va., which managed the HIP Health Plan of New Jersey, and the H.M.O's liquidation last March has also put 207,000 square feet of medically oriented office space back onto the market. Much of the space has reverted to the original leaseholders, including Horizon Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Jersey, and is being marketed for sublease.
No one is sounding any alarms about the increase in sublet space, which is considered among the signs of a softening market. But brokers say they are watching it.
"Of the market indicators we track, it's the only one pointing in the wrong direction," Arthur Della Salla, regional research manager at Grubb & Ellis, said of sublet space. "All the other indicators are pointing in the right direction."
The state's economy is strong, businesses are growing and rents continue to rise, although not as rapidly as in the last two years. Average overall asking rents are $22.68 a square foot a year, up from $22.30, six months ago. The average rent for Class A space, newer space in prime locations, is
$25.73, according to Grubb & Ellis.
At the same time, new buildings, many built on speculation, are adding to the buildup of space.
"Up until nine months ago, New Jersey had an undersupply of space," said Robert J. Rudin, executive managing director at the Saddle Brook office of Insignia/ESG, a national commercial brokerage. "That led to new construction at the same time sublet space was coming on the market, creating a slight oversupply of space."
SOME 3.8 million square feet of space are now under way, with a million more feet completed in the last nine months, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Meanwhile, in the second quarter, 454,263 more square feet were put on the market than were absorbed.
Cushman & Wakefield also said that the vacancy rate for Class A space rose to 9.9 percent in the second quarter from 6.6 percent a year earlier.
The increase was most pronounced in the I-78 corridor in Somerset County, where a spate of new construction and sublet space has been put on the market, pushing the vacancy rate to 18.4 percent from 7.7 percent, data from Cushman & Wakefield show.
The question, many brokers said, is whether the buildup of space is a temporary blip or a long-term trend. The other unknowns that could affect the market are whether interest rates continue to rise and whether the state's tight employment grows even tighter, said Jonathan Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization, a commercial brokerage in Woodbridge.
But brokers, like developers, are betting the situation is short term.
"Leasing activity is not its highest level and absorption is not fabulous," said Donald P. Eisen, executive managing director of the New York region for Cushman & Wakefield. "But there is caution in the market, which is good because developers are not feeling they can do anything they want and the market will get them out of trouble."
Mr. Rudin of Insignia/ESG added that speculative construction might stop for a while, allowing space to be absorbed. "This is not an oversupply situation like the 1980's, when the market was depressed and vacancy rates hit 18 percent," he said. "So the window will quickly close."
Meanwhile, sublet space has become a factor in the market. One appeal of such space is that it is generally offered at discounted rents because companies want to fill it quickly to minimize their expenses, brokers said. The trade-off is that the new tenant usually has to accept the space as is, they said.
The impact of such space varies, depending on the amount of vacant or new space in a given submarket. In the I-78 corridor, for instance, where new buildings have sprouted or are under way, subleases are adding to the competition. They include AT&T's 400,000-square-foot building in Berkeley Heights and Hoechst's 210,000-square-foot building on Independence Blvd. in Warren.
A new building completed in December, the Connell Corporate Center III, with 245,000 square feet, is the third of three buildings -- the first is the one AT&T is subletting -- on the 170-acre business campus off I-78 being developed by the Connell Realty and Development Company of Westfield. It ultimately will contain 1.7 million square feet.
"No, we're not competing with ourselves," Lee S. Martino, a vice president at Connell said of the AT&T sublease. "But the additional inventory in the area has had an impact. It's about supply and demand, and now there is more of a supply."
Mr. Martino said the new building recently attracted tenants, including Microsoft and Schering-Plough, which together signed on for 129,000 square feet.
Not far away, the Wellsford Commercial Properties Trust, based in Chatham, last April completed the renovation and expansion of a two-story, 92,000-square-foot building into a four-story structure with 120,000 square feet. It is part of a two-building complex on Mountain Avenue in Berkeley Heights.
The second building, with 175,000 square foot, has been fully leased since Wellsford acquired the complex in 1996.
"Subleases create greater competition, so you have to fight harder for deals," said Leo Paytas, director of leasing at Wellsford. But the impact will be short-term, he said, noting that in the last one or two months "new space requirements have come onto the market."
He said part of his company's strategy was to offer the Mountain Avenue space at rents 10 percent below market.
Lower rent is also what will attract tenants to the Hoechst building, said Mr. Rudin of Insignia/ESG, which is marketing the space. He said the company would leave the two-year old building, where 13 years are still remaining on the lease, late this year to relocate to a building it owns on Route 24 in Summit.
In tight markets like the Jersey City waterfront, or those like Fort Lee where limited new construction is taking shape, subleases provide a "viable alternative," said Leonard T. Miller, a director at Cushman & Wakefield. He is making that pitch to tenants as he markets the 37,000 square feet of space Alpharma is subletting at the Fort Lee Executive Park on Route 4 because it needs to move to larger quarters to meet its expansion needs.
That is also the case for the medical-oriented space left behind from the HIP-Pinnacle bankruptcy, said Mr. Schultz, who is marketing four out of the nine spaces. They are in Brick, Clifton, Parsippany and Jersey City and together total 90,000 square feet.
"The space is a commodity," he said, "because it offers tenants an opportunity to enter a market at a less expensive cost."

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
That Family Figure Watching Over Us Is Not Big Brother

BYLINE: By SARAH BAYLISS; Sarah Bayliss is an associate editor of Artnews magazine.

 BODY:
CONTRARY to popular belief, Uncle Sam wasn't born on the Fourth of July but on Sept. 13, 1766, in Arlington, Mass. And he had many guises before James Montgomery Flagg painted a stern, white-haired man proclaiming, ungrammatically, "I want YOU for U.S. Army."
Uncle Sam's namesake was Samuel Wilson, a meat packer who settled in Troy, N.Y., and supplied food to American troops during the War of 1812. 
 According to legend -- and to an eyewitness report published in The New-York Gazette and General Advertiser in 1830 -- a workman joked that the letters "U.S." on Wilson's shipping crates stood for "Uncle Sam" Wilson. The anecdote spread and led to the patriotic symbol now reproduced in political cartoons, advertisements, posters and fine art. Images of Uncle Sam, including portrayals by Currier & Ives, Thomas Nast, Charles Dana Gibson and Andy Warhol, can be seen in "Uncle Sam: The Face of a Nation," at the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan through Aug. 21.
In truth, Samuel Wilson's life had little to do with Uncle Sam, except that he was a tall, enterprising Yankee. As he evolved into a star-spangled icon, Uncle Sam surpassed Lady Liberty, Columbia, Yankee Doodle and Brother Jonathan as the most popular personification of America. Since then, he has endorsed American products from Liberty Bonds to cleaning powder to Ex-Lax. Star-spangled hats can be found on old Grateful Dead albums, and Allen Ginsberg wore one in 1966 for a Central Park peace rally. Today, the red, white and blue top hat pops up as a screen icon for Turbotax, the popular software used to calculate income-tax returns.
In the 19th century, Uncle Sam represented rural, down-home America -- most of the country -- in contrast to Britain's portly mascot, John Bull. In some cartoons, Uncle Sam and his shabby alter-ego, Brother Jonathan, were interchangeable. More often, though, Uncle Sam represented the Federal Government and Brother Jonathan the common man. "Uncle Sam Sick with La Grippe," an 1836 cartoon by Edward Williams Clay, finds him wearing a flaglike robe, weakened by a financial crisis. A humble Brother Jonathan appears outside a window, greeting the doctor. Thomas Nast, the political cartoonist whose comic inventions included the Democratic donkey and the Republican elephant, is credited with popularizing Uncle Sam's goatee. In Nast's "Uncle Sam's Thanksgiving Dinner" (1869), the avuncular host presides over a banquet table of guests symbolizing different nations, including stereotypes of Chinese, Spanish and Irish families.
If some early portrayals of Uncle Sam now seem racially insensitive -- many show the lanky patriarch attended by crude caricatures of African- and Asian-Americans -- he carried great authority during times of national crisis. "Lady Liberty came to be associated with the single topic of immigration," says Grady Turner, co-curator of the New-York Historical Society show. "She doesn't rally you to patriotism going into war. Uncle Sam is a warrior figure." Perhaps that is why Mr. Flagg chose him for his now-famous World War I recruitment image, created for a 1916 cover of Leslie's Illustrated Weekly Newspaper and reprinted the next year on posters.
With some four million copies distributed during World War I and more than one million during World War II, it was the most famous, and most parodied, American poster of all time.
Today, Uncle Sam's severe patriotism is too old-fashioned for the Army's "Be all that you can be" campaign (though he does appear, saluting, on a new 33-cent stamp). "Uncle Sam is a historical keepsake," says Douglas Smith, a public affairs representative for Army recruitment. "We don't want to portray ourselves as a World War I or World War II recruiting agency. The modern concept of the Army is that you serve your country and your service comes with benefits back to you."
It's also likely that Uncle Sam's Yankee heritage doesn't hold sway with current American racial demographics. "A nation that sees itself as diverse can't rally behind an old white man from the Northeast," says Mr. Turner.
Maybe not, but it can parody and adapt him for a variety of purposes.
Since the 1960's, Uncle Sam has championed causes from the discriminatory to the ridiculous. "Uncle Sam has become the symbol of radicalism and counter-culture movements," says Elena Millie, the curator of the poster collection at the Library of Congress and of a 1994 Uncle Sam poster show.
"When people see him, they say: 'Oh. What's he doing for us now?' " In spoofs of Flagg's picture, Uncle Sam has endorsed the Ku Klux Klan, civil rights and the admission of homosexuals to the military. A 1968 poster supporting Pope Paul VI's ban on birth control among Roman Catholics featured Uncle Sam admonishing Americans against taking the Pill. Ben and Jerry's 1994 search for a chief executive officer for their ice cream company had him saying, "We want you to be our C.E.O."
Indeed, Uncle Sam's survival probably rests on the fact that any fringe group can claim him as a spokesman. "Uncle Sam can mean everything to everybody -- he can have great power," says Mike Darnall, the author, with the illustrator Alex Ross, of the graphic novel "Uncle Sam," published by DC Comics earlier this year. In the book, a tattered and confused Uncle Sam wanders through time in a dank American landscape, at one point getting into a fistfight with his own double. "I like to think that there was a certain civility in a country represented by gentle old Uncle Sam," says Mr. Darnall. "But we're living in a world where Senators call the President a scumbag. If Uncle Sam existed today, he would cover his ears in shock."
Mr. Turner notes that many children arrive at the New-York Historical Society show without knowing who Uncle Sam is. "He led to his own decline," Mr. Turner says, "by being a stereotype and consorting with other stereotypes."
Uncle Sam's future is still bright in some regions. Since 1961, Troy, N.Y., has been the official home of Uncle Sam, declared so by a 1961 bill pushed through Congress by Senators Jacob K. Javits and Kenneth Keating of New York, to the consternation of some modern-day Arlington residents who want to revive interest in Samuel Wilson's birthplace.
Sept. 13 is Uncle Sam Day in Troy, and Fred Polnisch, a local Uncle Sam impersonator, is busy keeping Samuel Wilson's story alive. Crowds love to hear about Uncle Sam Wilson, he says, almost as much as they like his star-spangled shoelaces. And if they don't know a lot about American history, they do have one strong association with Uncle Sam. "Some people ask me why I'm taking all their money for taxes," says Mr. Polnisch. "I tell them to write to their Congressmen."

HEADLINE: Summer Is Here, But Where Are The Lifeguards?;
To Fill the Chairs, State Learns to Be Inventive

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
WITH only about 100 people on the beach and the water temperature a frigid 58 degrees last month, Rob O'Brien, a lifeguard at East Beach at Cove Island Park in Stamford, did not have to worry about anyone venturing out too far.
Though he has been a lifeguard for five years and is also a qualified water safety instructor, Mr. O'Brien, who is a college student, makes less money as a lifeguard than he could as a clerk at Home Depot or a waiter at a restaurant. But his love of the beach, coupled with a sense of responsibility, brings him back to a lifeguard stand in Stamford every summer. 
 Given a strong economy and plenty of summer jobs, not all college students are as willing as Mr. O'Brien to forsake higher-paying jobs to work for an average of about $7.50 an hour as lifeguards. As a result, as the summer beach season gets into full swing, some beaches in the state, particularly at state parks, don't have enough lifeguards.
That's the case at Hammonassett State Park in Madison and Sherwood Island State Park in Westport. Norwich doesn't have enough guards for the pond in Mohegan Park and Fairfield could use a few more for the town's six beaches.
"At last count, we still needed about seven guards for jobs, which pay between $6.50 to $10 an hour," said Bill Mattioli, the water safety program coordinator for the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees state parks. "We've tried to recruit at high schools, Y.M.C.A.'s and other places in search of guards, but it's more difficult than ever. Not only to young people want jobs that pay more, but a lot of them also don't want to assume the responsibility you have as a lifeguard."
The problem, which began about five years ago, has gotten so bad that some communities have had to find new ways to recruit. Stamford paid the $125 fee for a life-saving course to people who agreed to become lifeguards. Norwalk went after members of the high school swim team and Darien advertised on the Internet. The state even lowered its age requirements by a year, now allowing 16-year-olds to become guards. What few communities are doing, however, is raising the pay to make the job more attractive.
"There's no question in my mind that compensation levels have to be addressed," said John Roman, the aquatics director for four beaches and two public outdoor pools in Stamford, noting that Stamford pays its lifeguards between $7.50 and $10.75 an hour. "There's a misconception that lifeguards sit in a chair all summer and work on their tans, when in truth the job is a profession that requires intensive training."
Most lifeguards know that they could make more money elsewhere.
"I like the fact that the job entails responsibility and the fact that you build friendships with the other guards and become part of a team," said Peter Smith, a 19-year-old college sophomore who is a third-year lifeguard at Calf Pasture Beach. "True, the money isn't much, but I supplement what I make here by giving swim lessons at the Y on one of my three days off."
Rob Smith, the manager of Hammonassett State Park, said getting lifeguards used to be easy.
"Eighteen years ago, we had 32 guards, which was enough to cover the whole beach, but now we have 18," Mr. Smith said. "That means we can cover only about a mile and a quarter of the beach, which is two miles long, and have to fly yellow flags over the uncovered areas," -- the yellow flags signify that lifeguard stations in those areas are not staffed and that people must swim at their own risk.
Because of the difficulty in obtaining guards, Mr. Smith said he has been forced to hire more young people. "The average age used to be around 23, but now it's about 20," he said. "And this year, for the first time, we lowered the minimum age to 16."
Glenn Dochtermann, the park supervisor at Sherwood Island, said that he has had to fly more yellow flags the last few years.
"We used to have as many as 18 lifeguards at Sherwood Island, but we're down to only six the last few years, and we get as many as 15,000 people on a Saturday or Sunday," Mr. Dochtermann said. "Because of the shortage of guards last year, in addition to flying the yellow flags, we also had guards patrolling the beach by jet skis just beyond the swimming area. And we've also had to use kayaks and pontoon boats, since we haven't had enough guards in the chairs.
"To try to get guards this year, we recruited in schools and also distributed flyers in supermarkets and other places," Mr. Dochtermann said. "So far, we've managed to get 14 guards, which at least is a lot more than we had last year. Then, too, the state is paying lifeguards the same money as when I came on in 1989" -- between $6.50 and $10 an hour."
Mr. Mattioli of the Department of Environmental Protection said safety has not been compromised at the state parks, which can draw 35,000 people on a weekend day. "There's plenty of room to swim in areas where the beach is guarded," he said. "And that's what most people do."
Some communities, such as Norwich, have raised salaries this year. "We raised our rates a dollar to between $9 and $11 an hour,"said Luis DePina, the director of the Norwich Recreation Department, whose lifeguards oversee the pond in Mohegan Park. "But we're still short a few guards."
Pam Raila, the acquatics supervisor at Calf Pasture Beach in Norwalk, has something of a recruiting edge. "I go after members of the swim teams at Norwalk High School," said Ms. Raila, who is coach of the girls' swim team at the school.
Ms. Raila's recruiting efforts are reflected in the makeup of her lifeguard staff. Of the 16 guards, all nine young women who work full-time are swimmers at the high school as is one of the seven young men. "And of our 16 guards, all but one are back from last year," she said.
Stamford, with 65 lifeguards, is at full complement, but the city had to scramble to get their guards.
"It required a lot of hard work," said Scott Beauregard, the city's Assistant Superintendent for Recreation.
"We knew we could be in trouble this year because of all of the jobs out there for college and high school kids. So we actively recruited by distributing flyers at the high schools in town and also contacting guards we had had last year. In addition, we ran three 40-hour lifeguard training sessions, which cost $125 for the 21 people who took the course, with the understanding that we would reimburse the cost to those who signed on as lifeguards and stayed with us through the summer. As it developed, 12 of those who took the course are now guards."
Apart from distributing flyers at Greenwich High School, Fred Walters, the acting superintendent for marinas and facilities in Greenwich, said he does not actively recruit lifeguards.
"We manage to get the 36 we need at our four beaches," he said, "but it's nothing like 20 years ago when you'd get 40 applications for 20 jobs. Also, we also have to compete with the private clubs, which like to hire kids from the high school swim teams to be lifeguards and also serve as coaches and swim teachers."
Other affluent towns like Darien and Westport also have managed to fill their allotment of lifeguards.
"We contact guards from the previous year and also advertise on the Internet, and we finally got all 17 spots filled," said Marikate Murren, the recreation official in charge of hiring lifeguards in Darien.
Stewart McCarthy, the director of the Parks and Recreation department in Westport, said he was amazed that his department was able to hire the 50 guards needed at Compo Beach and for the community pool at the Longshore golf, tennis and swimming complex owned by the town.
"We give these young people an incredible amount of responsibility, and they're also exposed to hepatitis and A.I.D.S.," he said, "and yet they do it for between $7.25 and $10 an hour. But they do have a good work environment and get a sense of accomplishment for what they do. And to most of them, that's important."

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY;
TellingThem What They'll Pay to Hear

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst is a novelist and financial journalist. His column tilting at conventional business wisdom appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I ONCE knew a woman who couldn't seem to get her career off the ground. Her personal finances were a shambles, and she had little experience in the world of business. Naturally, she became a management consultant.
It crossed my mind to short the stock of any companies she visited, but I was afraid I'd get in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 We live in paradoxical times. Executive compensation is spiraling out of control, yet the more companies pay their chief executives, the more help they seem to need with basic questions like "What business are we in?" and "Where do we go from here?" Companies appear to be equally at sea about how to organize themselves -- hardly surprising, given that so many of their workers seem to produce nothing tangible.
The upshot is an army of management consultants, ready to feed what The Wall Street Journal recently called "the business world's seemingly insatiable desire to engage in organizational self-analysis." Kennedy Information Research Group, which tracks management consulting, says the global market grew 22 percent last year, to $89 billion, three-fifths of it in the United States; in 1980, the figure was just $2 billion.
But the industry, if you'll pardon the expression, isn't sitting on its laurels. "Management consulting continues to hunt for the 'next big idea,' " says a report on Kennedy's Web site. "Re-engineering has faded, replaced by E.R.P. integration, Knowledge Management, E.V.A. and supply chain work." Don't ask -- by the time you figure out any of these fads, they'll be over.
I don't mean to be a spoilsport. Hiring a consultant makes sense for many specialized tasks, from writing an annual report to designing a parking lot. But why do so many companies need outsiders to tell them how to run their businesses? It's as if top management, which lives in the same therapy-crazed culture as the rest of us, has decided that it must pay someone in a nice suit to nod sagely and tell it what it already knows, because it has trouble hearing the same message from anyone else.
There are now 70,000 management consultants in the United States, and about 150,000 executives at sizable companies in the kinds of jobs that would bring them into contact with consultants. That comes to just over two consulters for each consultant.
Those figures come from a paper by Staffan Canback, himself a consultant, published last year in The Journal of Management Consulting. "The tremendous growth of the management consulting industry over the last 20 years cannot be easily explained," Mr. Canback wrote. But he has a theory: The complexity of business today leads to high "costs associated with organizing economic activity," as he puts it, accounting for as much as 45 percent of gross domestic product in developed societies, according to one estimate he cited. Controlling these costs devours management attention and generates demand for consultants.
But what good is done by paying millions to a chief executive who then turns for help to a bunch of wet-behind-the-ears M.B.A.'s?
 PERHAPS hardest to justify are the executive compensation consultants, some of whom are said to charge $750 an hour. Graef S. Crystal, a critic of excessive executive pay and a sometime consultant himself, thinks compensation consultants may be best of breed when it comes to getting paid for smoke and mirrors, since they invariably recommend raises for the executives whose compensation they are hired to assess.
By comparison, consultants who flog "organizational development" are a bargain, offering services that, if no more useful, at least cost less. The thirst for their services seems impossible to slake. Mr. Crystal cites a remark by Eugene Zuckert, a former Secretary of the Air Force: "The perfect organization is the one you don't now have."
In a few minutes' surfing of the Web, I found a consulting firm that says its strength is "analyzing and re-engineering the Emotional Economics of our clients' workplaces." Another "offers programs and services in organizational change and development, facilitation, strategic planning and leadership training." The sites don't say what these firms charge, but I can't imagine they're cheap at any price.
Then again, all societies pay dearly for their shamans. Why should the world of business be any different?

Tears and Cheers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Until reading Wendy Wasserstein's article about her project to introduce theatergoing to New York City students, I could have honestly said that the newspaper had never made me cry "A Place They'd Never Been: The Theater," June 20 . But the reactions and feelings expressed by the eight students she took under her wing had me in tears. 
 Exposing the young to the theater should become the pet project of every producer, director, playwright, choreographer, designer, actor, singer, dancer and theatrical union in New York today. What could be more rewarding?
A grassroots effort like this one, sponsored by the Theater Development Fund, is a thumbed nose to those who would kill funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. Members of Congress who would do so should be ashamed not to understand that participating in our cultural heritage is absolutely essential to enriching it.
Moreover, an organized move like T.D.F.'s could help bring the magnificent invalid back to robust health and at the same time do more toward eradicating economic barriers between New Yorkers than any talk about the importance of theater by old white people on the Tony Awards.
Actions speak louder than words, and if those at the top of the theater food chain really want to see things grow, a project like Ms. Wasserstein's is the most practical, rewarding and enjoyable way to work toward that worthy goal.
I wish there were some way that I, as an individual, could volunteer to sponsor students through some organization like T.D.F. I would gladly pay for the tickets myself just to be able to share the wealth, so to speak. Sign me up, Wendy, and if it's deductible on my taxes, sign me up twice.

To the Editor:
 Ms. Wasserstein's effort to bring high school students to the theater is commendable but hardly gets to the root of the problem. Theater tickets are indeed expensive, but T.D.F. and its TKTS booths in Duffy Square and at the World Trade Center make it economically accommodating for folks determined to get to a play.
Until the city, state and Federal governments provide dollars to get the arts back into the school curriculum, the theater will be perceived as something beyond most students' reach. Involve a youngster in a school orchestra, an art class or a drama club, and they will be hungry to see how the professionals do it. 
 The theater could use its celebrity to pressure elected officials. Taking kids to a play should be a pleasurable supplement: the priority should be to effect institutional change.
When you consider the money we spend to incarcerate youngsters, we should match it dollar for dollar to educate our youth at all levels. For too many New York City public school students, doing time on Rikers Island is a greater probability than their attending a Broadway play.

HEADLINE: At a Wedding, It's Still Not In to Be Out

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS 

 BODY:
SO it's 1999 and you're gay. So what? Your boss is gay. Ellen's gay. Will of "Will and Grace" is gay. Rupert Everett, who is gay and played a gay man in "My Best Friend's Wedding," is now playing Mr. Right in "An Ideal Husband." The media understand you. Your neighbors do, too. So do your parents. You're well integrated and well connected. In fact, without being boring, you're as self-actualized as any post-modern urban gay person can be.
Then one day -- poof! -- you're reduced to a quivering mass of neuroses. You've been invited to a wedding. Not a commitment ceremony for same-sex couples. But a straight wedding, where you're seated with some pleasant, provincial people who want to know which side -- bride or bridegroom? -- you're on, and then start asking your partner question after question about what he's doing there until they force him to declare, for all to hear, that he's not your business partner. 
 "For gay people, weddings are always a reminder of being outsiders," said Charles Silverstein, an Upper West Side psychologist and the author of several books about homosexuality. "Even when people are welcoming, as they usually are these days, weddings can be extremely alienating experiences. They raise all sorts of ambivalence and take on a meaning far greater than any party ever should."
It seems more ironic than romantic that June, the month for weddings, is also the month for gay pride. Nothing tests gay pride more than straight weddings, many gay men and women say. For those who live in any of the nation's ever-so-inclusive gay-friendly cities, weddings provide that increasingly rare opportunity to feel ashamed, or at least self-conscious.
Marriage, of course -- from Romeo and Juliet, Henry VIII and the Duke of Windsor to Dennis Rodman and Adam Sandler in "The Wedding Singer" -- is a frequent source of trauma, and wedding anxiety is a nondiscriminatory phenomenon that crosses religious and sexual lines. But for gay men and women, the quintessential rite of heterosexual life presents a unique set of anxieties.
Kamal Ayyildiz, a Manhattan writer, was invited to be a member of a wedding party by a bride he had known since the fifth grade, but the bridegroom's parents were not happy when they learned he was bringing his companion. At the rehearsal dinner at a country club in Roanoke, Va., Mr. Ayyildiz said, he and his boyfriend were the only two of the 40 guests not assigned seats. They ended up circling around and around the room, to their mounting embarrassment.
"It turned out that the groom's mother had panicked at the idea of a gay couple and didn't have places for us," Mr. Ayyildiz said. Eventually, the bride's parents offered seats at their table.
Mr. Ayyildiz's experience was an exaggerated example of what most gay people report at weddings, where brushes with overt homophobia are rare; much more common are subtle, often unintended -- and sometimes self-inflicted -- causes for uneasiness.
"When you're around people who aren't around gay people that often," said Steven Druckman, a freelance writer, "you start watching everything you're doing, even how you lean back in your chair and put your arm around your boyfriend's shoulder." Mr. Druckman and his partner are recuperating this weekend after an entire month of weddings, where, he said, he endured more than a few withering looks.
"Often one of the families doesn't want you there, so you end up feeling like pariahs," he said. "I wanted to dance with my boyfriend, but he said he didn't think it was right. You can't just assert yourself at such a large social gathering."
Even Ronald Hellman, an openly gay Manhattan psychiatrist, who was united in a big family-oriented commitment ceremony last month with his male lover, a Reform rabbi, could not quite work up the nerve to dance at a straight wedding held the week before his.
"We're about as out as we can be, but we couldn't dance," Dr. Hellman said. "Dancing is very ritualistic, and it's very heavy. You need to know you're in a safe gay space before you do it."
Brad Bessey thought he was safe when he was invited to walk a bride down the aisle at a recent wedding. Then the bridegroom's family objected because he was gay. So the bride decided to defuse their anxiety by seating Mr. Bessey, a producer for "Entertainment Tonight," with her fiance's family at the rehearsal dinner. He didn't flinch. Rather, he turned up the charm.
"When I'm at a wedding," he said, "I will do everything in my power to make sure that people feel good about each other."
In modern society, in fact, from Oscar Wilde to Isaac Mizrahi, gay people have often developed senses of humor as defense mechanisms, making them particularly entertaining as hosts and guests. They are often called upon at weddings to serve as toastmasters, or to offer last-minute style tips about the bride's bouquet or the bridegroom's mother's shade of lipstick.
"It always seems to be our job to loosen things up and provide a spark," said Ted Kruckel, a press agent, who also believes that gay men buy the best presents. "Weddings are by their nature staid. Gay people bring a sense of levity to the event because it's so irrelevant to our lives.
"And of course, we're needed. I often find myself being asked to make a toast that will be a nice tonic to the tedium of the proceedings."
Wayne Nathan recalled working with the florist Robert Isabell on the splashiest New York wedding of the late 1980's, that of Laura Steinberg and Jonathan Tisch, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Gayfryd Steinberg called a week before her stepdaughter's wedding to say it was "too formal and stuffy," Mr. Nathan said. To counteract the pomposity, he hired a Brazilian band on stilts and booked a snow machine to blow white feathers around. "That was my great contribution as a gay man to New York culture," he said.
Mr. Nathan's sardonic tone is echoed by other gay men and women, who say they are subtly irked by what they perceive as a double standard: called upon to enliven the weddings of others, they are legally forbidden, of course, from having weddings of their own. Mr. Druckman, who is getting back in the saddle for another wedding next weekend, said that as much as he hates the affairs, he wouldn't mind having one of his own if they become legal. "That way, I can get my own blender," he said.
When her brother announced that he was getting married, Ann Northrup felt a little resentful as well. "There I was in a relationship for 15 years, and my brother was telling me that there are so many economic advantages to marriage that it seemed like the smartest thing to do," said Ms. Northrup, an Act Up member and a host of a cable show called "Gay U.S.A." "I cursed him out, and he ended up apologizing for the next 20 minutes." At his wedding reception, she made a toast that got her a laugh. "I announced that my brother and I shared the same taste in women," she said.
The playwright Jon Robin Baitz, meanwhile, recalls being in the middle of a toast at his brother's wedding, when he noticed that he was speaking to a sea of frozen faces.
"I was joking about maturity and commitment," said Mr. Baitz, who has been in a gay relationship for many years. "I thought I was just being honest. But I guess I didn't realize that I was talking about love in a cynical way that was very gay and inappropriate. I often end up feeling like I've stubbed my toe at weddings."
Many gay people feel uneasy when they are not invited to take a companion to weddings. One New Yorker has been invited to a wedding this month by a woman he has known for years. But the bridegroom's family is pressuring the bride to discourage him from bringing anyone with him.
"I completely want to participate in her wedding," he said. "But all my other friends have been invited to bring a guest. You don't want to make a fuss when people are already stressed out to the extreme with family politics at a wedding. But I really don't want to go alone. I guess the book of etiquette hasn't been written for people like us."
Ann Landers may not be able to give gay marriage her full support ("It flies in the face of cultural and traditional family life as we have known it for centuries," she has written). But salespeople at Tiffany's, Macy's and Barneys are doing everything they can short of breaking into song to make gay people feel good about registering for commitment ceremonies. Barneys even has a form to fill out that doesn't use the words bride and bridegroom, but rather partner and partner. There's a new book called "The Essential Guide to Lesbian and Gay Weddings." There are clergy members who will officiate (although not necessarily in an official capacity) and a vast segment of society that is looking for ways to open up to same-sex couples and wish them well. Still, many gay people aren't interested in aping the ceremony and social institution of marriage until it becomes legally binding.
Ultimately, for all their resentment and paranoia (not always justified), many gay people know that weddings are a trial that everyone must bear, gay and straight. Dan Savage, who writes a syndicated advice column, "Savage Love," gets lots of letters about weddings. "They've become so institutionalized that they're hollow and empty and depressing for everyone," he said, "and not just for the gay people who feel slighted because they can't have their own legal wedding that's hollow and empty and depressing, too."
Two years ago, Mr. Savage went to the wedding of his boyfriend's fundamentalist Christian brother in Spokane, Wash. He arrived ready to explode at the slightest offense, and ended up feeling, in addition to bored, welcome and at ease.
"These days, tolerance is the norm," said Mr. Savage, who chronicled his experience for Out magazine. "So spending all your time at a wedding trying to figure out who really likes you and who doesn't is exhausting and paranoid. I think that in the absence of the real tolerance we hope to find, the appearance of tolerance can be just as good."
Marcy Blum, a well-known wedding planner, agrees. "If gay people are acting paranoid or unhappy at weddings," said Ms. Blum, who often finds them acting otherwise, "it doesn't help an already tense situation." While she says she has never seen any homophobia at the weddings she has planned, Ms. Blum has seen lots of bridesmaids who looked as if they were ready to kill or die, often both.
"Hey, it's not easy being a gay person in a straight world," said Ms. Blum, who is 45 and divorced. "But it's not easy being a single woman, either."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
The Smokestacks Are Back

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
AN OIL driller, a maker of industrial cutting tools, an acquisitive steel producer and a paper company. Those were the kinds of blue-collar stocks that fueled returns of the top-performing mutual funds in the second quarter.
Such value stocks, as well as small-capitalization issues, came roaring back during the spring, shoving aside the large-company growth stocks that had dominated the market for so long. 
 The managers of three of the top-performing funds talked about the quarter just ended and looked ahead to the rest of the year.
 
Think Like an Industrialist
"After a year of emphasis on growth and large-cap companies, when investors were not at all interested in value or small-cap companies, valuations simply reached the extremes," said Dennis Delafield, 63, co-manager of the $102.1 million Delafield fund with Vincent Sellecchia, 47. Delafield, which owns small- to mid-cap value stocks, was the No. 15 performing United States diversified stock fund for the quarter, up 28 percent.
"Investors might not care about the companies we own, but industrialists do," he said. "They look at companies with free cash flow and modest valuations, and they acquire or invest in those companies. And that's what happened."
Mr. Delafield made money when Getronics, a Dutch company, acquired Wang Laboratories, in which he owned shares. The company, based in Billerica, Mass., was known for word-processing systems but now services desktop computer systems and networks. Getronics bought 91 percent of the company in mid-June for $29.25 a share, a 50 percent premium to its price at the start of the quarter.
Another winner was Kennametal, a Latrobe, Pa., maker of industrial cutting tools. Its earnings for the fiscal year ended in June 1998 were depressed because of a troublesome acquisition and the market's general disregard for such stocks last year, he said. The stock has rebounded 76 percent since March as a cost-cutting program began to bear fruit and the company named a new chief executive.
Mr. Delafield is now looking for clues to the direction of the world economy. "What happens the rest of the year depends on what happens in Europe and to interest rates," he said.
 
The Bargain Hunter
"The market is going through a rotational correction," said Jim Crabbe, 54, co-manager of the $98.7 million Liberty-Crabbe Huson Special fund with John Johnson, 62. The fund, a small-cap blend fund, returned 29.6 percent in the quarter, for ninth place among domestic diversified equity funds. "Some parts of the market are still very overpriced, but there are some tremendously good bargains, particularly among smaller companies," he said.
The fund's performance surge stands in stark contrast to its five-year return through June 30 -- negative 1.08 percent, annualized. The fund had been hurt severely because it shorted big stocks; it stopped doing so about a year ago, but that didn't solve the fund's problems. Last year, he said, "we owned a lot of economically sensitive stocks, and we got our clocks cleaned."
Among Mr. Crabbe's biggest recent winners was Marine Drilling, a Houston company that performs offshore drilling for the oil and gas industry. The company's share price plummeted when oil stocks were pounded at the end of last year. But that changed this spring. "There was a cutback in drilling for quite some time," he said, "but as people saw the price of gas increasing, they anticipated the company would start drilling again." The stock gained 24 percent in the quarter.
Another success for the fund was Ispat International, a Dutch steel producer, up 56 percent. Ispat bought Inland Steel, the American steel company, in the spring of 1998.
Mr. Crabbe expects the stock market's gains to continue broadening, reaching more small stocks. And the economy, he said, should keep growing. "There doesn't seem much danger that it won't continue plugging along at a pretty good rate," he said.
 
Ready for the Bounce
Investor optimism about the world economy was a big factor in fund performance for the quarter.
"Investors started becoming more aware that the U.S. economy was very strong and that world economies, especially Asia, were flat to getting better," said Robert J. Martorelli, who runs the $547.2 million Merrill Lynch Phoenix fund, a mid-cap blend fund that took the No. 12 place among domestic diversified equity funds, returning 29.1 percent. "In that kind of environment, cyclical companies tend to perform well."
Mr. Martorelli, 42, said he was buying oil and gas and other cyclical stocks at the end of 1998 and early 1999 "because that's where the value was."
Among his biggest winners was the LTX Corporation of Westwood, Mass., a maker of equipment for the semiconductor industry. LTX experienced slackening demand during the economic debacle in Asia last fall, but its stock rebounded as Asian economies stabilized, Mr. Martorelli said. He added that he liked LTX because demand for its new type of chip-testing device was growing rapidly along with the market for multifunctional chips used in increasing numbers of products. The stock rose 177 percent in the quarter.
Another success was Champion International, the paper company based in Stamford, Conn. Mr. Martorelli said he bought the stock in March because it was selling for the biggest discount to asset value among companies in its industry. Nothing happened in company operations to cause the subsequent rise in the stock price, he said, but investors thought paper prices had bottomed.
"Champion has a lot of earnings leverage, so a relatively small gain in paper prices produces incrementally larger gains in earnings," he said. Champion shares rose 17 percent in the quarter.
Mr. Martorelli expects value stocks to continue climbing as the economy keeps growing. "Strong economic expansion takes the cyclical risk out of our stocks, so investors can look at paper, chemical and steel companies and know that the demand for the products will be there," he said. "Besides, relative to the growth stocks that we had to watch grow endlessly over the last three to four years, these stocks are just cheap."

Which Waythe Fed? Sorting Out the Signals on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE inflation debate has been whittled down to a single issue.
No longer does anyone fret much about shortages in the great array of goods and services that Americans consume. Sure, there can be temporary scarcities and bottlenecks, and short-lived price spikes. But in the eyes of the Federal Reserve, only one kind of shortage has the potential to be inflationary in the late 1990's: a labor shortage. And that, too, may be losing its teeth. 
 There is indeed a labor shortage. The statistics are clear, the main one being the unemployment rate, which came in Friday at 4.3 percent for June. People are getting jobs everywhere, even in the inner cities where entrenched joblessness is finally giving ground. In Boston, for example, inner-city people ride streetcars to the last stop, then take taxis the final few miles to jobs at suburban companies. To get the workers, the employers pay the taxi fares.
Such tactics, which allow companies to tap the nation's remaining pools of idle workers, help postpone the day when corporate America might really have to bid up wages.
"Things are definitely better in the inner city," said Katherine S. Newman, an anthropologist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who works in such neighborhoods. "But you would have to see the lines of the unemployed shrink by a lot more than they have before you would see major increases in wages."
By past standards, after 24 months with the unemployment rate under 5 percent, those major increases ought to have appeared already, if not in the inner cities then elsewhere in the country. Pay is rising, of course, but not yet by enough to force companies to try to raise prices. Until that happens, the Federal Reserve cannot justify pushing up interest rates sufficiently to slow the hiring by slowing the economy.
There are those who argue that a significant acceleration in wages is just around the corner. But strangely, even though the unemployment rate has fallen below 4.5 percent since last November, wages and salaries have risen more slowly in recent months. There is deceleration, not acceleration. The same deceleration also applies to the corporate cost of health insurance and other benefits. And economists are scrambling to explain the anomaly.
"There is no smoking gun," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
For starters, everyone agrees that companies have become a lot more agile at fending off wage increases, while labor's bargaining power has declined along with union representation. As one substitute for raises, companies offer stock options, which do not show up in the Labor Department's employment cost data. And one-time signing bonuses lure workers without obliging an employer to raise the pay of comparable workers already on the payroll.
Labor productivity is clearly part of the explanation. It has risen smartly in the last two or three years, which means that workers are producing more for the same hourly pay, at least for the time being.
At a grittier level, service companies, particularly telephone call centers, distribution centers and clerical operations, have become more mobile. For example, dozens have relocated to northern Kentucky, where unemployment was relatively high, and to towns in Maine where shuttered shoe factories and paper mills left pools of not-very-expensive workers. Government subsidies also encourage companies to move.
IN a new study, two labor economists, Alan B. Krueger of Princeton and Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard, find that the unemployment rate may be kept artificially low by the very sharp rise in the male prison population. Prisoners are not counted as either employed or unemployed; if they were on the street, many would show as unemployed.
Then there is the aging of the work force; older workers are less likely to be unemployed. And don't forget the growing temporary-help industry, which keeps people off unemployment rolls between permanent jobs.
Adjust today's unemployment rate for these three factors, and it would be around 5 percent, the study finds.
On a different plane, some experts explain the deceleration in wage growth by arguing that workers have become used to a low inflation rate and therefore settle for smaller raises, which seems strange when people are so much in demand.
Or perhaps job insecurity inhibits them. The National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago asks people how likely they think they are to lose their jobs. "The percentage of those who answer 'very likely' has not fallen all that much since the last recession," said Thomas Smith, director of the center's General Social Survey.
The list of explanations will certainly grow if the nation's tight labor market keeps failing to push up wages significantly. No one will collect these explanations with greater interest than the Federal Reserve's policy makers. They cannot push up interest rates much beyond last week's quarter-point rise without a significant rise in labor costs as justification.

Serving Up Hearty Meals of Information on Wheels

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
Charlene A. Patterson, 19, can rattle off a list of attractions in upper Manhattan the way other college students might list their favorite ballplayers: the Yeshiva Museum, the African-American Wax Museum, the Morris-Jumel Mansion, the Studio Museum. But even though she grew up in Harlem, Ms. Patterson had not heard of most of these places until a few weeks ago. "To tell the truth, I've lived here all my life and really didn't know there were this many things in the community," she said.
But anyone stopping by her visitors' cart at Broadway and 165th Street, near the Audubon cultural center, might find her wealth of information staggering. 
 "You'd be surprised how many people don't know what's in their own community," she said. "We try to tell them there's a museum right here 10 blocks away from you, and you don't need to go all the way downtown to experience the arts."
The information cart she tends is one of four that were placed in strategic locations in upper Manhattan last week as part of a new effort to promote tourism and economic development. Sponsored by the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the Union Settlement Association and the Manhattan Borough President's office, the program, called Uptown Ambassadors, involved training and paying 10 college students from Harlem, East Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood to help tourists and residents navigate their neighborhoods.
"Tourism has the potential to have a significant economic impact on upper Manhattan's communities," said Rodney E. Lopez, director of communications for the empowerment zone. "So this initiative is designed to make sure that this important information about the area's historic sites and attractions is available to whomever wants it."
At each of the four carts -- at Audubon, Fifth Avenue and 103d Street, Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and 125th Street, and Dyckman and 200th Streets -- one English- and one Spanish-speaking student at any time provide brochures from cultural institutions, menus for local restaurants, notices about events at bars and clubs and information about historic sites. The students are paid $8 an hour.
Uptown Ambassadors is the start of a larger effortplanned for this fall by the empowerment zone called the Upper Manhattan Visitor Network. The carts, which cost about $16,000 each, were bought by the Manhattan Borough President's office. The entire Uptown Ambassador project cost slightly more than $100,000.
Mirianna Pisano, Union Settlement's program director for Uptown Ambassadors, said about 150 people visited the carts each day since the program began on Tuesday. "People came despite the rain," she said.

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.;
Which Way the Fed? Sorting Out the Signals on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve is not in the business of trying to confuse investors. With testimony, speeches and comments from its chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other Fed officials, the central bank's leadership has done its best to telegraph all its moves in recent years. That is why there was no surprise when the Fed announced on Wednesday that its short-term interest rate target was rising a quarter of a percentage point, to 5 percent.
But the other half of the announcement was a surprise, and it left many investors scratching their heads -- which ought to add to market volatility on the road to the Fed's next policy meeting in August. 
 Along with the rate increase, the Fed said it had changed its outlook on interest rates from a bias toward higher rates -- a stance adopted at the May policy meeting -- to neutral.
For investors, the first question is what the switch means. The second is what the Fed was thinking. Surely, the policy-making Open Market Committee knew that the change would be interpreted positively by investors and give the stock market a boost, making a gentle slowing-down of the economy -- the ostensible purpose of raising rates -- that much harder to achieve. Sure enough, all three major market indexes hit new highs by week's end.
Many investors saw the switch to neutral as a signal that one rate increase would be enough to brake economic growth and curb inflation. But that is hard to believe, given recent economic and price data.
Some 268,000 nonfarm jobs were created in June, the Labor Department reported on Friday, while hourly earnings rose 3.7 percent over the last 12 months.
The manufacturing sector -- whose earlier slump had helped restrain wage pressures -- is rebounding and gaining momentum. With the stock market now recovered from its spring selloff and consumer confidence at a 30-year high, it is difficult to conclude that consumers, the backbone of this expansion, are about to rein in spending.
The new surge in oil prices, which last week jumped above $19.50 a barrel, should raise inflation concerns. With that jump, and a rebound in industrial commodity prices, we could be in for another shocking leap in the Consumer Price Index. The 0.7 percent surge in April helped prompt the Fed's bias toward higher interest rates in May and the actual increase that followed.
A look at the Fed's recent history shows that a move to neutral does not rule out another rate increase, or even indicate that inflation outlook is improving.
For example, the Fed went to neutral after each formal meeting when rates were raised in the 1994-95 run-up, a period when the Federal funds rate, the overnight interest rate on loans between banks, jumped from 3 percent to 6 percent in seven separate moves.
MOREOVER, the language used to explain the shift to neutral after the Fed's previous quarter-point rate increase, in March 1997, made clear that the neutral bias referred only to the next few weeks, until the committee was scheduled to meet again. "While additional policy tightening might be needed at some point, it did not appear very likely that developments during the inter-meeting period would require a further policy move," the minutes of the committee meeting said. According to the minutes, members who argued for a bias toward higher rates said they could accept the neutral stance as long as there was "careful monitoring of new developments for any signs of the need for prompt action." In other words, nothing was ruled out.
An echo of that emphasis on vigilance appeared in last week's announcement, in which policy makers said they must "be especially alert."
Which leaves the question of why the Fed spoke up about its shift to neutral, knowing that investors would put the most positive spin possible on the news.
One explanation is that the Fed was locked in by its new disclosure policy. In the past, such a change in stance was not divulged until after the subsequent policy-making meeting, about six weeks later. But beginning this year, the Fed has announced changes in its leanings on interest rates immediately when the moves were considered significant.
Or the Fed may be trying to slow the economy with as little disruption as possible. Mr. Greenspan said last month that he was not aiming to prick any stock market bubble. He also said it is not the Fed's practice to plan a series of interest-rate increases in advance. Both goals were advanced by the return to a neutral stance on the rate outlook.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD;
On Japanese TV, the A B C's of Money

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THE world of high finance could hardly believe the news on the front page of The Financial Times last month. Goldman, Sachs & Company, as snooty as Wall Street's notoriously snooty white-shoe firms get, was sponsoring a TV program for Japanese homemakers? Surely someone had confused the firm with Procter & Gamble.
Yet on the last Saturday afternoon in June, there it was. TV Tokyo broadcast a one-hour special to introduce "Money Angels," a weekly half-hour drama that unlocks the mysteries of financial planning for Mrs. Watanabe and her neighbors. And every so often, up popped an ad for Goldman's mutual funds. At least for a half-hour on Saturday afternoons in Tokyo, the firm is trading its white shoes for house slippers. 
 Despite a title that evokes Farah Fawcett, the program is a serious attempt to explain the basics of household financial planning in a country where many consumers are baffled by compound interest, never mind dividends or debentures. In American eyes, sponsorship of such a program might seem silly and out of character for a firm like Goldman, but in the context of Japan, it is an ambitious example of a company paying more than lip service to the widely touted mantra, "Think globally, act locally."
"In this market, we think this is going to be an interesting and potentially very successful way of reaching the consumer," said Mark Schwartz, who was recently promoted to head Goldman's business in Asia. "We would never do something like this in the U.S. because it's not appropriate there, but here it makes a lot of sense."
Why? For one thing, Japanese homemakers have a tight grip on the country's $11.1 trillion in household assets. They determine how their household budget is allocated, where savings are deposited and what, if any, investments are made.
For another, Japanese consumers are hungry for basic information. "There is a very high level of interest here, not specifically in investing but in what this world of investing and financial planning is all about, and especially how it works," said Yasuyo Yamazaki, Goldman's ebullient head of asset management in Japan. Some 90,000 people attended the 600 investment seminars Goldman held in Japan last year.
People here are acutely aware that as they are living longer, the population is aging, and both public and private pension systems are grossly underfunded. Less understood, and harder to explain in a country where prices are falling, not rising, is the notion that piling up cash in a savings account that earns less than 1 percent interest -- the going rate here -- will not likely assure a comfortable retirement.
Mention concepts like risk and reward, portfolio diversification and asset allocation to a typical Japanese homemaker, and be prepared for a bewildered stare tinged with ever-so-slight disapproval: In Japan, risk is a four-letter word.
The program revolves around three women, Hinako, Yuko and Kuroda-san, the "money angels," who are meant to function as consumer advocates. A well-known actress, Fukumi Kuroda, plays Kuroda-san, the head of a consulting firm whom clients often ask about financial matters.
In the first episode, a mother and father tell their stunned children that they should not expect any inheritance, since the parents will not be able to finance their own retirements. The children appeal to the money angels for help, and so begins a series of visits to real-life financial consultants and others who demystify market principles by explaining ways to pump up savings.
"The topics are deliberately broad," Mr. Yamazaki said. "The most important thing is for this show to educate the viewers, because the more intelligent they are, the better it will be for us."
ALTHOUGH Goldman has no retail brokerage outlets of its own, and must rely on Japanese brokerage firms and banks to sell its funds, Mr. Yamazaki's operation is the sixth-largest mutual fund company in Japan, and 5 of the country's 10 most popular funds are Goldman's, according to one survey.
Mr. Yamazaki, a born showman, has achieved that by using unorthodox marketing methods -- unorthodox at least for Goldman. He and his sales force spend a lot of time roaming the banks and brokerage firms that sell Goldman's funds. He writes a column, "Asset Management with Zack Yamazaki," for a weekly newspaper read by more than six million people, and receives about 500 letters a month from readers.
Goldman was receptive when TV Tokyo, the station loosely affiliated with Japan's leading financial daily, Nikkei Shimbun, approached it with the idea for "Money Angels" last year, because Goldman had already sponsored a program on a satellite channel and was pleased with the response.
"It's not as if we didn't approach Japanese firms at all," said Masato Ikeuchi, executive vice president of Television Tokyo Channel 12 Ltd. "But their reaction was, well, dull. They understand where the industry is heading, but they've not yet reached the point where they want to spend money on advertising and marketing." In any case, in their present state few Japanese financial institutions could afford it.
One viewer's reaction illustrates what "Money Angels" is up against. Tazuko Makio, 72, who lives with her retired husband, said the program was clear and informative, if a bit stiff, and illustrated issues from the consumer's side better than news programs did. But Mrs. Makio won't be buying any mutual fund shares. "Those things are for people with a lot of money," she said; her nest egg will stay in accessible, riskless savings accounts.
"Money Angels" represents more than just an innovative approach to an idiosyncratic market. It is also one more sign of Goldman's adaptation to the rigors of being a public company. In order to smooth out its earnings stream, Goldman is trying to build up its asset management business, which lags far behind those of its rivals, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. But the effort is likely to scuff its white-shoe image a bit.
Mr. Schwartz denies that backing "Money Angels" raised any eyebrows at the firm. But others say Goldman's executive committee is sensitive about how its support for the program will be interpreted.
Analysts say stepping out in new directions will be good for Goldman, whatever the impact on its traditional image. A more homespun demeanor may help the firm cultivate a whole new crop of clients to add to its roster of blue-chip corporations.
Goldman may even be taking a lesson from the very companies that have long sought its advice. "Look, the mutual fund business is very different from the other businesses of Goldman, Sachs," Mr. Yamazaki said. "It's a consumer business, and we're learning from Sony, Tiffany, even McDonald's."

Filling a Skill Shortage, Close to Home

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
WHEN Dan Lopez was a freshman at Oak Grove High School in San Jose, Calif., a teacher asked his class if anyone was interested in being the first to try a new program that would prepare students for careers in the travel and tourism industry.
It sounded like a lot of work. There would be extra classes and internships in the field over the summers. But the internships were paid, and Mr. Lopez, whose parents had not attended college, hoped participating would improve his chances. 
 "I thought it would open up another avenue that would be possible not just in the here and now but in the future," said Mr. Lopez, who followed through and joined the program, sponsored by the National Academy Foundation. Now 23, he is working this summer as a manager at a Homewood Suites hotel and will be a senior at San Jose State University in California in September.
Mr. Lopez is also looking forward to meeting President Clinton this week, as the foundation gets a high-profile endorsement for its pioneering work linking high schools and corporations to prepare students for jobs in growth industries.
The President is scheduled to announce plans on Thursday for an Academy of Information Technology, to be financed in part by Lucent Technologies and based on the model established by the foundation, a nonprofit organization founded and championed by Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup.
Since the establishment of a financial services academy in 1982 at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, nearly 20,000 teen-agers, most of them from minority groups, have graduated from academy programs, which now involve about 300 schools across the country. About 90 percent of the graduates go on to college.
"I'm a great believer that this country has been an incredible place for creative people and entrepreneurs, and I think it's very important that people who have that kind of opportunity give back to our society and make it a better place," Mr. Weill said by telephone. "The things that work best are when you get the private and public sector working together in concert."
It is a theme that resonates with the President's agenda this week. Mr. Clinton is planning to visit several of the nation's most economically distressed regions with industry executives who are already investing in them in some way -- and who will exhort others to do the same.
Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said the goal is to prompt corporations to see underdeveloped communities as new markets, rather than targets of charity. "The focus of this trip is untapped potential," he said. "We are exhorting corporations to understand that these are mutually beneficial programs. Giving disadvantaged youth the opportunity to learn job skills is as critical for future economic growth as it is for social fairness."
The President is scheduled to start the visits tomorrow in Appalachia. Then, in East St. Louis, Ill., he will meet with Hugh McColl, the chairman of Bank of America. Later, Mr. Clinton will go to Pine Ridge, S.D., and Phoenix. The last leg of the trip will take him to Watts in Los Angeles and to Anaheim, Calif., where the National Academy Foundation will hold its annual teacher training session and awards ceremony.
THE plan for the technology academy comes on the heels of a Commerce Department report affirming the frequent complaints of information technology executives that there are not enough qualified workers to meet the demand. The industry has also come under criticism recently from Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois, and others for not employing more blacks and Hispanics.
"Information technology is a complicated area of curriculum that most schools are not focusing on," said David Ford, president of the Lucent Technologies Foundation. "We believe this will help address the industry's need."
Lucent has agreed to donate over $1 million, or one-quarter of what it will cost the National Academy Foundation to develop the program. The plan calls for 10 schools to start the pilot program in September 2000. But the foundation will first have to solicit the remainder of the funds from other information technology companies, in an industry whose newest companies are not exactly known for philanthropy. Mr. Weill and Lucent's chairman, Richard McGinn, who are close friends, plan a meeting to encourage other donors to step forward.
The technology academy would be the third theme curriculum for the foundation. The first, which trains students for jobs in the financial services industry, was created by Mr. Weill in 1981, when he was chairman of Shearson Loeb Rhoades. The Academy of Finance opened in 1982 and expanded in 1986 to include an Academy for Travel and Tourism. Citigroup contributes about $2 million annually to the foundation's programs. Other underwriters include American Express, the Merrill Lynch & Company Foundation, Bloomberg L.P., Sallie Mae, the McGraw-Hill Companies and Marriott International.
The formula, which also requires active participation by local business executives, appears to have worked.
"Before I was in the academy, I thought business was only one thing, like being in an office all day with a bunch of numbers," said Eloisa Chavez, 18, a graduate of the Academy of Finance and Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan. Ms. Chavez, of the Bronx, who now attends Williams College, said an internship at Standard & Poor's taught her that business is as much about people as it is about math.
The academy provided other kinds of training, too. "Every Wednesday, our Academy of Finance coordinator would tell us to dress up as though you were going to a business job," she said, "and if you didn't dress up, he would get on your case."

HEADLINE: The Harbor Crunch;
Barges. Tugs. Cabin Cruisers. Tour Boats. Can the Coast Guard Keep Up With All the Hubbub in New York's Waters?

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
THE Fourth of July weekend is always hectic in New York Harbor and elsewhere along the city's 578 miles of shoreline. But these days, any warm weekend will bring small navies of pleasure craft onto the busy waterways, where they compete for space with everything from colossal container ships to sightseeing boats to people parasailing around the Statue of Liberty.
With an economy that seems to be shipshape and cleaner waters lapping at their shores, New Yorkers are returning to the city's rivers, canals, kills and coves in swelling numbers. Fast ferries crisscross the water like furious insects, while cabin cruisers dodge kayakers and swerve around sailboats. Meanwhile, tug and barge traffic is booming. 
 So who's keeping the peace out there? Much of the burden falls on the United States Coast Guard, which in New York is stationed at Fort Wadsworth, a former Navy base at the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on Staten Island. But many commercial and recreational boaters say the Coast Guard, which has experienced major budget cutbacks in New York in the last four years, including a reduction in staffto 520 from 2,300, is barely able to keep up with the burst of maritime activity, especially during the summer. And they wonder whether the Coast Guard will be able to handle expected growth in commercial and recreational traffic in the coming years.
Some of the burden of managing the busy waterways falls on the New York Police Department Harbor Unit. "We work very closely in conjunction with the Coast Guard to keep the peace," said the unit's commander, Capt. John Cassidy. With 150 officers and 16 boats year round and an extra 25 or 30 officers and 10 boats during the summer, the police concentrate mainly on recreational boaters and enforcing state laws, Captain Cassidy said, while the Coast Guard tends to focus more on commercial vessels and compliance with Federal laws. "But that's not to say we don't overlap," he said.
"Fortunately, I haven't suffered the staff and budget cuts that hit the Coast Guard," Captain Cassidy said. "I know the Coast Guard feels their resources are stretched to the limit, and I for one would like to see more of them out there."
Many harbor users agree. Linda O'Leary, vice president of American Waterway Operators, a national association of tug, tow and barge companies that represents 300 barges and 150 tugboats in the New York-New Jersey area, which are responsible for 75 percent of all vessel trips in and around the harbor, said: "It's messy out there. The Coast Guard is getting smaller, and the harbor is getting busier. We haven't reached the point of complete collapse, not yet. But we'll be there very shortly."
Officials of the Coast Guard and other government agencies, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, say that neither the quality nor level of services provided has been hurt. But there is concern about the future.
"This isn't the same port it was five years ago, and it absolutely is not the same port it will be five years from now," said Richard E. Bennis, the captain of the Port of New York and New Jersey and the highest ranking officer of the consolidated area command, called Activities New York. He said the Coast Guard continued to "carry on with all of our commitments and missions." But, he added, "We don't have enough people and we don't have enough assets to do every job. So we look at where the greatest risks and greatest threats are, and concentrate on those things."
Though it is a branch of the armed forces, the Coast Guard is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation. In 1995, the Clinton Administration announced a four-year plan to reduce Coast Guard expenses nationwide by $400 million and to cut its work force of 39,200 by 4,000.
In New York, the Coast Guard's budget has been cut by more than half, to $20 million, mainly because two of the service's commands were moved to ports in Virginia. In October, three of the service's seven cutters -- 65-foot tug boats used for patrols, inspections and law enforcement -- are scheduled to be decommissioned; two high-endurance cutters have already been sent to other ports.
One big target of the cuts was the Coast Guard base at Governors Island, which was closed in 1997, though most of the vessels and personnel stationed there were used throughout the East Coast. The Coast Guard has since moved its remaining operations, the Activities New York command, to Fort Wadsworth.
This command stretches from Sandy Hook in New Jersey, across Lower New York Bay and Jamaica Bay to the Nassau County line in Long Island, north through the Port of New York and New Jersey and then all the way up the Hudson River to Lake Champlain on the Canadian border.
In addition to managing vessel traffic, the Coast Guard conducts search-and-rescue missions and marine environmental protection operations. It also licenses merchant marines and private ferries and performs boat inspections.
That's not all. The Coast Guard is also responsible for port security and maritime law enforcement, including drug interdiction (with a canine corps trained to fly in harnesses from helicopters). And it participates in counterterrorism activities with other agencies. Then there are the safety programs for commercial, passenger and recreational boat operators, maintenance of aids to navigation like buoys and range lights, and ice-breaking.
Every year, on average, the Coast Guard in New York monitors some 250,000 vessel movements from a high-tech command center at Fort Wadsworth that includes 17 remote video cameras stationed around the area. The Coast Guard is also responsible for insuring the safe passage of more than 40 million commuter ferry passengers a year.
And it creates security zones and blocks vessel movements during New York events like Presidential visits, the opening of the United Nations General Assembly and the Fourth of July fireworks. Planning is already under way for Op Sail 2000 a year from now, which will include a 60-nation flotilla and a huge fireworks display that is expected to draw some 40,000 boats to the harbor.
The Coast Guard's Activities New York command serves an area populated by 17.6 million people. As Captain Bennis likes to point out, that amounts to just $1.13 per person under the current budget. "Of all the military services, you get the most bang for the tax buck by far from us," he said. "We do everything we can do, even if it takes 60, 80 or 100 hours a week to deliver the goods. But we are stretched to the limit. We can't afford to lose one more dollar or one more billet."
The director of port commerce at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Lillian C. Borone, said that although Coast Guard services "have been cut severely," she was "pretty comfortable right now that it can continue to carry out its mission."
But, Ms. Borone added, "Of course we'd like to see more enhancement of services." And, she said, "we are very concerned that we can continue to assure harbor users that there will be tug availability, that ice-breaking still gets done, that buoy and navigation support continues and that rescue services remain at the current level of capacity."
Ms. O'Leary of American Waterway Operators said that while the Coast Guard was doing the best it could with the resources it had, it was "difficult and painful to see something as vital as Coast Guard services not being allocated the needed funds."
"They are trying to be meaner and leaner and do more with less," she said, "but it's very frustrating when you're trying to protect lives, property and environmental resources in what is undoubtedly the busiest and most significant port on the Eastern Seaboard and your responsibilities are enormous and your resources are a pittance. I'm sure they find it as frustrating as I do."
Ms. O'Leary, who is also vice chairwoman of the Harbor Safety, Navigation and Operations Committee of the Port of New York and New Jersey, said shipping companies and harbor pilots had begun complaining that the Coast Guard was stretched thin.
"With each season, the recreational traffic grows exponentially," she said. "Every new millionaire on Wall Street feels compelled to run out and buy a boat. And that adds to the already interesting mix of kayakers, jet skis and dinner cruises. And now we have seaplanes taking off."
"With all that traffic," Ms. O'Leary said, "it sometimes gets so scary people grab their heart and beg for oxygen."
Harbor pilots, who guide arriving tankers and container ships to port, say near-collisions are not uncommon. The pilots, who guide the big boats past Sandy Hook, N.J., across Ambrose Channel in Lower New York Bay, through the tricky Verrazano Narrows or the polluted and shallow Arthur Kill and into the shifting tides of the Upper Bay or to docking sites in New Jersey or Brooklyn, say recreational traffic often blocks the way.
"The Ambrose Channel seems to have the best fishing around," said the president of the Sandy Hook Pilots Association, Andrew McGovern, who is also chairman of the harbor operations committee. "And you can't see until you're about four miles from a congested area. You can slow down, but you can't stop because you'll lose control of the vessel. Generally, the boats get out of the way. But some figure they can get out of way at the last minute, and their engines won't start."
"We see them all the time," he continued. "Pleasure boats just parked right in the middle of some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. They park out there on warm afternoons and go fishing and drinking, and they aren't paying attention."
Apparently not everyone is fishing. "That salt air is definitely an aphrodisiac," Mr. McGovern said. "People get out in the middle of the water and figure nobody can see them. But I'm up 100 feet on the bridge and I can see things they don't think I can see. It happens all the time. All the pilots have seen it. And it's a real hazard because those people are definitely not paying attention."
Another hazard is personal watercraft, like jet skis. "The hot sport right now is going up to a moving ship and putting your hand right on it," Mr. McGovern said. "It's absolutely unbelievable." (The Police Department harbor unit recently added a jet ski task force consisting of two sergeants and 14 officers, Captain Cassidy, its commander, said.)
Lately, Mr. McGovern said, there has been "much grumbling" about the Coast Guard from harbor pilots. "They can only stretch themselves so thin," he said of the New York command. "They try hard, but they just don't have the manpower or resources, especially on warm days. You can call up and ask for a patrol boat to clear the channel. But either they are out doing search and rescue work or, if one's available, it's going to be a while before they get to you. And generally it's too late by then. So you just keep going. You blow your horn and pray everyone gets out of the way."
Recreational boaters have their own concerns about New York's crowded waters and the Coast Guard's ability to handle the traffic. Adam Brown, president of the Working Waterfront Association, a coalition of recreational boaters, marina operators and even swimmers, said Coast Guard budget cuts had rendered the service "unable to handle issues of safety given the increased number of operators in the harbor." There were 26,807 motorboats registered in New York City in 1997, the latest year for which figures are available, compared with 22,789 in 1990.
"Nobody anticipated the boom, and it's creating a lot of problems," said Mr. Brown, the founder of a recreational boating safety group called the Harbor Safety Committee. "Some of those cuts were made without really appreciating how quickly the water revitalization efforts would happen. And so many activities that are happening are very local, and that information doesn't filter up to the levels of government where the big funding decisions are made."
For years, boaters around the harbor have complained that high-speed commuter ferries churn up large wakes that crash against boats and docks and damage piers and bulkheads. "The Coast Guard gave us complaint forms, and we filled out 200 of them, but they never do anything," said Jim Gallagher, who owns an old ferryboat, the Yankee, at Pier 26 on the Hudson River near North Moore Street. "Nobody feels like it's their jurisdiction. The Coast Guard won't respond unless a life is at stake."
Lieutenant Chip Lopez said that the service could enforce only Federal laws, which do not cover vessel speed or distance from shore. "They literally flood us with complaints and, unfortunately, we're not equipped to handle it," he said.
If current trends in commercial, passenger and recreational boating continue, the problems will only get worse, many harbor users say.
Currently there are at least 46 marinas, with slips and moorings for some 6,570 boats, according to the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Plans for Hudson River Park, which is being built along Manhattan's West Side below 59th Street, call for new spaces for 218 motorboats and 1,590 nonmotorized boats. The park is also expected to draw many day boaters, especially during warm weekends.
Meanwhile, summertime ridership on water taxis and private ferry services (not counting the Staten Island ferry) has grown to more than 30,000 passengers a day from about 4,000 in 1988, said Alan Olmsted, director of the City Department of Transportation's office of private ferry operations.
As for commercial traffic, that, too, may be on the rise. New York Harbor is the No. 1 site in the United States for the movement of petroleum products, and its port is the third largest in the country for containerized cargo shipments. Though ship arrivals fluctuated at around 4,500 a year in the mid-90's, there were 4,943 last year, according to the Port Authority, which estimates that the volume of freighters traveling through the harbor could more than triple in the next 20 years.
And the port has big ambitions. The world shipping industry is planning to adopt the hub-and-spoke system similar to that developed by airlines, people in the industry say. The New York-New Jersey port system is competing with Norfolk, Va., and Halifax, Nova Scotia, to become the hub port on the east coast of North America.
But for New York Harbor to be competitive, it must be able to handle the new generation of supertankers, which require a depth of at least 45 feet. The Kill van Kull and Newark Bay channels, crucial waterways for the harbor shipping industry, are no more than 40 feet deep now. Yet work is already beginning to deepen those waterways. In March, the Army Corps of Engineers awarded a $23.6 million contract to dredge a 1.5-mile section of the Kill van Kull, the first phase of a five-year, $773 million project to make New York Harbor accessible to the big new container ships. The Federal Government is to pay 75 percent of the cost of the project.
In May, New York Harbor received another lift when two big shipping lines, Sea-Land Services and Maersk Inc., announced that they would stay in New York Harbor and expand operations instead of moving to Baltimore.
Later that month, work began in the Kill van Kull, which required the buoys there to be moved. But the sole buoy tender belonging to the Coast Guard's New York command was unavailable because it was being serviced, said Commander Mark Bobal, its public affairs officer, who also serves as chief of its inspections branch. Fortunately, he said, it was Fleet Week and Coast Guard vessels from other ports were visiting. A cutter from the Coast Guard base at Newport, R.I., took time off from ceremonial duties to do the job.
Despite the anticipated growth in harbor traffic, future financing levels for the Coast Guard in New York remain uncertain. During the height of the war in Kosovo, in May, Congress passed a multibillion-dollar emergency military appropriations bill that included an extra $200 million for the Coast Guard. But it is not clear whether any of that money will make its way to New York.
In mid-June the House of Representatives passed a transportation bill that would provide the Coast Guard with about $4 billion in fiscal 2000, an increase of some $153 million over current financing: the first big nonemergency increase in years. The Senate has yet to approve its transportation spending bill.
But even if the Coast Guard gets that additional $153 million, there's no way of telling how the money will be distributed. The process is complicated, based on the needs of the service's various districts. (New York is in District 1, whose headquarters are in Boston). And there is plenty of competition. In its 1998 annual report, the Coast Guard listed improved fishing patrols in the Bering Sea and antidrug and illegal- immigrant operations in the Caribbean and Pacific among its top priorities.
That doesn't mean safety will take a back seat, said a spokesman for Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, Jack O'Dell. "We will insure that New York Harbor receives extra money that will guarantee the port will be maintained and make sure that commerce can move safely," he said. He said he could not discuss details until the money was allocated.
"It's tough," said Representative Vito Fossella, a Staten Island Republican. "Do you put more money to stop cocaine in the Caribbean or to protect kayakers in New York Harbor?" he said. "I think they both have to be priorities. But how will we pay for it all?"
 
Helping the Coast Guard Do Its Job
With hundreds of miles of waterways under its command, there's no way the Coast Guard can be in all places at all times. But local, state and Federal authorities are also out there keeping watch, as are civilian volunteers. And maritime industry officials and recreational boaters are involved in efforts to insure harbor safety.
Law enforcement In recent years, various law-enforcement officials have been working together more closely and coordinating their activities with those of the Coast Guard. Among other things, these authorities police the area for people fishing illegally, dumping waste or operating boats unsafely. They also take part in search-and-rescue operations and staff boating-while-intoxicated checkpoints.
The New York Police Department Harbor Unit, with a fleet that expands in the summer to 26 boats and 175 officers, is the biggest. But there are also patrol boats belonging to municipalities along the Hudson River in New York and New Jersey, state agencies like the New York State Environmental Conservation Police and the New Jersey State Police.
Other agencies also maintain a presence on the water, including the Port Authority Police, the National Parks Service and United States Customs.
The Coast Guard Auxiliary Some 3,470 civilians in and around New York volunteer their time, and more than 300 private boats and 16 aircraft, to help the Coast Guard carry out a number of non-law-enforcement duties.
Auxiliary members receive special training and certification, and their vessels are required to meet certain requirements, including having tow rigs, two-way radios, fire extinguishers, first aid kits and extra blankets, lines, anchors and life jackets. They do not carry weapons.
Auxiliary boats are given special decals and flags to fly while on duty. Auxiliary members perform courtesy marine exams, check on buoys and other aids to navigation and help maintain security zones during special events. They also look out for spills and ice floes and conduct boating safety and education programs. Through these activities, they help free up Coast Guard personnel for other duties.
Maritime Industries About 25 years ago, commercial interests, the New York Maritime Association and government agencies around the port joined forces with the Coast Guard to create the Harbor Safety, Navigation and Operations Committee of the Port of New York and New Jersey to coordinate activities and address issues ranging from port safety and security to navigational aids.
One current project is a plan to create an informational network to pool navigational readings, like vessel tracking, global positioning and weather reports, and make them available in real time to mariners, port officials and the Coast Guard.
Recreational Boaters The Harbor Safety Committee, open to anyone who uses the waterways, was recently formed by Adam Brown, president of the Working Waterfront Association. (The group also belongs to the Port Authority's Harbor Safety, Navigation and Operations Committee.)
One issue on which it has worked with the Coast Guard recently is ferry wakes. Members also try to promote boating safety and help with advance planning for special events.

A Lawyer Opponents Can Like

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
MAYBE Lewis Carroll's Red Queen was right: Sometimes it really does take all the running you can do to keep in the same place.
Maura J. Abeln, general counsel for Owens Corning -- the front-and-center defendant in asbestos litigation -- is finding that out the hard way. For more than a year, she has fought off every potentially lethal attack on the settlement process she worked out so painstakingly with some 80 plaintiff's law firms ready to litigate more than 200,000 asbestos claims. 
 She waited, breath held, until the Supreme Court overturned a class-action settlement with Owens Corning's Fiberboard subsidiary two weeks ago, enabling Owens Corning to add Fiberboard's cases to its own settlement plan.
Now, it's back into the breach again. Ms. Abeln spent much of Thursday testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, which is considering legislation that could steer plaintiffs back into the courts. She melded compassion with practicality, in hopes that her settlements will be grandfathered out of any law.
"All we want is to stay out of the fray and continue with our own program," Ms. Abeln said. "I've got to protect it."
She is protecting the Owens Corning National Settlement Program, a plan for settling asbestos claims on the basis of how long claimants were exposed to an Owens Corning product and how severe their disease has become. She has traveled the country, meeting with plaintiff's lawyers and hammering away at their distrust.
She used humor -- lawyers found stuffed pink panthers, Owens Corning's consumer logo, in their mailboxes, and one received a gift-wrapped peace pipe. She used facts -- she showed them Owens Corning's books, trotted out its executives to answer questions and laid out what the company could pay and how quickly it could pay it.
And, against all odds, she won the enemy over. "I've had as many feuds with industry lawyers as anybody, and Maura is remarkable," said Fred M. Baron, of Baron & Budd in Dallas. "She's like a rodeo cowboy, she gets on that horse and stays with it, no matter how much it bucks."
Actually, the cowboy is not the first metaphor brought to mind by Ms. Abeln. A 43-year-old with a ready smile, she has a way of making anyone believe she is listening, absorbing and processing their every word. "I'm a big fan of Maura's, and it's hard for a plaintiff's attorney to say that about a corporate attorney," said John D. Cooney, of Cooney & Conway in Chicago. "She is blunt, straightforward and invites you to believe her."
Actually, when Ms. Abeln claims to understand the plaintiff's point of view, she means it. Her father, a foreman in a copper tubing plant in Reading, Pa., died of emphysema in 1986. "He'd come home with copper dust on his shoes, and that might have been the cause," Ms. Abeln said. "I see things from the plaintiff's perspective."
Ms. Abeln recalls her childhood as short on cash for luxuries -- she sold shoes and doughnuts in high school to help raise money for college expenses -- but long on the belief in self-betterment. Her mother did not go to college until she was 47, then worked in various social work jobs until she died at 72.
"She was quite the feminist, giving me copies of Ms. magazine when I was just 15," Ms. Abeln said. She said her mother also encouraged her to go to Vassar, "because she wanted me in an environment that showed what women could do."
Ms. Abeln caught on quickly. She had honor-society grades and was involved in the college newspaper and in sports like field hockey and softball. She won a Rhodes scholarship in 1976, the first year that women were accepted. She studied economics at Oxford, married and divorced, then accepted a full scholarship to study law at the University of Miami.
For a while, Miami seemed a permanent home. She married one of her law professors, had two children, and later built a thriving banking law practice as a partner at Baker & McKenzie.
By 1990, though, woes in the banking market left her practice in turmoil. Her mother died of breast cancer and her marriage disintegrated, leaving her to raise her small children alone.
When the General Electric Company's plastics division in Pittsfield, Mass., invited her to be its general counsel, she jumped. "I needed to do something different, and Pittsfield seemed a nice town that was closer to my brother in Allentown, Pa.," she recalled. Moreover, she was getting married again, to someone willing to stay home with her children, and she would be the youngest general counsel of any G.E. division. She was sold.
She got her first taste of personal injury claims when she handled G.E.'s silicone breast implant litigation. But Benjamin W. Heineman Jr., G.E.'s general counsel, remembers her more for her ability to work with people. "She built one of our finest global legal staffs," he recalled. "She knows how to inspire loyalty."
She also knows how to impress the brass. Glen H. Hiner was running G.E. Plastics when Ms. Abeln joined. He left six months later to become Owens Corning's chief executive, but Ms. Abeln had already made a lasting impression. When he realized that Owens Corning's asbestos situation had gotten out of hand, he came calling.
"We'd polarized the plaintiffs bar into a solid position against us," he recalled. "I knew Maura was smart and had a good business sense. But I also knew she could rally people to her side."
When Ms. Abeln came on board in February 1998, jury verdicts were turning against the company, just as its insurance money for asbestos claims was running out. "I have the most important job in this company after Glen's," she said. "If we kept trying to delay cases and deferring payments, we could not survive."
Her future? Although divorced again, she has not soured on marriage -- "I have a real need for emotional security," she said -- and is remarrying next June, to Steven Smith, a software consultant. And she remains as ambitious as ever."I certainly want to be a C.E.O. some day," she said. Mr. Hiner's take on that? "I wouldn't discount the possibility."

Redefining Bush-League Fund-Raising

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVEN though he has done it faster than anyone else, Gov. George W. Bush is not the first Texan to raise several gazillion dollars to run for President. He is the sixth or seventh, depending on whether you count Lloyd Bentsen.
Put aside Ross Perot, as Mr. Bush's father would have liked to do in 1992, because the cranky billionaire's chief fund-raising device was his personal checkbook. After that, Governor Bush's broad-brimmed $36.3 million, even adjusted for inflation, puts most other Texans in the shade, though not Lyndon B. Johnson and George H. W. Bush. 
 Mr. Johnson spent $10.5 million in 1964, according to Herbert E. Alexander, professor emeritus at the University of Southern California and founder of the Citizens Research Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies campaign finance. In 1999 dollars that is about $56 million. But almost all of it went for the general election, after Mr. Johnson had run surrogates against George C. Wallace in three primaries.
By any measure, Governor Bush has probably raised more money at this point in the fund-raising cycle than any previous candidate for President. Even if Mr. Bush's pace slackens a bit, he should pass Mr. Johnson's total by Christmas.
Nor is Mr. Perot's 1992 total of $67 million, mostly for general election costs, out of Mr. Bush's reach -- not even when adjusted to $79 million in current dollars.
But the most telling comparisons are not with either of those Texans.
After all, Mr. Perot spent his own money and Mr. Johnson ran before there were any real limits on campaign financing, especially the $1,000 cap on individual contributions to candidates -- a limit Mr. Bush said last week he wanted raised to some unspecified higher level.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen ran for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and spent about $2.25 million ($6.5 million in 1999 dollars) before giving up as the caucuses and primaries were beginning.
The most famous case of a Texan being the political equivalent of all hat and no cattle is John B. Connally. He had never been elected to anything as a Republican, but raised $13.7 million to run in the Republican primaries in 1980. That's $38 million in today's dollars, a figure Bush will pass sometime this month, if he has not already done so this morning.
But Mr. Connally's blustery campaign never caught on, and he won only a single delegate, Ada Mills, for many years the treasurer of the Arkansas Republican Party. Mrs. Mills became known as the "$10 million delegate" (a nice round number), and is living in Clarksville, Ark., no longer active in politics.
FINALLY there was Senator Phil Gramm in 1996. He raised $13 million by May 1995 and was eagerly advertising his money-raising skills. They didn't do him much good, partly because he was spending money almost as fast as it came in, partly because his message of Republican populism conflicted with his opulent fund-raising and partly because Pat Buchanan had a better pitchfork. Mr. Gramm ultimately spent $25 million and won 10 delegates, proving minimally more effective than Mr. Connally.
It will not be hard for Mr. Bush to get delegates more cheaply than Mr. Gramm, who paid $2.5 million apiece. Dozens of Republican officials who are sure to be delegates are already pledged to him.
The money he has raised so far is not more than anyone has ever spent to win a nomination. Bill Clinton reported spending $36.4 million in 1996 while Bob Dole spent $37.4 million (each amount supplemented by national committee spending).
Adjusted for inflation, Mr. Dole's spending equals $39.6 million today, and the Clinton total $38.3 million. Those figures include Federal matching money, which does not become available until the election year itself.
There is no reason to think Mr. Bush will stop raising money, and he has more than a year to do so before the national convention. Even if he did stop, enough money would probably trickle in to allow him to exceed his father's standards. Bush pere spent $19 million in 1980 and lost the nomination, $27.6 million in 1988 and won it, and $32.7 million in 1992 and won it.
Adjusted for inflation those sums equal $38.1 million, $38.5 million and $38.5 million in 1999 dollars. They are similar because the elder Mr. Bush accepted Federal matching funds, and that obliged him to abide by Federal spending limits.
Bush the younger will almost certainly not take the Federal money and will spend as much as he can.

HEADLINE: Fund Expenses: They're GoingDown, Down, Down;
Conventional Wisdom Is Belied By the Numbers

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
ASSETS were not the only things increasing at Fidelity Contrafund through the early 1990's. While the fund grew sixfold, its expense ratio also climbed.
But after peaking at 1.06 percent in 1993, the ratio began to fall. Now, Contrafund charges investors 0.61 percent every year to manage their money, the lowest amount in more than a decade. 
 Contrafund investors are not alone. The fees that the average mutual fund investor pays are going down.
The trend flies in the face of conventional wisdom, which holds that expenses have been flat, or even rising. Indeed, the industry has come under heavy public criticism for its high fees, which long allowed fund companies' stocks to outpace their funds' returns.
But the decline in fees is real. Kanon Bloch Carre, a mutual fund consulting firm in Boston, calculates that the average expense ratio paid by investors is down 16 percent over the last six years.
There are several explanations: Many investors have shifted assets to low-cost funds -- a byproduct, to a large degree, of their embrace of index funds. Corporate executives who negotiate terms for their companies' 401(k) plans have increasingly favored funds with lower fees. And new, low-cost competitors have joined the market.
Some industry analysts say fund companies will keep facing pressure to lower fees. After all, price competition is typical in maturing industries, as the battle for market share increases and growth slows.
But don't pity the fund companies. They
haven't lost their license to print money, with many fund companies seeing annual returns on equity that still top 25 percent.
You may have heard that fees are on the rise. For example, Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, has reported that expenses on the average United States diversified stock fund rose last year to $1.44 for every $100 of assets, from $1.35 in 1993.
But such comparisons treat a $10 billion fund the same as a $10 million fund, and thus do not measure the average investor's costs. With new funds being rolled out at the rate of almost 10 a week for much of this decade -- some of them low-cost funds but most of them small, often esoteric funds charging higher-than-average expenses -- it should not be a surprise that unweighted average expense ratios rose.
By contrast, Kanon Bloch uses asset-weighting in its calculations, giving twice as much weight to a $100 million fund, for example, as to a $50 million one. On that basis, the average United States diversified stock fund now charges 77 cents in annual expenses for every $100 invested, down from 88 cents three years ago and 92 cents in 1993. Such stock funds constitute the lion's share -- 80 percent -- of stock mutual fund assets.
The calculations include only the share classes with the most assets or longest records -- usually the class A shares. But William Dougherty, president of Kanon Bloch, said the expense ratio of other share classes, which make up less than 20 percent of domestic diversified stock fund assets, have also been falling. Moreover, the firm's calculations do not include sales charges, or loads, which have also been in decline.
Mr. Dougherty acknowledged that Kanon Bloch's findings may seem surprising, but said the trend has been clear for years. He calculates that investors are saving $3.8 billion this year because of the decline in asset-weighted expense ratios.
SKEPTICS might say the industry's fees look lower under asset-weighting because of the frugality of the Vanguard Group, the index fund king. Vanguard, as a mutual company owned by its customers, does not have to make a profit for public shareholders. The total asset-weighted expense ratio for Vanguard's domestic diversified stock funds declined by one-fifth during the last six years, to 28 cents for every $100 invested, according to Kanon Bloch.
But it isn't just Vanguard. And it isn't just the Kanon Bloch figures. In a report this year, Scott Cooley, a Morningstar analyst, found that even excluding low-cost index funds and institutional shares, asset-weighted costs for investors have dropped by one-quarter since 1984 for load funds and by about 9 percent for no-load funds. He attributed much of the decline to investors' seeking out lower-cost fund families.
In fact, asset-weighted expenses have fallen at the four biggest fund families -- Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, American Funds and Putnam Investments, which, combined, have 43 percent of the total United States diversified stock fund assets. That decline has come in part because swelling assets have touched off break-point clauses in fund management agreements that call for lower fees. Fidelity, for example, charges a two-pronged management fee, one part of which declines as the company's total assets rise. That part of the fee was 0.2863 percent of assets in December 1998, down from 0.2942 percent the year before and 0.3243 percent at year-end 1993. The company has also given up a portion of its fees to some investors in recent years, because performance has not met targets.
From May 1993 to May 1999, Fidelity's expense ratio for diversified stock funds fell by one-third, to 0.63 percent, while the ratio at the American Funds group declined 11 percent, to 0.61, according to Kanon Bloch. It even fell at the relatively pricey Putnam, to 0.95, a 15 percent drop over the period.
Of course, whatever the fee cuts at some fund companies, they pale next to huge revenue gains, as assets under management in stock funds soared 44-fold, to $3.2 trillion, in the 15 years ended in May, according to data from the Investment Company Institute, the industry trade group.
Noting such huge profits, critics say fees should have plunged, not just drifted downward. A Congressional subcommittee heard testimony last fall, and now the General Accounting Office is investigating the matter at the request of Representatives John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican. If any legislation is proposed, it will most likely seek to improve disclosure of fees to investors, Congressional aides say.
Mutual fund officials defend the industry's fees, noting that a study last year by the Investment Company Institute found that fund companies had, in fact, been passing along savings to fund shareholders.
Regardless of what Congress does or does not do, the outlook for investors is good. Plenty of factors already at play suggest that investors will, on average, pay lower fees in the future. The factors include these:
 
INDEXING -- Increasingly sought by investors, index funds accounted for an astonishing 43 percent of all new cash flows into stock funds so far this year, according to AMG Data Services, a mutual fund researcher. The expense ratios on funds that track the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index generally range from 0.18 to 0.40.
The popularity of index funds is being tested, now that many actively managed funds are outperforming the S.& P. 500 over several months for the first time in a half-dozen years. But if history is any guide, the outperformance of the actively managed funds will eventually lapse.
 
GROWING SOPHISTICATION -- Individual investors are becoming savvier about fees, especially as they notice commissions for on-line stock trades dropping sharply.
In February, Mr. Cooley of Morningstar took the mutual fund industry to task for not passing along its huge economies of scale. He also noted that investors were increasingly factoring fees into their fund-buying decisions.
"There is this misconception out there that all investors are stupid, that they chase performance and don't pay attention to fees," Mr. Cooley said. But, he added, "we found that people were migrating toward lower-cost funds and lower-cost families."
At Charles Schwab, the huge San Francisco-based discount broker, executives creating an in-house funds group a decade ago studied institutional money managers and observed that they emphasized low management fees more than the retail market did. Figuring that small investors would eventually follow suit, they decided to make index funds their primary offering. That bet proved prescient.
"As investors have become more and more educated about the role of fees, we are beginning to see a trend of fees being more of a determinant in fund selection," said Bill Klipp, president of Charles Schwab Investment Management.
 
COMPETITION -- More low-cost fund options are becoming available. Schwab's funds have become top sellers, posting the ninth-largest net sales of any fund group in the first five months of the year, according to the Financial Research Corporation, an investment researcher in Boston.
Barclays Global Investors, meanwhile, the huge San Francisco-based institutional money manager that specializes in indexing, plans to sell about 50 index funds on the American Stock Exchange beginning next year.
And TIAA-CREF, the low-cost fund and annuity provider that already dominates the retirement markets at colleges and universities, has gotten off to a strong start with a new line of very low-cost retail mutual funds that combine indexing with active management. The expenses on the funds range from 0.30 to 0.49 percent, according to Morningstar.
Over all, however, there has been a slowdown in the number of new funds -- the kinds that seem to have skewed expense ratio tallies in the past -- as well as in the total net assets flowing into mutual funds. Only 11 new funds were rolled out in the first three months of 1999, about one-tenth the rate of the last three years, according to Cerulli Associates, a financial-services consulting firm in Boston.
 
401(K) MUSCLE -- The shift to low-cost funds has been particularly pronounced among the executives and consultants who select investments for 401(k)'s and other employer-sponsored retirement plans. Analysts estimate that these plans contribute about one-third of the new cash flowing into mutual funds.
In years past, analysts say, expenses played less of a role in the selection of funds for 401(k)'s by corporations. But that is changing. "I would say fees to participants have moved up" in importance, said Steve Butler, president of Pension Dynamics, a pension consulting firm in Lafayette, Calif. "In smaller companies where owners and key managers have a major proportion of the assets, I would say costs are the No. 1 factor."
 
CONSOLIDATION -- If analysts are correct and the fund industry is maturing, consolidation of fund companies could also play a role in allowing them to reduce costs, if they care to. After all, the trend lets them spread a greater amount of assets over a similar base of fixed costs.
But more important for building economies of scale has been the high number of mergers involving funds themselves. Hundreds of funds combine every year. While that should raise a red flag to investors -- fund companies can merge a poor performer with a good one and then use the better fund's track record for marketing purposes -- it also makes it easier to lower expenses.
And the merger trend is expected to continue. "I suspect you'll see more of that," said Mark L. Constant, a fund industry analyst with Merrill Lynch in San Francisco.
 
THE MARKETS -- Many analysts think that stock market returns will revert to their historical averages. And when that happens, investors are certain to pay more attention to fees. Over the last decade, the S.& P. 500 has risen an average of almost 20 percent a year. That compares with its post-1926 average of about 11 percent a year. Given that almost anyone in a diversified stock fund has made a lot of money in recent years regardless of the fees he paid, it is surprising that investors have paid any attention to costs.
But "there's going to be a growing cost awareness if the rates of return available in the marketplace turn out to be a lot lower in the next decade," said James F. Rothenberg, president of Capital Research and Management, the Los Angeles investment-advisory firm for the American Funds group. "Then I think people will start to focus a lot more on what are the elements of their results, including what are the costs."
Funds with higher expense ratios will, of course, take a much bigger slice of an investor's profits when returns are lower: losing 1.5 percent of your return to expenses is easy to shrug off when your fund returns 25 percent a year, but not when it returns 7 or 8 percent.
And the cost of fees is compounded over time, even if all other factors remain equal.
Consider the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which has had annual expenses of about 20 cents for every $100 in assets invested over the last decade. Had you invested $10,000 each year, beginning at the start of 1989, you would have had almost $332,000 after 10 years.
But if you took the same fund and replaced Vanguard's low expenses with the average expense ratio of United States diversified stock funds, which was 1.44 percent last year, you would be left with about $311,000, or a difference of $21,000, according to Pension Dynamics.
Despite the asset-weighted numbers, some industry officials, even those who proselytize for lower fees, scoff at the idea that the industry has been broken of greedy habits.
John C. Bogle, Vanguard's founder, bluntly describes the industry's attitude this way: "Croupier, croupier, croupier, where is thy rake?"
And John H. Biggs, chief executive of TIAA-CREF, questions whether fund companies will lower fees anytime soon.
"It's hard for me to imagine them coming down in normal times," he said.
Industry executives note that compensation to fund managers has increased, especially as hedge funds have offered huge packages to top stock pickers. Moreover, public fund shareholders are demanding higher earnings, and the continuing bull market in stocks is keeping investors from complaining too much about fees.
But costs are a certainty, while market-beating performance never is. Study after study has shown that funds with low expense ratios outperform those with higher expenses over time.
"That's something we have found over and over," said Mr. Cooley, the Morningstar analyst.

Chart: "A Surprising Decline"
Conventional wisdom says the average expense ratio of mutual funds, the percentage of investor assets paid to fund companies, has been flat or up over the last several years. But by adjusting the ratios to reflect assets in the funds, it becomes clear that investors are paying less than they were six years ago. Expense ratios are as of May each year, generally based on the largest share class of each fund.

Chart: "Expenses Matter"
Differences in expense ratios add up over time. For example, investing $10,000 in a low-expense fund, the Vanguard 500, starting in 1989, would have resulted in a portfolio worth $20,742.02 more by early 1999 than if it had charged the average fund's expense ratio. By 2009, assuming those expense ratios and 10 percent annual gains, the difference would be $144,643.66.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
After a Dark Year, the Asian Sky Is Filled With Fireworks

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
WHAT a difference a year makes. Last Fourth of July weekend, American investors were basking in the glory of 22.9 percent and 30.4 percent gains in their domestic and European stock funds, respectively, over the previous 12 months. But Asia funds were down more than 52 percent.
This year, it is the Asian funds that are lighting up investors' eyes, amid sentiment that most of the region's financial crisis has passed. 
 In the last 12 months, funds that invest in the Pacific Rim outside of Japan soared 69.35 percent, on average, including 38.17 percent in the second quarter alone, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. Funds that invest in Japan alone were also up substantially -- an average of 55.81 percent over the last year for the 12 months.
By contrast, domestic equity funds rose 14.6 percent in the 12 months and 8.98 percent in the second quarter, while European funds were down 4.72 percent for the year, including a 2.61 percent gain in the quarter. Over all, international stock funds rose 11.3 and 10 percent, respectively.
The portfolio managers of three top performers among funds that buy foreign stocks discussed the turnaround -- as well as new opportunities and possible red flags.
 
The South Korean Bounce
A good gauge of how far up, and how far down, Asian markets have been recently is the Matthews Korea I fund. It was the top-performing international stock fund for the second quarter and the last 12 months, according to Morningstar, with gains of 69.73 percent and 278.5 percent, respectively. But in 1997, the year the Asian crisis erupted, the fund, which has virtually all of its assets in South Korea, was down 64.75 percent.
The South Korean stock market was among the hardest hit during the crisis and one of the earliest to bounce back strongly, said G. Paul Matthews, manager of the fund. A big reason for the rapid rebound was the Government's aggressive economic restructuring.
Three types of companies have driven the fund higher: manufacturing exporters that have benefited from a weak currency, including Samsung Electronics; financial services companies that have adopted Western business practices or sought foreign capital, including Kookmin Bank and Hana Bank, and companies tied to domestic consumption, including phone companies, department stores and utilities.
Mr. Matthews particularly likes Korea Telecom, the largest telephone company in South Korea. It is already fairly efficient, because the Government held down rate increases in recent years. And in a newly deregulated environment, the company will be able to raise phone rates, Mr. Matthews said. The only drawback for prospective investors, he added, is that the company's American depository receipts are now selling at a premium to the local shares, because of limits on foreign ownership of local shares. He bought the A.D.R.'s when they were first offered in May at $27.56 each, representing half a local share. The A.D.R.'s ended the quarter at $40. The local shares, meanwhile, gained 84.6 percent in the quarter, to end at 76,800 won, or $66.35.
Another favorite is the Korea Electric Power Company, or Kepco, the monopoly electric utility in South Korea. The fund has owned local shares since December 1996, when it paid 37,193 won each. They rose 62.5 percent in the quarter, ending at 48,100 won, or $41.56.
 
A Boon in Financial Stocks
Another top-performing fund focused on the Pacific Basin, although with a broader approach, was Montgomery Emerging Asia. In the last 12 months, the fund, with most of its assets in Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan, has soared 97.44 percent, up 61.16 percent in the second quarter alone. Frank Chiang, the fund's manager, said performance was spurred by sharp declines in interest rates that have sent money into the stock markets.
Some of the biggest gainers have been financial services stocks; Mr. Chiang's holdings include Thai Farmers Bank and the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand. He bought shares of Thai Farmers Bank in October at 20 baht. The shares rose 50 percent in the quarter, ending at 114 baht, or $3.09. And he made 300 percent, including currency and capital gains, on Industrial Finance since he bought it at 9 baht a share in January 1998, when the baht was weak. For the quarter, the stock doubled, ending at 23.5 baht, or 64 cents.
Mr. Chiang said he thought financial stocks would continue to profit as the Asian recovery accelerated.
A current favorite is HSBC Holdings, the global, London-based bank with roots in Hong Kong and Shanghai. It has not only weathered the Asian economic storm; it has gained strength by expanding its business in South Korea. He first bought the stock in 1996 at $140 (Hong Kong) a share. It rose 17.7 percent in the quarter, ending at $286 (Hong Kong) or $36.86 (United States).
 
Adjusting to Global Shifts
Some fund managers who scour the world for opportunity are increasing their commitment to Asia.
"Asia looks better today than I've seen it in 10 years," said Paul C. Warren, senior portfolio manager at the Putnam Diversified Equity fund, one of the best-performing global funds over the last five years. It has returned 20.87 percent, annualized, since mid-1994 and is up 19.24 percent in the last 12 months.
In the last five years, the majority of its assets have been in the hot United States stock market, but Mr. Warren is redeploying some money to Asia. At year-end 1998, 51 percent of the fund was in domestic stocks, 41 percent in European and 5.5 percent in Asian; it now has 42 percent in the United States, 37 percent in Europe and 13 percent in Asia. (The rest is in Latin America and Canada.)
Two years ago, Mr. Warren said, three factors were at work: interest rates in much of Asia were a lot higher than in the United States; Asian countries were running large current account deficits -- in essence, borrowing heavily from abroad -- and Asian companies had overdiversified. Now, interest rates in Asia are as low as or lower than those in the United States, current accounts are in surplus and Asian companies are restructuring. As such, "we have a better-than-Goldilocks scenario," he said.
Among Mr. Warren's favorites is Nikko Securities, the third-largest brokerage firm in Japan. Eighteen months ago, it hired a new president, who is cutting costs. As the Japanese economy recovers and retail investors return to the market, "this stock has the potential to be one of our biggest gainers," he said. The fund first bought the stock in late 1998 at around 400 yen a share. It rose 41.8 percent in the quarter, ending at 780 yen, or $6.44.
 
A Count of Caveats
In light of the outsized recent gains for Asia-Pacific funds, investors should be wary, the managers said.
A big part of those returns, they noted, came as local currencies rose from depressed levels. Also, it is still early in the region's recovery, and Asian companies have yet to prove that their reorganizations will translate into consistently higher profits.
Finally, despite the recent surge, many investors who have held Asia-Pacific funds over the last five years still have net losses. The average diversified fund is down 0.22 percent in that period.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Second Opinions;
The Hard Lessons Of Health Reform

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MIDWAY through announcing his proposal to revamp Medicare last week, President Clinton seemed to notice that there were ghosts in the room.
He recalled the first time he came face to face with the suffering of older Americans forced to choose between medicine and food -- during the rough, recessionary days of the 1992 Presidential campaign, when the plight of the uninsured and the under-insured burst into the public's consciousness. 
 "That was almost seven years ago," Mr. Clinton said, somewhat ruefully, "but it still happens today."
At that moment, Mr. Clinton's new proposal for Medicare, the giant Federal health program for the elderly and the disabled, seemed to be something more than another ritualistic exercise in policy-making by a waning Administration.
It seemed, instead, to be one last attempt to come to grips with a nation's contradictory desires on health care, and an acknowledgement of the hard lessons learned in the past seven years. There were, indeed, a lot of ghosts in the room, from the bright-eyed Clintonians who tried, and failed, to reconstruct the American health care system in 1993, to the confident Republicans who tried, and failed, to overhaul the Medicare system in 1995.
The struggle over health care, in retrospect, was one of the defining political conflicts of the 1990's. And most of its tensions were evident again last week as Mr. Clinton unveiled his plan to fortify Medicare's finances, add prescription drugs to its benefits and spur more competition for its beneficiaries among private plans.
Once again, Congress and the White House faced a debate over how to hold down costs while still delivering high-quality care. Once again, the subtext was how much faith to place in the corporate sector and the power of the marketplace, and how much trust to reserve for the Government.
And once again, politicians were asking how much Americans were willing to spend to insure that the technological revolutions of modern medicine -- like the newest, most expensive prescription drugs -- are available and affordable to those who need them.
In one forum or another, those issues have been debated since a little-known Pennsylvania Democrat, Harris Wofford, put health care reform on the political map by riding it to victory in a 1991 Senate race. For all the struggle over health care, though, only the murkiest consensus has emerged. At the end of the day, said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group, "there's a broad sense that nothing's easy in health policy and there are no magic solutions."
The latest Clinton plan is a sadder-but-wiser guess at what is still feasible and politically palatable among the grand theories and principles that have dominated health care thinking over the past 10 years. It is perhaps most striking for what it doesn't do. As Marilyn Moon, a health care analyst at the Urban Institute in Washington, put it, the plan "doesn't lock us into big-time structural change before we really know where we want to go."
INDEED, the Clinton proposal seeks a mixed solution of managed care (health maintenance organizations and other entities that try to control costs and coordinate care) and traditional fee-for-service medicine (in which patients have a free choice of doctors reimbursed by the Government).
Administration officials say their new plan would protect and buttress traditional Medicare for anyone who chooses it while creating new incentives for competition among private health care plans for Medicare beneficiaries.
"It's not radical restructuring, but it's not incremental reform either," said Robert Reischauer, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
It is, in a sense, another Clintonian compromise, this time between the ardent defenders of traditional Medicare and the true believers in the marketplace, who argue that the Government has never really given managed care plans a fair shot at competing for Medicare business.
But it also reflects a more realistic appraisal of ideas that once looked so promising. In 1993, there was a lot more hubris: When the Administration first attempted to restructure the rest of the health care system, many of its health planners saw managed care and a well-organized marketplace as nothing short of wondrous in their ability to control costs and improve quality.
Today, after a private sector revolution that pushed most working Americans into managed care with mixed results, a lot of that euphoria is gone.
"I think there's hardly anybody left who really believes we're on the dawn of offering dramatically better service to people at a lower price," said Robert Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health at Harvard University.
In fact, this month the Senate will begin debate on legislation to create a "patients' bill of rights" to protect consumers in the new world of managed care.
Moreover, Medicare's experience with managed care in the past few years has hardly been an unalloyed success. Last week, H.M.O.'s announced further pullbacks from the Medicare market as well as benefit cuts and premium hikes, claiming the Government has been underpaying them.
Advocates of making Medicare more like a private health care market say such difficulties are a result of too much Government regulation. But others say Medicare needs to move cautiously, given the difficulties of shifting an older, medically vulnerable population into the private marketplace.
THE Clinton plan also tries to deal with a longstanding question of access to health care: It proposes prescription drug coverage in Medicare, at a time when new pharmaceuticals offer extraordinary promise to older Americans but confront them with extraordinary expense. This proposal, too, reflects the sadder-but-wiser approach to health policy; most expansions of benefits or coverage since the failure of the Clinton effort in 1993-94 have been discrete, focused efforts like this, from protections for people changing jobs in 1996 to coverage for uninsured children in 1997.
It is noteworthy, perhaps, that even when the Government is awash in surpluses, there is very little serious discussion in Washington these days about reducing the vulnerability of the 43 million uninsured Americans.
"If we ever get closer to universal coverage, it'll be through a hundred incremental programs, because of the legacy of extraordinary cynicism and distrust of government," Mr. Blendon predicts.
At the beginning of the health care wars, of course, Mr. Clinton promised to give every American a health security card and the benefits to go with it. The collapse of his plan was seen as such a repudiation of government that few politicians dare broach the subject of universal coverage these days.
Some analysts believe that it will take a crisis -- perhaps a major economic downturn and an even greater increase in the numbers of uninsured -- before that issue rises to the top of the agenda again.
Mr. Clinton may be long gone by that time; the Medicare proposal may be his last on health care. It is almost certainly less than what he thought he would accomplish when health care first arose in the 1992 campaign.
But no one considers passage of his plan, or some equivalent, to be a sure thing.
Among the ghosts in the room last week was President Lyndon B. Johnson, political godfather of Medicare, quoted by Mr. Clinton -- and perhaps invoked for his talismanic power.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Uncle Sam Learns Thrift While America Spends

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN announcing last week that the Federal budget surplus would be even more over the next 15 years -- a mind-boggling $1 trillion -- than anticipated a few months ago, President Clinton likened the Government to a profligate consumer suddenly endowed with the means and discipline to get out of debt and save for the future.
"We have now cut up Washington's credit card," Mr. Clinton said. 
 The actual American consumer, however, is not nearly so fiscally virtuous. Minutes before Mr. Clinton said the Treasury might be able to pay off the most important component of the national debt by 2015, the Commerce Department released statistics showing that consumers are headed in the other direction by spending more money than they earn.
The rate of personal savings turned negative last year; total personal spending exceeded total after-tax income. Even as the economy roared along, with jobs plentiful, wages rising and inflation dormant, the savings rate declined to -1.2 percent in May from -1.0 percent in April, the lowest since the Depression.
The public-private dichotomy may not be quite as stark as it seems. Reaping huge Government budget surpluses and wiping out the national debt are just a hope at this point. Everything depends on some sunny economic assumptions and revenue forecasts proving true (the track record so far is not encouraging), and on Washington's willingness to keep its appetite for tax cuts and new spending in check (ditto).
For their part, consumers are not quite so irresponsible as the savings figures suggest. Although they are amassing debt, their overall financial condition is not deteriorating, in large part because the stock market boom and rising real estate values are making them wealthier, at least on paper, even if their cash flow is out of whack. The technical definition of savings includes bank deposits and money invested in stocks, bonds or retirement savings -- basically any after-tax income that a consumer does not spend. But it does not include the capital gains on investments or retirement plans.
Still, the contrast between promised Government rectitude and personal profligacy is jarring. And it was not the only discordant note last week in economic policy.
On the one hand, Mr. Clinton was making the case that one of the great benefits of fiscal responsibility and debt reduction is lower interest rates, since the Government's reduced borrowing needs leaves more capital available for businesses and consumers. On the other, the Federal Reserve was raising rates to snuff out any smoldering inflationary pressures generated by an economy that is already red hot.
Making matters even more complicated, the updated surplus projections led Republicans to step up their push for a big tax cut, which if enacted would stoke the economy even as the Fed is trying to cool it off. (To add to the conundrum, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is one of the most fervent advocates in Washington of lower taxes. Congress is likely to heed his call for another cut in the capital gains tax, which would further fuel the turbo-charged stock market, whose lofty valuations have been keeping Mr. Greenspan awake at night for years.)
THERE'S good news, though. These apparent quandaries are the interwoven byproducts of prosperity.
Take the issue of personal savings and national debt. Arguably, the Government owes its opportunity to reduce the debt to consumers, who as much as any other force have kept the economy and the stock market steaming along and generating the flood of tax revenues that has transformed deficit into surplus.
To the degree that Americans are spendthrifts, it is because they are confident about their own prospects. By opening their wallets, they are creating jobs and fomenting competition that leads to innovation and efficiency. And while their credit card balances might be a bit steep, their household balance sheets are quite healthy if assets like stocks and houses are taken into account.
The ratio of household liabilities to net worth actually declined a bit between 1988 and 1998, to 16.7 percent from 16.9 percent, according to Federal Reserve figures assembled by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment firm based in London. Rising debt was more than offset by an increase in assets, especially stocks, which last year accounted for a quarter of all household assets, up from 10 percent a decade earlier.
A negative savings rate is indeed a potential problem in the long run, and it is only one of several imbalances that have developed over the course of the long business expansion. Should joblessness rise or the stock market head south, households might quickly find themselves on the financial precipice. The same dynamic could apply to the rapidly growing trade deficit, which so far has been a symbol of the American economy's strength and its ability to absorb imports. A downturn could expose the deficit as a weakness of serious proportions.
But even looking narrowly at the savings rate, the news there is not all bad.
While personal savings is in free fall, the overall national savings rate -- by far the more important economic indicator -- has been rising. That is because the Government has become a "saver" in economic terms in the past few years as budget deficits have turned to surpluses and the Treasury has begun paying down the national debt.
Then there is the question of whether debt reduction is even the best way to use the fiscal windfall. Mainstream economic thought says yes. That position dovetails with the broad political consensus that a crucial component to shoring up the ailing entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, is getting the Government on sounder financial footing before the vast baby-boom generation retires.
BUT some conservatives say focusing on paying down the debt dilutes support for tax cuts, which they see as a far more potent way of stimulating additional growth. Some liberals fear that concentrating on debt reduction will divert attention from needed investments in education, health care and poverty fighting, all issues essential to the country's long-term prospects.
Hanging over the debate is an even bigger question: Are the surpluses for real?
The answer is that nobody knows. It was only a few years ago that the problem of budget deficits appeared intractable. Today's fiscal optimism could prove equally transitory.

President Clinton said last week that the most important component of the national debt could be wiped out by 2015 by taking advantage of huge projected budget surpluses. But budget projections are notoriously unreliable. In January 1995, the Congressional Budget Office projected mushrooming Federal deficits through the year 2002. Things haven't gone as expected.

HEADLINE: Why Horse Farms Need To Be Saved

 BODY:
I was glad to read that the County Executive is taking steps to preserve farmland in Westchester ("Trying to Halt the Push of the Bulldozers," June 14). But if Mr. Spano and the Board of Legislators wish to preserve the remnants of the county's agricultural past, they should take immediate action to include "horse farms" under the protection of the state's Agricultural Exemption Act.
The Agricultural Exemption Act (Article 25-AA of the State's Agricultural and Markets Law) was enacted "to conserve and protect agricultural lands as valued natural and ecological resources" as well as "to provide a locally initiated mechanism for the protection and enhancement of this economic and environmental resource of major importance." 
 The act's benefits were originally reserved for more traditional forms of agriculture like growing crops and breeding animals. However, by 1994 it had become clear to state legislators that in New York's less rural counties, horse farms, those that are primarily dependent upon income derived from boarding horses and providing lessons, were among the few agricultural enterprises left to be preserved.
The act was amended effective March 1, 1995, to give counties the option of extending its protections, including real property tax breaks, to horse boarding facilities.
Almost immediately, Putnam County became the first county to opt into the new provisions of the act. Shortly thereafter, Dutchess followed suit. Officials in those counties had determined that it was more economical to preserve horse farms than to develop the land with housing, which would attract a greater population and lead to greater school expenditures. They also knew that a moderate reduction in property taxes would be offset by Federal and state income taxes and county sales taxes collected as new jobs would be created and existing jobs saved. And they emphasized that the benefits to the environment and the general well-being of the community from keeping large tracts of pasture land open were almost incalculable.
In towns like Lewisboro and North Salem, which derive almost no tax revenues from traditional commercial sources, horseback riding accounts for practically all of the nontrade related, moderate-wage jobs. In North Salem, for example, the horse industry is the largest employer and industry.
Westchester's few remaining horse farms preserve scenic vistas and provide recreation. They also pay taxes and create jobs. Any realistic attempt to save agriculture in the county must include these facilities. After being used for centuries to clear farm fields, horses may now be our best means of saving them.

HEADLINE: Can Nonprofits Also Be For-Profits?

 BODY:
I wonder how many readers noticed the rhetorical sleight-of-hand in "New Arts Space Keeps Faith With White Plains" (June 6). State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, who facilitated the $550,000 state grant to the nonprofit Westchester Arts Council, noted the "council's key role in developing the $54.2 million arts industry in Westchester." But the council anticipates for-profit activities in the building described. Evidently, no one questions where nonprofit ends and for-profit begins or why taxpayers who live elsewhere should pay "for the revitalization of downtown White Plains" if local businesses want out.
Convoluted rationales for allocations of public funds to the arts have become commonplace since the fizzled arts boom of the late 1960's and early 1970's. Next, arts groups tried hard to prove that concerts and exhibitions delivered economic benefits. In fact they did, but only to a limited number of small businesses. Large corporations either received tax rebates or relocated their facilities, without reference to employee interests. 
 With that finding, it became clear that unless major givers foot bills (which they were unwilling to do), government was the only major source of financing left. Bureaucrats in Albany and Washington nonetheless demanded that prospective beneficiaries demonstrate entrepreneurial skills. Thus the tragicomic spectacle of arts nonprofits receiving public funds to demonstrate their capabilities to operate as for-profits, But if they could do that, why would they have gone to government in the first place?

How to Corral an Expanding Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The alternative minimum tax, enacted 30 years ago to make sure that every rich person pays some income taxes, is increasingly a burden on the middle class. But fixing it is easy, according to a report by the staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.
Years of inflation have so distorted the tax that taxpayers with as little as $27,404 in adjusted gross income can be subject to the A.M.T. this year, but the issue gets little play from Washington politicians polishing their images as tax cutters. 
 A few years ago, virtually no one making $75,000 to $100,000 paid the tax. But this year, the committee estimated, one in eight A.M.T. taxpayers will be in that income group. Some middle-class taxpayers who are affected by the A.M.T. will not get the full $500-a-child tax credit.
The fix? Index the tax for inflation.
If that is done now, the committee estimated, the 823,000 taxpayers who will pay the A.M.T. this year will grow to just one million in 2009, instead of the nine million projected otherwise. If no changes are made, A.M.T. revenues, now $3.9 billion, will be $19.8 billion in 2009; if indexing were adopted now, they would rise to only $5.9 billion. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

In Market After Market, a Summer Rally

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
Records dropped like flies in the hot summer sun last week.
 On Wednesday, investors in Japan pushed the Nikkei 225 index to a new high for the year, bolstered by data that suggested a recovery was under way. 
 In Seoul, a rally on Thursday in response to the Federal Reserve's change in bias on American interest rates spilled over to Friday, as the Korea composite index crossed into record territory.
 Also on Friday, the Hang Seng index reached its highest level since Oct. 9, 1997, and had its biggest one-day gain in three months. Malaysia's composite index reached its highest level since September 1997. The Straits Times index in Singapore hit a record. And the Xetra DAX in Frankfurt closed at a high for this year.
 In the United States, the Dow industrials, at 11,139.24, and the Nasdaq, at 2,741.02, surpassed previous highs, marking the best week for stocks since last October.
 Giddy investors may see the makings of an extended rally. We felt we'd see a summer rally in stocks up to 11,500 on the Dow, so we're more than halfway home, Philip Orlando, chief investment officer for Value Line Asset Management, told Bloomberg News. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: For Swiss, Some Soul Searching After Losing a Bid for Olympics

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 3

 BODY:
Like chocolate, cheese, precision watches, the Red Cross, skiing and banking, the Olympic movement has been linked for decades with Switzerland. The city of Lausanne has long been headquarters for the International Olympic Committee and home to its spectacular lakeside museum.
So it has been doubly infuriating for the Swiss to endure what is widely perceived as the latest blow to their national pride: the decision to award the 2006 Winter Olympics not to the front-running Alpine resort of Sion, but to an upstart Italian rival, the industrial city of Turin. 
 The unexpected and very public blow came when Switzerland was climbing out of a lengthy economic downturn and beginning to come to terms with the painful revelations of recent years that Swiss actions during World War II may well have been less concerned with self-preservation than with profit.
Sion's loss to Turin sparked street protests and nationwide accusations that the vote was an act of revenge for the Swiss member of the International Olympic Committee who blew the whistle late last year on widespread corrupt practices within the Olympic movement. That led to resignations and expulsions of members of its clubby committee.
Sion's bid for the Winter Games enjoyed widespread popular support and Olympic rings in the red and white Swiss national colors adorned everything from toilet paper to trains. So the rebuff was felt nationwide, and the fury enhanced by knowledge that the committee's formal evaluation gave the edge to Sion, while the 52-to-36 vote went heavily against the Swiss resort.
The rejection prompted a wave of self-examination. One mass circulation daily, Blick, published a survey of foreigners' views of the Swiss, ranging from what it described as the Israeli view that the Swiss are anti-Semitic, to the French observation that they are racist and the American perception of the Swiss as colorless and out for themselves.
"We are pedantic and humorless," Blick concluded." We are bad losers -- that's how the world sees us."
Switzerland has long prided itself on what is nationally seen as self-sufficiency, which in foreign affairs translated into neutrality and choosing not to join either the United Nations or the European Union. Today, however, that attitude is increasingly seen as perilously insular.
Federal Minister Adolf Ogi, who oversaw the unsuccessful bid for the 2006 Games, said afterward in published remarks that despite Switzerland's healthy international economic position, it is "politically alone."
Mr. Ogi, who was photographed visibly shaken when he heard the news announced in Seoul, South Korea, said later: "I heard delegates say they wanted the Swiss to lose. People don't like Switzerland."
No sooner was the disheartened Mr. Ogi's interview published when reports surfaced that the country's role in seeking the Games might not have been squeaky clean. A Swiss newsweekly, L'Hebdo, said Swiss tax officials had overlooked past Olympic Committee tax fraud to smooth the way for Sion's bid. L'Hebdo printed what it said was a secret Government memo that Olympic Committee workers declared lower salaries than they received to avoid taxes.
The Olympic Committee has denied any wrongdoing, saying tax arrangements, often murky in Switzerland for the rich and famous, were longstanding and legitimate. Swiss officials also denied wrongdoing.
Last month, a rare alliance of conservative and left-leaning political parties blocked a constitutional amendment that would have enabled Switzerland to sell some of its gold reserves to finance the Solidarity Foundation, which was started to help victims of poverty and disaster.
The opponents argued that any benefits from gold sales should go to Switzerland's sagging state pension fund, not to the special fund.
Mr. Ogi, who oversees Swiss defense and sports matters, saw the recent controversy over the country's role during World War II and the Olympic corruption disclosures as part of a "mosaic."
"It also has to do with our attitude," he added. "We think we are the best, we play at being schoolmasters, we give lessons, we wish to profit but not to get involved. We overestimate ourselves." http://www.nytimes.com

HEADLINE: REASON IS SOUGHT FOR LAG BY BLACKS IN SCHOOL EFFORT

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
Taking on one of the most troublesome and contentious issues in American education, school officials and educators around the nation have begun discussing why the academic achievement of black middle-class and upper-income students lags behind whites of comparable socioeconomic status.
On some tests, black students from middle-class or wealthier families have done no better than white students who live in poverty. And some especially puzzling data have suggested that at higher achievement levels, the gap between black and white performance is wider than at lower levels. 
 For example, an analysis of 1995 S.A.T. scores, the most recent such analysis available, showed that students of all races did better if their parents had more education. But blacks whose parents had at least one graduate degree averaged 191 points lower than whites whose parents had the same amount of education, while blacks whose parents had no high school diploma averaged 137 points behind whites whose parents had none.
School officials and black education experts are increasingly troubled by the gap.
"How do we explain the underproductivity of middle-class kids, of able and gifted minority youngsters who come out of situations where you would expect high achievement?" asked Edmund W. Gordon, a professor emeritus of psychology at Yale University and the co-chairman of the National Task Force on Minority High Achievement, formed in 1997 by the College Board. "This is not something that a lot of people feel comfortable talking about."
In one of the most closely watched efforts in education circles, more than a dozen middle-class, racially integrated communities across the country, including Evanston, and two in the New York metropolitan area -- White Plains, and South Orange-Maplewood, N.J. -- have formed a network to learn more about the disparity and try to do something about it. They will scrutinize what happens in schools and classrooms, and will also look at research on the home lives, study habits, and attitudes of black students.
In Evanston, a comfortable, attractive community just north of Chicago, Venessa Woods has a firsthand look at the problem.
Ms. Woods, who runs a high school program to help minority students do better, keeps coming across black students from stable, educated, middle-class families who have fallen behind despite seeming to have all the ingredients for success.
"The first thing that came to my head is 'Oh, they're poor' or 'Oh, they're in a single-parent home,' " said Ms. Woods, who is African-American. "To my surprise, the students were living in the better part of Evanston. Students were living with two-parent families who have college degrees. They have computers. They have personal tutors. And they're getting C's and D's, and why?"
Nobody claims to have clear answers. But from conversations with teachers, students, researchers and parents, the reasons seem to be multilayered, going beyond a student's socioeconomic status to include lingering racial inferiority complexes, peer pressure, low teacher expectations, curriculum, parental involvement and access to information, and vestiges of racism in schools.
Some of the most compelling insights come from students like Akilah Rogers, who just completed her junior year at Evanston Township High School taking advanced placement and accelerated classes, and helped organize a day of student discussion about minority achievement this spring.
"I would say that the most African-Americans in one of my honors classes is three," said Akilah, who is 17. Early on, she said, "People were like, 'Oh, you're an oreo.' Getting good grades was always connected to white people. So they're like, 'Are you going to be white and achieve?' "
 
In Chicago Suburb, Numbers Defy Logic
The 14 schools in the network are mostly top-notch, with high per-pupil spending, many middle-class families and diverse student populations. At these schools, middle-class blacks typically perform better than poor blacks and often score above the national and state average for African-Americans. Many are in university towns like Berkeley, Calif., Chapel Hill, N.C., and Amherst, Mass. But they still perform worse on average than whites.
"These are areas in the country where you would think you would get people being high achievers, but it's not happening to the degree it should," said Allan Alson, superintendent of Evanston's high school, who is concerned about what schools like his should be doing differently.
At Evanston, 42 percent of the high school's 2,900 students are black. And while there is poverty here -- about 30 percent of the students, mostly blacks, receive free or reduced-price lunches -- there is also a solid black middle class. Evanston provides after-school, summer and weekend programs for struggling students, and honors and advanced placement courses are open to any student who wants to enroll.
Still, the numbers at Evanston have been disappointing. A study of the first semester of the 1997-1998 school year found that nearly 25 percent of black students had failed at least one class, compared with 4 percent of white students. Seven percent of black students' grades were A's, compared with 25 percent for whites.
In 1996, on a state reading test, 49 percent of African-Americans at the school were reading below grade level, compared with 9 percent of whites. And while the college attendance rate of both blacks and whites here is above the national average, 66 percent of blacks go to college, compared with 95 percent of whites.
Evanston's most recent efforts include hiring more African-American teachers, raising the academic eligibility requirements for participation in sports, increasing the amount of homework, and creating more advanced placement courses.
Students at Evanston and elsewhere say doing well in school is not always accepted by their peers.
Fitzroy Dennison, 18, said he was so conscious of the stigma that he avoided speaking grammatically correct English with friends.
"You learn to switch it off," said Fitzroy, whose parents are from Panama and Belize. "When you're on the streets, you speak Ebonics. When you're at home, you speak Creole. When you're in school, you speak proper English. But when you talk too proper, your peers will call you white and say you're a cracker."
Bruce Eddy, a history teacher at Evanston, recalled that during a class that mixed middle-level and honors students, "a black student came in the room and pointed to a couple of black kids in the room, and one kid got very upset and said, 'He's pointing out that this is an all-white class and there are only a couple of black students in here.' "
 
Some Insight Into the Obstacles
Some clues to the problem might come from students who have achieved in spite of considerable adversity, like Albert Smith, whose family is so poor that he and his parents, four siblings and a nephew often struggle to have enough food.
For Albert, a wiry, energetic 17-year-old, race had a profound effect on his self-esteem in school. As a freshman in history and English honors classes, he said, "the people around me, they were white, and it intimidated me."
"I just thought they were smart because they were white," he added. "I didn't want to raise my hand to answer a question."
That year, Albert's grade point average was 2.7, and he said African-American friends in regular classes treated him like a genius, even when he was not getting the grades he wanted. He started to push himself harder after teachers told him he had potential, and after he started "to become comfortable with all the white people."
By junior year, Albert was averaging 3.6, and he graduated in June, was accepted to several colleges and his classmates voted him best all-around male student.
Albert said he believed that many black students privately respect high achievers, but they "openly praise the people who are doing badly, the people in the gangs, the people who are doing negative things."
He said some seem afraid to try hard because "if they push themselves to the hardest and they don't do well, they think they've failed."
"Then they'll start believing some of the stigmas that are out there in society," Albert said, "that African-Americans aren't as smart as their white counterparts."
Some researchers say differences in home life may affect how well students do. Ronald F. Ferguson, a researcher at Harvard University, has been surveying students at Shaker Heights High School outside of Cleveland, an academically acclaimed school in the new network where most black and white families are solidly middle class. There, while African-Americans make up half the student population, blacks constituted 9 percent of those who graduated in the top fifth of their class, but 83 percent of those in the bottom fifth.
Among other things, Dr. Ferguson found that "black kids watch twice as much TV as white kids; three hours a day as opposed to one and a half hours a day."
National studies have also found differences. One asked students to name the lowest grade they could take home without their parents becoming angry. Blacks consistently named lower grades than Asian, white or Hispanic students.
 
Family Background Comes Into Play
Gloria Ladson-Billings, an education professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said middle-class, college-educated black parents were often the first generation of their families to have such success, so the roots of their academic and economic accomplishments are shallower than many white families.
"For whites, if you go to grandma's house you're maybe going to this huge family library," but for many blacks, grandma's is "a working-class household where people are very proud of what you're doing but they don't have any way of really supporting it."
On their upwardly mobile trajectory, black families may have moved frequently, switching children from school to school, not usually an educational plus.
Dr. Gordon said that because they did not grow up in academically oriented homes, "many minority parents who are serious about their child's education insist that their kids study, do homework, but the same parents are seldom seen by their kids reading a lot or doing anything studious."
Those differences may help account for some test results that showed the gap between black and white achievement on national reading tests and on S.A.T.'s was wider for children whose parents had college or graduate degrees than for children whose parents did not have a high school diploma. (But some researchers say those results might be partly explained by other factors: subtle cultural biases in tests or in schools, the many fewer black parents than white parents with advanced educational backgrounds, or the possibility that black children may have been more likely than whites to overstate or misconstrue their parents' educational history.)
"African-American parents are going to have to step up to the plate and do more," said Martha Burns, an Evanston mother who pushed to get her two children into accelerated elementary school classes, takes them to after-school reading programs and limits television watching. "Anytime you bring this up, people get defensive, insulted and then we just retreat. We really never bring it on the table."
Ms. Burns, a co-president of the P.T.A. council, and experts like Dr. Gordon also said African-American churches and community centers should create more extracurricular academic programs, following the example of, say, Asian-Americans.
But some students and parents say that teachers and guidance counselors, white or black, may, consciously or unconsciously, have lower expectations of African-American students and that this may ultimately translate into self-fulfilling prophecies of mediocrity.
Tanya Bernard, a middle-class 17-year-old who got mostly A's and B's as a junior this year, said that when a counselor discouraged her from taking a Spanish honors class, "I think it may have been a little bit of a racial thing."
Terri Shepard, whose daughter is a student at Evanston, said she believed that early on, many teachers label African-American children as having less potential than whites.
"I don't think teachers expect excellence, and you get what you expect," said Ms. Shepard, a school board member for the lower grades.
That impression, she and others said, can lead parents to distrust schools. The parents may feel less able to act as advocates for their children, less knowledgeable about how to get the attention of teachers, or simply less certain that it will make a difference if they urge their children to strive harder.
"My teachers are not telling me I have to do it; my parents don't tell me I have to do it," said Fitzroy, who graduated this year. "African-American parents, they settle for less, not knowing they can get more for their students."

HEADLINE: Victor A. Bonomo, Maker Of Candy Bars, Dies at 100

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Victor A. Bonomo, who created and marketed Bonomo's Turkish Taffy, the brittle candy bar whose wrapper instructed buyers to smack it and crack it into many edible pieces, died on June 26 at his home in Bal Harbour, Fla. He was 100.
The candy, which first appeared as a nickel bar after World War II, became a favorite with the economy-minded. Unlike some of its competitors, which melted in your mouth, Turkish Taffy eroded slowly, and it was so chewy that a single bar could last through most of a double feature at the movies. 
 Mr. Bonomo (pronounced BAHN-uh-moh) was born into the candy business and actually had Turkish roots. His father, Albert J., was a Sephardic Jew who had emigrated from Turkey. In 1897, the year before Victor Bonomo was born, his father started making candy in Coney Island to supply concessions at the amusement park. After World War I, Victor joined his father in running the candy factory on Eighth Street in Coney Island, where saltwater taffy and hard candies were produced.
As World War II ended, sugar rationing gave way and the entire country was eager to indulge its sweet tooth. Bonomo's joined the race to satisfy the surging demand, promoting three candy bars, "Thanks," "Hats Off" and "Call Again," which Tico Bonomo, Victor's son, described as "poor man's Milky Ways."
Then the candy cooks at the Coney Island factory came up with a batter of corn syrup and egg whites that was cooked and then baked.
"It was not really a taffy but what is technically known as a short nougat," explained Tico Bonomo. Nor was it Turkish. "It was not a family recipe and the name we chose, 'Turkish Taffy,' just reflected clever marketing," he said.
It cooled into sheets the size of school desks, which were distributed through Woolworth stores around the country. Clerks at the candy counters used ball-peen hammers to whack the sheets, breaking off shards that were sold by the pound.
Apparently this method of distribution merely whetted appetites for the candy, then available only in vanilla. Mr. Bonomo had the slabs cut into panels the size of 1945 nickel Hershey bars, which were larger than 1999 65-cent Hershey bars. The bars were packaged in wrappers that showed smiling men in fezzes pouring batter into a huge vat. Of course, in Turkey, the fez had been outlawed by Kemal Ataturk in the 1920's, but back in the 50's the design drew no complaints.
The candy grew popular, eventually being distributed far beyond the metropolitan region into much of the rest of the country. Before the widespread use of air-conditioning, Turkish Taffy had some problems penetrating Southern markets, where warm temperatures turned the bars from hard to gooey. The problem was eventually overcome with new wrappers.
In the 1950's, Bonomo's Turkish Taffy advertised on children's television programs, among them "The Magic Clown" and "Wonderama." The ads featured puppets named Bo, No and Mo. It also sponsored joint promotions with the Duncan yo-yo company.
In time, three new flavors appeared: chocolate, strawberry and banana. According to Tico Bonomo, the company sold 80 million to 100 million bars a year in the 50's and 60's and employed as many as 350 workers at the Coney Island plant, where it also produced hard candy.
Victor Bonomo retired in 1970 and moved to Florida with his wife, Zephra, who survives, as do Tico Bonomo and nine grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Bonomo's Turkish Taffy changed hands a few times, in 1980 becoming part of Tootsie Roll Industries of Chicago, which stopped making the candy in 1989. Ellen Gordon, president of Tootsie Roll Industries, said that the company phased out the product when demand declined as tastes changed.
Probably so, but at least some of the taffy-deprived have turned to the World Wide Web to seek solace from each other, writing of Turkish Taffy with yearnings as evocative as those of Proust for madeleines. Consider this posting on a site called WebFoodPros.com from John R.:
"I have been looking for this taffy for a long time; no other taffy compares. If only I could refrigerate a bar and smack it against the table. Come on, Tootsie Roll, make it again."

HEADLINE: Deluxe Motor Homes Reflect Nation's Booming Economy

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: THORNTOWN, Ind.

 BODY:
It is simple, Clarence and Maryann Cornell said. Financially secure, they wanted to travel and they wanted to do it in comfort and style, their two yelping dachshunds in tow.
With that, the Cornells, owners of two stationary homes -- one in Minnesota, the other in Florida -- explained their latest acquisition: a $112,000 Fleetwood Southwind motor home they had just eased into a spot at Old Mill Run Park, a 67-acre campground with a stream and fishing ponds, amid corn and soybean fields here in central Indiana, 35 miles northwest of Indianapolis. 
 Over a long weekend, they will lounge on leather upholstery in a plushly carpeted living room with expandable walls, cook in a kitchen complete with four-door refrigerator-freezer and bathe in a big tub in their bedroom suite.
"With the dogs," said Mrs. Cornell, who is 40, "the only way to do it is with a motor home."
Mr. Cornell, 69, outside lowering the motor home's built-in awning, shrugged and agreed. "That's the gist of it."
In these days of unparalleled affluence, the Cornells can splurge more than most. He is a semiretired executive; their children are grown. But in their taste for luxury on the road, they are far from alone.
Chariots like that of the Cornells -- and bigger ones, costing up to $1 million, with washers, dryers, tile-walled baths, surround-sound stereos and storage compartments beneath the wheels known as basements -- pull into Old Mill Run Park every day. The one thing that does not often pierce this middle-class campground's horizon of metal boxes on wheels is the peak of a spartan camper's tent.
If there is a place in America that captures how the waning century's longest stretch of prosperity has fogged over memories of recessions, unemployment, inflation, gasoline rationing and sinking stock markets, the American campground is as sure a contender as the thriving marinas of Florida or the shoulder-to-shoulder big houses of suburbia.
While roughing it with bugs, sterno stoves and sleeping bags in the bush still lures many of the hardy and fit, the old conventional campground now more often means trailers with window screens, three-burner stoves, air-conditioning and queen-sized beds.
Motor homes, many of them 300- and 400-horsepower "diesel pushers," as they are called, pull the family car to the campsite, or "duallies," big muscular, $40,000 pickups with four wheels in the rear, haul in the trailers.
It all costs money, far more than the gains in income that most Americans have realized over the last decade. But like the boats and the extra-large houses, a deluxe home on the road is something that many of them will stretch themselves thin to have.
"People are buying more now than they ever did in their life," said John Shufflebarger, who as a salesman at the Indy R.V. Center near Indianapolis supplies some of the vehicles that come here. "I don't believe people in the United States are going to let money or gas prices interfere with their entertainment. As long as the economy is as good as it is now, they're going to go out and have a good time."
For three years, Mary Kay Baker, 36, a cheery preschool teacher, her husband, John, 39, a farmer and water-well driller, and their children, Bradley, 11, and Kristen, 15, have been spending weekends and summer vacations here. A year ago, Mrs. Baker's parents, Bill and Ferne Ferrel, started coming, too, in a trailer of their own.
The Bakers, who earn something under $60,000 a year, put 10 percent down from their savings to buy their $21,000, 35-foot Innsbruck trailer. Unlike many Americans, the Bakers do save something, about 10 percent of their income, but they save to spend, not for the rainy days of unemployment or plunging stocks and bonds.
"I don't remember the recession," Mrs. Baker said, sitting at the family picnic table.
Last year, the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association says the booming economy induced Americans to spend $8.4 billion for nearly 300,000 recreational vehicles, from $3,000 pop-up camping trailers to self-propelled motor-home behemoths, most of which cost $50,000 to $100,000.
In the 1990's through last year, the association says, the industry sold two million vehicles, almost half a million more than in the 1980's. All together, the association says 9.3 million are in service and that 1 in 10 households has one.
A year ago, after many years of camping with their children, Ralph Christman, 47, a former farmer and automobile assembly line worker, and his wife, Sandy, formerly the activities director at a veterans' home, bought Old Mill Run Park.
The park has 347 campsites, with 197 of them renting for $950 for the season that runs from April to October. All of these are taken. Most of the other sites, renting for an average of $21 a day, except for those for tents, are at least two-thirds full on weekdays and tend to fill up on weekends. The vehicle sites have small lawns and easy hook-ups to water and electricity and many to cable television and telephone lines.
People come for the swimming, fishing, the golf course and volleyball, bingo and horseshoe tournaments.
"Everybody's carefree," Mrs. Christman said. Children come into the campground store with $20 bills to buy candy and trinkets and spend it all, she said, adding, "Then they go back and get some more."
As production of R.V.'s has climbed, so have the features on which consumers splurge. Many are equipped with one to three expandable sides, known as slide-outs. These are sections of wall, floor and ceiling that with the push of a button pop out from a vehicle's aluminum hide to create more space inside.
Driven or towed, the bigger vehicles require a gallon of gasoline or diesel oil to travel 7 to 10 miles. But relatively inexpensive fuel, $1 a gallon for gasoline or diesel oil at at a station near this campground, has erased memories of the oil crisis in the mid-1970's, when rationing and soaring prices put the recreational vehicle business in mothballs.
The lush economy has blessed Jack Andres, 65, who retired last year as a utilities engineer at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., and his wife, Janet, 59, who was an administrative secretary there.
They sold their home last year and, with savings and profits, have settled into a 28-foot, single-slide-out trailer that they keep here. They also bought a camper that fits into the bed of their pickup that they take on visits to 11 children from two marriages and to Naples, Fla., the site of their modular home.
"It used to be, camping was your cheap summer vacation," Mrs. Andres said. "Camping is a life style for us now."
With the growth of motorized camping, the age of the motorist has dropped. Almost entirely retirees before the 1990's, the average trailer and motor home owner today is 48, said Jeff Beddow, the industry association's spokesman.
At the Old Mill Run Park, the Christmans's clientele is blue collar and white collar. Postal workers and construction workers reside lot to lot with doctors and executives. They seem universally affluent, in outlook and attitude if not in all cases in assets and income.
Judee and David Duncan, both 58, parents of five children, have a 38.5-foot Fleetwood Avion fifth-wheeler, trailer that hitches into bed of a pickup. It is the Duncans' only home.
Mr. Duncan retired from the Navy, having risen to lieutenant commander, and went to work for the Raytheon Company. Five years ago, at 53, while working 70 hours a week managing a missile assembly plant, he had a heart attack.
"We decided to chuck it all," Mr. Duncan said. "We sold our 3,000-square-foot home, bought a fifth-wheeler and have been on the road since."
The low-inflation economy, Mr. Duncan said, protects the buying power of his $35,000 annual pension from the Navy that he and his wife are living on.
For some other campers here, the decade's prosperity has inspired revisionist thinking about the notions of spending, saving and borrowing.
Harold Rumery, 71, basks under his awning, wearing a T-shirt that says, "I'm a two-steppin' country western dancer." He and his wife, Nancy, 68, used to share driving of a Mayflower moving van, and then he became the company's supervisor of driver training.
"I was in the Depression," Mr. Rumery said. "I was born in 1927. I grew up dirt poor." Gesturing from his patio, he said, "We just bought that '99 Chrysler this year," with 10 percent down. "We had a '96 Mercury. But it was gray and she wanted red, so we just bought it."
Behind Mr. Rumery is his 1999, 36-foot, $22,000 Nomad trailer with two slide-outs. "We just bought it, too," he said, again with 10 percent down.
With pensions, Social Security, Medicare, consulting fees, and a lively stock market, Mr. Rumery said, "We believe we've got the ability to do what we want to do."

HEADLINE: In the Rockaways, Hope for a Revival

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Bill Daly, an 11-year resident on the Rockaway peninsula, has seen ferries come and he has seen ferries go. So it is no wonder that he is a little skeptical of another plan to give the Rockaways daily ferry service to Manhattan.
"There's no real direct route to the city other than the waterway," said Mr. Daly, a stockbroker who commutes more than an hour to Wall Street each day by subway or car. "Any other city in the world would have already tapped into it ages ago, but here we are in New York, and there's nothing." 
 At the urging of City Councilman Alfonso C. Stabile, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey recently completed a preliminary feasibility study that proposes possible ferry landing sites in the Rockaways and suggests an additional stop in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Civic leaders and the local community board had been asking for a government-subsidized ferry service for years as an alternative to the A train, which meanders through Queens and Brooklyn to get to Manhattan.
Few details have been pinned down yet, including where subsidy money would come from and exactly where the ferry would depart from and go to, but city officials hope to solicit bids from private operators to run the ferry by next spring.
Although next summer would be the earliest that a Rockaway ferry service could be up and running, many residents are nonetheless pleased that the Port Authority and other local officials have finally shown some serious interest in the idea. Residents and community leaders said they were hopeful that the ferry, combined with a number of new housing developments and plans for a $1.2 billion sports and entertainment complex on the east end of the peninsula, would be a sign that the long-awaited revival of the Rockaways is finally on the horizon.
"Commuting from Rockaway to Manhattan, on a good day, is a misadventure in transportation," said Jonathan L. Gaska, the district manager of the community board that covers the Rockaways. "To attract working-class families to live here, something has to be done to shorten the commute. There's no question that improving transportation and access in and out would help spur economic development out here."
Councilman Stabile said that the isolation of the peninsula has led residents to "feel like they've been forgotten, and in a lot of ways, they have a right to feel that way."
Ever since the Long Island Rail Road shut down a line that connected the Rockaways to the rest of the city in the 1950's, the only public transportation to the peninsula has been the A train and local buses, options that can take up to 90 minutes to get into Manhattan. People who commute by car must go over two bridges, including one that charges a $1.75 toll each way, just to get to mainland Queens. When traffic is bad, the commute to Manhattan by car can take as long as two hours.
"That's like primitive, that's like the Dark Ages," Mr. Stabile exclaimed. "The Rockaways need a shot in the arm, and to me, the ferry is the best solution to improving the transportation." A ferry would take between 32 and 43 minutes, depending on where it leaves from.
In addition to getting the Port Authority to do a feasibility study, Mr. Stabile has also started exploring possible sources of city and state money to subsidize the ferry in order to keep the fare at about $3 each way. A number of private ferry services operated from the Rockaways in the 1980's and early 1990's, but none lasted more than a few months. Mr. Stabile and Port Authority officials surmise that they failed in part because they charged as much as $7 per trip.
United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner, whose district includes the Rockaways, hopes to bring home part of the transportation funding that the Federal Government set aside last year specifically to increase and improve ferry service across the country. He hopes to use the Federal money to build ferry landings in the Rockaways.
Although city and state subsidies for the ferry ride are yet to be determined, Mr. Weiner said he believed that the different levels of government are committed to the ferry because the lack of transportation alternatives has stunted development in the Rockaways for too long.
"At the end of the day, we're going to be able to get city and Federal support for it," he said. "But getting a private operator to see the same kind of potential we see may be the toughest part of this." He said that few private operators have expressed interest in running a service, and said he hoped that the Port Authority's study would help change that.
After reviewing the demographics of the Rockaways, Port Authority officials concluded that there probably are not enough commuters to support a ferry service. So the Port Authority has recommended an additional stop in Sheepshead Bay, where a ferry could add as many as 1,200 commuters to the estimated 5,000 from the Rockaways.
Charles Meara, manager of state and local relations for the Port Authority, said that the operators who ran ferries in the past failed because they operated very small boats that often did not provide a comfortable ride and ran only during the morning and evening rush hours.
That's why the Port Authority is recommending boats that can operate at 30 knots per hour, roughly the size of the ferries that now travel between Manhattan and Hoboken and from Manhattan to Yankee Stadium and can carry more than 100 passengers. The agency's study also recommends full-time service, including weekend hours to attract Manhattanites who might want to avoid traffic-clogged routes when going to the beach.
The ferry service is just one of many long-talked-about projects in the Rockaways that have finally seen some movement recently.
Dozens of two-family homes are being built in Arverne and Edgemere, sections of the Rockaways where thousands of summer bungalows were razed by the city in the 1960's for urban renewal, but which have seen little development until recently. A private developer also has started building 90 homes on land once used by the Playland amusement park at Beach 98th Street.
Plans for a $1.2 billion sports and entertainment complex called Destination Technodome also have moved ahead, with the developers negotiating with city and state officials for infrastructure development. The Rockaway Chamber of Commerce also has been working with a developer to turn the area around Beach 116th Street into an entertainment seaport site, possibly with a gambling boat, dinner cruises and new shops. Beach 116th Street is also one of the recommended sites for a ferry landing.
And the city has finally started to pay some attention to the deteriorating boardwalk along the beach. City crews completely rebuilt the boardwalk between Beach 116th and Beach 109th Streets a few months ago and plan to do more in the fall.
"We're obviously very pleased with everything that's going on," Mr. Gaska said. "Six or seven years ago, Rockaway couldn't get itself arrested as far as any kind of development was concerned. People maybe finally are realizing what a hidden gem we are."

HEADLINE: Flush Times and Hungry Republicans Generate Bush Campaign Windfall

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush's colossal $36.3 million campaign treasury was built on three pillars: a home-court advantage that allowed him to hit up Texas supporters, enthusiastic support from Republican governors, and the vast fund-raising network of his father, the former President.
But it is a fourth pillar that has catapulted the Governor of Texas to fund-raising heights never before seen in Presidential politics: the burning desire of hungry Republicans, made fat by seven years of economic growth and frustrated by Democratic control, to regain the Presidency. 
 In interviews with dozens of people who have donated to Mr. Bush or raised money for him, as well as strategists inside and outside the campaign, the refrain is common: donors sound practically breathless with excitement. They said they had showered the Bush campaign with money because they find the candidate charismatic and, more important, they view him as a winner.
"There's a tremendous amount of money available out there today," James E. Gilleran, 66, chairman of the Bank of San Francisco, said on his way out of a packed Bush fund-raiser in his city on Wednesday. "So all a candidate has to do is evidence the possibility of winning. And this is a guy who exudes the possibility of winning when we've got a Republican Party extremely desirous of winning back the White House."
Mr. Gilleran is a veteran Republican donor. But at the same event, Erik C. Weir, 32, president of a capital management company, said similar reasons had prompted him to attend a fund-raiser for the first time in years. "He's the first candidate in a long time that has a real chance of making it," Mr. Weir said.
At a Bush fund-raising breakfast the next morning in Palo Alto, Gregory W. Slayton, 39, the chief executive officer of MySoftware Company, put it this way: "The Silicon Valley is not about losing. It's about winning."
John Gable, 34, a product manager for Netscape who was at the event, gushed, "I've never written a $1,000 check before. But there's something to this personal connection when he looks you in the eye. There's a there there. It's a craving to be proud."
Because of that hunger for Mr. Bush, he has not had to spend one minute on the telephone pleading for donations -- a luxury not enjoyed by most other candidates. "Pick up the phone and dial for contributions?" Mr. Bush asked in an interview on Friday. "Not at all."
Mr. Bush simply shows up at fund-raising events. And he rarely mentions money at them. He doesn't have to; most people who attend these events have already given $1,000, the maximum individual contribution allowed by law.
In his only mention of contributions, Mr. Bush said at the gala this week in San Francisco, "I want to thank each and every one of you for writing a check." The campaign has raised some money through mailings, and plans to begin telephone solicitations within 30 days, said Don Evans, Mr. Bush's national finance chairman and best friend.
Mr. Evans, an oil company executive from Midland, Tex., said: "This isn't a hard-sell operation. People tell me this is the easiest money they've ever raised. That is the universal theme."
Mr. Evans said that, buoyed by a week of sold-out, record-breaking events, he realized on June 25, on a corporate jet taking the Bush team from one sold-out fund-raiser in Detroit to another in Fort Myers, Fla. that the campaign might pass the $30 million mark. .
At an event earlier in Michigan, for example, Governor John M. Engler marveled that the campaign collected $40,000 at the door from walk-ins -- people who had not bought their tickets in advance. "That has never happened before," Mr. Engler said. "This is a phenomenon that we haven't seen."
In something of a victory lap, Mr. Evans approached table after table at the Palo Alto event, telling donors: "I want to say thank you. It's history in the making."
No Presidential candidate had ever amassed that much money even over an entire primary season; Mr. Bush did it in four months. And Mr. Bush's money machine is only warming up. He has yet to tap potential donors in many states, including New York and New Jersey, which are always vital stops on the money circuit. Mr. Evans noted that the campaign has thus far picked only "the low-hanging fruit" on the finance tree.
The windfall gives Mr. Bush an enormous advantage over his Republican rivals, as well as over Vice President Al Gore, who has taken in only about half as much money. It may also be a harbinger of what could be the most expensive campaign season in history, given the open contest for the White House, a tight race for control of Congress and what appear to be several hard-fought Senate races in New York and other states.
Despite what one Bush aide called the "spontaneous combustion" from donors, the operation is all the more potent because of the critical advantages he has over his rivals.
Mr. Bush tapped into a vast statewide fund-raising network he had cultivated in his two races for Governor. About half the money he collected in the first quarter of the year came from Texas.
While Mr. Bush has not had to hit up donors on the telephone personally, his father, former President George Bush, and other Governors have done some of the work for him.
The fund-raising connections of the Governor's father helped the campaign get off to a swift start. President Bush was no slouch at raising money; he established "Team 100," a loyal network of $100,000 givers that helped the party and his own Presidential campaigns.
In the first quarter of the year, the Bush organization took in roughly 15 percent of its contributions from people who had donated to the elder Bush. The former President has also pitched in by appearing as the star attraction at fund-raising events for his son and by helping raise money for lawmakers who are backing the Governor. The younger Mr. Bush said that on Friday morning he had chatted with his father about the $36.3 million. "He was proud and amazed," the Governor said.
The Republican governors who have played crucial roles are Governor Engler; Mr. Bush's brother, Jeb, in Florida, and Governors Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and John G. Rowland of Connecticut. They have leaned on their own financial networks to raise money for Mr. Bush, something that the 1996 Republican Presidential nominee, Bob Dole, did not accomplish.
"They're deeply involved with George Bush," Governor Engler said, "and they were not with Bob Dole. I don't think Bob, Senator Dole, understood how you could use governors effectively. It's night and day -- and makes a huge difference."
While the Bush fund-raising operation has been geared more to managing the inward torrent of money than soliciting donors, the Bush organizers have not been as passive as campaign officials suggest. The campaign has established an elite group of about 200 supporters, called "the Pioneers," who have each agreed to raise $100,000 from their friends and associates. (About half have met the goal, campaign officials say.) The campaign refused to disclose the names of the Pioneers. "A lot of people would just as soon not have their name released," Mr. Evans said. "We owe them the courtesy of keeping that private."
Although Mr. Bush has not had to solicit personally, his minions have not been shy. "A pretty amazing thing is that when I first got asked for money and I told the guy I would do it," said one well-connected donor who spoke on the condition of anonymity, "the next day they called me and said, 'Can you put your check in overnight?' It's a mindset. It's one thing to get pledges, but their turnaround must be impressive."
Still, the financial frenzy seems more grounded in Mr. Bush's personal appeal than in the people pushing his virtues. It is all the more striking because Mr. Bush is not particularly well-known nationally and his positions on issues are largely a mystery, although he has presented himself as a "compassionate conservative" with broad appeal.
"He's so untested and undefined, but the Republican elite have in an extraordinary way rallied to this candidate," said David B. Magleby, a political scientist at Brigham Young University. "It is probably in their antipathy to Clinton and their sense that he's head and shoulders above the other candidates. It's the gap between Bush and the others that's quite remarkable."
Asked in the interview whether donors were motivated because they see him as a winner, Mr. Bush said, "I think that's true." He added that "there's all kinds of reasons we've done well."
At a series of fund-raising events in California this week, in which the Bush campaign drew roughly $5 million, he was met by overflow crowds. "The California team was amazed," Mr. Bush said. "The people involved in the fund-raising were smiling the whole time. Most people are stressed out at these things. They were joyful."
Brad Freeman, the campaign's finance chairman in the state, was so giddy about the outpouring that when he introduced the Governor at a dinner in Los Angeles, he joked that outside, "I was approached by a scalper who offered me a ticket for $3,000" to the dinner. He said of Mr. Bush, "Believe me, there's no one I would rather hang out with."
Melvin Sembler, the national finance chairman of the Republican Party, emphasized that he had to stay impartial in the primary races. But he said Mr. Bush was helped "because he does have a wonderful personality."
Indeed, many donors said in interviews that they were drawn to Mr. Bush by what they described as his impressive political skills in person and on television. At every gathering, Mr. Bush's staff has built in time for him to mingle at each table and try to greet every donor personally.
The events draw donors from all ideological stripes -- from foes of abortion to abortion rights supporters -- and even some Democrats.
"It's about charisma," said Mary Jo Wisely, 54, a donor from Sonoma, Calif., who owns a restaurant franchise. "His father just didn't get it. But his son does. And we have a candidate who can win."
Andrew M. Ling, who is senior vice president of GTX Corporation in Phoenix, said he decided to donate to Mr. Bush because of "his charisma." He said, "One of the driving things that people are searching for is restoration of the dignity of the office of the President."
Yet Mr. Ling, who is 39, also said Mr. Bush came to the race with built-in advantages. "He's very lucky," Mr. Ling said. "He has his father's infrastructure. His contacts in Texas and California are formidable."
Mr. Ling warned that despite Mr. Bush's financial advantage, the honeymoon is bound to end when he begins laying out his positions. "He's got to deliver now," he said.
The intake is so beyond what the Bush campaign had anticipated that the campaign plans to announce later this month that it will not need to take Federal matching funds -- and therefore can raise and spend far more money in the primaries. Initially, Mr. Bush had said he would not make the decision until October or November.
Mr. Bush said he was sliding into a nap on a couch in the dark cabin of a corporate jet at about 1 A.M. on June 25 when Mr. Evans told him the news that would be a turning point for his campaign, not to say a milestone in Presidential politics.
"Donny came back and said, 'I think we can put a three before the number,' " he recalled in the interview. "I was reclining and I just kind of smiled. I just kind of shook my head. Then I sacked out. It was a nice note to go to sleep on: a groundswell of support that I never dreamed would happen."
As the donations continue to pour in, the Governor and Mr. Evans insist that they have not pondered what the final figure might be.
"I have no idea," Mr. Evans said. "That's a number I haven't even dreamed about."

HEADLINE: Newark Hails Baseball's Return, but the High Cost of a New Stadium Raises Doubts

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 3

 BODY:
Groundskeepers painstakingly leveled the clay-orange dirt around home plate this week, and masons grouted between the earth-hued blocks at the entrance to the new Riverfront Park stadium, which is bringing minor league baseball to New Jersey's largest city for the first time in 50 years.
Officials here proudly predict that the sold-out opening game on July 16, between the Newark Bears and the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds, will be the first of many sellouts that will draw thousands to the city and enliven its downtown. They say the park will accelerate Newark's renaissance, which began in 1997 with the opening of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center nearby and will continue with a proposed new stadium for the Nets and the Devils, New Jersey's pro basketball and hockey teams. 
 What could be wrong with this picture?
For one, the 6,000-seat stadium cost $34 million, about 50 percent more than planned. People familiar with the economics of minor league baseball say it is by far the most expensive minor league park in the country, built when minor leagues and their teams are coming and going at a rapid pace. A potential baseball glut, some industry experts say, makes Newark's expensive ball park far from a sure economic bet.
With opening day just two weeks away, city and Essex County officials are discounting warnings of traffic nightmares as they work to pin down contracts to provide several thousand parking spaces, at rates of $3 to $4, near the stadium. Without such agreements, parking rates within four blocks of the stadium could easily surpass the $6 to $7 charged during business hours. That would leave officials hard pressed to keep their promise of an affordable trip to the ball park, where seats cost $6 to $8.
But officials from Mayor Sharpe James to County Executive James W. Treffinger dismiss the gloomy predictions, saying that the parking will be in place and the streets equal to the traffic flow.
They said the cost overruns were largely the fault of local opponents who forced the city to move the stadium from its original site, a landmark park, to a combination of city-owned and private parcels at the northern edge of downtown Newark, off McCarter Highway. This plunged city and county planners into tough negotiations with the owners of the properties, who extracted $7 million for the land.
One million dollars was added to the ball park's cost because about 15 underground oil storage tanks at the new site had to be cleaned up. And the regional boom in construction has made labor more expensive, adding $3 million.
"The cost overruns have been overblown and misinterpreted," said Mayor James, a Democrat, "and they haven't hurt this investment in affordable, family entertainment that will change the image of Newark forever."
Mr. Treffinger, a Republican, said he believed that the investment in the stadium would increase the value of more than 2 million square feet of nearby office space. If the value of those office buildings rises by 20 percent, county studies have shown, tax revenues will increase by $1.2 million a year.
In addition, the city and the county, under a 10-year contract with the Bears, will get 25 percent of the income from advertising and concessions, 75 percent of the price of luxury box seats and $1 from every ticket sold. The publicly run Essex County Improvement Authority, which financed the stadium, will get all the proceeds from the sale of the right to name it. The authority will get 5 percent of the gross revenues after the team's first $4.75 million, and could get as much as 20 percent depending on how much more the team makes.
For Mr. Treffinger, the stadium also solves a political problem. As part of the arrangement to move the stadium to the downtown site, the city allowed construction of a much-needed county jail within city limits. This not only spared Mr. Treffinger the task of putting the jail elsewhere in the county, but it also eliminated the imminent threat of a $300 million fine and penalties from a Federal court ruling requiring a plan to relieve crowding in the county's jails.
"These benefits alone make it worth it to build the stadium for the Bears," Mr. Treffinger said. "But beyond that, when we talked with the New Jersey Nets about their moving from the Meadowlands and building an arena here, the minor league stadium was a crucial part of the attraction for them."
The stadium's cost overruns and the additional burden it places on taxpayers have drawn fire from the editorial pages of the The Star-Ledger, which once supported it. Some elected officials who once backed the stadium have turned critical.
"You don't do a project like this anywhere in the country without recognizing the possibility of additional costs, but not 50 percent additional," said State Senator Ronald L. Rice, a former City Councilman who unsuccessfully challenged Mayor James's re-election effort last year.
For the Bears' owner, the former Yankees catcher Rick Cerone, such complaints are background noise as he climbs into the unfinished sky boxes of the stadium. On clear days he can see the World Trade Center just over the center field fence.
"After 17 years as a player, this was a way to stay in the game," said Mr. Cerone, 45, who grew up in Newark and remembers his late father, Aldo, telling him stories about the Newark Bears and the Newark Eagles of the old Negro Leagues, which shared Newark's 25,000-seat, Ruppert Stadium until 1950. "My father saw me start on this effort before he died three years ago," Mr. Cerone said, "and while they say don't go into business where it is personal, this is personal."
Mr. Cerone said that the early tense days and their uncertainties have given way to fretting about getting the seats installed in time and whether the shimmering Kentucky bluegrass sod will root deeply enough before opening day. He said he was less worried now about the marketing of the team and the stadium, which will draw on 5.4 million people within a 15-mile radius, because he has a waiting list of corporate customers for advertising signs, promotional nights and sky boxes.
Riverfront Park has incorporated some of the city's baseball lore into the design. For example, a bleacher section that Hallmark, a real estate company, has subsidized as seating for youth groups from around the city has been called the "Knothole Gang" after the children who used to peer through the holes drilled in the wooden fence that lined the left field of Ruppert Stadium.
But for all the nostalgia the stadium may evoke, there is no guarantee that it will be an economic home run. Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who specializes in the sports business, said public investments in stadiums, even in well-heeled major league sites, often falter.
For one thing, he said, a stadium winds up taking entertainment dollars that had been going to locally owned bowling alleys, restaurants and movie theaters. Mr. Zimbalist said stadiums also involve maintenance, sanitation and security costs that, along with the debt service, can mean "a negative bottom line year after year."
"But the real risk is the independent minor league, where more of the teams fail than succeed," he said. "Plus there are six other independent minor league teams in New Jersey, some from different leagues, pulling on their market share."
The Bears are part of a boomlet in minor league baseball. They belong to the independent, six-team Atlantic League, one of the current crop of five independent minor leagues nationwide with a total of 48 teams.
Miles Wolf, founder and commissioner of the Northern League, and president of the company that publishes the minor league trade magazine Baseball America, said that major league baseball enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980's with the construction of new stadiums as economic development vehicles for many cities, including Baltimore and Cleveland.
The desire for new-stadium buzz filtered down to the 160 cities that were homes to the minor league farm teams that are affiliated with major league teams. As a result, he said, in the last decade 80 new minor league stadiums have been built around the country.
But Mr. Wolf said that there are more cities interested in minor league baseball than there are major league-affiliated farm teams. Since 1993, he said, 14 leagues have been started with a total of 66 teams. But Mr. Wolf noted that those numbers have been winnowed by mergers and the tough economics of baseball in small cities.
Mr. Wolf said that he hoped Newark's team would not suffer because of the cost of the stadium. "This is far and away the most expensive minor league stadium, major league-affiliated or unaffiliated," he said. "It is too expensive and certainly sets a new standard for a 6,000-seat stadium that shouldn't be more than $19 million, not counting land."
Still, the stadium's backers say its prospects look good. On a recent day, a smiling Mr. Cerone was visited by people seeking autographs and business people seeking to discuss deals. Among them was a group from NorCrown Bank, which has just six branches in Livingston and South Orange. The bank is trying to decide whether the stadium will be the site of its first stand-alone A.T.M.
"We think a lot of people from Essex County will come this way, and from an advertising point of view, a corporate presence here for us will be significant and good advertising," said Monte Ehrenkranz, vice president and branch coordinator. "We just have to decide whether it's worth the investment."

Serb Church Sends Mixed Signal on Milosevic
There seems to be a shift in the Serbian Orthodox Church from the traditional position of defending President Slobodan Milosevic to a stance advocating his removal. Anti-Milosevic politics are expected during services from at least one priest today. But the church continues to send mixed signals about what its priests should do in toppling a President indicted as a war criminal. 1 

British peacekeeping troops shot two Kosovo Albanians dead and severely wounded two others during a wild street celebration marking the Albanians' freedom from Serbian rule. 4

Search for Reasons Why Blacks Lag in School
Taking on one of education's most troublesome issues, schools have begun discussing why the academic achievement of black middle-class and upper-income students lags behind whites of comparable socioeconomic status. More than a dozen middle-class, racially integrated communities have formed a network to find solutions to the disparity. 1

Lashanda Washington is a single mother, swept up in the vast migration off the nation's welfare rolls. And like countless other young urban women, her efforts to build a new life are complicated by family bonds more powerful than many policymakers understand. 1
 
G.O.P. Drive for Presidency
Gov. George W. Bush's $36.3 million campaign chest was built on enthusiastic support from Texans, Republican governors, and the fund-raising network of his father, the former President. But the most important factor may be Republicans' burning desire to regain the Presidency. 13

HEADLINE: Son Is Accused of Killing His Father And 2d Man in Their Hospital Room

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
A 49-year-old man calmly walked into a Brooklyn hospital yesterday with a knife and a hammer in a bag slung over his back, then killed his ailing father by slashing his throat, beat another patient to death with a hammer and seriously wounded his sister before he was subdued by security guards, law enforcement officials said.
The suspect, Joseph Raineri Jr., was charged yesterday with murder and attempted murder, the police said. Mr. Raineri had no known history of mental illness, the police said, and only a minor police record -- nothing that would have presaged the attack at Victory Memorial Hospital in Dyker Heights shortly afternoon. 
 His father, Joseph Raineri Sr., 74, died soon afterward. The other patient in the room, 88-year-old Michael D'ambrose, died about 6:40 P.M. at Lutheran Hospital. The police said that the suspect's sister, Linda Raineri, 46, who was visiting, was in critical condition at Victory last night with gashes to her throat.
Security guards and nurses in the fifth-floor ward heard screams from the victims and quickly broadcast an alert. Arlen Fishler, who was visiting her own father on the third floor, said a frantic voice called over the intercom for security and emergency workers. "Then someone announced that all visitors should go to the main lobby," Ms. Fishler said.
Deputy Chief Thomas Green of the Police Department's Detective Bureau said investigators did not believe there was any argument before the attack that might have alerted hospital security earlier. A hospital administrator who would not give her name refused to comment on security measures at Victory, where, as in many other hospitals, visitors come and go relatively freely.
According to the police, Mr. Raineri calmly walked into the hospital shortly before noon and went to his father's room on the fifth floor.
Linda Raineri was already there with her teen-age daughter, Christina, the police said. The Raineris all lived together in a nearby apartment, on 64th Street in Dyker Heights.
Mr. Raineri apparently said little after reaching the room and seeing his family huddled, the police said. He put down his bag and calmly pulled out a large knife, then grabbed his father and cut his throat, the police said. He then turned the knife on his sister, cutting several gashes in her throat, the police said. He then pulled out a hammer and beat Mr. D'ambrose, the police added.
A law enforcement official said several nurses and security guards were also wounded as they struggled to subdue the suspect as he swung his hammer.
Hospital administrators expressed their sorrow yesterday during a news conference at the hospital, saying they had never before experienced such violence in their building.
"We appreciate how swiftly the nursing and security staff acted in possibly stopping other deaths or injuries," said William Recevuto, the assistant hospital administrator. "This is a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
There is little to indicate a serious problem in the Raineri family before the attacks.
Over the past 10 years, the family lived quietly in their second-floor apartment on 64th Street. Joseph Raineri Sr. was a former farm worker on Long Island who was once employed at a store in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn before retiring because of heart problems, said Czeslaw Zaranek, the building superintendent.
He said Joseph Raineri Jr. drove a taxi cab, and Linda Raineri was unemployed.
According to the police, Joseph Raineri Jr.'s only trouble with the law was more than a decade ago, when he was convicted twice in separate incidents, once for leaving the scene of an accident and once for a misdemeanor assault.
But neighbors said they were struck by his unfriendliness when they greeted him.
"He's a very strange man," Mr. Zaranek said. "He would close his door as soon as I would come by. He would never look anyone in the face.
"He's known me for years. I've done repairs in their house. But he never says hello."
Neighbors recalled his father as just the opposite, a man of smiles who doted on his granddaughter and sometimes walked her to school.
"I just can't believe what happened, because the grandfather was such a nice man," said Irene Bodolato, 65, who lives one floor above the family. "I guess that son just went berserk."
The news of the attack hit hard around Mr. D'ambrose's house on 67th Street, near the Raineris' apartment. Neighbors recalled that Mr. D'ambrose had remained active until the last year or so, when he had fallen into ill health, and had been in and out of the hospital. Until his 85th birthday, Mr. D'ambrose was still able to drive his car and get whatever he needed. As a younger man of 70 or so, he was active in the community, holding parties for the neighborhood children during the summer and urging them to seek his help with homework should they need it.
"He's a good guy, a real good neighbor who always helps out," said Mario Saporano, 20, as he watched Mr. D'ambrose's extended family gather in grief next door. "He and his wife, Dotty, treated us like we were their own kids."

HEADLINE: Schools Scramble To Find More Space;
Bulge From the Baby Boom Emerges in Closets and Trailers

BYLINE: By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
BLAME it, if you like, on Pearl Harbor.
After all, if it were not for World War II, there might never have been the postwar demographic bulge called the baby boom, which has produced a baby boom of its own. 
 Or blame it on the developers, who have bulldozed New Jersey farms and replaced them with tract houses.
Or on the Federal Government, which has raised immigration quotas to levels approaching those of the late 19th century.
Or on older people, who are leaving the towns where they raised their families for gated golf communities and selling their homes to families bursting with children.
You can even blame it on fertility medicine, which has made it possible, even customary, for women to bear children well into their 40's, and which accounts for all those sets of twins -- 59 sets in Montgomery Township alone -- in the schools.
But whomever or whatever you blame it on, this much is clear. Classrooms in New Jersey -- and the rest of the country for that matter -- are filling up. Fast.
How fast, however, is a matter of debate. Although it's clear that the schools that emptied out between the mid-1970's and early 1990's are filling up again, some communities have been hit harder than others. "How do you know when this cycle is going to end?" asks Martin Feitlowitz, a school architect and demographer. "You don't. All you know is who's in the system now. Going out 10 years, you're going out on a limb. You're talking about kids who haven't been born yet."
The good news is that the current baby boom -- called the baby boom echo by demographers -- is not as big as the last one, which caused classrooms to overflow 30 years ago.
The number of schoolchildren in New Jersey peaked at about 1.58 million children in the 1972-73 school year, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. After falling to a low of 1.08 million in 1989-90, it is now 1.27 million and growing. Dr. Hughes thinks New Jersey school enrollment could peak at about 1.4 million around 2002-3, and then hover near that level for years.
This new baby boom is smaller than the first because, while lots of boomers are having children, they are having fewer than their parents did. At the peak of the baby boom, in 1957, the average woman produced 3.7 children, Dr. Hughes said. At the trough of the baby bust, in 1976, the average woman produced 1.7. Currently the birth rate hangs at 2.0 -- undramatic, except that it is two children for each woman in the biggest generation in American history.
And demographers can only guess about the behavior of the baby bust generation, which follows the boomers. Now in their 20's and 30's, baby busters are becoming parents themselves, and their behavior will determine whether the torrent of schoolchildren lets up.
Whatever the future, there's the real fact that schools in New Jersey now have to deal with almost 200,000 more students than a decade ago -- an increase of 18 percent.
The adjustment is not easy. For one thing, the stock of buildings has declined since the first baby boom; many districts sold schools in the late 1970's and early 1980's as their enrollments started to thin. And many of the buildings that remain are vastly out of date and literally crumbling, particularly in urban districts, which are filled with schools built to handle the waves of immigration in the 1910's and 1920's.
Even relatively modern schools -- those built to accommodate the original baby boomers -- are seriously outmoded. Dr. Hughes, who grew up in Elizabeth, remembers being acutely jealous of students in the suburbs. "Those new school buildings, one-story, modern aluminum buildings with pastel panels: they looked like paradise to me," he said. But as a grown-up planner, he sees that they seriously fell short, especially in terms of energy efficiency and adaptability for computers in the classroom.
Building new schools has become a lot more expensive, not just because of inflation or the need for fiber optic cables for computers, but because of state requirements about everything from ventilation to ceiling heights in gyms. Mr. Feitlowitz, who has been designing schools in New Jersey for 30 years, said the typical school of the late 1960's could be built for $25 to $30 a square foot. Today it costs $140 to $150 a square foot.
Everybody agrees that it is going to be expensive to renovate old schools or build new ones -- but nobody agrees on how expensive. The Whitman administration has proposed that $6 billion be spent on school construction statewide -- with $4 billion coming from the state and $2 billion from local districts. "Six billion is admittedly an estimate," said the State Treasurer, James A. D'Eleuterio. "But it's a very, very significant commitment by the state."
The New Jersey School Boards Association, however, is worried that the $6 billion far underestimates the need for school construction. And things are complicated by the fact the state is committed, by court order, to finance 100 percent of the construction needs of the 28 poorest school districts, known as the Abbott districts. Estimates for just rebuilding the Abbotts start at $2.6 billion. Where does that leave the state's remaining 583 districts?
R. Thomas Jannarone, consultant for urban affairs for the New Jersey School Administrators Association, points out that many suburban districts -- squeezed by rising enrollments and voter reluctance to raise taxes -- now face serious financial problems. "The irony," he said, "is that's the same situation the urbans were in 20 years ago."
If it is hard to wrap your mind around populations in the millions, it ismuch easier to look at individual districts, or schools. Here is the statistic local school boards like to use when they're trying to convince voters that the baby boom echo is real: look at the number of graduating seniors (who represent the very tail end of the baby bust), and compare that with the size of the kindergarten classes that are replacing them.
The situation is most dramatic in districts where there has been a lot of new housing construction, like Montgomery Township, north of Princeton, or Evesham, near Cherry Hill. More than 1,700 new dwellings were occupied in Montgomery from 1990 through 1997, according to a report by Sara K. Weissman, a consultant on demographic issues for school districts. So it is hardly surprising that in June 1997, Montgomery graduated 120 seniors and the next September replaced them with 240 kindergartners. The district has spent $45 million on school expansion since 1994, and is going to voters again in December for $60 million more to build a new high school.
But even in mature districts with little room to build new houses, monster kindergarten classes are replacing small senior classes. In Millburn, 189 seniors graduated last year and 331 kindergartners replaced them. Glen Ridge graduated 65 seniors last week, and will have 127 pre-kindergarten children enter the system in September. Statewide, the pattern also holds true. In 1997, there were 66,642 seniors and 92,170 kindergartners. And as the schools digest these big chunks of kids -- think of a rabbit moving through a python -- the overcrowding problem simply moves from elementary schools, into middle schools, and up to the high schools.
The mystery is how there could be such sizable jumps of enrollment in places like Glen Ridge, where there is no new housing construction. Mr. Feitlowitz, who has done studies for Millburn, Glen Ridge and West Orange, offered this answer: "Families with young children moving in with young children, and empty nesters moving out."
"New homes are not the enrollment driver," Mrs. Weissman agreed. "They're just the visible one."
All school lunchrooms are noisy, but the one at Edison Middle School in West Orange sometimes exceeds 80 decibels: noisier than heavy street traffic, quieter than a pneumatic drill. It is loud enough to require the school's assistant principal to stand in front of the room with a microphone to call tables up to the lunch line. By the time all 170 sixth graders move through, there will only be a few minutes left to eat that lunch.
Five years ago, there would have just been 120 students in the cafeteria. Next year, the sixth grade class is expected to top 200, so they will have to eat in two shifts, shortening the lunch "hour" to 20 minutes.
And that is just one sign of overcrowding at this middle-class, racially mixed Essex County school, built in 1928. Small, windowless rooms originally designed as closets now hold students and staff. The school's child study team is housed in the former closet for audio-visual equipment. Eight special education students meet after lunch in another former closet, 12 by 20 feet, where theater costumes were once stored. There is no separate room for the school orchestra, which meets in the cafeteria. The library is also used as classroom several periods a day.
Squeezing a regular classroom into the corner of a library is a standard measure for overcrowded schools. It is done in Montgomery, which was a rural farming community until the early 1990's, "when things began to pop," according to Dr. Jamie Savedoff, the superintendent. The school's population has ballooned to 3,200 students from 1,500 in 1993, and it is projected to reach 6,000 by 2008. "Every space within our schools is being used," Dr. Savedoff said. "Teachers' rooms have been turned into classrooms. Small rooms have been converted into classrooms. Auxiliary rooms, which we used to use for library, are turned into classrooms. We've given up art and music rooms. We've put them on carts."
Dr. Savedoff said class sizes had grown too, running as high as 38 in the high school and 30 in the elementary school, although those respective numbers are now down to 32 and 25 with the recent school expansions. "We've been fortunate in that we haven't had to bring trailers in yet," he said.
But he said trailers might be a possibility if Montgomery's $60 million referendum doesn't pass in December.
"People understand," he said. "It's a very pro-education community. People know that you can't put two quarts of water into a one-quart jar. On the other hand, you get into the emotional discussion of when is it going to stop already?" Dr. Savedoff knows that to win this referendum, he must get out there and really sell. Voters in Montgomery turned down a $14 million bond referendum in April 1998.
In Evesham, a growing suburb near Cherry Hill, trailers have already been brought in. Two went in front of one elementary school; one trailer went in front of another. Superintendent John Bigley said trailers were not put in front, as some people think, to persuade voters to approve more school spending, but because it would have been more costly to run sewer and electric lines for trailers behind the schools.
Still, such a visible sign of overcrowding may have helped the district win a $34 million referendum last December, after two other ballot measures -- for smaller amounts -- failed the previous year. "The reality was that we weren't bluffing," Mr. Bigley said. He credited the victory to a large community task force to study enrollment growth, which involved older citizens and other opponents of the original two referendums.
Jerry Tarnoff, the superintendent in West Orange, has not been as fortunate. He has seen three referendums go down since 1995. "What is a district supposed to do?" he asked.
What a district like West Orange has to do -- and in fact did do -- is find a way around the voters. This summer, it will begin some renovations and additions under a $9 million lease-purchase plan. Lease-purchase is a provision that allows districts to apply to the state to raise money (the costs are still borne by property owners) after referendums are repeatedly defeated. But the $9 million lease-purchase construction program is a far cry from the $55 million the district asked from its voters for in 1995. "It becomes a stopgap measure," Mr. Tarnoff said. "I wouldn't want anybody to think that this is going to be the answer."
The pessimistic Thomas Robert Malthus, who wrote his famous "Essay on the Principle of Population" in 1798, would probably cross his arms in smug satisfaction at the way his theories have played out in 20th-century suburban New Jersey. He postulated that populations spiral out of control until checked by famine, pestilence or war. In the modern version of things, however, overcrowded schools and high property taxes, rather than outright scourges, put a check on growth.
Some argue, however, that -- with appropriate planning -- it does not have to be that way. Richard Gulick is the planning director for the town of Randolph, a former bungalow community in Morris County that began to suburbanize in the 1960's. In the mid-1990's, Randolph adopted a "community impact statement" ordinance, requiring builders to determine how their proposed housing developments would affect schools, roads and other services.
"What communities didn't realize was that residential ratables are not good ratables because of the cost to educate a child," Mr. Gulick said. "The cost of education is a back-breaker."
William Dressel, executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, has been lobbying Trenton to allow communities to assess developers to help pay for the added infrastructure -- including schools -- that new developments require. "We're finding that for every dollar of tax revenues received on a residential development, the municipality has to spend $1.67 for services."
As schools struggle with the population rabbit moving through the python, they are increasingly redefining how schools are organized. Educationally, the K-5 elementary school, the 6-8 middle school and the 9-12 high school is the most popular model, and some say the most developmentally sound.
But Livingston, for example, plans to turn one of its middle schools into a stand-alone sixth grade school. Montgomery plans quite a different school configuration for 2003, if its December referendum passes. It would have five educational levels: a K-1 elementary school, a 2-4 elementary, a 5-6 upper elementary, a 7-8 middle school and a 9-12 high school.
Some wonder if this grade-level engineering may be an untested social experiment with unforeseen consequences. A parent and school board member in a growing Somerset County town, who asked not to be identified because the debate had so divided her town, pointed out that while "grade-level centers" sound like ideal groupings, they also break up continuity in a school. Instead of just 40 to 60 new students entering a school in the fall, as would happen in a typical neighborhood elementary school, a school composed of just two grades might have 200 or more new students each year.
"How could a principal who sees 250 kids come into their school possibly get to know those kids?" she asked. "They're coming in one year, they're exiting the next year. Where is the continuity?"
Mr. Gulick, who emphasized that he was speaking for himself rather than the town of Randolph, is also troubled by the social implications of school overcrowding. After the shooting spree in Littleton, Colo., he began to worry about schools growing so fast that principals simply cannot keep track of all the students "The educational system is a very sensitive area," he said. "From a planning perspective, we've been paying so much attention to our environmental issues in the past 20 years that we've forgotten about our social issues."

What It Looks Like in America

Utica, N.Y., was always a place for people from somewhere else. The Germans, Irish and Poles came over, looking for work and finding it in the mills along the Mohawk River. Today the mills are gone and Utica itself is much poorer, its population fallen to 64,000 from 125,000 since 1960. But the currency of hope is still good here. By welcoming more recent waves of immigrants, many of them refugees of war, Utica has gotten in return the new energy sources so vital to economic and civic life. First it was the Amerasians of Vietnam, then the Russians and, in this decade, about 3,000 Bosnians. The Bosnians in particular "pick up on the American entrepreneurial spirit very quickly," opening businesses and buying rundown homes, said Richard Sessler, director of the Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees. The Op-Ed Page asked some of the Russians and Bosnians to photograph scenes that reflect what America means to them. From churches to mall parking lots, from the freedom of the open road to the security of the neighborhood to an old B-52, these are the scenes that stir the soul on July Fourth.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Serving Up Hearty Meals of Information on Wheels

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL

 BODY:
Charlene A. Patterson, 19, can rattle off a list of attractions in upper Manhattan the way other college students might list their favorite ballplayers: the Yeshiva Museum, the African-American Wax Museum, the Morris-Jumel Mansion, the Studio Museum. But even though she grew up in Harlem, Ms. Patterson had not heard of most of these places until a few weeks ago. "To tell the truth, I've lived here all my life and really didn't know there were this many things in the community," she said.
But anyone stopping by her visitors' cart at Broadway and 165th Street, near the Audubon cultural center, might find her wealth of information staggering. 
 "You'd be surprised how many people don't know what's in their own community," she said. "We try to tell them there's a museum right here 10 blocks away from you, and you don't need to go all the way downtown to experience the arts."
The information cart she tends is one of four that were placed in strategic locations in upper Manhattan last week as part of a new effort to promote tourism and economic development. Sponsored by the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the Union Settlement Association and the Manhattan Borough President's office, the program, called Uptown Ambassadors, involved training and paying 10 college students from Harlem, East Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood to help tourists and residents navigate their neighborhoods.
"Tourism has the potential to have a significant economic impact on upper Manhattan's communities," said Rodney E. Lopez, director of communications for the empowerment zone. "So this initiative is designed to make sure that this important information about the area's historic sites and attractions is available to whomever wants it."
At each of the four carts -- at Audubon, Fifth Avenue and 103d Street, Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and 125th Street, and Dyckman and 200th Streets -- one English- and one Spanish-speaking student at any time provide brochures from cultural institutions, menus for local restaurants, notices about events at bars and clubs and information about historic sites. The students are paid $8 an hour.
Uptown Ambassadors is the start of a larger effortplanned for this fall by the empowerment zone called the Upper Manhattan Visitor Network. The carts, which cost about $16,000 each, were bought by the Manhattan Borough President's office. The entire Uptown Ambassador project cost slightly more than $100,000.
Mirianna Pisano, Union Settlement's program director for Uptown Ambassadors, said about 150 people visited the carts each day since the program began on Tuesday. "People came despite the rain," she said.

In Market After Market, a Summer Rally

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
Records dropped like flies in the hot summer sun last week.
 On Wednesday, investors in Japan pushed the Nikkei 225 index to a new high for the year, bolstered by data that suggested a recovery was under way. 
 In Seoul, a rally on Thursday in response to the Federal Reserve's change in bias on American interest rates spilled over to Friday, as the Korea composite index crossed into record territory.
 Also on Friday, the Hang Seng index reached its highest level since Oct. 9, 1997, and had its biggest one-day gain in three months. Malaysia's composite index reached its highest level since September 1997. The Straits Times index in Singapore hit a record. And the Xetra DAX in Frankfurt closed at a high for this year.
 In the United States, the Dow industrials, at 11,139.24, and the Nasdaq, at 2,741.02, surpassed previous highs, marking the best week for stocks since last October.
 Giddy investors may see the makings of an extended rally. We felt we'd see a summer rally in stocks up to 11,500 on the Dow, so we're more than halfway home, Philip Orlando, chief investment officer for Value Line Asset Management, told Bloomberg News. MICKEY MEECE

Warp Speed
 America in the Age of Mixed Media.
 By Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel.
 193 pp. New York:
 The Century Foundation Press. $24.95. 
 In his preface to "Warp Speed: America in the Age of Mixed Media," David Halberstam asserts that "the past year has been, I think, the worst year for American journalism since I entered the profession 44 years ago." He is speaking, it goes without saying, of the press's coverage of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
This is the subject of "Warp Speed," a book far more focused and provocative than its lofty subtitle might suggest. Bill Kovach, the curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism and a former editor of The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, and Tom Rosenstiel, the director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, use the Lewinsky scandal as a prism to disperse light on the American press. The results are cold-eyed and unsparing. The authors conclude that in the current "mixed-media culture," "a true and reliable account of the day's events" has been undermined and displaced by whatever passes for "continuous news." Power has shifted from reporters to sources whose agendas are often hidden. Argument and opinion, the more strident the better, have supplanted information. And there is a fixation on "the big story" that will deliver a large audience and ratings, with O. J. Simpson as the model.
These conclusions flow from several detailed accounts of specific stories that defined the Lewinsky coverage, starting with the sensational story of the semen-stained blue dress, as good an example as any to illustrate what the mixed-media culture has wrought. It seems fair to say that the public and the news media alike greeted the revelation of the dress with horrified fascination. More than any other single story, it seemed to define the depths to which we had collectively descended as a politically motivated sexual harassment case filed against a reckless President moved from the courts to an independent counsel to Congress.
The existence of a semen-stained dress was first reported on Jan. 21, 1998 (the same day the Lewinsky story broke in The Washington Post), in the Drudge Report, written by Matt Drudge, whom the authors describe as a "professional Internet gossip." Drudge wrote that Linda Tripp had "shared with investigators" the information that Lewinsky had saved a garment with the President's semen on it. It was the Drudge Report that had pushed the Lewinsky story into The Washington Post in the first place, and Drudge embodies much of what Kovach and Rosenstiel lament about the current media culture. Drudge is often wrong but often right; he makes no pretense of filtering information on grounds of taste, relevance or accuracy, and he is fast. A person like Drudge, armed with the technology of the Internet, surely marks a new stage in the democratization of the news media. He is the new gatekeeper.
The next day, Jackie Judd of ABC News reported that Lewinsky had kept a blue dress stained with the President's semen as a "kind of souvenir." Judd based her report on a single anonymous source other than Drudge, who in turn had relied on one or more anonymous sources. Hearsay sources didn't stop many other news organizations. Indeed, 18 percent of the news reports the next day attributed the information solely to another news organization, in this case ABC. Sam Donaldson proclaimed that if Clinton was not telling the truth, "I think his Presidency is numbered in days." Many talk show hosts wallowed gleefully in the unsavory details.
The day after that, Lewinsky's lawyer, William Ginsburg, seemed to deny the story on the record, which brought it fully into the mainstream news media, although this time in the context that it was false. The F.B.I., it was reported, had found no such dress. Speculation abounded that the anonymous source for the blue-dress story, as she was for much of the Lewinsky saga, was Lucianne Goldberg, a confidante of Linda Tripp and avowed critic of President Clinton. The press turned against itself, castigating the decline of standards. As Russell Baker wrote in The New York Times, "Has there ever been a more disgusting media meltdown?" The Committee of Concerned Journalists concluded that the blue-dress story might be a "textbook example of consider the source." Much of the criticism was premised on the notion that the story was wrong.
But it wasn't. It was indisputably relevant and proved to be pivotal evidence in the case against the President. Is it any wonder the blue-dress story left the public angry and confused?
Kovach and Rosenstiel found that contrary to White House claims, "the press usually relied on legitimate sources and often was careful about the facts in the first account," as turned out to be the case with ABC and the dress. The key words here are "first account." For "others then used the reporting from elsewhere to engage in sometimes reckless speculation and propaganda." Predictions that Clinton's days as President were numbered were flatly wrong. So were numerous attacks on ABC for inaccurate reporting.
The increase in opinion, speculation and argument documented by the authors in the American press, especially on television and radio, seems incontrovertible. They rightly note that this kind of programming serves more as entertainment than information and is cheap to produce and disseminate in nearly limitless quantity. News, by contrast, is expensive, especially the kind of investigative reporting called for in the Lewinsky scandal, and in scant supply. This trend seems especially troubling when the lines blur and when the public may be misled, as when Sam Donaldson predicts the President's imminent demise, or the Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff appears on MSNBC as a paid pundit, or George Stephanopoulos suddenly metamorphoses into a television journalist.
The authors conclude that reporters are relying ever more heavily on anonymous sources, and that they are failing to characterize the possible biases of such sources. "The press should be exercising more caution about anonymity today. Instead, it is exhibiting less," they assert. Still, they acknowledge that the issue of anonymous sources is complicated. After all, in the blue-dress episode, the anonymous source turned out to be correct, and Ginsburg, the on-the-record source, was wrong. The cost of relying only on on-the-record sources would be the loss of a tremendous amount of news, much of it far more accurate and important than the pablum delivered in press releases and on-the-record news conferences. The two-source rule championed by The Washington Post in the Watergate era -- or any other hard and fast rule of that nature -- has always struck me as nonsense. Far more important than the number of sources is their identity. At one point The New York Times had four hearsay sources asserting there was a witness to an intimate encounter between Clinton and Lewinsky, but the paper said it killed the article because it wasn't sure of the facts.
At the same time, it is a truism that more sources are always better, and relying on a single source requires a degree of caution that is in scant evidence at many organizations or even, in the case of a Drudge, nonexistent. Exercising judgment is all the more difficult given the speed with which an undifferentiated mix of rumor, gossip, innuendo and fact appears on the Internet, putting pressure on news organizations to respond or risk getting scooped.
While this short book can only touch on the issue, the authors also lament the degree to which journalists have come to be seen as participants in the culture wars rather than neutral and dispassionate observers. They found a consistent pro-prosecution bias in the Lewinsky coverage, a voracious appetite for conflict and scandal and a zeal for policing the sex lives of political candidates that alienated the public. If polls (as opposed to ratings) can be believed, the coverage of the Lewinsky affair was highly unpopular. Two weeks after the story broke, a majority of people surveyed said they thought "the best thing for the nation" would be to "drop the matter."
In "Warp Speed," Kovach and Rosenstiel have written a fascinating deconstruction of specific stories and rendered a public service to journalism. Their solution for the plight they describe is for news organizations to set standards, communicate them to reporters and the editorial staff and then reach a covenant with consumers that those standards will be maintained. A good first step would be for reporters to do their own work rather than recycling others' reports. How likely are these precepts to be followed? Not very. At the upper ranks of the profession, they will no doubt be welcomed. But elsewhere, they fly in the face of the broader economic, social and technological forces the authors so convincingly document.

HEADLINE: Harlem Gallery Is a Child's Haven

BYLINE: By ESTELLA DURAN 

 BODY:
Nine-year-old Kayon Hicks was blissfully skipping rope with a telephone wire on a Harlem sidewalk the other day and giggling with her friends. But when she walked into Gallery M she was in a different world. Here, she said, she feels like a queen among the queens she sees in the art on the walls.
Jazz music played as she twirled a white lace parasol and quietly studied the figures, from strong African women to hopeful little girls like herself. 
 "I love this place," she said. "It has a lot of joy."
Gallery M is opening the door to a wide world of art for Kayon and other neighborhood children who have adopted it as a hangout. The small gallery, at 123 West 135th Street, around the corner from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, showcases works by artists who are or have been homeless as well as by mainstream artists and children.
"I really love to see the kids so excited about art," said the gallery manager, Edie Lynch. "They've been coming in here and doing their homework after school or visiting on the weekends, and I've been helping them draw pictures of their own."
The four-year-old gallery, run by Weston United Community Renewal Inc., was originally founded to exhibit the art made by people in the group's residences for the homeless and in rehabilitation centers. It started including pieces by mainstream artists and even a neighborhood child with its most recent exhibition, which runs through July 15.
The gallery was host to a tea party fund-raiser on Saturday to help buy Kayon a $150 artwork she has been longing for, "Little Girl Looking Out a Heart-Shaped Moon," a shadow box by Jimmie Smith, a professional artist. Kayon and her sister, LaKeshia, 10, have been doing chores like polishing display cases at the gallery to earn money to put the piece up in their bedroom.
"The girls were never really interested in art before, so it's nice to know they're going into the gallery and learning," said Sheila Hicks, their mother.
The mixed-media shadow box is one of a series Mr. Smith made featuring his girlfriend's 10-year-old daughter, Jaycee, looking out a window at fantastic scenes that are in stark contrast to the real view outside her window: a junkyard.
Mr. Smith's works are a hit with the children who visit Gallery M, as are the gallery's baskets of jazz CD's and children's books. Other popular items include watercolor portraits by 10-year-old Danielle West, who lives nearby.
"This little girl just came knocking on our door one rainy day before our exhibit opening," Ms. Lynch said. "And she said: 'Please let me in. I'm an artist.'
"We saw her portraits, and she was good. So we included her in the show."
The children also enjoy works in the gallery like the striking oil paintings of slave women in the series "Endurance of the Spirit Women" by Lloyd Stevens, an art director for The New York Times; portraits of entertainers by James Jenkins, who is living in one of the Weston United residences, and jewelry by Gennady Osmerkin.
Herb Boyd, who took his history of Harlem class from the College of New Rochelle to the studio on a neighborhood tour, said he was happy to witness the children's delight.
Mr. Boyd said that although the gallery is fairly new, the children's interest in it shows it is an asset to the community.
"It's great to see the kids in here, because the kids will grow with the gallery," he said. "They will come to value and understand the importance of art. And when they're older, they will do their best to promote and preserve art."

HEADLINE: The Dominant Position of the Gartner Group

SERIES: COUNTING TO 2000: The Prognosticators

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
How much will the battle to tame Year 2000 computer problems cost? When will computer malfunctions hit? Which countries or industries are furthest along -- or furthest behind -- in dealing with the Year 2000 challenge?
One name comes up repeatedly when such questions are posed: Gartner Group Inc. From Congressional hearings to corporate board rooms, Year 2000 progress reports and risk assessments often begin, and sometimes end, with Gartner's research. The consulting firm's thousands of information-technology clients include not just the business elite but foreign governments ranging from economic powers like Japan to the sorely distressed like Russia and Indonesia. 
 That gives the use of Gartner's Year 2000 projections the same cachet that went with corporate decisions to buy I.B.M. computers in the 1960's, even though many Year 2000 experts say Gartner's research process raises as many questions as it answers.
Gartner's Year 2000 star rose rapidly after a 1996 Congressional hearing when it suggested that American companies might spend as much as $600 billion finding and dealing with end-of-century computer flaws, making it the first prominent information-technology firm to put a hard, eye-opening number on the problem in a public forum. The resulting publicity encouraged the firm, based in Stamford, Conn., to expand its research on the subject; today, its rankings and data permeate Year 2000 print and broadcast reports.
"If I took Ronald McDonald and put a Gartner suit on him, he'd be interviewed by all the big media outlets for Y2K expertise," said William Ulrich, a consultant based in Soquel, Calif., using the popular shorthand for Year 2000 issues.
The most prominent figure in the Gartner suit on a given day is often Louis Marcoccio, the company's director of Year 2000 research. A 52-year-old computer management veteran with an M.B.A., a law degree and teaching credentials to go along with three engineering degrees, Mr. Marcoccio's life is a whirl of speeches at Year 2000 conferences, private consultations with Gartner clients, and interviews.
He talks to scores of journalists each week, often for foreign audiences. One recent week included television broadcasts in Japan and Israel and a radio program in Iceland.
"I've had requests to be in movies, and a Canadian rock group wanted to dub me over one of their songs," Mr. Marcoccio said, smiling with a mixture of amusement and dismay at the idea that Year 2000 mania could bring a conservatively attired consultant such brushes with celebrity.
For all the attention, though, Year 2000 issues are such a small part of Gartner's overall consulting business that it is almost irrelevant to investors, according to analysts who follow the company.
Gartner says the sale of Year 2000 research and advice will bring in less than $8 million of the $750 million in total revenue that Wall Street is projecting this year. The eight full-time Year 2000 analysts represent just 1 percent of the 800 information-technology specialists working for Gartner worldwide. Most clients get the research at bargain rates as an addition to other research services.
Gartner's stock is down 37 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 13 percent climb in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. It has lagged behind the market's rise because of concerns about the growth prospects of the rest of the business and, more recently, about a complicated financial restructuring and stock buyback plan scheduled during the summer.
But however puny from the perspective of the balance sheet, Gartner's Year 2000 effort speaks to giant fears about the inability of some computers, programs and electronic devices to handle dates after Jan. 1, 2000.
Gartner had been advising clients since the late 1980's to get to work on Year 2000 issues, though it was not until 1993 that it tried to analyze the extent of the potential problem.
Company officials said they were startled when the analyst they hired, Kevin Schick, came up with a cost estimate of $300 billion to $600 billion. Mr. Schick, who left Gartner in 1996 and later founded Enterprise Solution Partners, an Internet publisher in Chicago, said he had simply put together Gartner estimates of the lines of computer code in use with data on the average cost of hiring outside programmers to repair faulty mainframe computer software.
It later became apparent that lines of code was too crude a measurement to accurately project a company's Year 2000 costs. In addition, computer users surprised Gartner and most other experts by doing most of their repairs internally instead of hiring outside contractors, which cut their reported costs.
"There's no way spending could get to the upper limits they calculated," said Thomas Oleson, head of Year 2000 research for the International Data Corporation.
Nonetheless, the Gartner estimate has never completely yielded the spotlight that it gained in the 1996 Congressional testimony, in part because its scope was changed. Today it is used as a worldwide figure, not, as Mr. Schick had calculated, the cost for the United States alone, and it includes expenses overlooked in the original estimate, like testing. Later, more cautious projections, like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's recent estimate that the information technology bill in the United States would be less than $86 billion, still attract far less notice.
"When you are first, and you are recognized as a big provider of data, you are going to catch people's attention," said James Woodward, head of the Year 2000 practice for CAP Gemini America in New York, a consulting and software repair firm that has sponsored independent research on Year 2000 programs at big companies.
Gartner's influence also rests in part on its business strategy. Because it is known for selling assessments and visions of where technology is going rather than particular products, many computer users see it as an independent voice with no ax to grind, like Consumer Reports looking at television sets or autos.
Several smaller competitors, like Giga Information, Jupiter and Forrester Research, offer similar independence but lack Gartner's global reach and huge stable of big-name clients. Gartner, which was founded in 1979, has 9,100 corporate and government clients.
But Gartner, like other Year 2000 researchers, relies heavily even today on unverifiable reports by computer users of their plans and progress in dealing with these problems. Ideally, data would come from much more thorough investigation.
"It takes two or three weeks of a consultant's time to find out where a large company really is on Y2K," said Bruce Hall, who was Mr. Marcoccio's predecessor at Gartner and is now vice president at Trigent Software, a company in Southborough, Mass., that uses offshore programmers to help companies do Year 2000 repairs and other software projects.
Still, Gartner's research extends far deeper than the written questionnaires that many others rely on.
The basis for many of its rankings now, according to Mr. Marcoccio, is quarterly polling of 15,000 companies in 31 nations by 11 universities that do the work in exchange for free consulting services. The companies are asked 330 questions in long phone interviews, considered more reliable than written questionnaires.
The results are then cross-checked against a variety of public and private reports and made available to other Gartner analysts for review.
Gartner does not disclose the rankings of individual companies, but private clients can get breakdowns of how different industries are doing, country by country, and in comparison with clusters of clients that the Gartner Group views as leaders.
"Gartner's methodology leaves something to be desired, but it's as good as it gets," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. "At the end of the day, they are the only game in town when it comes to global assessments."
Not really. For global assessments and many other Year 2000 measures, multinational companies and industry groups have recently put together private research efforts that have better or more recent information than Gartner.
Many large banks and other financial institutions, for instance, take part in Global 2000, which has a 22-member committee headed by James Devlin of Citibank that updates country assessments every three weeks.
"We became more positive on Japan and Germany well ahead of Gartner," Mr. Devlin said, citing one difference. But Global 2000, at the request of Government regulators and several key members, keeps most of its research private. Gartner's results are more widely available and are based on more data, Mr. Devlin said.
That makes them subject to disproportionate influence, according to some Year 2000 experts. "At a minimum, if you are a Y2K coordinator in a foreign country, you need to know what Gartner is saying about you," said Bruce McConnell, head of the World Bank's recently formed International Y2K Cooperation Center in Washington and a critic of the weight often given to Gartner Group ratings.
Gartner readily concedes that those it rates have every right to be concerned about how its research -- especially the public summaries of it -- is being used.
"These things are meant to be a flag, not a basis for decisions," Mr. Marcoccio said. He added that Gartner constantly warns clients that a low rating for a country is a signal for them to look more closely at their exposure, not a reason to pull out.

HEADLINE: Nation's Economic Boom A Faint Echo in Appalachia

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, Ky., June 29

 BODY:
"The economic boom?" asked Donna McDonald at her roadside flea market rack of used clothes -- humbly frayed offerings that she has been buying more than selling lately as local customers survive until their welfare checks next week.
Ms. McDonald stared wide-eyed at the question of the boom, as if directions were being sought to some Nirvana far beyond the green highlands and idle coal mines in this hard-core heart of Appalachia. "Not here," she noted of the whirring economy. 
 "Right now a lot of people need extra money and sell me their clothes instead of buying," Ms. McDonald said, explaining the economic cycle as she lives it. "It's tough here; we need jobs and the economy ain't helped," she gently summarized, speaking as the daughter of a coal miner, forced to become one of Appalachia's marginal entrepreneurs.
When President Clinton begins his tour of some of the nation's most entrenched poverty regions on Monday, the entrepreneurial impulse in the eastern hollows of Kentucky will be on his agenda as he makes his first stop in London, Ky., 20 miles to the west down the Daniel Boone Parkway. There he will focus on the bona fide success of Kentucky Highlands, a 31-year-old anti-poverty program whose unusual specialty is the gathering of venture capital via Government loans and charitable foundations to create businesses and jobs in poverty-steeped areas. More than 50 companies and 6,000 jobs have been fostered in nine counties by Kentucky Highlands since Appalachia was first dramatically designated in 1965 as a 13-state swath of intense poverty deserving special regional aid and remedies.
"There's a mystique about Appalachian people: They just don't want to leave this land," L. Ray Moncrief, executive vice president of Kentucky Highlands, said of the poor's tenacity in the tattered coal fields.
As Mr. Clinton arrives, the first President to visit here since Lyndon B. Johnson, the statistical progress measured in the past 34 years by the Appalachian Regional Commission is significant: The poverty rate, once 31 percent, has been halved to 15 percent, just two points higher than the national average. The difference used to be nine points.
"The idea that the Great Society economic development programs didn't work, I think, is just wrong," Jesse L. White Jr., co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission, said of the war on poverty that was begun in the 1960's. President Ronald Reagan crimped the commission's programs, but the regional approach survived and was formally reauthorized by Congress last year after 16 years of uncertain budgeting. Mr. White describes Appalachia's situation as "half-way home and a long way to go."
In the more troubled hamlets, emerald hills resonate as before with the hardscrabble life of residents like Ms. McDonald and her scrawled sign proclaiming "Donna's New and Used Clothes." Appalachia's most resistant areas -- much of West Virginia, southern Ohio and eastern Kentucky -- still have unemployment and poverty rates at least 50 percent higher than the rest of the nation. A checkerboard pattern of diehard neediness in 108 of the region's 406 counties leaves some denizens reacting with a polite shrug to the Clinton visit.
"I guess anybody can go anywhere they want," said Boyd Asher, a whatnot dealer sharing roadside space with Ms. McDonald. "But it seems like his big boom skipped this place," added Mr. Asher, yearning for the steady paycheck of his old coal mining job, lost when the industry moved on.
"That left us down in the dumps," said Mr. Asher, who drives the school bus part-time and hustles used household goods on roads from London to Harlan. "Now the welfare cutbacks in food stamps and all is hurting us bad. The only money around here is during the two weeks after the welfare checks come."
At his side, Matt Collins, retired coal miner and dealer in assorted dishes and novelties, conceded total puzzlement about the economy raging in so many other places. "I just can't never figure it out. Why can't they never get a factory in here?" he said of Clay County, where the unemployment rate is 80 percent worse than the national average. Mr. Clinton, he said, trimmed back traditional welfare on the promise of greater job opportunities.
The President intends to highlight his new venture capital program for impoverished areas. Dubbed New Markets Initiative, it was announced in January as an attempt to use deferred-interest loans and other incentives to draw the private sector more deeply into the Small Business Administration's effort to spawn new business and jobs in distressed areas. Local residents amiably speculate on why this proposal has come more in the twilight than the heyday of the Clinton Administration. But others stand ready to gratefully exploit the occasion.
"It's never too late," said J. C. Egnew, an engineer who quit the space program 27 years ago to settle here and become a businessman, sensing a trainable and loyal pool of factory workers clinging to the land.
With venture capital help from Kentucky Highlands, Mr. Egnew has created five factory businesses and more than 1,000 jobs, producing hunting equipment, military tents and automobile air bags.
"The President is the most powerful man on earth and whatever he decides is important carries a lot of weight," said Mr. Egnew, a community leader in Stearns, Ky., who recently sponsored a new computerized community college center to track the economy globally so the next generation of Highlanders might be better prepared for change.
Asked why one coal-mine hollow inches toward recovery while another does not, Mr. Egnew responded that the dominant factor beyond all the aid programs seemed to be whether a community was willing to dedicate itself to education as the engine of rescue. Otherwise, he said, expectations remain low, political leaders rarely emerge, and innovative ventures are never conceived. Such a community, he said, "leans on those crutches" that date from the worst of Appalachian times in the Depression.
Patty Kidd, a 36-year-old worker in Mr. Egnew's Outdoor Venture business, is a coal miner's daughter who seized a job opportunity as the rarest of Appalachia's resources. "I'm home-grown in this country, and I kind of progressed with the times," she said, describing how she landed a start-up job as a sewing machine operator and worked her way up to supervisor and now plant production manager overseeing all three work shifts. Ever more galvanized, she also obtained a business degree in night school.
"It would be great for the President to get a good picture of our region," said Ms. Kidd, mindful of the luck of the draw in life. "If Mr. Egnew hadn't believed in the people here, what would I be today?"
Ms. Kidd confessed to sadness lately with the high school graduations depositing a fresh crop of teen-agers to hang around with scant promise of a career. "Mr. Clinton's visit couldn't hurt anything around here," she said.

HEADLINE: Federal Seers, Telling Nation's Fiscal Fortune

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Kathy Gramp peered beneath the stacks of paper on her desk and poked through the drawers, an expression of bafflement on her face. Her calculator was at large.
"It's here somewhere," she insisted, rolling her eyes. She seemed to appreciate the strangeness of this particular piece of equipment vanishing, given her job. Ms. Gramp is one of the workers at the Congressional Budget Office who crunch the numbers that tell the country's financial fortune. 
 Then again, Ms. Gramp, who refers to herself as "chatty Kathy" and points to the strands beneath her headband when she mentions "senior, gray-haired analysts," tries not to take her task, or herself, too seriously.
On a wall just outside her office, she and her colleagues have hung various symbols and objects that they jokingly refer to as the real tools of their predictive trade. There is a Ouija board, a crystal ball, a bag of tea leaves, a pair of dice and, incongruously, a plastic replica of a breakfast food.
"A waffle," Ms. Gramp explained. "We waffle."
That is true only to a point. But Ms. Gramp's comic riff underscored a larger reality.
Behind the lofty, quasi-mystical budget numbers that sporadically rise from the nation's capital sit scores of everyday people like Ms. Gramp -- distracted, self-effacing and fully aware of the intrinsic, inevitable flaws in their convoluted guessing game.
That game produced some especially startling results earlier this week. Revising calculations they had made earlier in the year, officials at both the C.B.O. and the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which produces its own set of figures, announced that the Federal surplus over the next 10 years would, in fact, be hundreds of billions of dollars larger than they had previously thought. In fact, the total surplus over that period was projected to be about $2.9 trillion, roughly $1 trillion of which was up for legislative grabs.
These numbers almost instantly altered the political landscape. There were fresh hopes and refined designs for the long-term fiscal survival of Social Security and Medicare. There was new momentum for sweeping tax cuts.
And there were, for the confounded observer, several questions: How did this happen, and who were the instigators?
Ms. Gramp is one, although her piece of the pie is minuscule. One of about 200 people employed by the budget office, she analyzes and projects how much the Federal Government will spend each year on an array of programs related to science, basing her estimates in large part on the spending caps that Congress enacted in 1997 and mathematical formulas that predict when the people who receive Federal grants are likely to actually cash those checks. (Believe it or not, some wait awhile.)
To produce a complete portrait of Federal expenditures in the future, her figure joins comparable estimates from people who specialize in other areas.
"That's Deb -- she does national parks and wetlands and endangered species," Ms. Gramp said one afternoon this week as she navigated a warren of offices on the fourth floor of a building relegated to a distant corner of Capitol Hill: a Congressional Siberia of sorts.
"There's a transportation analyst behind you," Ms. Gramp added as she rounded a corner.
The other half of the puzzle is revenue, also known as taxes, and that is where the indefatigable economy has produced income for the Federal Government that has been exceeding expectations for the last few years.
Rich Kasten works in this area, and he does so somewhat invisibly, which is a judgment not on his influence or personality but on his desktop. Every square millimeter has a leaning tower of paper rising from it, and the shortest tower is at least two feet tall. Only the top of Mr. Kasten's scalp can be seen from the door of his office.
Mr. Kasten has a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but he concedes that his job has as much to do with arithmetic as with abstruse economic theory.
"What you need for this," Mr. Kasten explained, "is a little bit of economic training, a lot of common sense and something like an instinct for numbers, so you can spot new trends."
Much of what Mr. Kasten does -- and what is done by the economic forecasters in the C.B.O. and the O.M.B., who provide the template for him and other players in this process -- is extrapolate from the present into the future, using history as a guide and making informed judgments about changes on the horizon to tweak that model and amend their calculations.
Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, explained: "I might look at what these equations tell me, but I might stare at an equation and say, 'Well, we've never had a stock market like the one we're having now.' I'm going to adjust the results. I'm going to assume that consumption will be a little higher.' That's a judgment. That's where the art comes in."
The further that analysts gaze into the future, the faultier their assumptions are bound to be; they cannot, for starters, anticipate new legislation that may affect the economy, tax revenues and expenditures.
Robert D. Reischauer, another former director of the budget office, said that a 10-year projection "is our best judgment of where we will end up if we remain on automatic pilot."
But, Mr. Reischauer added, "Our whole political system is designed to fly the plane, not to allow it to continue on automatic pilot."
Then, of course, there are the unexpected pockets of turbulence. Lately, they have been happy spasms. For example, in early 1994, the Office of Management and Budget projected a Federal budget deficit for 1998 of $190.5 billion. Instead, the Federal Government had a $69 billion surplus.
What went wrong -- or, rather, right? Joseph J. Minarik, the chief economist for the O.M.B., explained that additional revenue was brought in by an unexpectedly surging economy, dizzying stock market and "the power of compound interest." On top of all that, the Federal Government tightened its spending.
"The future is uncertain," Mr. Minarik said with a smile and a shrug. "I cannot quarrel with that."
Mr. Minarik, who once was a tax analyst for the Congressional Budget Office, has a doctorate in economics from Yale. But economics degrees are not prerequisites for peering into the fiscal future.
Jeff Holland, who interprets the probable impact of economic forecasts on the Federal budget for the C.B.O., has a master's degree in public policy from Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
Much of his job, he said, boils down to numerical calculations, but not the kind that require a supercomputer or other arcane technology. He often works with Lotus software on a Dell computer, and to break the occasional monotony, he plays rock music over the speakers attached to the machine. The stack of compact discs on a cabinet in his office include Aerosmith, Blondie and the Pretenders.
Ms. Gramp is just down the hall, in a section of the budget office noted for its ersatz art gallery. For each and every kind of Federal outlay that the analysts there study, there is a corresponding framed poster of a famous painting or print.
Vincent Van Gogh's "Fishing Boats on the Beach at Saints-Maries-de-la-Mer" represents Federal expenditures on fisheries and water transportation. Georgia O'Keefe's "Cliffs Beyond Abiqui" symbolizes spending on public and Indian lands.
Outlays for national disasters have no visual analogue. "We're still trying to find a good picture of a tsunami," Ms. Gramp said.

HEADLINE: An Alarming Prosecution in Iran

 BODY:
President Mohammad Khatami hopes to strengthen the rule of law in Iran and repair ties with the West. But his efforts are threatened by the dubious espionage charges that clerical prosecutors brought against 13 Iranian Jews. Mr. Khatami, who has been trying to limit his conflicts with conservative clerics before an important parliamentary election, has been cautious in speaking out on this case. But this is a case he cannot condone if he wishes to improve ties with the West.
The arrested Jews are accused of giving military information to Israel and the United States. Until the past few days, they had been held incommunicado. They are still being denied family visits, kosher food and legal representation. Although no trial has yet been held and no incriminating evidence made public, influential Iranian clerics have all but declared the 13 Jews guilty and called for their hanging. 
 Under Iran's Islamic Constitution, the Jewish community is an officially recognized religious minority. Currently, about 25,000 Jews live in Iran, a nation of nearly 70 million people. More than 50,000 Jews have emigrated since the 1979 revolution. Those who remained have had to contend with two decades of government hostility to Israel and several previous espionage prosecutions against Jewish Iranians, although none on this scale. Now there is worry that militant clerics frightened by Mr. Khatami's more tolerant views could strike back against vulnerable Iranian Jews. Mr. Khatami has tried to reassure the Jewish community and has spoken out publicly in defense of the legal rights of its members. But he has not challenged the abusive handling of this case. Outside Iran there have been many expressions of concern. Israel has worked hard to mobilize international attention. The United States has called on Iran to free those arrested, as have Germany, France and the European Union. The Iranians should understand that the persecution of Jews will throw Iran's relations with the West into a new freeze, crippling Iran's attempt to revive its stagnant economy.
Mr. Khatami seems loath to risk accusations of endangering national security by interfering with the prosecution of alleged spies. But so far, this case seems to be less about foreign espionage than about a campaign by Mr. Khatami's domestic enemies to sabotage his program of reform and dialogue with the West. The Iranian people have already paid a high price for the international isolation they have endured for two decades. It would be a pity if Mr. Khatami's reforms were now undermined by a contrived spy case.

HEADLINE: Japanese Thrift

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Reviving the Economics of Fear" (Business Day, July 2), on whether the United States might suffer a Japanese-style liquidity trap in which consumers stop spending, ignores basic differences in history and economic culture between the two countries. 
 For nearly a century, the Japanese Government, schools and women's groups have promoted a "culture of thrift." Housewives keep ledgers, and consumer credit is limited. Heeding official warnings of inadequate social security, families save at high levels (from 12 percent to 23 percent in recent decades). Predictably, the Japanese react to economic uncertainties by severely cutting spending and saving more. It is difficult to imagine free-spending Americans, who now save at negative rates, doing the same.

HEADLINE: Faraway Friends 'Adopt' a Reservation's Elderly

BYLINE: By MINDY SINK 

DATELINE: PINE RIDGE RESERVATION, S.D., July 4

 BODY:
Thaddeus Hust and his wife, Rebecca Thomas, chose their grandfather because they shared an interest in gardening with him.
For the last two years, the couple from Durango, Colo., have been exchanging letters, phone calls and seed packets and helping to support Bernard Little White Man, a 71-year-old widower, through the Adopt-a-Grandparent Program. 
 Today, Mr. Hust spent about two hours grilling sausages at the organization's annual breakfast here, where some of the group's 300 members came to meet the elders they sponsor.
"We always felt this connection, this empathy for the Native Americans," Ms. Thomas said. "Then we heard about this grandparent idea, and it just seemed like such a wonderful way to help the elders."
The Adopt-a-Grandparent Program was started in 1987 by a freelance photojournalist, Gail Russell, who had visited this reservation while on assignment for a magazine. Through friends here she learned of three elderly women who had frozen to death in their homes during a winter storm. It was not clear whether the women could not afford propane for heat or could not make the trip to get supplies.
"We were shocked about the news, and I asked some of the grandmas I knew on the reservation to tell me why the programs they had didn't work," Ms. Russell said. She said she had no plans to start an organization until an elderly friend, Nellie Red Owl, asked her, " 'Wouldn't someone up your way like to adopt a Grandma?' And it just clicked."
Ms. Russell founded the Mountain Light Center, a nonprofit organization that runs the Adopt-a-Grandparent Program. Now she often makes the 12-hour drive from her home in Taos, N.M., to deliver food and other supplies to the reservation. And she organizes a get-together for grandparents and sponsors during the Oglala Sioux's annual powwow.
The Adopt-a-Grandparent Program began with 12 elders from the Wakpamni community here. Now more than 250 elders and their families in Pine Ridge are sponsored, along with about a dozen elders in New Mexico.
Word-of-mouth and a new Web site have helped attract new members, most from the United States, but some from Japan and the Netherlands. Ms. Russell hopes to double the membership this year. The budget for 1998 was $150,000, of which $63,000 went directly to the elders; an additional $75,000 in goods was donated.
"A lot of members say they always wanted to help Native Americans in some way, but there was no structure they were comfortable with," Ms. Russell said.
That was the case for Pete Smith and his girlfriend, Marja-Liisa Bykonich, of Longmont, Colo.
"We see so much outpouring to help others in this country, it goes out to Kosovo or wherever," Mr. Smith said, taking a rest after cooking several bowls of scrambled eggs at this morning's breakfast. "And this is the forgotten part of America, these people that were conquered and just forgotten about."
Members of the program can either pay a membership fee of $50 annually and have no involvement with elders, or they can choose an elder and establish a relationship.
"Some write their adopted grandparent, others send money, some send new blankets or sheets," Ms. Russell said. "There is no prescribed do this or that." In one case, a couple from Washington helped build a house for an adopted grandparent.
The elders are chosen by sponsors from lists provided by Ms. Russell that describe the person's health, hobbies, clothing sizes and other information. To qualify for the program, a person must live on a reservation and be at least 60 years old or handicapped. Members can sponsor more than one elder, and elders can be sponsored by several people.
"I have about three sponsors," said Emily Has No Horse, an 80-year-old widow, who was munching on heart-shaped blue corn waffles that Ms. Russell made this morning. "One woman, Barbara, in California, sends me materials for quilting, or sometimes helps with the electricity bill or pays for propane."
Sitting behind Mrs. Has No Horse was Amelia Yellow Thunder, 70, who showed off the red, green and blue plaid cotton skirt that one of her sponsors had sent her. Both of the women said their only income was about $500 a month from Social Security.
This level of poverty is typical on the Pine Ridge Reservation, which President Clinton was scheduled to visit this week on a tour of disadvantaged regions. About 24,000 of the Oglala Sioux's 38,000 enrolled tribal members live here, including about 15,000 elders, tribal officials say.
Unemployment is about 85 percent here, with a median annual income of $3,400, said Bart Merdanian, a legislative liaison for the tribe. In addition to the financial straits, there is a high incidence of diabetes, heart disease and alcoholism on the reservation, Mr. Merdanian said.
"Our grandmother, Rosemary Good Voice Elk, is diabetic and is in a wheelchair," Ms. Bykonich said. "Her house was hit by the tornado this year, and they lost part of the roof, one bedroom and a front window. I didn't see any beds there when we went by yesterday, but we didn't come right out and ask because they have their pride, too."
Ms. Bykonich said several children and grandchildren also lived with Mrs. Good Voice Elk.
Speaking over the sound of powwow chants and a summer thunderstorm, Ms. Russell said: "The Native American way of life is a circle, and we try to have the energy of the organization in the same way. The sponsors say they are getting so much more than they are giving, so it's like life."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Bush's Right-Hand Man Is a Friend With a Midas Touch

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
BACK in Midland, in the harrowing, exhilarating oil days of rising gushers and falling prices, they all had nicknames: Dennis Grubb was "Wemus," George W. Bush was "Boosto" or "the Bombastic Bushkin," Joe O'Neill was "Spider" and Donald L. Evans was usually "Evvie" or "Donnie."
But sometimes, just to annoy the future politician in the rambunctious Mr. Bush, the friends used to call Mr. Evans by another name: "Governor." Back then, in the 70's and 80's, it was Mr. Evans' earnest, organized demeanor that seemed more suitable for an executive office. 
 "It could just as easily have been Donnie," said Mr. Grubb, then an oilman and now an entertainment promoter, referring to the sense of political destiny now gathering around Mr. Bush, the Governor of Texas. "He could have been any kind of politician or elected official he wanted, just like George. And now I think he'll make a great chief of staff."
It is a little early, of course, to start casting a Bush Cabinet, even if Mr. Evans' perfectly graying temples make him a TV-movie dream of a distinguished White House official. But as the chief fund-raiser of Mr. Bush's Presidential campaign, Mr. Evans announced something last week that impressed the political world like few other achievements: the campaign had raised $36 million in just four months, more than any other candidate had ever collected in the entire primary season.
With money now scrutinized as carefully as opinion polls, this announcement only heightened the sense of inevitability carefully cultivated by Mr. Bush's advisers, and gave the impression that Mr. Evans had wrought some kind of financial miracle. More than once, he has heard it said that Mr. Bush had found his Jim Baker, the close friend and aide of Mr. Bush's father, the former President. This kind of talk brings an exasperated smile to Mr. Evans' face.
"I'm not that," he said. "I'm just the money guy. If anything, it's more appropriate that somebody call me the Bob Mosbacher of the campaign" -- a reference to another wealthy oilman and adept fund-raiser who became President Bush's Commerce Secretary in 1989. (Mr. Evans does not rule out a possible move to Washington in the future.)
To a large extent, of course, Mr. Evans, who will be 53 later this month, is a rather fortunate money guy. He has collected checks from 75,000 of the nation's most prosperous citizens at an economic peak, and on behalf of a charmer with a well-known name who is considered a Republican savior. It is in his nature to minimize his achievement, but in this case, there is some truth to his modesty.
"This is the easiest fund-raising I've ever done in my life," Mr. Evans said in an interview at campaign headquarters in a plush office building down the street from the state capitol, far more comfortable than the usual utilitarian jumble. "Usually political campaigns are a tough sell, and you always worry that someone's going to ask you for something in return. This time, you call someone and they say, 'Oh, I'm so glad you called me. I was wondering how to make a contribution.' "
But it is also clear that Mr. Bush chose his national finance chairman carefully, entrusting his family's extensive network of money raisers to his best friend, a man with a similar background and sensibility. Mr. Evans, chairman of the University of Texas Board of Regents and chief executive of Tom Brown Inc., a Midland oil and gas company, knows almost everyone Mr. Bush knows in Texas, where a third of the treasury was raised. And being the candidate's best friend made it that much easier to set up a network of "Pioneers," who are each raising $100,000, or to call upon governors who have endorsed Mr. Bush to push their state check-writing operations into overdrive.
HIS experience seeking backers for oil ventures had already led Mr. Evans to become the leading fund-raiser for Mr. Bush's campaigns for governor, but their most formative moments together go back to Midland in the 1970's, when both arrived in West Texas simultaneously to partake in what Mr. Evans calls the "entrepreneurial heaven" of the oil business. Mr. Evans had a mechanical engineering degree from the University of Texas and no real background in the field. But his father had worked for Shell Oil in Houston, where Mr. Evans grew up. His wife, Susie, grew up in Midland with Mr. Bush.
He signed up with Tom Brown, a classic independent wildcatter, and spent two months as a roughneck on the company's rigs before moving back to the office and eventually assuming the company's leadership from Mr. Brown. Mr. Evans invested in a few wells with Mr. Bush's firm, and the two became inseparable, riding out the depths of the oil business and regularly shooting baskets and playing golf. Their families were also close, and Mr. Evans said the Bushes were an invaluable source of support after the Evanses' second daughter, who is mentally retarded, was born. Mr. Evans, a Methodist, calls that event one of the greatest things that ever happened to him. (He and his wife later adopted their third child, a boy.)
"It was more than business," he said. "We shared a lot of the same values and beliefs. Both of us were out there at the same age, building our families, pursuing the American dream, both of us believing our highest calling in life is to serve other people, getting involved in United Way, our church, immersing ourselves in the community. Of course, I always knew who the candidate was going to be."
Still, the cadences of his speech reflect his immersion in his friend's world. Instead of "around the country," he says with repeated passion "around this great country of ours." Driven by his fierce friendship, he sees his current calling as a form of public service, with each flurry of $1,000 checks reflecting not political calculation but hope for America.
"Behind every check, there's a willing heart," Mr. Evans said. "To me, it's not a check, it's a person, someone who cares about this great country."

HEADLINE: Nassau's Paradox: Wealthy but Nearly Broke

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., July 3

 BODY:
To an outsider, the fix Nassau County is in might understandably cause bewilderment. The economy here is booming just as loudly as in New York City, its neighbor to the west, with unemployment at 2.8 percent, 25,000 new jobs cropping up every year, and sales tax receipts growing at better than 3 percent annually. Its population of 1.3 million is one of the wealthiest in the nation, with median household income of more than $73,000.
Yet the county government is nearly broke. 
 Last week, Standard & Poor's steeply downgraded the county's debt to just a couple of rating ticks above junk-bond status. Desperate to close a $200 million budget gap without drastically raising property taxes, the County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, has turned to the Democratic-controlled State Assembly for a bailout, in the form of a new tax on real estate sales.
And the new chairman of the Nassau Democratic Party, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, is gleefully putting the screws to Mr. Gulotta, demanding in return that the county let an independent board supervise its finances.
How did it come to this?
"It really is a simple proposition," said Mr. DiNapoli of Great Neck. "They spend more money than they take in."
Since Mr. Gulotta took office in 1987, analysts at the Wall Street rating agencies say, his budgets have routinely resulted in what they call structural deficits: the amount devoted to paying wages, benefits, supply bills and other recurring expenses is not matched by an equal amount in taxes, fees, rents and other predictable sources of yearly income.
Chuck Cutolo, counsel to the Democratic county legislators, who are outnumbered 14 to 5, compared the Nassau Republicans to the Reagan Republicans of the 1980's and the Rockefeller Republicans of the 1960's and 1970's. "What you have in Nassau County are Reagan-Rockefeller Republicans," he said. "They have the aversion to taxes that Reagan had, and the attraction to spending that Rockefeller had."
But it is not the county's considerable spending on parks, roads and other arguably worthwhile projects that draws the most fire these days. Even Mr. Gulotta's fellow Republicans say privately that his biggest weakness has been in negotiating the county's labor contracts -- or in letting negotiations fail, resulting in binding arbitration.
Over and over again, Nassau's police officers have received raises keeping their wages and benefits at or near the top rank among those in departments nationwide. Typically, in April, an arbitrator awarded Nassau's 517 supervisory officers -- ranked from sergeant to captain -- a 24 percent raise over five years, not counting overtime and other add-ons, retroactive to January 1997.
Two weeks earlier, with the county's cumulative deficit swollen to a record $300 million, Mr. Gulotta gave Nassau's 11,000 civil servants raises of 20 percent over five years and new benefits that are expected to raise the county's labor costs by more than $150 million by 2002.
Adding to the county's expenses, critics say, is the notorious penchant for patronage in Nassau, where Alfonse M. D'Amato got his start, where county workers were once pressured to kick back 1 percent of their pay to the G.O.P., and where the Republican chairman, Joseph M. Margiotta, ruled until he was convicted in an insurance kickback scheme.
The county may not have as fat a payroll as it did before the last fiscal crisis, in 1992, prompted more than 2,000 layoffs. Nevertheless, Democrats contend that a carefully wielded knife could easily trim $10 million in salaries for well-connected but overpaid deputy commissioners and unneeded bridge toll collectors. But they say that Nassau is wasting even more in contracts for things like professional services.
The county attorney, for example, employs more than 60 lawyers who are paid a total of $3.4 million, said Legislator Judith A. Jacobs, the minority leader. But civil rights lawsuits, labor talks and other sensitive matters are all routinely farmed out to a few favored law firms that each make hundreds of thousands of dollars more every year, she said.
And a switch to a politically connected health insurance carrier that had promised huge savings instead cost the county nearly $50 million this year.
Finally, draining money out of Nassau's treasury like an open spigot on a water truck is the county's unfathomable tax-assessment system, based on 1938 construction costs and 1964 land values. The Federal Government sued the county last month, saying the system has resulted in higher taxes for black and Hispanic residents than for whites.
Mr. Gulotta, supported by Republican leaders who feared that their middle-class white constituents would have to pay more in taxes, vowed to fight the suit vigorously.
But appeals of tax assessments, known as certioraris, already cost the county more than $100 million a year in refunds, which the county is borrowing to pay. Even the Republican County Comptroller, Frederick E. Parola, said in a memorandum last month that those refunds "are choking the county."
"They've got a debt of $2.5 billion, of which 40 percent is directly attributable to the tax certioraris," said Steven A. Greenberg, a spokesman for the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, who like many others has urged Nassau to change over to a system based on market values.
"They've been borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars for what is essentially an operating expense," Mr. Greenberg said. "And it's not only the taxpayers today but the children, or even the grandchildren of today's taxpayers, who are going to be paying for it."
To make up for a structural deficit, a county executive has few choices: borrow more money, sell off a county asset or receivable for some quick cash, or roll the deficit into the next year's budget. Mr. Gulotta has done all three. Short-term borrowing, for example, has soared 70 percent in the last five years, to more than $400 million. But in recent years, the County Executive's favorite approach appears to have been the nonrecurring revenue item, better known as the one-shot.
So, for example, twice in recent years, Nassau has made deals with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that Standard & Poor's called "tantamount to deficit financing." In the latest, in exchange for $70 million in up-front cash that went toward last year's deficit, the county in April issued $141 million in bonds that the M.T.A. will use to buy new rail cars. The cost to the county, with interest, will be more than $240 million.
Not every one-shot can be completed quickly, however. The sale of a single property in Plainview was budgeted for eight years before an agreement was reached this spring.
For years, the county has been planning to sell its medical center and nursing home, and Mr. Gulotta's budgets have included the anticipated selling price since 1997. That deal -- now worth $10 million less than expected and so laden with strings that Mr. Parola warned that the county could end up losing money -- has still not closed.
There is, of course, another way to eliminate a structural deficit: raise taxes. Last fall, Republicans in the County Legislature actually forced through a modest 3.6 percent to 4.5 percent increase. But if the State Legislature does not approve Mr. Gulotta's proposal for a 1 percent tax on real estate sales, property taxes could rise by much more this fall -- just in time for November, when all 19 county legislative seats and 27 city and town offices will be up for election.
That prospect, in a nutshell, represents the worst fear of Nassau's Republican leadership. From the party chairman, Joseph N. Mondello, on down, officials view general property tax increases, as opposed to other taxes affecting smaller groups, with something akin to terror.
Mr. Gulotta learned that lesson in 1992, when he was pilloried by Mr. Mondello and others after proposing a tax increase of nearly 26 percent to solve the county's last fiscal crisis -- one ultimately solved with a combination of a smaller tax increase, layoffs and a state-approved, deficit-closing bond issue.
For seven straight years afterward, while the rates of other categories of taxes have risen, Mr. Gulotta cut or froze the general property tax rate.
The bond rating agencies may not have appreciated that policy, since spending continued to rise. But Standard & Poor's does not vote. And politically, even Mr. Gulotta's detractors say his strategy has worked beautifully.
"Our legislators, and the Republicans as well -- they'll go to an event, and the person who gets the biggest applause will be Gulotta," said Mr. Cutolo, the Democratic counsel. "I think it's because he never wanted to say 'no' to anybody. He listens to the applause, and he says to himself: 'This is good. Not saying "no" pays.' And he looks at the election returns, and not saying 'no' pays. And he's learned from that: you don't say 'no.' "

HEADLINE: For Queens Immigrant Family, This Fourth Was a First

BYLINE: By DAVID BARSTOW 

 BODY:
Ali and Samra Sabir came to the United States with two suitcases and $2,000. This was 15 months ago. Yesterday, the Sabirs took their first day off together.
They packed a picnic in a plastic bag and wheeled their two children in a borrowed baby stroller to the Unisphere, which hovers like a giant spacecraft over Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. 
 The Sabirs sat facing the United States on the Unisphere globe.
Pakistan, their homeland, was out of sight.
But this was fitting. Like dozens of other immigrant families in the park yesterday, the Sabirs came to celebrate their new home. As with the shiny new Sears credit card in Mr. Sabir's wallet, a Fourth of July picnic represents a simple way to feel connected to this vast land. It is a chance to fit in, to join effortlessly in the annual rites and rhythms of an often bewildering country.
"That's why we came here," Mrs. Sabir, 27, said, smiling and laughing, and a little giddy to at last have a day -- a whole day! -- with her husband of nearly three years.
This being the first time they celebrated the Fourth of July -- Mr. Sabir's boss at the grocery store made him work last year -- some traditions did not come naturally.
Mrs. Sabir wanted to make lasagna. She had heard this was typical American picnic fare for the Fourth of July. But she had never made lasagna before. She asked Pakistani friends for tips.
"I try to know about lasagna," she said. "I think my husband will be very happy. But I cannot do it. It is too much. It takes too long."
So she settled on a mixture of old and new: a chicken and rice recipe from Pakistan, Lay's potato chips from the United States. Their 18-month-old son, Zunnair, wandered with the bag of Lays toward his 5-month-old sister, Rida, who ignored him.
"Why not we should also enjoy the Fourth of July?" asked Mr. Sabir, 28, laying firm claim to a new holiday and a new set of cultural traditions.
Only a few years ago, the thought of living in the United States -- let alone celebrating America's independence -- seemed a remote possibility for the Sabirs. First cousins, the Sabirs had an arranged marriage and a small house in Chak Jhumra, a modest city in the province of Punjab. Mr. Sabir worked as a physician's assistant. Each Aug. 14, they celebrated Freedom Day, marking the birth of Pakistan in 1947. They envisioned a life devoted to family, their Muslim faith and cricket, Mr. Sabir's passion.
And then something unexpected happened.
Defying long odds, they won a special lottery for work visas in the United States. "We think it is a blessing of God," Mrs. Sabir said. "The U.S.A. is strong, and everybody wants to come here."
Without really thinking it through, they sold their belongings, packed their bags, gathered their savings and flew to New York. First they stayed with a friend in Jersey City; then they moved into a tiny studio apartment in Flushing.
Mr. Sabir found work in the Gold Sword, a nearby grocery store. He works seven days a week stocking shelves, working the deli counter, running the cash register.
At first, Mrs. Sabir was nervous about venturing forth. "I did not want to come out," she said. "I was afraid." But with her husband working all the time, she was forced to go out, which is when she realized something.
"I can go alone everywhere without my husband," she said.
By this, she merely means that she feels safe from criminals, something she did not feel in Pakistan. Mrs. Sabir enjoyed the sense of order here, the way people formed lines in stores, the way the nurses seemed so efficient at Flushing Hospital when she gave birth to Rida.
"Here," Mr. Sabir said, "you feel equal. We appreciate every person in this country."
On this Fourth of July -- a day for counting blessings and fitting in -- it was easy to overlook the painful moments, and there have been plenty. First of all, the Sabirs are terribly homesick. Second, the dream of prosperity remains elusive. Mr. Sabir earns about $300 a week; their rent alone is $561 a month. They have barely inched up the economic ladder compared with their living in Pakistan.
Beyond money is the challenge to their values. Devout Muslims, they are offended by the sight of couples kissing in public. Mr. Sabir draws a careful distinction: he wants his family to remain in America and eventually obtain citizenship, but he does not want them to become Americans. He shudders at the thought of his wife wearing sleeveless dresses, or high heels.
He was thinking about these things one afternoon when he took his wife and children to the Statue of Liberty. There, staring up at the torch, then turning out toward the sea, Mr. Sabir felt a strange stirring. It was the feeling of belonging, he said.
"I feel very good," he said. "I had no idea why I was coming to the United States, but when I was there, looking up, I figured it out."
And so Mr. Sabir has charted a course for prosperity. He plans to obtain a license to drive a limousine. He plans to improve his English by engaging anyone he can in conversation.
He says these things with determination, and even on this day of rest, it turns out, he was quietly pursuing his ambitions in the most American of ways -- networking.
After the picnic, Mr. Sabir and his family headed across a field to join the members of the Universal Cricket Club. The club is made up mostly of young, affluent professionals from Bangladesh, men who have been educated in the United States and who glide easily between East and West.
The captain, Mesbah Ahmed, wears a cap from Deutsche Bank, where he said he works as an investment banker. The team manager, Maruf Siddiquee, is an accountant. A year ago, Mr. Siddiquee had noticed Mr. Sabir watching one of their games. Pakistanis are known for their prowess in cricket, and it was considered a huge upset when Bangladesh beat Pakistan last month.
"Every time I'm in a cab and the driver is Pakistani, I ask, "Do you play cricket?' " Mr. Siddiquee said.
So he asked Mr. Sabir, who, as it happened, was captain of his city's cricket team in Pakistan. "The best team of all the city teams," his wife said proudly. After a few trial bowls, Mr. Siddiquee and Mr. Ahmed were suitably impressed with Mr. Sabir. They asked him to join their team for their first match, which was yesterday against Brothers Union.
Mr. Sabir was looking forward to the match -- "I love cricket so much" -- but he also was hoping to make new friends, new connections. Yes, the wives and girlfriends of his teammates were wearing sleeveless dresses and platform shoes. But Mr. Siddiquee and Mr. Ahmed seemed like just the men he would need to know if he ever wanted to make it beyond the grocery store, and even beyond the limousine business.
"Maybe they will help me," Mr. Sabir said, getting ready to take the cricket pitch on his first Fourth of July celebration.

HEADLINE: Administration Calls for Warning Labels on Eggs

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has proposed that warning labels be put on eggs to alert consumers to the possible serious illnesses, including salmonella poisoning, that eggs can cause.
"Eggs are a good source of protein and can be a healthy and economical contribution to a well-balanced diet," Dr. Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said. "However, they need proper handling or they could potentially be the source of food-borne illness." 
 Salmonella is a common source of food poisoning, and many cases have been linked to eggs. The bacteria can cause nausea and diarrhea, symptoms especially dangerous to the very young, the elderly and others with weak immune symptoms.
About 40,000 cases are reported annually, but the actual number is believed to be much higher because many mild cases are not diagnosed.
In 1997, more than 100 Americans died from salmonella food poisoning.
The labels would alert consumers that eggs "may contain harmful bacteria known to cause serious illness" and would advise buyers to keep eggs refrigerated and to cook them thoroughly. The Government will receive comments on the proposal, issued Thursday, from the public for two and a half months before issuing a final decision.
The Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug Administration said that starting Aug. 27, all eggs and egg products must be refrigerated at 45 degrees or below. A plan to be developed by Nov. 1 will aim to improve the safety of shelled eggs and egg products, the agencies said.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, released a report last week that said the Government's oversight of egg safety left Americans vulnerable to outbreaks of salmonella.
The report suggested that egg safety, now handled by four agencies, should be consolidated within a single Federal department.

HEADLINE: Departing Foreign Aid Chief Says Cuts Are Dangerous

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
The departing director of the Government's major foreign aid agency has criticized the Clinton Administration for allowing itself to be "pushed around" by Congress and warned that legislative cuts in foreign aid had created a crisis for the United States.
In interviews, the director, J. Brian Atwood, took advantage of his imminent departure as administrator of the Agency for International Development to offer an unusually harsh assessment of the Administration and Congress, faulting them for an aid budget that he called dangerously inadequate. 
 "We have a crisis," said Mr. Atwood, who steps down on Friday after six years at A.I.D., which oversees most economic and humanitarian aid programs. "There are a lot of people around the world who depend on the United States, and we are just a very uncertain trumpet right now."
Without a larger budget to help struggling nations, he said, "you'll see democracies being defeated and radical leaders coming into office."
"Clearly," Mr. Atwood added, "you could see more countries becoming anarchies in Africa. You certainly could see that as a possibility in Russia."
In the Clinton Administration, the overall budget has declined, from $14.1 billion in 1993, when Mr. Clinton took office, to $13.7 billion this year, a decline that is more dramatic when inflation is factored in. The A.I.D. staff has been cut by one-third in that period, to 7,000.
A bill that the Senate passed on July 1 would reduce the budget by an additional 6 percent next year, to $12.9 billion. The United States spends less on foreign aid as a percentage of its gross national product than any other developed nation.
Mr. Atwood, a former career diplomat who has long been affiliated with the Democratic Party, said the White House and State Department understood the need for a larger aid budget, and he praised Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. But he said the Administration had overall not been willing to put up enough of a fight against the Republican leadership in Congress to restore money cut from the budget.
"We have allowed ourselves to be pushed around too much," he said. "I wish we that we had expended more political capital."
The White House had no comment on Mr. Atwood's remarks.
Mr. Atwood also offered pointed criticism of Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accusing him of "a negative exercise of power" that has hindered American foreign policy.
He also contended that a fringe of conservative lawmakers had taken control of American policy toward the United Nations, resulting in the United States's owing an estimated $1 billion in back dues. Many United Nations critics in Congress, Mr. Atwood said, practice "backdoor isolationism" and "didn't have a passport and bragged about it."
In May, Mr. Atwood withdrew his nomination to become Ambassador to Brazil, saying that it was clear that Mr. Helms would never allow his committee to consider the nomination. The two men had clashed over Mr. Atwood's success in blocking the Senator's plans to merge the Agency for International Development into the State Department.
"'I don't feel any malice toward Jesse Helms," Mr. Atwood said. "I'm a fatalist about things. So I'm not angry in that sense."
But Mr. Atwood said he was speaking critically because "I'm passionately concerned about the direction the world is heading."
"I believe we've become complacent," he said. "And I believe a large part of it is because of a failure of American leadership."
A spokesman for Mr. Helms, Marc Thiessen, had no comment on the criticism. "We wish him well in all his future endeavors," Mr. Thiessen said of Mr. Atwood.
Mr. Atwood said Mr. Helms "exercised negative power, not positive power, and usually that means that he exercises it in the context of the confirmation process."
"What I regret," Mr. Atwood added, "is that the system itself allows a single person to have so much power and that people aren't willing to hold people accountable for what they're doing to the foreign policy of the United States."
Mr. Atwood said it was startling that at a time of historic prosperity here, economic research indicates that the world's poor are actually losing ground. He pointed to statistics that the ratio of rich to poor around the world is 65 to 1, or for every $65 earned in industrial countries, $1 is earned in poor ones.
"Right now we're fat and happy," he said of the United States. "And we're growing very complacent, because we think we hear a lot about the democratic revolutions around the world. But what we don't hear about is this growing gap between rich and poor, and that is a poisonous mix. That is going to create crises in the future."
Mr. Atwood was also critical of the Administration for not having done more to defend the United Nations on Capitol Hill and to fight for the full repayment of the back dues. The Senate has passed a bill to repay $800 million in arrears in exchange for a commitment that the United States will reduce its overall contribution to the regular United Nations budget, from 25 to 20 percent.
"I use the word unconscionable," he said of the Government's treatment of the United Nations, adding that the cuts forced on the United Nations had wreaked serious damage, notably to the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. Mr. Atwood, who oversaw American humanitarian relief efforts in Kosovo, said the High Commissioner's office had provided "very bad leadership" in the early weeks of the crisis, when hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees fled.
"The U.N.H.C.R. was not doing its job in the early days," he said. "They didn't have the resources. They didn't have the people. I say that their management failure was the direct result of our failures in providing them with resources."
A spokeswoman for the High Commissioner, Robyn Groves, acknowledged that "there were major problems in the early days" of the crisis.
"We admit there were weaknesses," Ms. Groves said. "I think that at base you have to look at resources."

HEADLINE: Israeli Cabinet Appointments Seem Aimed at Consolidating Barak's Control

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 5

 BODY:
By appointing loyal old-timers to two key posts in his Cabinet and keeping a third for himself, Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak appeared today to be trying to consolidate his hold on power as he completed his Government.
Most experts here are saying Mr. Barak, 57, a highly decorated former general, is acting very much like a military commander. He is flanking himself with a Foreign Minister and a Finance Minister who are not expected to challenge or overshadow him. 
 While this could lead to a more disciplined, even accomplished Government, some believe that it also could portend an autocratic leadership style for Mr. Barak, who will serve as his own Defense Minister.
"Ehud Barak did not distribute senior portfolios to members of his faction," Sima Kadmon, a political analyst, said in the daily Yediot Ahronot today. "He cloned himself for all the major roles."
On the other hand, Mr. Barak made appointments to key social ministries -- Justice, Education and Interior -- that signal a clean break with the past. They also hold a promise of democratic-minded reform in institutions that deal with touchy issues, like the religious-secular power struggle, the question of who is Jew and the future Constitution.
Mr. Barak, after completing his ministerial appointments today, is expected to be sworn in with his Cabinet on Tuesday.
 President Clinton, who was traveling in Kentucky on Monday, briefly interrupted a tour of an electronics factory to speak to Mr. Barak on the phone for about 12 minutes, a White House spokesman said. But they did not set a date for Mr. Barak to visit Washington.
Mr. Barak faced his first defeat today, a frustration to his efforts to shore up his control. His party, One Israel, voted down his choice for the powerful role of Speaker of Parliament -- an inexperienced politician, Shalom Simchon, who one expert said was being set up to serve as Mr. Barak's "suicidal Shiite soldier on the Parliament podium."
Instead, the party -- a reconstituted version of the old Labor -- selected an ambitious Labor Party veteran, Avraham Burg, who is unlikely to be malleable. Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist, said that while it is too early to gauge how Mr. Barak will conduct himself, the Cabinet appointments are telling.
"Look at the Cabinet as Barak's business card," he said. "It tells us two things. First, that he takes very seriously his role as leader of change. And second, in the ministries in which he wants to have direct influence, that he has a strong tendency to surround himself with people who are so loyal that they will not get in his way."
Mr. Barak today appointed Avraham Shochat, 63, of his own One Israel Party to be Finance Minister for the second time, disappointing much of the business sector.
David Levy, 61, was appointed Foreign Minister for the third time on Sunday, leaving professional diplomats somewhat indifferent.
Both men are considered somewhat outmoded in their fields, and neither is considered likely to forge bold initiatives without explicit direction from above.
When news of Mr. Shochat's appointment leaked out Sunday, the Tel Aviv stock exchange immediately dipped downward.
This was a sign that many investors fear his reputation as a policy maker who would prefer to stimulate the economy with Government spending that would expand the deficit, rather than to continue the departing Government's increasingly successful battle against inflation.
His admirers, however, saw as positives the rapid growth rates and surging foreign investments that characterized his previous term. And Mr. Shochat, in brief comments today, indicated that he might pick up where he left off.
"I'd like to reassure the business community," Mr. Shochat said today, "that we're going to pursue a very responsible policy that will be good for the economy, a policy of growth."
Also today, Mr. Barak appointed Yossi Beilin, a leftist political scientist and one of the most independent thinkers in his party, to be Justice Minister. A high-minded champion of civic culture, Mr. Beilin will take over a Justice Ministry that was considered tainted by the departing minister, Tsahi Hanegbi, who has been under investigation for corruption.
It also gives Mr. Beilin, who has worked hard to build a relationship with the ultra-Orthodox, a key role in managing relations between the judiciary and the religious sector. And he will have a strong hand in shaping the evolving Constitution -- a very sensitive issue for the Orthodox.
In another appointment of a progressive, Mr. Barak previously appointed Yossi Sarid, leader of the leftist Meretz Party, to take over the Education Ministry from the religious party that has been in control.
He also took the Interior Ministry, which handles delicate issues involving citizenship and Jewish identity, from the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party and gave it to Natan Sharansky, the Russian immigrant leader.
Mr. Barak today appointed Shlomo Ben-Ami, an intellectual who was the top vote-getter in the party's internal primaries, to be Internal Security Minister, in charge of the police. Mr. Ben-Ami is not a law enforcement specialist; his strengths are foreign and social policies.
Some perceived this as an insult, but others believed that Mr. Ben-Ami could make needed reforms in the police culture while expanding his domain to include social issues like relations between Israeli Arabs and Jews.
Shas will control the Religious Affairs, Health, Labor and Welfare and Infrastructure Ministries. The settlers' party, the National Religious Party, will run the Housing Ministry.
Mr. Barak is facing severe criticism from women's groups. Although he pledged to include more women in his Government than any previous leader, he ended up appointing only one -- Dalia Itzkik of One Israel, who will be Environment Minister.
And he appointed no Arab politicians as ministers or deputy ministers, although Israeli Arab voters, a crucial bloc, supported him nearly unanimously.
Mr. Barak intends to expand his Cabinet of 18 members to 24 members after taking office, so it is possible he will include more women or an Arab at that time.
Over all, it seems likely that he has interpreted his resounding election victory as a personal rather than a party mandate, and that he is constructing a system that allows him maximum control.

HEADLINE: Rising Lake Slowly Stalks a North Dakota Town

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: DEVIL'S LAKE, N.D.

 BODY:
Jim Yri, a tall, sunburned farmer with movie star looks and the folksy style of Jimmy Stewart, has battled North Dakota blizzards and wheat fungus and, lately, appallingly low crop prices. But now he is in a struggle with a lake that he is afraid he just might lose.
The lake, the namesake for this little town, began rising seven years ago when it was just a sliver on the horizon beyond Mr. Yri's white clapboard farmhouse west of here. 
 At first, he shrugged it off as no more than the natural consequence of especially heavy snowfall and rain. But each year the lake has climbed higher, and now the water is in his yard, creeping toward his basement, like some incredible science-fiction monster, threatening to drive him off the land.
"You plow a field and come back a week later and the water has taken the field," Mr. Yri (pronounced Erie) said the other day.
He and thousands of other people around Devil's Lake on the rolling prairie of northeastern North Dakota are caught up in a strange, gradual flood like nothing modern America has ever seen.
Inch by inch, the lake has been swelling across a gently sloping basin without an outlet, forcing nearly 400 families to move their homes as it swallowed up 80,000 acres of farmland, three state parks, miles of country roads and perhaps a million trees. Devil's Lake has tripled in size and now sprawls over nearly 200 square miles, making it more than eight times the size of Manhattan.
Unlike river floods that crush towns in a flash, the destruction at Devil's Lake has come one or two houses at a time, acre by acre, utility pole by utility pole, never with a single surge stunning enough to make the national news.
"I don't think people realize the severity of what's happening here," said Tom LaMotte, the owner of several businesses in Devil's Lake, a town of 10,000 people that is still above water because the rising lake is being held back by a man-built wall of rock and earth.
Devil's Lake and the Great Salt Lake in Utah are among a very few lakes without natural drainage. Their waters rise and fall depending on rain and snow and the saturation of surrounding lands, scientists say, and North Dakota has been in a prolonged wet cycle. The Great Salt Lake flooded in the mid-1980's with less damage than is now being experienced at Devil's Lake, officials say, and while the Salt Lake has risen over the last three years, it has caused little harm.
The slow-motion destruction by Devil's Lake, coupled with gnawing uncertainty about what the lake will do next -- level off and create a booming resort area or keep rising and destroying -- is straining the economy and people's nerves. If being forced to leave were inevitable, many people would leave now. But no one really wants to go. Most of them have been here all their lives.
They like the quiet beauty of the lake, the vermilion explosions at sunset and the serenity of communities where homes and cars are seldom locked. A good many people recognize that if the lake ever does settle down, their property values are likely to skyrocket because of the resort possibilities. Still, nearly everyone would have been happier if the lake had just remained a nice place to visit on a Sunday afternoon.
Federal and state agencies have poured more than $300 million into temporary measures: building dikes, keeping roads open and moving homes out of harm's way. And in early June, President Clinton authorized spending tens of millions for more of the same. But people are beginning to grumble that the money has been wasted.
"Instead of building up the roads a little more every year, they should be finding some permanent solution," said Jarvis Haugeberg, who runs the grain elevator on a shrinking peninsula in Church's Ferry, 20 miles to the northwest. "But they just keep making new studies and arguing about what to do."
Mayor Fred Bott of Devil's Lake, along with just about everyone else around here, argues for hacking an opening in one side of the lake so it can be drained to a tolerable level, into the Sheyenne River. But environmental groups and people in several North Dakota towns worry that any significant drainage could bring flooding elsewhere. Canadians also oppose the drainage, because the Sheyenne runs into the Red River, which flows into their country.
The Army Corps of Engineers agreed in early June that an outlet should be built. But the corps proposed waiting until Devil's Lake had risen seven additional feet, something the engineers think could take until 2006 but many residents fear could happen much more quickly.
North Dakota officials could hardly believe their ears. Gov. Edward T. Schafer and the state's three members of Congress said that letting the lake rise that much higher would inundate 75,000 acres more and could cost up to $200 million more for dikes and roads. So the debate continues. And so does the uncertainty.
"It's always eating at you," Mr. Yri said as he and his wife, Diane, talked in their kitchen. "There's a lot of mental depression around here. You just don't feel like doing anything. Why bother? Next week it will be under water."
At her small, white-shingled home in Minnewaukan, at the edge of the lake, 20 miles west of here, Elizabeth Stensby, a 72-year-old widow, says she keeps asking herself, "Can I stay or do I have to leave?" Her house, where she raised six children, was eight miles from the lake when the water started rising. Now the water is edging into her back yard.
A golf course just across the highway is under water and the town has trucked in sand to make a beach. A few blocks away, the lake is advancing on the high school football field and the main classroom building. Allan Nord, a carpenter who lives nearby, is talking about opening a bait shop.
Since 1993, Devil's Lake has risen nearly 25 feet, to a level higher than it has been in more than 100 years, scientists said. The wall of clay and rocks holding it back from the town, built mainly in the last three years, is seven miles long. Without the wall, most of the town's small, brown-brick business district and its wide, tree-shaded streets and modest homes would be roof-deep in water, said State Senator Vern Thompson. Yet for many people, the dike is as unnerving as it is protective.
"Like anything that was constructed as quickly as the dike, you wonder, 'Is it really secure?' " said Paul Keating, the owner of the local Radio Shack franchise. "It's holding back 30 miles of water, 25 feet deep. The big dams and reservoirs are concrete. This is just dirt. If we get a major thunderstorm, how much lightening can it take? What would a tornado do to it?"
The Red Cross has been giving classes in what to do in a flood emergency. Its evacuation plan links everyone's address to the nearest landmark to help rescue teams find them. Tammy Rutten, who manages a water-tower-painting business with her husband, Tim, says she always drives with her windows rolled down so that she can "bail out" in case her car goes into the water. And Mrs. Yri has enrolled her children in swimming classes.
Mr. Keating, at Radio Shack, like many owners of small businesses in Devil's Lake, is barely surviving. For some merchants, sales are down at least 25 percent this year. Investors are holding back on starting new projects.
For people as far as 50 miles away, going shopping in Devil's Lake used to mean a pleasant drive through fields of wheat and barley and sunflowers. But those roads that have not disappeared have become scary causeways with waves chewing at their edges. Heavy trucks loaded with rock and clay thunder along from dawn to dusk, and construction detours often turn a 20-minute trip into an ordeal of an hour or more.
But not everyone is suffering. Contractors working on the dikes and roads and moving endangered houses are doing very well. They, in turn, are making the cash registers ring for other businesses, with their workers buying fuel, staying in motels and recreational vehicle parks and eating in restaurants. Fishing and duck hunting have never been better, so tourism is up. Rooms that often languished at the Woodland Resort are booked solid. One farmer has converted his flooded land into a fishing camp, and the Sioux Indians at the Spirit Lake Nation on the southern shore are building a nearly 200-slip marina just behind their gambling casino.
No one here wants to seem ungrateful for the Government help Devil's Lake has received, but many people say they cannot help thinking that if it was not such a small community, if it was not in the middle of nowhere and if it could muster a bit more political clout, the lake problem would somehow have been solved by now.
"The bus being hit by a train doesn't have enough passengers," said Rick LaFleur, who runs a family business that distributes jukeboxes and pinball machines.
Mr. Yri has begun to wonder whether he can keep working the land the way his father did. He has sold off the last of his 50 beef cattle because the water has taken their grazing land, and he is talking about moving his house to higher ground. But he worries that the water will eventually take the main roads and put him out of business.
"Without the roads, we're an island," Mr. Yri said. "People felt the lake couldn't keep rising, but it just keeps coming."

Devil's Lake has risen 25 feet since the end of 1992, and is now up to 50 feet deep and covers nearly 200 square miles. The lake can get another 12 to 15 feet deeper before it would begin to naturally flow out, but it would also double in size, covering 400 square miles.

Japan's Executives Say Business Mood Improves
The Japanese central bank's quarterly assessment of business sentiment showed that the perception of business conditions among more than 9,000 executives who responded in June was still negative, but improving. But the survey's so-called diffusion index remained solidly negative, meaning that pessimistic executives still widely outnumbered optimists.
The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks rose 1.13 percent, to 18,135.06 -- its highest close in 21 months. Page C4. 

Right Address, Return to Sender
A new regulation from the United States Postal Service that requires holders of private mail boxes to include the prefix PMB in their address has prompted a flurry of indignant letters to Congress. The regulations also require box holders to submit their home addresses to the post office. Around two million Americans rent boxes at 10,000 stores such as Pakmail and Mail Boxes Etc., often to lend their business addresses prestige, sometimes because they have no fixed address. Store owners and mailbox renters say the new rules invade their privacy and pose a financial threat to their businesses. C2.
 
N.T.T. Plans Global Effort
Junichiro Miyazu, the head of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, intends to use a new law to transform Japan's telecommunications giant into a global player to battle with the likes of AT&T. The new law, which took effect July 1 after a decade of dithering in Japan's Parliament, reshapes N.T.T. and permits it for the first time to compete directly in overseas markets. C4.

HEADLINE: Conflict in Kashmir Stirs Fund-Raising Fervor Among Indian Immigrants

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
For years, earthquakes, floods and other natural calamities back home have kindled patriotic sentiments among immigrants in this country, compelling them to open their checkbooks in the spirit of good will. Now, in a moment of unprecedented nationalist fervor, Indian immigrants in New York City and across the United States are sending home dollars to aid Indian Army soldiers involved in the conflict in Kashmir, the contested mountainous terrain on the India-Pakistan border.
Over the last several weeks, Indian immigrants have been lobbying members of the United States Congress, writing letters to the editors of American newspapers and, most notably, writing checks and transmitting thousands of dollars over the Internet to organizations apparently set up to aid Indian soldiers and their families. Appeals abound on such Web sites and in Indian-American newspapers for donations to the "brave" or "martyred" "jawans" -- foot soldiers in Hindi -- who have been killed or injured in battle on the icy mountaintops of Kashmir. 
 "It's amazing what the response is," said Yash Paul Soi, an engineer for New York City's Environmental Protection Department who is the president of the Federation of Indian Associations, a coalition of dozens of regional Indian organizations. The coalition established a fund three weeks ago to collect contributions for Indian soldiers and their families.
"Our roots are there," he said. "We are very proud to be Indian-Americans of course, but those are our roots."
Because of the variety of fund-raising, it is impossible to tell the total amount donated so far.
As of July 1, the Indian Army's Central Welfare Fund had collected more than $23,300, according to the Army Web site.
The Indian Embassy in Washington has been receiving checks in the mail -- about $10,000 in the last three weeks, said its spokesman, Navtej Sarna. It has turned over the funds to the Prime Minister's Defense Fund, the Government body that receives donations during times of national crises. But it is likely, Mr. Sarna said, that Indians in this country have sent much more directly to the Indian Government and charities. Various other groups have each collected tens of thousands of dollars.
Mr. Sarna said the money being raised has far outweighed fund-raising for natural calamities back home in the past.
"This has been much more than anything in recent years," Mr. Sarna said. "It's not comparable to any natural disaster. This is an external threat and perceived as such. That's why the response is that much more nationalistic."
Details on Pakistani-American fund-raising efforts were not immediately available.
The latest confrontation in Kashmir began more than two months ago, when Muslim guerrillas crossed into the Indian-held part of the state. India has accused Pakistan of sponsoring the insurgents, while Pakistan says they are independent operators seeking the Kashmiris' right to self-determination. Kashmir is India's only state with a Muslim majority, and it has been the focus of three wars between India, a secular but Hindu-majority country, and Pakistan, an Islamic nation, since the partitioning of the subcontinent in 1947.
The drumbeat for dollars for Indian soldiers and their families signals a kind of nationalism that has long been a constant fixture in immigrant communities nationwide. The difference perhaps is the extent to which technology has aided the ability of immigrants today to divert precious dollars to various causes back home.
In this case, several Web sites offer instructions on how to contribute. The Icici Bank, an Indian financial institution, has set up an account at a Manhattan bank, the First Union Bank International, where people can deposit checks.
The American arm of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist political party, has sent E-mail to its supporters, urging them to contribute to the India Development and Relief Fund, a Maryland-based charity associated with Hindu nationalist groups in India, so that they can write it off on their taxes. The group is hoping to raise $50,000.
So far, the India Development and Relief Fund has raised about $25,000, said its president, Vinod Prakash. Mr. Prakash, a retired World Bank economist who has lived in this country for 35 years, said he hoped to double the amount that he had collected so far.
"It's emotionally very charged," he said.

HEADLINE: The Handwriting On the Post-It Note;
Image and Returns Suffer at 3M

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL

 BODY:
Here at the technology center of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Corporation, scientists are tinkering with stickier adhesives, longer-lasting abrasives, glare-free reflective signs -- indeed, with improvements on virtually every product, from the esoteric to the mundane, that 3M makes.
The road to product nirvana, the scientists say, is a hot new technology called microreplication, a way to place thousands of identical microscopic shapes on the surfaces of all kinds of materials, from sandpaper to flat-panel computer screens. 
"Microreplication is reinventing our core businesses," said Robert S. Finocchiaro, a 3M technical director, who runs the microreplication project.
But the mood is a bit more somber across the street, where the corporate types are. Try as they will, they cannot shake Wall Street's perception of 3M as a boring, low-technology drone whose glory days ended with Scotch tape and Post-it notes.
"You put it next to a machinery company, and the stock performance looks the same," said B. Alexander Henderson, who follows 3M for Prudential Securities Research.
The problem is not just image, though; it is performance. For two years, 3M has consistently missed earnings estimates, and its revenues, half of them from foreign shores, have been stuck at $15 billion. Its shares, which sold near $100 in July 1997, drifted to $70 by April. The stock has rebounded some, closing at $88.875 on Friday, but many 3M watchers say the rise comes from investor disaffection with Internet stocks and hopes for an Asian economic recovery, not from confidence in 3M's management.
"They just don't have the killer instinct when it comes to financial returns," said Jack L. Kelly, who follows 3M for Goldman, Sachs.
Is 3M, once a darling of Wall Street, now just another badly managed also-ran? Or is it still a new-product machine that had a bad case of the hiccups last year?
Critics of the company have accused Livio D. DeSimone, 3M's chairman since 1991, of everything from losing 3M's innovative touch to refusing to cut costs to mismanaging inventories to sticking with humdrum products too long. Some have even put pressure on the board to ask Mr. DeSimone, who turns 63 this month, to step down before the mandatory retirement age of 65.
"He knows an incredible amount about product, but he just doesn't have a good enough grip on daily operations," one analyst said.
Mr. DeSimone -- widely known as Desi, a variation on the start of his last name -- tries to take the criticism in stride, but it clearly annoys him. He says he is cutting costs, tightening procedures and getting products to markets faster.
Although Mr. DeSimone, a chemical engineer who has been with 3M for 32 years, acknowledges that maybe he should have bitten those bullets sooner, he maintains that more of 3M's fiscal woes can be traced to the strong dollar and the weak Asian economies than to his mistakes.
"I became dumb all of a sudden in 1998," he said. "Well, no one thought I was dumb in 1997, and hopefully, I'll be seen as smart again in 1999."
Investors are not so easily persuaded. "The U.S. still accounts for half of revenues, too, and the economy here isn't bad," said one portfolio manager.
And Mr. Kelly of Goldman, Sachs said, "Too often, they try to sweep everything under the convenient rug of currency problems."
The company does have fans. Perkin-Elmer, the life-sciences concern now known as the PE Corporation, chose 3M in February as a joint venture partner for genetic analysis. Robert Sprague, a manager at the Xerox Corporation, cites 3M's extensive manufacturing experience as the reason Xerox recently picked 3M to manufacture its "electronic paper" -- reusable rubbery sheets embedded with billions of tiny electrically charged balls that can be written on with an electronic wand.
And even though he feels the stock is fully valued, Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said of 3M, "They have a knack for taking something that exists, changing it a bit and leveraging it into an entirely new product."
Actually, trying to categorize 3M at all is an exercise in frustration.
Founded in 1902 to mine corundum, an abrasive mineral, the company quickly shifted to processing the leftover grit into sandpaper and grinding wheels. Over the years it branched out into industries as unrelated as thermofaxing, the copying method that preceded xerography, and adhesives. It has pulled out of many businesses, including copiers and a bank it once owned, but it still makes 50,000 products, ranging from optical fibers to wound dressings.
Still, 3M is not a classic conglomerate, one that could easily be broken up. Its 40 divisions are as technologically intertwined as an arterial network. "People who ask how dressings mesh with adhesives don't realize that both are sticky," Mr. DeSimone said.
Dow Jones lists 3M under diversified technology, while the Value Line Investment newsletter groups it with diversified chemicals. And Jeffrey J. Zekauskas, a chemical analyst with Schroder & Company, said, "3M technologies, especially in electronics, are relevant to the analysis of specialty chemical companies." Still, neither he nor any other chemical analyst covers 3M.
Instead, it is watched by the same people who track Xerox, Eastman Kodak and other image and document processing companies -- a business 3M left when it spun off Imation a few years ago.
Mr. DeSimone would like 3M, which pumps 6 percent of revenues into research -- higher than most industrial companies -- to be described an innovator, pure and simple. "We're a specialty materials company that takes related technologies into seemingly unrelated end-products," he said.
Microreplication may be the premier example. It involves placing identical three-dimensional structures on a surface, changing how that surface reflects light, wears down or otherwise acts differently from the undoctored version.
For example, old-style abrasive belts for metalworking must be replaced as soon as the abrasive surface is worn away. 3M now uses microreplication to pile cutting surfaces on top of one another, so that when the top surface is worn down, a fresh cutting surface emerges. The company says its new belts, sold under the name Trizact, last up to five times as long as older products.
Innovation is how 3M has made its name. It was here that Post-it notes were born when one employee, frustrated at losing the strips he used to mark text in his church hymnal, enlisted the aid of another, who was trying to develop a seemingly oxymoronic product, a nonbinding adhesive.
Innovation has not been limited to products. 3M was one of the first companies to install a dual-career ladder, a now-popular method for promoting researchers without forcing them out of their labs into management. (Some 3M scientists complain they are still paid less than their management counterparts; 3M says the complaints are baseless.)
Researchers are allowed to devote 15 percent of their time to projects that pique their interest, even those on which management has pulled the plug. That has caused some analysts to criticize 3M for undisciplined management, but Mr. DeSimone defends the practice.
"If you want to encourage innovation, you have to close your eyes when people are so excited about a project that they refuse to stop," he said, noting that Thinsulate, a big-selling clothing insulation material, resulted from a project he had officially scuttled.
When researchers do come up with something promising, they are encouraged to shop it around to all the businesses. A pharmaceuticals researcher invented a dosage dispenser that mixes two drugs together; the adhesives division adapted it to mix pastes that dry as they are applied. A non-heat-generating lighting system developed at a 3M lab in Japan, primarily for use in supermarket coolers, is selling well for architectural lighting in Italy.
The technology swapping is not by happenstance. Researchers hold an annual event, patterned on a trade show but open only to 3M people, where they run booths displaying their latest inventions.
The automotive division picked up a new way to make headlights when some adhesive researchers displayed a multilayer film. "Many of the 'Eurekas!' at 3M come from this forum," said William E. Coyne, senior vice president for research.
By some measurements, 3M's innovation formula has been wildly successful. The company received 611 patents last year, the 11th most of any American company. Management has long insisted that 3M derive one-third of revenues from products that are no more than four years old, and 10 percent from products that are new each year.
Still, innovation could not protect 3M's financial results last year. Its revenues dipped to $15.02 billion from $15.07 billion in 1997. Operating income fared even worse, dropping to $2.04 billion from $2.68 billion. And net income and per-share earnings were practically halved -- $1.18 billion, or 2.88 a diluted share, in 1998, down from $2.12 billion, or $5.06 a share, in 1997.
"When the dollar is strengthening against every currency, geographic diversity is a burden as well as a strength," said Ronald O. Baukol, 3M's executive vice president in charge of international operations.
Mr. DeSimone has tried hard to shore up the numbers. Last year -- much too late, some analysts say -- he promised to cut 4,500 jobs by the end of 1999, bringing total employment down to 71,500. He sold some small businesses and closed some factories overseas. Now, he is trying to set up the remaining factories to make a greater variety of products, so that 3M can more easily shift production to countries with favorable currency exchange rates.
Perhaps most important, he has introduced a program, called Pacing Plus, to single out research projects with the potential to yield huge revenues -- to "change the nature of competition," as 3M puts it -- and speed them to market. Products from this program, like parts for ink-jet printer cartridges and environmentally safe fluids for cleaning electronic components, accounted for $1 billion in revenue last year, and Mr. Coyne predicted that a third of 3M's revenues would come from such projects -- probably most employing some form of microreplication -- by 2005.
"We've spent too much time on products that provide incremental, not significant, growth," Mr. Coyne said.
Still, 3M is taking pains to see that smaller projects are not eclipsed. Its three-year-old corporate enterprise department finances technologies, like a technique for time-releasing insect pheromones that might one day be used in pesticides, that no division is ready to take to market.
The company is even licensing innovations it cannot immediately use -- an unusual move for the generally secretive company. It licensed a method for making flexible printing plates to DuPont and it is looking for a licensee for a process for making glass panels for flat-screen televisions.
"Years ago we would have made the panels ourselves, but now we realize it's silly to go into glass manufacturing," Mr. Finocchiaro said.
Will 3M, once a regular on lists of most admired companies, regain its Wall Street sheen?
Many analysts say that it is finally on the right track, but they are skeptical nonetheless.
"Yes, 3M has changed," Mr. Henderson of Prudential said, summing up the prevailing Wall Street view. "But the question remains: has it changed enough?"

HEADLINE: A Pledge of Federal Help For the Economic Byways

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: HAZARD, Ky., July 5

 BODY:
The Clinton Years have been lush for lawyers, investment bankers and Internet explorers. But some pockets of America remain largely untouched by the prosperity of the 1990's, and President Clinton is devoting much of this week to bringing them compassion and the hope of new jobs.
Here in eastern Kentucky, where poverty and unemployment run two to three times higher than the national averages, the President today presented a package of proposals intended to spur investment among the idle coal fields. 
 Mr. Clinton hopes to use Federal tax credits and loan guarantees to inspire private companies to build plants and stores in Appalachia to serve a population that the economic boom has largely passed by.
It is a familiar strategy for this Administration, except that the proposed "new markets" are in economically distressed regions of the United States, not in Zimbabwe or Ukraine. The Administration has aggressively used Government tax breaks and loan subsidies to encourage investment by American corporations in developing countries, but it has never focused similar efforts in a systematic way on struggling communities in the United States.
"Even though this is a blessed time for America, not all Americans have been blessed by it," Mr. Clinton said before a heat-wilted crowd in this mountain town. "This is a time to bring more jobs and investment and hope to the areas of our country that have not fully participated in this economic recovery. We have an obligation to do it."
He picked the right place to make his point. David Deal, 58, a laid-off medical supply worker from the depressed coal-mining town of Cumberland, about 40 miles away, said that Government officials always talked about bringing jobs and investment to this region, but that the waiting continued.
"Lyndon Johnson was here in '64 but all the things he was talking about haven't reached down to the people here," Mr. Deal said. "Clinton keeps talking about wanting us off welfare, but he hasn't brought us any jobs."
One of his neighbors, Darlene Hall, 41, said that she was organizing a prayer rally in Cumberland next week to try to enlist God in the search for employment. And Ms. Hall said she had a message for industrialists looking for a stable work force.
"We are not pick-and-shovel uneducated people in the mountains," she said. "We are hard-working people, used to working in the mines. We are educated and we want to work."
With an entourage of corporate executives, members of Congress, Cabinet officers and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Mr. Clinton is embarked on a four-day, six-state tour of islands of poverty among the general prosperity. He plans to visit Clarksdale, Miss., a poor town in the Mississippi Delta; East St. Louis, Ill.; the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota; a barrio in Phoenix and the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.
He takes a briefcase full of what he hopes are tools to create jobs, including community development financial institutions, empowerment zones and enterprise communities, America's private investment companies, small-business investment companies, new-markets venture capital firms and new-markets lending companies.
Taken together, the new and existing programs are intended to prompt as much as $15 billion in private-sector investment in poor urban and rural areas over the next five years. Most of $1 billion in Federal subsidies to underwrite the programs would require Congressional action, but Mr. Clinton has not sent all the specific legislation to Capitol Hill.
Critics have questioned the timing of the initiative, coming in the seventh year of Mr. Clinton's Presidency, when he longer has need for the votes of suburban soccer moms or the financial support of wealthy donors. He has spent countless days canvassing the prosperous precincts of the nation over the last six and a half years, bringing comfort to the comfortable and shoveling up campaign contributions from equity-rich Democrats in Beverly Hills, Silicon Valley, Manhattan and Palm Beach.
Presidential aides said that Mr. Clinton spent his early years in office insuring the general welfare through fiscal discipline and targeted tax cuts that had cemented the fortunes of the middle class. Now he can turn to the 35 million Americans who remain mired in poverty as the tide of prosperity lifts the boats of others around them, they said.
"The fact that the country is doing so well right now may, indeed, provide a better atmosphere for the President to put this challenge to the private sector," said Gene Sperling, the White House's chief economic adviser. "In a period of prosperity like this, a Presidential message of bringing everybody along may be more well received, and you may be able to do more good now than if you were trying to do that at a time when the country, when everyone around the country, was hurting."
Today Mr. Clinton announced $1.5 million in housing and economic development grants to five eastern Kentucky groups from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The money is intended to provide improved housing for migrant workers, job training and subsidized mortgage loans, the department said.
Before he spoke here in Hazard, Mr. Clinton stopped in Tyner, an eastern Kentucky hamlet of mobile homes and 100 souls in Jackson County.
Mr. Clinton sought refuge from the wicked heat under a spreading walnut tree and spoke with Jean Collett, 48, who recently left her job as a cook at a Dairy Queen to care for her father, Ray Pennington, who suffers from emphysema and breathes with the aid of a portable oxygen tank.
Mr. Clinton sipped from a can of Mountain Dew and held Mr. Pennington's hand as Mrs. Collett explained the hardships of life in their pocket of Appalachia. Bank loans are hard to come by, she said, because lenders demand collateral, of which she has none.
"We don't even apply for them," she told the President.

HEADLINE: Minnesota's Ventura Tries to Lure Weicker Into the Presidential Race

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., July 5

 BODY:
Five winters ago, Lowell P. Weicker Jr. moved out of the Connecticut governor's mansion, apparently ending a 30-year career as one of the nation's best-known political mavericks. At 6 foot 6 and with a voice to match, he had tormented the Republican Party from within as a United States Senator, then led Connecticut as that uncommon American political animal, an independent.
After leaving Hartford, he settled into life as the lord of Applejack Farm, a former orchard in this town of private drives and tradesmen's entrances, taking plenty of time away for tennis, bird-watching and scuba diving with his seven sons and seven grandchildren. But he never lost his taste for the game that had been his life. He flirted with running for President as an independent in 1996, drawing national headlines, then backed away. 
 Now, strategists for Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota are trying to entice Mr. Weicker to offer himself as a Reform Party nominee for President. And Mr. Weicker, 68, sounds very much like a man who is willing to be enticed. In a conference call last week, he gave two of Governor Ventura's top aides permission to promote his candidacy as they prepared for a Reform Party national convention later this month.
The result could be an entertaining clash of egos in a Presidential race that had begun to look like it might be short on surprises. Ross Perot, the Reform Party's nominee in 1992 and 1996, has remained coy about his own plans for 2000. His support dropped from 19 percent of the vote in his first election to 8 percent last time.
So Governor Ventura, the former professional wrestler whose upset victory as a Reform Party candidate last November gave new hope to independents everywhere, has argued that the party needs new leaders if it is to grow. Working a second front, Mr. Ventura has endorsed a veteran of the term limits movement to replace the current party chairman, Russell J. Verney, a longtime lieutenant of Mr. Perot.
Mr. Weicker's prospects within the Reform Party may depend on the ferocious internal battle that leaders expect at the party's convention, to be held in Dearborn, Mich., from July 23 to 25. As part of his mission, Governor Ventura encouraged Mr. Weicker to run for President during a meeting in Manhattan last month, according to aides to both men. The meeting had been scheduled for half an hour and stretched to more than three, participants said.
"Would I like to run?" Mr. Weicker asked last week as he relaxed on his sun porch in a wrinkled French-cuff shirt with no cuff links. "Yes, sure -- it's been my business, and I still think I'm pretty good at the business."
Unprompted, he began reciting the pros and cons. "Do I care about the fact that you might get your head handed to you?" he asked. "Doesn't bother me -- never has. The opportunity to set a national dialogue on important subjects -- that's hugely appealing. I'm not afraid of handling myself, not afraid of the crunch -- not afraid of the campaign. What's the other side of the coin? I'm enjoying my family and enjoying a life style that I haven't had in my whole adult life."
Family may not prove much of a hurdle. Mr. Weicker's 21-year-old son, Sonny, teased his father, "Dad, you're running again." Mr. Weicker cautioned, "We don't know that, son."
His wife, Claudia T. Weicker, 52, a former Democratic aide on Capitol Hill, said she was trying not to think about it, but seemed ready. "Is there a void?" she asked. "Yes, there's a void. There need to be people spending more time advocating the cause of our children and of our minorities."
Several Reform Party officials said that although Governor Ventura has said he does not plan to run for President next year, he wants the Reform Party to field a credible candidate who will attract at least 5 percent of the vote, preserving the party's Federal financing and ballot status so he can run in 2004.
But the main motive for boosting Mr. Weicker, according to Douglas E. Friedline, who was Governor Ventura's campaign manager and now handles his licensing deals, is to give the Reform Party a face besides that of Mr. Perot. "Perot got us where we are, but now he's a liability," Mr. Friedline said. "Governor Ventura feels we need new leadership if we're going to grow."
Supporters of Mr. Weicker contend that an independent should have broad appeal this year -- partly because of what they believe will be a backlash against the ravenous fund-raising by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading Republican candidate, and partly because of disgust with the behavior by President Clinton that led to his impeachment in December.
Mr. Weicker, who endorsed Mr. Clinton in both his Presidential races, said he favored conviction on the articles of impeachment because the President apparently had lied in a legal proceeding.
"Right now, the country has to rebuild its faith in the Presidency," Mr. Weicker said.
Dean M. Barkley, who was chairman of Governor Ventura's campaign last year and remains a close adviser, said Mr. Weicker would be the most promising candidate short of Colin L. Powell, the retired general, who said through a spokesman that he still had no plans to seek any national office.
"Lowell Weicker shares with Governor Ventura the ability to speak from the heart and to show people that he understands their disgust with the political establishment," Mr. Barkley said, adding that he hoped Mr. Weicker would "run against the political process itself."
Based on the vote Mr. Perot received as the Reform Party's Presidential nominee in 1996, the party qualifies for $13 million in Federal funds for the general election, and can automatically be on the ballot in at least 19 states. Political analysts said that a Reform Party candidate could throw the outcome of the Presidential race in almost any state into doubt by attracting at least 10 percent of the vote.
Governor Ventura sent an E-mail message to the roughly 400 delegates last week endorsing a retired financial consultant, Jack Gargan, 68, for chairman to replace Mr. Verney. Mr. Gargan announced that one of his first steps would be to move the party headquarters from Dallas to his home state, Florida, which was seen as a signal that Governor Ventura was trying to take control of the party from Mr. Perot's forces.
Mr. Verney, the current chairman, said he has not decided whether to run again. Mr. Perot was traveling and could not be reached for comment, his spokesman said.
Reform Party leaders said that aside from Governor Ventura, General Powell and Mr. Weicker, the party's wish list for Presidential candidates is short. The only other names that came up during more than a dozen interviews were former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who now is seeking the Democratic nomination, and B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate for governor of New York in the past two elections.
Mr. Weicker is already encountering some static within the Reform Party, in part because he has never been associated with the movement. Some members are trading E-mail sniping at Mr. Weicker as being too establishment for their taste.
That notion might surprise those who remember him as the "Watergate white knight," who conducted his own investigation into wrongdoing by President Nixon, a fellow Republican.
After leaving public life, Mr. Weicker served for three years as a visiting professor at the University of Virginia, his law alma mater. He serves on six corporate boards and heads a study of possible links between environmental conditions and health problems, including asthma.
Mr. Weicker, who swims at 6:30 each morning at the Y.W.C.A. in Greenwich, said he wants to insure a centrist, independent option for voters. In his comments, a supporter might -- just might -- hear the early rumblings of a stump speech.
"The only way you're going to shape up American politics is by a third force, nationally," he said. "Politics -- the intellectual business -- is no different than the economic business. When you have an economic monopoly, you get high prices and bad products. You've got an intellectual monopoly in this country, and you've got bad ideas and bad candidates."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
For First Lady, Taking Detour On Geography

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The "Listening to New Yorkers" discussions that Hillary Rodham Clinton is planning for the exploratory phase of her Senate campaign will focus on familiar political issues: health care, public schools and the economy.
In truth, though, there is a more fundamental mission to these forums, and it has less to do with the problems facing the nation than with the problems confronting Mrs. Clinton's candidacy. 
 The real goal, Mrs. Clinton's advisers acknowledge, is less to educate her than to address what they see as her most serious vulnerability -- that she is seeking to represent in the Senate a state where she has never lived.
This is a case where what a candidate says may not matter, and according to her advisers, Mrs. Clinton plans to say very little of substance in the months ahead, starting with the six "Listening to New Yorkers" forums that she has scheduled this week in central New York.
Instead, her intention, aides said yesterday, is to spend so much time in New York, with a procession of cookie-cutter forums intended to produce a daily diet of television images, that her trips to the state become as routine as a visit by the First Lady can be. In that way, her aides hope that Mrs. Clinton, a native of Illinois, will become as familiar a part of the state's political geography as, say, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"In a couple of weeks, people are going to look and say, 'She's still out there,' " Mandy Grunwald, one of Mrs. Clinton's strategists, asserted. "And a couple of weeks later, they're going to look again and say she's STILL out there."
Whether Mrs. Clinton, who will formally register an exploratory committee for her campaign with Federal election officials today, can succeed at this strategy is open to question but is critical to her ambitions in New York.
Aides to Mr. Giuliani, the Republican who is also interested in running for the seat, are dubious that she can, as are some independent political analysts following the race.
Still, there is a factor working in her favor: The calendar. There are 16 months until the vote to replace Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is not running for re-election in 2000, and that is a huge stretch of time in American politics.
On the one hand, such a long campaign presents the risk of overexposure or campaign missteps. But it might also give Mrs. Clinton enough time so that by next year she can, with some credibility, claim ties to a state where she has never lived a day. And even if she can not quite get away with that assertion, it is a reasonable bet that over time, the issue of carpetbagging will lose some of its edge: that an attack that seems highly potent today will seem stale, particularly if it remains as much in the spotlight as it has been so far this year.
And from this perspective, Mr. Giuliani's relentless focus on Mrs. Clinton's residency seems an odd bit of political strategy, as even Mr. Giuliani's own supporters have begun to acknowledge. It is not that they think he should not raise the topic. But by doing it so soon, he may actually be helping to inoculate Mrs. Clinton from attacks on the issue next year, when they will really matter.
It may only be a matter of time until the press, and the public, tire of this topic and move on to other ones, which will make it harder to move the carpetbagger question back to center stage when the 2000 campaign comes around.
There is, one of the Mayor's friends said, no grand strategy being executed: it is only Mr. Giuliani being Mr. Giuliani. Another adviser, Bruce Teitelbaum, the head of Mr. Giuliani's political action committee, maintained that Mr. Giuliani was only responding to the inquiries of reporters.
But Mr. Giuliani certainly seems to encourage the questions.
He has, for example, decided to make a fund-raising trip to Little Rock, Ark. Little Rock is known for many things in American politics, including being the former home of a certain First Lady, but fund-raising is generally not one of them.
Inevitably, Mr. Giuliani's trip will provide the grist for a few more articles about Mrs. Clinton and carpetbagging, which may well be exactly what Mrs. Clinton needs right now.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Dirty Jobs in Politics And a New Breed of Diggers

SERIES: PRIVATE SPIES: The Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
Feeding an almost insatiable demand for negative information in today's world of bruising politics, private investigators are playing a larger -- though mostly hidden -- role in the public arena, digging up dirt on everyone from regulators to elected national and small-town officials.
President Clinton's use of private detectives has been widely reported. But an examination by The New York Times found that over the past decade they had moved into every corner of public life, hired by politicians and their surrogates, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry J. Hyde, the former Mayor of New York David N. Dinkins, and aspirants for local city councils. 
 The private investigators' thick reports are usually intended to discredit critics and dispose of opponents. But they are also used defensively, to identify and if possible to avoid potential embarrassments.
Today's breed of investigators includes former police officers, as always, but also former F.B.I. agents, ex-C.I.A. employees, former prosecutors and, in a trend that raises new ethical questions, ex-journalists, who can tap old news contacts to get negative information published.
Operating with little regulation or accountability, the detectives spy on opponents by posing as reporters or by sending in operatives who work as volunteers in the campaign. In a world where sensitive computer data can flow freely despite privacy laws, some routinely obtain protected information like phone records and medical histories.
They track down ex-spouses and former associates and employees, often concealing the reason they are asking questions, and they go through trash from offices, campaign headquarters and homes, a practice known as Dumpster diving.
"There's not a garbage pail I won't get in, not an angle I won't aim a hidden camera," said Larry Preston Williams, a former police intelligence officer in New Orleans, who sends every statewide candidate in Louisiana an offer to dig up "white lies" and other information about their opponents.
"I take cases from Republicans, Democrats, conservatives, liberals," Mr. Williams said. "It's all information."
No one knows how frequently private detectives are used in political campaigns. The Federal Election Commission says it cannot monitor campaign spending on them because payments are routinely lumped with fees to lawyers. And journalists who cooperate with detectives often promise confidentiality.
The Federal Government has, however, begun to examine some of the techniques that private investigators and information brokers use to obtain confidential information. In April the Federal Trade Commission filed a landmark suit against a Colorado investigator over the use of deceptions known as pretexts to obtain information about private bank accounts, and on June 25 state authorities indicted him on racketeering charges. Congress is considering legislation to outlaw pretexts.
 Personal attacks have been part of political campaigns since the nation's inception. But for most of this century unwritten rules kept within bounds what was called "opposition research." The typical investigator was a campaign worker or occasionally a moonlighting police officer. Inquiries focused on public information like voting records and court cases.
Those rules vanished after accusations of marital infidelity drove Gary Hart out of the race for President in 1988. Campaigns veered into nastier and more personal areas, and as they did, professional investigators replaced the amateurs and techniques got more aggressive. Today, even candidates reluctant to get into the muck say they feel compelled to respond in kind.
 Robert A. G. Monks, a candidate who hired detectives in a Republican primary for the Senate from Maine, defended the need for full disclosure, even if the information is painful and personal.
"One is thought of as being worse for calling attention to these things," Mr. Monks said. "I think it's wrong for people to run for office without making a disclosure of material facts."
Senator Kennedy offered a similar rationale for hiring private investigators to scrutinize his most recent opponent, Mitt Romney.
"Opposition research is part of the modern campaign process," said a Kennedy spokesman, Will Keyser. "In 1994, Senator Kennedy's record was an open book and his opponent's was largely unknown. It was important and appropriate for the campaign to conduct thorough research into all the available public information."
Ed Rollins, a veteran Republican political consultant who acknowledges using private investigators, said, "Most people today are trying to find as much dirt as they can. There may be less tendency to push the button on the personal stuff, but the digging is going right on."
This demand for dirt in politics arises during a boom era for private investigators in the business world. Started by the corporate takeovers of the early 1980's and fueled by computers, corporate investigators have become an essential part of the information economy.
Annual revenues have quintupled to $5 billion since 1980, according to one industry association, and investigators are pivotal players in everything from hostile takeovers to hiring executives and ferreting out internal fraud. The spillover into politics was natural.
But the best-known firms from the world of corporate snooping say they avoid the political arena for fear that fallout from the cases would damage their reputations and antagonize better-paying business clients.
"I'm not going to tell you that we haven't looked up a name for someone in politics, but it is the policy of the company that we don't do political work," said Michael G. Cherkasky, president of Kroll Associates, the world's largest corporate investigative firm.
"There are certain things that we tend not to do because they are dirty," Mr. Cherkasky said. "We don't do matrimonial, we don't do criminal defense and we don't do political."
Michael J. Hershman, chairman of Decision Strategies Fairfax International, another large firm, said his investigators examined the backgrounds of Vice-Presidential possibilities for the Dukakis and Clinton campaigns, but with their knowledge and cooperation.
"We've taken a strong policy position on not doing political opposition research," Mr. Hershman said, "and I am personally against opposition research, which I believe adds to the scourge of negative campaigning."
One of the few major firms that solicits political cases is Investigative Group International, the Washington company run by Terry F. Lenzner, a former Watergate prosecutor. Though best known as an investigator for Mr. Clinton's lawyers, Mr. Lenzner has also worked for Republicans, including former Representative Michael Huffington in his losing Senate race in California against Dianne Feinstein.
Several years ago, Mr. Lenzner created a division called Campaign Facts to specialize in political investigations. He also maintains a tiny law firm, Terry F. Lenzner P.C., which several former employees said is used partly to provide politically sensitive inquiries an extra layer of confidentiality through attorney-client privilege.
Last year Mr. Lenzner was subpoenaed by the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr to testify before a grand jury about inquiries into Mr. Clinton's critics and two of Mr. Starr's prosecutors. Mr. Lenzner said he was not a target of the grand jury but, stung by the controversy, now even he is considering cutting back on political work.
In an interview, Mr. Lenzner said political cases represented only a fraction of his firm's revenue, though he defended such work.
"I perceive it to be analogous to a hostile takeover case where we are hired by a company to gather information to convince shareholders to vote for our client," he said. "You are looking at substantive issues that are relevant to the voters."
 
The Defense
Lawmaker Worried About Thrift Role
 Representative Hyde, the House Judiciary chairman, turned to a private detective when a critic was trying to draw attention to his role in a failed savings and loan.
In an interview, the detective, Ernie Rizzo, a former police officer in a Chicago suburb, provided details of his work for Mr. Hyde for the first time -- and described his disdain for politicians.
"Politicians are the easiest people in the world to set up," Mr. Rizzo said. "They're all whores. You stay with them for a week and you'll catch them doing something -- women or money or something. Forget about the millions spent in political campaigns. You don't need that. Everybody got to the top by stepping over somebody. Find the weakest link and attack it."
Mr. Rizzo, as a lone operator, is typical of detectives who handle political work. A character who would be at home in a Damon Runyon story, he is outgoing and flashy; his holographic business card is emblazoned with the image of a spy and six phone numbers, including one for his boat.
Mr. Rizzo said he was hired in late 1995 by James Schirott, a lawyer defending Mr. Hyde in a Federal suit against him and other former directors of Clyde Federal Savings and Loan. The thrift's failure in 1990 cost taxpayers $67 million.
Mr. Schirott, he said, told him the Congressman was concerned about a man turning up at hearings on the suit. Mr. Hyde wanted to know who the man was and what he knew. The lawyer gave Mr. Rizzo a name, Tim Anderson, and an address in Libertyville, a suburb of Chicago.
"The first thing I did was I pulled phone records," Mr. Rizzo explained. "I saw Anderson was making 30 or 40 calls a day to the media. I told Hyde, but he still didn't know who he was. I saw the media calls, so I decided to pretend I was from the media."
He said he telephoned Mr. Anderson, claiming to be a producer for "20/20," the ABC news program. Mr. Anderson agreed to meet him near O'Hare International Airport.
Getting a target's phone records is often the starting point of an inquiry, investigators say. While Mr. Rizzo was convicted of illegal wiretapping in 1977 for taping conversations in divorce cases, privacy experts say phone records fall into a gray area in most states. Mr. Rizzo said he got the records from someone at a telephone company, and the Illinois Attorney General's office said no state law was violated. A spokesman for Ameritech, the regional telephone company based in Chicago, said that the company did not provide customer records to anyone without a court order and that any employee who violated the rule would be fired.
Mr. Rizzo said he flew to New York and took a flight back to Chicago in case Mr. Anderson watched the airport for his arrival. But Mr. Anderson was not suspicious. A former banking consultant, he had contacted dozens of journalists trying to expose what he believed were the political roots of the savings and loan scandal.
Mr. Anderson said he gladly gave Mr. Rizzo his material on Mr. Hyde -- a bound file containing 388 pages of court records, newspaper articles and documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.
Among the documents were minutes of Clyde Federal board meetings that showed Mr. Hyde playing a more active role than he had acknowledged publicly. In one instance, he approved an investment in speculative options trading that eventually lost $10 million.
Mr. Rizzo, however, also wanted to know about Mr. Anderson, especially any vulnerabilities he had. So, the detective said: "I warned him that Hyde was going to come after us and I had to make sure he didn't have any skeletons. I got him telling me all his weak spots."
Mr. Rizzo said he gave the file to Mr. Hyde and was paid by a political ally of the Congressman, not by his lawyer.
Last October, The Chicago Tribune disclosed Mr. Rizzo's duping of Mr. Anderson. In his interview with The Times, Mr. Rizzo revealed that just two months later, in December, he employed the technique again because Mr. Hyde and his allies feared that Mr. Anderson might use the disclosure to disrupt the Clinton impeachment hearings.
"The day before the impeachment trial started in the House, I sent two guys back in," Mr. Rizzo said. "They posed as reporters. We wanted to know if Anderson was going to sue Hyde or make any other noise. But he told them he wasn't going to sue. He was on a crusade. It was hilarious."
Mr. Hyde refused to be interviewed for this article, but a spokesman disputed several aspects of Mr. Rizzo's account.
The spokesman, Sam Stratman, said Mr. Hyde was told that Mr. Anderson had been investigated, but that Mr. Rizzo did not deliver his findings to the Congressman. Mr. Hyde never met Mr. Rizzo and had no knowledge of his techniques, the spokesman said. Mr. Stratman also said $2,000 of $20,000 in fees paid to Mr. Schirott was for Mr. Rizzo's services. Mr. Schirott did not return numerous phone calls from The Times over several weeks.
In 1997 the Federal Government settled its suit with the former Clyde Federal directors for $850,000. Mr. Hyde maintained he had no responsibility for the thrift's failure and he did not contribute to the settlement.
Mr. Anderson is carrying on, working for $7.50 an hour at Enterprise Rent-a-Car to provide time for his crusade, even though his wife has pleaded with him to give up and return to his profession.
Indeed, Mr. Anderson said the Congressman's investigation had strengthened his resolve.
"I'm an innocent member of the public and the head of the Judiciary Committee hired a detective to spy on me," he said indignantly.
 
The Success
Helping Defeat David Duke
 Compared with flashy Mr. Rizzo, Larry Preston Williams is a model of decorum, given to three-piece suits and understatement.
An ex-lawyer and former New Orleans police officer, Mr. Williams estimates that political cases represent 15 percent of his business as a private investigator. While clients occasionally send him after national politicians, his usual target is a candidate for local or state office in Louisiana and other Southern states.
"The number of cases has picked up in recent years," he said. "The aggressiveness has picked up. The willingness to use information publicly to simply obliterate the opposition forever has increased."
Mr. Williams will happily plow through a subject's garbage, but his time is more often spent wading through public records looking for lawsuits, unpaid taxes, property ownership, divorces, arrests and the like. He charges $50 to $150 an hour, depending on the complexity of the case. A routine investigation costs $3,000 to $4,000.
What turns up most often is mundane, too: candidates or officials who misrepresent work history, education or military service. Baby boomers are particularly likely to fabricate service in Vietnam or a Purple Heart, he said.
In one case, a candidate for the New Orleans City Council hired Mr. Williams to investigate whether an opponent met residency requirements. The results of the two-month inquiry filled a folder two inches thick and ranged from letters from former employers verifying employment dates to lists of credit cards and phone records.
Mr. Williams leaked the information to reporters, leading to newspaper articles that questioned whether the candidate, Ellen Hazeur, met the residency requirement. Voters did not seem to care; Ms. Hazeur won.
Mr. Williams compiled a thicker dossier on David E. Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader whose Republican candidacies for the Louisiana Legislature and Congress have roiled the state's politics for the past decade.
The investigation turned up some early evidence linking Mr. Duke to neo-Nazis, and his client, a prominent Republican, used the report to orchestrate a campaign publicizing Mr. Duke's white supremacist ties.
For clients willing to spend $50,000 or more, Mr. Williams advises hiring a detective to start digging a year before the election. That enables them to start a trickle of negative information about their opponent that builds to a crescendo just before the election. He would not identify any clients who took that course.
 
The Backlash
An Instigator Places Last
 For W. John Hathaway, the negative information was not a trickle but an explosion. Running for the Republican nomination for senator from Maine in 1996, he watched in shock as two major newspapers published articles the same day reporting that he had been accused of having a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old baby sitter.
Six years earlier, when he lived in Huntsville, Ala., a girl who sat for Mr. Hathaway's children had claimed she had a sexual relationship with him. He denied the accusation. Two District Attorneys and the state Attorney General investigated and decided not to prosecute at the request of the girl's parents. In a recent interview, Mr. Hathaway again denied the accusation and said he had expected it to remain secret because no charges had been filed.
But rumors began to circulate during the primary, in which Mr. Hathaway was one of three Republicans vying for the seat left open by William S. Cohen. The others were Robert A. G. Monks, an established political figure in Maine, and Susan Collins, a political newcomer.
As the primary approached, Mr. Monks became alarmed, he said in a recent interview. His polls showed Mr. Hathaway the likely winner, and nothing had surfaced about the baby sitter's accusation. He turned to Mr. Lenzner, whom he had known for years, authorizing him to dispatch detectives from I.G.I. to Alabama to investigate.
"It isn't as if it was a secret," Mr. Monks recalled. "It was a piece of information that was something that people didn't want to have anything to do with."
A person involved in the I.G.I. investigation said detectives interviewed the girl's mother and other people and provided a report to the Monks campaign. Five days before the primary, The Boston Globe and Portland Press Herald published articles about the accusation, reporting that Mr. Hathaway had denied the charges and had never been arrested.
After the articles appeared, Mr. Hathaway accused Mr. Monks of leaking the story. Mr. Monks admitted hiring a detective, but denied that his efforts led to the articles. Even that admission took a toll on Mr. Monks. He finished last, with Mr. Hathaway second and Ms. Collins, who had refused to comment on the controversy, winning.
"The whole thing blew up in Monks's face," said Christian P. Potholm, a government professor at Bowdoin College. "People felt that this was not something that a Bill Cohen or a George Mitchell would have done."
It is not clear whether I.G.I. played a role in either article. Investigators usually turn over information to the client and let the campaign decide how to handle it.
Stephen Kurkjian, the lead reporter on The Globe's article, said that he might have talked to an I.G.I. investigator, but that an editor had sent him to Huntsville on a tip.
"I had the story without them," Mr. Kurkjian said.
Steve Campbell of The Press Herald would not identify his initial source, saying: "It didn't matter where it was coming from. I was more concerned with whether the rumors were factual."
In the recent interview, Mr. Monks said his staff had discussed the information with reporters. He still denied that the investigators were behind the articles, but he acknowledged opening a Pandora's box by sending them to Alabama.
"Once someone had stuck their hand in the thicket," he said, "the information began to flow."
 
The Fallout
Battling in Court In a Libel Case
No incident better demonstrates the power of private investigators than the runoff for Houston mayor in 1991 between Bob Lanier, a millionaire businessman, and Sylvester Turner, a Harvard-educated lawyer and State Representative.
Six days before the vote, Houston's ABC affiliate broadcast a report questioning whether Mr. Turner had a role in an insurance scam in which a former law client had faked drowning. It said Mr. Turner had drawn up the man's will shortly before he disappeared and had been involved in efforts to collect his insurance money. It quoted Mr. Turner as saying that he was a victim of the scam and had cooperated with investigators.
Pollsters from the University of Houston interviewing voters the night the story was broadcast watched Mr. Turner's numbers plunge.
"Until then, the race was very close, with a slight but statistically insignificant advantage to Turner," said Richard Murray, who supervised the poll. "We could see the direct effect. Turner dropped eight points."
Mr. Turner blamed Mr. Lanier for the report, an accusation that the campaign and the TV station denied. Mr. Turner never recovered and lost by the eight-point margin.
Mr. Turner later sued the station and its investigative reporter for libel, and in trial in 1996 the link between the Lanier campaign and the broadcast was finally discovered. A private investigator on Mr. Lanier's campaign finance committee had delivered a one-page summary of the accusations to the reporter and arranged for him to receive court files about the faked death, according to testimony.
After the election, the investigator and a second detective who also played a role in providing the story to the TV station received a multimillion-dollar contract from the Lanier administration to collect overdue parking fines.
The jury found that the broadcast was false and that the station had shown a reckless disregard for the truth, and it awarded Mr. Turner $5.5 million, a figure the judge reduced to $3.25 million. Last December, an appellate court set aside the verdict, ruling that Mr. Turner was a public figure and that there was no clear and convincing evidence of a reckless disregard for the truth in the broadcast. Mr. Turner has appealed.
In an interview, Mr. Turner criticized the private investigators.
"They did not care anything about the person, or family, or common decency," he said. "They were hired to do a job -- and they were successful."

NATO and Moscow Agree On Russian Role in Kosovo
NATO and Russian military commanders resolved their differences over Russia's role in the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, clearing the way for about 3,600 more Russian troops to enter the province. Officials said the first planeloads could begin arriving today. The Russians agreed -- with great reluctance, officials said -- to serve under the nominal control of the allied commanders of each sector where they will operate, but they reserved the right to refuse to carry out orders. A1
 
The Kosovo village Bela Crkva buried its dead in a bitter, tearful ceremony. Most of the 64 people laid to final rest had initially been buried furtively, at night, by other villagers near where the victims were shot to death, reportedly by Serbian forces hours after the NATO bombing began. The reburial came after war crimes investigators completed their work in the town. A1
 
Trouble for Pakistani Leader
Opposition political parties at home criticized Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for promising in Washington to withdraw Pakistani-backed forces from the Indian side of the cease-fire line in the disputed territory of Kashmir. Mr. Sharif's pledge seemed to be viewed by most Pakistanis as a sell-out of the Kashmir cause or an ill-fated move in a diplomatic game of chess. A3
 
Barak Cabinet Is Complete
The Prime Minister-elect of Israel, Ehud Barak, named a Finance Minister, a Justice Minister and others to complete his ministerial appointments. Mr. Barak and his Cabinet are expected to be be sworn in today. A7
 
Agency Head Assails Policy
J. Brian Atwood, the departing director of the Agency for International Development, the Government's major foreign aid agency, criticized the Administration for allowing itself to be "pushed around" by Congress and warned that legislative cuts in foreign aid had created a crisis. A4
 
Mexico Results and Predictions
The candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has won every presidential election since the 1920's, won election as governor of the state of Mexico, the country's most populous. His victory challenged thinking that the party, known as the PRI, was flagging and would be unable to mount a viable campaign for the presidency next year. But a PRI loss in another governor's race also showed opposition parties the power that can come from their joining forces. A8
 
Somalia Cracks Down on Crime
Four self-appointed Islamic courts in Mogadishu began a huge counterbanditry operation as part of efforts to restore order in the capital, officials said. The courts have already closed dozens of illegal checkpoints, where the city's various rival militia groups terrorize local residents and extort money. (Reuters)

Gunman Had a History Of Hate-Filled Acts
Benjamin Smith, who the F.B.I. said killed himself late Sunday rather than be captured after a deadly rampage directed at members of minorities in Illinois and Indiana, had become increasingly bold in expressing his racist views, people who had encountered him said. Last year, while a college student, he outraged neighborhoods in Bloomington, Ind., by tossing plastic bags containing white supremacist pamphlets into thousands of yards. A1
 
New Political Players
Private investigators are playing a larger role in the public arena, digging up dirt on people like regulators, elected national and small-town officials. Their reports are usually aimed at discrediting or disposing of their clients' critics or opponents, but they are also used defensively, to find and avoid potential embarrassments. And their ranks are increasingly being joined by ex-journalists, who can tap old news contacts to get negative information published. A1
 
Gore, Bush and Female Voters
Al Gore is trailing George W. Bush among women, despite a determined effort by Mr. Gore and his campaign to appeal to female voters. Advisers suggest that Mr. Gore may be a casualty of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, though the Vice President himself rejected that notion in an interview. A13
 
Democrats are talking up the idea of Mr. Gore naming a woman as running mate. But who? A13
 
Plan to Lift Appalachia
President Clinton, visiting eastern Kentucky, presented a package of proposals intended to increase investment in the idle coal fields, which have largely been bypassed by the prosperity of the 1990's. The plan would use Federal tax credits and loan guarantees to induce private companies and investors to build plants and stores. A10
 
Election of Church Leader
The United Church of Christ, a 1.4 million-member denomination that traces some of its roots back to the Puritans, elected as its president the Rev. John H. Thomas, 48, who is widely known for his work in ecumenical relations. He succeeds the Rev. Paul Sherry. A11
 
Plea in Maryland Slaying
A Maryland teen-ager pleaded not guilty in an Israeli court to murder charges arising from a 1997 killing in Maryland. The teen-ager, Samuel Sheinbein, 19, did admit to dismembering the victim's body and burying it. But his lawyer challenged the prosecution to prove that Mr. Sheinbein had actively participated in the killing with a friend, who committed suicide in a Maryland prison before his trial was to begin. Mr. Sheinbein, whose father was born in Israel, fled to Israel, whose Supreme Court ruled that he is an Israeli citizen and therefore could not be extradited. A13

HEADLINE: Gore Campaign, Trailing Among Women, Sharpens Its Pitch to Them

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
The first thing Al Gore mentioned in every speech last week was that his oldest daughter was past her due date and about to make him and his wife of 29 years grandparents. (Wyatt Gore Schiff, 6 pounds 3 ounces, finally arrived on the Fourth of July, timing that the Vice President will surely mention in future speeches.)
The second thing he told crowds was that he had been reared by a mother who grew up poor, got on a bus to Nashville with her blind sister in tow, waited tables for quarter tips and, in 1936, became one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School. 
 When he listened as a child to the daily back and forth between his parents, "it was clear to me that men and women were equal -- if not more so," Mr. Gore said, drawing whoops from his listeners at every stop.
In his run for the White House, the Vice President is aggressively pursuing female voters, the increasingly important bloc that so far seems to favor George W. Bush slightly. And the pitch is not terribly subtle.
Whenever possible, Mr. Gore is introduced to his audiences by a woman. (Christine Meyer, the mother of a 3-year-old cancer survivor, did the honors before his Philadelphia speech last week supporting cancer research. "I said my husband is really the speaker," Ms. Meyer said in an interview, "but they said no, we want you to do it. They wanted a mom's perspective.")
Mr. Gore steps onstage to the tune of "Rock This Country," a country song by a female vocalist, Shania Twain. A campaign video focuses primarily on him as husband and father, with his daughter Karenna Schiff repeatedly assuring viewers that her dad is so funny.
Then comes his standard stump speech, chock full of talk about day care, early-childhood education and gender equality. "This pledge," he says, "is in honor of my mother: an equal day's pay for an equal day's work."
He promises also to "fight for the ability to balance work and family" and "to shield our children from gun violence." And his biggest applause line is usually his vow to "make sure we have high-quality preschool available for every child."
This wildly woman-friendly agenda is not a poll-tested new focus for the Vice President. Mr. Gore has worked on these issues throughout his public life, co-sponsoring early versions of the Family and Medical Leave Act in the Senate and a series of bills on women's health in the House as far back as the early 1980's.
He opposed Federal financing of abortion early in his House career, but has been a supporter of abortion rights for many years and was a Senate co-sponsor of a bill that would have made a Federal statute of Roe v. Wade. He has surrounded himself with accomplished women who have become some of his closest aides, and he is considered by his staff to be an unusually family-friendly employer.
Still, his campaign is without question reacting to polls suggesting that at least at this early date, American women, who have heavily favored Democrats in recent elections, seem to prefer Mr. Bush, an opponent of abortion.
David Beckwith, a Bush spokesman, said the Governor's "compassionate conservatism" appealed to everybody. Even when Mr. Bush ran for governor in 1994 against a female incumbent, Ann Richards, there was virtually no gender gap, Mr. Beckwith noted: 49 percent of Texas women who went to the polls, like 53 percent of the men, supported Mr. Bush.
Though women favored Bill Clinton over Bob Dole by 16 percentage points in 1996, one recent CNN poll had them backing Mr. Bush over Mr. Gore by 11 points. (The Vice President was farther behind among men, by 21 points.)
Political consultants from both parties see the Gore numbers at least in part as evidence of displaced anger over the President's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Even Mr. Gore's new pollster, Celinda Lake, agrees that the Lewinsky scandal appears to be suppressing his ratings with women.
"There's been a delayed reaction to the Clinton factor that's unfair to Gore," said Ms. Lake, who specializes in tracking female voters and was brought on last week to help the campaign figure them out. "But to women, the personal is political. As they get to know him, they'll see he's quite un-Clintonesque in that regard."
In an interview, the Vice President expressed surprise that anyone could think he might somehow wind up taking the fall for the Lewinsky scandal. "I don't buy it," he said.
Certainly his campaign is working hard to make sure that does not happen, recruiting women to fill the seats at his events, to come and hear his direct appeals. "Working to close that gap," Ms. Lake said, "is one of the most important tasks of the campaign."
After receiving from the headquarters of Mr. Gore's Pennsylvania campaign "three begging phone calls indicating they need women," Maureen Kelly, a Pittsburgh lawyer, agreed to attend a fund-raising luncheon last week, at a discounted rate. Patricia McGrail, another lawyer, attended with her and also got a discount, paying $300, she said, for the $1,000 ticket.
Ms. Kelly responded positively to Mr. Gore's remarks, and said: "I feel bad for him. People are going to associate him with Clinton, when in fact he embodies the values most women want to see."
In private, Mr. Gore talks about the important women in his life with a respect that does suggest, as several women who heard him speak last week said, that "he gets it."
As he chatted on Air Force Two, in a conversation that was initially off the record, the Vice President's mind was on his pregnant daughter. Would he cancel his schedule when she went into labor?
"I don't know," he said. "You want to run to the hospital and be right there with her, but then again. . . .
"Got to give her her space," he said, laughing at himself. "Her mother has perfect pitch on this stuff, so I guess I'll just follow her lead."
(Mr. Gore also disclosed that while environmentalists are split over Pampers vis-a-vis cloth diapers, he favors the easy way out. "That's not a hard call," he joked. "Global warming is hard. Pampers are easy.")
Most of the women attending Gore campaign events at this point are active Democrats, of course. But during three days of almost nonstop campaign events last week, a number of women said, essentially, that they felt he was pandering, yes, and maybe even desperate -- yet also totally sincere.
While commentators have primarily looked at the ways in which Mr. Gore is not enough like Mr. Clinton as a campaigner, his audiences seemed to be focusing more on what the Vice President said than on how he said it. They liked the story about his mother, and they loved the line "I'm running to make America not just better off, but better."
At a reception in Philadelphia, one supporter, Lynne Gold-Bikin, said she had been appalled by the poll numbers showing women favoring Mr. Bush -- "that Texan," as she called him.
"How any woman," she said, "could prefer the Governor of the state that pushes Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, who are so anti-woman I can't even think about it, over this man who is pro-choice and has this wonderful, exciting wife? I don't understand."
In Miami, at yet another fund-raising luncheon, Mayor Alex Penelas announced to Mr. Gore: "The real person who should be introducing you is my wife. If you say you're not voting for Al Gore, she'll punch you in the nose. And she's the Republican in the family."
When she did come to the microphone, Mrs. Penelas was as believable as she was enthusiastic: "Most people I tell them my father was Basque, they say, 'What is that?' " When she told Mr. Gore, however, "he told me all about their customs, he gave me an education on the Basque people -- now I say, that's knowledge."
Mr. Gore took it from there, and started in with how excited he was about becoming an abuelo (a grandfather), racing through this one Spanish word as if someone had told him that the key to fluency was talking fast.
Afterward, Elsa Lopez, a single mother among his listeners, said she felt he had been talking to her. "We need quality day care," she said, "not some ranch to farm these kids out on."
"Education, and choice -- my daughter just turned 4, but I decided to have her -- these things are all key," said Ms. Lopez, a former Republican who now works for the teachers' union and said she was thrilled to have received a free ticket to the $1,000 event.
Not all women were wowed, of course, by the candidate or his focus on them.
"He kept bringing up women's issues," said Ms. McGrail, the Pittsburgh lawyer, who is a Democrat and the mother of three.
"I felt like he was dealing with soft issues," she said. "I'm 44 years old; I'm too old for that. I wanted to hear about something more relevant to my life, like economic development."
In fact, the presentation she heard seems to have convinced Ms. McGrail that Mr. Gore is probably too sensitive to lead the country, and at this point she is thinking of supporting Elizabeth Dole.
"Not because she's a woman," Ms. McGrail said, "but because I think she'd be a strong leader. She's tough."

HEADLINE: Why a Car Is Better Than Cash

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Robert H. Frank (Op-Ed, June 30) suggests that as a highly skilled employee, you'd probably like to receive a BMW instead of a pay raise, since "you've wanted to make such a purchase but your spouse insists on remodeling the kitchen instead." 
 However, most employees qualifying for BMW's are men.
When raises are replaced by gifts used by husbands, their wives benefit less from their husband's success at work.
Men who entered marriages in which both spouses made equal salaries are pushing for bonuses they can play with, hoping that their wives won't mind the reduction in their contribution to the family's earnings. I would be surprised if successful companies that are directed by women compensate their employees by giving them luxury cars.

CRH said the total costs of the acquisition will rise to $146 million, including costs for disposing of some assets. Millington Quarry and Dell, which does road work, had combined 1998 sales of $149 million and combined operating profits of $18 million, CRH said. 
 CRH's Oldcastle unit in the United States is expanding amid sluggish economic growth in Europe, and amid expectations that the United States construction market will continue to boom as the Federal Government plans to spend about $180 billion on roads within six years.
Tom Hill, president of Oldcastle, said CRH will integrate the purchases into its current businesses in the region to reduce costs. About half of CRH's annual sales are in the United States market, it has said.
CRH acquired Tilcon Inc. in New Britain, Conn., in 1996 and New York Trap Rock in New Hamburg and West Nyack, N.Y., in 1997.

HEADLINE: High Noon: Restaurants Fight to Draw a Crowd

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
A BUSINESS lunch today is positively Spartan compared with those fabled three-martini events a quarter-century ago. The martinis have been replaced by iced tea, mineral water, possibly a single glass of wine. The hearty dishes that lingered until dinner, like pot-au-feu, have become grilled chicken or a salad. The leisurely two-hour interlude has slipped back to an hour or less and, for many, into carryout at the desk or sandwiches in the conference room.
As lunch has come under increasing pressures of time, budgets and health concerns, many restaurants have realized that they must adapt, or face empty tables. They have chosen to give customers what they want, like two appetizers and a beverage in 45 minutes, or a meal ready to go in a container. And they are having some success. 
 In an effort to fill its tables at noon, Lespinasse, one of New York City's temples of gastronomy, recently sent a promotion to its customers: "In the 70's you had lunch. In the 80's you did lunch. In the 90's you skipped lunch. Perhaps it's time you redefined lunch." The restaurant has done just that: three light courses for $36 in one hour.
"People want to eat fast and furiously," said Eberhard Muller, the chef and owner of Lutece. "Years ago, you could serve the French classics, but you can't sell them anymore. Now it's salads, grilled fish, grilled meats, less starch, more protein and healthier than ever and 'please make it fast I have to be back at the office in one hour.' "
Except for prix fixe meals, most people eat no more than two courses, often just an entree. Lunch has become a time to abstain, dinner a time to splurge.
"It's an image thing," said Chris Cannon, a partner at Judson Grill. "It makes them look serious and healthy in front of customers." It's a far cry from the days when a boozy haze was the desired effect and not much work was done in the afternoon.
"Now, it's tons of water, iced tea and cranberry spritzers and $22,000 coffee machines that make six kinds of coffee: cappuccino, espresso, double cappuccino, double this, double that," said Alan Stillman, who owns Smith & Wollensky, Maloney & Porcelli and Manhattan Ocean Club. But wine by the glass is selling, and to protect that single-glass toehold, some restaurants have enlarged and upgraded the choices.
When Union Square Cafe opened in 1985, it offered two wines by the glass; today there are 10. Eleven Madison Park, a sister restaurant, offers 36. "People are drinking only one glass of wine, but they are willing to pay," said Charles Palmer, owner of Aureole on the Upper East Side. His list includes a $26 glass of a 1996 Chateauneuf-du-Pape.
Restaurants that want to stay in business cater to the changing demands of their clientele, even if they don't approve. If a good customer wants a meal boxed up to eat at the desk, even the fanciest places will oblige. In the old days, Mr. Muller said, when a guest asked for sauce on the side, chefs would refuse. Today the customer is always right.
"We still have a three-course prix fixe lunch for $38," Mr. Muller said, "but now if someone wants two courses we won't refuse. If someone wants a bowl of soup and a salad, be my guest. My lunch business, based on these subtle changes, is much better than three years ago, by being in tune with what people want to eat and their time."
Even in steakhouses, only about a third of the lunch entrees are steak; at dinner they account for 85 percent of the meals.
"You have to give the appearance on the menu of healthful dishes," said Mr. Cannon of Judson Grill. "But people don't want a spa menu, because they don't want to feel like they are going to some spa." Which is exactly what the Four Seasons, considered by many to be the power center of the midday meal, learned several years ago.
"The spa menu was a great idea for a year or so," said Julian Niccolini, a managing partner. "People are interested in eating healthy food, in very fresh, freshly prepared organic food. They are interested in flavors. Great food doesn't have to be with sauces."
In fact, said Rocco DiSpirito, the chef at Union Pacific, simple is better. "People may not be able to enjoy interesting or complicated food at lunch," he said, because they don't have the time. "We've simplified our lunch menu so you're not needing the waiter to explain everything to you."
Elaine Markson, a Manhattan literary agent, appreciates efforts at simplicity. "When I first started, lunch was incredibly exciting," Ms. Markson said. "Now, I try to make it as healthy as I can. No drinking. Water, water, water, unless I have a foreign guest. If I'm trying to be good, it's two appetizers and coffee. Now I'm not looking at the breadbasket. Desserts are out, out, out, unless you are with someone who is very thin and wants you to share a dessert."
Time and health are not the only influences on the changing lunch business. There are hundreds of new options to fill the gaping culinary and price differential between the Four Seasons and the corner deli. Not the least of these is the corporate dining room, an increasingly standard feature at large companies. Conde Nast, which moved to its new headquarters at Broadway and 43d Street last month, will soon be operating an elaborate Frank Gehry-designed dining room for its staff and for in-house entertaining. Investment bankers like Credit Suisse First Boston are providing employees with in-house dining as well as a health club, a hair salon and a dry cleaner.
These amenities save companies time and money. "It's the most efficient utilization of time from our standpoint," said Luther Terry, a managing director of Credit Suisse. The executive dining rooms are also used to entertain clients, providing privacy that a public restaurant cannot.
"Corporate dining rooms were considered ostentatious once," said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant. "No longer."
The booming economy has also created hundreds of new restaurants, and, Mr. Wolf said, the number of seats exceeds the demand. In some neighborhoods the competition among top restaurants is particularly fierce. Over the last six months, 700 seats have been added in the Madison Park area: Union Pacific, Patria and Gramercy Tavern have been joined by Veritas, Tabla and 11 Madison Park. Cena, a highly regarded restaurant in the neighborhood, closed last week for lack of business.
"It's very difficult to get people in the door," said Mr. DiSpirito of Union Pacific. "We used to average 70 to 80 for lunch; now the average is 50. We were counting on the Credit Suisse to be a big source of revenue, but I don't think they leave their desks."
They don't need to leave their building, anyway, the same one that houses 11 Madison Park and Tabla, Danny Meyer's two new restaurants.
Mr. Meyer, too, was counting on the 2,000 employees of Credit Suisse. A shrewd businessman, he decided that if they wouldn't come to him, he would go to them. In the next few weeks, he will begin delivering $12 box lunches (sandwich, dessert and beverage) to those people and selling to anyone who wants to pick one up.
Even restaurants that must be booked weeks in advance for dinner are finding that they need incentives to draw people in for lunch. The annual one-week promotion when dozens of the city's top restaurants offer a prix fixe lunch -- $19.99 this year -- is frequently extended for the entire year. At the Gotham Bar and Grill, the $19.99 lunch accounts for about half the lunch business, said the owner, Jerome Kretchmer, whose other restaurants include Park Avenue Cafe, Judson Grill and Mesa Grill. "It gets lots of people to come," he added.
Paul McLaughlin, a managing partner of Oceana and Molyvos, called last year's $19.98 lunch at Molyvos a "win-win situation, with 250 people a week out of 800 or 900 buying that lunch, which will probably be a permanent feature."
Other restaurants offer limited, less expensive menus at the bar. A three-course lunch in the lounge at Le Cirque 2000 is $25. Le Bernardin began the Timely Lunch Menu 18 months ago, and Eric Ripert, the chef, insists that it can be served in less than 30 minutes. The $32 three-course prix fixe has increased business from about 80 or 90 noontime customers to more than 100.
To be sure, in the throngs of rushed and hungry New Yorkers, there are holdouts -- most often in publishing and advertising, where people still "do lunch."
Paul Gottlieb, the publisher and president of Harry Abrams, remembers the old-style lunch fondly. "Lunch was always a moment of relaxation, a time to catch up," he said. "It still is, for me, a moment out of the day."
Ms. Markson, the literary agent, has been eating lunch out five days a week for 27 years. "Lunch is absolutely the lifeline," she said. "It's the leisure of lunch that makes the deal happen. I don't know what I'd do without it."
And there are still some restaurants that don't need to offer incentives to fill up. Judson Grill, Union Square Cafe, Michael's and the Four Seasons, which all cater to those who do lunch, are almost always booked. Regulars think of those places as their private clubs, where they are known and feel comfortable. The Four Seasons is the ultimate lunch club, but even it is relatively quiet on a getaway day.
"The only day we have a problem is on Friday," Mr. Niccolini said. "People want to get out of town as quickly as possible, and in the summer they don't want to come to work at all on Friday. People are making so much money, many don't have to, and because of the Internet they can work at home."
Indeed, just when lunch patterns seem to have settled in, something comes along to unsettle them. Corporate dining rooms are one thing, but the Internet may take an even greater toll on restaurant lunch. Who needs to go out for poached salmon when the deal can be done in a flash on line?
And despite evidence to the contrary, at this very moment, martinis are making a comeback at the Four Seasons.

HEADLINE: Sugar in the Everglades

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Master Plan for the Everglades" (editorial, July 2):
Conspicuously absent from the Clinton Administration's plan for the restoration of the Everglades is an end to price supports on sugar, which have aided sugar growers and corn sweetener manufacturers but have all but destroyed the Everglades and cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and higher food costs. 
 Price supports keep domestic sugar prices high, thereby making it profitable to grow sugar on less productive land.
Allowing prices to fall to the world market price would free marginal land now used for growing sugar and reduce the need to use chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides.

NORTHERN IRELAND: MITCHELL'S WARNING -- George J. Mitchell, the former U.S. Senator who was chairman of the talks that produced the April 1998 peace accord, told graduating students at Queens University in Belfast that it would be "an immense tragedy" if the agreement failed because of a dispute on guerrilla disarmament. Protestant politicians are resisting plans to start the new government on July 15 unless the I.R.A. begins turning in weapons first. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

FRANCE: PARIS SHRINKING -- A census carried out in March showed 58,416,500 people living in France, up from 56,615,000 in 1990, and another 1,665,500 in French overseas territories, the National Statistics and Economic Studies Institute said. Paris, with 2,115,757 within the city limits and nearly 11 million in the metropolitan area, shrunk by 1.7 percent. Craig R. Whitney (NYT)
 
FRANCE, MAURITANIA: MILITARY FREEZE -- French and Mauritanian authorities said military training programs between the two countries had been suspended after Mauritania protested a French decision to arrest a Mauritanian Army captain on human rights charges. Capt. Ely Ould Dah has been accused of abusing detainees in Mauritania in 1990 and 1991. Craig R. Whitney (NYT)
 
UKRAINE: PREMIER SURVIVES VOTE -- Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament, with 182 deputies voting for the Government's removal, less than the 226 votes needed in the 450-seat chamber. The Government, which came to power in 1997, has long been criticized by the leftist opposition for the country's economic plight. (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
SOMALIA: FAMINE THREATENS MILLION -- More than a million people are at risk of famine in southern Somalia as lack of rain and fighting between rival warlords wreck agricultural production, aid workers said. The Somalia Aid Coordination Body, an umbrella group of donor nations, U.N. agencies and aid groups, appealed in a report for $17.5 million from foreign donors. (Reuters)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: TALKS AT UNIVERSITY -- After 11 weeks of a strike by students at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the strikers and the administration have started talks to end the shutdown, although the two sides remain broadly divided. The administration, which already conceded the students' chief demand for the university to remain free of charge, insisted that the strike be lifted immediately. The students do not want to start substantive talks until Monday. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: STRIKE OVER VEHICLE TAX -- Thousands of truckers blocked highways and cut back on deliveries around much of the country to protest a new vehicle tax intended to raise $700 million to give public school teachers a $100 monthly raise. The cargo truck union says it will continue the work action indefinitely until the Government backs off the 1.5 percent tax on automobiles, trucks, boats, planes and motorcycles. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
PERU: A RIGHTS PULLOUT -- President Alberto Fujimori introduced a bill in Congress to withdraw Peru from the jurisdiction of a human rights court administered by the Organization of American States. The court has condemned Peru's prosecution of accused rebels in military courts administered by judges. The bill was quickly approved by a committee and is expected to win the backing of the full Congress. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
PAKISTAN: KASHMIR 'UNDERSTANDING' -- The army chief, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, said the military and the Government had a "complete understanding" about Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's promise to seek a withdrawal of Pakistani-backed forces from the Indian side of Kashmir. He said the Islamic militants would be asked to leave their bunkers, and, "It is to be seen what will be their reply." Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
CHINA: PROTEST ON PAPUAN TIES -- China protested a decision by Papua New Guinea to open diplomatic ties with Taiwan and suggested that it would sever relations if the Papuan Government did not reverse the decision. Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi called in the Papuan Ambassador to lodge a "strong protest," a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. (AP)
 
CHINA: U.S. SHIPS BARRED -- China has turned down requests for two U.S. warships to visit Hong Kong this month, a U.S. Consulate spokeswoman said. The refusal is in line with a ban announced after NATO planes bombed China's embassy in Belgrade on May 7. (Reuters)
 
MYANMAR: EUROPEANS ADDRESS RIGHTS -- A special European Union mission arrived for talks expected to focus on human rights and the military Government's bitter political standoff with the opposition led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The mission will attempt to re-establish a dialogue between the E.U. and the Government, frozen since 1996 over allegations of rights violations. (Agence France-Presse)
 
MALAYSIA: PLAN TO HEAD OFF FOREST FIRES -- Southeast Asian governments announced an urgent plan to try to prevent forest fires and avoid a repetition of the choking smog that shrouded the region two years ago. Environment officials from the Association of South East Asian Nations, meeting in Kuala Lumpur, said they had agreed on a coordinated campaign that would first be tested in Indonesia. (Reuters)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAQ: U.N. AIDE ORDERED OUT -- Iraq has ordered the expulsion of a New Zealand employee of a U.N. mine disposal program, accusing him of trying to damage crops by burying locust eggs, a Government spokesman said. The man was identified as Ian Broughton, who is in charge of disposing of hundreds of thousands of mines in Kurdish-dominated northern Iraq. (Reuters)
 
IRAQ: TURKS PRESS DRIVE -- Turkish troops backed by strike helicopters and fighter jets pushed into northern Iraq in pursuit of Kurd guerrillas loyal to Abdullah Ocalan, sentenced to death last week. Turkey says a military campaign has pushed Mr. Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party into Kurdish-held northern Iraq and Iran. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: The Amazing Vanishing Surplus

BYLINE: By David Frum; David Frum is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The United States Government has a very 90's problem. Although it is taking in vastly more revenue than it ever imagined possible (almost $2 trillion a year!) it is having surprising difficulty buying all the things it thinks it needs.
There's that new four-wheel-drive prescription drug program and the summertime excursion in Yugoslavia. The children ought to attend better schools, and the F-15's in the home-security system are sounding awfully wheezy. But after paying all the country's current expenses, there is barely anything left over, $99 billion in 1999, and we did promise we'd put it all into the retirement account. . . . 
 It's embarrassing to imagine what Grandpa Ike would have had to say about all this. His annual income never exceeded $100 billion, and yet he still managed to save democracy from Communism, build the Interstate System and pay down the national debt.
Fortunately, there's a plan to pay for it all, and in the trademark 90's style. Not with money in the bank -- who has that? -- but with the bonuses and options the Federal Government is expecting down the road, a total of $1 trillion in budget surpluses over the next 15 years. The Government may not have sufficient cash to restock the cellar with cruise missiles after firing off that batch in May, but as soon as those surpluses vest, it will be rich, rich, rich.
The trouble is, the surpluses are largely imaginary. President Clinton is exploiting the delusion of wealth to come to lure Americans into making commitments to major new programs -- including that new prescription drug Medicare benefit -- that the country cannot afford.
Most of the doubts about the surpluses have thus far focused on the sunny economic assumption they rest on: that growth will continue strong and steady until the year 2008 at about 2 1/2 percent a year, uninterrupted by any major recession. Yet what's really wobbly about the surpluses is not economic, but political.
The foundation of the surpluses is the 1997 budget deal, which vowed to impose squeaky tight controls on the growth of non-Social Security, non-Medicare, non-defense spending, or what Washingtonians call "discretionary domestic spending." This discretionary spending includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation, meat inspection, enforcement of immigration laws, disaster relief, aid to education and jaunts by the First Lady to New York State.
In other words, just about everything the Federal Government does other than pay pensions. The United States spent $285 billion on those items in 1998. The 1997 deal promises that it will spend no more than $316 billion in 2009, an 11 percent increase over 11 years.
How realistic is that promise? Well, over the previous 11 years, from 1987 to 1998, discretionary domestic spending jumped 75 percent. Congress is in effect saying that it will raise this spending over the next 11 years by almost 90 percent less than it raised it over the past 11 years. Factor in inflation and the promise becomes even more exacting. Congress will have to cut the F.B.I., meat inspection, aid to education, etc. by more than 20 percent in real dollars over the next 11 years.
You can already hear the squeaks of distress from Capitol Hill. Representative John Porter, the liberal Republican from Illinois who is chairman of the subcommittee that decides how much to spend on health and education, is demanding that the limit on his segment of the budget be raised. A menacing number of his colleagues support him.
If Mr. Porter and those who think like him prevail, the projected surpluses will dwindle away. Domestic spending will rise, and interest payments on the debt will fail to fall. Interest payments are now projected to tumble to $71 billion in 2009 from $243 billion in 1998 as the surpluses retire big chunks of the Federal debt. But if those surpluses dwindle, then the debt does not shrink so quickly, and interest payments stay high.
This whole game of 15-year economic forecasts has been a sham from beginning to end, intended to divert attention from facts to dreams. The facts are that the Federal Government cannot afford at anything like current rates of taxation to pay the pensions and health care expenses of the baby boom generation after it starts to retire in 2013. The facts are that there is not a lot of room to raise those current rates of taxation, which are already crushingly high: the 15 percent payroll tax and the 40 percent maximum rate of Federal income tax today gobble up a higher proportion of the national income than Federal taxes did during World War II.
Like a 90's paper millionaire getting ready to lock himself into a mortgage on a monster chateau on Lake Washington, President Clinton is proposing to lock the country into vast new spending commitments on the strength of a notional income source.
This is an irresponsible, even reckless distraction from the task that Mr. Clinton has repeatedly set himself: to salvage the already badly overextended Social Security and Medicare programs from their imminent crises. It is likewise a distraction from what ought to be the Republicans' top priority: reducing tax rates to something like peacetime levels.
It's time to blow the froth off the latte and make some prudent plans. Otherwise, the Government is going to find itself three or four years from now in the same jam as its citizens: pacing fretfully at 2 o'clock in the morning through a $100,000 kitchen renovation, wondering how on earth it talked itself into the delusion that it was going to finance its obligations with a big, soggy mass of Surplus.com shares.

Oil Price Up As OPEC's Cuts Seem to Hold

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil rose to a 19-month high yesterday, near $20 a barrel, on signs that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will adhere to its promised production cuts in the months ahead.
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil-producing nation and OPEC's most influential member, said on Monday that his country would stick with its output cuts. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates also said the output reductions should be maintained. OPEC is leading efforts among world producers to trim supply by more about 7 percent. 
 "OPEC has a new spirit now, there's a rebirth of the organization," said Marianne Kah, chief economist for Conoco Inc. "I don't see them turning the faucet back on, even though prices have improved."
Crude oil for August delivery rose 9 cents, to $19.78 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest price since November 1997. Prices rose as high as $20.08 in electronic trading before the floor opened. Oil has gained 66 percent this year.
In London, Brent crude oil for August delivery fell 8 cents, to $18.10 a barrel, on the International Petroleum Exchange. Brent surged 52 cents on Monday when United States markets were closed for the Fourth of July holiday.
OPEC made 94 percent of its pledged output cuts in June, up from a revised 90 percent in May.
Saudi Arabia is only one of several producing countries encouraging compliance with the pledges.
Ubayd Saif al-Nasiri, the United Arab Emirates oil minister, said that OPEC should not "exploit" the increase in oil prices by raising production.
Kuwait called on OPEC to maintain its high level of compliance with oil output cuts -- even though prices have surged this year -- because global demand for oil remained weak, the country's official news agency reported on Sunday.
And Russia, which is the world's third-biggest oil producer but is not a member of OPEC, said on Monday that it cut exports by 6 percent in compliance with its pledge.

HEADLINE: Democracy Sprouts in Ghana; Now for the Harvest

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana, July 2

 BODY:
"Messiah," declared the sign on a street corner here, above hand-painted portraits of Jesus Christ, Nelson Mandela, Bob Marley, President Clinton (beloved here for making Ghana his first stop on his visit to Africa last year) and this country's longtime leader, Jerry J. Rawlings.
If President Rawlings's portrait can be found on this street corner, as well as on other corners of this capital where street artists sell their works, it is evidence of the enduring appeal of the man who since 1981 has guided Ghana out of collapse and through two presidential elections. 
 That a framed photograph of the President can not be found in every small store in the country -- a common practice in many African nations where presidents have acquired their position through decidedly undemocratic means -- is perhaps further indication of Mr. Rawlings's genuine popularity.
"But," said Ben Smith, the artist who painted the "Messiah" portraits, "he's been too long on the seat. From the head of state down, everyone has to respect the Constitution."
Ghana's Constitution limits the President to two terms, and calls by even Mr. Rawlings's most fervent supporters to respect the law suggest that a democratic culture is taking root. Many African and Western officials see Ghana as a success story, a country that has steadily liberalized politically even as many of its neighbors have stumbled.
Next year in Ghana, if all goes according to plan, something will occur here that is rare on this continent: the President will step down and elections will produce a successor. But many opposition politicians and even members of Mr. Rawlings's party are complaining loudly that the President and his inner circle are maneuvering to insure that he remains the dominant force in the nation's politics.
Western officials and foreign donors, who made Ghana a model for free-market innovations in Africa over the years, are nervously watching whether their investments will pay off with a smooth transition. They will also closely watch the election-year spending by the Government, whose largesse in the last two elections derailed Ghana's economy.
"Certainly it is a country and a Government that have generally been moving in positive ways, both in terms of the economy and democratization," said an American official here. "But we continue to see democracy as an evolutionary process, and one generally fair and free election doesn't make a democracy. So that's why the 2000 elections will say a lot about democratization in Ghana."
When Mr. Rawlings, a former flight lieutenant, seized power in 1981, Ghana was suffering from economic collapse and millions of people had left the country in search of work. But under the guidance of international institutions like the World Bank, the economy became one of the most stable in the region. The country became the United States' largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa and Nigeria. Roads, electricity and drinking water reached millions more of the 18.5 million people.
Political liberalization followed. After he was elected President in 1992, in balloting that the opposition described as unfair, Mr. Rawlings was re-elected in 1996 in a vote that was considered fair by his opponents and by international observers. And in the last three years, a Parliament of several parties and a vigorous press have emerged.
But with the end of the Rawlings era in sight, his party, the National Democratic Congress, has sent signals that have led people to question whether the President is really ready to let go of power.
In the last year, party members have floated several ideas that appeared calculated to test the public's willingness to accept a direct or indirect continuation of a Rawlings rule. Amending the Constitution to permit Mr. Rawlings's tenure to be extended was suggested, followed by the idea that his wife, Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, already a powerful political figure, would be the party's presidential candidate.
What's more, after Mr. Rawlings eventually expressed support for his Vice President, John Evans Atta Mills, as his successor, many of the President's critics perceived the move as a way of retaining unofficial control. That belief deepened in December when his party formed a consultative committee and made Mr. Rawlings "lifelong" chairman.
The party has played down these developments, saying, for instance, that the committee chairmanship is strictly honorary. Huudu Yahaya, general secretary of the National Democratic Congress, said the President's opponents had merely seized on these issues to portray the party as increasingly authoritarian.
"The only thing he would need now is for his legacy to be sustained," Mr. Yahaya said of the democratization. "Rawlings has become an international statesman. He's made a lot of pledges outside. He would not want his pledges to go down, because other heads of states in other countries have asked us how this can be sustained."
But the President's critics, including those inside his own party, are not convinced.
After Mr. Rawlings announced his support for his Vice President, a group inside his party calling itself the Reform Movement criticized the inner circle, saying it was increasingly autocratic and corrupt. The group announced early this year that it was breaking away from the National Democratic Congress, and a few weeks ago took the legal steps to become a full-fledged party.
"Since last year, there has been enough information suggesting that the ruling clique is not really considering a full democratic handover," said Kyeretwie Opoku, general secretary of the Reform Movement.
But more significant than internal party wrangling is a growing democratic culture expressed through ordinary people or the press, a contrast with the "culture of silence" of the last decade.
"When the idea of extending incumbency through a Constitutional amendment was floated," said E. Gyimah-Boadi, a professor of political science at the University of Ghana, "it was shot down by the independent media, radio talk-shows and phone-ins. That to me gave hope that there was a political opening and, while we cannot take it for granted that progress will continue, that it was genuine."
Mr. Gyimah-Boadi is also executive director of the Center for Democracy and Development, a year-old nonprofit organization that receives funds from the Ford Foundation and is an example of the growing presence of civil watchdog groups.
In measuring democracy's deepening roots in Ghana, people like Mr. Gyimah-Boadi point to the evolution of the Parliament. After the disputed 1992 presidential election, opposition parties boycotted the Parliament, which became a one-party forum for the next four years. But since 1996, members of several parties have served in the legislature, free to criticize the executive branch and summon ministers for questioning.
The legislature, though, remained relatively weak. Kwadwo Baah-Wiredu, a legislator of the New Patriotic Front, the main opposition party, said members were not given the resources to work effectively. He has no staff and no office, he said.
"This is my office," Mr. Baah-Wiredu said, opening the trunk of his Peugeot, which contained blue and red folders, a cellular phone and a Palm Pilot.
Although all members can introduce bills, not one has ever done so. Instead, the Attorney General's office has introduced all legislation since 1996. So acquiring a role in policy making would be the next step for Parliament, Mr. Baah-Wiredu said.
Despite his criticisms, Mr. Baah-Wiredu added, "We are moving forward, there is no doubt about that."

HEADLINE: Global Sales of Computer Chips Grow 12%

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6

 BODY:
Worldwide sales of computer chips rose 12 percent in May from a year ago, led by surging sales in Asia and Japan, an industry trade group said today.
Sales rose to $11.3 billion in May from $10.1 billion in May 1998, the Semiconductor Industry Association said. Sales climbed less than 1 percent from $11.2 billion in April 1999. 
 Global sales of computer chips are expected to rise 12 percent this year, led by products used in phones and networks as well as the increasing popularity of the Internet.
Recovering economies in Asia and Japan are helping buoy industry sales.
"May's global sales numbers are a clear indication of the positive and solid growth of our industry," the association's president, George Scalise, said in a statement.
Sales in Asia rose 18 percent from a year ago, to $2.77 billion, while sales in Japan surged 15 percent, to $2.46 billion, the association said. Sales in the Americas region rose 11 percent, to $3.64 billion. Sales in Europe were up only 3.2 percent from a year ago, to $2.41 billion, and fell 2.8 percent from April 1999.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Yield Rises On30-Year Treasury To 6.03%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday, sending yields to their highest level in a week, as the Government and corporate borrowers prepared to sell at least $13 billion of debt.
"The Treasury market may have a problem" until the sales are over, said Christopher Sullivan, who invests $475 million in bonds for the United Nations Federal Credit Union. "I don't see much that can drive prices higher." 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 3/32, to 89 8/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.03 percent from 6.00 percent on Friday.
The Ford Motor Credit Company, the finance arm of the auto maker, said yesterday it would sell as much as $7.5 billion of debt just weeks after delaying the sale in late June.
The credit company plans to sell $1.5 billion to $2 billion of three-year floating-rate notes and $3 billion to $4 billion of five-year fixed-rate notes. Its parent will also sell $1.5 billion of 32-year fixed-rate bonds.
The Household Finance Corporation, Williams Communications Group and Sanwa Bank Ltd. are also preparing debt sales of $1 billion or more. Freddie Mac, the No. 2 provider of mortgage financing, is expected to sell $2 billion to $3 billion of notes, perhaps as early as this week. Corporate bonds draw demand from Treasuries by offering higher yields.
Many companies stayed out of the market last week as the Federal Reserve met and raised the overnight lending rate between banks by a quarter-point, to 5 percent. They rescheduled sales after the Fed removed its tilt toward higher rates, signaling it was not in a hurry to raise them again.
The Government is also selling $7 billion of nine-and-a-half-year inflation-indexed notes today, more competition for investors' dollars.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.840	97.680	High Rate	4.59%	4.59%	Coupon Yield	4.72%	4.77%	Low Rate	4.52%	4.54%	Median Rate	4.58%	4.58%	Total applied for	$32,948,058	$34,742,554	Accepted	$10,959,483	$12,168,429	Noncompetitive	$1,345,032	$1,341,638	
 
Both issues are dated July 8, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Oct. 7, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on Jan. 6, 2000.

HEADLINE: Republicans Backing Tax Break For the Care of Elderly Relatives

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
People who care for elderly relatives at home would get a new tax exemption under legislation that Republicans will include in a sweeping tax relief bill expected to begin moving through the House next week.
The proposal outlined today by Representative Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, would also allow people to take income tax deductions for premiums they pay for long-term care insurance. 
 "The need for long-term care in America is great and will only grow larger as the baby boomers start retiring," Mr. Archer, a Texas Republican, said.
The announcement puts the Republicans on the same footing as President Clinton in advocating changes in tax law to help people cope with the rising costs of old age.
Mr. Archer said the proposals would be part of the Ways and Means Committee's tax package, which in its current form would provide tax breaks estimated at $850 billion over 10 years. Mr. Clinton would probably veto a tax-cut bill of that size, but elements of the bill with strong bipartisan support could survive in a smaller measure expected this year.
Tax breaks for long-term care exist in current law, but most cannot be claimed unless the amounts exceed 7.5 percent of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income.
Nursing home care already costs an average of $50,000 a year, Ways and Means Committee figures show. Numbers of people needing long-term care begin increasing fast at age 85, and 20 percent of 85-year-olds already need it. Planners worry that in 2030, the 77 million baby boomers will start reaching 85.
The Republican plan would add a personal income tax exemption -- similar to exemptions for dependent children -- for people who provide long-term care to elderly relatives at home. The exemption this year would be $2,750, but the figure would change annually based on inflation.
Mr. Clinton proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care this year, but it would be phased out for married couples with adjusted gross incomes above $110,000 and $75,000 for singles. The Republican plan contains no such income limits.

HEADLINE: Clinton, in Poverty Tour, Focuses on Profits

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill., July 6

 BODY:
Nothing motivates business like the prospect of profits.
That is the fundamental message underlying President Clinton's tour of the nation's impoverished precincts this week. Government tax credits and loan guarantees are fine as far as they go, Mr. Clinton says at each stop, but corporations are not going to invest in the Kentucky highlands, the Mississippi Delta or poor East St. Louis without hope of a decent return. 
 Mr. Clinton drew attention to the opening of a new Walgreens drug store here in East St. Louis -- one of the first new retail businesses to open in this struggling Mississippi River town across from downtown St. Louis in 40 years -- as an example of a corporation taking advantage of the new markets available in the United States' poorest regions.
"Hey," Mr. Clinton told a crowd of several hundred in the parking lot of the Walgreens store as a thunderstorm threatened behind him, "there are business opportunities out here. If you have people who want to go to work and people with money to spend and they're both in the same place, it's a good place to invest."
"Government's not going to do it," Mr. Clinton continued. "Nobody's going to put money here if they think they're going to lose it."
That calculation animated Bank of America, which today announced the formation of a $500 million "catalyst fund" to make equity investments in businesses in poverty-ridden areas. The fund will buy stakes in inner-city and rural real estate projects, urban shopping malls, job-training facilities and other ventures that the bank hopes will have a cascading effect on the areas they serve, a bank official said.
"There's real money to be made in these markets," Cathy Bessant, Bank of America's president of community development, said in an interview today. "All businesses go where profits are easier, and we believe there are booming markets here, regardless of geography."
Ms. Bessant, who is traveling with Mr. Clinton, said that traditional lenders were reluctant to lend in distressed areas because of false perceptions of risk and the lack of established lending relationships with inner-city entrepreneurs.
The Bank of America fund is intended not only to make money for the bank's shareholders, but also to inspire other lenders and venture capital firms to help in the revitalization of areas starved for investment capital, she said.
The President's "new markets" proposal, if passed by Congress, would help protect Bank of America's investments against losses by providing tax credits for new businesses and Federal guarantees for matching loans to such enterprises.
"The goal is not to ask people to make charitable contributions," said Gene Sperling, the White House chief economic adviser, "but to make companies take a second look in our own backyard where there could be profitable business opportunities while also helping rebuild communities that have been left behind."
Mr. Clinton stopped in Clarksdale, Miss., in the Mississippi Delta before flying to East St. Louis late this afternoon. He walked through Clarksdale's desolate downtown and visited a small manufacturing plant recently rescued from bankruptcy.
"This is a good business opportunity here," Mr. Clinton said at a policy discussion at the factory, owned by the Waterfield Cabinet Company. "If we cannot fully develop the Delta now when we have the strongest economy in our lifetime, when will we ever get around to it?"
Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who is traveling with the President, released a report today on the untapped retail market of the nation's inner cities.
The report concludes that cities like East St. Louis, which have seen their retail bases evaporate over the last several decades, have more than $300 billion in pent-up retail demand, presenting an enormous opportunity for retailers like Walgreens.
With neighborhood stores shuttered, inner-city residents are driving to the suburbs to shop, buying by mail, or, in some cases, shopping over the Internet.
East St. Louis has seen a slight revival in the six years since a riverboat casino arrived here, docking along the grimy riverfront. The riverboat is second to the local hospital as the largest employer in East St. Louis and has brought 1,200 jobs and some spark to this predominately black city of 42,000 people, though the city is still one of the poorest in the nation.
"Now is the time to use Government to tap those markets," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. He said that Mr. Clinton waited this long to make a major push for inner-city and rural economic development because only now does he have the economic and political clout to pull it off. Also, the electronic revolution has changed the nature of business, making it possible to conduct all manner of commerce from virtually anywhere on the globe.
"He couldn't have done this six or seven years ago," Mr. Cuomo said of the President. "He has the economy at his back, he has credibility in his Government and business is more mobile. These high-tech guys can go anywhere. They don't need water. They don't need ports. They can move to Appalachia, they can move to East St. Louis, they can move to the Bronx."

Clinton to Take In Soccer
 EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill., July 6 (AP) -- President Clinton decided today to extend his seven-state trip across the country through the weekend so he can attend the women's World Cup soccer championship in California.
The undefeated American team faces China in the championship at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
Mr. Clinton attended a semifinal game last week outside Washington as the United States defeated Germany to advance to the finals.
The White House press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said the women's team had invited the President.
"I think, like all Americans, he's been caught up in their success and wants to be there personally to cheer them on," Mr. Lockhart said.

HEADLINE: U.S., Avoiding Castro, Relaxes Rules on Cuba

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is quietly moving to expand contacts between the United States and Cuba, pressing a modest opening that largely sidesteps President Fidel Castro's Government.
With a series of small steps -- some announced early this year and others that are being prepared -- the Administration is mainly seeking to ease the hardships of the Cuban people and to allow certain Americans to visit Cuba, open offices there and send money, food and medicine more freely. 
 In coming weeks, officials said, they will lift more restrictions on money transfers and travel and announce the start of direct charter flights between Havana and the New York metropolitan region and Los Angeles, in addition to those that now depart and land at Miami.
The moves have included a tentative new approach to the Cuban Government. On June 21 in Havana, United States and Cuban officials agreed to begin working somewhat more closely to combat a sharp rise in drug trafficking in and around the island, and they proposed other measures that American officials said could foster more cooperation.
The initiative falls well within the limits on American policy that were set in 1992 and 1996 by laws that stiffened the 37-year-old economic embargo on the island. Some new steps had been considered earlier but were scrapped in the outcry after Cuban fighters shot down two civilian planes in 1996, killing four Cuban-Americans who had planned to fly over Havana.
"There is a conscious decision in this Administration to do what needs to be done," a senior official said. Referring to Cuban-American opponents of Mr. Castro's Government, he added, "This is a policy that has been held hostage to interest groups for way too long."
Some officials said the Administration was already being pulled on Cuba policy between the legacy of President Clinton and the political aspirations of Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Clinton is said by aides to see Washington's approach to Cuba as archaic. Mr. Gore is described as highly aware of the considerable influence that Cuban-American voters may have in two pivotal states, Florida and New Jersey.
Yet other officials say however modest the recent measures, the shift is particularly significant because it reflects a widespread view in the Administration that the domestic politics of Cuba policy are changing in fundamental ways.
A decade after the cold war's end, Administration officials say they see the strength of conservative Cuban-American groups waning, while opposition to the embargo continues to grow among business people, farmers, religious groups and younger Cuban-Americans.
After years of waiting for some political opening in Cuba, American officials say, they are now determined to go forward even if Mr. Castro responds by cracking down on dissent, as he did soon after Washington announced measures in January to increase contact between the two countries.
The Cuban response has even encouraged some American proponents of a hard-line policy who say the so-called people-to-people initiative might help destabilize the Communist Government by empowering the few dissidents on the island.
For its part, the Administration sees the approach as a means of undercutting Cuba's argument that it is under siege by the United States. The new direction is also widely seen as a way to present a kinder American face to ordinary Cubans and, perhaps, to build a modicum of trust with younger Cuban officials who will become more important after the 72-year-old Mr. Castro passes from power.
The Administration's latest actions on Cuba recall the largely secret White House effort in late 1995 and early 1996. Officials said that initiative, which focused more directly on the Government, was approved by Mr. Clinton and managed by Samuel R. Berger, deputy national security adviser at the time. It started with a relaxation of travel and other restrictions in October 1995. But according to current and former officials, the Administration also choreographed a series of possible steps to ease American sanctions if Cuba continued to open up its economy and to promote a more cooperative relationship with the Cuban Government.
"We were trying to open the door -- to push it open if necessary -- and make it clear to the Cuban Government that if they walked through that door, nothing bad would happen to them," one former official involved in the planning said.
Then as now, officials said, collaboration in antinarcotics efforts was high on the agenda. In meetings with Cuban officials, United States officials raised the possibility of American law-enforcement training for Cuban police and border-guard officials, as well as the stationing of a representative of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Havana, officials said.
"Narcotics was going to be a vehicle to get to other things," another former official involved in that initiative said. "The real question was what the next step would be."
Other proposals included encouraging American nongovernmental groups like environmental and human rights advocates to work in Cuba, some collaboration with the Cuban Government on environmental issues and an exploration of how to initiate contacts abroad between military officers of the two countries.
Such efforts slammed to an abrupt halt in February 1996, when the planes carrying the Cuban-Americans were shot down. The next month, Congress passed the Helms-Burton law, codifying the embargo and adding sanctions. Mr. Clinton signed the legislation over the advice of some senior aides and later came surprisingly close to winning a majority of the Cuban-American vote in Dade County, Fla.
In recent months, the Treasury Department has begun to simplify the cumbersome procedures for travel to Cuba by Americans like researchers and athletes, aid workers and freelance journalists. Similar consideration is most likely to be extended soon to others like students, artists and representatives of religious groups.
In March, the Administration moved to streamline the sale and donation of medicines to Cuba, and next month, a Florida pharmaceutical company is to start shipping medicines to Cubans from benefactors in the United States.
Under Federal rules that will take effect this month, Cuban emigres and others will be able to send money to Cubans by Western Union, reducing the cost of transfers that have been handled by travel agencies and other small businesses. Americans can now send up to $300 to the island every three months, as long as the money does not go to senior Government or Communist Party officials.
How much advantage Americans will take of the new rules remains to be seen. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, Maria Ibanez, said travel to Cuba had steadily increased since the new regulations were issued in May. The expected addition of direct charter flights from New York and Los Angeles is intended to accommodate that rise.
Since baseball games in the spring between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national team, Washington has offered proposals for other sports events. Those plans have been set back, however, by differences over how to avoid generating revenue for the Cuban Government, a State Department official said.
But the Administration move last month to explore a more cooperative antidrug relationship with the Cuban Government has run into stronger opposition, mainly from a few members of Congress, who say the Cuban authorities are involved in the drug trade. Administration officials who have read a recent Central Intelligence Agency assessment of Cuba's role said it concluded, to the contrary, that although traffickers in the Caribbean might have bought the complicity of low-level Cuban officials, there was no evidence of high-level drug corruption.
Although some officials said the Administration's new approach was gaining momentum, others predicted that it would increasingly be filtered through Mr. Gore's Presidential campaign. Mr. Gore, the officials said, has taken a relatively hard line on Cuban policy in the past, playing a prominent role in the decision to suspend charter flights in 1994.
A spokesman for Mr. Gore, Tom Rosshirt, said the Vice President supported a policy of building contacts with the Cuban people while maintaining economic pressure on the Government. Mr. Rosshirt declined to comment on specific advice that Mr. Gore has given Mr. Clinton on Cuba.

HEADLINE: Worry Over Insurance Fraud Extends to Grave

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., July 2

 BODY:
Charles Holmes was sitting in his wheelchair in his double-wide mobile home when he heard the news that somebody up North had run off with the money from a half-dozen Southern insurance companies.
"At first it didn't register," Mr. Holmes said. "Then I said, 'Hey, I got a policy with those folks.' It was kind of a shock. I thought, 'This dude has gone and swindled off all the money and some of us are going to be left out in the cold.' " 
 Mr. Holmes, a former police officer in nearby Pearl, is one of the tens of thousands of policyholders in Mississippi and neighboring states wondering just how badly they are going to be hurt by a huge fraud that authorities say was pulled off by Martin R. Frankel, a reclusive money manager in Greenwich, Conn. Several hundred million dollars is missing from insurers controlled by Mr. Frankel, who Federal law enforcement officials say may have fled to Europe.
For years, Mr. Holmes and most of the others have made small monthly payments on policies worth a few thousand dollars to cover their burial costs. Regulators have assured them that their benefits will eventually be paid. But with the looted companies out of money, many are concerned.
"I prayed about it last night, and the church prayed for all the policyholders," said Kitty Ruth Lowry, a 62-year-old widow with two policies on herself and one on her son.
Even George Dale, the Insurance Commissioner in Mississippi, whose staff first discovered irregularities at Mr. Frankel's three companies in the state -- the Franklin Protective Life Insurance Company, the Family Guaranty Life Insurance Company and the First National Life Insurance Company of America -- betrays some reservations, saying he is "99 percent certain" that policyholders will be made whole.
Mr. Dale said he could think of nothing specific that might get in the way but that "nothing in life is certain."
Gordon Rusty Haydel, executive director of the Mississippi Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association, an industry group responsible for guaranteeing payment of insurance benefits, is preparing to put a levy on the more than 640 life insurers doing business in the state to make up the losses of the Frankel companies, which have been seized by regulators.
As many as 300 policyholders may have died in Mississippi since the three companies were seized in early May and stopped paying claims, Mr. Haydel said. But he and Mr. Dale said they knew of no burials delayed for lack of insurance money.
Most policies in Mississippi used to pay burial costs are sold through funeral homes, which have been honoring the policies.
"I'm guaranteeing my people, they won't lose," said Steve Holland, owner of Lee Memorial Funeral Home in Tupelo. "I know the state guaranty fund is ultimately going to pay. I'm trying to keep pandemonium and bedlam from breaking out with my customers.
"In many cases, I placed their money with Franklin Protective. So I feel bad. My customers feel bad. But I'm reassuring them that I'm not going to let them lose."
Sheila Gates, a former agent for Franklin Protective Life, said the funeral homes were usually better known than the insurers. Burial insurance salespeople, she said, often begin a pitch by saying, "I'm representing so and so funeral home."
Small policies intended to pay burial costs are sold in most states, including New York. But advocates for consumers generally advise against them, noting they can be up to 10 times as expensive as term insurance. They are popular with low-income people, featuring monthly payments often less than $20 for up to $5,000 of coverage.
Insurance with better rates rarely comes in such small amounts, and the bigger, more economically efficient policies require larger premiums, often paid annually, which many people find beyond their reach.
Companies specializing in burial insurance charge higher rates, experts say, because their costs are higher. Even though agents in Mississippi work out of funeral homes, they often sell policies door to door and some still personally make monthly collections. With few exceptions, like people who acknowledge they are infected with the AIDS virus, coverage is available to all comers.
"If a man can fog a mirror -- if he's breathing -- he can usually buy this kind of insurance," said Harland Dyer, actuary for the Mississippi Insurance Department.
In Mississippi and much of the South, burial insurance is a matter of culture, tradition and rock-bottom economics. People of modest means say they take special comfort in knowing that no matter how bad things get, they can always pay their final expenses.
"I don't want my kids to have to put out anything to bury me," said Van Robinson Kersh, who is retired from a box factory and now works part time at a funeral home.
For many, this is the only insurance they have, their ties to the insurers among the few constants in life.
"I could call and ask them anything and they would give me an answer," said Frances Thornell, a 70-year-old widow with two policies on herself from a Frankel company and several on her children and grandchildren. "I'm just speechless."
Regulators have advised policyholders to keep making their monthly payments so their policies do not lapse. But many find that difficult to accept.
"Would you want to pay on something if you didn't know for sure it was going to be there for you?" Mrs. Lowry asked.
Mary Phillips, a retired furniture factory worker, said that every month when she helps her 85-year-old mother send off her insurance check, her mother tells her: "Well, I can be buried for another month. You won't have to put me in a ditch."
Ms. Philips said she has kept the news of trouble at Franklin Protective from her mother. "It would be very, very stressful for her," she said.
James Jack Robinson, who has made a small fortune in the funeral home business and four and a half years ago sold the company now known as Franklin Protective to a trust that investigators say was controlled by Mr. Frankel, said customers are often not aware that they can get much more insurance for their money.
"Agents for the better-priced insurance don't go out and knock on doors," he said.
Yet many around here say they would never think of buying anything but burial insurance.
Mr. Holmes and his wife, Faye, who drives a pickup for a courier service, both have $5,000 policies that cost them $23 a month. Even if they could save up to make one annual payment for more coverage, Mr. Holmes said, they probably would not.
"I was raised on this kind of insurance," he said. "My father bought it. His father bought it."
"In a way," he said, "you overpay. But these low premiums are enticing to a person who's only got a certain amount of money coming in."
To people here, Martin Frankel, the man who apparently made a fortune by looting their companies, is a hard-to-imagine faraway demon. If he is ever caught, they say, life in prison would be too kind.
"I didn't realize anyone could be so cruel," said Mrs. Thornell, who struggles with respiratory problems. "He must not have any feelings at all. I'm sure there are a lot of people like me living on Social Security and just able to pay for the insurance. Then some idiot like this comes and destroys us. It just drains you."
Mr. Holmes said he would like to see Mr. Frankel face to face.
"A lot of people," he said, "would love to get hold of the old boy and shake him a little bit to see what kind of change fell out. But I guess it's best for the law to handle that."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: A Media World to Conquer;
In Europe, Giants Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
Europe's television industry is suddenly in the grip of an American-style consolidation.
Encouraged by the forces of the global economy and the power of the Internet, European media companies are forging cross-border links, and American giants like the Microsoft Corporation are buying into the action. The resulting corporate alliances are providing a gateway for advertisers to reach wider mass audiences and an opportunity for Europe to challenge America's supremacy in television programming. 
 The European television market was first opened up in the 1980's, as state broadcasting monopolies crumbled and commercial channels sprang up. Now the long-expected shakeout of an industry made up of dozens of struggling private and commercial channels has begun in earnest.
Europe, in fact, seems to be charging into a future very much like America's present, in which the TV industry is dominated by a handful of huge conglomerates. "It's a long road, and it will require a tremendous amount of money, but it will happen," said Marc Andre Feffer, deputy chairman and chief executive at Canal Plus in Paris.
The activity so far this year has been intense. A company in the Netherlands called United Pan-Europe Communications N.V. has been gobbling up cable companies across Europe and last month took a stake in SBS Broadcasting of Luxembourg, another innovator, to form a strategic alliance. In March, SBS acquired Central European Media Enterprises, a chain of TV and radio stations set up by Ronald S. Lauder in Central Europe after the fall of Communism. Last month, United Pan-Europe agreed to acquire Poland's leading provider of cable and satellite service and the fourth- and fifth-largest cable companies in France, lifting the number of its subscribers to 7.7 million in 10 European countries.
And Mediaset S.A., the Italian television company controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, an entrepreneur-turned-politician, and the Kirch Group of Germany announced a joint venture in March to market pay-per-view programming in four countries and handle Kirch's international film distribution and Mediaset's advertising sales.
Then, also in June, the French conglomerate Vivendi S.A. tightened its hold on Canal Plus, the French pay-per-view company, by taking over the French film production and distribution company, Pathe, that held a stake in Canal Plus. The gave rise to speculation that Canal Plus might revive discussions about cooperating with the News Corporation, owned by Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born media entrepreneur. Mr. Murdoch, who is pursuing the kind of television breakthrough in Europe that he has achieved in the United States with his Fox networks, acquired a stake in an Italian pay-for-view channel, Stream S.p.A., and a major chunk of German soccer rights through a small German affiliate, TeleMunchen, last month.
Mr. Murdoch, at a news conference in London last week, ruled out a merger between the News Corporation's B Sky B and Canal Plus but kept the door open for looser alliances in areas like film production and rights to sporting events.
What is causing this frenzy of reorganization? Mainly, the global economy, which is forcing Europe's relatively small players to join forces to cover the costs of switching to digital and pay-per-view TV and of marketing integrated bundles of television, telephone and Internet services.
"Several axes are evolving," said Nick Bertolotti, who follows the television business at J. P. Morgan in London. Describing the industry's state as "very unstable," he added, "Anything can happen."
American companies are a big part of the equation.
Pan-Europe Communications is controlled by the Denver-based investor group Unitedglobalcom. And, imitating the American drive into "bundled" telephone and Internet services, it has already provided 118,000 of its cable customers with phone service and more than 40,000 with Internet access.
Microsoft recently acquired a 7.8 percent stake in United Pan-Europe Communications as part of its effort to extend its reach into the European telecommunications revolution. "The rate of growth is moving very, very quickly," said Henrietta Hirst, a spokeswoman for United Pan-Europe in Amsterdam.
Microsoft has also taken stakes in leading cable companies in Britain and Portugal, while the longtime American television businessman Harry Evans Sloan has invested in SBS. American groups like Unitedglobalcom, which was known until recently as United International Holdings Inc., and Internet service providers like America Online Inc. are searching out European opportunities, as are providers of television programming, like the Walt Disney Company, that see the promise of larger markets for their products.
If much of this sounds like an echo of what is happening in the United States, it is also enhancing the local flavor of European television. European productions are hardly about to outstrip American programs as Europe's fare of choice, but the Europeans have reconquered prime time with home-grown quiz shows and soap operas. Last year, there were no American series and only 2 American feature films among the 10 most popular programs in Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
To be sure, off-prime time is still saturated with American products. Cable and pay per view now enable TV audiences to see hit films like "Titanic" within months of their release, and channels across Europe are showing reruns of "Little House on the Prairie," "Hogan's Heroes," "Cheers," "Golden Girls" and "Baywatch," dubbed into the local languages, as they have for years.
But the the sheer proliferation of new channels and technologies means more broadcast time for everybody. As a result, European production of both high-quality programs and knockoffs of American schlock, like a French version of "Baywatch" called "St.-Tropez," is making big inroads into American territory.
While Europe remains a checkerboard of small markets divided by culture and language, industry consolidation means that broadcasters have bigger, more efficient organizations to help them offer national programming. Thus, "the market is becoming more European," said Fedele Confalonieri, president of Mediaset. He said Mediaset's vision "is for many local broadcasters, as there are in the United States, united in large units, like CBS or ABC."
As an example of how this works, consider Mediaset's alliance with Kirch. Under it, the Germans focus on what they do best -- program production and trading of rights -- while Mediaset brings in expertise in advertising sales and program distribution. (Mediaset's parent company, Fininvest S.p.A., holds a stake in the European affiliate of the Blockbuster video chain.)
One of last year's most popular programs was "The Count of Monte Cristo," a $20 million, three-part miniseries produced jointly by Mediaset, Kirch and the leading commercial broadcaster in France, TF 1. And as Europe unifies, more and more companies are broadcasting the same commercial spots across the Continent, enabling Mediaset to sell air time in a multinational way. "The spots for McDonald's, Sony and Disney are the same in London, Paris and Milan," Mr. Confalonieri said.
European regulators are casting a wary eye on the deal-making, especially on agreements that concentrate a lot of power in a single entity. In April, for example, Britain blocked a plan by Mr. Murdoch to acquire the leading British soccer team, Manchester United, for $1 billion. And earlier, Italy limited the television soccer rights that any one broadcaster could control, thwarting a bid by Mr. Murdoch for most Italian professional soccer rights.
Although those attempts failed, they demonstrated Mr. Murdoch's faith in the power of sporting events to draw big television audiences. Indeed, the News Corporation has succeeded in acquiring broadcast rights to four of Italy's top soccer teams. And one of the attractions of Kirch as a partner for Mediaset was Kirch's $1.7 billion purchase earlier this year of the rights to broadcast the soccer World Cup in 2002 and 2006.
"At the end of the day, TV wants to drive ad revenues, which come from ratings," said Jose Violante, managing director of NBA Europe S.A., the marketing arm of the National Basketball Association in Paris. "And how do you get those ads? Sporting events."
As in the United States, pay-per-view TV companies, with cables that reach into millions of households, are drawing considerable investment in Europe, not least from American companies. Microsoft's decision to gather stakes in European cable television operators is based on the expectation they will require cash and technology to offer customers high-speed access to the Internet. In Italy, the Mediaset parent, Fininvest, has a deal with Excite Inc., America's second-largest Internet portal, while Bertelsmann in Germany is working similarly with America Online.
Georges Nahon, the head of Microsoft's Paris-based European Internet and telecommunications activities, said Microsoft focused on cable TV because of regulatory restrictions on the use of phone lines for Internet service. But the cable companies generally need both cash and technology, Mr. Nahon said, explaining Microsoft's policy of taking equity shares. Microsoft continues to search for cable partners, he said, and not necessarily as potential investment targets, but also as customers for software and services. "We are looking at companies that are very connected to high-speed data carriage," he said.
In the meantime, the television companies, while entrepreneurial, are not necessarily all moving at the speed of the Internet.
Mr. Confalonieri of Mediaset, while acknowledging that Internet access is part of the company's plans, said the immediate aims of the deal with Kirch were production, distribution and advertising sales. "The rest," he said, "is wishful thinking where tomorrow is a little blurred."

British Telecom Ordered To Open Network to Rivals
Already under pressure from rival telephone and cable operators, British Telecommunications, which controls about 85 percent of the "local loop" copper network used by home subscribers and small businesses, was ordered by regulators to upgrade its network and open it to competitors by July 2001.
The directive reflects the rapidly intensifying competition in Europe to offer high-speed Internet access and other broadband services. But it also highlights the difficult situation facing the former state monopoly: competition is likely to accelerate the growth of the high-speed market, but it could also reduce British Telecommunications' slice of it.

Bill Could Create New Type of Bank
Depending on what a Congressional conference committee does, legislation that would overhaul the nation's financial system could include a provision for wholesale banks, which would take only large deposits and do everything else a commercial bank does. C2.
 
Oil Prices Approach $20 a Barrel
Crude oil rose to a 19-month high, near $20 a barrel, on signs that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would adhere to its promised production cuts in the months ahead. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil-producing nation and OPEC's most influential member, said that his country would stick with its cuts. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates also said the output reductions should be maintained. C7.
 
Late Selloff Pushes Stocks Lower
An afternoon selloff pulled stock prices down from early gains. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.12 points, to 11,135.12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.10 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,388.12, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 4.24 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 2,736.78. C7.
 
Bond prices fell, sending yields to their highest level in a week. The yield on the 30-year issue rose to 6.03 percent from 6 percent. C7.
 
U.S. Sues Boeing Over Bias Inquiry
In an unusual legal tussle between the Government and its second-largest military contractor, the Department of Labor filed three lawsuits against Boeing, contending that the company was blocking its investigation of charges of racial discrimination. A17.
 
Death Casts Light on Frankel's Life
The death of a woman two years ago at the Greenwich, Conn., home of Martin R. Frankel provides an unusual insight into the life of Mr. Frankel, who is suspected of defrauding insurance companies in several states of hundreds of millions of dollars. B1.
 
Russian Businessmen Aid Charity
Although Russian businessmen are often vilified as exploiters and tax cheats, many are making significant contributions to nonprofit causes. The largest donation made by a Russian company or individual since 1917 came from Vladimir Potanin, who runs a financial-industrial group called Interros. He gave $1.4 million to support the reconstruction of the Rostral Columns, one of St. Petersburg's historic landmarks. C4.
 
Bathroom Humor Works for Film Ad
The advertising campaign for the film "Big Daddy," which shows two actors poised as if urinating, represents what may be the first time that a major Hollywood studio has sold a mainstream movie on the basis of a bodily function. But the ads have received almost universal acceptance by the media and few complaints. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. C6.
 
Russian Official to Head Company
Bowing to political pressure to reduce the role of foreign investors, the board of Russia's largest shipping company, Far Eastern Shipping, elected Aleksandr Lugovets, Russia's Deputy Transportation Minister, as chairman. C4.

Goodwill Games Headed for Bosnia?

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
The war in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 destroyed nearly all the athletic sites of the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.
The wooden seats from the Zetra arena were used for coffins. The bobsled run turned into trenches. The mountain site for Nordic skiing was transformed into a Serbian artillery position. The Olympic stadium became a graveyard. 
 But Sarajevo, which plans to bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics, is trying to jump-start its resurrection by persuading Turner Sports to take the Winter Goodwill Games to the city.
"The process of reconciliation in Bosnia needs a spur, something to show the people that we are capable of pulling together," said Muhamed Sacirbey, the Ambassador to the United Nations from Bosnia and Herzegovina. "There have been three great world events in Sarajevo: the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, the 1984 Olympics and the siege of Sarajevo. We prefer to be remembered for what the Olympics stand for: pluralism, tolerance and good will."
Sacirbey first discussed the Goodwill Games several months ago with Harvey Schiller, the president of Turner Sports. Mostly they discussed TNT's televising a figure skating event at the rebuilt Zetra, but the show was canceled because of NATO's bombing in Yugoslavia.
"We're excited," said Schiller, who visited with Bosnian Government and Olympic officials in Sarajevo last week. "But we've expressed our concerns with their ability to get it done. They've got rebuilding to do. The challenge lies with them."
Sacirbey admitted that his intense push for the 2001 Winter Goodwill Games will depend in part on the ability of Bosnia to attract public and private investors to build hotels and finance the continued reconstruction of the athletic sites. A deal with Turner, he said, may persuade private lenders and sponsors to make commitments.
"With private partners, they hear Bosnia, you think war, and why do you want to be there," he said. The athletic sites are in various states of repair, he said. The Zetra is ready. Some skiing has been restored. The speed-skating track is being rebuilt. Work is about to start on the ski-jumping facility. The bobsled and luge runs will not be resurrected.
Schiller is uncertain if Turner will commit to Sarajevo. Turner's first Winter Goodwill Games will take place in Lake Placid, N.Y., next year; to run two in consecutive years may not be plausible. Yet Schiller will consider it. A report on Sarajevo is due in September.
Sacirbey does not think a delay until 2002 is feasible because of the Winter Olympics that year in Salt Lake City. And 2003 seems too far away. "You want to maximize the benefits of this by doing it as soon as possible," he said.
Schiller said, "They'll need a lot of economic wherewithal to get it done."
Sacirbey would not rule out 2003. Bosnia is in no position to force anything. "We're looking to work as partners," he said. "We've had a good dialogue. No one wants to play hardball."
The allure of Sarajevo to Turner Sports, which staged the Goodwill Games in Moscow (1986) and St. Petersburg, Russia (1994), would be to reclaim the original peaceful intent behind the event. Ted Turner launched the games in 1986 after the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow and the Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles.
Last year, when the games came to New York City, their purpose was redefined to raising money for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and Unicef International.
 
Wimbledon Bidding
With Wimbledon over, so are NBC's and HBO's contracts to broadcast the tournament. NBC wants to continue, but HBO does not. ABC appears to be NBC's main rival, with ESPN, Fox Sports Net and the USA Network looking to replace HBO.
NBC is unlikely to bring in one of its cable units, MSNBC or CNBC, and would have to live with ESPN, Fox Sports Net or USA selling commercial time for the same event. (HBO carries no advertising.) NBC could team with Turner Sports, with which it is planning a football league, but it is not considered a strong possibility.
CBS is not likely to be in the fray because the All England Club would not be thrilled to have its Wimbledon jewel on the same network that carries the United States Open.
It's a good time for Wimbledon negotiations. The past weekend's ratings soared, because of the strong American showing and the placement of both singles finals on Sunday. The overnight Nielsen rating on Sunday leaped 40 percent to a 5.6. For the semifinals on Saturday, the rating jumped 48 percent.
 
A Woods-Duval Shortfall?
ABC might not show all 18 holes of the Aug. 2 Tiger Woods-David Duval prime-time (8 to 11 P.M., Eastern) match-play exhibition. The PGA Tour is insisting that the event begin at 7:30 P.M. Eastern (4:30 P.M. at the Sherwood Country Club in Los Angeles) to guarantee enough time to complete a round. ABC would join it in progress.
"The history of match play shows it takes between 3 hours and 20 minutes and 3:40," said Henry Hughes, the chief of operations for the PGA Tour.

HEADLINE: VOWING TO PURSUE PEACE WITH ARABS, BARAK TAKES OVER

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 6

 BODY:
Seven long weeks of political negotiations after he was elected, Ehud Barak took office as Prime Minister of Israel today and pledged that the pursuit of a "true, lasting peace" would be his foremost concern.
In a passionate inaugural speech, Mr. Barak, 57, addressed not only the Israelis glued to their radios and televisions but also the many Palestinians and Syrians who watched, waiting for messages. Despite a chorus of criticism against him for the composition of his Cabinet and some wariness about him in the region, Mr. Barak sounded a conciliatory note. 
 He reached out to all his domestic constituencies -- from high-tech workers to blue-collar unionists to soldiers' mothers "who don't sleep at night" -- as well as to each of Israel's neighbors.
Departing from the confrontational tone of Benjamin Netanyahu, his predecessor, Mr. Barak, the OneIsrael/Labor Party leader, told the Palestinians that he recognized their "suffering."
He spoke of the pain and death on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and suggested that each stop focusing on the "account settling of historical wrongs."
While Mr. Netanyahu always emphasized the dangers surrounding Israel, Mr. Barak described his country as "strong and confident." And he urged Israel's neighbors to meet him at the diplomatic table with an equal determination to ride the ups and downs of difficult negotiations.
"I call on all regional leaders to take our outstretched hands and build a peace of the brave," Mr. Barak said, embracing the phrase that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, often uses.
With a clear intent to allay the concerns of Palestinians that negotiations with Syria would take precedence, Mr. Barak said he would move forward on both peace tracks at once.
But, underscoring his keen interest in reopening talks with Syria, which controls much of Lebanon, Mr. Barak repeated his campaign promise to withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon within a year.
In Gaza tonight, Mr. Barak's words were received by Palestinians as a welcome break from the perceived hostility of Mr. Netanyahu, who officially quit the Parliament today, shaking hands and walking out with his back to the television cameras still pursuing him.
Still, Palestinian leaders, who are wary of Mr. Barak, expressed cautious optimism. "Barak's speech is an important and positive signal," said Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, the Speaker of the Palestinian legislature. "We hope his words will soon be followed by deeds."
Mr. Barak is expected to meet next week with Mr. Arafat before traveling to Washington in mid-July for his first official meeting with President Clinton. Mr. Barak is also expected to see President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan this month.
Using vivid language in his address, Mr. Barak, a highly decorated former general, described himself as a "warrior" who "for tens of years wore no other clothes but the olive uniform." Citing verses from the poet A. Hillel, he called himself one of the "gray soldiers whose hands are blackened from war and whose nostrils are filled with death."
"Our tongue is dry from the march," he quoted, "And we cry love into the insides of your souls."
After weeks of political negotiating behind closed doors, Mr. Barak re-emerged into the public eye this afternoon when he presented his Cabinet to the Parliament. Hours later, in a ceremony in the Israeli President's house, he was sworn in as the leader of a large majority coalition, controlling nearly two-thirds of the Parliament.
It was "no accident," he said in his inaugural speech, that he had taken almost all the 45 days allowed by law to form a Government now made up of seven very different political parties. "I was forced by the lessons of Jewish history and the deep divide within our people to form a Government that will be able to function during the most difficult times with the wide acceptance of the majority," he said.
From the lectern, as he spoke of inclusiveness, he faced down catcalls from Israeli Arab members of Parliament who feel unjustly excluded from his Cabinet. "How are you going to be the Prime Minister of everyone?" one shouted. "Where are the Arab ministers?"
Later, from another direction, Mr. Barak was rebuked by Ariel Sharon, the temporary leader of the opposition Likud Party, for not saying "one word" that would characterize the importance of the state as a "Zionist Jewish" enterprise.
Mr. Sharon, the former Foreign Minister, also criticized Mr. Barak for intransigence during the unsuccessful coalition negotiations with the Likud, and said that the "unique" personal relationship between them had been damaged.
Mr. Sharon said that he had requested and been denied the power to monitor the future peace negotiations, which, he said, in a reference to Mr. Barak, should not be controlled by only "one person no matter how talented he is."
Stinging news media criticism today labeled Mr. Barak as a leader with autocratic tendencies, calling him everything from "Caligulan" to a near "Ehud Bonaparte."
The criticism began after Mr. Barak unveiled his Cabinet. He was accused by many of making weak or inappropriate appointments. And many suggested that he was doing his best to consolidate his hold on power so that he could tackle his ambitious political agenda without interference.
In a country with a Parliament, it is unusual for the Prime Minister to act in a semi-presidential manner, but Mr. Barak, who was elected in a separate ballot from his party, says he has received a personal mandate.
"Barak promised fast economic growth, social justice, leaving Lebanon, completion of the peace accords, national reconciliation and security," Nahum Barnea, a senior political columnist, wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth. "Judging from the composition of the Government, it seems that he expects to carry out all of these tasks alone, with a commando knife between his teeth."
The new Prime Minister stared in the face his first political failure today when Avraham Burg, an ambitious Labor Party official and sometime critic of Mr. Barak, was sworn in as Speaker of the Parliament. Mr. Barak had backed a political novice for the post, only to have his own party choose Mr. Burg instead.
When Mr. Burg took his chair late this afternoon, he shook hands with the Prime Minister. "I have no hate in my heart toward the Prime Minister," he had said earlier in the day.
This afternoon, after presenting his Cabinet of 18 ministers, Mr. Barak said he would move immediately to alter the basic law of Israel. To accommodate the seven parties in his coalition and to take on tasks that are "humongous, maybe even historic," he said he would propose to expand the Cabinet to 24 ministers.
"And only one woman?" Tamar Gozansky, a member of Parliament from the Communist Party, called out.
Although he pledged to include at least three women in his Cabinet, he has appointed only one, Dalia Itzik of Labor, who will be Environment Minister, and no deputy ministers who are women. He has been roundly criticized for that.
Against the background noise of those charges, Mr. Barak nonetheless portrayed himself today as the leader of all sectors of Israeli society, a proponent of equal rights, and a healer.
He more or less apologized that Israel has "not always been wise enough to invest equally in all of its people." The remark was an echo of a legendary apology that Mr. Barak had earlier made to the Israeli Jews of Middle Eastern descent, on behalf of the Labor Party, whose original treatment of them is largely considered to have been discriminatory. He said he empathized with poor people who are "full of broken promises."
"We will change the national priorities," he said, promising to create 300,000 new jobs in the next four years and to invest heavily in education.
At one point, Mr. Barak addressed a personal remark to President Hafez Assad of Syria,
"We have been harsh and bitter enemies on the battlefield," he said. "Now it is time to form an open and brave peace that will insure the future and security of our peoples, our children and our grandchildren."
Mr. Barak also talked about working with Mr. Arafat to build a "true partnership in this land in which two peoples will live."
In a challenge to his intentions, bulldozers cleared land earlier in the day for a Jewish quarter in an Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem. The Palestinians have urged Mr. Barak to stop expansion of settlements on land whose fate will be negotiated, and the guidelines of Mr. Barak's Government promise to do that.
Haim Ramon, who was sworn in as a minister today, will oversee Jerusalem. He said that the project, Ras al-Amud, should be canceled.

HEADLINE: Albany Tells Nassau: Price of a Bailout Is Oversight by the Comptroller

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., July 6

 BODY:
Democrats in Albany today made clear their asking price for a bailout of the Nassau County government, whose Republican leaders have run up a deficit of more than $200 million: the State Comptroller, who also happens to be a Democrat, would be given sweeping powers to supervise the county's financial practices.
Hoping to speed up talks with the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, who is seeking legislative approval for a new 1 percent tax on real estate sales, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli released a draft bill today that would drastically change the way Mr. Gulotta runs the county. He would be required to issue a great many long-term financial plans, projections and reports that are customary for businesses and many governments but for the most part are unheard-of in Nassau. 
 More important, Mr. DiNapoli's proposal would force the County Executive to obtain Comptroller H. Carl McCall's approval for all budgets and bond issues -- a requirement that Mr. Gulotta is unlikely to accept willingly, officials involved in the negotiations said.
Still, the draft bill falls well short of assigning total control over the county's finances to an independent agency, as happened in the New York City fiscal crisis of 1975.
Mr. DiNapoli, of Great Neck, who is also the Nassau Democratic leader, said the draft summarizes the Assembly leadership's current negotiating position. "I really felt we needed to spell out, in very clear terms, what we meant by 'oversight with teeth,' " he said, using a phrase he has repeated often in recent weeks. "If they want to have a few less teeth than we're proposing, we're open to talking about it. But it has to be something real."
Attempts to reach Mr. Gulotta and other Republican officials were unsuccessful today after power failures here emptied a number of county offices. A spokesman for Mr. Gulotta did not respond to telephone messages left at the spokesman's home.
Mr. DiNapoli said that in his talks with Mr. Gulotta's lobbyist, Brian R. Meara, the county's willingness to accept financial oversight seemed to be in flux. Most recently, he said, Nassau seemed to back away from any kind of strict supervision.
"Given Nassau's history," Mr. DiNapoli said, "they weren't really dealing with the reality of the situation."
After years in which the county spent more than it raised in taxes, Nassau's yawning budget deficit last week caused Standard & Poor's, the bond-rating agency, to cut the county's credit rating to one category above that reserved for junk bonds. The budget problems stick out even more because of the county's economic prosperity, which in other municipalities has translated into record surpluses.
Here are some major components of the Democratic proposal, which draws heavily on a plan by Mr. McCall and Gov. George E. Pataki, announced last month, for an "early warning system" to identify and assist local governments in the early stages of fiscal stress:
*The County Executive would have to prepare a four-year financial plan with each year's budget. The Comptroller would then review both the plan and its revenue estimates. If they appeared unsound, relying too heavily on one-shot revenues or otherwise contributing to deficits, the Comptroller could reject the plan and, if the county failed to submit an acceptable plan, substitute his own.
*Proposed budgets would have to fall within the revenue and spending projections of the four-year financial plan. The County Executive would have discretion over how money is spent, but he could not exceed the plan's limits. The Comptroller could take the county to court to force it to bring its budgets into compliance.
*The County Executive would have to issue quarterly reports explaining any departures from projected revenues and expenses. If a deficit opened up, he would have to provide more documentation and submit a remedial plan to the Comptroller for approval.
*Before the county issued any bonds or notes, the Comptroller would have to comment publicly on the county's ability to pay off those debts. An unfavorable comment by the Comptroller would increase the county's borrowing costs, according to a member of the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee staff.
*A 15-member panel would review the county's finances, compensation packages for nonunion county workers and all personal service agreements with the county. Five members would be appointed each by the County Executive and the majority and minority leaders of the County Legislature.

HEADLINE: A HEAT WAVE SIZZLES: THE POWER;
Utility Officials Sweat Out a Record Demand

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Electric companies from here to Maine were stretched so thin today by demand from millions of air-conditioners that they breathed a sigh of relief when the weather broke, even though the break was in Michigan.
"It's good news; they'll have a little more to send us," said William J. Balet, executive director of the New York Power Pool, a consortium of the state's power generators and users that imports and exports power to and from utilities outside the state based on supply, demand and price. The pool also helps coordinate power production within the state. 
 Utilities in the eastern United States set records for demand today. Most of them were able to squeak through on supplies that they produced or imported, although electric companies in New York State and a broad area to the south cut voltage. In New York City tonight, all power was lost in Manhattan north of 155th Street, as well as on Long Island and in central New Jersey, mostly because the distribution lines and transformers overheated.
In all, hundreds of thousands of people lost power for at least part of the day.
The peaks in demand for electricity are getting ever higher, experts say, because all new commercial buildings and most new houses have air-conditioning, and owners of older houses are adding air-conditioning.
"People talk about how much better the economy is," said Ron Morano, a spokesman for General Public Utilities, in New Jersey. "People left their air-conditioners on for four consecutive days, day and night, and that contributed."
Many utilities called on customers to shut off nonessential appliances; the New England Power Pool avoided voltage cuts but asked the governors of the six New England states to appeal to the public for conservation.
In Washington, the Potomac Electric Power Company warned on its Web site that people should curtail consumption to prevent a "complete failure of the electric power grid." The notice warned, "This is a very serious situation," entirely in capital letters.
But Potomac Electric, like other utilities, made do with voltage reductions. Such cuts make electric motors run a bit slower and make the picture shrink slightly on computer and television screens, but generally do not hurt computers or other electric appliances. But when power is cut completely, computers can crash and data can be lost forever.
While people on the streets were breaking into a sweat, utility officials were doing the same indoors. About two dozen of them around eastern North America, including Mr. Balet in New York, held a conference call at 8 A.M., where they got the news of the weather break from their counterparts in Michigan. The officials also imported power from Ontario, Quebec and the Canadian Maritime Provinces, among other sources.
The conference call is a daily ritual on days like this when each power line, literally sagging as the heat makes it stretch, becomes a critical lifeline. The three major power pools in the Northeast all set records for demand today: the New York Power Pool, the New England Power Pool and the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, which covers most of Pennsylvania and all of New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia.
All reported having much less generating capacity in reserve than they are accustomed to. That left them vulnerable to "load shedding" (their preferred term for blackouts) if they lost a single big generating station or transmission line. All said that in areas where power was deregulated -- such as in the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland Interconnection area -- electricity was trading at a price 10 to 20 times higher than normal, near $1,000 a megawatt-hour.
So far, such extreme prices are a phenomenon of the wholesale market, but some energy economists think that they will make their way into pricing for factories and other big customers, to encourage them to close and send employees home on the hottest days, moderating the demand peaks and reducing the number of plants built to supply power only a few days a year. Already, many utilities offer big customers the option of getting lower prices for most of the year in exchange for allowing the power company to cut them off on days like today. And today, they were all shut down.
New York hit a peak load of 30,311 megawatts today, and it would have been higher but for a line of cooling thunderstorms upstate. The previous peak was 27,700 megawatts in July 1997.
New England set a record on June 28 of 21,810 megawatts, but broke it today, with 22,500 megawatts.
And the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland Interconnection supplied about 52,000 megawatts, up from 49,406 megawatts two years ago.

HEADLINE: Common Ground Elusive as Technology Have-Nots Meet Haves

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
FOR the average Internet user in the United States, life is a never-ending stream of dilemmas: Upgrade now or later. Order I.S.D.N. or wait for cable modem service to arrive. Buy the Palm V organizer or go with the one that connects to the Web. Check E-mail while on vacation or leave the laptop at home.
But a conference held here in June underscored a very different reality: in many corners of the world, there are dozens of developing countries where widespread access to the Internet -- of any kind -- remains a distant possibility. 
 While it is true that some of the earth's most remote places are now linked to the Net -- one recent addition is Bhutan, a small kingdom in the Himalayas, which inaugurated its first Internet link last month -- there are still no connections at all in Iraq, North Korea and a handful of African countries. In many countries that have Internet connections, Net access is concentrated in the largest cities and is prohibitively expensive when set against an individual's typical income. That expense largely restricts the use of the Internet to an elite, mostly made up of foreigners, government workers and business people. And in some cases, government censors put the Internet out of reach for most people in their countries.
The conference here, called INET 99, was the annual meeting of the Internet Society, a nonprofit group that coordinates Internet-related projects around the world and has the motto "Internet Is for Everyone." Each year, the group holds a three-day conference; previous locations have included Prague, Montreal, Geneva and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This year, 1,600 network administrators, academics and business people gathered at the gleaming, cavernous San Jose Convention Center in the heart of Silicon Valley. That backdrop accentuated the fast-paced, high-risk, moneyed world of high technology, a world very far away from the everyday experiences of the people attending from developing nations.
Many people at the conference, from places like Japan, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, were sophisticated Internet users, concerned with cutting-edge technical issues. But many others were from countries where Internet connections are available to only a privileged few.
"It created a sort of schizophrenia," said Will Foster, a research assistant at the University of Arizona in Tucson who attended the conference. "The presentations by Ebay and E*trade highlighted the tension between the go-go growth of Internet start-up companies in Silicon Valley and the realities of Internet connectivity in countries like Cameroon."
Each year, a workshop is held for a week preceding the conference; this year, 143 people from 66 developing nations attended. It is aimed at sending participants home with additional technical and administrative skills for running networks.
Those accepted for the workshop -- 570 people applied -- have basic technical skills. "They also have to have leverage within their organization, and the organization has to have leverage in the country -- for example, someone running networking for the major university in the country or within the P.T.T.," said George Sadowsky, the Internet Society's vice president for education, referring to the shorthand used for many countries' national telecommunications providers.
The demographics of the workshop shift each year, as telecommunications needs change across the world. The first workshop, in 1993, had a large contingent of Eastern Europeans. This year, more than half of the participants were from Africa, which accounted for about 13 percent of the world's population but just 1 percent of the world's Internet users as of the end of March, according to data from Mike Jensen, a consultant with the Association for Progressive Communications, a nonprofit group based in Johannesburg. Excluding South Africa (where 1 in every 177 people uses the Internet), for every 4,123 Africans, there is just 1 person who uses the Internet, according to Mr. Jensen's figures.
Wawa A. Ngenge, the national coordinator for the Sustainable Development Networking Program in Cameroon, said his country got its first Internet connection in 1997. Internet service providers there pay the national phone company $3,000 per month for a 64-kilobits-per-second line, which is not much faster than the fastest dial-up modem; such slow speeds are common in developing countries and mean that I.S.P. customers must put up with very slow speeds. Just 15,000 people out of 15 million have Internet access, all of it concentrated in the capital, Yaounde. Using the Internet costs about $3 per hour in Cameroon, a country where the average civil servant makes about $200 a month, Dr. Ngenge said.
One thing slowing the Internet's spread in developing countries is the fact that many governments there enjoy a telephone monopoly. Dr. Sadowsky said such governments feared that the Internet might reduce the revenue from international telephone calls and faxes. "Telecommunications rates are extraordinarily high," Dr. Sadowsky said. "In the worst case, the P.T.T. provides one-fifth of a country's G.N.P. Part of our work is in convincing countries that if you ignore the Internet, you'll keep your telephone revenues the same, but you'll pay in opportunity cost, in terms of economic and social development."
Once the main conference began, those who had attended the workshop found little use for the general sessions, many of which focused on state-of-the-art wireless communications, E-commerce, venture capital and the development of Internet II.
After a panelist at one session mentioned that 40 percent of all venture money was invested within a 40-mile radius of where he was sitting, a member of the audience asked about the prospects for venture capital investments in the developing world. "Remember, we're technology investors," the panelist answered politely.
"They're so far away from us," Dr. Ngenge said of conference participants from wealthier countries. "We're worrying about two different sets of problems."
One prominent set of problems is, of course, political. In Laos, for instance, the Communist government considers the Internet a destabilizing influence because of the free flow of information associated with the Web and keeps connections scarce, said Paula Uimonen, a Swedish researcher in Geneva who is studying the Internet in Laos and presented a paper at the conference. "It's obvious that it's a lack of political willingness," she said.
In some countries, users who can connect to the Internet sometimes find that access to certain sites is blocked, according to Human Rights Watch. The group said that some Mideast countries, for example, blocked access to political sites under the guise of protecting users from pornography.
Laos has had E-mail since late 1994, Ms. Uimonen said, and got its first I.S.P. last year. There are 1,000 Internet users, most of whom are foreigners. There are two cybercafes in the capital, Vientiane, but Laotians are not allowed in.
The connection of Myanmar, formerly Burma, to the Internet remains similarly tenuous. All modems must be registered with the government, which is run by the military, Dr. Sadowsky said. Neither Laos nor Myanmar had representatives at the conference.
Immigration policies can make it hard for people to get to the conference. Two Cubans were invited to participate in the workshop, but one was not given a visa and because of that, the other stayed home. A person from Sudan was registered for the conference and had a visa but was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in New York, then sent back to Sudan.
A 24-year-old network administrator from Hanoi named Tuan Bui Anh arrived in California without incident. He said Vietnam got its first Internet connection in late 1997. Before that, computer users could send E-mail but could not go out on the Web. Net Nam, the main I.S.P., and four other service providers have connections concentrated in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
E-commerce has yet to make an impression in places like Vietnam, where few people have credit cards. Following a keynote speech given by Meg Whitman, chief executive of the Ebay auction site, Mr. Tuan seemed a bit bewildered. "I think this is for the Americans only," he said.

HEADLINE: Addition to Consumers' Arsenal: net Complaint Services for Hire

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
GIVEN the service economy's hire-someone-else mentality, which leads some people to pay others to walk the dog and tutor the children in baseball, it is no wonder that you can now hire Internet businesses to complain on your behalf.
Sites like Complain.com and Fight Back promise to write letters, make phone calls and, if necessary, whine in exchange for a modest -- and sometimes not so modest -- fee. 
 "A lot of people have tried to handle problems themselves, but they're frustrated and angry," said Bill Tran, president of Caveat Emptor (www.cemptor.com), which went on line in March. "They want to forget about it," Mr. Tran said. "That's when I jump in."
One angry America Online customer, Elizabeth Huntington of Bradenton, Fla., failed to get an erroneous AOL charge canceled after three discussions with customer representatives over four weeks. "I don't think that business, especially AOL, takes me seriously," she said.
She turned up Caveat Emptor (www.cemptor.com) by searching for "complaint" on the Web. A week after Caveat Emptor sent a letter, AOL returned $48 to Ms. Huntington, along with a refund for a $50 bank overdraft fee. "When they got the letter from me through Caveat, then they took me seriously," Miss Huntington said. She wouldn't have got her money back without Caveat Emptor, she said.
Companies and clients say their specialized services are more effective than the efforts of a consumer working alone. "The reason the average person can't do this is that the average person does not have the kind of resources that we have," said David Horowitz, a consumer advocate who writes a "Fight Back" syndicated newspaper column and has a Web site at www.fightback.com.
With Americans buying and spending more than ever, the inevitable result is more services, products and goods to complain about. In addition, customer satisfaction with technology products may be declining in the face of rising product quality, creating a rich customer base for the professional complainers.
Some Web enterprises will complain for clients on a budget. The Consumer Complaint Resolution Company (www.complaintresolution .com) bills $29.95, or a 20 percent commission on the amount recovered. Fight Back will send out a letter personally signed by Mr. Horowitz for $25, a flat fee the company said covered administrative costs. Complain.com (www.complain.com) pleads a case for only $19.95. Caveat Emptor writes free complaint letters (but may start charging someday).
A number of these sites, like Fight Back and Caveat Emptor, also have complaint bulletin boards for posting complaints publicly. The goal is to give companies and agencies an incentive to shape up.
"This is a new way of handling it, where you can use the power of the Internet and the power of mass public exposure to resolve people's problems," Mr. Horowitz said.
Specialized expertise can carry a hefty price tag. Gary and Sandy Rattigan of Somerville, Mass., started Complain to Us in 1997 (www .complaintous.com). They charge $50 per hour (and a 30 percent commission when larger sums are recovered). They say they have an overall success rate of about 80 percent. Ellen Phillips of Alexandria, Va., gave up teaching English in middle school last year to turn all her attention to her business, Ellen's Poison Pen (www.ellenspoisonpen.com). She recently raised her rates to $30 per 100 words and $65 per hour. Clients spend an average of $400 for her services.
An Ellen's Poison Pen customer, Jamie Urick of Frankfort, Ill., explained, "If you have leg pain and you go to a physical therapist, you go to an expert -- it's the same thing." Mrs. Urick and her neighbors were frustrated that repeated pleas to state and county officials had resulted in no action against a noisy dirt bike track. Mrs. Phillips composed a biting letter whose recipients ranged from the county sheriff to the Governor of Illinois.
The sheriff replied immediately. Even though the case cost the complainers $240 and may still end up in court, the residents said the sharp, professional tone of the letter was worth it.

HEADLINE: Soul of the Eames Machine

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
NEARLY 50 years ago on a bluff in Pacific Palisades overlooking the Pacific, Charles and Ray Eames assembled their house and companion studio from prefabricated parts ordered off the shelf. The steel structure, prominently featured in an Eames exhibition currently at the Library of Congress, was hailed as the prototype for an industrially produced house that could yield a humane environment at minimal cost.
Today, the light-filled buildings still stand at the side of a meadow of rye, quintessential machines in the garden, built to show how industrialization could economically elevate living standards for everyone. The buildings embodied democracy. 
 The house was heroic in its idealism and global in its implications, but a big terra-cotta pot brimming with marguerites at the front door hints at another story. Flowers welcome visitors today, as they did when the Eameses lived there. Smaller pots with scented geraniums, lobelias, cyclamens, fuchsias and Mexican primroses line the front of the house, where the steel sash windows meet the gravel. The great house, built as a rigorous thesis with an ambitious social goal, has a soul.
The potted flowers surrounding the house were largely Ray's domain; she was "the esthetic conscience" of the office of Charles and Ray Eames, said their former associate Deborah Sussman, the Los Angeles graphic designer. "Ray sensed intuitively when art was present and when it wasn't, and that sense played a huge role in the Eames world," she added. "Everybody else, including Charles, knew she knew."
Though Charles got the lion's share of the credit for the creative work of the office, it was Ray, working with Charles out of a bathroom laboratory, who shaped the bewitching pretzels of plywood -- free-form sculpture molded in compound curves -- that would lend lilt to their Eames chair. (She died in 1988, 10 years to the day after her husband.)
In circuitous ways, Ray's flowers played a design role in the office. Trained as a painter with Hans Hofmann in New York, she had perfect pitch for color. Like nature, Ray abhorred a vacuum. Over the years, the clean-lined house on Chautauqua Boulevard acquired constellations of small things. A miniaturist, she gardened the interior with spoons, combs, vases and textiles. On her patios, she cultivated botanical humility, eschewing show-stoppers like orchids and lilies. She liked the intense orange-red-to-hot-red geranium flower's relationship to its green leaf. When she plucked dead leaves, she bowed straight from the waist, looking a little like a flower, herself. Her eye delighted in a detail like the square cut of a petal.
On a three-and-a-half-acre lot designed to look untamed, Ray planted the color. Her garden was pointillistic, composed of hundreds of dots that added up to the shifting color fields of a painter who preferred a small canvas. Over the years, with more and more pots, the patios filled in. What began as a spare carpet of space at the foot of the house and studio reached what Eames Demetrios, the Eameses' grandson, calls an ecological "climax community."
It was a collection that Tina Beebe, who worked beside Ray for years as a graphic artist, said "always harbored little surprises -- fraises de bois, Oxalis oregona." Ms. Beebe, a colorist associated with Moore Ruble Yudell, an architectural firm in Santa Monica, has cultivated a garden of Ray's favorites in Malibu, in remembrance of a woman who would appear at lunches with nosegays wrapped in moist swaddling.
"Ray taught me to love roses -- she gave me my first Belle of Portugal," Ms. Beebe said. "Ray liked flowers with little white faces, and singles rather than doubles. She didn't avoid a flower like tweedia because it was hard to grow. Her garden required a lot of work."
"She always traveled with scissors," Ms. Beebe continued. "Ray had an understanding with her neighbor Mrs. Bailey: any roses over the fence were fair game." She distributed them during the rest of her day.
She was a modernist with a subversive, almost Victorian, sensibility. "She'd give you these tiny, tiny little things carefully wrapped in wet cotton and wax paper," Ms. Sussman said. "Always this tiny little collage that was beautiful and exquisite, and meaningful to her and therefore to you. There would be forget-me-nots. Who has them now? The bouquets were never rigid: she worked them like a painter, pushing and pulling. Her understanding was in her cells."
She arranged the flowers on her tables at home and in the office in a perfect relationship. "She had as much depth and intensity of appreciation for that little petal, the ruffly petal of a rose, as she did for any designed object," said Elaine Sewell Jones, a fellow at the American Institute of Architecture and a close friend. "She loved scented flowers, and whenever we traveled, she almost always had a bouquet of gardenias or a clutch of lemon verbena. She often wore a Cecile Bruner rose, with that teeny, tiny bud."
Marilyn Neuhart, who contributed to "Eames Design: The Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames" (Harry N. Abrams, 1989) with her husband, John Neuhart, and Ray Eames, recalled her work habits. "The first thing Ray did after breakfast was to gather anything in bloom, and bring the flowers down to the office in a basket, along with lunch, and arrange them," she said.
Mr. Neuhart added: "The really wild thing was they used to go out to the west side of the office and picnic on a vacant lot. Charles and Ray would spread their blanket in all these weeds and debris, and she'd have a little thing of flowers, and she'd pull up her dress to sun her legs, and he'd take off his shirt."
Charles Eames recorded the world around him through his camera, including the world of flowers emanating from Ray's pots. In their film about the house, "House: After Five Years of Living" (1955), flowers fill the house like oxygen. The photographs -- there are 750,000 Eames stills at the Library of Congress -- constitute an implicit record of Ray's ecosystem of flowers approaching their climax state.
Flowers infiltrated the office's projects, too. Ms. Sussman opened a deck of the Eameses' building cards and discovered one of Ray's nosegays pictured -- daisies with a bit of a geranium, some violets and a little begonia -- "insignificant little things made art," Ms. Sussman said.
Ray's nosegays found their way onto the stock certificates of Herman Miller, the company that first produced Eames furniture. Flowers started appearing at Eames exhibitions. "She bought potted Easter lilies, and spread them at the base of the panels in the old I.B.M. galleries on Madison Avenue in New York," Mr. Neuhart said. "It took a certain curse off a temporary exhibition. It relieved the hard edges."
Bouquets even found their humanistic way into their multiscreen film "Glimpses of the U.S.A." (1959), shown in the Soviet Union at the exhibition made famous by the Nixon-Khrushchev kitchen debate. "In the 'U.S.A.' film, they didn't know how to end it," their grandson said. "Ray suggested an image of forget-me-nots, and they both knew it was right. And by one of those cosmic flukes, the flowers had the same name with the same meaning in Russian. So at the end of the film, the seven images merged into one picture of a bouquet of forget-me-nots, and everyone in Moscow choked up."
Ms. Sussman noted: "She made you see things differently by the way she put things together. Charles would sometimes conceptualize about whether a color should be bright or subdued, but he was conservative about color. It was one of her contributions to their work."
The Eames house is open on most weekdays, by appointment only; information: (310) 459-9663.

HEADLINE: MAKING WELFARE WORK;
Clinton's Cosmetic Poverty Tour

BYLINE: By Peter Edelman; Peter Edelman, a law professor at Georgetown, resigned as Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services to protest the 1996 welfare law.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As President Clinton travels across the country this week visiting poor areas, he should stop referring to them as "pockets" of poverty. It is not just a matter of pockets. Persistent poverty is endemic in cities and rural areas and is increasingly present, if less visibly so, in suburbs.
The President cannot admit the extent of the problem because his Administration has a vested interest in the notion that welfare reform has been a success. But welfare reform does not live up to the hype. The welfare rolls are down 40 percent, but poverty has been reduced only a little. Even in our hot economy, those who have just left welfare are, on balance, worse off. More people are working, but the increased earnings add up to less than the benefits lost. 
 Why?
* People are being pushed off the rolls all over the country. Many states drop people from the rolls for such derelictions as failing to come to the office for an appointment. Depending on the state, 30 to 50 percent of those who leave welfare don't find jobs. With the rolls down by more than six million people, this adds up to a big number.
* Many people who lose jobs can't get welfare. They come to the welfare office for assistance and are told to look for a job. This is called "diversion." To make matters worse, they are often not told they can get Medicaid and food stamps right away. Indeed, the food stamp rolls are down by more than a third -- much more than what can be attributed to the booming economy.
* Getting a job doesn't always mean steady work. Unemployment records across a number of states show that since early 1997, two-thirds of those who left welfare were unemployed for at least three months in the first year after they left the rolls.
* Too many jobs pay poorly, often because they are only part time. Moreover, two million people work full time all year and can't get their families out of poverty. More than 70 percent of poor children live in families where somebody has income from work. Lousy pay from work is the biggest source of poverty for people who aren't elderly.
And all of these problems hit minorities the hardest. We should remember that race is an underlying issue in the debate on poverty.
Some states are better, some are worse. Vermont, Maine and Rhode Island are really trying to help people get and keep jobs and protect children at the same time. Minnesota gives income assistance to those with low-paying jobs.
Idaho, on the other hand, has a two-year lifetime limit, with few exceptions, and throws the whole family off welfare for life after the third violation of its rules. In Mississippi, which has very tough policies and a weak economy in much of the state, the welfare rolls went down by 68 percent, but only 35 percent of those people found jobs. New York City and a number of states force women out of community college and into welfare programs that lead nowhere.
The bottom line: the poor are not better off. The number of extreme poor -- people trying to survive on an income of less than half the poverty line, or less than about $6,750 a year for a family of three -- actually went up to 14.6 million people in 1997 from 13.9 million in 1995. Among families headed by single mothers, the poorest 10 percent actually lost 15.2 percent of their income over the same two years.
Boosters of the new welfare law tout the decreases in child poverty the past couple of years. Child poverty is down slightly, but it ought to be down much more in this hot economy. One child in five is still poor, and we are a long way from the early 1970's, when one child in seven was poor, itself not a statistic to write home about. And the number of children in extreme poverty has increased.
States are sitting on large surpluses of unspent Federal welfare money while welfare-to-work needs -- child care, transportation, literacy, mental health services and drug and alcohol treatment -- continue to go unmet. If we want real welfare reform, we have to offer more. The needs are going to become more pressing. Nearly eight million people are still on the rolls, three million of them adults, mostly women. The Federal five-year time limit, one of the welfare law's harshest features, will start hitting them two years from now.
In fact, the real issue isn't welfare. It's poverty. And it's not just poverty, it's the situation of millions of people who don't earn enough to support their families. When you add up what it really costs to pay the rent, buy food, buy clothes, pay to get to work and all the rest, it's a whole lot more than what we call the poverty line. The vast majority of those getting the short end of the stick are doing the best they can and are not making it.
If there is a constructive side to the new welfare law, it is that it has helped many people see anew the challenges in making work into a reality for so many who were marooned by the old system. Perhaps now we can have a debate that goes beyond bumper stickers and sound bites. For openers, we should insist that Mr. Clinton's poverty tour be based on the real facts about the state of the poor in America.

If doctors win theright to organize, patients could lose.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
A CLOSELY divided American Medical Association, which represents about a third of the nation's physicians, has voted to form a union to represent its members in collective bargaining with health plans, hospitals and universities. The rise of managed care has shaken the cozy world of these high-paid, elite professionals. Now they are seeking cover from two groups they used to shun: unions and the Democratic Party, which is leading the charge in Congress to clamp down on corporate managed care.
But would unionization, as advanced by the association, be good for patients? No, say antitrust officials in the Clinton Administration and many independent economists. 
 Under current labor law, only salaried doctors can unionize. About 40,000 of these salaried physicians are already unionized. For the association to begin an aggressive unionization drive among salaried doctors breaks no new ground.
But the association also has something novel in mind. It plans to put its well-financed lobbying power behind a bill, sponsored by Representative Tom Campbell, Republican of California, and about 130 other members of the House, to change the nation's labor laws so that even independent doctors could join forces to negotiate fees and working conditions with health plans.
Mr. Campbell, a former professor of antitrust law at Stanford University, says his legislation responds to two "alarming anticonsumer trends -- the increased level of concentration among health insurers and the exclusionary contracting practices some have followed."
Large health plans make local physicians a take-it-or-leave-it offer, dictating their pay and the way they are allowed to practice medicine. Mr. Campbell wants to offset the power of the plans by creating a countervailing power: a physicians union. A strong union, he says, would give doctors more power to protect patients from denials of care by managed-care officials.
But Martin Gaynor, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says a union of independent physicians would be unwise. Under the Campbell bill, physicians would be allowed to fix prices and engage in other anticompetitive activities that would be illegal elsewhere in the economy. "A physicians' union will drive up health care costs, taking money from workers and putting it in the wallets of doctors," he says. Economists also worry that unionization of independent physicians will do something worse: severely limit the ability of managed-care plans to second-guess doctors who practice bad medicine.
Mr. Gaynor disputes Mr. Campbell's contention that creating a cartel of independent physicians would help patients even if, as Mr. Campbell assumes, managed-care plans wield monopoly power. But the fact is, he says, managed-care plans do not exert excessive market power. "For almost every major urban area in the United States, no H.M.O. accounts for more than 20 percent of the market" Mr. Gaynor says. "Many account for less than 10 percent."
He points out that there are no large profits that a physicians' union could strip from health plans without affecting patients. "Profit margins of typical managed-care plans were below 1 percent in 1995 and negative since then," he says.
"If a doctors' union jacks up fees," Mr. Gaynor adds, "it will force employers to pass along the added cost to workers as lower wages."
Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, fears a union of independent physicians will harm patients by giving doctors power to refuse to deal with managed care. That, he says, will drive out competition and drive up costs.
Besides, he says, the antitrust exemption Mr. Campbell and the A.M.A. seek is unnecessary. Antitrust guidelines, which he administers, already allow independent physicians to collaborate to help patients. They can join forces to discuss raising standards of care or to form networks that improve care by coordinating treatment.
At the core of the debate is patient care. After an exhaustive review of the research, Robert H. Brook, a professor of medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles, concludes that about a third of acute care provided by physicians was wrong or unnecessary, posing not only needless expense but also needless risk.
Managed care is a possible cure because physicians hired by the managed-care companies to review treatment by practicing physicians can correct errors, including rejecting inappropriate tests, treatments and surgeries. Mr. Campbell's bill allows doctors in a region to band together to block treatment review.
Mr. Gaynor acknowledges that there are problems with managed-care plans. Their quality is uneven, and their decisions can be craven. But, he says, "injecting a cartel of otherwise independent doctors is not the answer."
So what is? He suggests vigorous enforcement of antitrust rules against excessive mergers of health plans and carefully drafted patient-protection laws.

HEADLINE: Japanese Premier Is Off to Mend Fences (He Hopes) With China

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, July 8

 BODY:
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi leaves today for a major visit to China that aims to soothe relations between the great powers of East Asia and to improve the prospects of China's admission into the World Trade Organization by the end of the year.
No major breakthrough is expected. But officials are frantically negotiating market-opening arrangements in hopes of helping to work out a deal for China to enter the trade organization. That would be a major diplomatic triumph for Mr. Obuchi and lead to important opportunities and risks for China's economy. 
 Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China offered far-reaching trade concessions on his trip to the United States in the spring. But the White House did not focus on the issue and no deal was agreed on.
Then Washington publicized Mr. Zhu's offer, embarrassing him at home and provoking a backlash from Chinese industries that would suffer from foreign competition. Since then, it has been unclear whether Beijing would be willing to sweeten its offer or even keep it on the table.
Japanese officials declined to go into details of the negotiations, but suggested that China was being relatively flexible.
"The negotiation is going on in Beijing," a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Sadaaki Numata, said. "There has been some further progress in certain areas. But there are questions that remain."
In his two days in China, Mr. Obuchi will meet President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu, as well as Li Peng, the hard-liner who is head of the National People's Congress. Attention is expected to focus on security issues.
In particular, Japan will raise its concerns about North Korea's missile program and the prospect that North Korea will test a missile soon. Japan would like China to put pressure on North Korea to hold off on the launching. But China is not expected to agree. In any case, it is not clear that China has much leverage over North Korea.
Japan will also ask China to stop sending ships that intrude into disputed waters near the Senkaku islands, which are also claimed by China and Taiwan and which they call the Diaoyu chain.
China, on the other hand, is most likely to voice irritation at new Japanese-American defense guidelines that would give Japan a greater military role -- supporting American forces -- in any conflict in the region. China is apprehensive that the guidelines could be applied to Taiwan and that they signal a step toward greater Japanese military assertiveness.
Ties between China and Japan have been increasingly strained in the last few years, and a visit to Tokyo in November by President Jiang seemed to add to the strains. At every turn, Mr. Jiang vigorously raised the issue of Japan's invasion of China early in the century, and by the end of the visit both sides seemed soured on the other.
"The Obuchi visit should be used to halt the worsening in Japan-China relations," Nihon Keizai Shinbun, one of Japan's leading newspapers, urged in an editorial on Wednesday.
Mr. Obuchi has been trying to soothe the ill will, but the underlying problem is a deep mutual suspicion, partly rooted in Japanese brutality in China during World War II. Chinese complain that Japan has never properly apologized for the war and tries to deny its culpability. Japanese insist that they have apologized many times and that it is time to move on.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Despite Upward Rate Pressure, Key Gauges Set Records

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The three most popular stock market averages pushed to record closings yesterday despite upward pressure on interest rates and general disregard for shares of smaller companies, which fell.
The mixed performance was regarded optimistically by some analysts, while others contended that competition from the bond market would prove a drag on stocks in coming weeks. 
 "Given what we had," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities, referring to a 700-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial average from June 24 through Tuesday morning, "I think the action is very good." He added, "I think it's a sign of underlying strength."
But Steven Goldman, a strategist at Weeden & Company, fretted about the persistence of rate pressure as the Government auctioned $7 billion of inflation-indexed notes, and corporate issuers readied other big deals. "It's hard to be a pounding-the-table bull here," he said, predicting that rates were likely to offset the cheerful reading expected when the corporate earnings season reaches full stride next week.
"Everyone talks about how they are going to be terrific," Mr. Goldman added, "but that doesn't mean stock prices will do well."
A few companies, in fact, warned yesterday of lower profits, and their shares plunged. Waste Management dropped 19 5/8, to 33 15/16, after trading at a 52-week low of 31 1/16, barely half its May 4 peak of 60. New Era of Networks slid 24 5/8, to 19 7/16. On the other hand, after Yahoo, a technology bellwether, closed down 8 1/16, to 167 1/16, it announced second-quarter results that beat expectations.
On the strength of a late comeback, the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 52.24 points, or 0.47 of a percent, to a record 11,187.36, surpassing Friday's peak. General Electric, which won a huge jet engine order from Boeing, was the biggest factor, jumping 4, to 117 15/16. Caterpillar, up 2 13/16, to 62 1/8, and Allied Signal, up 2 1/8, to 63 7/8, placed second and third.
American Express, down 2 1/2, to 135 3/4, and Alcoa, down 2 3/8, to 61 3/8, were the Dow's biggest losers. They met profit forecasts -- Alcoa was even slightly above it -- but did not surpass them as some had hoped.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.74 points, to a record 1,395.86, paced by Microsoft, which climbed 2 3/4, to 92 5/16. A total of 268 index issues advanced, while 203 declined and 29 were unchanged.
The Nasdaq market, which is dominated by high-technology stocks, gained a modest 0.23 percent in rising 6.26 points, to its new high of 2,743.04.
But the record closings of the three main gauges masked softness elsewhere. For example, declines outnumbered advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,691 to 1,307, and the Russell 2000 and the Standard & Poor's 600, which include smaller companies, each fell by nearly 1 percent.
Drug, oil, retail and battered gold stocks turned in mixed performances yesterday, while airlines were mostly higher. Delta Air Lines gained 1 15/16, to 62 1/16, AMR 1 5/16, to 72 3/4, and U S Airways 7/8, to 46 5/16.
Volume on the Big Board expanded to a still-moderate 791 million shares; 93 issues reached new 52-week highs and 55 fell to new lows.
Major markets in the Asia and Europe eased by about half a percent, while prices climbed 0.6 percent in Brazil and 0.21 percent in Mexico.

Treasury Prices Fall
 By Bloomberg News
 Bond prices fell for a second session yesterday as the Government met lackluster demand in a $7 billion note sale and companies including the Ford Motor Company prepared to sell about $12 billion of debt.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 4/32, to 89 4/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.04 percent from 6.03 percent. Holders of 30-year bonds have lost 10.5 percent so far this year, reflecting price declines and reinvested interest.
Bonds fell as the Treasury's auction of 9.5-year inflation-indexed notes drew only tepid interest. Bidders submitted orders for just 2.10 times the amount of notes available. In the previous five auctions, investors bid for 3.11 times the amount for sale, on average.
Corporations, meanwhile, are competing for investor dollars. Companies have been lining up bond sales since the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by a quarter-point, to 5 percent, last week. The Household Finance Corporation issued $1 billion of seven-year notes, and Ford, the world's No. 2 auto maker, and its finance arm plan to sell as much as $7.5 billion of debt.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 9.5-year inflation-indexed notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 100.033
High Yield . . . 4.040%
Low Yield . . . 3.920%
Median Yield . . . 4.000%

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Clinton Restricts Imports of Brazilian Steel and Australian Lamb

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Despite a booming American economy, President Clinton moved today to restrict imports of two politically sensitive products -- steel from Brazil and lamb from Australia and New Zealand -- in response to complaints from unions and farmers that their livelihoods were threatened by a surge of under-priced imports.
Mr. Clinton has justified each of the moves as examples of how his Administration is enforcing dumping laws, a critical step, Administration officials say, to build support for open trade. But abroad, Mr. Clinton's decisions are viewed quite differently, as more evidence that the United States, while talking up the merits of free trade, is increasingly closing its borders to imports. 
 Mr. Clinton's actions today underscored how trade has become an increasingly sensitive political issue, even as the American economy continues to lead the rest of the world. The White House -- and particularly Vice President Al Gore, as he tries to invigorate his troubled Presidential campaign -- are coming under increasing pressure to aid workers and industries hurt by a surging American trade deficit.
Moreover, import restrictions have become part of a delicate dance for the Administration. It is arguing that the only way to build public support for a free-trade system is to demonstrate that Washington is ready to halt imports of goods that the Administration determines are "dumped" at unfairly low prices to be purchased by American consumers. While that may bolster the Administration at home, it is undercutting efforts to press other nations to open their markets, particularly agricultural markets. That will be the subject of a major new round of international trade negotiations, starting in November.
The action on Brazilian steel is part of a series of steps to respond to industry and union complaints about low-cost steel from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea and Russia. Under an arrangement negotiated with the Brazilian Government, Brazil's steel industry agreed to "voluntarily" reduce shipments to the United States, hours before a deadline that would have imposed tariffs of about 50 percent on its imports. Such "suspension agreements," so named because they suspend Commerce Department investigations into dumping, are also being sought with other nations accused of selling here at cut-rate prices.
Under the accord, Brazil will reduce shipments of hot-rolled steel by about 28 percent, and will export no more than 295,000 metric tons to the United States. The Brazilians also agreed to charge at least $327 a metric ton for their hot-rolled steel, a bit above the going rate in the United States. While the Administration defends such price-fixing as the only way to avoid dumping, it has previously responded with outrage when other countries, particularly Japan, have sought to set floors on the price of imported goods.
The agreement gives some protective cover to the Administration after the defeat two weeks ago in the Senate of a bill that would have set quotas on a wide range of steel products. The Administration had opposed that legislation, saying it was a violation of international trade accords. But tariffs to stop dumping and agreements like the one reached today are legal under most circumstances.
The lamb issue ranks low by economic measures -- but it is politically sensitive with both farmers and with New Zealand and Australia, not usual combatants in trade wars with America.
Mr. Clinton was acting on an International Trade Commission finding last April that a vast increase in the amount of lamb meat imported into the United States was harming the domestic industry. So today, in a proclamation, Mr. Clinton limited imports to 31,851 metric tons for the next year, starting on July 22. Any imports above that level will face a 40 percent tariff. Mr. Clinton said he would also offer roughly $100 million in aid to United States farmers over the next three years.
"The package of import relief and domestic assistance has been carefully crafted to help our lamb industry achieve sustained competitiveness," Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said in a statement released during the President's trip today to South Dakota.
The subject is bound to be a central topic of a visit next week by Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard. The trip is meant to celebrate the American-Australian alliance, and Australia's actions to sidestep the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis that began two years ago. But the lamb issue is a major one for Mr. Howard, particularly at a time when Australia's major markets in Asia are still hurting.

HEADLINE: The Rural Poor Need Democracy and Jobs;
A Backup Plan

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While most politicians would be resting on their economic laurels, President Clinton is touring the country's impoverished areas (news article, July 7). His idea -- encouraging private investment by offering tax incentives -- deserves a chance to work.
It is, however, an indirect method of providing job opportunities to those left behind. If entrepreneurs do not find the bait (the tax credit) tempting enough to offset the perceived investment risk, the President's program will fail. Thus, we need a backup. 
 If after a few years the "new markets" project fails to lower local unemployment rates significantly, the Government should engage in direct job creation by providing public service employment in these high-poverty areas. This way, even if the private sector fails to respond, these communities will still have a chance to join the rest of the country.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. to Seek Cut in Capital Gains Tax

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
House Republicans said today that they would seek to cut the top tax rate on long-term capital gains to 15 percent from 20 percent as part of the big tax-cutting bill they will take up next week in the face of opposition from President Clinton.
If enacted, the cut in the capital gains tax rate, which applies to profits on the sale of stock and other assets held for more than a year, would give a break to the growing legions of individual investors. And it could further fuel the long bull market on Wall Street, where stock prices hit another new high today. Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the capital gains tax cut would help keep the economy growing by stimulating additional savings and investment. 
 Mr. Archer's capital gains proposal will be one element of an $864 billion, 10-year tax-cutting plan that his committee is scheduled to vote on next week as the Republican-controlled Congress begins a politically charged showdown with Mr. Clinton over how to allocate trillions of dollars in projected Federal budget surpluses. The capital gains tax reduction would account for about $50 billion of the tax cut over a decade, Congressional aides said.
The top capital gains rate was last cut, to 20 percent from 28 percent, as part of the 1997 bipartisan tax and budget deal. Last year, Mr. Clinton signed legislation that reduced to one year from 18 months the period that stocks or other assets had to be held to qualify for the long-term rate.
Prospects for the further cut in capital gains are uncertain. The Administration attacked the plan today, partly on the ground that it favors the wealthy, who own the vast majority of stocks and bonds.
Moreover, Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee, is leaning against including a capital gains cut in the tax bill that he is drafting for the Senate to consider later this month. Mr. Roth favors other proposals to encourage savings and investment, including expanding Individual Retirement Accounts and the 401(k) retirement savings program.
But both Mr. Archer and Mr. Roth intend to include in their bills the first substantial broad-based reduction in personal income taxes since 1981. Mr. Roth appears to be settling on a plan that would increase the amount of income that would be subject to the lowest income tax rate of 15 percent. Mr. Archer has not divulged his approach.
Mr. Clinton has made it clear he will veto any tax cut of the size and shape that Mr. Archer is developing. But he has signaled his willingness to negotiate, and many Democrats and Republicans believe there is a good chance that the White House and Congress will work out a deal on taxes and other budget issues this year, in large part because the projected surpluses are so great that they can accommodate both parties' priorities.
While the House is bitterly divided along partisan lines over taxes, there is considerable support among Democrats in the Senate for a sizable tax cut this year.
"There are very large numbers of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate who want a tax cut and are prepared to meet in the middle," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, who has co-sponsored a bipartisan plan to cut taxes on the middle class.
Mr. Clinton has invited Congressional leaders to meet with him next week to discuss his proposal for shoring up Medicare, the health insurance system for the elderly and disabled, and Administration officials said they expected the session to range across the panoply of budget issues dividing the parties.
After some wrangling among Republicans about how large a tax cut to pursue this year, Mr. Archer agreed at a meeting on Friday with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert to put a price tag of $864 billion on the House's tax-cutting package over the next decade. The tax cuts would be phased in as the projected surpluses grow, with $5 billion available for tax cuts next year and $200 billion over the first five years, Mr. Archer said.
The $864 billion figure is an increase from the $778 billion earmarked by Republicans earlier this year for a tax cut, reflecting new estimates showing that the budget surplus will be larger than anticipated.
In the Senate, Mr. Roth is likely to limit his tax cut bill to no more than the original $778 billion to insure that there is money available for adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare, a goal shared by Mr. Clinton.
The Congressional Budget Office reported last week that the surplus over the next decade would be just under $2.9 trillion. Of that amount, $1.9 trillion would come from the Social Security system, money that both parties have agreed should go to shoring up the retirement system and not to tax cuts or general spending.
Democrats and Republicans are battling primarily over what to do with the other $996 billion, which represents a cumulative excess of general tax revenues for the next 10 years if spending is kept at current levels (a separate estimate by the White House put the figure at just over $1 trillion).
While Republicans want to use nearly all of the surplus for tax cuts, the President has proposed using about $250 billion over 10 years for tax breaks to encourage low- and middle-income families to save more for retirement. He wants to use most of the rest of the $1 trillion to help extend Medicare's solvency and to increase spending on education, child care, health care and the military.
Mr. Archer said that if his capital gains tax plan was signed into law, it would apply retroactively to all sales starting July 1 of this year.
Under the Archer plan, the capital gains tax rate for taxpayers in the 15 percent income tax bracket -- generally those considered low to middle income -- would decline to 7.5 percent from 10 percent.

HEADLINE: A Classic Success Story Gets a Nod From Clinton

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, July 7

 BODY:
When Josie Ippolito was 7 years old, she loved to get up at 3 A.M. to help her father make tortillas in their small family shop in this struggling section of south-central Phoenix.
"There was just something about it that was very exciting," Mrs. Ippolito recalled. "And then at 7 o'clock I'd come home and be dead-beat tired and have to go to school." 
 More than 30 years later, Mrs. Ippolito is still getting up early to help make tortillas, but now she is co-owner of the family business, La Canasta Mexican Food Products, whose factory makes about 840,000 corn and flour tortillas and tortilla chips in each 18-hour day, for sale to the restaurant business nationwide. And as she rushed around this morning preparing for a visit by President Clinton, then ducking out to have her hair done, Mrs. Ippolito could scarcely contain her excitement -- or her pride.
"We're here," she said, gesturing at the 25,000-square-foot factory, which the company built in 1994 with a $1.2 million loan from the Small Business Administration, nearly doubling its previous space. "We're making it."
Indeed, Mrs. Ippolito's business is a classic success story, chosen by the White House to hammer home the President's message about the benefits of Government and private sector investment in the pockets of urban and rural poverty that the booming national economy has passed by. Mrs. Ippolito, who owns the business with her mother and two of her sisters, is also part of a potent emerging demographic group here: businesses owned by minorities and women.
Since 1992, the Phoenix metropolitan area has ranked third among the nation's top 50 cities in the growth of businesses owned by women, going to 94,500 this year from 42,000, according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, and it ranked 15th in the nation in the overall number of businesses owned by women.
In 1996, the last year for which figures are available, there were 9,000 businesses in Phoenix owned by Hispanic women alone, employing 18,400 people and generating $1.6 billion in sales, according to the foundation, a nonprofit research group based in Silver Spring, Md.
When La Canasta emerged as the White House choice for Mr. Clinton's main stop today in this fast-growing city, some local Hispanic business leaders complained, said a former high-ranking local official who spoke on condition of anonymity. They thought a tortilla factory was a cliche, the official said, and wondered why the President did not visit one of the region's several Hispanic-owned companies like QuePasa.com, a booming Internet portal intended for Hispanic users.
But Mrs. Ippolito made no apologies for La Canasta's low-tech industrial processes, in which women still stretch flour tortillas by hand. "I'm very proud of the accomplishments we've made," Mrs. Ippolito said, noting that 60 percent of the company's 140 workers come from within three miles of the plant in a neighborhood that is part of a designated 19-square-mile "enterprise community" eligible for special Federal tax breaks. While the company does not disclose its annual sales, it is clearly thriving, preparing to expand into tortilla products to be sold in supermarkets.
This morning the start of a groaning buffet was already spread out for Mr. Clinton, who has long had a hard time resisting second helpings when it is Mexican day at the White House mess, and tonight, he took note of how many customers La Canasta's daily output serves.
"Eight-hundred forty-thousand a day!" the President said. "That's a lot of people, you know. Of course, not everybody eats as many at one sitting as I do."
Mrs. Ippolito may have begun her tortilla-making career as a childhood lark, but she joined the business full time at the death of her father in 1974. Her mother was left with seven children, and Mrs. Ippolito went to work in the business, which had started as a neighborhood tamale stand.
"It was just a matter of survival at that point," she said. "We all had to lock arms and go on."
Now, as the White House talks up its proposals of tax incentives for new businesses in depressed areas, Mrs. Ippolito wants the President to know that even existing small businesses need special help.
"We've been here 39 years," she said. "It's nice to bring in new businesses. However, you don't forget those businesses that have a proven track record."

HEADLINE: Trouble in the Backyard

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, July 7

 BODY:
More quickly than the political opponents of Slobodan Milosevic had dared hope, grass-roots dissatisfaction with the Yugoslav President is surfacing across much of Serbia.
Hostility toward Mr. Milosevic, bubbling up this week on the streets of the most unlikely of towns, has raised expectations among opposition politicians that Mr. Milosevic's survival in power might now be measured not in years, but in months. 
 What has particularly raised eyebrows among political analysts -- who are beginning to doubt that opposition parties are capable of harnessing the anger -- is the surprise eruption of large and violent protests in the southern Serbian city of Leskovac, a long-time stronghold of the Milosevic regime.
There, without the help of any political party, but with the participation of army reservists who fought in the lost war in Kosovo, more than 20,000 people marched on Monday night calling for Mr. Milosevic to resign. On Tuesday, about 2,000 people charged the local police station, demanding the release of the local television technician who had organized Monday's rally.
The police responded with tear gas and by beating demonstrators with nightsticks. The crowd retreated and later attacked the home of a local political boss who belongs to the Yugoslav Left, a hard-line Communist party headed by Mr. Milosevic's wife. They smashed windows in the house and destroyed its front gate, a police official there said by phone.
"If Milosevic is in trouble in Leskovac, then he is really in trouble," said Aleksa Djilas, a historian and political analyst in Belgrade who is not affiliated with the opposition groups trying to force the Yugoslav leader from office. "It is like a Kennedy being in trouble in Boston. This is the beginning of the end. I don't know when the end will happen, but it will be months, not years."
The presence of Yugoslav Army reservists in demonstrations in Leskovac is a wild-card element which, if repeated in towns and cities across Serbia, could tip the scales against Mr. Milosevic more quickly than opposition leaders had expected.
Since the end of the Kosovo war in early June, hundreds of reservists have intermittently blocked roads and bridges in central and southern Serbia, demanding their overdue pay for service during the 11-week war in Kosovo.
The survival skills of Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicted on war crimes charges, should not be underestimated. Although he has lost four wars this decade while presiding over the implosion of the economy, he remains a shrewd politician. He has weathered eruptions of mass unhappiness in Serbia before, most recently in the winter of 1996-97, when three months of daily demonstrations all but paralyzed Belgrade.
The two major tools in his survival kit are an enormous state police apparatus, which is still believed to be loyal, and state television, which is the primary source of information for most of the country.
There is a consensus among opposition leaders that Mr. Milosevic cannot afford politically to use his police to arrest, injure or kill large numbers of Serbs. As Zoran Djindjic, a key opposition leader, said at a rally on Tuesday night in the western Serbian town of Uzice, "If there are a lot of us, they will not use force."
Instead, they expect Mr. Milosevic to do what he has done in the past: deploy his police and his large party apparatus to harass, intimidate and try to buy off the opposition. For instance, to disrupt an opposition rally planned for Thursday night in Prokuplje, Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party has called its own rally at the same place and time. He tried the same tactic two years ago in Belgrade, without much success in igniting street violence.
That leaves television, which is doing what it has done so effectively throughout Mr. Milosevic's 12 years in power. It ignores or distorts all the news that is bad for Mr. Milosevic and his family, while vilifying their rivals and critics as corrupt anti-Serbian traitors.
There has been almost no television coverage, for instance, of this week's trouble in Leskovac or of three large opposition rallies in Serbia in the past week. But there has been plenty of television footage of Mr. Milosevic handing out medals to war heroes and promoting the image of a country on the mend. These moments have been private ones engineered for television rather than public appearances that might draw protesters.
As they have been for years, opposition leaders in Serbia are divided about how to best plug into popular discontent, which is rooted both in anger about the lost war in Kosovo and fear stirred by the collapsing economy.
The Serbian Renewal Movement, led by the charismatic Vuk Draskovic, had insisted since the war in Kosovo ended that the time was not right for street demonstrations. As recently as Monday, Mr. Draskovic told a news conference that he is a "legalist" who wants to press for reform from within the system.
The stunning news from Leskovac, which is controlled by Mr. Milosevic's Socialists but where the Serbian Renewal Movement is the main opposition group, appears to have forced the hand of Mr. Draskovic. His party announced today that it would take charge of a rally in Leskovac on Thursday night.
A senior adviser in the party, Ognjen Privbicevic, offered this explanation for Mr. Draskovic's sudden and seemingly opportunistic change of strategies.
"Vuk has such a good nose for these things," Mr. Privbicevic said. "Things are changing so quickly here. Nothing is predictable. This is the first rule."
Milan Bozic, the Deputy Mayor of Belgrade and a top leader in the Serbian Renewal Movement, said that all political parties in Serbia have underestimated both the depth of popular anti-Milosevic feeling and its power to bring people to the streets.
"All of sudden, it looks as though frustration over Milosevic is much more deeply embedded into the national consciousness than we expected," Mr. Bozic said.
Mr. Djindjic, a key leader of the Alliance for Change, a coalition of opposition groups, and a rival of Mr. Draskovic, delivered a rousing -- if vague -- speech on Tuesday that envisioned simultaneous daily rallies in towns across the country as well as a general strike.
Mr. Djindjic said he expected the Serbian Orthodox Church, which last month demanded that Mr. Milosevic resign and which has since been bitterly condemned on state television, will soon join the opposition and ring church bells across the country to call Serbs out on the nationwide general strike.
The timing and the planning for that strike are not yet clear, said Milan Protic, also a leader of the Alliance for Change. He said the opposition movement has not yet sat down with church leaders to ask for their help.
The Milosevic regime appears to fear the involvement of the church in politics. Politika, its main newspaper, today condemned church leaders for making peace in Kosovo with "terrorist" Albanian leaders and warned the church to avoid the "murky waters" of politics.

HEADLINE: 6 Are Killed in Ethnic Strife in Solomon Islands

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 7

 BODY:
The Solomon Islands, the group of tropical Pacific islands that witnessed some of World War II's most intensive battles, is once again the scene of strife, this time of its own making.
United Nations officials said today that at least six people had been killed and 15,000 to 20,000 people had been forced to flee their homes by ethnic conflict on Guadalcanal, the main island and scene of a major World War II battle. 
 Kevin M. Kennedy, chief of the Emergency Liaison Branch of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said the United Nations would support a mediation effort by the Commonwealth and would help the Red Cross provide food and housing to those displaced by the fighting.
Mr. Kennedy said that according to refugees, small bands of lightly armed militants belonging to the Gwale majority on Guadalcanal had already driven out most of the minority population of Malaitan villagers from the countryside. The Malaitas went to Gaudalcanal, often a generation or two ago, from the island of Malaita, 60 miles away.
Hundreds more Malaitas have been harassed or frightened into fleeing to the capital, Honiara, whose population is mostly Malaitan. Many are now sleeping on the streets, Mr. Kennedy said. Others have sought refuge with friends or relatives on Malaita, placing additional burdens on a population of mostly subsistence farmers and fishermen.
"These terrified people are unlikely to return to their homes any time soon," Mr. Kennedy said in an interview, "and certainly not until their safety can be assured."
The United Nations sent its mission in response to an appeal from Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, a Malaitan who is Prime Minister and who invited the Commonwealth to mediate the dispute. Sitiveni Rabuka, Fiji's former Prime Minister, has been trying to negotiate an end to the violence.
Occupying an area that is slightly smaller than Maryland with a population of about 440,000, the Solomon Islands, which gained independence from Britain in 1978, is a democracy known for its fractious Parliament.
Diplomats said that while the ethnic tensions among Guadalcanal residents goes back decades, fighting erupted last April when small gangs of jobless men began purging the Malaitans from their villages around Honiara Province. They were protesting what they saw as preferential employment treatment given Malaitans on the island, where about 115,000 people live.
After speaking to correspondents about the situation in the Solomon Islands, from which he has just returned, Mr. Kennedy was taken aback by a reporter who asked why the United Nations should spend time and money on a place where the death toll was "small potatoes" compared with the suffering in other parts of the world, like Africa and Kosovo.
"Well, it's not small potatoes to the people who've been driven out of their homes," Mr. Kennedy replied. "In the context of the country, which has not seen very much violence in recent decades, it's a major crisis."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Grand Designs Warrant Wary Looks

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
SOME of the world's most illustrious architects have grand designs for the 12 blocks between Pennsylvania Station and the Hudson River. Their schemes, unveiled last week at a competition sponsored by the Canadian Center for Architecture, call for parks and hotels, a riverfront stadium, a new Madison Square Garden and a glass-covered commons big enough to hold 90,000 people.
Those plans might sound like an improvement over the railyards now occupying that land. But before embarking on a new megaproject, it's worth recalling how some of the past ones turned out. Consider, for instance, an entry from the American Institute of Architects Guide to New York City for a project completed in 1970: 
 "Out in the middle of nowhere, on marshy land that was once the site of an ill-fated amusement park named Freedomland, a group of government officials, union representatives, and housing developers dreamed the impossible dream. Today the dream may better be described as a coma." That entry on Co-op City pronounced it bereft of "a scintilla of wit," a judgment that fits just about any megaproject in New York in the last half-century.
If they all suddenly disappeared, not many of them would be rebuilt. The sterile towers of the World Trade Center and the United Nations are not beloved by the public or architects. Few tears will be shed if the proposed demolition of Shea Stadium takes place. The Javits Center, billed as an urban renewal project, has had little impact on the surrounding neighborhood.
The comeback of Times Square might be considered a victory for urban planners, but it occurred only after the master plan was discarded to allow more haphazard development. Other renewal plans were just as bad. No one today would tear down hundreds of buildings on the West Side, as was so casually done by Robert Moses and the other planners who replaced them with mostly ugly high-rises and empty plazas.
Lincoln Center is in some ways a success, but the buildings have long been criticized for their acoustical flaws and architectural mediocrity. The Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall will never be as revered as Carnegie Hall is; the New York State Theater's rhinestones and intricate balcony railings give it the feel of the Ramada Inn of Seville.
"There's been lots of shoddy architecture in these big projects," said Norval White, a co-author of the American Institute of Architects' guide to the city. "You can point to some college campuses and parks like Jones Beach that are reasonably successful, but most of the big projects would never be done again. If you're looking for a great master plan done recently that works, I think Battery Park City would be about the only one."
Battery Park City, though, was a modest endeavor. Although it began as a megaproject -- the original designers were responsible for the elephantine Albany Mall -- it was scaled back into a re-creation of old neighborhoods like Tudor City.
Those old neighborhoods were not built by master planners. The street-front buildings were put up by many developers who followed simple zoning rules. It was only later that avant-garde architects and planners rewrote the regulations to promote the tower-in-the-park and other visions of urbanity that turned out so badly.
SO why trust today's avant-garde architects to make grand plans for the West Side? It's good of them to share their ideas, and maybe some of them will be built. But a new Robert Moses is not going to be warmly welcomed.
"The city will look at these new ideas for the West Side, but we're not necessarily going to settle for a unified megaproject," said Joseph B. Rose, director of the Department of City Planning. Mr. Rose, who was a juror for the competition, recently vowed to "drive a stake through the heart of tower-in-the-park zoning."
"The projects that have worked in New York," Mr. Rose said, "operate within the context of the market instead of trying to overcome it with some totalitarian vision. The old rules worked. The Zoning Resolution of 1916 produced some of the city's best neighborhoods."
It's hard to imagine going back to those times, but perhaps the railyards could be a special kind of historic district. Instead of drawing a master plan, sell off parcels to developers and exempt them from all housing and environmental regulations adopted since 1916. Granted, it would be risky. But could it turn out much worse than the projects we're already stuck with?

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Chief Joins Effort on Drug Insurance for Elderly

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 7

 BODY:
It may be the hot political issue of the moment in Washington, but from here, the Federal Government's rising debate over coverage of prescription drugs for the elderly looks a bit late, a bit leisurely.
The Massachusetts Legislature, dominated by Democrats, has been grappling with the issue for months, and this week Gov. Paul Cellucci, a Republican, jumped in with his own plan for a state-run insurance program that would offer a form of drug coverage to all the state's elderly citizens. 
 "We don't feel that we can wait for Federal action," said State Representative Harriette L. Chandler, the House chairwoman of the Legislature's Joint Committee on Health Care. "We have seniors who are in all forms of real crisis at this point. We have people who are cutting their prescriptions in half, we have people skipping days and people who haven't been filling prescriptions. They really do exist."
The urgency has grown out of unusual circumstance: Massachusetts had been the only state to require health maintenance organizations to offer elderly members the option of full prescription drug coverage. But that law was overturned in Federal court, and though the state's H.M.O.'s have been slowly phasing out the drug coverage, thousands of members already face problems paying for their medications.
But Massachusetts is not the only state that has long been pursuing a solutions to such drug costs. In recent years, 13 other states have passed various programs to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs, mainly focused on low-income people who do not qualify for Medicaid.
And in recent months, more than half the state legislatures have examined bills on the issue, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Proposals have ranged from drug discounts to adding people to state-subsidized programs.
All the talking crystallized here into two main proposals, one by the House of Representatives and one by the Senate. The two plans differed in dollar amounts and various provisions, though both would expand the pool of elderly eligible for state aid in buying their prescriptions as well as the amount of aid they could receive.
When Governor Cellucci announced his own plan on Tuesday, he called it a compromise between the House and Senate versions. But analysts say it entails not merely state subsidies but also a state-run insurance program that any elderly person could join.
For a premium of about $54 a month -- less or nothing for the poor -- enrollees would get unlimited coverage for prescription drugs, though with co-payments, and after paying a deductible of $750 a year for the elderly whose income is 150 percent of the Federal poverty level to $1,500 for those better off. The proposed co-payments would range from $8 to $35, depending on the type of drugs. There would also be an estimated 22 percent discount on all drugs.
The plan would begin in January and last either two years or until the Federal Government enacted its own drug coverage plan, whichever came first.
Governor Cellucci's plan appears to be generally drawing high marks, but not everywhere. Alan Sager, a Boston University health care economist, said today that making such a drug-coverage plan voluntary, as both Governor Cellucci's and President Clinton's proposals would, amounted to a financial "death sentence."
"You get into adverse selection," Mr. Sager said, "because prescription drugs are the single most predictable expense in health care." Thus, the sickest people are likely to enroll, he said, and the healthier people needed to make the plan financially viable are not.
Lawmakers also raised objections, including that it did not provide enough help for the disabled and moderately poor elderly. Questions also remain about whether the incentives it provides younger, healthier elderly people to sign up, like a planned 10 percent discount on their monthly premium, will be enough.
But over all, said Geoff Wilkinson, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, which has staged two drug-coverage rallies at the Statehouse here in recent months, "There's a lot to like about the Governor's plan."
"Congress would do well to take a look at what's going on here," Mr. Wilkinson said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Say Aid for Terrorists Came Through Two Persian Gulf Nations

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN with BENJAMIN WEISER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
United States officials say they believe that two suspected terrorists wanted by the F.B.I. have received help through two Persian Gulf countries with close ties to Washington, complicating the Administration's counterterrorism efforts.
Although the Clinton Administration has made no public protests, it quietly sent senior officials last week to one of the countries, the United Arab Emirates, to lobby for a halt to a suspected financial relationship between a Government-controlled bank and Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged in the bombings of United States embassies in Africa last year. 
 A Federal indictment charges that Mr. bin Laden's extensive businesses have provided him a cover to acquire explosives and weapons, and Washington has begun a worldwide effort to curb his access to international financial systems.
The Central Intelligence Agency has obtained evidence that Mr. bin Laden has been allowed to funnel money through the Dubai Islamic Bank in Dubai, which the United Arab Emirates Government effectively controls.
The Administration is also confronting allegations by some American officials that the Foreign Minister of Qatar told a suspected lieutenant of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, a convicted terrorist, that an F.B.I. counterterrorism team was on its way to Qatar to arrest him.
Some Administration officials said they did not believe that the Foreign Minister was involved in the 1996 incident, but that the United States believed that at least some Qatar officials had warned the fugitive, Khaled Shaikh Mohammad. The United States wanted him in connection with a plot to blow up 12 American airliners over the Pacific.
Both cases highlight the difficulties of managing relations with moderate Arab states long courted by Washington, showered with aid and allowed to buy high-technology military weapons.
The American generosity is meant to encourage the moderate states to stand as a bulwark against radical Islam, with public policies and with quiet support for American intelligence operations.
But analysts say some members of the elite even in moderate Arab states apparently feel a need to hedge their bets against critics of their pro-Western policies and to insure against becoming targets of terrorist attacks themselves.
The allegations that the Dubai Islamic Bank is dealing with Mr. bin Laden seem to underscore that this scion of one of Saudi Arabia's wealthiest families retains some support among the elite of the Arab world.
Although Mr. bin Laden was exiled and supposedly cut off by his family, which controls construction companies in Saudi Arabia, American officials believe wealthy Sunni Arabs in the Persian Gulf quietly share his anti-Western fundamentalist beliefs, even though they run counter to other moderate Arab interests.
United States intelligence officials said they had evidence that Mr. bin Laden had a relationship with the bank, which they believed had been arranged with the approval of the officials who control the bank.
The Minister of State for Finance and Industry for the Emirates, Mohammed Khalfan bin Kharbash, was elected chairman of the bank in February, after the Government stepped in to prop it up in the wake of severe financial losses last year that followed charges of embezzlement.
A senior United States official who went to the Emirates last week said that officials were "responsive" to American concerns about the Dubai bank's involvement with Mr. bin Laden. But the official refused to provide details about the meetings, which included Treasury Department and National Security Council officials. The American officials also declined to say how much money they believed that Mr. bin Laden had funneled through the bank.
Mr. bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban. Estimates of his wealth vary widely. Some analysts say they are convinced that he has just a few million dollars left from his vast inheritance. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that he has up to $250 million, including assets in legitimate businesses.
A press adviser in the Emirates Embassy here, Edmund Ghareeb, said he could not comment on the suspected bank dealings. The Qatar Ambassador to the United States, Saad Mohammed al-Kobasi, declined to comment on the allegations against officials in his country.
The Clinton Administration has refrained from public comment on either case, apparently fearing damage to relations with two oil-rich Arab states that have generally supported American policies in the region and that also help American military operations in the gulf.
For years, the main port of call for United States warships in the gulf was in the Emirates. Last year, the country agreed to pay $8 billion for F-16's fighters, a major boost for Lockheed Martin.
In Qatar, construction is under way on what United States officials say will be the Pentagon's largest prepositioning supply base outside the United States. When the $178 million complex is completed in about a year, it will support up to 10,000 troops and 5,000 vehicles, aiding operations against Iraq.
Since the gulf war, Qatar has also deepened its economic ties, cutting deals with American oil companies like Occidental Petroleum and Mobil. Breaking with its larger neighbor, Saudi Arabia, Qatar also became the first gulf state to establish open trade relations with Israel.
Its Foreign Minister, Sheik Hamed bin Jasim al Thani, plays a significant role in the relationship with Washington. He has met Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright two times recently, in November and February, officials said.
The Qatar case centers on efforts to arrest Mr. Mohammad in connection with Mr. Yousef's plot to destroy the airliners. Mr. Yousef was convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in Manhattan. In January 1996, the United States secretly indicted Mr. Mohammad as an accomplice in the airliner plot.
The indictment charged that in late 1994 and early 1995, Mr. Mohammad lived in Mr. Yousef's apartment in Manila, where they kept explosive devices and chemicals. Federal prosecutors have also said they believe Mr. Mohammad helped Mr. Yousef devise and finance the airliner plot.
In early 1996, American authorities learned that Mr. Mohammad was living in the capital of Qatar, Doha, and working at the Public Works Ministry, said one official.
The American Ambassador to Qatar, Patrick N. Theros, a former counterterrorism official in the State Department, met Qatar officials and reported that he was optimistic that Qatar would be willing to arrest Mr. Mohammad and turn him over to the United States, officials recounted.
There was a recent precedent such an action. About a year earlier, the United States sent a plane to Pakistan after the authorities there arrested Mr. Yousef and agreed to turn him over to the F.B.I.
The F.B.I., however, found itself thwarted in its attempt to catch Mr. Mohammad. Its agents, sent to Doha in early 1996, were told that the suspect, who had been under surveillance, was now nowhere to be found. A Qatar police search of a beachfront estate where the officers had been told that Mr. Mohammad was staying, proved fruitless.
The F.B.I. spent about a week awaiting word of Mr. Mohammad's whereabouts, they returned to the United States empty-handed.
American officials now say they believe that Mr. Mohammad was warned by someone in the Qatar Government and that he was staying at the estate of Abdallah bin Khalid, a fundamentalist who has provided support for other Islamic radicals. A former American intelligence official said Mr. bin Laden also visited Mr. bin Khalid in Qatar twice in the mid-1990's.
Although American officials said they had no conclusive proof, current and former officials said they believed that the Foreign Minister was involved, directly or indirectly.
The Foreign Minister declined to comment for this article.
American officials also noted that the raid occurred at a time of confusion in Qatar, which might have contributed to its failure. In the summer of 1995, the ruler of Qatar was overthrown by his son. In early 1996, about the time of the F.B.I. action, the father was staging an unsuccessful countercoup.
Two years after the fruitless F.B.I. action, Federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed the indictment against Mr. Mohammad. A $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction is being offered.

HEADLINE: The Rural Poor Need Democracy and Jobs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "A Pledge of Federal Help for the Economic Byways" (news article, July 6): Many local governments in Appalachia's poorest counties are corrupt, from the county commissions to boards of education. In central Appalachia, so the saying goes, "there are gavel judges and gravel judges." A vote often buys a load of gravel and political protection. A hundred years of external ownership and concentrated power have left the region's residents without the institutions they need. 
 Yes, the region still needs water and sewer systems. Health care centers are sparse. Schools are antiquated, and teachers' skills are outdated. The lack of jobs persists. But these issues pale in comparison with the need for truly democratic institutions. Programs that strengthen citizenship and participation are fundamental to real development.

HEADLINE: 200 Hear First Lady. Townspeople Were There, Too.

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: PINDARS CORNERS, N.Y., July 7

 BODY:
The likely candidate put it wryly.
"I'm really excited about being able to take these long, beautiful summer days," she said, looking out toward the gentle upstate farmland and probably the largest press corps ever to assemble for a United States Senate race, "and, you know, kind of at a leisurely pace with, you know, a few hundred of you." 
 The Schumer campaign was never like this. The Pataki, Cuomo and Koch campaigns were never like this. Even Hillary Rodham Clinton's husband, the President, didn't have as large a press entourage with him today as he traveled to a South Dakota Indian reservation in one of the poorest parts of the United States.
But then, the trip of a second-term President with 18 months left in office was no match for the historic and sometimes surreal spectacle of the first campaign-like day of the first First Lady to seek political office on her own, with her husband still in the White House.
By 9 A.M., four huge press buses had disgorged more than 200 reporters and television technicians from around the world on the farm of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who after 2000 will vacate the seat Mrs. Clinton is considering. Two days ago, bales of hay were cleared from one of Mr. Moynihan's fields to make way for an enormous press platform, more than 30 television cameras and 8 satellite dishes.
"When I woke up this morning and went out on the front step and saw the satellite trucks at the top of the hill," said Elizabeth Moynihan, the Senator's wife, "I felt like a character in 'The Invasion of . . . ' -- you know, one of those space alien movies."
Although this is Mrs. Clinton's 13th visit to New York since announcing her interest in the Senate seat earlier this year, the trip was the first to be paid for by her Senate exploratory committee and not the White House. Still, it seemed a strange hybrid of an official White House trip and a traditionally bumpy Senate campaign.
There was a White House-like press pool and a press center in Oneonta. And there were the typical trappings of a Senate campaign, with Clinton aides -- many of them former members of the Presidential staff -- volunteering their time, and complaining that the rented cell phones and beepers were not up to White House standards.
Howard Wolfson, the press secretary for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory committee, would not say what the trip was costing and how much money the committee, formed on Tuesday, had raised in the 24 hours of its existence. But he did offer that "you don't pay for these trips in cash." In past weeks, he said, Mrs. Clinton has made fund-raising calls from her residence in the White House, using either a cell phone or a line paid for by her exploratory committee.
The sight of the day was of Mr. Moynihan slowly walking Mrs. Clinton down the road from the one-room schoolhouse where he has written his 18 books toward the gantlet of press in his field.
The Clintons and Moynihans have had a sometimes difficult relationship in Washington -- particularly when the Senator criticized portions of the Clinton health care plan during the President's first term. But this time it seemed as if the Senator could be giving away a bride, or at least sending Mrs. Clinton off on her journey across New York, a state she has never lived in.
When the two reached the press, under brilliant sunshine and cooled by the first breezes in days, Mr. Moynihan introduced the First Lady, and said simply: "I'm here to say that I hope she will go all the way. I mean to go all the way with her."
Then New York's senior Senator took on the job of refereeing questions from the press directed at the First Lady. When Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV asked about Mrs. Clinton's "chutzpah" in running for Senate, Mr. Moynihan said: "Now, Gabe, we're in Delaware County. What was this word?"
For many foreign reporters, the word chutzpah was as new as covering a local American political race. Yoichi Kato, a Washington correspondent for The Asahi Shimbun, one of the largest daily newspapers in Japan, said that as far as he knew, it was the first time his newspaper had covered a United States Senate campaign, although he could not vouch for what had happened in 1964, when Robert F. Kennedy ran for the Senate in New York.
Japanese women, he said, are fascinated by Mrs. Clinton, because they believe that a typical American woman would have divorced her husband if he had had a relationship like the one Bill Clinton had with Monica S. Lewinsky. "She decided to put up with it without making too much fuss about it," Mr. Kato said. "That made Japanese people very curious about what she is up to."
Martin J. Kettle, a correspondent for The Guardian, said that the interest of the British public in Mrs. Clinton is "completely nonpolitical" and based on celebrity and scandal. "If Barbara Bush had decided to run, we wouldn't be here," he said.
Mrs. Clinton is "a sort of Lady Diana figure, the victim in a troubled marriage looking to live life on her own terms," Mr. Kettle said. "That appeals to a lot of people."
And also, apparently, to the American press. At the first "listening" event of what Mrs. Clinton is calling her summer listening tour of New York, most of the television cameras slowly slipped out of a conference room at the SUNY college campus at Oneonta as Mrs. Clinton listened to more than an hour and a half of local citizens complaining about the education system, lack of high-speed Internet access and, at one point, the manners of young people.
But the Oneonta citizens were also impressed by the media intensity. "We should be historically recording these cameras for our purposes," said Margaret Maguire, an associate professor of economics and business at Oneonta, staring at the television crews crowding two sides of the room. "I've never seen anything like it."

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Begins Pre-Campaign in a New Role for Her

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: PINDARS CORNERS, N.Y., July 7

 BODY:
The First Lady of the United States flew into New York on an Air Force jet today and presented herself as a potential candidate to replace Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan upon his retirement. Standing at Mr. Moynihan's side at his farm here, Hillary Rodham Clinton described questions about her residency as legitimate and said she would attempt to address them in the months ahead.
"It's a very fair question and I fully understand people raising it," Mrs. Clinton said at an appearance here that was part news conference and part political spectacle. "I think I have some real work to do to get out and listen and learn from the people of New York and demonstrate that what I'm for is maybe as important -- if not more important -- than where I'm from." 
 Mrs. Clinton then plunged into her first day on the campaign trail for herself, as opposed to being the candidate's spouse. She visited the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, ate lunch at a barbecue restaurant in Oneonta, and savored the generally large and enthusiastic crowds who turned out to catch sight of the First Lady and her entourage at every stop. She also held the first of the orchestrated "Listening to New Yorkers" forums that are to anchor her schedule this summer, listening intently and taking notes during a long discussion about education.
It was, by any measure, a remarkable day in the politics of both New York and the nation. It began at 11 A.M., when Mr. Moynihan, who is 72, slowly escorted Mrs. Clinton up the road from the old schoolhouse on his property that serves as his office, to a huge assemblage of reporters.
As the center of the kind of attention that is unheard of in a race for the United States Senate -- or even in the early days of a race for President -- Mrs. Clinton began molding a new public image for herself. With each of her eight answers at the 10-minute press conference, and then in stops throughout the day, she stepped away from the role of political wife that she had filled since Bill Clinton was elected Attorney General of Arkansas in 1976, and began filling in the contours of her own potential candidacy.
Mrs. Clinton rarely mentioned her husband, whose term ends in January 2001, and the President was not at her side, choosing to visit an Indian reservation in South Dakota. The First Lady presented herself as someone ready to learn about a state she has never lived in. She also for the first time offered some hint of dealing with the more difficult questions her aides expect ahead, from unresolved questions from Whitewater, to why she may, after seven tumultuous years in the White House, seek to become the first First Lady in the nation's history to run for public office. The leading Republican candidate likely to run against her is Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"I intend to be spending my time in the next days and weeks and months listening to New Yorkers," Mrs. Clinton said. "Now I suppose the question on everybody's mind is, 'Why the Senate and why New York and why me?' All I can say is I care deeply about the issues that are important in this state, that I've already been learning about and hearing about."
She added: "I would be, if I run and am honored to be elected, a strong and effective advocate on the part of the people of New York. I'm very excited about this."
The place where Mrs. Clinton headed first -- Mr. Moynihan's 900-acre farm, in this one-traffic-light hamlet 70 miles west of Albany -- was a curious choice. Of all the Democratic Senators in Washington, Mr. Moynihan often had the most unsettled relations with the Clintons. He was particularly critical of portions of the health care plan that was promoted by Mrs. Clinton during her husband's first term, and Mr. Clinton's aides frequently complained then that Mr. Moynihan was not helping Mr. Clinton accomplish his agenda.
But Mr. Moynihan and Mrs. Clinton share a senior political adviser, Mandy Grunwald, and Ms. Grunwald sat in with them in their private 25-minute meeting before their news conference. Mrs. Clinton has, over the last few months, repeatedly visited Mr. Moynihan's home in Washington to discuss the potential race, effectively recruiting him as her most prominent supporter.
As a jaunty Mr. Moynihan walked her to the microphone -- a moment suffused with generational symbolism -- he left no doubt about who he wanted to succeed him. But he almost neglected to say that as he turned over the platform to his guest.
"My God, I almost forgot," Mr. Moynihan exclaimed, then added: "Yesterday, Hillary Clinton established an exploratory committee with regards to a candidacy for the Senate, the United States Senate from New York, a seat which I will vacate in a year and a half. I'm here to say that I hope she will go all the way. I mean to go all the way with her. I think she's going to win."
Mrs. Clinton was assured if self-effacing throughout the day, taking the guidance of her advisers, who have been concerned that she may have projected something of an air of entitlement in past discussions about the seat. She seemed also undisturbed as she encountered a steady if small stream of protesters challenging the credentials of this Chicago native to seek office in New York State.
When Mrs. Clinton arrived for lunch, she was greeted by a small group of people shouting, "Go Home Hillary." That chant was drowned out by a rival chant of supporters, "We want Hillary."
At her news conference, Mrs. Clinton said she did not believe some of the issues that had shadowed her years in the White House -- such as the disappearance of her law firm records in the Whitewater case -- would be a problem in the campaign.
"New Yorkers will make their own judgments about that," she said. "I think we've moved beyond all of it. I'm going to be talking about the future of education and health care and making sure that upstate New York gets the same kind of economic opportunities that the rest of the state has enjoyed."
The First Lady's staff sought to present today's forum with voters as a spontaneous exchange of views, though there was some evidence of stage management at hand. For one thing, the First Lady is well known for her command of policy, and her aides acknowledged there was a limit to how much she might actually learn at these forums. And the people who attended the forum were all selected by the State University of New York at Oneonta, which had invited Mrs. Clinton to appear.
Mrs. Clinton seemed eager to come across as student rather than teacher. When someone at the forum said the upstate economy and schools were hobbled by the absence of high-speed Internet connections, the First Lady's eyes lit up. She asked him to give her a memo. At the Soccer Hall of Fame, she stopped to talk to Frank Bachelor after learning that he was a dairy farmer who owned 30 head of cattle at a farm in Monroe. "Dairy farmers need your support," said Mr. Bachelor. Mrs. Clinton responded with her own request. "I need your help. I know there is no harder job than being a farmer."
Mrs. Clinton got another lesson -- this one in New York media -- from Mr. Moynihan. At the start of her news conference, reporters -- including Gabe Pressman of WNBC in New York and Andrea Mitchell, the Washington correspondent for NBC -- gestured for her attention. Mrs. Clinton moved instinctively to call on Ms. Mitchell, a familiar face.
But then Mr. Moynihan gave her a little nudge of advice, and Mrs. Clinton did what most New York politicians would do in the situation. She called on Mr. Pressman.

HEADLINE: Clinton, Amid the Despair on a Reservation, Again Pledges Help

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: PINE RIDGE, S.D., July 7

 BODY:
Offering tax credits, loan guarantees and other incentives to encourage private businesses to create jobs and housing, President Clinton swept into the destitute Oglala Lakota Sioux reservation today, by many measures the sickest, most hopeless, most squalid corner of America.
To revive Pine Ridge and other impoverished communities of the kind that the President is visiting on his four-day tour of the nation, White House aides said that over five years the President wants to allow $980 million in tax credits to stimulate $6 billion in private investment for businesses. He is also seeking Federal appropriations of $81 million a year to subsidize and guarantee loans. 
 Like other Federal subsidies Mr. Clinton has proposed on his trip to underwrite programs, these would require Congressional action, though Mr. Clinton has not sent all the specific legislation to Capitol Hill.
The President is on a four-day tour of the nation's poorest communities, first in Kentucky and Mississippi, then here on the Great Plains and the nation's second-largest Indian reservation. This evening he visited a family-owned tortilla factory in Phoenix that was started with a loan from the Small Business Administration, and on Thursday he will travel to Los Angeles. Each time, he was sounding alarms about how the prosperity of nearly seven years in office has passed these areas by and the potential for help from what he called his "new markets initiatives."
"Our nation will never have a better chance" to help these communities, he said.
The Pine Ridge reservation with a population of about 25,000 spread over more than 3,100 square miles, is the United States' own third world country. It has been left far behind by the current economic boom and all of those that came before it. The second-largest reservation after that of the Navajo in Arizona and New Mexico, Pine Ridge has institutionalized squalor, with rampant alcoholism, diabetes, suicide and a male life expectancy rate of 56.5 years. Only 62 miles of road are paved.
Unemployment is rampant and unmeasurable. Mr. Clinton used a figure of "nearly 75 percent." Tribe leaders say it is 85 percent. Most of the few jobs are with the tribal bureaucracy, the Federal Government or the modest new casino, which has 150 Oglala Sioux workers.
Mr. Clinton toured hovels that people live in here, including that of a teary Geraldine Blue Bird, whose shack and trailer house 28 people in five bedrooms.
"See those houses on the street?" Ms. Blue Bird said to him. "You notice they don't have windows. That's because it has to come from the pocket, and we don't have that pocket."
Afterward, the President spoke in the sweltering heat outside the kindergarten-to-12th-grade Pine Ridge School, where many students board because their own homes on the two-million-acre reservation are too far away or too decrepit.
Mr. Clinton and other members of his party, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, and bankers and businessmen were warmly received.
But a sign in back of the crowd, painted on a sheet, said, "Stop Lakota ethnic cleansing," a reference to the tribe's loss of the Black Hills northwest of the reservation and the gold those hills held.
The Oglalas are the band of Crazy Horse, the victor over George Armstrong Custer at the battle of Little Big Horn in 1876, though that triumph soon gave way to the tribe's being relegated to this rolling grassland with no marketable resources.
The Oglalas continue to complain of a Government in Washington with misguided policies. They see themselves as a sovereign nation, and Mr. Clinton today, nodded to that idea, calling his a "nation to nation" visit.
It was the first time a President visited an Indian reservation since Franklin D. Roosevelt stopped at a Cherokee reservation in North Carolina in 1936 while on vacation.
"We hope the President can open a new chapter of Indian-Federal policy," said Dave Archambault, a councilman of the Standing Rock Reservation, which straddles North and South Dakota, "so we can sit down as equals and enhance the government-to-government relationship."
The tribes need a Marshall Plan, like the one that rebuilt Europe, Mr. Archambault said.
Mr. Clinton made no gestures of that magnitude. But his economic message also represents a big change in Federal policy. Departing from the largely discredited conventions of welfare and charity, formed a generation ago by President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, Mr. Clinton told the Oglalas and leaders of more than 100 other tribes attending his speech, "We will do our part."
By enlisting the private sector, the President is trying alternative approaches to aiding the poor.
"We're coming from Washington to ask you what you want to do and tell you we will give you the tools and support to get done what you want to do for your children and their future," he said.
Mr. Clinton has been given credit for holding a tribal summit several years back at the White House. Indian leaders also praise the President for protecting tribal sovereignty in siding with Indians and helping to block efforts in Congress to curb the power of Indian nations to govern themselves.
But the tribes also say he has deserted them on other issues. In 1995, Congress took aim at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, passing a spending bill that cut all Bureau operations by 25 percent. The cuts were later rescinded by about half, and that measure was signed by Mr. Clinton -- much to the chagrin of Indians who depend on the annual budget, of just over $1.2 billion, for many of their operations and jobs.
Also, Indians fault him for not doing a better job of cleaning up the mess over trust funds, owned by perhaps as many 500,000 individual Indians and held in trust by the Government. The documents showing how much money is managed in these funds are missing, lost or stolen, and the Indians have filed the biggest class-action suit ever by tribes to try and clean it up. A trial is now under way. In the course of the trial, two Clinton Cabinet members have been held in civil contempt for not producing records in a timely way for the court case.
"The Administration has been very good on sovereignty and gaming issues for the tribes," said John Dossett, general counsel for the National Congress of American Indians, the largest group representing Indians in Washington. "If you step back and look at the record from afar, I would think you have to give them a good grade."
But others are sharply critical, noting that thousands of Pine Ridge Sioux are part of the lawsuit to sort out their trust funds.
"Thousands of members of that tribe are being actively defrauded by the Clinton Administration," said Jim McCarthy, a consultant to tribes in the trust fund case. "For him to go out there and throw some crumbs off the Federal plate is really appalling, because here you have some of the poorest people in the country being denied what is theirs."

HEADLINE: AFTERMATH OF A HEAT WAVE: THE POWER;
Answers Are Sought on Blackout's Causes

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Shortly after 10 on Tuesday night, after hours of work on seven short-circuited power cables serving the north end of Manhattan, Consolidated Edison workers prepared to turn two of them back on. The goal was to restore electricity to 15,000 customers who had been without power all that scorching day and much of the night before.
At that point, most of Washington Heights and Inwood still had power because seven other cables carrying electricity to the neighborhoods from the local distribution station worked. Things were looking good, Michael Spall, a Con Edison spokesman, said. "We were close to restoring everything up there," he added. 
 But then everything went wrong. As the power flowed, one repaired cable failed again, a circuit breaker burst and a smoky fire erupted, Con Edison officials said.
To prevent further damage, at 10:11 P.M., Con Edison officials at the utility's main control center on the Upper West Side -- with a representative of City Hall in the room -- shut off power with the click of a computer mouse to all 200,000 people living north of 155th Street.
The result in the overheated city was the first prolonged large blackout since July 13, 1977, when lightning caused a cascade of failures that plunged eight million New Yorkers into darkness. A May 1996 blackout affected 40 percent of Queens, but lasted less than five hours in most places. Mr. Spall said that there was never any danger that the problems in upper Manhattan would spread to the rest of the city. Even so, he said, the fire required the prompt shutdown of the entire network at the north end of Manhattan.
"If we'd continued," he said, "there was a good chance that the remaining cables would overload, overheat and short circuit, and then we would have had much more work to repair today."
Late yesterday, almost all of the stilled appliances and lights came back on across upper Manhattan, but many questions remained about the cause of the short circuits in the power cables, the cause of the fire, and the ability of New York City's electricity distribution system to function reliably under increasing summertime demand.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and elected officials representing the affected communities called for an immediate review of Con Edison's backup systems. After touring affected neighborhoods, Guillermo Linares, a City Council member representing most of upper Manhattan, said, "There are many questions about the circumstances that led to the blackout of this particular sector rather than others."
He added that the city and Con Edison should look ahead to greater demands for power and anticipate the effect of long-term warming changes in the climate. "What they say is a rarity is likely to be more commonplace," Mr. Linares said. "We will be holding hearings to address this issue and make sure this does not occur again."
Mr. Spall said Con Edison regretted the problems that the blackout caused, but added that over all, the utility, according to independent industry surveys, had the best record of any large utility in the country for sending power reliably to customers.
Last night, he and other Con Edison officials said they had not yet pinpointed how the record heat might have resulted in the cable failures or even indirectly caused the fire. And they could not explain why it was the northern tip of Manhattan, not Wall Street or Brownsville or somewhere else, where the power cables failed.
Thomas Bisky, another spokesman for Con Edison, said the problems that occurred in upper Manhattan could happen anywhere in the system when heavy power use causes cables to heat up and to short circuit. Typically, he said, short circuits occur at splices or weak spots created where road salt seeps through cracks in insulation and corrodes wiring.
The result is sparking or arcs of electricity that cause small fires. The fires, in turn, can cause gases to build up under the street, and the resulting pressure pops manhole covers off. And, in fact, manhole covers did pop in several places in Inwood on Monday night.
He said the cables that failed would be examined over the next few weeks.
Mr. Spall said that each spring, the company studies the load it expects on peak hot days in the coming summer and bolsters cables and other systems. This year, Con Edison predicted that the highest usage on any one day would be 11,650 megawatts, and Tuesday's usage exceeded that by 200 megawatts, hitting a Con Edison record of 11,850 megawatts at the peak at 1 P.M.
The record usage came from a combination of the record temperatures coupled with continued strong growth in the economy, Mr. Spall said. The economy has increased the occupancy of buildings and the purchase of appliances like computers and air-conditioners, all contributing to the growing demand.
Around New York City, there are 1,157 13,000-volt "feeder cables" like the ones that failed in upper Manhattan, Mr. Spall said. Last spring, in a rotating testing program, the company tested 200 of those cables, he said, although yesterday he was unable to determine whether any of the tested cables were in upper Manhattan.
Of the tested cables, 153 were upgraded by replacing sections with heavier wire capable of handling more electricity, he said. On Tuesday, 50 of the 1,157 feeder cables around the city failed, including the 7 at the north end of Manhattan, Mr. Spall said. But the only large-scale power loss occurred uptown.
"We feel our summer preparations were adequate," Mr. Spall said. "We'll certainly take a look at what happened in Washington Heights to see what lessons are to be learned."
According to the New York State Public Service Commission, a Con Edison customer, on average, goes more than eight years between power failures. The interval between power failures around the rest of the state averages once every 11 months, the commission says.
Even so, private environmental groups said the power problems showed that the city and New York State should boost support for energy conservation so the system has fewer days when it is straining under record loads. In recent years, the state has sharply cut programs requiring utilities to help customers conserve energy. On July 23, 1991, Con Edison set a record with peak demand of 10,700 megawatts. That record was broken on July 17, 1997, at 11,013.
Con Edison currently cannot generate or import more than 12,700 megawatts through the existing network of high-power transmission lines, said Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group, so Tuesday's record of 11,850 megawatts means that it is inching ever closer to an energy deficit.
Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said, "The gutting of the energy conservation program has increased power demand and made events like this more likely."

Diagram: "The Power Failure"
The typical urban power delivery system involves a few basic steps. Here is an overview of how it works and where problems in Washington Heights are likely to have occurred.
 
1 -- Con Edison has 10 large power plants in the New York metropolitan area. It also purchases power from regional suppliers.
 
2 -- Underground transformers increase the voltage and transmit the electricity to substations and feeder stations around the city.
 
3 -- At substations and feeder stations, transformers decrease the voltage for distribution to consumers and businesses.
 
4 -- Problems may have first arisen in Washington Heights when seven feeder cables failed, causing some 15,000 residents to lose power.
 
5 -- While technicians were repairing two of the cables, a fire erupted at the local substation. Con Edison officials decided to cut power to the substation to prevent more damage, and the blackout began. (pg. B4)

Capturing the Listeners In Genghis Khan Country

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago, Paul Pena, a blind San Francisco-based blues musician of Cape Verdean descent, was listening to his shortwave radio when he was riveted by some eerie vocal sounds on a program broadcast from Radio Moscow.
What captured his ear turned out to be "throat singing," a technique by which the human voice produces multiple sounds, typically a low-pitched warbling drone (much like the sound of the didjeridoo, an Australian aboriginal trumpet made out of hollowed wood) accompanied by higher whistling overtones. 
 The style is one of several art forms developed in Tuva, a Central Asian republic of nearly 400,000 people, about the size of North Dakota, on a plateau wedged between northwestern Mongolia and southern Siberia. It is the home of descendants of Genghis Khan.
For the next 10 years, Mr. Pena worked to develop similar vocal sounds, which he incorporated into his blues music. And in 1993, when he learned that a group of Tuvan throat singers were touring the United States for the first time, he attended their concert in San Francisco and afterward introduced himself to the musicians and sang some of their traditional songs to them. The rich gravelly style he had developed prompted the Tuvans to nickname Mr. Pena "Earthquake," and they invited him to travel to their country to participate in its triennial throat singing contest in 1995.
Roko Belic's good-hearted, wonderfully revealing film "Genghis Blues" is the record of that arduous but triumphant journey, which Mr. Pena made with a small film crew and some friends. At the contest, Mr. Pena, accompanying himself on the guitar, so delighted the Tuvan audience with his performance in what is called the kargyraa style of throat singing that he was chosen the audience's favorite. It's easy to see why. The music Mr. Pena made was very different from the hovering, ethereal chantlike sound of traditional Tuvan throat singing. Muscular, earthy and aggressive, it melds American blues music and Asian chant into a rugged Asian-American fusion.
As "Genghis Blues" shows, the journey from San Francisco to Central Asia was fraught with difficulties. Mr. Pena, who is clinically depressed as well as blind, periodically found himself disoriented, and the trip almost had to be cut short when his antidepressant medication ran out. One member of the group also had a heart attack.
The climate in Tuva ranges from extreme heat to cold, and life there is rustic, with an economy still largely based on nomadic animal herding. The film shows a sheep slaughtering ceremony, and the serving of delicacies like the fat from a lamb's rump and a vodka distilled from milk. But the Tuvans, most of whom practice a mixture of Tibetan Buddhism and animist shamanism, radiate a beatific joy. Mr. Pena's host and guide around the country was its leading throat singer, Kongar-ol Ondar, who is said to be the country's Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy and Michael Jackson rolled into one. He radiates a gracious, smiling exuberance that appears completely unforced.
Without being mushy about it, "Genghis Blues," which opens today at Cinema Village, reminds us music is a universal language that can go a long way toward bridging cultural and linguistic gaps. It also reminds us that in some ways modern telecommunications and transportation have turned the world into a global village, enabling musical roots 10,000 miles apart to intertwine.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Expanded in May

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Borrowing by consumers grew at the fastest pace in four months in May, led by record demand for cars and trucks, Federal Reserve figures showed today.
Borrowing through credit cards, auto loans and other personal loans rose $12.1 billion, to $1.345 trillion, after rising a revised $500 million in April. Previously, the Fed said April borrowing increased $3.7 billion. 
 May's increase was the largest since a $15.2 billion increase in January. Before today's report, analysts had expected an increase of $5.4 billion for May.
Revolving loans, which include credit cards, increased $2.1 billion in May after rising $2.8 billion in April. Auto and other loans rose $10 billion after decreasing $2.3 billion in April. The May report was the first time auto loans and other loans were combined into one category.
Consumer credit was rising at a 10.9 percent annual rate during May, up from a four-tenths of a percent rate in April.
In a separate report today, Labor Department figures showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell by 6,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 -- the third consecutive decline and the lowest since the week ended March 27.
As for borrowing, the pace has mostly accelerated for five years; the last time consumer credit fell was November 1997.
Purchases of cars and light trucks hit an annual rate of 17.1 million in May, a record for the month and one of the five highest ever. Ford and DaimlerChrysler, the No. 2 and No. 3 American auto makers, reported higher sales in May compared with May 1998. Moreover, auto makers reported last week that the rate of sales for the industry continued in June, capping a record first half.
Consumer demand continued to gain in June. Retail sales at stores open at least a year rose 6.5 percent in June as shoppers splurged on summer fashions at department stores, industry figures showed today.

HEADLINE: Panel Urges Plan to Curb Proliferation Of Weapons

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
The Government's efforts to fight the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons are disorganized and overlapping, says an independent commission that calls for a new White House czar to direct a streamlined defense against "a grave threat to the United States."
In a report to be sent to Congress next week, the bipartisan panel implicitly criticizes President Clinton and recommends that a national coordinator head a council of senior officials from the Departments of State, Defense, Commerce and Energy and from the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 This new organization would coordinate policy making and budgeting among as many as 96 often-competing Federal agencies that are now involved in preventing or responding to the spread of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, and the means to deliver them.
The report did not address domestic threats like terrorist attacks, but instead focused on ways to create more effective responses to matters like detecting foreign germ warfare programs and reducing the risk of nuclear material being lost or stolen from the Russian stockpile.
"The U.S. Government is not effectively organized to combat proliferation," the report says. "With no one specifically in charge of all proliferation-related efforts, no one is ultimately accountable to the President and to Congress."
The panel's recommendations come as North Korea is threatening to launch another long-range missile, perhaps capable of reaching the West Coast, and the world's two newest declared nuclear powers, India and Pakistan, are waging war along their border in Kashmir.
In light of a House investigation that concluded that China has been systematically stealing information about American nuclear warheads and missiles since the 1970's, many lawmakers want to move nuclear weapons work from the Energy Department to the Defense Department to increase security over the nation's atomic secrets.
In a telephone interview, John M. Deutch, a former Director of Central Intelligence who headed the panel, said, "The Government must reorganize itself if it's going to meet the more dangerous proliferation threats we now face."
Congress set up the panel, the Commission to Assess the Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, in October 1996.
An advanced copy of the 178-page report was obtained by The New York Times. The commission's findings were first reported this week in The Philadelphia Inquirer.
The commission's recommendations touch virtually every Federal agency with a role in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and Mr. Deutch predicted that many Federal officials would balk at reorganizing their efforts and perhaps relinquishing some of their bureaucratic authority.
The White House reacted cautiously today to the report's findings and recommendations.
"This is a serious and thoughtful report that we're going to study very carefully," said a senior Administration official who has read the report.
At the Pentagon, Deputy Defense Secretary John J. Hamre told reporters that the United States was well prepared to stop the use of nuclear weapons but less prepared to combat other threats.
The 12-member panel declared, "The President must lead efforts" to combat the threat and to direct a more cohesive, effective counterattack.
While the threats from biological, chemical and nuclear weapons the panel described are not new, the ominous world backdrop against which the report is being made public gives new urgency to the findings, panel members said.
In a sign of the continuing economic turmoil in Russia, the panel reported at least seven instances since 1992 when weapons-grade fissionable material was stolen from Russian plants or storage sites. "Russia has no reliable inventory of its fissile material," the report said.
At the same time, countries like Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Syria either have or are seeking biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, and China has sold missiles or missile technology to Iran and Pakistan, it said.
"You have a many-headed monster out there," said Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who is vice chairman of the panel.
Even so, many Federal agencies have been slow to respond to the threat, the commission said.
The Persian Gulf war, for example, exposed shortcomings in the military's ability to detect biological or chemical agents. Eight years and billions of dollars in research later, the commission said the military had made little progress in developing more advanced technology.

HEADLINE: Forgotten Corners of America

 BODY:
Few places in America are as impoverished as the Pine Ridge Indian reservation in South Dakota. On Wednesday, President Clinton sat on a dilapidated porch belonging to a woman who had 28 people living in her five bedrooms. He heard about the troubles of a place where the unemployment rate among the Oglala Sioux is 73 percent. The day before, on a sweltering afternoon, he walked through the boarded-up streets of the Mississippi Delta town of Clarksdale.
This week Mr. Clinton traveled through some of America's poorest areas, turning attention to communities left out of the prosperity enjoyed by much of the country. Such trips can raise awareness of poverty, often, most importantly, for the politicians themselves. John Kennedy began his anti-poverty programs after being haunted by what he saw while campaigning in West Virginia. Robert Kennedy's visit to the Mississippi Delta in 1967 helped set one of the themes of his Presidential campaign. 
 Mr. Clinton is the first President to make an official visit to an Indian reservation since Calvin Coolidge. He is also promoting an innovative, if somewhat limited, program designed to inject $15 billion in new capital into these communities, a more promising plan than some previous initiatives to help depressed areas.
America's current economic expansion, while broad, has produced inequality not seen since the Depression. From 1980 to 1995, the earnings of those at the bottom fell by more than a quarter in real terms, and many also worked less and lost benefits such as employer-paid health insurance. Their lot has improved slightly since 1995, but they are still worse off than those at the bottom 20 years ago.
The main reason is that this boom is centered on the knowledge industry, which demands well-educated, skilled workers. Many of the low-skill light manufacturing jobs that expanded in previous booms have moved overseas. Unionization has declined, and the minimum wage has dropped in real terms. The President visited six communities bypassed by economic recovery -- Pine Ridge, towns in Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, the city of East St. Louis, Ill., a Hispanic neighborhood of Phoenix and the Watts area of Los Angeles. All suffer from poor education and low skills, buying power and access to credit, as well as few contacts with the business world so necessary for attracting investment.
Mr. Clinton's New Markets Initiative would cost the Government $1.6 billion, most of that going to a 25 percent tax credit for investments such as community development banks and venture capital funds that aim to bring new capital to poor communities nationwide. Other parts of the program would provide technical assistance and loan guarantees.
The initiative is small, and may take more time than direct government spending to help these communities. But a well-run program could help create new investments rather than moving old ones around. Many poor areas are better markets and less risky investments than businesses realize.
Members of Congress should refrain from funneling the money to their own districts, as they did with enterprise zones. The political powerlessness of Indian reservations and coal mining towns leaves them vulnerable, but makes Mr. Clinton's decision to highlight their problems all the more welcome.

ResurgingOil Prices Lead Rally in Commodities

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The prices of key commodities, whose decline helped restrain inflation the last few years, are climbing again.
Oil is leading the charge. Crude has been flirting with $20 a barrel this week, and financial analysts expect it to pass that benchmark easily. Some see $25 a barrel by the end of the year, a further increase of 25 percent. The price has jumped 73 percent from its low point of the year, $11.37, reached in February. 
 Moreover, the prices of some other important commodities for industrial uses are staging small rallies. Copper has risen 15 percent this year while aluminum has gained 12.8 percent, nickel 44.1 percent, and zinc 20.4 percent.
"We put the lows behind us in March," said Ted Arnold, minerals strategist at the Hamburg Metals Division of Prudential-Bache Ltd. in London. This rebound has not spread to agricultural commodities, however, which continue to slump.
One factor in the industrial commodity rebound, analysts say, is a revival in many of the world's economies from the global financial crisis that began in July 1997.
"Data for world economic growth suggest that rates are going to be higher than thought just a few months ago," said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch. "In the first year of a recovery there is always a rise in demand for copper and other base metals."
But some other factors have also pushed up commodity prices and will continue to put pressure on the market in the months ahead. For example, the rally in copper in the last month has been abetted by a series of announcements about production cutbacks. Asarco is reducing its copper mine output by 7 percent. The Phelps Dodge Corporation is trimming production by 8 percent, while Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia will shut all its mines in the United States and reduce global production by 1.7 percent.
Some other influences will probably be temporary. Gasoline prices jumped to a 19-month high on Wednesday after Sunoco said a power failure had closed the Point Breeze unit, which normally produces 130,000 barrels a day, at its Philadelphia refinery for a week. Copper jumped 3 percent on Wednesday because of speculation that Canadian workers would strike at Falconbridge's metallurgical division in Ontario. When the strike was called yesterday, copper slipped 0.4 cent, to 77.80 cents a pound.
For oil, which closed at $19.71 a barrel for August delivery yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the improved outlook can be directly linked to the success of the OPEC countries in maintaining production cutbacks. While the price of oil surged after the countries reached an agreement in March to reduce production, many analysts questioned whether the parties would adhere to the terms.
Mr. Rothman of Merrill Lynch said that analysts were expecting 70 percent compliance. But compliance was 93 percent in May, he said. (Analysts use different measures, but their compliance estimates were clustered around 90 percent.) The confirmation of that unity was what was needed to get oil's second rally going. The price had fallen as low as $16.34 a barrel on June 1 after peaking at $18.98 on May 5.
Mr. Rothman predicts oil could end the year as high as $22 a barrel, although he added there could be a selloff between now and $22. Frederick P. Leuffer, the senior energy analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, is speaking of a "shockingly high" $25 a barrel.
The compliance of OPEC members and the resulting decline in inventories of both crude oil and refined petroleum products will drive the price higher, he said. He estimates that if OPEC production remains steady at the 26 million barrels a day posted in May, inventories at the end of this year will be lower than at the end of 1996, when oil averaged $24.56 a barrel in the fourth quarter and finished the year just below $26.
The American Petroleum Institute reported after the market closed Wednesday that crude oil inventories dropped 1.92 million barrels, to 327.94 million barrels last week. Gasoline inventories dropped 4.4 million barrels, to 216.38 million barrels.
The oil outlook has changed so quickly that Mr. Leuffer still has an official forecast of $19.50 a barrel in the second half of the year. But, he said, "I see a case developing for $25 oil or higher."
This jump in oil and other industrial commodities is important for investors, even though it is not expected to produce any big jump in consumer prices or inflation over the longer term. Kathryn Kobe, senior economist at Joel Popkin & Company in Washington, said that the jump in oil prices -- and the resulting surge in gasoline prices -- had forced her to add about two-tenths of one percentage point to her forecasted gain in the Consumer Price Index this year. She now expects it to rise 2.4 percent from December to December, compared with a 1.6 percent increase last year.
That would put inflation back at its pace in 1997. So it is in no sense an inflationary breakout.
But an outsized jump in just one month could be enough to force the Federal Reserve to raise its target for short-term interest rates another quarter of a percentage point. The quarter-point increase that Fed policy makers announced at the end of June was prompted, in part, by the seven-tenths of one percent surge in consumer prices in April.
Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, estimates that an average oil price of $21 a barrel this month would push gasoline prices to $1.28 a gallon. And that would be enough to produce a five-tenths of one percentage point jump in the Consumer Price Index.
The consumer price figure for July will be reported Aug. 17, just a week before the next meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers. And Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at American Skandia Life Assurance in Shelton, Conn., said a move of that magnitude would force the Fed's hand. "If the C.P.I. jumps up again because of oil or because of other commodity price increases," he predicted, "they will snug up again."

HEADLINE: Clinton Ends Visit to Poor With an Appeal for Support

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., July 8

 BODY:
Flanked by Magic Johnson, President Clinton wrapped up his four-day tour of poverty in America today with a whirlwind visit to a job-training program at a high school in the heart of the Watts section of Los Angeles, then challenged corporate executives to provide more support for preparing disadvantaged students for jobs in the booming information economy.
"Money is a big issue here," Mr. Clinton said at the annual meeting of the American Academy Foundation, a private group led by corporate chiefs that sponsors vocational training for public high school students at risk of dropping out, referring to his efforts to encourage investment in poor areas. 
 But education and "human capital" are equally important, Mr. Clinton said, and unless the nation is prepared to nurture them, too, "even our best efforts to bring new investments to these distressed communities will be unsuccessful."
A journey that took Mr. Clinton from the hollows of Appalachia to the Black Hills of South Dakota, from the sweltering Mississippi Delta to a sweaty tortilla factory in Phoenix, ended at a hotel ballroom here in the shadow of Disneyland -- and at times, the endeavor had a surreal air. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, once Mr. Clinton's frequent antagonist and later his spiritual counselor in the travails of impeachment, accompanied the President all week, lending his support to Mr. Clinton's self-described effort to "shine the spotlight on places still unlit by the sunshine of our present prosperity," and Mr. Clinton thanked him warmly today.
Still, it was Mr. Clinton's most extensive domestic trip in many months that did not involve political fund-raising among the rich and famous, and the President seemed energized by the effort, racing from stop to stop in campaign style, taking in a Memphis barbecue and a floodlighted Mount Rushmore with his customary appetite, sounding a bit tired only this afternoon.
But he pledged to keep up the theme, announcing plans for another tour this fall, starting in Newark, where he will highlight efforts by the owners of the New Jersey Nets to re-invest in that long-suffering city.
"It can't be the end of the journey," Mr. Clinton said of his trip. "It has to be the opening salvo in a battle to build a real economy in every community."
As he has on each day of his national tour, Mr. Clinton sounded a flurry of notes today -- warning of the growing gap between the rich and poor in access to technology and highlighting private sector sponsorship of job training -- all in service of a single theme: that the nation's pockets of poverty offer a great untapped market that can help keep the economy growing without inflation.
"How can you keep it going?" Mr. Clinton asked a round table of students at Southwest Community College in long-struggling Watts, where the unemployment rate is three times the national average. "The easiest way to keep it going is to go to places where there aren't enough jobs and there aren't enough consumers and create more of both."
But having spent three days emphasizing his proposals for $1 billion in new Federal tax incentives intended to encourage $5 billion in private investment in poor areas -- which he said he would send to Congress next week -- Mr. Clinton turned today to the other end of the equation: training a work force to fill the jobs such new businesses would create.
"We can put in place the financial networks," Mr. Clinton told the round-table group. "We can create a lot of jobs."
But at a time when 60 percent of young people in the impoverished areas he has visited this week are neither in school nor at work, Mr. Clinton said, it is clear that "in the world we're living in, there is a high premium, in an information society, placed on knowledge, skills, what you know today and what you can continue to learn."
To that end, the President chose to highlight the work of the National Academy Foundation, which sponsors special training "academies," special schools within schools, that prepare students for careers in finance and travel and tourism through a combination of in-school teaching and on-the-job training. The program, started in Brooklyn in 1982, already serves 20,000 high school students in 37 states, and today, Mr. Clinton joined the foundation's founder, Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup, to announce $8 million in support from private companies, including Lucent Technologies and AT&T, to create a new academy program for information technology.
The goal is to have 10 pilot sites, serving 350 to 400 students, in operation by September 2000, with 40 to 50 more sites to be added annually after that. The White House said the need for such training was clear, citing the Commerce Department's third annual study, released today, which found a growing gap in access to telephones, computers and the Internet between Americans at the highest income and education levels and those at the lowest.
"If our country is going to be the leader 50 years from today, we have to include everybody, and everybody has to participate in it," Mr. Weill said. "Education is what unlocks the key to one's future."
Mr. Clinton was introduced here today by Hazel del Rosario, 22, who just graduated from the University of Hawaii, and is preparing for a career in the airline industry. Her family emigrated from the Philippines when she was a child, and though she initially spoke no English she was placed in a bilingual education program and later, in a special academy of travel and tourism sponsored by the National Academy Foundation at her high school.
"Before I entered the program, I didn't know what I wanted to do," Ms. del Rosario said in an interview, wearing a fragrant lei of white ginger blossoms that she carried in a cooler from Hawaii on Wednesday. "We didn't only learn about classroom stuff, we also learned about real-life situations, and being able to speak to people in public."
In Watts, which was scarred by riots in 1965 and 1992, during Mr. Clinton's first campaign for the White House, the President joined Mr. Johnson, the former basketball star who now operates a chain of inner-city movie theaters, to sound the need for job training in a neighborhood that was once overwhelmingly black but has been transformed in recent years by a surge of Hispanic immigration and fitful efforts at economic recovery.
At Alain Leroy Locke High School, named for the nation's first black Rhodes scholar, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Johnson and Gov. Gray Davis toured a transportation training program and watched students use computers to demonstrate the aerodynamic effects of automotive design.
"This one does better than this one," Mr. Clinton said, holding a yellow plastic car that trailed its competitor positioned in front of a jet stream simulator by Michael Delery, 17, and Jermaine Smith, 18. "Even I know that."
When Ruben Garcia, 17, showed the President a sound-engineering machine that can change the pitch of a human voice, rendering an off-key singer on pitch, Mr. Clinton, a dedicated amateur saxophonist and hymn-singer, marveled, "So it's like a high-tech karaoke bar."

HEADLINE: For 3d Year, No. 7 Line Tops a Ranking of Subway Service

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Amid the surging use of the subways and rider-friendly innovations like discounted fares and Metrocard vending machines, one fact of subway service remains the same: some lines work much better than others.
The disparity was underscored yesterday in the third annual "State of the Subways Report," released by the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group. For New Yorkers convinced that their daily subway commute could not be worse, the report may contain revelations. 
 The best subway line? The report, based on data compiled by New York City Transit, which runs the city's 24 subway lines, found little competition there. As in each of the previous two years, its blue ribbon went to the No. 7 line, which runs between Flushing, Queens, and Times Square.
Taking into account the frequency of service, breakdowns, crowding, cleanliness and the quality of announcements, the report found that the No. 7 line held on to its top ranking because it provided riders with unusually frequent and reliable service. But like most other lines, the report said, cars on the No. 7 line were dirtier and announcements were more difficult to understand than in prior years.
Which line is the worst? The report found three tied for that distinction, all falling near the bottom of the pack in each of the categories used to measure service quality. They were the A, B and M lines.
Over all, the analysis seemed to give New York City Transit a middling grade for subway service -- perhaps a straight C, pushed up to a B-minus when problems in handling a huge increase in ridership were taken into account.
New York City Transit says the subways are carrying an average of 4.2 million riders each weekday, 500,000 more than at the end of 1997.
"The increase is staggering," said the Straphangers Campaign report, adding that New York City Transit is "struggling to handle a flood of new riders attracted by fare discounts and a solid local economy."
Al O'Leary, a spokesman for the transit agency, said yesterday that the report's findings were unfair, because they failed to give the agency enough credit for handling the increasing service levels rapidly. Among the complexities faced by the transit agency, he said, were determining where and when to add service, since the largest share of the system's increased ridership has come on weekends, at night and during periods other than rush hours. "I don't think this report lends anything to the improvement of mass transit in New York City," he said.
Still, in its comparison of service quality on the subway lines, the report pointed out wide disparities.
Riders on the east side of Manhattan, who have complained for years about the reliability of No. 6 line -- the local train under Lexington Avenue -- may not be surprised that the report found that the No. 6 had the most frequent problems with train bunching or gaps in scheduled service. The No. 6 also tied with the No. 7 line in having the most scheduled service, with trains intended to arrive every 2.5 minutes, compared with a system average of slightly more than 6 minutes.
The frequency of mechanical failures varies widely on different lines, the report said, with the R train having the worst record last year. It said trains on the R line broke down once every 43,826 miles, nearly four times as often as those on the most mechanically sound line, the No. 4, where trains broke down every 162,718 miles.
An even bigger gap was found in the cleanliness of trains. The report said inspections by the New York City Transit workers, conducted while trains were carrying passengers, found that the E line was the worst, with 84 percent of its cars littered or dirty. The cleanest trains were on the C line, where 9 percent of the cars failed the cleanliness test.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Technology Shares Lift Nasdaq to Another Record

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Technology stocks swept the Nasdaq market to its fifth record in six sessions yesterday, while other widely watched gauges sagged, rallied, then faded again to finish lower.
Investors took heart from Yahoo's better-than-expected profit report, issued late Wednesday, which was seen as a harbinger of a parade of favorable quarterly results by high-technology companies. 
 Stocks were also supported by strong demand for $10.8 billion of corporate debt securities, which revived a sinking bond market. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue, for example, rose as high as 6.10 percent at midday before the price of the bond rallied, pushing the yield to 5.99 percent at the close, down from 6.04 on Wednesday. The price and yield move in opposite directions.
"I was amazed at how well bonds did," said Philip J. Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "If we can get some constructive inflation data next week, we can get this rally into gear."
On the other hand, tobacco stocks were mostly lower in continued reaction to a Florida jury's verdict that the industry conspired to hide the ill-effects of cigarettes. And retailing stocks, with a few exceptions, failed to benefit from a surprisingly strong tally of June sales. Sales in stores that have been open at least a year rose 6.5 percent last month, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index.
Philip Morris, which fell 2 5/8 after the adverse court decision late Wednesday, clawed back 3/8, to finish at 38 1/4. Brooke Group fell 1 9/16, to 21 15/16; R. J. Reynolds fell 3/4, to 30 1/8, and Universal slid 1/2, to 28 15/16.
Costco, which operates wholesale warehouses, jumped 4 1/8, to 86 9/16, but Consolidated Stores, which said it expected to report a loss for the current quarter, skidded 6 7/8, to 16 1/2. Wal-Mart fell 1, to 47; J. C. Penney, 1 1/2, to 47 1/4; Sears, 15/16, to 46 1/16, and Saks, 3 5/16, to 26.
The Nasdaq market finished ahead by 1.05 percent at a record 2,771.86 as MCI Worldcom jumped 4 13/16, to 90, and most computer-related stocks posted multipoint gains.
Among the high-technology standouts was Hewlett-Packard, which surged 6 1/2, to 105 13/16, to help support the Dow Jones industrial average, which, nevertheless, finished with a loss of 60.47 points, or half of 1 percent, at 11,126.89. J. P. Morgan, down 4 13/16 at 141 3/16, was the biggest loser in the group of 30 blue chips.
The Dow pulled out of an early 95-point slump to show a 24-point rise at midsession, only to slip back into negative territory, as investors appeared to cash in profits. Some money may have been shifted into the bond deals, $7.8 billion by Ford Motor and $3 billion by Freddie Mac that came in the wake of the Government's big sale of inflation-indexed bonds on Wednesday.
Profit taking was also evident in Yahoo, which had run up sharply in advance of reporting earnings late on Wednesday that beat even the so-called whisper figure. The stock of Yahoo, the biggest Internet search service, closed down 2 5/8 at 164 7/16 after trading as high as 175 1/4. It fell 8 1/16 on Wednesday.
With the technology sector strong, however, Dell Computer gained 1 5/8, and Compaq rose 13/16.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished with little change, down 1.44, or one-tenth of 1 percent, at 1,394.42 as big gains in a relatively few heavily weighted stocks made up for the fact that 292 of its components fell, while just 187 gained.
Meanwhile, the comprehensive Wilshire 5000 eased six hundredths of a percent, but the Russell 2000 gauge, composed entirely of small-company stocks, advanced nearly one-half of 1 percent.
Salomon Smith Barney issued its annual list of 15 most attractive stocks, which included the sharply rising MCI Worldcom. The others are Albertson's, Allstate, Amgen, Bank of New York, Dayton Hudson, Electronic Data, Fort James, Honeywell, Lucent, Marsh & McLennan, Mobil, Pitney Bowes, Raytheon and Tyco.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange expanded to 830.62 million from 776.8 million as 1,315 issues rose and 1,684 fell.
Major overseas markets were mixed, with none changing by as much as 1 percent except for the Bovespa in Brazil, down 2 percent.

HEADLINE: G.E.'s Quarterly Earnings Top Expectations

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
The General Electric Company, benefiting from its continued push into high-margin service businesses as well as from improved efficiency, reported yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose 15 percent, slightly beating analysts' expectations.
G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., posted earnings of $2.82 billion, or 85 cents a diluted share, which compared with $2.45 billion, or 74 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The company enjoyed strong top-line growth in each of its 11 businesses, lifting revenue 9.3 percent, to $27.4 billion from $25.1 billion. 
 Although G.E.'s earnings beat analysts' estimates by a penny a share, its stock still foundered in a down market. After investors drove the stock up $4 this week in anticipation of stellar numbers, shares of G.E. fell 93.75 cents, to $117.
Still, most analysts say the solid performance is a harbinger of better quarters ahead. "The underlying growth of this company is a tad better than people had been assuming," said Russell A. Leavitt, an analyst with Banc of America Securities.
There was some bad news: price pressure hurt earnings in its appliance business, while the finance arm, GE Capital, has had trouble with accounts receivable in a few of the companies it acquired last year.
Still, GE Capital led the company's earnings growth, with a 17 percent increase, to $1.092 billion.
Even the company's NBC television unit had strong growth, with earnings up 15 percent. "Considering that most of its competitors are struggling to get by, NBC's numbers are staggering," said one analyst, whose firm's policy prohibits identification.
The company's Six Sigma program, which is intended to produce near-perfect quality and eliminate defects, also contributed.
Unlike most industrial companies, G.E. was helped by the Asian economic crisis. It has expanded in Asia primarily through acquisitions, "so it used the strong dollar to pick up assets at rock-bottom prices," Mr. Leavitt said..
G.E.'s industrial businesses had a particularly lucrative quarter. The booming economy has sent utilities rushing to buy generators. That pushed the volume at GE Power Systems up by 60 percent for the first half, "and this hot summer means sales will remain strong," Bruce Bunch, a G.E. spokesman, said.
The fast-growing market for small aircraft helped GE Aircraft Engines, which also was just named the exclusive supplier of engines for the Boeing Corporation's new long-range 777 aircraft. The industrial businesses also are experiencing increased demand for maintenance and other high-margin services.
And G.E. continues to invest in Internet technologies and companies. Polymerland, G.E.'s plastics distribution business, already conducts 15 percent of its business on the Internet. NBC joined the fast-growing portal site Xoom.com to create NBC Internet, a publicly traded company with services that NBC can promote on its broadcast shows and which can in turn promote NBC-related products on the Internet.
The appliances business has joined Buildnet.net to sell refrigerators and other large items to contractors over the Internet. GE Capital has invested in more than 40 Internet companies and has started operating a vehicle-leasing business on line.
"All of our businesses are going flat out to utilize E-commerce," Mr. Bunch said.

For 3K Freedom

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A cry for self-determination is again sending shudders through world capitals. This time it's in Kashmir, a lovely land coveted by autocratic Pakistan, most of it occupied by 600,000 troops of democratic India.
Pakistan unofficially sent a small force across the "Line of Control" to take up mountain peak positions, and the Indian Army is fighting -- literally uphill -- to drive it back. 
 The purpose of Pakistan's raid is to get world attention paid to India's unwillingness to negotiate the status of Kashmir, which both sides claim. At the moment the world sides with India because it is resisting an act of aggression, albeit symbolic.
What has everybody touchy is that India and Pakistan are now nuclear powers, and a third war between them could depopulate the subcontinent. Last week, Pakistan's Prime Minister felt the need to race to Washington to seek President Clinton's mediation.
Why? My guess is that Chinese intelligence, which has penetrated India's nuclear facilities as much as it has our own, tipped off its longtime ally, Pakistan, about increased Indian nuclear readiness. China also wishes its ally to back off because world pressure on India to end its occupation of Kashmir would set a precedent for Tibet.
As a result, Clinton promised to take a "personal interest" (which India wants no part of). Pakistan's Prime Minister raced home to tell his generals they had made their point -- and should now pull back those supposedly freelancing liberators.
Let's climb up our own mountain peak to survey the international 3K trend toward "protectoration."
In Kosovo, NATO acted forcefully to stop Serbia's bloody assertion of sovereignty. Because we are loath to redraw borders, we deny Kosovo independence but will enforce its autonomy. It is now a protectorate of NATO; after a decent interval, a plebiscite will probably be held to permit self-determination.
In the Kurdish section of Iraq, the U.S. and its allies have bolstered their "no-fly" edict with a "no-go" policy toward Saddam Hussein's tanks. The dictator knows that if he moves on Kurdish self-governing forces in his north, out will go the lights in Baghdad and sirens will sound in his germ warfare factories. Iraqi Kurdistan is a de facto protectorate, dependent on the resolve of the U.S. President.
In Kashmir, we see a protectorate-in-waiting. As the British learned in India, and as the Israelis learned on much of the West Bank, a democracy's administration of a hostile population is ultimately self-defeating.
And India is a democracy. Much as it wants to incorporate Kashmir, it faces growing local resistance and its own ensuing repression and brutalization. Forget "world opinion"; Indian self-respect and economic self-interest will impel it toward the granting of ever-greater autonomy to the Kashmiris.
But what then? Autonomy is desirable; it is seen as a grand experiment in diversity-within-unity, and works fine in Puerto Rico and Scotland. But in most of the world, autonomy is a peaceful stop on the way to self-determination. In Kurdistan and Kosovo, that means independence.
What about Kashmir? In India's eyes, Pakistan is a garrison state with connections to Afghan terrorists and with missile ties to Communist China and crazy North Korea. It salivates at the prospect of swallowing Kashmir. Would Kashmiris be able to fend off or be better off under militant Muslim rule?
Moderate Pakistanis say: Give Kashmir much more autonomy. Start pulling out your occupation forces. We'll promise not to infiltrate. Let the Kashmiris decide their future.
India won't go for that for years. But Kashmir is like a fault in the political earth, the tectonic plates under growing pressure, and the now-nuclear region has much to fear from the Big One. The answer may well take the form of protectorate as it has in Kosovo and Kurdistan -- but in this case, the intercession would be invited by all three parties rather than punitively imposed.
Nobody planned this protectoration trend. Nor does it offer finality, because the world is not about to take over the world. But it seems to be a way of giving peoples time to sort things out for themselves.
 
A. M. Rosenthal and Thomas L. Friedman are on vacation.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
A Rental Neighborhood Along the Hudson's Edge

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
From Port Imperial Boulevard, which parallels the nearly milelong Hudson River waterfront in West New York, N.J., the view is of a changing landscape. What was an industrial wasteland is being reborn as a $700 million residential community, called Port Imperial North, which is to have 4,300 residences on 100 acres hugging the river's edge in this Hudson County town atop the Palisades cliffs across from midtown Manhattan.
The development's first rental neighborhood, the Landings, is rising on the northern end of the site, where rail and shipping operations once stood. And though the project is two months away from completion, 35 percent of its 276 one- to three-bedroom apartments have been leased, according to the developer, a partnership between the Roseland Property Company of Roseland, N.J., and the Prudential Insurance Company of America in Newark. The units, many with river views, have 700 to 1,520 square feet of space, and rent for $1,430 to $3,500 a month. 
 The goal "is to bring 500 residences a year to the market to meet the ongoing demand for waterside housing," said Marshall B. Tycher, a Roseland principal. A second rental project, Riverbend, with 516 units, is midway through construction.
Roseland also is a partner with Arthur E. Imperatore in the development of 90 adjacent acres in Weehawken, the base for Mr. Imperatore's ferry service to Manhattan. Plans there call for 1,600 more housing units, a hotel and 1.3 million square feet of commercial space.
Together, the two projects, which will offer a mix of housing, from rentals and condominiums to apartments for the elderly, make up what is among the larger riverfront projects begun in the second round of redevelopment along the Hudson's west bank since the 1991 recession. The activity resumed in mid-1995 and has steadily gained momentum.
Nearly 3,000 residences, most of them luxury rentals, are in various stages of development in the Hudson County riverfront towns of Jersey City, Weehawken, West New York and Hoboken, according to the ACI Group, a concern in Jersey City that tracks waterfront development. Despite the growing supply, the rental vacancy rate for that area remains under 3 percent and the pace of absorption is steady, ACI's president, Robert P. Antonicello, said.
"The big engine for us is Manhattan," Mr. Tycher of Roseland added, noting that most of the leases signed at the Landings were by people from Manhattan and young professionals from the area. The project is also attracting empty-nester and executive couples, he said.
Brian G. Edwards, director of leasing at the Halstead Property Company, a Manhattan brokerage, said, "The city's hot rental as well as for-sale markets continue to have a spillover effect on the New Jersey waterfront, which is drawing some people out of Manhattan, looking for less expensive housing." But, he said, there are enough tenants for developers on both sides of the river.
The average rent for new riverfront apartments in Hudson County is now $26 a square foot per year, compared with $45 a square foot for comparable units in Manhattan, according to Marketing Directors, a consulting and marketing concern in Manhattan. Monthly rent for a typical 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom riverfront unit in New Jersey would be $2,166; in Manhattan, $3,750.
The expanding work force at the river's edge will also continue to feed housing demand, said Adrienne Albert, president of Marketing Directors. She was referring to the one million square feet of office space in two buildings on Jersey City's waterfront recently leased to companies that include American Express and U.S. Trust.
As a corollary, Mr. Tycher said, "We're also seeing a growth in demand from New York and New Jersey companies for corporate apartments." Ten such units have been leased at the Landings, he said, adding that he estimated that 20 percent of the 276 apartments would be rented to companies. Rents for those furnished apartments, which include maid service and garage parking, are $2,600 to $4,500 a month.
Roseland acquired the West New York property in 1995 from Mr. Imperatore, and last year it joined with him to develop the Weehawken site. Since 1980, both sites had been owned by Mr. Imperatore, whose vision of a Venetian-style city on the waterfront was never realized.
The current plan for the West New York property, approved by the town two years ago, requires, among other things, that the heights of buildings be at least 10 feet below the top of the Palisades cliffs. The units could be either for rent or for sale.
Roseland sold 11 acres of the property to K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, N.J., which has developed it into an enclave of 276 town houses, the first such development on the waterfront in this current construction cycle. Most of the homes, built or under way, have been sold at prices from $250,000 to just under $1 million. The homes still available are priced from $480,000 to just over $1 million, according to Hovnanian.
Mr. Tycher said that given the success of the Hovnanian project, the third community at Port Imperial North, where construction will start in October, will be a 12-story 180-unit condominium. In Weehawken, work is to begin in 60 days on 48 town houses designed to resemble brownstones that will rise near the ferry terminal, considered a critical amenity to the waterfront.
The Imperatore ferry company, New York Waterway, is seeking approvals for a new $25 million, 30,000-square-foot terminal. It will be constructed, beginning next summer, using government grants and loans, and, when completed, will be linked to the light-rail line under way elsewhere along the riverfront.
As the first rental neighborhood on the West New York property, the Landings, designed by the Martin Organization of Philadelphia, will set the tone, Mr. Tycher said. All the apartments, contained in four red-brick, four-story buildings, will have balconies, washers and dryers.
Amenities include a health club with a pool, as well as garage parking, for which tenants will pay an extra monthly fee of $100 to $150.

HEADLINE: Making a Belated Pilgrimage

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Lamenting the life of the Mississippi Delta, racing from an Appalachian hamlet to an inner-city Walgreens, embracing the vast desolation of the land of the Sioux -- these are unusual things for a President to do.
They are especially unusual gestures from this President, a self-styled guardian of middle-class interests who has kept a careful distance from the truly down-and-out. For years, old-fashioned liberals have urged President Clinton to embrace the cause of the poor more directly. 
 But as he finally heeded their advice, dashing from ghetto to hamlet to barrio this week to highlight the limits of American prosperity, his curious tour seemed to arouse an equally curious response: indifference, if not outright hostility among his natural allies.
"I can't help but be skeptical," said Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, though he himself undertook a similar tour just two years ago.
"An act of futility," wrote Carl Rowan, the syndicated columnist, in a column published today.
James Patterson of Brown University, a historian of anti-poverty movements, said, "I don't think this terribly exciting news."
Amid the river of dismissive reaction, it is worth mulling over an unconventional thought: It is possible that historians find more to praise in the Clinton anti-poverty record -- perhaps even in this mad-dash trip itself -- than meets the eye.
Some of the reasons for the skeptical reaction are obvious ones that relate to the President himself. It is late in his second term. He does not control Congress. He is armed with a modest legislative proposal. Tainted by sexual scandal, he is an imperfect leader of a moral crusade. And in some anti-poverty circles, he will never be forgiven for signing a 1996 welfare bill that imposed significant new restrictions on aid.
In addition there is a reflexive national pessimism as far as the poor are concerned. For decades, the world-weary prediction that the poor are getting poorer seemed a safe enough bet.
But the poor are no longer getting poorer -- not most of them anyway. And while until this week the President has avoided casting himself as an anti-poverty crusader, he has quietly assembled a long list of anti-poverty achievements. Their final effect remains to be seen, of course, as does the result of the welfare legislation Mr. Clinton prematurely insists on calling a success.
But some of his anti-poverty accomplishments already seem large, like his expansions of the earned income tax credit. Though it has a clumsy name and complicated rules, the program now distributes nearly $30 billion a year in subsidies to low-wage workers.
Others are more modest, like the Americorps program for volunteers. Mr. Clinton has also won significant expansions of child care, tax breaks for distressed areas called "empowerment zones," a modest raise in the minimum wage, expansions of Head Start, new school-to-work programs, and significant increases in health insurance for the children of the working poor.
Yet in most corners of the anti-poverty world, Clinton fatigue runs strong.
"One of the ways I preserve my mental health is to read as little as possible about Bill Clinton," said Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Harvard University and a leading anti-poverty authority.
That was Mr. Jencks's reflexive response, when asked about the President's trip. But five minutes later, he was acknowledging that he did see things to praise in the Clinton record. Adding his initiatives together, Mr. Jencks said, he saw a consistency in the President's attempts to create a kind of work-based safety net, with less welfare but more support for low-wage workers.
"To move toward a more work-oriented system will make it a lot easier to get things done for poor people over the next 30 years," Mr. Jencks said.
Though Mr. Clinton came of age idolizing John F. Kennedy, it was the style of Robert F. Kennedy he was self-consciously echoing this week. In the spring of 1967, Mr. Kennedy, then a Senator from New York, took a famous tour of the Mississippi Delta, where he encountered hungry children with bloated stomachs and open, running sores.
CBS News had its cameras rolling, and the combination of compelling footage and Mr. Kennedy's charisma, helped push hunger onto the national agenda. Though Mr. Kennedy won only modest expansions of anti-hunger programs before his assassination in 1968, a significant increase in the food stamp program passed a few years after his death.
Mr. Kennedy also made a stop at the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota in the spring of 1968. "All across America, people were watching that," Mr. Clinton recalled while visiting the reservation on Wednesday.
But these are the very gestures Mr. Clinton avoided until now. And three decades later, they inevitably carry a different cultural baggage. In Mr. Kennedy's day, it was possible imagine that Federal concern alone would be enough to provide a solution.
Now the country is less innocent -- inclined to believe Ronald Reagan's famous line: "We fought a war on poverty, and poverty won." Wary of being dismissed as a old-fashioned, naive liberal, Mr. Clinton has avoided bold poverty promises or even bold anti-poverty photo ops.
Until now.
In addressing the question of timing this week, the President's aides have said that the economy is finally strong enough, businesses are hungry enough, and the middle class is secure enough to push for a broader expansion of prosperity.
If the country does not act "at this time of prosperity," Mr. Clinton said, then "we'll never get around to it," and "we will have failed to meet a moral obligation."
But that was not enough to repair the burned bridges between Mr. Clinton and his welfare critics. Senator Kennedy's trip to the Mississippi Delta was staffed by a young lawyer, and devoted ally, named Peter Edelman.
In a later life, Mr. Edelman went on to become a welfare official in the Clinton Administration, and a deeply disillusioned one. He resigned in 1996, saying that Mr. Clinton's decision to turn the welfare program back to the states -- with less overall money and new time limits -- represented an abandonment of the poor.
Watching one former boss trying to emulate another this week, Mr. Edelman found much to criticize. While the overall poverty rate has declined in the Clinton years, to 13.3 percent from 15.1 percent, Mr. Edelman cited evidence that suggests circumstances among the very poorest have gotten worse.
And Mr. Edelman bristled at the President's talk of "pockets of poverty." With child poverty rates still hovering at nearly 20 percent, he said, deprivation is far too prevalent to be described as a mere pocket.
Early in the Administration, Mr. Edelman sent the President a memo, urging him to take up the cause of helping needy adolescents make the transition to adult life. He never got a response.
"He has never been comfortable in talking about poverty," Mr. Edelman said. "I think on balance, Bill Clinton has hurt poor people because of the welfare bill. This is just too little too late."

HEADLINE: Upbeat Data on Crime and Youth

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Despite fears about violence in schools, the number of children committing crimes or being hurt in them has been dropping since 1993, according to an annual Government report on the state of American children that was released today.
The report said the situation of children and teen-agers was improving and mostly hopeful, with the numbers of vaccinations and preschool enrollment up while those for teen-age smoking and pregnancies were down. 
 "The trend is in the right direction," said Kristin Moore, president of Child Trends, a research group. "We're sailing with the wind."
But Ms. Moore noted the absence of progress in reducing teen-age alcohol consumption or in increasing health insurance coverage.
The annual report issued by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics is designed to be a broad assessment of the state of the nation's children, a collection of statistics from across the Federal Government.
Lately, much of the attention on teen-agers has dealt with violence, particularly shootings at schools. But the report found that the number of serious violent crimes committed for every 1,000 children ages 12 to 17 had declined since 1993 and was now at the lowest rate since 1986. In 1997, there were 31 such crimes for every 1,000 children as compared with 52 per 1,000 in 1993, according to the Justice Department.
Still, in 1997 there were 706,000 violent crimes involving teen-agers.
Fewer teen-agers were injured or killed in crimes, too. There were 27 victims for every 1,000 people ages 12 to 17 in 1997 as compared with 44 in 1,000 in 1993, the agency said.
Part of the decline can be traced to the overall decline in all types of crime, which is tied to the strong economy, said Margaret A. Zahn, a criminologist at North Carolina State University.

HEADLINE: AFTERMATH OF A HEATWAVE: THE SYSTEM;
POWER SYSTEM USE IS PRESSING LIMITS IN NEW YORK AREA

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 8

 BODY:
The blackout that stilled upper Manhattan for nearly a day was a sort of distress call, a warning that as the demand for electricity sets records, the power systems in the New York metropolitan area are creeping perilously close to their physical limits, experts in the field cautioned today.
Power demand is rising faster than the systems' ability to generate and deliver it, driven by a booming economy and the proliferation of computers, fax machines, air-conditioners and the other amenities of an affluent, wired society. The more power is pushed through the cables, the greater the likelihood that some of those cables will fail. That lesson was reinforced in dramatic fashion on Tuesday, when demand climbed to records and power went out not just in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan and parts of the Lower East Side and Long Island but also in communities from Maryland to Massachusetts. 
 But in the long term, the increasing use of electricity poses a much broader problem. The New York metropolitan area, more than any other part of the country, runs the risk that in the near future, it simply will not be able to import, generate or deliver enough power to keep up with demand, the experts said.
The core of a solution to the problem, they said, must be the construction of new power plants, but those are a few years away, at least. There are now six applications before the state to build or expand plants.
The New York Power Pool, a consortium of the state's utilities, requires that each of its members be able to deliver at least 18 percent more power than customers are using at peak periods, and pools around the country have similar standards. On Tuesday, for the first time, Consolidated Edison, serving New York City and Westchester County, fell below that standard, to 17 percent. The Long Island Power Authority had just a 10 percent cushion, and Public Service Electric and Gas in New Jersey came within 5 percent of its capacity.
The cushion is intended to allow the systems to absorb unexpected problems like the loss of generating power or downed transmission lines without resorting to blackouts. In the latest heat wave, each of the three utilities was left with a margin of error that was one-quarter to one-half smaller than it had at its previous peak.
"The capacity problem in New York City isn't critical today, but it could be critical in a couple of years," said William J. Balet, executive director of the New York Power Pool. "And Long Island is in worse shape than New York City." As the margin of error shrinks, it becomes more likely that minor problems will lead to blackouts. And on peak days, the margin will evaporate entirely, causing still more blackouts.
On Tuesday, utilities from Maine to Virginia cut the voltage that they supplied to customers by 5 percent because their three regional power pools were approaching their capacity limits.
Public Service in New Jersey shut off air-conditioning to 145,000 homes whose residents had signed up to sacrifice their cool air in case of an emergency, in return for lower rates. The utility gives homeowners one hour's notice and is able to shut off units with a remote-control device. The Long Island authority persuaded local governments to shut down for the day.
In both cases, officials said, those measures were all that prevented rolling blackouts, in which power is cut to one community at a time each for an hour or two.
"We are approaching the point where more generation is needed in New York City to reliably supply demands in the future," said Louis Rana, vice president of Con Edison for system and transmission operations. Asked if the system had approached a crisis on Tuesday, he said, "I would say yes, we were close."
The problem is not unique to the Northeast, though it is more pressing in that region than in most of the country. In 1996, with demand straining the capacity to deliver electricity in the Northwest, the failure of a couple of transmission lines in Oregon shut power to parts of nine states. And last summer, utilities across the Midwest lowered everyone's voltage, pleaded with customers to turn off their appliances and persuaded some industries to shut down because demand was pushing the limits of the grid, threatening another major blackout.
New York City and Long Island have an added problem: the ability to deliver power from outside the region is severely constrained simply because the lines to carry it are few. Transmission lines from other places represent only about one-quarter of the region's capacity to deliver electricity; the rest is generated locally. That means that at times of peak demand, if there was a problem with the local power plants or the transmission system, the region would not be able to rely on outside help to avoid blackouts.
A few other population centers, like San Francisco, southern Florida and parts of New England, have similar limitations -- that contributed to the failure that blacked out most of San Francisco last December -- but none are as extreme as the New York metropolitan area's.
Con Edison has one of the lowest rates of power failure in the industry, and by far the lowest of any New York State utility. In power failures that struck the entire region in 1996 and 1997 -- one caused by a failed transmission line, the other by thunderstorms -- only Con Edison's customers were unaffected.
But as demand continues to rise, "the risk of events like Washington Heights, and of even bigger, systemwide failures, just increases," said Ashok Gupta, an economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council who specializes in energy issues.
Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said, "I think that this heat wave should sober all of us up to recognize that we have a really big problem, and we need to plan for the future right now."
When Consolidated Edison set a demand record of 10,700 megawatts in July 1991, it had a margin of more than 25 percent between that peak and its overall capacity of 14,200 megawatts. That record stood for six years, until an 11,013-megawatt day in August 1997.
In planning for this summer, the utility anticipated peak demand of 11,650 megawatts. Instead, it hit 11,850 on Tuesday, an increase of 20 percent over an average summer day.
On Long Island, in a system with a capacity of 5,100 megawatts, the power authority delivered as much as 4,590 on Tuesday, 9 percent above the record set in July 1998. And Public Service in New Jersey hit a peak demand of 9,794 megawatts on Tuesday, close to its 10,272-megawatt capacity, and almost 3 percent higher than the record set in 1995.
Energy experts say some combination of four solutions is needed: construction of power plants to keep up with demand rising 2 to 3 percent a year nationally; construction of new transmission lines to bring power into the metropolitan area; more aggressive energy conservation programs, and upgrading of the local lines that deliver electricity.
Power failures have long been a feature of heat waves -- in 1993, a large part of Brooklyn went dark, and in 1996, it happened in Queens -- because the "feeder cables" that supply communities become overheated as more energy is pushed through them and the ground around them becomes hotter. In many cases, the cables were installed a generation or two ago, for a less demanding market. It was an overload and then fire in feeder cables that forced Con Edison to cut power to Washington Heights on Tuesday.
"The more you have 10,000-, 11,000-megawatt days, the more you're going to have problems like this," said Larry Shapiro, a staff attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group who follows energy policy.
Con Edison officials say that the company is installing new cables with greater capacity and better insulation but that it will take years to replace them all.
For the first time in a generation, companies are seeking to build new power plants in New York, to take advantage of new competition. New York, like several other states, is deregulating the industry, abolishing the old utility monopolies and allowing power suppliers to compete for customers. Among the proposals is one for a plan on a barge moored off Brooklyn.
But completion of any of those plants is years away, and for now, the projects are tied up in a squabble in Albany among state lawmakers over how to draft a law on granting permits for new plants.
Mr. Rana of Con Edison said the utility was not considering building new transmission lines to import power from outside the region. New York, unlike many other cities, generates most of its power in the city.
But Long Island officials are looking into installing a major transmission line across the bottom of Long Island Sound to bring in power. Long Island is more isolated from the larger grid than any other heavily populated part of the country.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.
* denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
"COLLECTING IN DEPTH: DRAWINGS BY GROSZ, SCHWITTERS, ERNST AND KLEE," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9400 (through July 20). While a little on the dry side, this exhibition effectively encapsulates the careers of four major German modernists, layering their sensibilities like a sandwich and demonstrating the singular uses that each artist found for Cubism. In the outer layers, George Grosz and Paul Klee reformed the tensile lines and transparencies of Analytic Cubism for the purposes, respectively, of scathing social satire and psychologically charged fusions of fantasy and form. In between, Kurt Schwitters and Max Ernst took innovations of Synthetic Cubist collage into new territory. Schwitters used the detritus of everyday life to create a streetwise formalism that indexed different kinds of social interaction and human contact. Ernst extracted found images from their natural habitat in the public press to create a universe as fully imaged as Klee's, only scarier. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 5:45 P.M.; Fridays, 10:30 A.M. to 8:15 P.M. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith). 

* "SIGMUND FREUD: CONFLICT AND CULTURE," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92d Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Sept. 9). Having caused a fracas even before the plans for it were completed, this show is bound to attract big crowds. So be warned: this library exhibition, full of documents, requests that we stand and read much of the time. There are also text panels interspersed with family photographs, odd works of art and other objects (including the couch) that Freud owned. This is supplemented by video clips from films, television programs and home movies showing Freud, his sisters and associates. It's a basic intro to Freud, cleverly designed and geared to the public; it aims to be neutral, though it's a fair guess that no exhibition, no matter how judicious, could possibly satisfy his admirers and detractors. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 A.M. to 5:45 P.M.; Tuesdays, to 8 P.M. Admission: $8; $5.50, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
 
"GLOBAL CONCEPTUALISM: POINTS OF ORIGIN, 1950's-80's," Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through Aug. 29). This ambitious and groundbreaking exhibition of more than 240 works by 135 Conceptualists attempts to track a worldwide explosion in Conceptual Art production, a development whose significance has been likened to the development of Cubism. Divided among 10 geographical regions, from China to Europe to Australia, the show presents a huge but hard-to-digest mass of information and very few visually compelling works. Don't miss it if you like to read while standing up. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Ken Johnson).
 
* "HANS HOFMANN IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART," Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Oct. 17). A charismatic teacher of painting who translated his theories into vigorous practice, Hofmann (1880-1966) became a leader of the Abstract Expressionist movement. Most of the paintings in this show, the Renate Series, were made as a homage to his second wife, Renate Schmitz (1931-1992), whom he married a year before his death; the 10 paintings in the series went to the museum as her gifts or bequests. Both acclaimed and disparaged for their stylistic inconsistency, they form an anthology of the modes he worked in during the last phase of his career. Abstract but based on nature, they range from exuberant, fluent "landscapes" made by vibrant juxtapositions of color masses to a work or two of chaotic organization that misses the mark. But their energy and vitality are contagious. Hours: Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 8:45 P.M. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).
 
"IMPRESSIONISTS IN WINTER: EFFETS DE NEIGE," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 29). Think of the Impressionists and chances are you think green: lawns, hedges and fertile fields of a deciduous nature caught at full leaf. But these artists were year-round workers, and winter landscapes, rendered in the frosty open air or through the glass of a studio window, figured in their repertory. Here are some 60 such paintings. And if ever a show were tailor-made for summer viewing, this one is. Its size is untaxing, and its deep-freeze images of snow-covered fields and ice-caked trees are the visual equivalent of air-conditioning. Of course, much of the work by Monet, Pissarro, Sisley and their colleagues is extremely beautiful in that immediate, you-have-to-be-there Impressionist way. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Thursdays, to 8 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. (to 11 P.M. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $9.50; $7.50, students over 10 and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
* "THE MEDIEVAL HOUSEBOOK: A VIEW OF 15TH-CENTURY LIFE," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through July 25). Mystery still surrounds the vivacious 15th-century German manuscript known as the Medieval Housebook -- who the artists were, for example. Part idyll, part real-life manual for the landed gentry, the housebook touches on such miscellaneous matters as astronomy, astrology, courtly love, chivalry, mining, metallurgy, jousting, warfare, recipes, medications, castle defense, animal husbandry and the trapping of men by female predators. In its exquisitely detailed drawings, a mischievous mix of the elegant and the bawdy, men and women conduct lofty amours and earthy functions, the raffish mingle with the raffine, and sybarites are far more evident than saints. A secular sanctuary in a religious era, the manuscript captures, for an enchanted moment, the spirit of a world that's bygone yet very much a prologue to our own. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Sundays, 1 to 6 P.M. Admission: $7; $5, students and the elderly (Glueck).
 
"MEN WITHOUT WOMEN: PAUL CADMUS AS CURATOR," National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Aug. 29). This is the fifth in a series of exhibitions organized by distinguished National Academicians, and Mr. Cadmus's choice of theme is a natural. The male figure, often nude, has been at the center of his art pretty much from the start, and the show's opening gallery delivers a bracing hit of preening masculine pulchritude, from George Henry Hall's 1858 "Study of an Irishman" to a convocation of 20th-century Apollos. The interest level cools after this, but heats up again with a small selection of Mr. Cadmus's own work, including "The Fleet's In" (1934), a painting that mightily displeased the United States Navy when first exhibited and is on loan here from the Naval Historical Center in Washington. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 10 A.M. o 5 P.M.; Fridays, to 6 P.M. Admission: $8; $5, students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
* "NEW YORK COLLECTS DRAWINGS AND WATERCOLORS, 1900-1950," Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 (through Aug. 29). This superb gathering of 140 drawings from 73 private New York collections is the Morgan's first foray into exhibitions of 20th-century art. Starting with Cezanne and ending with Pollock, it skims across modernism like a train whizzing past wondrous cities, and yet nearly every drawing can prompt you to pull the emergency cord and shred your itinerary. Picasso, Matisse, Beckmann, Klee, Miro -- the greats look great here. But the exhibition never loses steam; in the back hallway gallery hang some of the best drawings you'll ever see by Matta, Henry Moore, Wols, Dubuffet and Freud. A complete feast. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Fridays, to 8 P.M.; Saturdays, to 6 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $7; $5, students and the elderly; children 12 and under, free (Smith).
 
* "EL NUEVO MUNDO: THE LANDSCAPE OF LATINO LOS ANGELES," Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 (through Sept. 5). For more than two decades, the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara has documented the process of physical change in the poorest neighborhoods in American cities. The story is often one of disintegration, but in the color pictures here he turns his eye on the largely Mexican community in Los Angeles, where transplanted cultural roots are in photogenic flower. Life is hard, but houses, stores and city walls are painted with vivid images of religious icons, consumer goods and yearned-for south-of-the-border vistas. Mr. Vergara's career-long project is an important one; this show is a vivid installment in his expansive field work. And it takes on an extra resonance at the Cooper-Hewitt, a former Andrew Carnegie mansion. Hours: Tuesdays, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Wednesdays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $5; children under 12 and the elderly, $3 (Cotter).
 
* "SURREALISM: TWO PRIVATE EYES," the Nesuhi Ertegun and Daniel Filipacchi Collections, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 12). The Surrealist collections formed by two friends fill the museum from lobby to ceiling. Although it has more than 700 objects, this powerful show is by no means a comprehensive survey but an intense, close-up experience of Surrealism that might be imparted by two obsessed acquisitors taking you on a personal tour of their treasures. Highlights include clusters of paintings by Dali, Victor Brauner, Magritte, Andre Masson and Yves Tanguy; a splendid group of boxes by Joseph Cornell; a brilliant selection of photographs rife with portraits by Man Ray; dozens of beautifully bound books, and remarkable drawings by Hans Bellmer and Masson. The show has notable omissions and a few surprising inclusions, but by and large the menu is gourmet. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Admission: $12; $7 for students and the elderly (Glueck).
 
* "URBAN MYTHOLOGIES: THE BRONX REPRESENTED SINCE THE 1960's," Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000 (through Sept. 5). The recent cultural history of an embattled, resilient, often joyous section of New York comes across here. The art, like the Bronx, is multifaceted, ranging from videos to sculptures to aerosol-spray murals. Photography makes a real impact in the work of Carlos Ortiz, Ricky Flores, Walter Rosenblum and Camilo Jose Vergara and the incandescent portraits by Sophie Rivera. Indigenous art, like graffiti, joins work made by Manhattan artists who visited or settled in. And the myths of fear and hope long spun around the borough are distilled in a fantastic domestic installation by Pepon Osorio, a version of which appeared in the 1993 Whitney Biennial. Hours: Wednesdays, 3 to 9 P.M.; Thursdays and Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $3; $2, students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
"0044: CONTEMPORARY IRISH ART IN BRITAIN," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Aug. 29). The work of 20 Irish artists living and working in London whose work sometimes addresses Irish themes and sometimes doesn't. Although the level of professionalism is uniformly high, most of the artists are pursuing familiar strategies of painting, sculpture, installation or video art. Look for Frances Hegarty's video self-portrait, Liadin Cooke's aluminum casts of small rough balls of Irish clay, Kathy Prendergast's drawings of the world's rivers and lakes, Tina O'Connell's installation pieces (which riff on Post-Minimalists like Robert Smithson, Carl Andre and Lynda Benglis without losing their identity) and Daphne Wright's walk-in environment of tall craggy outcroppings of aluminum foil, each accompanied by its own tiny foil seagull. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $5 (Smith).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
"CHARLES HENRI FORD: PRINTED MATTER, 1929-1969," Ubu Gallery, 16 East 78th Street, (212) 794-4444 (through July 16). This revelatory exhibition covers four decades of the busy career of Charles Henri Ford, poet, novelist, editor and publisher. It includes copies of Blues: A Magazine of New Rhythms, which Mr. Ford founded in 1929, at the age of 19, and of View, notable for its artist-designed covers, which he created and oversaw in the 1940's. But it is dominated by the less well-known "Poem Posters" that Mr. Ford made in 1964-65. These, in turn, are dominated by acid colors, chains of verse spliced together like a kidnapper's ransom note and pop culture images, Jayne Mansfield among them. They may be high Pop Art, but they are also the culmination of Mr. Ford's long involvement with Surrealism, whose strategies find new expression here (Smith).
 
JAN MATULKA, Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through July 30). This exhibition of harbor scenes presents Matulka (1890-1972), one of the lesser known but more engaging of American Early Modernists, at his most appealing. The paintings offer views of seaside houses, sheds and wharves, rocky shores, cozy, blue bays and chunky, toylike boats robustly painted in a brightly colored, chunky style that looks like a marriage of folk art and Cubism (Johnson).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
JOSE BEDIA, Ramis Barquet, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-9090 (through July 16) and Annina Nosei, 530 West 22d Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8695 (through July 16). The best works in this two-gallery show are visionary white line pictures made on shaped and unstretched black canvases. A pointy-eared figure at the top of a crystalline mountain grasps a great flying bird by the tail; a man warms his hands at a fire while a woman with flowing breast milk nurses a phoenix. Mr. Bedia, a Cuban-born artist living in Florida, condenses such fabulous narratives into luminous compositions of Art Deco-like elegance (Johnson).
 
ELLIOTT GREEN, JANE HAMMOND, DAVID TRUE, TREVOR WINKFIELD, Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050 (through July 26). Each of the painters in this well-selected show has developed his or her own idiosyncratic mix of Pop, Surrealism and figurative narrative. They harmonize well together, but Mr. True's big, zany cartoon version of the biblical Expulsion, with its eerie population of rubbery, incandescently hued characters, steals the show (Johnson).
 
JASPER JOHNS, Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331 (through July 31). Familiar Johnsian motifs are here embodied in prints from the 60's, 70's and 80's: the numbers 0 through 9 stenciled one over another; three versions of brushes in a Savarin coffee can; five expansive, hatchwork abstractions; a blotchy, black-and-white double flag; and the autobiographical suite "Four Seasons." Johns's distinctively deft, matter-of-fact touch animates them all (Johnson).
 
"LINEAR IMPULSE," Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082 (through Aug. 13). This crowded presentation of variously linear paintings and sculptures includes famous artists like David Smith, Mark Tobey and Lee Krasner. There are works in outmoded Modernist styles, like the Surrealistic Cubist paintings of Jimmy Ernst, but there are things that still look fresh, including richly layered paintings by Alfonso Ossorio and a dense ball of wire and glass by Claire Falkenstein (Johnson).
 
ALICE TRUMBULL MASON, Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through July 23). Descended from a prominent Colonial New England family, Mason (1904-1971) studied with Arshile Gorky in the late 1920's. As this selection of works from four decades proves, she remained devoted to abstraction throughout her long, under-recognized career. Her modestly scaled paintings, always rigorously structured, sensuously painted and richly colored, were influenced by Miro early on and later by Mondrian, but they always have their own engaging personality (Johnson).
 
JOHN McLAUGHLIN, Ameringer Howard, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 935-1110 (through July 30). McLaughlin (1898-1976) dealt in Asian antiquities and served as a high-ranking translator during World War II before moving to California and, at age 50, beginning his distinguished career as a painter of austere, Zen-inspired abstractions. This show presents five dry, near-Minimalist rectilinear canvases and a series of lithographs from which Peter Halley might have got the barred windows of his cell paintings (Johnson).
 
JUDITH JOY ROSS, Pace Wildenstein MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999 (through Aug. 27). Ms. Ross makes understated, uncommonly sensitive photographic portraits, especially of children. Among her lovely gold-toned 8-by-10-inch works are pictures of a blond, messy-haired urchin slouched at his elementary school desk, gazing at the camera with a look of heartbreaking ennui, and of a 10- or 11-year-old girl standing by a hazy lake with a Band-Aid on her knee and an ethereal aura (Johnson).
 
"WALKING," Danese, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 223-2227 (through Aug. 27). An unexpected variety of approaches to the theme of walking makes this an intriguing show. Among the 21 works included are pictures of Marina Abramovic walking the Great Wall of China, a gouache painting of a maze pattern by Richard Fleischner, a photograph of an attractive woman in a phone booth shot by the pedestrian voyeur Garry Winogrand, and Ann Truitt's striped minimalist column painted colors observed while walking outdoors (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
BARTON LIDICE BENES, Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Spring Street, (212) 941-0012 (through July 30). Mr. Benes produces modern reliquaries: broad, shallow boxes divided into little cubbyholes, each containing a labeled, more or less sacred relic. Among the items displayed in "Celebrity" you'll find a police badge worn by Sean Penn in the movie "Colors" and a wad of Dustin Hoffman's chewing gum. These devotional works are for a Warholian world where the gods have devolved into celebrities (Johnson).
 
ROSS BLECKNER, Betsy Senior, 375 West Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 941-0960 (through Aug. 27). The 10 new etchings in this show correspond to the large cellular abstract paintings Mr. Bleckner exhibited last fall. Patterns of luminous, blurry lines and glowing dots are Bleckneresque but the prints don't have the magical illusionism of the paintings (Johnson).
 
ANTOINE PEVSNER, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through July 30). This remarkable exhibition presents 120 drawings done from 1912 to 1956 by one of the original Russian Constructivists. Made in graphite in an elasticized Cubist style, they realize Pevsner's fantasy of Machine Age dynamism more persuasively than do his sculptures, which today look clunky and dated. Artists who continue to explore the possibilities of abstraction might find this collection a rich source of ideas (Johnson).
 
"SIGNS OF THE TIMES," American Primitive, 594 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 966-1530 (through Sept. 3). Quirkiness prevails in this fascinating exhibition of more than 125 signs ranging in date from the late 19th century to the present. There are pieces of elegant folk art, vintage professionalism and poetic vernacular, like a bent and torn sheet of cardboard with the scrawled words "I smile only from the truth. I don't wash car windows" (Johnson).
 
JOAQUIN TORRES-GARCIA, Cecilia de Torres, 140 Greene Street, (212) 431-5869 (through July 31). This show of small paintings and drawings on paper commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Uruguayan-born modernist's death. Torres-Garcia's gridded, pictographic works, by which he articulated a comprehensive cosmic philosophy with an unassuming, comic touch, are especially engaging (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
SAINT CLAIR CEMIN, Cheim & Read, 521 West 23d Street, (212) 242-7727 (through July 31). Mr. Cemin, one of his generation's most inventive sculptors (he was born in 1951) presents five marmoreal mock monuments, including a sphinx with a smoothly finished woman's face and a roughly carved body; an archaic, cartoonish horse pierced by a stainless steel spear, and a square wind-filled sail carved from a single block of stone (Johnson).
 
"CHANGING FACES," Jim Kempner, 501 West 23d Street, (212) 206-6872 (through July 24). A crowded, wildly diverse and rewarding selection of 74 contemporary portraits, including Robert Mapplethorpe's luminous photograph of a beatific Alice Neel; John Currin's ink drawing of a winsomely sensual girl; a skittery lithograph by Kiki Smith depicting birds, a cat and someone's sideways head; and tiny, finely made portraits of artists by Jim Torok. Look also for works by Elizabeth Peyton, Chuck Close, David Hockney and William Kentridge (Johnson).
 
"EUROPE ON A SHOESTRING," Weber, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 691-5711 (through July 31). This roundup of European avant-gardists ranges from the amusing to the oblique. Highlights include a Roman Olpalka number painting; Alghiero E. Boetti's enormous steel-framed window with the delightful title, "Nothing to see, nothing to hide," and Hans Haacke's "Photo Opportunity," which pairs a portrait of George and Barbara Bush at a storm disaster site with a portrait of a poor Alabama farm family by Walker Evans (Johnson).
 
RITA McBRIDE AND SYLVIA PLIMACK MANGOLD, Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, (212) 367-7474 (through July 30). Ms. McBride's installation focuses obliquely on the concept of the art exhibition. Three sets of curvy wooden bleachers invite viewers to sit and look at a picture on the wall, which will periodically change (first up was a Cindy Sherman self-portrait as a secretary from 1978). Ms. Mangold's Precisionist painting of a ruler on a wooden floor reflected in a wood-framed mirror and a more recent Cezannesque portrait of a tree echo the woodiness of the bleachers (Johnson).
 
B. G. MUHN, Stux, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 352-1600 (through July 31). Mr. Muhn, who was born in Korea and teaches at Georgetown University, produces crafty, surrealistic paintings combining abstract elements, luminous color fields and images that may be highly finished or loosely sketched. Mood ranges from portentous to absurd, as in the picture of a rabbit with a big pink tongue on a tormented-looking bald man's head (Johnson).
 
"SUMMER GROUP EXHIBITION," DCA, 525 West 22d Street, (212) 255-5511 (through July 17). This presentation of 11 Danish artists is remarkable mainly for how derivative the works are. Kehnet Nielsen's abstract paintings look like Clyfford Still's; Bjarne Werner Sorensen's layered networks are like Terry Winters's; Erik A. Frandsen's snapshot-based enamel picture is like a Gary Hume. But Michael Kvium's strange painting of paunchy men in underwear brandishing sock puppets and doing something weirdly erotic has an eccentric personality of its own (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
ROMUALD HAZOUME, The Project, 421 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 662-8610 (through July 25). The first United States show of this West African artist includes two dozen small, masklike sculptures made from industrial and commercial materials: detergent jugs, video cassette casings, electric fan blades. Mr. Hazoume is a deft and witty assemblagist of objects and ideas: references to traditional art, consumer culture and an economy of recycling are all touched on here. In the back gallery are seven airy paintings of oracular pictographic forms painted on layers of earth. A welcome debut (Cotter).
 
"WHEN TIME BEGAN TO RANT AND RAVE: FIGURATIVE PAINTING FROM 20TH-CENTURY IRELAND," Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through July 24). This begins with works influenced by Impressionism and Post-Impressionism and ends with routine versions of 80's Neo-Expressionism. Rife with derivative, overearnest work, it is most valuable as a reflection of Ireland's painful history and its effect on its art. It makes palpable the tensions between artists who wanted to keep abreast of international (mostly French) developments in art and those who disdained modernism and celebrated Irish rural life or the struggle for independence. Its high points are few, but include the work of Jack B. Yeats, whose thickly painted Expressionist works succeed in fusing distinctly Irish predicaments and states of mind with an original, contemporary style (Smith).
 
Last Chance
 
* "CROSSCURRENTS: MASTERPIECES OF EAST ASIAN ART FROM NEW YORK PRIVATE COLLECTIONS," Japan Society Gallery, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through Sunday). The strength of New York private collecting in Asian art is confirmed in this beautiful show. It begins with a heart-lifting 13th-century Japanese wood carving of the bodhisattva Jizo, protector of travelers and children, and ends with an installation of tea ceremony utensils from China, Korea and Japan. In between come paintings, porcelains and lacquer, all exemplary. A big, expansive accomplishment for the Japan Society. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $5 (Cotter).
 
"INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION," Curt Marcus, 578 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3200 (through today). The five painters in this exhibition work in various styles but are united by a predilection for painterly richness and conscientious craft. Included are Matthew Abbot's dazzlingly complicated Pop mandalas; Elizabeth Saveri's small, charmingly unassuming realist pictures; lovely, subtly patterned and layered abstractions by Dean Smith; luminous, crusty abstractions by Richard Tsao and lush grids by David Collins (Johnson).
 
BYRON KIM, Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42d Street, (917) 663-2453 (through next Friday). Mr. Kim likes to imbue modernist modes like monochromatic painting with oblique political overtones. Here he has created subtle, mural-scale wall drawings using gray washes pigmented by dust vacuumed up around the Philip Morris building, orchestrating a marriage of high formalism and low materialism. One wall bears the ghost image of a brick wall with blocked-up windows. The others are entirely abstract (Johnson).
 
* "TO CONSERVE A LEGACY: AMERICAN ART FROM HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES," Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through Sunday). The 200 works on view, drawn from the collections of six educational institutions and spanning more than a century, form a lively and eclectic gathering in which Georgia O'Keeffe and Romare Bearden, Edmonia Lewis and Arthur Dove, the ultra-urbane Charles Demuth and the ecstatic self-taught Minnie Evans keep kindred-spirit, all-American company. The exhibition serves as a lesson in the intricacies of art conservation, an introduction to the endlessly absorbing subject of American education and a richly deserved 30th-birthday celebration for the Studio Museum itself. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 1 to 6 P.M. Admission: $5; $3, students and the elderly. Admission is free the first Saturday of each month (Cotter).

SMITHKLINE TO CUT 800JOBS AT FIVE ANTIBIOTICS PLANTS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., Europe's fifth-biggest drug maker, said yesterday that it planned to cut 800 jobs, or about 1.4 percent of its work force, as it consolidates its antibiotics manufacturing operations. SmithKline, which makes antibiotics like Augmentin and Amoxil, plans to end production at five plants in Spain, France, Mexico, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Five others -- in Scotland, England, Belgium, France and Singapore -- will become the company's main antibiotic centers. The plan is part of a larger effort announced Feb. 9 to streamline operations and save more than $300 million a year by 2002 to compete better in the $300 billion drug industry.

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Urges Inner-City Investment

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
The new Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, went to Harlem yesterday to encourage more private investment in poor neighborhoods and announced the formation of a new mentoring program to allow inner-city entrepreneurs in New York to draw upon the expertise of large corporations.
Under the new program, a task force will be set up by the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, the city's leading business group, to match big companies with start-ups or other small businesses. Ten entrepreneurs will be selected in each of the next two years. "This is about much much more than money," Mr. Summers told a group of business leaders who gathered at Chase Manhattan Bank yesterday to share some of their previous mentoring experiences with him. "It's about advice, it's about networks, it's about the provision of opportunity, and it's about providing and sharing the types of knowledge that are necessary. In many ways, the money and financing are the least of it." 
 In his visit to New York, Mr. Summers underscored the same themes that President Clinton sounded this week during a four-day trip to Hazard, Ky., and other economically distressed areas across the country. Like the President, Mr. Summers said that investing in poor neighborhoods was not a matter of charity but made good economic sense. The Administration has proposed a new tax credit to encourage investments in what it calls "new markets."
The new Treasury Secretary drew praise from David Rockefeller, who participated in the meeting of business leaders, for coming to New York less than week after he was sworn in. Mr. Rockefeller said that the economic development initiatives taking place while the city's economy is robust represent a fundamental change that would continue in harsher times.
During a tour of the construction site of Harlem U.S.A., a long-delayed shopping center on 125th Street that is scheduled to open by Christmas, Mr. Summers seemed genuinely impressed by the numbers he was fed. Drew Greenwald, one of the developers, and Mark Willis, a senior vice president at Chase, told him that the complex was expected to generate $200 million a year in sales and $17 million in sales taxes, yet had required only $11 million in government loans. They said that nearby property values had soared to $75 a square foot from $30. About 500 new jobs are expected to be created.
"A lot of people are going to make a lot of money here," Mr. Summers said at the shopping center, whose tenants will include Disney, HMV and Old Navy. Later, he said that the financial leaders he met with had stressed that such investments are no longer relegated to special bank subsidiaries dealing with community development but are viewed as mainstream investments.
Some Harlem business owners have complained that they have been driven out by rising rents on 125th Street, but Mr. Summers said some displacement was inevitable with economic development. But, he said, "you'll see more vibrancy spread off 125th Street to the next streets."
Mr. Summers, who has spent much of the last six years assisting emerging countries, first as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs and then as Deputy Treasury Secretary, added: "We always say of countries that it's much better to be a country that capital is trying to get into than a country that capital is trying to get out of."
The Secretary did not allude to it, but the Harlem U.S.A. project is one of the few successful projects to emerge from the stalled Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a $300 million Federal, state and city program designed to spur economic development. Halfway through the five-year program, only $35 million has been spent on projects and administrative costs.
Other success stories were recounted at the meeting at Chase as examples of the kind of mentoring the new program aims to bring about. The task force is part of a national effort called BusinessLINC (Learning, Information, Network Collaboration). There are similar efforts in six other cities.
Fernando Espuelas, a former marketing executive at A.T.&T., said that the help he received from Chase and the New York City Investment Fund, which was created by Henry R. Kravis to stimulate job growth, had proved invaluable for getting his Internet business off the ground. "We are able to tap into networks of people that for a young company, a start-up, are just not available," he said after the meeting. His company, Star Media, which serves Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking Internet users around the world, created 200 jobs in New York.
Another speaker, Desmond Emanuel, who is black, described the difficulties he had in the 1980's getting financing for his construction company. What gave his business momentum, he said, was the help he got from the New York City Housing Partnership, an offshoot of the New York City Partnership that promotes the development of affordable housing. His company, Santa Fe Construction Inc., now employs 48 people, making it the largest minority-owned construction company in the city, he said.
Even now, he said, a relationship with a larger company would be useful. "If my business is going to grow to the next level, where I'm going to be able to take on more substantial private work," he said, "I think linkages with larger companies may be helpful."

HEADLINE: Reservists a Crucial Factor In Effort Against Milosevic

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN

DATELINE: LESKOVAC, Serbia, July 8

 BODY:
Beneath a sign for the Swing Jeans Shop, a dozen or so Serbian policemen in powder blue uniforms stood around tonight, glaring at locals who dared gather here for the fourth night running to demand the resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic.
All around the police in the town square, there were hundreds of Yugoslav Army reservists, some in soiled camouflage uniforms and many drinking beer. 
 They were home from the lost war in Kosovo, unpaid, jobless and angry enough to tangle this week with Mr. Milosevic's men, who call the shots in Leskovac, a city in a part of Serbia known as the "Red South."
On Monday about 20,000 people, most of them reservists and their families, filled this square and astonished much of Serbia by staging the largest demonstration since the end of the Kosovo war.
On Tuesday about 2,000 of them rushed the police station and vandalized the house of a local boss from Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party.
On Wednesday a drunken military policeman shot a cafe owner in the town square.
And tonight a thousand or so people, many of them reservists, milled around, shooting dirty looks at the police.
"The fear has disappeared," said Vlada Djordjevic, 31, a conscript who served for 65 days in Kosovo, while listening every night with his friends from Leskovac to American, British and German short-wave radio broadcasts about the war. "We were in the field and we could see that Serbian radio was telling us lies about the war. We believed BBC. And now we are not afraid."
In what appears to be a growing popular movement to force the Yugoslav leader from power, the wild card may well prove to be the Yugoslav Army and its reservists. In previous bouts of demonstrations against Mr. Milosevic, the army has either come out in favor of Mr. Milosevic or sat on the sidelines.
But the sudden anti-Government activism of reservists in this most unlikely of cities suggests that the army could prove to be a muscular ally, if fractious opposition movement can figure out how to use it.
The reservists' anger is not confined to this city. Demanding unpaid wages from the war, they have sporadically tied up roads and blocked bridges in central and southern Serbia in the last two weeks.
The principal object of the reservists' frustration here in Leskovac is Zivojin Stefanovic, the local chairman of the Socialist Party, who runs this down-at-the-heels textile town of 170,000. Mr. Stefanovic declined today to return repeated phone calls.
It was his house that reservists smashed up on Tuesday night, and it was his resignation that remains a non-negotiable demand of their demonstrations, which are scheduled to go on until he quits or is fired.
The reservists are also demanding the release from jail of Ivan Novkovic, a TV Leskovac technician turned local hero. Stunning local TV viewers, he sneaked his own videotape on the air last week. It called for the people of Leskovac to gather in the square on Monday and demand the ouster of Mr. Stefanovic. After a huge crowd did exactly that, throwing in the demand that Mr. Milosevic resign, the TV technician was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in jail.
What infuriated reservists about the local party boss was his mobilizing zeal for the war in Kosovo. Apparently trying to curry favor in Belgrade, Mr. Stefanovic organized the call-up of about 40,000 local men, according to opposition party leaders and human rights activists.
The bitter joke here is that as a result of Mr. Stefanovic's mobilizing passion, there were just two combatants in the Kosovo war: NATO versus Leskovac.
When reservists came home from the 11-week conflict in early June, they learned that the Government had not provided their families with food and household supplies, as the army had promised.
Nor have they been paid the $50 a month they were promised when they went off to war. So far they have received about a third of that.
"I am not the kind of guy who makes trouble, but we need those wages for electricity bills, for school books for our kids, for firewood," said Bratislav Stamenkovic, 37, a reservist who laid mines along the Kosovo-Macedonian border.
The reservists said they had also learned that there were going to be no jobs for veterans and that the local economy was in even deeper trouble than before the war.
The one thing they have not been told by local officials is how many soldiers from Leskovac were killed. The local Serbian Orthodox Church has an unofficial list of 70 names. Reservists say they will demonstrate here until they get an official number from the Government.
"In 10 years, all we have is war," said Pasan Cosic, 55, who was slightly drunk and very bitter in the town square tonight.
Mr. Milosevic has started and lost wars in the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, as well as in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia.
Mr. Cosic said he had been drafted by the Milosevic Government to fight in Croatia, where he lost a son and was wounded in the knee. Equipped with a plastic knee, he said he was later drafted to fight in Bosnia and then in Kosovo.
"We just have war, and I am getting poorer," repeated Mr. Cosic, a taxi driver who spoke to the crowd tonight from an open microphone that was made available to anybody who had a complaint against the Government.
"We don't have bread, cigarettes, sugar or cooking oil." he said. "I am asking Mr. Milosevic, 'How long can you keep this up?' "
Many of the reservists here tonight said they were well aware of the atrocities and theft committed by some Serbian fighters in Kosovo.
They said they personally had not committed crimes against civilians, a claim that, in general, has been supported by Kosovo Albanians, who in hundreds of interviews have said that nearly all the killings of civilians were committed by Serbian paramilitary forces and not by regular army troops.
But the reservists said that everywhere in Kosovo they were surrounded by Serbs in uniform carrying stolen televisions, satellite dishes and other electronic equipment. The scene was so familiar that it generated one of the best jokes of the war, said Mr. Djordjevic, the reservist who spent much of his war listening to the radio.
"So Rambo volunteers to fight for the Serbs," Mr. Djordjevic said. "In a few days Rambo is back in the States and drunk. Asked why he quit the war, Rambo answered, 'I couldn't carry a gun and a television set at the same time." '
There was nothing very funny, though, about the Kosovo war, Mr. Djordjevic said.
"At this point, what I care about is finding out who died from Leskovac," he said. "I don't give a damn about Kosovo."

HEADLINE: Slash And Burn Urban Renewal

BYLINE: By Robert Wilson; Robert Wilson is the editor of Preservation magazine.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
You live in a battered neighborhood in an ag ing city Buffalo or Baltimore, Hartford or Detroit. Next door or down the street is an abandoned house where crack is being sold or squatters congregate or fires are set. If you complain, the chances are pretty good that your local government will respond by tearing down the house, using Federal grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, special state demolition money or even city revenue.
Obviously an empty lot is a better next-door neighbor than a crack house. But what happens when the crack house moves across the street, then three houses down, then over on the corner, and local officials, eager to spend those demolition dollars on eager local demolition companies, obligingly follow? Soon your street begins to look like a Halloween pumpkin's smile. The lots become trash-strewn, and another ailing city neighborhood goes into cardiac arrest. 
 At a time when some of the news from American cities gives cause for hope, when many governments at all levels are solvent enough to spend their money to clean up even their worst neighborhoods, we have to ask ourselves whether these distressed neighborhoods are so bad that we have to destroy them in order to save them. I worry that we are moving too quickly and going too far in taking down abandoned housing. A decade from now, we could sorely regret the loss of sturdy buildings that we might have stabilized now at a fraction of the cost of restoring or replacing them later.
Although there's evidence that demolition is increasing, especially in Rust Belt cities that are losing population, New York is one city that doesn't have a policy of demolishing abandoned housing because rebuilding from scratch is more costly than renovating. Besides, much of the city's housing stock, from brownstones in Brooklyn to Art Deco apartment houses on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, is irreplaceable. "The cost of trying to replicate such buildings is impossible," says Bill Traylor, a senior program director of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a national nonprofit group that helps rebuild neighborhoods.
The city has committed $5 billion since 1986 to restoring its housing stock, affecting 120,000 units. Much of the money has gone to the moderate rehabilitation of existing buildings, but some of it has gone to reconstruction where multifamily buildings had been torched or become so decrepit that rehab was impossible.
As a result of this investment in existing housing, Mr. Traylor says, parts of the city, like the South Bronx and Central Harlem, which lost more than half their populations in the 1960's and 70's, are growing again. He points to a study done for the Local Initiatives Support Corporation that found that three distressed New York City neighborhoods have seen employment go up by 11 percent and the number of businesses increase by 13 percent since 1989.
Many other aging cities, however, have a plan of attack that seems to be the opposite of New York's. For example, Detroit got a Federal loan last year of up to $60 million for "an accelerated demolition initiative." Buffalo spent $1.9 million in 1998 to demolish more than 200 houses. Hartford has received $4.8 million in state demolition money in the past two years. New York State has earmarked $5 million this year and in 1997 New Jersey appropriated $20 million to help local governments tear down vacant buildings, including housing.
Many people defend urban demolition in places like Buffalo and Baltimore by saying that some cities are simply smaller than they once were, that they have more housing than they need. But when you look at the peripheries of such cities, you see that new housing is being built. The question is how to draw people to housing where infrastructure already exists, where density makes the delivery of services easier and where new construction doesn't promote sprawl.
As we know, the answers to these questions are complicated, involving at a minimum people's attitudes toward race, crime and education. But what can be said with certainty is that if there's too little housing in cities, people will live elsewhere.
New York City's success at beginning to revive its most distressed neighborhoods has many sources, both public and private, all of them related in some way to good economic times. But even in cities where times haven't been so good, where population continues to decrease, it cannot be smart to tear away at fragile residential neighborhoods. We may in fact be undergoing stealth urban renewal, a leveling of city neighborhoods that will appall us as much in the future as the urban renewal projects of the 50's and 60's appall us today.
Whether many shrinking cities will ever really come back is an open question -- unless we demolish the housing that people might have come back for. Then the future is clear, and grim.

HEADLINE: Working Hard, More or Less;
Studies of Leisure Time Point Both Up and Down

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
In a society in which the long lunch has gone the way of the screened-in porch and free time often seems as rare as a telephone without call waiting, it is surprisingly difficult to get a definitive answer to the deceptively simple question of whether Americans have more or less time on their hands than they used to.
The research on time-use yields evidence for three seemingly contradictory answers: Americans work longer and have less leisure time than they did 30 years ago; Americans work less and have more leisure time; Americans work roughly as much as they used to, at least on average. 
 "I could talk statistics to you from here to midnight," said Randy E. Ilg, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has generated its own share of befuddling results. "But one set of statistics will give you one point of view and another set of statistics will tell you something else."
A big part of the problem is that time-use researchers use different methods and different data. They depend on the indulgence and memories of ordinary folks (who, like everyone else, may be feeling they could use a day off). They study different time periods. They even have different definitions of basic concepts, like leisure and work.
But another part of the problem, some researchers say, may be that they have been asking the wrong question. The question may not be whether Americans are working or playing more but which ones are. As it turns out, there may be more people underemployed and, at the same time, more people overworked.
"What sense does it make to talk about averages if we have two very divergent realities?" asked Jiri Zuzanek, a sociologist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. Mr. Zuzanek recently edited a special issue of the scholarly journal Society and Leisure devoted to what some scholars call the "time famine."
"If there is a group of people who are overworked, and others are benefiting from a greater amount of leisure, and the trends are diverging, the average is not particularly meaningful," he said. "That's where I am a little concerned that reporting averages does not always reflect the dynamics of social change."
In fact, Americans may be working longer and have more leisure time. That is, some Americans are clearly working longer hours while others may have more leisure than past generations did. While hard-driving baby boomers may infatuate the media, many men have retired early and many people in their 20's and 30's have postponed marriage and child rearing or are having fewer children.
A 1997 study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on which Mr. Ilg was a co-author found that the segment of employees working at least 49 hours a week rose from 13 percent in 1976 to 18.5 percent in 1993. Among those most likely to work very long hours were professionals and managers, who were also among the highest paid. People in transportation and sales are also working more, although the reasons are unclear.
"When I first got into this, I said both sides can't be right," said Jerry A. Jacobs, a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania who set himself the task of trying to reconcile the contradictory views about work and leisure. "It turns out that it is logically possible for them both to have a kernel of truth because they are talking about different people."
Aside from people's personal fascination with the way they use their time, economists use the information to help assess the economy's long-term health and growth. Sociologists use it to trace, among other things, the changing social roles of men and women, tracking the time they spend working outside and inside the home.
It's quite possible that many people have an exaggerated sense of how long they work. The rise of couples in which each one works has created intense time pressures in families. Many Americans also have more opportunities than before and more knowledge of opportunities missed. Leisure activities are increasingly complex and organized. Meanwhile, E-mail, fax machines and beepers have muddied the boundary between work and home.
"Some people say the only way to make it work off the job is to treat life off the job like work," said James T. Bond, vice president of the Families and Work Institute, a policy research institute in New York City that has found that the average workweek is rising. "You have to apply good management skills and scheduling if you want to lead a normal life."
But when one tries to measure the time Americans spend at work and leisure, all sorts of perplexing questions crop up. If a person skips out of the office to run an errand, is that work or something else? Is commuting work? Should the work of 16- and 17-year-olds be counted? Are night courses work? When is shopping housework and when is it recreation?
The largest source of public data on work hours is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which regularly surveys 400,000 nonfarm businesses for the number of hours worked by production and nonsupervisory employees. It also surveys 50,000 randomly selected households, conducting telephone interviews about hours worked in the previous week.
The survey of businesses suggests the average workweek in the companies studied "trended down," as Mr. Ilg put it, from 38.8 in the mid-1960's to 36.1 in the mid-1970's, 34.9 in the mid-1980's and 34.6 in 1998. The household survey suggests the workweek went from 40 hours in the mid-1960's to approximately 38 in the mid-1970's to 39 in the mid-1980's to 39.3 in 1998.
Over the years, other studies have suggested divergent conclusions. F. Thomas Juster, an economist at the University of Michigan who surveyed Americans about their use of time in the mid-1970's and early 1980's, said he found that total work declined for both men and women and leisure increased between the mid-1960's and the early 1980's. He looked at not only paid work but housework, too.
In 1991 Juliet B. Schor, an economist at Harvard, reported in "The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure" (Basic) that time on the job had risen steadily over the previous 20 years. Leisure was dwindling, she said; manufacturing employees, for example, were working the equivalent of two months longer each year than their counterparts in West Germany and France.
Then John P. Robinson, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland, and Geoffrey Godbey, a professor of leisure studies at Penn State University, reported the opposite in "Time for Life: The Surprising Ways Americans Use Their Time" (Penn State Press, 1997). They said men and women were working less than they did in 1965 and had gained nearly an hour of free time a day.
In a revised edition of the book, due out in September, they write that further studies they conducted in the 1990's did not show a continuing decline in people's hours of paid work. Nevertheless, they said, free time continued to increase, in large part because the amount of time spent on eating and grooming declined.
Unlike Ms. Schor, Mr. Robinson and Mr. Godbey based their findings primarily on "time diaries" in which people were asked to record in detail how they spent their time over the course of a day, in contrast to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' method of asking employers about hours worked or asking participants to recall their work hours from the previous week.
Mr. Robinson and others say that people exaggerate their hours when asked to recall them from memory. The more hours they work, Mr. Robinson says, the more they inflate. Meanwhile, critics of the time diary method say it is biased in the other direction: busy people are too busy to keep diaries, so the method favors the unbusy, a charge Mr. Robinson denies.
Mr. Robinson, Ms. Schor and their critics and defenders have all sorts of other reservations about each side's (and everyone else's) data -- about the points in the business cycle when the data were collected, about the representativeness of their samples, about whether they were measuring time working or simply time at work.
"There are problems in measurement on both sides," said Andrew S. Harvey, an economist who directs the time-use research program at St. Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. "A lot has to do with the timing of the observations. Then there's a question of who you're looking at. If two of you were looking at slightly different populations, you might get different answers."
But many researchers also say the data are probably telling multiple stories at once, not only those of the undeniably time-pressed couples juggling multiple jobs and young children but also the stories of unhappily underemployed people perpetually searching for more work and of men in their early 60's who until recently were retiring at a younger and younger age.
"The one thing everybody agrees on is there is a time divide," said Robert Drago, an economist at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. "There is a large group of people who are overworked and there is an arguably smaller group of people who are underworked and searching for anything to get by. The question of whether, on average, people are working more or less is maybe not as important as this time divide."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Indexes End on High Note for a 2d Consecutive Friday

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
For the second consecutive Friday, the stock market finished the week with a hat trick, as all the three major indexes reached new highs. Bond prices ended slightly lower as the Ford Motor Company completed the biggest corporate bond issue ever.
Ford, and its finance company, Ford Motor Credit, sold $8.6 billion in bonds, including $1.8 billion of 32-year bonds that were priced to yield 7.529 percent, or 1.4 percentage points over the yield on the Government's 30-year bond. In a reflection of the recent strong demand for these and other corporate bonds, which offer higher yields than the Treasury market, Government bond prices managed to remain relatively stable ahead of and during the record sale. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day at 11,193.70, up 66.81 points, or six-tenths of one percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.86 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to 1,403.28. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 21.21 points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 2,771.86.
For the week, the Dow was up half a percent, hitting two new highs. The S.& P. 500 rose nine-tenths of one percent, hitting two new highs, while the Nasdaq index was up 1.9 percent, setting three new highs.
In the bond market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was down 5/32 , to 89 22/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6 percent from 5.99 percent Thursday.
The yield on the 30-year bond bounced around all day. It popped over 6 percent as some dealers apparently were selling as a way to hedge against losses if the Ford bond sale prompted a selloff in the Treasury market. It dropped below 6 percent as traders decided that the Ford deal was going well. But then it inched back to 6 percent as the afternoon wore on.
Both stock and bond investors will be keeping a close eye on the barometers of economic growth and inflation that the Government will release next week. Any hint of rising inflation -- which is not expected -- or acceleration in the pace of economic growth could send stocks lower and interest rates higher.
Wednesday will bring the report on producer prices, which could give some signal if the recent rise in industrial commodity prices is affecting prices. The Government's overall retail sales report for June will also be released Wednesday. Sales in retail stores rose sharply last month. On Thursday, comes the Consumer Price Index for June and industrial production figures follows on Friday. The University of Michigan survey on consumer sentiment will also be released Friday.
Speaking about the lackluster day in the bond market, Thomas Connor, the head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities, said, "The bond market wasn't going to get up and go because we want to see the C.P.I. number next week."
Equity investors will also begin concentrating on corporate earnings reports as the second-quarter reporting season gears up. It is the optimism about the outlook for earnings growth the rest of the year that is helping bolster stocks in the face of the quarter-point interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve at the end of last month and the possibility of another later in the year.
The two main compilers of corporate earnings forecasts are predicting a double-digit increase in the profits for the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's stock index. The First Call Corporation's forecast is an increase of 11.2 percent, compared with the second quarter of 1998. I.B.E.S. International's prediction is 10 percent.
Since Fed policy makers raised their short-term interest rate target to 5 percent on June 30, investors have been debating whether another rate increase will be necessary to curb economic growth and keep inflation in check.
The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to Fed rate moves, finished yesterday at 5.58 percent.

HEADLINE: The High Cost of Long Island Politics

 BODY:
Creating a fiscal crisis in a prosperous suburban county during one of the biggest economic booms in American history takes some doing, but the Nassau County Executive, Thomas Gulotta, has pulled it off. The county ended 1998 with a deficit of nearly $200 million, and is wrestling with another big projected gap this year. Its ridiculous property tax assessment system, which has turned challenging assessments into a local industry, is costing the county more than $100 million a year in refunds. In the latest blow, Standard & Poor's has announced that it is reducing the rating of the county's bonds to BBB -- near junk status.
Mr. Gulotta has relied on costly short-term borrowing to pay the bills, while inventing increasingly outlandish ploys to paper over a budget that is structurally out of balance. Earlier this year the county got a $70 million infusion of cash from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in return for accepting $240 million in long-term M.T.A. debt. Next, Mr. Gulotta hopes to borrow against anticipated future gains from the county's share of a national tobacco settlement. 
 Out-of-control labor costs, particularly in the police department, are one of the main causes of the county's problems. More than half of last year's deficit was due to cost overruns in police salaries and benefits. The county must also reform its assessment system, under which homes are assessed on the basis of 1938 construction costs and 1964 land costs.
The system is impossible to administer, one of the reasons the county winds up owing so much to homeowners for refunds from assessment appeals. Astonishingly, the county sells bonds to pay for those refunds, and its long-term debt has now ballooned to almost $2.7 billion. The assessment system has been decried by everyone from the county business community to the Justice Department, which says it discriminates against minority neighborhoods.
Like New York City in the 1970's, Nassau County is being run by a one-party political system that has become brain-dead from lack of new blood. In this case, it is the Republican Party that has run the government into the ground by spending money it did not have to keep political allies happy. The Republicans do not seem capable of reforming themselves and the Democrats do not appear to have the capacity to challenge them. The only answer may be an outside arbiter to put a spine in its fiscal policies.
The county could get some breathing time if the State Legislature approves a plan to raise the tax on property transfers. But the Democratic-dominated State Assembly is demanding a price -- giving the State Comptroller, Carl McCall, authority to oversee the county's fiscal practices. Republicans are unhappy with the idea of giving this power to a Democrat. But Mr. McCall's office has the expertise to do the job, and his duties would only entail forcing officials to do what they should be doing already -- engaging in long-term financial planning and keeping spending within the bounds of county income.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
They Sought Change and Found Death

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON 

 BODY:
It has been almost 30 years now since a night of deadly rioting in Belfast prompted Britain to send in army troops to try to restore order in Northern Ireland. Since then at least 3,200 people, many of whom were simply caught in the crossfire, have been killed. In "The Freedom of the City," whose evocative revival is being presented as part of Lincoln Center Festival '99, the Irish playwright Brian Friel tells the fictional story of three of them.
The conflict known as "the Troubles" has provided at least a subtext for much of Irish literature, especially that written for the stage, over the last three decades. In Mr. Friel's "Aristocrats," which is also being staged by the Gate Theater during the festival, and in "Translations," the plight of a people at the mercy of powers beyond their control runs between the lines. But in "The Freedom of the City," which concerns three ordinary protest marchers who accidentally occupy Derry's Guildhall and end up being gunned down as "terrorists," Mr. Friel openly addresses the strife that at the time of its writing had just come to full boil. 
 The play was written following Bloody Sunday in 1972 when British Army troops opened fire on protesters in Derry (or Londonderry, as British loyalists persist in calling it), killing 13. A British Government inquiry ended up exonerating the army, and the inquiry itself became a source of contention. But Mr. Friel, in an apparent attempt to deflect any suggestion that the play is merely an oversimplified dramatization of the Derry massacre, sets "The Freedom of the City" in 1970. The play was produced on Broadway in 1974 but closed after a week; not only were American audiences at the time so preoccupied with their own conflicted emotions over Vietnam and the resignation of a President, but also some felt Mr. Friel's play was little more than a political pamphlet for the Irish Republican Army.
That was nonsense, of course. But any playwright who tackles overtly political themes runs the risk of writing a sermon instead of a drama. It is a danger that Mr. Friel does not completely avoid in "The Freedom of the City."
But Mr. Friel is a master playwright, not a politician, and such departures into polemics are few and brief. The play's success rests with the characters of the three marchers -- two young men and a middle-aged woman who is the mother of 11 -- who find themselves thrown together in the unlikely refuge of the mayor's private office in the Guildhall and who slowly come to realize they are candidates for martyrdom.
This is no surprise for the audience. In a stunning and gripping opening scene, the lights come up on all three lying dead while a helicopter hovers above them. Suddenly a photographer rushes up and begins to snap their pictures. Then a priest scurries in and begins to recite the last rites of the Roman Catholic church. As this surreal tableau unfolds, the photos of the victims are flashed on a giant screen and a magistrate monotonously begins questioning a police constable about the circumstances surrounding the deaths.
The action abruptly returns to the police breaking up the march and the stage erupts in a riot, complete with clouds of tear gas, baton charges and fusillades of rubber bullets. Through the rest of the play Mr. Friel cuts back and forth between the live action of that day and the often grimly comic inquiry that follows. For the most part, there is little editorial commentary. Mr. Friel leaves it to the audience to ponder how the British military, the Ulster police and the news media could mistake three frightened protest marchers for a band of 40 armed terrorists or how a pathologist and forensic expert could so misconstrue the evidence at hand.
In one humorous touch the playwright brings on from time to time an American sociologist who attempts to explain the tragedy in a lecture, delivered in academic double-speak, on the nature of poverty and its ramifications in a society's culture. Mr. Friel even pokes fun at Irish sentimentality by having a balladeer compose an instant folk song about the three martyrs suitable for singing in pubs from Dublin to Long Island.
This is all made credible by very smooth ensemble work from the dozen or so actors in the Abbey's cast as Conall Morrison, the director, deftly moves the story along with the tautness of a well-edited television documentary.
As always with Mr. Friel, however, it is through the specificity of his characters' lives that the drama takes on poignancy. As we learn of the thwarted efforts of Michael Hegarty -- in a fine, understated performance from Gerard Crossan -- to keep a job, we begin to care more about the plight of the Catholic minority at the hands of the Protestant majority than we could from any recitation of unemployment figures. As we discover the circumstances that fostered the rebellion of Skinner, given an able if somewhat manic portrayal by Michael Colgan, we tend to be more forgiving. And as we discover the details of Lily Doherty's life with her unemployed husband and her 11 children, one with Down syndrome, all of them living in two shabby rooms without running water, we are ready to go out and march with her.
It is Lily, in an effective performance by Sorcha Cusack despite a somewhat nervous beginning, who emerges as Mr. Friel's true hero.
If the two young men represent the extremes of nonviolent protest and anarchy, it is Lily who speaks for the innocents caught in the middle. Lily may not be able to tell you why she marches, but she knows that something is not right and that she should be out there marching to change it. It is Lily, the veteran marcher, who knows how to get the tear gas out of your lungs; it is Lily who dies "overwhelmed by regret" but who also leaves a legacy of optimism for the future.
As she advises Skinner at one point about the nature of injuries from a police baton or rubber bullet, "As long as you can see blood, there's always hope."

HEADLINE: On-Line Grocer Is Setting Up Delivery System For $1 Billion

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 9

 BODY:
Only a month ago, Webvan Group Inc., a Silicon Valley start-up that sells groceries on line, was taking its first orders from customers. Today it placed a sizable order of its own, asking Bechtel, the engineering and construction giant, to build distribution and delivery centers in 26 markets.
And even as Internet deals go, the price tag was impressive: $1 billion. 
 Webvan, a privately held company based in Foster City, Calif., is the brainchild of Louis Borders, co-founder of the Borders bookstore chain. Though it trails on-line grocers like Peapod Inc. of Skokie, Ill., and Homegrocer.com Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., in coming to market, it has aggressive expansion plans.
It operates a 330,000-square-foot distribution center in Oakland, Calif., serving the Bay Area, and says it will begin operations in Atlanta early next year.
"Infrastructure is everything," said David Cooperstein, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "To do on-line sales the right way rather than the rush-to-market way they need to develop a very complex distribution system."
In groceries, profit margins "are so tight you need to figure out where the leverage is," Mr. Cooperstein said, adding that Webvan had determined that the leverage was in distribution.
Analysts say on-line grocery shopping is a tough market to crack because customers expect high quality and are unwilling to pay extra for the convenience. Grocery stores already operate on razor-thin profit margins without the added expense of delivery, and the perishable nature of many foods does not make operating from a central location feasible. By some estimates, an on-line grocer must do 10 times the volume of a typical store to be successful.
Yet William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive, has said on-line grocery shopping could account for a third of United States food sales by 2005. But Jupiter Communications estimates that the on-line grocery market will grow from $350 million in 1999, to $3.5 billion in 2002. That would make groceries one of the largest on-line commerce categories but still less than 1 percent of the total grocery market in the United States.
Today just one-tenth of a percent of groceries and health-and-beauty items are bought on line in the United States, compared with 4 percent of airline tickets and books and 9 percent of software, according to Jupiter.
Since its founding last year, Webvan has raised $100 million of venture capital from Knight Ridder, CBS, the Softbank Corporation of Japan and two of Silicon Valley's leading venture-capital firms, Benchmark Capital and Sequoia Capital. The company is expected to raise capital through the sale of as much as $1 billion in junk bonds this year, as well as a possible initial public offering.
Most established grocers have only dabbled in the on-line market, like Albertson's Inc., which is testing an Internet store in Dallas for nonperishables only, or Wholefoods, which ships nonperishable natural foods from its headquarters in Austin, Tex., and a few perishables from a site in Southern California.
"We think this is all good for the space," said John Fischer, interactive marketing director for Wholefoods.com, of the Webvan expansion plans. "We have a niche that can only benefit from the expansion of the market."
Unlike earlier Internet grocers, who relied on human shoppers racing down aisles to fill on-line orders, Webvan's operation is highly automated. Webvan opened its Bay Area service on June 2. Customers can place orders on line all day, seven days a week and select a convenient delivery time within 30 minutes. Orders are delivered the same day or up to five days later.
Chris Mannella, Webvan's vice president for marketing, said the two-year Bechtel deal would enable the company "to accelerate the national rollout we had planned." Bechtel, based in San Francisco, said most of the 26 centers would involve retrofitting existing warehouses.
"Our partnership with Bechtel is a major step forward for our company," Mr. Borders, Webvan's chief executive, said in a statement. "It accelerates our distribution capabilities, and it enables us to focus fully on our core competency, delivering a superior product directly to a customer's home or office."
Mr. Borders co-founded Borders Books in 1971, before selling it to the Kmart Corporation in the early 1990's. Since that time he has been chairman of Mercury Capital Management, a small investment firm, and a consultant to other companies. http://www.nytimes.com

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Heady Aromaof Recovery;
An Ancient Trade Propels Indonesia's Economy Ahead

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, July 9

 BODY:
On a clear day, Singaporeans can see recession-wracked Indonesia from their southern shore. From their living room, Seah Soo Lin and his son Jeng Jye can smell the archipelago's budding recovery.
Cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg and cloves: an aromatic bounty sits packed in a jumble of cardboard boxes on the floor. Outside on the patio, sandalwood chips are piled into a mound on a table. For the last 30 years, Mr. Seah's small family-run company, Chop Wee Kiat, has traded Indonesian spices and fragrant woods, buying in places like Timor and Sumatra and selling to customers from Bahrain to Tokyo. 
 Mr. Seah, seated in short trousers under a Chinese landscape painting, might seem unsuited to a discussion of financial market dynamics. Chop Wee Kiat, after all, is a tiny $5-million-a-year business in a local market estimated to amount to $1.5 billion a year. But for small players like Chop Wee Kiat, sticking with this ancient trade amid the latest financial storms has meant staying in touch with modern-day economics. Growing competition from distant suppliers and larger players, meanwhile, means relying on strengths developed through tradition.
"Nowadays if you want to survive, you must have a good reputation, be very active and offer good service," Mr. Seah, 65, said from behind yellow-tinted bifocals. "Experience also counts."
He has plenty of that. Distant relatives from Indonesia introduced Mr. Seah to the trade back in 1969 when they needed someone to broker the sale of cinnamon sticks from Sumatra. His depth of experience in Indonesia makes him sanguine today about what will emerge from the country's economic and political upheaval. "It won't be so different," he shrugs.
Economic crisis has in fact been kind to the Seahs and their Indonesian suppliers. When the rupiah plummeted last year, prices for Indonesian products dropped, too. That put a squeeze on manufacturers who were borrowing in foreign currency and had to import supplies, but it was a windfall to those whose livelihoods sprang from the ground.
And now the spice trade is pointing toward stability and hope for the future in Indonesia. Agriculture has proved an unexpected bulwark of the nation's economy, sheltering rural communities from recession. "The one sector that hasn't been hit is agriculture," said David Fernandez, a J. P. Morgan economist.
Agriculture alone -- representing less than 20 percent of the economy -- will not be enough to pull Indonesia out of recession. Further growth in crops will require money from banks, says Stephen Mink at the World Bank, and Indonesia's banks are being rescued by the Government under a plan the World Bank estimates will cost the country $60 billion.
Still, agriculture accounts for 40 percent of Indonesian jobs, and the sector's health has been crucial in containing the spread of poverty. Farmers outside the densely populated main island of Java have done so well that last year the World Bank declared the economic crisis a largely middle-class phenomenon. Jobless urbanites began filtering back to the countryside in search of work.
Now, economists say, natural resources, from palm oil and coffee to pepper and cinnamon, are helping Indonesia claw its way slowly back to health. Interest rates, once above 70 percent, have been halved. Inflation has all but disappeared. And in the first three months of this year, the economy grew from the quarter before -- not a real recovery yet, but a hint that growth may be around the corner.
To know the spice trade is to know a good deal about Indonesia. Traders have been carrying spices from these islands to the rest of the world for thousands of years, and spices have played a huge role in the nation's political and economic history.
Spices lured traders from Arabia, Persia and India, who brought with them Hinduism and later Islam. Spices supported a seventh-century commercial empire centered on Sumatra that extended as far as modern-day Thailand and Cambodia.
Arab traders long ago introduced pepper, cloves and cardamom from Southeast Asia to Europe, where they were treasured as preservatives and analgesics. Visigoths once ransomed Rome for pepper. The Arabs kept the source of their spices a secret, however, until Marco Polo divulged the truth after returning in 1292 from his travels, which included several months on Sumatra.
Once the word was out, Europeans started a race for the Indies, with spices inspiring the voyages of Columbus, da Gama and Magellan. Spices financed the expansion of shipping and sowed the seeds of empire for Spain, Portugal and England. But it was ultimately the Dutch who captured the true spice islands, trading Manhattan to the English in return for a tiny island covered with nutmeg trees.
Singapore's warehouses brimmed with Indonesian spices as the British port became a transshipment point and home to myriad companies like Tai Eng Ltd., which opened for business in 1948 on land now occupied by the Singapore Stock Exchange, according to the founder's grandson, Raymond Lee.
Farther inland, Mr. Seah's home office still has jalousie windows, and the only air-conditioning comes from a couple of fans. But the business brings in nearly $5 million a year, enough for him to raise six children, including Seah Jeng Jye, 32, who earned an accounting degree at Singapore's top university and then came to work for the family business.
Indonesia's troubles threatened to uproot Chop Wee Kiat's network of sellers, many of whom were among those Chinese-Indonesians who fled the country when mobs turned their rage against them. But after a week or so, Mr. Seah said, most of them returned home. "They go back because they can make money," he said, slipping back into his native Hokkien dialect.
With agriculture rebounding, markets for spices and other extracts are bulging. Consider Indonesia's patchouli. Cultivated predominantly by small farmers, the leaves of the patchouli bush yield a pungent yellow oil that lends a soothing fragrance to soaps, detergents and fancy perfumes. Aromatherapists say patchouli is good for treating everything from cellulite and athlete's foot to anxiety and snake bites.
Before the crisis, patchouli prices were at rock bottom and farmers had begun to dig the bushes up to plant crops they could eat or sell. But a sharp decline in supplies led to a rebound in prices just as the economic crisis reached its worst point. After patchouli prices jumped, farmers responded by digging up food crops to plant patchouli, and prices have fallen back to normal.
Adequate cultivation is no guarantee of supply, either. Early this year, so few goods were being shipped to Indonesia that exporters were unable to find containers to pack their products in. Banks were in such dire straits that they were declining to issue exporters letters of credit advanced to guarantee payments. When Chop Wee Kiat was buying nutmeg last year, Mr. Seah said, its partner in Indonesia had no choice but to ship the spice off and trust that payment would come.
Cloves are another story altogether. They are used in Indonesia's most popular consumer item, flavored cigarettes called kreteks. Encouraged by their success in cornering the nutmeg market, a group of ethnic Chinese traders decided in 1990 to do the same with cloves. When the plan failed, they enlisted President Suharto's son, who persuaded the Government to give him a monopoly on the clove trade. Companies like Chop Wee Kiat had to settle for cloves from Madagascar and Zanzibar.
One demand imposed by the International Monetary Fund for its $43 billion aid package was that the clove monopoly be dismantled. That reopened Indonesia's clove trade to Mr. Seah, but confusion has ensued. While the monopoly could not buy cloves, traders could not get the bank loans they needed to step in. Huge shipments of cloves were smuggled out (to the detriment of world clove prices), but most Indonesian farmers simply stopped bothering to harvest and dry their clove buds, said Suhas Chougule, general manager of Surice Trading Ltd., a Singapore spice company.
Lower prices for farmers usually mean fatter margins for traders, because the end market for spices is largely impervious to the boom-and-bust crop cycle, Mr. Chougule said. "People who use white pepper must have white pepper," he said.
Still, the role of small middlemen is under assault by concerns like McCormick & Company, a $1.9 billion enterprise in the United States that bills itself as the world's largest spice company. McCormick's buyers were once content to deal through local trading companies like Chop Wee Kiat. But the quest for greater consistency in quality and price has encouraged big processors to increase direct purchases from growers.
And the tumult in Indonesia has made the spice trade more volatile than ever, Tai Eng's Mr. Lee said. During the height of Indonesia's crisis, he said, prices gyrated by as much as 30 percent in two weeks.
Market prices are still determined largely by word of mouth. "There's no securities exchange offering nutmeg futures," Seah Jeng Jye said. It is not uncommon now for spice traders to enter into their own forward contracts, buying a shipment of cinnamon in June for delivery later or to simply stockpile a spice in the hope that prices will improve. Communications are evolving, too, the younger Mr. Seah said. Gone are the telex and cable; Chop Wee Kiat now takes inquiries by E-mail.
Modern ways may be coming, but spice traders hope the business is specialized enough to require their continued existence. Experienced spice traders can tell a bad clove bud by sight and can price sandalwood by how it smolders. "You need to have people who know about the trade," Mr. Lee said.
