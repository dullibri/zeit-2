HEADLINE: The Dance of the Cranes

 BODY:
Americans have learned to know two Bob Doles. One is the churlish partisan who can belittle as a "Democrat war" the struggle against Hitler in which his own right arm was shattered. Far more attractive is the other Bob Dole: the engaging Kansas Republican with an acerbic distaste for political cant.
Alas, it is Senator Churl who summoned a filibuster to delay or derail the Administration's economic stimulus legislation. President Clinton agreed yesterday to hear out legitimate objections -- but he was right to needle Senate Republicans, "who all have jobs," for blocking a job-creating program. 
 Because Democrats fell short of the 60 votes needed to end debate, the Senate can't act on the $16 billion package until it returns from spring recess on April 19 -- and probably can't act even then without caving in to Republican demands to shrink the already small package.
Mr. Dole as Senate minority leader thus denies a new Administration the chance it deserves to speed recovery and create jobs. Yet it is primarily politics, not principle, that drives this dance of the cranes, in which Republicans are preening for political advantage.
Senator Dole complains of inadequate consultation on a package larded with too much pork. There's something to this; the White House may well have mishandled legitimate questions about the relevance of $1.9 billion to make up shortfalls in college student aid programs and of a film on early Louisiana culture. But when asked what kind of compromise he seeks, Mr. Dole was frank: "Big one."
If anything, the stimulus package is too modest, given the weakness of the recovery. Yet Mr. Dole wants to scale down the package and, even worse, offset much of it by making cuts elsewhere, virtually guaranteeing that it will produce very little stimulus at all. He seems to be asking a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress to scupper the very program they were elected to carry out -- or else risk gridlock. It is the rightful role of the minority to oppose and criticize, but not to paralyze.
Senate rules permit unlimited debate, and on great occasions, dissenting lawmakers have resorted to filibusters, for good and bad causes. But to mount a filibuster so soon comes with particular ill grace from a defeated party in the early days of a new Administration. The American system, if it is to work, requires balance as well as checks; the majority has its rights as well as the minority.
In the hard reckoning that Senator Dole well understands, obstructionism for its own sake is often bad politics. For the most visible Republican in Washington to play a spoiler role can hurt his own cause even more than Mr. Clinton's. If the President's program is not given a reasonable chance to succeed, how can he be blamed for its failure?
Let's hope the other Senator Dole, refreshed by the recess, responds in better spirits to the President's offer to reach a productive compromise.

HEADLINE: Student Work Programs Take Us in the Wrong Direction

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In a shocking March 27 editorial, "A Prudent Approach to Student Work," you declare, "There is much to recommend a New York State requirement" that high school students be required to work as a condition of receiving their high school diploma. 
 How wrong can you get? Child labor is a serious blemish on our country today. America stands alone among leading industrial countries in the vast proportion of teen-agers in our work force. In Western Europe, as well as in Japan and other leading industrial countries, there is virtually no child labor. Only in America among advanced countries are high school-age children widely employed. Only in our country are truancy laws so weakly enforced.
Here is a prime reason American kids are failing to keep pace in math and reading with their foreign contemporaries. Here is also a reason American unemployment continues tragically high despite recovery in growth of gross domestic product. Unemployed adults should have the jobs now taken by high schoolers.
On any given day in Milwaukee, 30 percent of high school students are not in school; most have jobs. Many of those who are in school sleep in class because they work nights. Wisconsin students are probably less delinquent in this regard than students in other states, including New York.
Wisconsin studies show that the earnings of this teen-age labor are not spent on the necessities to help families secure food, shelter and utilities. Less than 2 percent goes for such purposes. Where does this income go? It goes for what parents won't buy their kids: cigarettes, booze, garish clothes, videos and, yes, in too many cases, guns.
Instead of a work requirement for high school diplomas, we need to impose stiff fines on employers of high school-age kids.
America provides a brief school year and much too short a school day, along with shamefully weak enforcement of truancy laws. And now you champion a requirement that students must spend more time away from classrooms to earn a diploma.
A Labor Department study estimates that this country can have more than 20 million new high-tech, high-paid jobs in the next generation if our work force can qualify for them. It also finds that less than 2 percent of our young adults have the literacy and math qualifications.
If you persuade the New York State Regents to provide a work requirement, and other states follow, your state and our country's future is in big trouble.

HEADLINE: Colleges Increase Student Fees Again, But at Lowest Percentage in Decades

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
The nation's leading colleges and universities have managed to hold next year's fees for tuition, room and board to their smallest average increase in two decades. But even at that, the increase at many institutions will outstrip the rate of inflation.
And Yale University will be the first to break a barrier that symbolizes the upward spiral in college costs. Next fall the university's total fees will come to $25,110 a year, or more than $100,000 for a four-year undergraduate career. 
 Costs will rise 5 percent to a little more than 6 percent at most of several dozen four-year public and private institutions surveyed by The New York Times. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9 percent in 1992. In the current academic year, the average annual cost at a four-year public institution increased 11 percent from 1991-92, to $2,253, and 7 percent at four-year private colleges, to $8,879.
Public universities cite declining state aid as the principal force behind their tuition increases. Private institutions cite their mounting expenses in variety of areas -- from higher student aid to salaries and benefits for staff and faculty, from higher energy costs to the growing expenses of maintaining top-tier academic programs and libraries.
 
Harder for Students
 "There are some very legitimate reasons to raise tuition," said Kent Halstead, director of Research Associates of Washington, which produces a widely used index of the costs at colleges and universities. "Tuition doesn't cover a student's education in either the public or private sector."
Still, many experts warn that the increases are making it harder and harder for middle-class students to go to college. Students have demonstrated at several campuses to protest rising costs.
And admissions officers say many students are applying to more colleges than ever to find out which ones will offer the most generous financial aid.
"Students realize it's a buyer's market in college admissions, and that means that they are doing more shopping and a better job of shopping than they have done in the past," said Stanley E. Henderson, vice president of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.
In announcing next year's increase in tuition to $18,630 from this year's $17,500 and its increase in room and board to $6,480 from $6,200, Yale noted that the total increase was the smallest in 20 years.
Howard R. Lamar, the university's acting president, spoke of "continuing efforts to restrain the growth of costs," and said Yale would keep moving in that direction while "committing the resources necessary to assure that all students who are admitted to Yale receive the aid they need throughout their undergraduate careers here."
For the next academic year, for example, the university plans to award $25.6 million in financial aid, a 13 percent increase over this year's $22.5 million financial aid budget.
At public institutions, the lingering effects of the recession have depressed contributions from state Legislatures to several universities.
The University of California, for example, expects to receive $1.7 billion for the 1993-94 academic year through state appropriations, down from $1.8 billion this academic year. The decline has prompted the University of California system to increase its tuition next year to $4,049 from $3,044. Room and board are expected to cost $6,103 next year, up from $5,761 this year.
"We have done everything we can do avoid cutting into academic programs," said Rick Malaspina, a spokesman for the University of California system, which has nine campuses. "So far, we have succeeded, but it has been struggle every year."
The story is similar in Texas. Hurt by a moribund economy that has led to smaller or flat appropriations from the State Legislature, the University of Texas system, after charging just four dollars for one credit hour for years, has steadily increased its tuition to its current level of $24 for one hour for in-state residents; next year, the rate goes to $26 under a formula that adds two dollars each year through the 1996-97 academic year.
 
Students Protest
 At public and private institutions alike, the increases have touched off debate, leading to protests from Syracuse University to the City University of New York to San Diego State. Stacey Leyton, president of the United States Students Association, a lobbying group that represents 3.5 million college students, said the institutions could not justify fee increases that were double the rate of inflation. And she noted that not all of the tuition increases went exclusively for a student's education but went instead to help finance construction of football stadiums and research laboratories.
But Lyn Hutton, the vice president and treasurer at Dartmouth College, said institutions were spending much more on labor, a component that accounts for a small part of the Consumer Price Index. A better measure is the Higher Education Price Index, which calculates the cost of salaries and compensation, library books and subscriptions and other expenses.
The index was designed by the Federal Government 30 years ago and is now maintained by the private Research Associates of Washington. Over the last 10 years, according to research by Harvard University, the compounded rate of the Consumer Price Index rose by 4.1 percent compared with 5.2 percent for the Higher Education Price Index, although several university officials say this is unlikely to quiet the criticism.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 10, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about college fee increases for the 1993-94 academic year referred incorrectly to student protests about them. Students at the City University of New York protested college expenses two years ago, not this year.

HEADLINE: Kazakhstan And Chevron Start Venture

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES

 BODY:
The Chevron Corporation and the Republic of Kazakhstan officially established a $20 billion joint oil venture yesterday that industry officials and analysts view as a a bellwether for other American oil companies wanting to do business in the former Soviet Union.
The 50-50 joint venture will generate modest revenues and profits for San Francisco-based Chevron in its first few years, analysts said. "In the long term it will add more than $1 a share in earnings," said Eugene Nowak, a senior oil analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. "This is a mega-venture." Chevron earned $1.57 billion, or $4.63 a share, in 1992. 
 Wall Street gave its blessing to yesterday's formal signing of the deal in Kazakhstan, pushing Chevron stock up $1 to close at $84.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Huge Undeveloped Resources
 The joint venture, which was agreed to last May but delayed twice, is the largest so far between a Western oil company and a former Soviet republic. Other American oil and gas producers have expressed interest in investing in the former Soviet Union, which has some huge but largely undeveloped fields. Many potential investors have, however, been waiting for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States to open their doors to Western investment, as Kazakhstan apparently now has.
"It's certainly a bellwether deal" in the former Soviet Union, said David O'Reilly, Chevron's vice president of strategic planning. "The reason we were the first to close a big deal is that we started early. It took a lot of patience and perseverance by all parties."
The project is also the largest international deal for San Francisco-based Chevron in the last 20 years, following ventures in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, Mr. O'Reilly said in a telephone interview from San Francisco.
The joint venture company, called Tengizchevroil, or TCO, will be owned by Tengizneftegaz, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's national oil company, and the Chevron Overseas Company, a unit of Chevron's international exploration and production subsidiary.
Chevron will receive 20 percent of the income generated over the life of the project, while Kazakhstan will get the rest.
The joint venture will develop the huge Tengiz and Korolev oilfields on the northeastern coast of the Caspian Sea. The Tengiz field, one of the largest discovered in the last decade, is more than twice the size of the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska.
 
Big Potential Is Seen
 TCO expects the Tengiz field to produce more than 700,000 barrels a day by 2010. The field, located in a barren region with a harsh climate, now produces about 65,000 barrels a day and is estimated to hold about 25 billion barrels of oil. About six billion to nine billion barrels can be recovered, Chevron said.
The venture plans to invest more than $1.5 billion to develop the field over three to five years. It also must build a pipeline to handle the increased production.
Mr. O'Reilly said the oil in the Tengiz field was high quality, but was fairly deep -- more than 10,000 feet underground -- and was under high pressure and contained sulfur. TCO's investment will include adding an unknown number of plants to process the oil and remove the sulfur.
Chevron, Russia and Kazakhstan have agreed that the oil from the Tengiz field can be transported through Russia to ports for export.
 
Payments to Government

 
 Under the financial terms of the 40-year venture, TCO will pay the Government of Kazakhstan bonuses, taxes and royalties and $50 million for regional development.
The agreement comes after more than five years of discussions about the project and could signal the willingness of former Soviet republics to allow Western companies to help develop natural resources and shore up their sagging economies with hard currency, analysts said.
"It's a sign to all parties that something like this can be developed," Mr. Nowak said.

HEADLINE: Big Bills Coming Due at H.U.D., Crimping Expansion of Programs

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Several old bills are coming due at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the costs are frustrating the Clinton Administration's hopes of rapidly expanding Federal housing aid.
A combination of new laws, old decisions, deferred expenses, poor management, and the quirks of Federal accounting are forcing the department to seek tens of billions of dollars in expanded budget authority over the next few years just to house the families it is now assisting. 
 This reduces its ability to offer rent subsidies to the millions of families that qualify for aid but are forced to wait as long as a decade because of the lack of Government financing.
Only part of the ballooning ledger represents new annual expenses. A larger portion stems from bookkeeping rules that require the department to account in a single year for money that will be spent over several years.
But taken together, the numbers to be released Thursday when President Clinton offers his budget for the fiscal year 1994 present a gloomy fiscal forecast for Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. The bad news comes after 12 years in which Democrats promised to reverse Republican housing policies they blamed for homelessness and urban distress.
"Just to keep the same number of families housed continues to cost more money into the future," said Herb Persil, the department's budget director. "If you want to add additional families, that just adds to the problem."
The General Accounting Office, a Congressional arm not noted for its florid language, recently warned that the financial pressures "will only worsen an already dismal situation." Last summer, a Senate Appropriations subcommittee called the figures "staggering."
The sudden fiscal constraints come after two decades of worsening conditions for low-income renters. Though Federal housing assistance has been expanding, the number of needy renters has been growing even faster.
The department provides aid to about 4.5 million families, either through conventional public housing or programs that subsidize families living in private apartments.
But the department estimates that as many as 13 million more families qualify for housing assistance, which unlike cash welfare or food stamps is limited each year by Congressional appropriations.
And about 5.1 million of those families are considered to have "worst case needs." This means their annual household incomes fall below ceilings that, depending on the city, average about $19,000 for a family of four. In addition, these families live in "severely substandard" conditions or spend more than half their income on rent and utilities.
"The amount we need is far beyond what we're going to be able to get in the foreseeable future," said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, a housing expert.
 
The Bookkeeping Problem
 Much of the budgetary concern centers on the department's Section 8 program, which provides subsidies to 2.7 million families living in private apartments. The families pay 30 percent of their income on rent, and the Government pays landlords an additional stipend, pegged to local housing costs.
When the program began in the mid-1970's, the Government financed it mostly through 15-year contracts, which have begun to expire in large numbers. Federal budgeting rules require that the entire multi-year cost of a contract be charged against the department's budget in the year it is renewed, although the money is actually spent over several years.
Five years ago, none of the department's budget authority went toward renewing old contracts. Now about $7 billion of H.U.D.'s $25 billion budget in the current fiscal year is allotted to the renewals, and the department expects that figure to grow to more than $15 billion by 1997. To reduce the cost of the contracts, H.U.D. has shortened their length to five years. As a result, the department will soon have to begin renewing its renewals.
Mr. Frank, among others, argues that such numbers are largely an accounting problem that exaggerates the situation. While H.U.D.'s budget authority will have to grow by leaps and bounds over the next few years to renew the contracts, the actual spending in any given year remains steady, rising only in rough step with inflation. "Can we find the budget authority? Yeah," he said.
But some housing experts take a different view, saying the need for budget authority throws H.U.D. into fierce competition with other, more popular agencies. "It's a major problem," said Cushing N. Dolbeare, a housing consultant and longtime advocate for low-income housing.
Under current law, the Government's overall budget authority is capped every year, meaning increases at H.U.D. must come from decreases elsewhere. The law expires in 1995, giving Congress the chance to write in new assumptions that account for the expiring contracts.
 
'Preserving' Cheap Housing
 A second area costing the Government large new sums involves what are called "preservation properties," referring to hundreds of thousands of apartments for low-income families built beginning in the late 1960's with Government-subsidized loans.
The programs gave developers the option of paying off their mortgages after 20 years, leaving them free to displace low-income renters and charge market rates. When it became clear by 1990 that many developers intended to do just that, Congress passed a law that barred owners from raising the rents. But it compensated them with new subsidies.
The result is that H.U.D. must spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year in new payments to landlords, simply to preserve the existing units as low income. H.U.D. forecasters have said the cost could reach $750 million next year; the Congressional Budget Office has said the program could cost the department $4 billion over the next three years.
A third area of concern involves the backlog of renovation needed in the nation's 1.4 million units of conventional public housing. Some of the apartments are now 50 years old, and they need significant repairs. About 100,000 are too decrepit for habitation.
In 1985, a consulting company hired by H.U.D. estimated it would cost $22 billion to bring the apartments into line with housing codes. Last year, the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing, which was appointed by Congress, increased the estimate to $27 billion -- more than H.U.D.'s entire annual budget.
Repairing the units would bring sharp new annual costs. The transition report prepared for Mr. Cisneros emphasized the "significant gap" between the $5 billion a year that the commission said was needed, and the $3.1 billion now being spent. But without adequate repairs, more units are likely to fall vacant.
 
Costs of Foreclosed Property
 H.U.D. faces a fourth area of increased costs in its management of repossessed apartments whose owners have failed to pay insured mortgages. H.U.D. now manages 48,000 such apartments, which it is trying to resell to private owners. The transition report said the department would need to increase subsidies by $2 billion to make the apartments attractive to new investors, and it warned that poor management was "dramatically increasing holding costs."
The increased expenses come after two decades in which the number of needy families grew sharply because the incomes of the poorest workers have fallen while housing costs have risen.
Government assistance has continued to expand in the past decade, when it became a subject of great ideological strife, but the pace of expansion slowed. At the end of the 1970's, the Government was expanding assistance by about 300,000 families a year, a figure which fell to about 55,000 under the first Reagan budgets and grew to about 85,000 in the past several years.
Mr. Cisneros has said he would like to increase that number to about 100,000 families a year. But Ms. Dolbeare notes that at that pace it would take 51 years to house the 5.1 million families on the department's list of the most needy.

HEADLINE: To Crystal, 12, School Serves No Purpose

SERIES: Children of the Shadows: The third of ten lives of the city.

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Crystal Rossi wears two streaks of bright magenta in her hair. They hang, stains of Kool-Aid, down her loose, long strands of blond like a seventh grader's twist of punk: Don't come too close. Don't mess with me. Don't tell me what to do. I'm not like you.
At her Brooklyn public school, a kaleidoscope of teen-age rage, Crystal's teachers see a young girl with an attitude. They focus on her slouch, her Kool-Aid streaks, her grunge clothes and sullen anger and see all the signs of trouble. But those vivid slashes say the most, communicating a basic paradox of adolescence, the double-edged message: "bug off" and "LOOK AT ME." 
 This is the time, this tender age of 12, when every major decision on the treacherous road to adulthood looms. It is also the time, in the sixth and seventh grades, when some students start a long, slow fall away from school.
 
'The Classes Are Boring'
 On the surface, Crystal hardly seems the sort of child who would stumble.
Her family is stable. Her stepfather works. Her mother takes care of the home. Her father lives just blocks away. Her school is typical, chaotic, underfinanced and overcrowded, but it is clean and relatively safe.
But in a competition between the street and her Bensonhurst school, the street seems to be winning.
"The classes are boring!" Crystal exploded one afternoon. "And the teachers are mean!" Her eyes downcast, she complained that too much class time was spent on discipline. "They are always yelling," she said. "I wish they would all just shut up."
Her face to the world is one of toughness. But in fact she is a child trying to navigate a difficult and often lonely road. In a whisper one day, her head cast down and fingers playing across a desk top, she admitted that she was often nervous.
"Sometimes I can't even sleep," she said. "I stay up all night, and then I'm too tired to get up in the morning."
She rarely allows herself to express such vulnerability. Instead, she tends toward bravado; in a rare moment of exuberance she tells her mother that she is a "leader" who sets the pace in school. Her mother does not buy it. "No," her mother says as she shakes her head. "You are a follower."
Such deflations are consistent. What is absent is a quiet, steady voice of encouragement, a single figure to lead Crystal through the minefields of a childhood in Bensonhurst. Pressures abound, applied by teachers, parents and even friends, but Crystal seems without a touchstone to guide her and give her a sense of her potential.
At home, three other daughters occupy her mother's time and worry. Crystal's sister, Colette, 15, is failing the ninth grade. Her halfsisters, Candice, 5, and Jovan, 2, demand attention and dominate family life, especially when their dad comes home and lifts them in a warm embrace. Crystal, lonely and lackluster, hides in plain sight.
Crystal says she wants to be a lawyer. But she has never actually met a lawyer and is now flunking most of her classes. That career appeals because, she says, "you get to talk back to people" and "you make a lot of money."
Her teachers worry that she might not even make it to her high school graduation. They already see the signs. In class she ducks competition and is losing focus. Outside of school hers is a childhood of temptations and dangers: drugs, alcohol, gangs and older kids who linger on street corners wanting everything from sex to the coat off a 12-year-old's back.
There was a fleeting moment when Crystal's academic future seemed full of promise. Her 34-year-old mother, Colleen Ficalora, said Crystal was once slated for a kindergarten for gifted students, "but she would have had to take a bus." Now, in the seventh grade at the Joseph B. Cavallaro Junior High School in Bensonhurst, Crystal is often restless, angry and tuned out.
Mrs. Ficalora wants Crystal to break a family pattern. Not one of her own 14 brothers and sisters graduated from high school. Neither did she. Nor did Crystal's father or stepfather. If Crystal gets her diploma she will stand apart.
At school, some teachers are trying to help. But sitting in one class, a "resource room" tailored to give troubled students individual attention, Crystal slumped on her desk. "We just sit there," she said later. "They are supposed to help you with stuff you don't understand. But I understand everything so I just sit there."
"Kids who study are all nerds," she said dismissively. "Who'd want to be like that? Everybody makes fun of them."
But the kids make fun of one another for failing, too.
"Stooopid," Crystal taunted a friend in the resource room one morning.
"No, you're stupid, stupid," the girl retorted.
"No. You. You're stupid," Crystal shot back, her head resting on her desk top.
Most days, Crystal says, she is usually happy only at lunch, when she and her friends bend over pizza and sandwiches "just talking." The time brings them together, jostling and punching and trading stories of their day. Sometimes they vanish into a bathroom and plant thick lipstick kisses -- perfect O's -- on one another's foreheads. Their mark of solidarity against a world too often hostile.
 
The School
Clean Halls,
Crowded Classes
Of the 950 or so students at Cavallaro Junior High School on any given day, says Rose P. Molinelli, the principal, 300 or more are at risk of everything from dropping out to doping up to slashing their wrists and watching their lives literally drain right out of them. One of the school's seventh-grade classes last year had five suicide attempts. This year has been quieter, but the threats remain.
"You can walk out this door any afternoon and get hurt," Mrs. Molinelli said as she stooped on a busy stairwell to scoop up a bit of litter. Other pressures are subtler.
"The kids all know who is abused and who is having trouble at home and who is in a gang," Mrs. Molinelli said. "They know who gets high. They know who gets killed. It gets to them. I think all kids today are at risk. And parents are overwhelmed. A lot of kids get lost."
Three years ago Cavallaro, on 24th Avenue and Cropsey Avenue, was a place where gangs lurked in hallways and teachers lived in fear. Then Mrs. Molinelli came, the gangs were banished and a new sense of order was imposed. Today the halls are clean and orderly and, unlike the local high school where a metal detector was recently installed to screen out guns and knives, students can move about with a sense of ease and safety. A guard monitors everyone entering and leaving the building, and Mrs. Molinelli herself quizzes every child she finds wandering the hallways during class time.
Crystal glides through the environment as though untouched. When a fight breaks out in the hall, she slips around the corner. But privately, she whispers about the gangs, the kids who have been robbed or hurt or are threatened by bullies, and of friends with "troubles" at home.
"I know a kid who just got shot," she said starkly. "He got shot and he is dead."
Mrs. Molinelli changed the school hours -- ending the day a half-hour earlier -- to let her students out before the local high school students have a chance to victimize the younger children. Other problems are more intractable.
Classes run at or near their maximum of 30 children each, and teachers have to struggle just to keep order, much less provide individual attention. Budget cuts have whittled resources, and although Mrs. Molinelli says her teachers have come up with creative ways to compensate for the shortages, she knows the children could use more.
"We're on the edge," she said. "We're already on the edge and now they are talking about more funding cuts. Right now, we've only got one guidance counselor for 700 students. That's not enough."
Crystal's schedule includes one-on-one tutoring in a "rap class" where Cathy Searao, a school drug counselor, spends time talking with troubled students partly as a mentor and partly as a friend. Shrugging, embarrassed and monosyllabic, Crystal says she likes the program because there "the teacher really talks to you." One afternoon Ms. Searao taught Crystal and a friend how to develop film. It was the one moment in her school day when Crystal smiled. She shyly admits that she also enjoys science and a dance program she goes to after school.
Mrs. Molinelli would like to see more individualized programs in the school. But in the meantime, she fights cutbacks.
Crystal's mother wants more from the public school as well. "I feel like I try my hardest," she said, "but I still need someone there education-wise who can back me up."
 
The Home
Without a Beacon,
Losing Direction
Early on a wintry afternoon, teachers chatted about the bitter cold and a new problem it had spawned. Some students arrived in class wearing ski masks and it was scaring the staff stiff. A warning went out over the public-address system: Henceforth, ski masks were forbidden. It was too unnerving for the teachers not to be able to identify potential assailants.
In science, as a substitute teacher tried to teach the difference between fact and opinion, Crystal spent her time, lipstick in one hand, a mirror in the other, tracing steaks of red along her lips.
The toll of her inattention is already becoming all too clear. In the first semester, Crystal passed every major class but science. But as the school year progressed, she started drifting. In September Crystal made her way to class on time on every day but one. In January she was late 12 days out of 20.
Her mother says it is a constant battle just to get Crystal up and out. As she and her husband begin the day, the tone is set.
"I start trying to wake her up at 7 A.M.," Mrs. Ficalora said. "By 7:30, I am really screaming."
Crystal's February report card included a 65 in social studies. She failed English, math, science, foreign language and physical education. "We have already sent the family an 'at risk' letter," said Diane Costaglioli, the assistant principal in charge of the seventh grade. "She's on a decline."
At home, her mother tells her to do her homework but rarely checks, and her stepfather, Louie Ficolara, an electrician at ABC, rarely asks about it. But together they provide a raft of high-tech toys that keep Crystal occupied but unmotivated.
The basement room she shares with Colette has all the comforts -- and distractions -- of a fully equipped apartment. "Sometimes my mom punishes me by making me go to my room," Crystal said. "But that's O.K. We've got a television, a VCR, Nintendo, a radio, books, magazines, our own phone line and a bunch of other stuff down there."
Upstairs, there are distractions, too. The television comes on just after Crystal gets home at 3. It stays on well into the night.
Mrs. Ficalora complains that the family is not brought in to the school's daily rhythms. "We don't even have to see the homework," she said. "So we don't know what they're dealing with."
Somehow, though, there has been a breakdown in communication. Last fall, Crystal's school gave each student a homework planner that encouraged parents to be involved in each day's assignment. Crystal says she lost hers and her mother concedes that although she at times helps with homework, she usually is involved only at report-card time.
 
The Streets
A Neighborhood
Of Temptations
For Crystal, though, homework can seem almost quaint in a life that whirls through a landscape full of real and perceived dangers. Outside school, her world stretches from glass-strewn lots where friends drink and smash bottles against brick walls to street corners where gang members pick fights. Her friends are an ethnic stew of Italian-Americans, Puerto Ricans, blacks and immigrants -- a multiracial bond that in coming years may well be tested.
So far, though, they face their fears together. Temptations and highs lurk everywhere. Though Crystal says she has not yet tried marijuana, LSD or crack, she talks about such drugs the way children used to talk of trolls and ice cream cones. Like most of her friends, she has already sampled alcohol and cigarettes. Other temptations await. "Everybody drinks," she said with a knowing shrug. "They drink and do acid in the park."
 
A Poke, a Slap, a Punch
 Crystal knows the varied routes to dropping out. But they do not scare her. "They hang out," she said of the students who leave school. "They do weed. They drink. They do acid. Everybody knows what they are doing."
Sex looms, too. So far, boys don't seem to be her problem. Her mother prohibits her from dating. But Crystal points out coolly, "When I'm out there you don't know where I am." Crystal's mother assumes that her 12-year-old can take care of herself. "I let her know that she has an independence," she said.
Yet just surviving is a constant struggle. Teachers, the police and parents say they are often stunned by the casualness of the violence both inside and outside school. Hallways are full of a steady stream of students who sniffle that a friend has hit or kicked them. Students are called from class for fighting. Friends poke, trip and slap.
On the streets, fights start over nothing. Many boys link up with gangs. Crystal lists their names, neighborhood by neighborhood, including two for girls, Bitches on a Mission, and the Five Million Hoodlums, to which some of her friends belong. "They can protect you," Crystal said somewhat admiringly. "They can keep you safe."
But it is toward her sister Colette that Crystal most often turns for protection. "She watches out for me," she said. "If somebody bothers me, she sends people after them."
Colette may be failing, but she has another quality that Crystal values far more than grades. She is the one older person who always listens -- and never punishes.
Still, anxiety pervades. "I'm always nervous," she said quietly one day at school, her head cast down, her hands clasps tightly between her legs. "I get nervous over nothing. And then I'll get a really big headache."
One moment of ease comes in the minutes between school and life after school. When the last bell rings, Crystal and her friends linger outside the building to remind one another that they care. Linking arms and passing gum and cigarettes around, they laugh and poke and share their secrets, their fears, their triumphs. Then they reach forward, one to the next, to kiss, almost somberly, and wish one another well.

HEADLINE: CUOMO ANNOUNCES HE IS NOT SEEKING SEAT ON HIGH COURT

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 7

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that he had asked President Clinton to remove him from consideration for an appointment to the United States Supreme Court, saying he wished to continue serving New York while the state was on the cusp of economic recovery.
Many in the Cuomo administration interpreted the Governor's announcement as a virtual declaration that he will run for a fourth four-year term next year. Mr. Cuomo said in an interview today that he was preparing aggressively for a 1994 campaign but was not ready to make a declaration. 
 The Democratic Governor, who declined to run for President in both 1988 and 1992 after long flirtations, released a letter that he wrote to Mr. Clinton today confirming a telephone conversation the two men had Thursday night. The substance of the conversation first was reported in Newsday today.
 
'Public Speculation'
 "I do not know whether you might indeed have nominated me, but because there has been public speculation concerning the possibility, I think I owe it to you to make clear now that I do not wish to be considered," Mr. Cuomo wrote.
White House officials said today that Mr. Cuomo had been under serious consideration for the seat being vacated this summer by Justice Byron R. White. And the 60-year-old Governor said no indications to the contrary had prompted his decision to withdraw.
"I had no sense that it would not be me," Mr. Cuomo said in the interview. "I will not tell you that it was offered. I will tell you I had no sense that I had been eliminated."
 
'Considerable Expectation'
 A senior White House official who requested anonymity said Mr. Cuomo "took himself out of consideration at a time when he had a considerable expectation that he would be chosen, although it wasn't a lay-down hand."
Another senior Clinton Administration official said that "nobody urged him to withdraw."
Many officials in both Washington and Albany said they were mystified by Mr. Cuomo's decision, given his affection for the law, his frequent musings about his desire to be a judge and his long tenure as Governor.
That confusion quickly gave way to speculation that Mr. Cuomo may have withdrawn his name pre-emptively after learning that he was unlikely to receive the nomination. Some also wondered whether the Governor had agreed to withdraw so that Mr. Clinton could name a woman or a minority judge as his first appointee, with the understanding that Mr. Cuomo would receive a later appointment.
Mr. Cuomo declined to rule out the possibility that he would consider a future Supreme Court opening.
"I haven't thought beyond this letter or this conversation," he said.
Mr. Cuomo used his letter today to put in a plug for Judith S. Kaye, who he nominated in February as Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals and who apparently remains a contender for the Supreme Court.
White House officials said today that other contenders include Judge Stephen G. Breyer of the United States Court of Appeals in Boston, Judge Jose A. Cabranes of the United States District Court in Connecticut, Judge Amalya L. Kearse of the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan and Judge Patricia Wald of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington.
 
'Down the Road'
 The officials said Mr. Clinton was still two to three weeks away from announcing a selection. They also said he was trying to think in terms of several appointees in case Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who is 84, or Justice John Paul Stevens, who turns 73 this month, decide to retire soon.
"We're trying to think down the road," one White House official said.
Since Justice White announced two weeks ago that he planned to retire, much of the speculation about whom Mr. Clinton would name as his first appointee to the Supreme Court has focused on Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Cuomo was the only person mentioned by the President as a prospective justice during the 1992 campaign, and he has been described as a leading contender in a number of news reports during the last week.
Aides to both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Cuomo said White House officials had held preliminary discussions about the possibility of naming the Governor to the Court with Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son and Mr. Clinton's nominee to be an assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development. On Monday, March 29, Mr. Clinton tried to contact Mr. Cuomo to discuss the Court, but the Governor missed the call. A number of other missed calls followed over the next two days.
Mr. Cuomo finally reached Mr. Clinton Thursday night, when the President was flying to Oregon for a conference on the Northwest forest.
Neither the Governor nor the President disclosed the content of the conversation today, but aides to both men said Mr. Cuomo removed himself from consideration shortly after the discussion began.
In his letter to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Cuomo wrote, "Although New York is on its way back, it has not yet fully recovered from the punishing national economic decline which you are trying so hard to reverse. I believe I can best serve by working to speed and strengthen that recovery in this state that has been so good to me and my family."
But several Cuomo aides speculated that his decision had more to do with the changes in political and personal life style that he would have to make by moving from from the Governor's office in Albany to the Supreme Court in Washington.
 
Difference in Pay
 The Supreme Court position pays $164,100 a year, more than the $130,000 Mr. Cuomo receives as Governor. But he would have to move from the richly furnished Executive Mansion, where he lives for free, to take a job with no housing allowance.
One friend of Mr. Cuomo who has talked to him about the Supreme Court said the Governor believes his current job is "better than being on the Supreme Court, to be one of nine, to be curtailed in terms of speech.
"He doesn't need the power, and he doesn't need the prestige and he doesn't need the robe."
And a Cuomo aide said the Governor "would look at the Supreme Court as a postscript to a career, and he's not ready for the postscript."
That aide said Mr. Cuomo's decision today "just about" serves as a re-election announcement.
But Mr. Cuomo would not give away his plans. "I would be surprised to hear anybody in my administration say that because that would mean they don't know a whole lot about me," he said today. "If I wanted to make a declaration that I was running in 1994, I would make it."

HEADLINE: Bosnia Reconsidered;
Where Candidate Clinton Saw a Challenge The President Sees an Insoluble Quagmire

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
After coming into office proclaiming the need to take action against moral outrages in Bosnia, the Clinton Administration has shifted gears, and is now telling the American people that Bosnia is a quagmire about which very little can be done.
In effect, the Administration has gone from shaking its fist at the Serbs to throwing up its hands. And it has gone from describing Bosnia as a test case of America's ability to nurture democracy in the post-cold-war world to being the intractable "problem from hell" that no one can be expected to solve. 
 Administration policymakers vigorously deny that they have given up trying to press the Serbs into making concessions to the Bosnian Muslims, and insist that they are now working on lifting the arms embargo to give the Muslims more of a fighting chance.
 
A Revised Perception
 But they also concede that they have begun to talk about Bosnia differently, to cast the problem there less as a moral tragedy -- which would make American inaction immoral -- and more as a tribal feud that no outsider could hope to settle.
The reason for this political redefinition goes back to the Presidential campaign, when Mr. Clinton used the Bosnia issue to differentiate himself from President Bush in foreign policy, and to put Mr. Bush on the defensive. Mr. Clinton lambasted Mr. Bush for passivity toward Bosnia's fate and for dumping the problem in the lap of the Europeans.
 
Little Support for Intervention
 But since coming into office, Clinton Administration officials have learned just how complex the Bosnia issue really is. The Europeans and Russians are woefully divided on what to do there; all polls show that the American public has no desire to send its sons and daughters to fight there, and the Pentagon resists getting involved in military action on the ground there.
At a time when the President's support for homosexuals in the armed services and his own lack of military experience have injured his credibility with some at the Pentagon, he clearly does not want to challenge the generals on Bosnia. And at a time when he is absorbed at home in the difficult effort to build support for his economic and health care programs, he cannot afford to have the nation's attention diverted and divided by debate over intervention in the Balkans.
But Mr. Clinton also does not want to look as though he is going back on another campaign pledge. Hence, the Administration is setting out to redefine for Americans the nature of the Bosnian problem in a way that makes its limited involvement there look like understandable prudence rather than moral indifference.
When the President's aides are asked what Mr. Clinton really thinks about the Bosnian situation, they say that no foreign issue troubles and frustrates him more, but he is adamant about not letting his emotions dictate policy.
The first sign of the Administration's new tone on Bosnia came on March 28, when Secretary of State Warren Christopher, appearing on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," was asked what Washington would do if the Serbs did not sign the peace agreement.
In a remark that aides said Mr. Christopher rehearsed in advance, he depicted the conflict as the re-emergence of ancient European tribal feuds. "Let me put that situation in Bosnia in just a little broader framework," he said. "It's really a tragic problem. The hatred between all three groups -- the Bosnians and the Serbs and the Croatians -- is almost unbelievable. It's almost terrifying, and it's centuries old. That really is a problem from hell. And I think that the United States is doing all we can to try to deal with that problem."
But he added, "The United States simply doesn't have the means to make people in that region of the world like each other."
Contrast that with Mr. Christopher's statement on Feb. 10, when he first unveiled the Clinton Administration's Bosnia policy by describing the conflict as the destruction of one people by another. "Serbian ethnic cleansing has been pursued through mass murders, systematic beatings, and the rapes of Muslims and others, prolonged shellings of innocents in Sarajevo and elsewhere, forced displacement of entire villages, inhumane treatment of prisoners in detention camps," he said.
Mr. Christopher added at the time that how Washington responded to the crisis in Bosnia "tests our commitment to nurturing of democracy and the support of environments in which democracy can grow and take root."
"And it tests what wisdom we have gathered from this bloody century, and it measures our resolve to take early concerted action against systematic ethnic persecution," he added.
By altering the definition of what was happening in Bosnia, Mr. Christopher was trying to change the stakes. What had been an outrage that was immoral to stand by and watch became a Balkan feud that was simply "terrifying" to watch.
President Clinton himself reinforced this view on Tuesday during his joint news conference with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He declared, in effect, that the United States was not ready to act with force on its own in Bosnia, that the Europeans were ready to do even less and that therefore it was quite possible that the Serbs would get away with their aggression.
Asked what more could be done by the United States and Europeans on Bosnia, Mr. Clinton said: "It is a difficult situation. It is the most difficult and most frustrating problem in the world today. The only point I was trying to make is I have proceeded all along on the assumption that whatever we did and whatever we could do, we would and should act through the United Nations in a multilateral way."
The President insisted that he had done his "best to continue to stiffen the sanctions, to continue to push for more action, to push for enforcement of the no-fly zone, to push all the countries involved to do what we could to try to bring this to a successful conclusion, so that the principle of ethnic cleansing is not rewarded in Bosnia and therefore encouraged in other countries."
But he added: "The United States is not capable of solving the problem alone. I don't think anyone expects us to do that. We have been in many cases more aggressive in what we were willing to do than the European neighbors of the former Yugoslavia."
If the Europeans will not follow, Mr. Clinton suggested, then it is impossible for Washington to lead. He then cited the Persian Gulf war coalition as an example of the cooperation that is required. But it was precisely the Bush Administration's willingness to draw a line in the sand, and commit its own manpower first, that brought the Europeans along behind it in the gulf war. In Bosnia, Mr. Clinton is suggesting that if the Europeans will not follow, America cannot lead.
Asked if this gridlock might not allow the Serbs to get their way, as long as they can withstand economic sanctions, Mr. Clinton answered: "That is what I am concerned about. You got it. That's about as good a statement as I could have made myself."
 
Balkan Update
 The United Nations commander in BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, Lieut. Gen. Philippe Morillon of France, led a convoy of armored vehicles yesterday to the besieged Muslim enclave of SREBRENICA, carrying needed food and medical supplies. General Morillon told aides he would remain there to insure the survival of the town and its 60,000 residents. Some 150 Canadian troops are also enroute to Srebrenica, and a convoy was planned today to evacuate wounded, sick and needy people.
In BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, the Russian envoy, Vitaly Churkin met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia on what the Yugoslav news agency Tanyug called "a new Russian initiative toward resolving the conflict" in Bosnia. He also met with the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic.
The United States and its NATO allies meeting in BRUSSELS delayed giving the final go-ahead to military plans for enforcing a United Nations-authorized ban on flights over Bosnia because of last-minute French concerns. But ambassadors of the 16 nations of NATO said the alliance's warplanes would start the operation by the middle of next week. European warplanes began arriving in ITALY in preparation for enforcing the ban.
At the UNITED NATIONS in New York, MACEDONIA was approved for membership by the Security Council after months of haggling with Greece over the symbolism of the former Yugoslav republic's name.
Moving with unusual speed, the World Court in THE HAGUE said it would rule today on the Bosnian Muslims' request for emergency protection from what they say is Serbian genocide.

HEADLINE: U.S. Oil Loan for Russia Faces Dispute and Delay

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
A White House plan to assemble $2 billion in Federal loans to the Russian oil and gas industry by next Wednesday is unrealistic, American and international financial officials said today.
For a year and a half, the deal has been mired in divisions within the Russian Government and in a squabble pitting the United States against the World Bank. Some of the difficulties have been resolved, but Russia will not receive any money until later this year, a World Bank official said today. 
 An American official said that while an agreement for the loans might be signed soon for symbolic purposes, it would be "the icing on the cake, without the cake." Both officials insisted on anonymity.
A White House summary of the assistance program, released after the meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, last weekend between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, included a "push for completion by April 14" of the loan arrangement. But the loan was not included in a $1.6 billion assistance package for Russia announced on Sunday because of uncertainty that the loan's major details could be arranged quickly.
The Export-Import Bank of the United States, a Federal agency that finances some American exports, has been trying to lend the money since September 1991.
On Dec. 18, Eugene K. Lawson, who was the bank's acting chairman until January, held a news conference and announced that an agreement to make the loans was imminent. This never happened.
 
An Elusive Commitment
 "Having announced it about 15 dozen times that we were about to have this, it keeps seeming to elude us," Mr. Lawson said.
The loans would pay for the purchase of American oil- and gas-production equipment and parts. A lack of spare parts has idled 36,000 oil wells in Russia, a fifth of the country's total, and eroded its ability to earn convertible foreign currency to pay for imports and for some of the costs of economic change.
The loans would be repaid with the proceeds from the Russian oil and gas exports. To assure repayment and to limit the chances for corruption, the proceeds would go into a special offshore account that Moscow would not be able to tap for any other purpose.
But the arrangement encountered two obstacles. First, the World Bank has barred its debtors from setting up offshore accounts because the bank insists on being the senior creditor in exchange for its not requiring any collateral for its loans. Also, some factions in the Russian Government oppose the accounts as an insult to the nation's sovereignty.
"They didn't want to be treated like Nigeria; they wanted to be treated like a great power." said Mr. Lawson, who is now the president of the United States-Russia Business Council, a Washington trade association for companies trading with Russia.
Last week, the World Bank's executive board decided to allow waivers for offshore accounts, provided that countries being granted waivers demonstrated clear need, and had an acceptable economic recovery program in place or nearly so.
But the World Bank has not yet decided what constitutes an acceptable economic program. Its own loan provisions require that a country meet stiff targets for reducing budget deficits and curbing growth in the money supply.
 
Bureaucracy Sets In
 Russia has not been meeting these goals and on top of that, suffers from extremely high inflation.
The Russians have not yet applied for a waiver, which, though a formality, would take a few weeks to review, a World Bank official said. "Nothing here happens in a few days," the official added, emphasizing that the April 14 deadline was unrealistic as a result.
Once a waiver is granted, the bank still extensively reviews each sale by producers of American drilling equipment before actually lending money. This can take several months.
In a separate matter, the Ex-Im Bank announced on Monday that it had approved an $82 million loan to Gazprom, Russia's natural gas production and distribution enterprise. The deal, which does not rely on an offshore account, calls for Gazprom to buy pipeline-construction equipment from Caterpillar Inc. The transaction was set up last year, before Moscow began defaulting on grain-purchase loans guaranteed by the Agriculture Department.

HEADLINE: White House Trying to Trim Blocked Jobs Bill, Aides Say

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Acknowledging that it has failed to win over any of the Senate Republicans who are blocking President Clinton's $19.5 billion economic stimulus plan, the White House is working on significantly scaling it back, senior Administration officials said today.
While no decision has been made on how much the plan could be cut, several proposals have been recommended to the White House, from a Republican suggestion to halve the plan and eliminate spending on community development, to a Democratic plan to delay putting it into effect. 
 Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, one of a group of conservative Democrats whose support is crucial to the President's budget, sent a compromise to the White House today that would trim the spending package by 25 percent and delay the implementation of another part of it.
The Administration aides conceded that Mr. Clinton's chances of peeling off the three Republican votes he needs to end a nine-day filibuster in the Senate grew dimmer today. They said the White House had concluded that the plan Mr. Clinton presented to the Senate would have to be significantly changed if it was to survive.
"We are having direct discussions with the Republican senators who have a particular interest in this jobs program that has a direct impact on their state," said Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff.
 
Clinton Strategy Defended
 George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said it was not necessarily inconsistent for the President to step up his attacks on the Republicans blocking the plan while backing away from the package he originally proposed.
"He's going to fight for as much of this program as he can get," Mr. Stephanopoulos said of the President's actions. "At the same time, if adjustments are needed to allow for a debate and vote on the President's package, he is willing to consider those adjustments."
The White House has targeted three Republican Senators -- Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, James M. Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- for special wooing after the Senate's two-week recess, which began Monday. But there was no sign that any were willing to give ground.
"I will listen to anything," Senator D'Amato said today. But he added, "I certainly can't go along with the package, nor will I, as it is."
 
'Genuine Stimulus' Needed
 Senator Jeffords, a moderate, saidthe White House would have to demonstrate its interest in "genuine stimulus and job creation" before he considers breaking ranks.
But he also said his standards for what can be defined as genuine remains high. He said he would support spending for unemployment compensation, highway construction, summer jobs and child immunization, but not at the level Mr. Clinton recommended.
The $19.5 billion job stimulus bill is made up of about $4 billion for the extension of unemployment benefits, $2 billion for education grants, $6 billion in spending for highways and public improvements and $2 billion for summer jobs. The Republicans have been especially critical of $2.5 billion in proposed community development block grant spending, which they say would pay for some pork barrel projects.
An additional $3.2 billion of the package is money that has been authorized -- but never spent -- for improving roads and airports.
"We may not get 100 percent of everything we're trying to do in every area," Mr. Clinton said today, "but I do think the American people will see that the focus of all of this is to guarantee a healthy economy and a growing jobs market to try to turn this around."
Even as work began on cutting back the program, the President stepped up his attacks on the Republicans who are blocking it. He used a routine bill-signing ceremony to liken the economic recovery to "a fire starving for oxygen," and emphasized those parts of the package that would provide summer jobs and promote highway construction.
 
'We Know What Works'
 "In my view, the message of the last election was to break the gridlock and grow the economy because Americans are tired of a system that doesn't work and a recovery that doesn't produce new jobs," Mr. Clinton said at the ceremony. "We know what works. We'll only be able to reduce the deficit and increase investment in the long term if we guarantee the strength of the recovery by building jobs in the short run."
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that he had been distracted by international concerns in recent weeks and had to refocus his attention on the task of justifying the new spending he proposes as a strategy to create new jobs. He has clearly decided to take primary responsibility for selling the rest of his economic program.
Members of the President's own party have been critical, however, signaling that he cannot afford to sell his program on oratory alone. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said in an interview that the Administration badly misjudged both the mood of the Senate and the mood of the country when it tried to push the job-stimulus package intact. "They sent up a bill filled with dogs," he said.
But Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who has been managing the bill on the Senate floor, chastised his colleagues for pre-empting Mr. Clinton's negotiating opportunities.
"I don't think we ought to be rushing out with options of our own and taking away from the President his flexibility, his running room, his options," Senator Byrd said in an interview. "I think he ought to be allowed to decide what about his package ought to be negotiated, what should be negotiated."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Private Mortgage Insurers Are Facing New Competitor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Private mortgage insurers are facing competition from a new company, the Amerin Guaranty Corporation, which has pared costs sharply on policies that protect mortgage lenders if homeowners default, and charges premiums that are tax deductible to homeowners.
Amerin officials contend that their product is priced about 20 percent below similar policies offered by the four companies that now dominate the private mortgage-insurance market. Norwest Mortgage, one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders, signaled its approval yesterday and began offering Amerin insurance along with other kinds of policies through its 467 offices around the country.
 
 
Low-Income Borrowers
 Mortgage insurance is required by government agencies and most investors when a mortgage is 80 percent or more of a home's purchase price. Such policies were written for more than a million of the 7.4 million mortgages issued last year. The insurance and its cost are particularly important to banks that are trying to increase their lending to low-income families, which tend to make small down payments. 
 By offering lower-cost insurance, Gerald L. Friedman, founder and chairman of Amerin, which is based in Chicago, said it was "inevitable that part of the savings will eventually be passed on" to home buyers. Rather than holding all of the larger profit margin, he expects lenders to share some of it with home buyers in order to attract more business.
Because lenders can fatten their profit margins with Amerin mortgage insurance, Mr. Friedman expects to garner 10 percent to 15 percent of the market within thee years.
To create the savings that might be passed on, Mr. Friedman and Stuart Brafman, Amerin's president, have created a company with fewer than 35 employees; the number is not expected to rise much above 60, even if Amerin grows rapidly in coming years.
Rather than build a network of 20 or 30 branch offices and a thousand or more sales representatives, Amerin makes its sales pitch at the headquarters of mortgage lenders, not their branch offices. It also economizes by leaving the underwriting, or credit-checking part of the mortgage lending process, to the lenders.
For lenders whose record and procedures meet Amerin's standards, it agrees to insure the loans they issue without conducting its own review. To encourage lenders to keep their standards high, Amerin will lower premiums for those lenders whose loans result in fewer than normal claims and increase premiums for those whose claims are high.
"The mortgage origination system is the largest capital market in America," Mr. Friedman said, "and the last part of that delivery system to change has been private mortgage insurance."
 
 
Tax Considerations
 For home buyers, the Amerin insurance is attractive because the annual insurance premiums -- roughly four-tenths of 1 percent of the mortgage amount -- are part of the monthly mortgage payment, the interest of which is deductible from a taxpayer's income. The premiums are part of the mortgage because the insurance policy is bought by the lender, who adds the cost to the interest rate on the mortgage. Amerin says its tax advisers have assured it that mortgage interest payments that include the insurance are deductible.
With other companies, premiums are paid by the homeowner to an escrow account and are not deductible.
Amerin's business plan was promising enough to attract several blue-chip investors, who have agreed to invest an initial $200 million. Morgan Stanley & Company, which started as an adviser to Mr. Friedman, decided to sign on as an investor, and was joined by J. P. Morgan, Aetna Insurance and the pension funds of A.T.& T. and General Motors.

HEADLINE: Shuttles Profit Despite Fewer Fares

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Like the aerial acrobatics of hummingbirds, which seem to defy the laws of aerodynamics, the shuttle operations of Delta Air Lines and USAir seem to fly in the face of airline economics. Despite falling ridership, the hourly flights between New York and Boston and New York and Washington continue to make money for the otherwise money-losing carriers, leading some industry analysts to nickname them Anomalous Air.
Their profitability stems in large part from the seeming immunity of the shuttles to the fare wars that have ruined margins in most other parts of the airlines' domestic service. The ability of the shuttles to continue raising prices -- one-way fares from New York to Washington are now $138 -- was probably a consideration in Delta's promise last week to upgrade planes on these flights even while curtailing service elsewhere in the country as part of a sweeping cutback.
 
A 32-Year Run May Be Ending
 But some analysts suggest the shuttles' days of coining money may be coming to an end, 32 years after Eastern Airlines started the service in the busy Northeast Corridor. Even airline executives foresee an end to what has been the shuttle's defining characteristics -- namely, hourly service throughout the day and a seat for everyone who shows up at the gate. 
 The various gloomy assessments assume the continued fragmentation of air traffic within the corridor. Other airlines have offered flights in the corridor to take advantage of its heavy flow of business travelers, who are less sensitive to fare increases than leisure travelers. That eroded shuttle traffic to fewer than 3 million last year, from almost 4.4 million passengers in 1987.
Amtrak is also expected to continue to siphon passengers from the shuttle, as it has between New York and Washington. The fare on the 17 daily Metroliners on that route, advertised as the Civilized Shuttle, is $90 one way. Amtrak fares have been 30 to 40 percent lower than air fares "since time immemorial," according to a spokesman for the railroad.
"And if they ever get the high-speed train from Boston to New York, one day the shuttle as people know it may go bye-bye," said Gordon Linkon, president and chief executive of USAir Shuttle. "It won't pay to fly those routes every hour or half-hour."
Amtrak, it turns out, is experimenting with just such a train, the X2000, and is also in the process of extending electrified rails from New Haven to Boston.
"We anticipate completion in 1997," said Clifford Black, an Amtrak spokesman, "and then the run between New York and Boston will fall from four hours to less than three, and our current fastest New York-to-Washington train will fall from 2 hours 35 minutes to 2:15. We've been slowly taking customers from planes for 15 years, but then we'll take even more of them."
 
Amtrak Share Gaining
 Last year Amtrak carried 42.8 percent of the 3.5 million total air and rail passengers between New York and Washington -- up from 37.2 percent in 1990, according to the Department of Transportation. While Amtrak's share between New York and Boston was only 20.9 percent, even that was up from 17.3 percent in 1990.
The shuttle has also suffered at the hands of other carriers. For example, while Delta and USAir fly a total of 31 daily shuttle flights between Washington National Airport and La Guardia Airport, Trans World Airlines and American Eagle, the subsidiary of American Airlines, fly a total of 21 daily nonstops between Washington National and Kennedy International Airport. In addition, Continental flies 12 daily nonstops between Washington and Newark International Airport.
Similarly, Delta and USAir fly 33 daily nonstops between Boston and La Guardia, while T.W.A. and American Eagle fly 22 between Boston and Kennedy. Continental flies 17 daily nonstops between Boston and Newark.
While fares for those flights are about the same as for the shuttle, for an unrestricted coach seat, an array of promotional fares can lower a one-way ticket to below $80.
 
Stimulating Air Traffic
 With so many promotional fares and airports to choose from, the nonshuttle flights probably help stimulate air traffic in the corridor, analysts say, or at least keep it from eroding further. But some of that traffic appears to be derived from would-be shuttle passengers who find Kennedy or Newark more convenient, or who prefer nonshuttle flights for other reasons.
For example, at Delta's shuttle gate at La Guardia one recent evening, two Washington-bound passengers, Stephanie Brzozowski and Allyson Deane, who sell advertising for PC magazine, said some co-workers flew American Eagle to Washington partly because they preferred American Airlines for its frequent flier program.
Nevertheless, "The shuttle has been very successful since we began operating it in 1991," said Neil Monroe, a spokesman for Delta, which bought it from Pan Am during that carrier's death throes.
The shuttle had been consistently profitable for Pan Am, even when that carrier's other routes were losing millions. "We started it in October 1986 and from Day 1 we had 24 percent of the market," said Jeff Kriendler, a former Pan Am official. "We become profitable within the first year of operation."
Pan Am's market share eventually averaged between between 56 and 60 percent, while Delta's share currently is about 52 percent.
 
The Old Days
 Eastern enjoyed a 100 percent market share for 20 years, until New York Air started a competing shuttle in 1981. It operated until 1986, when New York Air's corporate parent, the Texas Air Corporation, bought Eastern. After the Justice Department announced that it would begin investigating the merger's effect on competition, Pan Am bought New York Air's slots and gates for $65 million.
When Eastern subsequently fell on hard financial times, Donald J. Trump bought its shuttle for $350 million in 1989. But ownership of the renamed Trump Shuttle had to be transferred to a group of banks when the Trump Organization stopped paying interest on the debt. USAir paid $16.2 million to manage and operate the shuttle for four and a half years, with an option to buy.
Mr. Linkon of USAir acknowledges that "it's tough, very tough to make money in this market," because "what was once a single-carrier money tree has been divided between two carriers." But speaking of the owners of the USAir Shuttle, he said, "They're getting more than their money's worth."
The shuttle operation remains profitable, analysts say, because despite occasional price wars, Delta and USAir are careful not to try filling seats by offering money-losing fares, as most of the industry did last summer. While both carriers offer discounted advance purchase fares, as well as cheaper weekend and child fares, the usual one-way walk-up fare ranges from $138 to $150.
 
Price Not a Factor
 The current shuttle operators believe, as did the shuttle operators before them, that most business travelers -- who make up 80 percent of their passengers -- are relatively unconcerned about prices. "I wish I could tell you that at $99 fares our traffic was a little better," Mr. Linkon said, "but when it went up to $119 two weeks later there was no difference. And it was about the same when it went to $150." If the fare went up to $200 it might be a different story, he said, "But I'm not planning to find out."
Where lower fares do make a big difference, Mr. Linkon said, is with leisure travelers. Fares are as low as $39 for children accompanied by an adult. "By lowering those fares," Mr. Linkon said, "we have in essence doubled the number of minor children on our flights."
The competition between Delta and USAir has been through enhancements and services, although each usually quickly matches the other. At various times, they have both offered as many as 6,000 frequent flier miles for a 400-mile round trip. For a nominal price Delta offers helicopter service from Manhattan while USAir offers limousine service. USAir offers assigned seats, and last year it removed up to nine seats in each of its planes to give passengers the same leg room as Delta's. Delta recently said it would replace its shuttle fleet with newer renovated planes.
One notable amenity, allowing passengers to pay on board the hourlong flights, fell victim to the time constraints on flight attendants, who have time only to serve snacks or modest meals.
An improving economy is likely to put more business travelers on shuttle flights, at least initially, but some analysts are pessimistic about the long-range outlook. George Pearson, president of Avitas, an airline consulting firm in Reston, Va., acknowledged that the shuttles were probably making money with their current fares and load factors (that is, percentage of seats filled) in the low 50 percent range.
"But what happens," he asked, "if load factors continue to deteriorate or the carriers have to lower fares to remain competitive?"

HEADLINE: A Volley of Airline News Raises Industry Stocks

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Bulls woke to the sound of planes booming overhead yesterday, and apparently liked what they heard.
Companies in the long-sputtering airline industry issued a number of announcements that spurred a broad rally in stocks. The Standard & Poor's airline index reached a 52-week high, while the Dow Jones transportation average surged to a record. [Page D8.] 
 Most noteworthy was an unexpectedly large jump in domestic passenger traffic in March, which is seen by many as suggesting a healthy economic rebound and possible profits for the beleaguered industry this summer. Some airline executives said that bookings for the coming months were very strong.
So after roughly five years of virtually no growth in the industry, "we now have a classic cyclical recovery in traffic," said Julius Maldutis, airline analyst at Salomon Brothers. He estimated March domestic traffic up 4.2 percent, and 6 percent when adjusted for the effects of the Northeastern blizzard that canceled thousands of flights.
The airlines still face fundamental problems to be addressed by a commission that was formally authorized yesterday by President Clinton. The panel is to develop a plan for revitalizing the industry. Mr. Clinton said that answers might "lie in a more aggressive trade policy, others may come from keeping the global marketplace freer from unfair competition, more may stem from the supporting role of aviation in preserving our national security."
 
A Convergence of Hopes
 Like the President's signature, many of yesterday's events were not unexpected. But the din of positive announcements seems to have impressed airline watchers. Most of the fragmented news items pointed to greater efficiency. "We're seeing the beginning of a lot of restructuring that will force inefficient capacity out," said Kevin Murphy, airline analyst at Morgan Stanley.
For example, United Airlines said it had converted firm orders into options for 49 Boeing planes as part of plan to slash capital spending by $5.5 billion through 1996. The move by United, the nation's second-largest carrier, pushed up the price of its stock by $9.875, to $137.
Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of the parent UAL Corporation, said that "as painful as these decisions are, Boeing and United recognize that the immense economic problems the industry is facing have forced us to scale back our capital spending plans significantly."
Southwest Airlines said it would begin service from San Jose, Calif., to Burbank, north of Los Angeles, and to Las Vegas. The move solidified the low-cost carrier's strength in California, pushing up its stock price $2.75 to close at $38.875.
As Southwest moved into San Jose, American Airlines announced that it was dropping nearly half its flights from its money-losing hub operation there. Investors cheered the action and bid up the stock of the parent AMR Corporation by $3.25 to $69.
Delta Air Lines started the latest round of cost-cutting last week, when it abandoned a 36-year-old policy of no layoffs and said it would eliminate 600 pilots' jobs by the fall. Investors cheered the cuts then and seemed swept up in optimism again yesterday, raising Delta stock $3.50, to $57.
America West, operating under bankruptcy protection since June 1991, said Tuesday that it would probably be unable to make a payment on a $100 million loan that had been made in the first place to keep it operating. But this bad news from America West gave analysts further confidence that excess seat capacity might be removed from the system.
USAir Group was also swept up in the bullish airline market, rising $3.125, to a 52-week high of $24.75.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Continental Optimistic
WILMINGTON, Del., April 8 (Reuters) -- Continental Airlines, which is operating under Chapter 11, said today that it foresaw profits this year and through 1996.
John Luth, the company's chief financial officer, told a United States Bankruptcy Court hearing that there would be an operating loss of $181 million and a net profit of $567 million in the period from January to April. He forecast an operating profit of $168.3 million and a net profit of $26.9 million for May through December.
Continental filed for bankruptcy in December 1990. Mr. Luth testified on the final day of hearings on the company's reorganization plan. A decision by Bankruptcy Judge Helen Balick is expected on the plan within a few days. Under it, Air Canada and Air Partners of Dallas would invest $450 million in Continental.

HEADLINE: France Wants 'Trade Peace'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PARIS, April 7

 BODY:
France's new conservative Government, which took a hard line on trade during last month's general election campaign, is sending out peace signals now that it has taken power.
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said today that the Government was adopting a more constructive approach to the issue than the previous Socialist Government. "On GATT, we have moved from a diplomacy of blockage to a diplomacy of movement," Mr. Juppe told Europe 1 radio. 
 Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, appointed a week ago, told French farm leaders on Tuesday that his Government opposed a draft farm accord reached in Washington last November. But, according to aides, Mr. Balladur does not want to cause a crisis by threatening to veto the pact, and he wants "trade peace" with Washington.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, welcomed the French shift while cautioning that the United States had not heard directly from the French Government. "We are hopeful that they, like we, see trade and trade expansion as key to restoring economic growth," he said in a statement in Washington.
The center-right used farm trade as a political sledgehammer, saying the Socialists had failed to stand up for French farmers in talks with Washington. Now it is asking for time to shape policy.

HEADLINE: Tobacco Price Reductions Could Help the Bond Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Philip Morris's 40-cent-a-pack cut in the price of its Marlboro cigarettes was bad news for the stock market, other cigarette companies and the idea of brand-name attraction. But the news could turn out to be a help for the bond market.
Tobacco price increases over the last year have been a major factor in the increases in both the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index. In the 12 months through February, tobacco prices were the fastest-rising component of the consumer index, rising 10.4 percent. For the producer index for the 12 months, the rise in tobacco prices has accounted for about three-tenths of a percentage point of the 1.8 percent increase. 
 The cut in Marlboro prices, if it spreads, could take some pressure off inflation at a time when price jitters seem to have capped the bond market rally that began just after the Presidential election. That rally sent the yield on the 30-year bond down to a 16-year low of 6.72 percent on March 8. It was the expectation of many investors that inflation would decline this year that gave the rally much of its momentum.
Joel Popkin, the head of his own research firm in Washington, said that he expected a broad cut in tobacco prices could trim one- to two-tenths of a percentage point off the Producer Price Index. The impact on the Consumer Price Index will be less because this price index covers goods and services while the producer index covers just the cost of goods.
Mr. Popkin also thinks the reductions may come as other prices are slowing in the middle of the year, aiding in inflation's moderation.
 
 
'Better Prices'
 "It will come at a time when there will be better prices in general so inflation will look even better and some bond market participants may choose to interpret it as a sign that prices are starting to recede," he said.
The lower prices could begin to show up in the April inflation data, which is released in May, and through the summer. If tobacco helps, along with other factors, including possible restrictions on health-care prices as part of President Clinton's health-care plan, then the signs of slowing inflation could be very reassuring to the bond market.
None of the easing of inflationary pressures is expected to have a major impact in the reports on the March Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index, however, which will be released this morning and tomorrow, respectively. The bond market is officially closed for the Good Friday holiday.
It was the unexpectedly strong economic data for the first two months of the year -- and the fear that the trend will continue in the March reports -- that helped spook bond traders and investors in the last month. For the first two months of this year, the consumer index rose at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, while the producer index was up 3.4 percent.
Another reason slowing inflation could help the market is that many investors apparently had been buying bonds on the belief -- supported by some prominent forecasters -- that the rate of inflation would decline this year to below the 2.9 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index in 1992.
 
 
A Lot of Doubts
 While the increases in the two inflation indexes this year have raised a lot of doubts, there are still forecasters who expect that a slowly growing economy and price breaks on tobacco and other goods will help to moderate inflation enough during the rest of the year to bring it below 3 percent.
But this forecast is losing adherents. "A couple of months ago, the world was moving in my direction and thinking that inflation was moving lower," said Edward Yaredeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "But now they are thinking it will be the same or maybe even higher."
Mr. Popkin thinks it is not possible for the consumer index to be lower this year, in part because of the surge at the beginning of the year. With the consumer index rising at a 4.6 percent annual rate for the first three months of the year -- including an expected increase of three-tenths of 1 percent for March -- the rest of the year will have to average less than a two-tenths of 1 percent increase a month, or an annual rate of 2.2 percent for the next nine months, to get below last year's rate.
Mr. Popkin forecasts a rise of around 3.5 percent in the Consumer Price Index. He expects that the rates of increase will slow in the middle of the year, compared to the spurt in the first three months of the year. But then he thinks that the pace will pick up a little at the end of the year.
Raymond McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., is forecasting that the pace of inflation will be slower in the rest of the year because of lower tobacco prices and because the huge jump in clothing prices in the beginning of the year will subside.
But he still expects the monthly Producer Price Index increases to be two- to three-tenths of 1 percent, which is higher than last year, and a rate for the year of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. For the Consumer Price Index, he expects monthly increases of three-tenths of 1 percent, with an annual rate of around 3.5 percent.
 
 
Treasury Market
 Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were little changed yesterday ahead of the release of the Producer Price Index today and the Consumer Price Index tomorrow, when the bond market is officially closed for the Good Friday holiday.
Bond prices got a lift early in the day after the second report in two days -- yesterday's from Goldman, Sachs & Company -- said the Treasury would cut the size of the 30-year bond auction and switch to two auctions a year instead of four.
But most of the gains were lost in later thin trading. The price of the 30-year bond was up 5/32 with the yield down to 6.95 percent, from 6.96 percent Tuesday. Treasury note prices were up less or unchanged.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills. The auction was delayed from Monday because Congress had not approved an increase in the Government's borrowing limit.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PRESSING UKRAINE ON A-ARMS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
In an effort to put pressure on Ukraine to give up the nuclear weapons left on its soil by the Soviet Union, the Clinton Administration has rebuffed Ukraine's request for a meeting between the Prime Minister and President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore, senior Administration officials say.
The officials say the rebuff is part of an effort to get the Ukrainians to fulfill their promises to ratify the arms-reduction treaty and give up the nuclear weapons. 
But some specialists fear the move may send a signal that the Kiev Government is important to Washington only to the extent that it is a nuclear power.
Ukraine's position is crucial because Moscow and Washington have said they will not begin to carry out the arms-reduction treaty until Kiev ratifies the accord and joins the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is intended to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.
 
The Request From Kiev
 Ukrainian legislators said recently that Kiev may ratify the arms-reduction treaty but refrain from joining the non-proliferation treaty, thus keeping its option to develop a nuclear arsenal.
The new attempt to put pressure on Ukraine began when Representative E. (Kika) de la Garza, a Texas Democrat and chairman of the Agriculture Committee, invited Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma to meet with his committee. The former director of an SS-18 missile factory, Mr. Kuchma has become an advocate of change, particularly on economic matters.
In March, after the committee's invitation was received, Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko came to Washington and met with Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Mr. Zlenko informed the Administration that Mr. Kuchma wanted to meet with Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore.
The request was taken up by a committee led by Strobe Talbott, the ambassador at large for the nations spawned from the former Soviet Union. Mr. Christopher was also consulted.
 
The Response by Washington
 The Administration decided to inform Kiev that such a meeting could not be guaranteed in advance, effectively rebuffing the Ukrainian request.
Prime Minister Kuchma was also told that a visit to Washington would be more "opportune" if Ukraine first ratified the arms-reduction treaty and acceded to the non-proliferation treaty, one senior Administration official said. But Mr. Kuchma was also told that if he was determined to press ahead with his visit, meetings could be arranged with lower-ranking officials.
The rebuff reflected a calculation that the Administration should not "reward" Ukrainians with high-level meetings until they ratified the two treaties. Top Administration officials believe Kiev is trying to squeeze new concessions from Washington.
 
The Skeptics
 Some experts, however, said the rebuff was a mistake and would strengthen the hand of those Ukrainians who argue that Kiev should hold on to the nuclear weapons.
Paul A. Goble, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department expert on non-Russian ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, said the Administration's policy "will have the opposite effect of what is intended."
"If they want to send a signal to the Ukrainians that they are isolated and nobody loves then," he said, "and therefore they might want to think about how to defend themselves, this is a good way to do it."

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Race Sees Democrats Vote for Basics

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENOSHA, Wis., April 7

 BODY:
Congressional primary voters looking for a successor to Secretary of Defense Les Aspin gave an easy victory on Tuesday to a conventional Democrat, who had pushed jobs and health care, over a rival who had run against Congress as hard as he had run for it.
The Democratic winner, Peter Barca, a state legislator for eight years, will now face the Republican victor, Mark Neumann, a wealthy homebuilder who said today that the general election, on May 4, would focus on President Clinton's economic plans. 
 "Bill Clinton the man is very popular here, but the increase in taxes on working people isn't," said Mr. Neumann, who ran against Mr. Aspin last fall and threw a scare into him before the Democrat rallied to win his 12th term in the House, with 58 percent of the vote.
Mr. Barca, 37, said today that although he hoped deeper cuts in Federal spending could be found, "the spirit of Clinton's economic program is right." And he said his Republican opponent failed to understand the urgency of the health-care problem and what he described as the need for "radical surgery" to provide full access to care.
 
Stressing the Traditional
 Mr. Barca defeated Jeff Neubauer, also 37, by stressing traditional Democratic themes -- jobs, health care and improved education and job training -- along with his call for "meaningful action on the deficit," including a law that would give the President authority to veto individual items in spending bills.
He also emphasized his experience in the Legislature, where he is chairman of the Democratic caucus, and relied on strong labor support to gain a big edge here in Kenosha, his hometown, and cut into Mr. Neubauer's vote in his own hometown, Racine. Those two old industrial cities along Lake Michigan cast more than two-thirds of the Democratic votes in this southeastern Wisconsin district.
With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Barca had 32,744 votes, or 50 percent, to 21,306, or 33 percent, for Mr. Neubauer, with the rest scattered. In the Republican contest, Mr. Neumann had 27,569 votes, or 79 percent, to 7,378, or 21 percent, for Charles Coleman, a state legislator.
Mr. Neubauer, a former legislator and Democratic state chairman, had sought to tie himself to Mr. Clinton, whom he backed early in the 1992 Presidential race. But his main emphasis was to challenge Congress itself. In television advertisements, he called boldly for a "pay cut for Congress," although when questioned about it he urged only a modest trim: a cancellation of the lawmakers' last cost-of-living raise.
Campaigning at bowling alleys and at free-meal lines in church halls until the polls closed Tuesday night, Mr. Neubauer said he hoped to work with newer members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, to develop a "governing coalition of people who want reform."
He also called for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, promised not to "send costly political junk mail at taxpayer expense" and demanded that Congress abandon its "lavish perks and privileges." But against Mr. Barca's basic Democratic message, the Neubauer appeal failed.
The general election, one of this spring's four House special elections caused by resignations, appears to favor the Democrats slightly. Mr. Barca and Mr. Neubauer helped by avoiding attacks on each other during the primary campaign. And while last fall Mr. Neumann could make incumbency and the flaws of Congress the issues against Mr. Aspin, Mr. Barca carries no such baggage.
So Mr. Neumann, 38, will be stressing the taxes in the Clinton program. He will call for spending cuts and argue, as he did today, that "I've balanced budgets in the real world." He can expect considerable outside help from his party.
But making the distinction Mr. Neumann promised today, of attacking Mr. Clinton's programs but not Mr. Clinton personally, may prove difficult. Mr. Clinton carried this district last November with 41 percent of the vote, to 35 percent for President George Bush and 23 percent for Ross Perot.

HEADLINE: Stock Option Rule Change Is Planned

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
The Financial Accounting Standards Board put corporations and their top executives on notice yesterday that starting in 1997 it plans to require companies to take a charge against earnings when they grant stock options.
But it left the door wide open for companies to continue issuing gargantuan option awards without harming earnings for three more years. Through 1996, companies would only be expected to estimate in their footnotes what profits would look like if the charge was immediately taken. 
 "That is a downside of it," said Ralph V. Whitworth, president of the United Shareholders Association in Washington, noting that many companies were already accelerating their option grants in anticipation of the rule change. "I'm sure there will be those that try to get in under the wire, and it's a pretty clear wire."
 
Time to Press Case
 For the F.A.S.B., whose pronouncements never attracted the likes of CNN television camera crews until yesterday, the long lead time also means that the controversy surrounding stock options, which typically give employees the right to buy their companies' stock at a fixed price any time over 10 years, will not ebb for some time.
Many top executives who are following the debate say flat out that they have no intention of spending the next three years experimenting with various option pricing models (one reason the F.A.S.B. cited for not making the effective date more immediate as some had wanted).
On the contrary, top executives say they intend to use the time to lobby, cajole and otherwise try to persuade the accounting board to back off.
"It is somewhat gratifying that the F.A.S.B. has at least delayed the implementation of a charge to earnings for a lengthy period," said Brian Borders, president of the Association of Publicly Traded Companies in Washington. He said his group of 400 small and midsize companies would "continue to work with the F.A.S.B., the Securities and Exchange Commission and, if necessary, the Congress to avoid the ultimate implementation of that charge to earnings."
The business community will have plenty of opportunities to make its influence felt; four seats -- and perhaps all seven -- on the accounting board will turn over by the end of 1997, and all appointments are made by the Financial Accounting Foundation, a not-for-profit group on which big business is well represented.
At least one small investor yesterday complained that the length of the delay put the final outcome in too much doubt. "It's going to be three years until the rule takes effect, and business is going to lobby like crazy to derail it," said Leonard Susseles, a 66-year-old Brooklyn resident who once owned a leather goods factory and now lives from his investments.
Timothy S. Lucas, the F.A.S.B.'s research director, indicated that the board would be happy to reconsider the issue, but was not likely to budge on the larger principle. "Several board members said there is value in these plans and when you give an employee something of value in return for working there that is compensation and should be charged to expense," he said.
 
Changes in Compensation Plans
 The board plans to give companies some leeway in how they comply. It is not, for instance, insisting that companies use any particular model for pricing options, as long as their choice satisfies certain criteria. And once companies compute the value, they can spread the cost over as many years as it takes for the awards to become vested.
Companies are likely to consider revamping their compensation programs as a result.
Stock options have become the most popular form of executive compensation because of their favorable tax and accounting treatment. They are the only major form of compensation that does not reduce earnings. Yet companies get a tax deduction when executives exercise the options.
One critic of the current accounting rules was happy yesterday that the double standard was about to end. "The F.A.S.B.'s proposal, if it becomes final, would place a reasonable check on executive pay packages which contain options, a check which until now has been missing," Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said in a statement.
But George H. Sollman, chief executive of the Centigram Communications Corporation of San Jose, Calif., vowed to continue fighting the charge. He is one of many chief executives who can recite from memory the exact number of Senator Levin's bill (S259), which some say prodded the F.A.S.B. into action.
Mr. Sollman is a spokesman for the 20 high-technology companies that have banded under the banner of the Coalition for American Equity Expansion. They feel the charge will throttle the nation's high-tech sector.
Centigram, for instance, would be facing a 40 percent reduction in earnings because it makes stock options available to all of its employees. "And we are not abnormal," Mr. Sollman said. "In Silicon Valley, it's one of the currencies you use to attract, keep and motivate employees, and it's made a difference in terms of our competitiveness."
 
Performance Options
 One wrinkle sure to please people on all sides of the issue is a proposed change in how companies account for options that have some strings attached. Advocates for shareholders would like companies to make their option grants contingent on performance, either by requiring management to outperform the market, or at least inflation.
Under current accounting rules, performance options are highly disadvantaged because they alone must be booked. So few companies issue them.
Now that performance options and plain-vanilla options would enjoy the same accounting treatment, companies will probably take a second look at issuing performance options.

Tax-Exempt Yields Drop While Taxables Advance

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The average yields on tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were mixed in the latest week because of shifting investor interests, according to the most recent survey by IBC's Money Fund Report.
In the tax-exempt category, yields were down moderately in the week ended Tuesday. Analysts noted that the volume of municipal issues, though down somewhat, remained heavy. Strong investor demand pushed prices higher and yields lower in the latest week. 
 The assets of the tax-exempt money funds increased $1.7 billion in the latest period, pushing total assets to $103.9 billion. Walter S. Frank, chief economist at the Money Fund Report, said, "You're not seeing the rush by tax-exempt issuers to refinance older debt as you did in the earlier part of the year, and we're now seeing a noticeable amount of money coming out of the once-attractive long end of the market to the short end."
Money managers appeared to sit tight this week, with the average number of days left until maturity of securities in portfolios unchanged at 50.
The IBC/Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund fell 4 basis points, to 1.98 percent, with the average seven-day simple yield also down 4 basis points, to 1.96 percent. Over a 30-day period, the compounded yield is averaging 1.92 percent, and the simple yield 1.90 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Less state and local taxes, the taxable bond equivalent for the average seven-day yield is 2.75 percent for investors in a 28 percent tax bracket, and 2.78 percent for those in a 31 percent bracket.
Among the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million, the Money Fund Report said the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market again outperformed all other funds in its group with a yield of 2.64 percent, or 11 basis points lower than its top yield last week.
 
Taxable Funds
 Aided by a selloff in the stock and bond markets, assets of taxable money market funds increased by $15.8 billion, to a total $485.9 billion, in the week ended yesterday. Institutional fund assets rose $13.2 billion, to $169.6 billion, while retail assets gained $2.6 billion, to $316.3 billion. Some new funds contributed $2.4 billion.
"As expected, the bulk of the money flowing into the funds was from large institutional investors," Mr. Frank said. "The money funds are the natural place for institutionals when there is turmoil in the markets."
Analysts said the average number of days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios remained at 60.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compounded yield on a taxable fund rose a basis point, to 2.71 percent, with the seven-day simple yield also up a basis point, to 2.67 percent.
The Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund had the highest return among general-purpose taxable money funds, with a yield of 3.50 percent.
For comparative purposes, banks, which compete directly for investors' cash, are offering an average 2.60 percent. The yield is down a basis point from a week ago.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Up Against Mark, Falls Again in Yen Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Traders broadened their selloff of German marks yesterday, propelling the dollar mostly higher on world markets. But the Japanese yen benefited even more from the mark-selling and touched another record high against the dollar.
The mark's decline was mostly traced to further speculation that Germany was preparing to cut interest rates after more gloomy economic news this week. 
 Gold edged higher in New York after falling overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 50 cents a troy ounce to close at $338.40. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $337.75, up 25 cents from late Tuesday.
The rush to sell marks began Tuesday on a report of higher unemployment in West Germany and news that Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial group, planned 14,700 job cuts.
 
Lower Rates Expected
 Afraid of aggravating inflation, Germany's central bank has been hesistant to lower interest rates too fast. But more and more traders believe the Bundesbank may begin to favor swifter easings as a way to stimulate the economy.
Reinforcing that view on Wednesday, the Dutch and Belgium Governments cut their key short-term interest rates, seeming to help pave the way for lower rates in other European countries.
Many traders sold their marks for Japanese yen, one of the few major currencies viewed as fundamentally strong.
The dollar closed in Tokyo at 114.02 yen, down 0.26 yen from Tuesday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 113.65 yen. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar was quoted at 113.50 yen, down from late Tuesday's 113.85 yen and a new postwar low.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5150 from $1.5140 late Tuesday. At late afternoon in New York, a pound traded at $1.5135, less than late Tuesday's $1.5150.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday: 1.6190 German marks, up from 1.6110; 1.4910 Swiss francs, up from 1.4875; 5.4770 French francs, up from 5.4580; 1,591.00 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.2631 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2585.

HEADLINE: Installment Debt Rises $1.2 Billion

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Consumers increased their installment debt by $1.2 billion in February, to $728.8 billion, the sixth straight monthly advance following an extended decline, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Credit card and other revolving debt jumped by $2.4 billion, or 11.4 percent at an annual rate, while loans to buy automobiles rose $1 billion, a 4.8 percent pace. 
 However, much of this rise was offset by a $2.2 billion drop in "other" credit, which includes loans to finance mobile homes, education, boats and vacations.
"The consumer is still operating in a fairly conservative fashion," commented Edward F. McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs. He called "overstated" the assertions that consumers have significantly liberalized spending after a period of repaying debt. The debt decline was concentrated in automobile credit, Mr. McKelvey noted, a category affected by the expansion of leasing.
The decline in other credit over the last two months, analysts suggested, may reflect debt consolidation on the part of those who have taken advantage of falling interest rates to refinance homes. The higher revolving debt could reflect bills from the Christmas holidays.
January's rise in overall installment credit was revised to $1 billion from an initial estimate of $900 million, today's report also showed.
Over the latest 12 months, overall installment debt is up a very modest $400 million, with a rise in revolving accounts almost entirely offset by a decline in other debt, the same pattern as prevailed in February.
The Fed's consumer credit report includes all household debt not secured by real estate. It does not include home equity loans or mortgages.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Selling pollution rights isn't popular; neither are alternatives.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
SHOULD polluters be allowed to buy their way out of cleaning up? The idea of selling pollution indulgences does not go down easily among those steeped in the Puritan ethic. Once understood, though, the concept of converting environmental sin into a commodity that can be traded like heating oil futures or I.B.M. stock looks like the cheapest way to solve some expensive problems.
But a first major test, a national auction of rights to emit sulfur from power plant smokestacks, was received with something less than enthusiasm last month. And by no coincidence, the state regulators who can make or break the trading system are viewing its birth with deep suspicion. Champions of "marketable emissions allowances" are now worried that their baby will be smothered in the crib. 
 Since pollution is bad for children, trees and other living things, it would be nice -- and might be crucial -- to have less of it. But how to get from here to there? The traditional approach is command-and-control: Tell polluters what standard they must meet, and perhaps even dictate the technology.
Brute force works. America's air and water are far cleaner than they were two decades ago. But brute force is expensive -- well in excess of $100 billion a year, by the Environmental Protection Agency's reckoning, and rising far more rapidly than the G.N.P. That is why an unlikely coalition of environmentalists and conservatives fought for a more flexible system for halving the sulfur emissions dumped on forests and lakes downwind.
Power plants can cut emissions by encouraging energy conservation, by switching to low-sulfur fuels or by snatching sulfur particles from exhaust gases with chemical "scrubbers." But the cost varies greatly according to the location and age of the plants. So the logical approach is to let the utilities choose their own strategies. And the logical extension of the logical approach is to let utilities pool their efforts by creating free markets in emission rights.
Under the Clean Air Act of 1990, utilities may meet the sulfur standard on their own, or buy allowances to emit sulfur by the ton from utilities that exceed the standard. Polluters are even allowed to squirrel away unused allowances for future use or sale.
A half-dozen trades have already been privately consummated between consenting utilities. However, the first public auction came only on March 30, when the Chicago Board of Trade offered a big block of allowances controlled by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The auction was not a failure: Washington sold out its inventory. But it was hardly a smashing success. Prices were a small fraction of the estimated cost of meeting the standard with scrubbers, evidence that utilities are not focusing on least-cost approaches to meeting the standard. Moreover, virtually none of the allowances offered privately were sold, suggesting that everyone is wary of playing the new game.
Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, partly blames the arcane auction rules thoughtlessly dictated by Congress. But Mr. Lave and just about everyone else rooting for the system agree that state regulators are also undermining its chances.
Utility commissions in Midwestern states that produce high-sulfur coal are pressuring local utilities to install expensive scrubbers, presumably to keep miners employed and mines profitable. As disturbing, most commissions have failed to spell out who bears the risk in utility compliance strategies.
If a company buys allowances now for $500 a ton, will its stockholders be forced to eat part of the cost if prices later fall to $300? By the same token, if a utility decides to scrub, will it be penalized if it cannot sell the allowances generated for a high enough price to have justified the decision? "Nobody knows," laments Mr. Lave, and thus no utility is sticking its neck out.
A more direct challenge to sulfur emissions trading is coming from Thomas C. Jorling, New York's State's environment commissioner. Mr. Jorling fears utilities in the Ohio Valley will pay up rather than clean up, leaving the Adirondacks to cope with more sulfuric rain. He wants to inhibit interregional trading and, in particular, to stop the sale of allowances to plants upwind of New York.
The Environmental Defense Fund challenges his premise. There simply are not enough allowances out there to make it practical for Midwestern utilities to avoid a major cleanup, argues Joseph Goffman, a lawyer for the fund. And he thinks that the Jorling ploy could boomerang, inhibiting these same utilities from pursuing aggressive cleanup strategies in the 1990's to ease their burden in the next century.
But the deeper objection to Mr. Jorling's crusade is that he is trying to wriggle out of a hard-won deal that balanced the interests of region against region and environmentalism against economic growth.
"The Midwest is taking it in the neck to save the Adirondacks," Mr. Goffman said. It is a wretched precedent, he suggests, to stop the region's utilities from using the law to minimize the cost.

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
New Public Housing, French Vintage 1922

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
YOUNG architects are supposed to make a splash. It's a letdown when their first building doesn't herald a new voice. But Jean Dubus, 41, and Jean Pierre Lott, 31, have done something truly original. Their first work, an apartment building in Paris, reverberates with the shock of the old.
They've dusted off an unbuilt 1922 design for public housing by Le Corbusier, one of the most influential voices in 20th-century architecture, and brought it startlingly to life. What makes their debut even more stunning is that, after 70 years, the design still looks fresh. Not a dim echo, it's the bold refrain of an idea whose time has come again. 
 This building should be of special interest to Americans, in part because Le Corbusier was a prophet more honored in the United States than in France. Twenty-five years ago, before the Federal Government had withdrawn its support for subsidized housing, Le Corbusier was the major influence on the design of public housing in the United States. That influence was not altogether benign.
Le Corbusier's proposals to rebuild cities as complexes of tall "towers in a park" was alluring in theory. But in practice it was a bomb dropped on traditional urban form. While the concept produced some successes, like New York University's housing complex at Bleecker Street and La Guardia Place, designed in 1966 by I. M. Pei & Partners, more often it resulted in bleak public housing projects that disfigured many American cities and became warehouses for the poor.
It's time to take another look. Social housing is on its way back in the United States. In his confirmation hearings, Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, pledged that his agency would resume housing construction. Architects are calling once again for socially responsible work. Architecture schools, like those at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Parsons School of Design, are devoting conferences to public housing issues.
Those issues are not limited to design. Public housing depends on public policy. But design has a role to play, and so does architectural history. Mr. Dubus and Mr. Lott have looked to the tradition of social housing as an inspiration for the present. They've taken a flawed design and made it work.
I came upon this remarkable building at the end of a long day spent trekking through government-sponsored housing projects. The day was long because looking at social housing can bring on a tiring mix of emotions. Envy for a city that recognizes the importance of providing housing for the middle class. Admiration for the high quality of the designs, which are usually chosen in juried competitions. And not least, a heavy dose of guilt for wishing one were elsewhere, for any tourist with only a few days to spend in Paris would gladly trade in the city's entire stock of a social housing for an afternoon at the Louvre.
Sure, it's great to see all the terrific things young architects are doing with windows these days. But it's only 20 minutes to closing time at Ste.-Chappelle. Taxi!
"Patience," advised my guide, a young French architect named Jean Mas. "There's one more building I'd like to show you."
We zipped down to south Paris, to a neighborhood not far from the site where the horrible new Grande Bibliotheque, now under construction, is poking a quartet of towers into the sky. We pulled into a side street off Porte d'Italie and screeched to a halt beside the architectural apparition that arose before us. "See?" Mr. Mas asked. "It looks familiar?"
Mais oui. To the student of modern architecture, Le Corbusier's "Villa Immeubles" is as familiar as the Eiffel Tower. Designed in 1922, this was Le Corbusier's most ambitious project to date. With it, he applied the principles of modern architecture to the task of city planning, enlarging to urban scale his concept of the house as a "machine for living."
First sketched out on the back of a restaurant menu, the design was exhibited later that year at the Salon d'Automne, where the public got its first look at Le Corbusier's ambition to transform his adopted city of Paris into a machine-age utopia.
The concept was simple. Duplex maisonettes, each with its own outdoor garden, were arranged in rows of 24, then stacked atop one another in long blocks five double-stories tall. In one version of the plan, the blocks were arranged in quadrangles around a central garden.
The private "hanging gardens," which alternated with two-story living rooms enclosed by large glass walls, faced onto this public space. On the rear side of the block, open corridors (Le Corbusier called them "streets in the air") provided access to the units. City traffic was routed underground. Laundry and meal services would be provided, as in a grand hotel.
The Villas Immeubles project preceded by a few years Le Corbusier's radical proposal to rebuild Paris as a city of "towers in a park," and was actually quite traditional in scale and organization. Inspired by the architect's visit to a Carthusian monastery outside Florence, this "park inside a square" resembled a stripped-down version of the Palais Royale.
Mr. Dubus and Mr. Lott's explicit homage to a dead modernist is not quite the polemical act it may seem. It was the French housing authority's idea to call on architects to submit designs in the spirit of Le Corbusier, for a competition held in 1987, the centennial of the architect's birth.
But Mr. Dubus and Mr. Lott were delighted to get into the spirit. Like many young architects today, they believe that the paths opened up by the pioneer modernists have not reached a dead end. Nor, like some of their American counterparts, do they believe that it is desirable or even possible to detach modern forms from progressive social goals. The notion that one can have modernism without utopianism would strike them as absurd, indeed unnecessary, since they are fortunate to live in a nation that has not allowed privatization to dissolve the public realm.
Their building is not a shelter for the homeless. Like most social housing in central Paris, the project is designed for lower-middle-class families. A mix of government subsidies -- for land acquisition, construction costs and rent supports -- enables the housing authority to rent the units for about 30 percent below market value. Eligibility is based on income and family size. Of the building's 95 apartments, 11 are reserved for artists, who also receive subsidies.
Completed a year ago and now fully occupied, the Villa Immeubles is a homage but not a copy. Mr. Dubus and Mr. Lott have modified Le Corbusier's design and, in fact, substantially improved it.
Their block is only a quarter of the quadrangle Le Corbusier envisioned. There are no hotel services, and in place of sunken roadways, there is an underground garage for about 300 cars. These alterations help to integrate the building comfortably into the existing context of streets and small local shops. It does not stand alone like a walled compound.
Mr. Dubus and Mr. Lott have also modified the internal organization of the apartments and the garden facade on which that organization is expressed. Instead of alternating stiffly between an open terrace and an enclosed living room, the design doubles the rhythm. The living rooms are joined in pairs horizontally within glazed vertical shafts, while the gardens are carried (again in pairs) on concrete bridges that stretch between the shafts. This arrangement leaves room for a wide, open well behind the terraces, through which air and natural light flow into the building's interior.
But the most radical change from the original is the building's circulation. Instead of arranging the "streets in the air" along the exterior rear wall, the architects have run them straight through the building's heart. But they have not fully enclosed them. One side, planted with greenery, opens onto the air well and the terraces. And instead of placing these corridors even with the terraces, the architects have set them on a level halfway between them.
This organization creates a spectacularly rich spatial and social composition. The apartments are entered through a small vestibule that leads to a bedroom in the rear. Depending on the layout, a Le Corbusier-style spiral staircase either ascends or descends from the vestibule to a main floor with more than double the floor area.
The master bedroom and bath are here, next to a small sitting area that can be used as an extra bedroom. A kitchen and dining area occupy the central core of the apartment, and in half of the apartments these are placed on a balcony overlooking the living room with its atelier-style window. A door leads off from the living room to the terrace. The openness of these interiors is a striking contrast to the warren of mazes common in American housing projects.
The prospect outside the "villas" is even more extraordinary. Walking along the streets in the air, one passes through a rhythmic sequence of enclosing walls and open air, gazing past the private terraces toward a public garden below. The result is a masterful weaving of form and sociology, supremely urban in its clear articulation of private, semi-private and public space. It is thrilling to reflect on the difference such a design can make in the lives of families and communities.
Heavy balcony railings mar the fluid space inside the apartments, and the stairs would have benefited from having open risers. Traditional furniture looks surprisingly at home inside these classically white modern rooms. In several living rooms, the airy delicacy of old-fashioned lace curtains makes the perfect foil for the broad expanse of glass.
In the building's public areas, the palette of white and gray is relieved with patches of dusty green and rose. At dusk, in a gem of a detail, the corridors are suffused with mellow light from small halogen lamps set into the floor. Then, the entire building takes on the glow of a dream rekindled.

HEADLINE: In North Korea, Try Diplomacy First

 BODY:
North Korea's abrupt refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear sites has now led the International Atomic Energy Agency to take the unprecedented step of asking the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions.
But diplomacy may still be the best way to keep North Korea from getting The Bomb. The task is to persuade Pyongyang to reverse its rash renunciation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and open all its nuclear sites to inspections. 
 Inspections would enable the I.A.E.A. to tell whether Pyongyang has produced enough plutonium to make a bomb. They could also assure that its nuclear reactors are not diverted to bomb-making.
The I.A.E.A.'s call for sanctions is understandable. But whatever economic leverage the U.N. has with autarkic North Korea depends on China's willingness to enforce an embargo and deny it oil. China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, favors "patient consultations" instead, though he does not rule out sanctions if diplomacy fails.
Some in Washington are urging more forceful steps. But attacking Iraq's nuclear facilities failed to put it out of the bomb-making business. And bombing the North's reactors would invite retaliation against nuclear power plants in South Korea, if not all-out war. That understandably frightens Seoul, which prefers to try diplomacy. And it feels North Korea may be amenable to compromise.
Pyongyang's double-dealing doesn't help. But the North's conditions for continued adherence to the Nonproliferation Treaty do not seem impossible to satisfy. Pyongyang wants an end to the Team Spirit exercises conducted by the U.S. and South Korea. It wants to inspect bases in the South to assure that no U.S. nuclear arms remain. It seeks assurances that Washington will not use nuclear arms first. And it wants high-level talks with Washington to resolve the nuclear issue.
Before resorting to sanctions or force, Washington should exhaust diplomacy. It has until at least mid-June to try; that's when the North's withdrawal from the treaty would take effect. Pyongyang can do little to advance its nuclear ambition by then. If diplomacy fails, sterner measures may then be easier to sell to Beijing and Seoul.

Not 'Ready to Go'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Bob Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, chose Oregon's Mark Hatfield, a soft-spoken moderate, to talk to Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter about signing the filibuster letter.
Comes April 30, it will be seen as a critical moment in the first hundred days of the Clinton Administration. To stop the Democratic legislative locomotive, solidarity on the part of the Republican minority was vital, and Hatfield and Specter have long been mavericks. 
 The Pennsylvania Senator listened to the argument against Mr. Clinton's bill to stimulate the economy by increasing the deficit by $19.5 billion in new Federal spending. He asked to read the final draft of the letter, and signed on -- not as a party regular but as a Senator profoundly offended by the steamroller tactics of the Democratic leadership.
Senator Robert Byrd, the Appropriations chairman, had been eager to reassert his power after failing last year to move the C.I.A. to his native West Virginia. Against Senate tradition, he used parliamentary tricks to make it impossible for any senator to amend the President's spending bill.
But the Senate was created to protect the minority against majority tyranny. That's why small states have the same two votes as large states and why it takes much more than a majority to cut off debate. Senator Byrd, who burdens us all with taxpayer-subsidized books about Senate traditions, forgot about that respect for dissent and compromise in his zeal to ram through the whole Democratic "stimulus" without examination of each of its components.
The Republicans were driven into unaccustomed unity. As a result of the all-or-nothing demand of Bobby Byrd and the hubris of the Clinton White House, the addition to the deficit of billions in political payoffs to mayors who delivered for Democratic candidates is a dead duck.
Liberal media are apoplectic. "It is the rightful role of the minority to oppose and criticize," huffs a New York Times editorialist, "but not to paralyze." In other words, it's O.K. for the minority to complain, but to insist on a role in making national decisions -- why, that's causing the dreaded "gridlock."
Now we'll have a much-needed debate. On the surface, it will be about the pork permeating this particular bill, which is based on the "Ready to Go" wish list supplied by the Conference of Mayors. We will see if the taxpayer wants to shell out $1 million for the casino in West Haven, Conn., $500,000 for a bike path in Minneapolis, $80,000 for tennis courts in Perth Amboy, N.J., and similar goodies for loyal pols and their contractor contributors.
In the glare of publicity, many of these costly political favors will be deleted from the bill when it is reconsidered. So will billions in grants to students, which have nothing to do with the quick creation of new jobs, supposedly Mr. Clinton's purpose in submitting this legislation.
But under the surface is the greater debate: What did the voters say in the 1992 election?
Did we change parties to stimulate the economy by providing government jobs, thereby -- claim the Clintonites -- enlarging the deficit today in the hope of reducing it someday? Or did the majority vote to reduce the crushing deficit that had quadrupled in the past 12 years?
I think the voters' villain was the deficit. Add the Perot protesters to the Republican die-hards and you have a mandate to reduce the deficit -- to cut it in half in four years, as candidate Clinton promised. To that 57 percent of the electorate, add those of us who voted to oust the hapless Bushies after being assured that Clinton would be a "new kind of Democrat."
Clinton's post-election leftward lunge has led to a political paradox: the great majority who wanted to get off the spend-and-tax treadmill is not being represented by the majority party.
We don't need to go deeper into deficit to pump up the economy. That will continue to come back by itself, unless heavy new taxes and all the Clinton hints of price control spook the current recovery.
The filibuster that stopped the "Ready to Go" payoff reminds Clinton and the rubber-stamping-ground that has become the Congress: The American majority will rule, even if it has to be represented for the time being by a Senate minority.

HEADLINE: Tough Talk Won't Help Trade With Japan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"For Clinton, 'Managed Trade' Is Emerging as Policy Option" (front page, March 30) exposes the faulty thinking and naivete of "strategic trade" and "aggressive unilateralism." United States trade deficits are made by chronic budget deficits and low savings in the United States, not by Japan or other Asian countries.
United States trade deficits with Japan consist mainly of products Americans want eagerly but that are not made here -- fax machines, flat liquid-crystal panels, compact disk players, even quality cars, to name a few. This situation is the same as Japan's unabated imports of Hollywood films and American pop music. Can such imbalances be corrected by ill-conceived managed trade? 
 The Clinton Administration has mistakenly embraced the United States-Japan semiconductor agreement of the Bush-Reagan era as the way to reduce trade deficits with Japan. All that you have to do, managed-trade advocates say, is demand, under threat of unilateral retaliation, that Japan set aside a dictated portion of the target market, like 20 percent of the microchips market. This magic number was recently reached. But a simple analysis of it would show the opposite conclusion.
Only because Japan's deepening recession shrank the total market size of microchips, and only because this market shrinkage did not deter the rising popularity of Intel's central processing unit chips in Japan, was the target of 20 percent passed. Intel's chips would have continued to sell well without political protection. The successes of Intel, Texas Instruments and other American companies in Japan point up the simple truth of international trade in high-tech-related products.
If you back technically superior products with marketing and manufacturing investments in targeted foreign markets, you can sell them there. Unfortunately, the cheapening of the dollar has made investment by American companies in Japan prohibitively expensive. The cheaper dollar has helped United States trade with Europe only because American manufacturers have long had manufacturing and marketing operations for European customers. America's trade deficits with Japan do not prove closure of markets by Japan.
Furthermore, the school of "aggressive unilateralism" assumes Japan cannot retaliate. Japan has plenty to retaliate with. American steel companies have discovered that their operations in the United States have been seriously hurt by the withdrawal of massive technical and financial aids from their Japanese steel partners. One Japanese steel company after another was hurt by the harassment of "dumping" suits from American steel companies last year. Japanese companies seem to have concluded they can use their technology and money more safely elsewhere.
If Detroit's Big Three mimic steel industry harassment of Japanese companies, they would find themselves hurt in the United States and in Japan. President Clinton's managed trade advocates should go back to the drawing board.

HEADLINE: Trade Center Blast Providing Economic Lift, Experts Find

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
In the first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of the economic damage caused by the bombing of the World Trade Center, Port Authority economists and consultants have concluded that the explosion has actually provided a lift to the local economy.
The attack -- which killed six people and injured 1,000 others -- wreaked havoc on the fabric of the city and authority officials did not suggest that news of economic benefit would undo the tragedy of it. 
 But in a report issued yesterday, the authority said that because of insurance claims, the reconstruction and cleanup effort was largely being financed from outside the region, supplying jobs to people who lived nearby.
 
Discomfort Shows
 They estimated that the economic activity generated by the terrorist attack would bring more than $200 million into the regional economy.
Officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey made no secret of their discomfort with the interpretation that the bombing was good for the economy. And, they were quick to point out that their analysis does not account for the intangible losses associated with the bombing deaths and injuries, or for the emotional trauma to tens of thousands of other New Yorkers affected by the blast. And in any case, they said, the estimated lift is small compared with the region's $470 billion economy.
In addition, they said the long-term impact is hard to measure. The costs of higher insurance premiums and increased security for the trade center should not be onerous, they said. But it is not yet clear whether the perceived risks of doing business in the area will make the trade center complex less competitive in the crowded national market for commercial real estate.
In their report, Port Authority officials place the cost of business disruption and reconstruction at just under $600 million. That figure is in the same range as a March 1 estimate issued by the New York City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman.
But the Port Authority expects that all but $50 million to $100 million of out-of-pocket costs to business, local government and the authority will be reimbursed from private insurance and Federal emergency assistance. And the loss of employment, notably some 900 jobs at the shuttered Vista Hotel and the Windows on the World restaurant, will be more than offset by added construction and cleanup payrolls.
Reconstruction and cleanup costs, by the Port Authority's reckoning, will exceed $300 million. And just after the bombing, there was speculation that dislocation of businesses and the 50,000-plus people who work in the trade center would cost several times that much. The Port Authority now estimates that this loss will come to less than $200 million -- good news that Port Authority Chairman Richard Leone attributes to planning, much effort and good luck.
Both public agencies and private contractors, he noted, "worked at supersonic speeds" with the cleanup and emergency repairs. Government permits that routinely take months were issued on the spot. With a green light from insurers, cleanup crews were set to work 24 hours a day to prepare the buildings for reopening.
Perhaps as important, the current glut in city office space made it possible for some 350 businesses to relocate within days. "If this had happened in 1985 or 1986," in the midst of the real-estate boom, Mr. Leone pointed out, the recovery would have been drawn out and far more costly.
Unlike most natural disasters, the great bulk of the damage was done to business property. Thus almost all of the loss, including the disruption of businesses, was insured.
Of the estimated $132 million to $160 million in financial damage to trade center tenants, all but $7 million to $25 million is likely to be reimbursed. Of the Port Authority's own estimated $376 million to $380 million loss, just $20 million to $22 million will come out of the authority's resources -- a trivial sum in the context of the authority's $2 billion-plus annual budgets. While an exact comparison is not possible, these numbers seem consistent with the total $510 million private insurance liability estimated last week by the American Insurance Services Group, an industry-financed association.
Government outlays for emergency services, of course, were not insured. But now that President Clinton has declared New York eligible for disaster relief, a good chunk of the $22 million to $39 million borne in large part by states and localities should be underwritten by Washington.
 
50,000 Workers Displaced
 The Port Authority's more challenging task was to estimate the broader economic impact on the region. And here the authority relied on plausible assumptions -- in particular, that the insurance reimbursement largely came from pockets outside the region and that the bulk of the reconstruction and cleanup went to local contractors and workers.
Some 50,000 to 55,000 workers were displaced by the trade center closing. In most cases, though, they were quickly back at work. And while there are some serious losers -- in particular, employees of the Windows on the World restaurant and the Vista Hotel who will be laid off for many months -- their wage losses are overwhelmed by the earnings of thousands employed in the fast-track reconstruction effort. What is more, Matthew Drennen, an economist at Cornell and consultant to the Port Authority, estimates that a good portion of this net earnings gain will be spent within the region, creating more jobs.
But the net stimulus is short-lived. A chunk of the benefit will certainly be offset by higher property insurance premiums and higher building security costs in the future. And if access to the trade center garage is restricted, the loss of parking revenues could be considerable. Last, but hardly least, some analysts worry that the bombing will make downtown Manhattan in general, and the World Trade Center in particular, a less prestigious place to work.
That apparently explains why Port Authority officials are determined to restore the buildings to better-than-new condition, emphasizing the agency's optimistic stance and minimizing reminders of the bombing.

HEADLINE: Richard B. Stearns Jr., 54, Dies; Managed Real-Estate Investments

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Richard B. Stearns Jr. a real-estate investment executive, died on Tuesday night at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 54 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan.
The cause was cancer of the bladder, said his brother-in-law Cecil Wray. 
 Mr. Stearns managed a portfolio of real estate valued at more than $15 billion when he was chairman, from 1989 to 1991, of Prudential Real Estate Investors, which is based in Newark. It is part of the Prudential Insurance Company of America, also based in Newark.
Of the total, $10 billion worth of real estate was owned by the Prudential, and more than $5 billion was owned by other institutional investors, mostly pension funds.
He joined the insurance company, which is the country's largest, in 1981 and became chairman or chief executive of three other Newark-based Prudential real-estate and mortgage units.
 
Involved in Schools
 Over the years, Mr. Stearns was also a director or trustee of the Brearley School, an independent school for girls, and the Diller-Quaile School of Music, both in Manhattan; the New York School for the Deaf, in White Plains; the Interracial Council for Business Opportunity, and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Managers.
He was born in Stamford, Conn., grew up in New Hampshire, and graduated from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, N.H. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Colgate University in 1960 and a master's degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1961.
After serving as a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank and of Gulf & Western Industries and as treasurer of Schlumberger Ltd., he joined the Prudential, as a vice president.
He founded Prudential Home Mortgage Company in 1984 and oversaw its burgeoning operations in its first five years. The company, which was a joint venture with Salomon Brothers from 1984 to 1988, is now the second-largest originator of home mortgages in the United States. From several offices across the country, it issues mortgages to individual home buyers. In 1992 it originated more than $28 billion worth of mortgages.
 
Director of Several Companies
 In early 1992, after a reorganization of the Prudential Realty Group, Mr. Stearns was the chief executive officer of Institutional Investment Management -- a Newark-based division of the Realty Group -- which manages commercial real-estate investments, mostly for pension funds.
Last year, Mr. Stearns left Prudential and became a managing director of Security Capital Group, a closely held corporation that invests in real estate, using pools of capital provided by investors, and also manages investments in real estate. In addition he was a managing director of several affiliated companies.
He is survived by his mother, Barbara Stearns, of New London, N.H.; his wife, the former Sharon Gates, to whom he was married in 1968; a son, Owen Johnson Stearns, and two daughters, Hope Gates Stearns and Leigh Asher Stearns, all of Manhattan, and a sister, Ruth Santos, of Larchmont.

HEADLINE: RUSSIA REBUFFS U.S. ON TOUGHER MOVES AGAINST BELGRADE

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 8

 BODY:
Underscoring the international community's problems in pushing through even modest measures to punish the Serbs for resisting a peace accord for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia refused today to accept a toughened set of American-sponsored sanctions against Belgrade.
In a threat to Washington's hopes for a positive vote on the new sanctions at the United Nations on Monday, Russia told the Security Council that it cannot agree to their main points: seizing Yugoslav transport equipment, banning all ships entering Yugoslav waters and more strictly enforcing an existing trade embargo. 
 Russia's representative at the United Nations, Yuli M. Voronstov, said he would consult with Moscow over the weekend and report its decision before the Council votes on Monday morning. It was unclear whether Russia would merely abstain or break with the United States for the first time since the end of the cold war by using its veto to block the resolution for new sanctions.
 
No Military Sentiment
 There is no sentiment at the Council for military action to punish Serbia, beyond the measures already approved to enforce a no-flight rule over Bosnia that has no military importance.
Perhaps trying to take advantage of the Russian move, and also to forestall a Council vote, the Bosnian Serbs sent a letter to the United Nations mediators contending that their position had been "misrepresented" and saying that they wanted to reopen negotiations on the peace plan in Geneva.
After the Bosnian Serb decision last Friday and Saturday not to sign the United Nations-sponsored peace plan, the Clinton Administration said it wanted to get a prompt Security Council resolution further tightening the economic sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, the two remaining republics that make up Yugoslavia. That vote was put off until Monday to accommodate a Russian request.
The Russian position appeared to reflect the quandary posed for President Boris N. Yeltsin by the drive to strengthen the trade blockade of Yugoslavia. The effort by Washington to get sanctions is based on the hope that the move would force Belgrade to end the fighting in Bosnia by pressing its Serbian allies there to reverse themselves and accept the peace plan.
 
Sensitive Issue in Moscow
 For Russia to vote in favor of such additional sanctions would infuriate President Yeltsin's opponents in the Russian Parliament and elsewhere who contend that Russia has an obligation to back its Serbian "brothers," who share the Orthodox religion. The issue is particularly sensitive because of the April 25 referendum testing Mr. Yeltsin's political power. If Mr. Yeltsin holds firm against the additional sanctions, it could produce a Russian veto. That would annoy his Western backers and jeopardize billions of dollars of aid he hopes to receive in coming months. But an abstention might lead the Serbs to believe that they have stronger Russian backing than they actually have and encourage their defiance.
The Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, wrote today to the two Balkan mediators, Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, saying he wants to reopen direct peace negotiators with them and Bosnia's Muslim and Croat leaders in Geneva as soon as possible. Mr. Vance, the former Secretary of State, is due to step down soon and be replaced by Thorvald Stoltenberg, Norway's former Foreign Minister.
Contending that the Bosnian Serb refusal to accept the peace plan has been "widely misrepresented," Dr. Karadzic said, "We should like you to know we are ready for the resumption of the Geneva talks as soon as possible. The time has come for direct talks among the sides to the conflict on the basis of the positive achievements so far."
But the United States, Britain, France and other countries supporting tighter trade controls on Yugoslavia say they still want to press ahead with a vote on the new resolution next Monday unless Russia threatens to block it by using its veto as a permanent Council member.
Russia's United Nations representative, Yuli M. Vorontsov, told the Security Council this morning that speedy adoption of a new sanctions resolution is not necessary because the cease-fire in Bosnia is holding and because Vitaly I. Churkin, Russia's special envoy dealing with the Yugoslavian crisis, has reported progress in the talks he held with the Yugoslav leadership in Belgrade on Wednesday.
Mr. Churkin, the Deputy Foreign Minister, is expected here later this week to discuss his Belgrade talks with Council members and the mediators.
America's United Nations representative, Madeleine K. Albright, with support from Britain and France, expressed surprise and irritation at the abrupt change in the Russian attitude. The change came after extensive consultations on Wednesday, when Mr. Vorontsov made no mention of the reservations he suddenly raised today.
Russia also submitted a list of amendments to the new draft resolution that are designed to reverse the tightening of the trade embargo proposed by the United States, Britain and France. Most other members now favor tightening the embargo, following the Bosnian Serbs' rejection last week of the Vance-Owen peace plan, which the Croats and Muslims have accepted.
 
Sticking Point on Imports
 Mr. Vorontsov expressed opposition to new plans to ban all shipping from the Yugoslavian Federation's territorial waters and to tighten controls over cargo boats sailing the Danube through its territory. He suggested that Yugoslavia be allowed to import essential humanitarian goods more easily.
At first Britain and France wanted the new resolution to give strong endorsement to the Vance-Owen plan. And they hoped the Council would adopt it last Friday or Saturday just before the Bosnian Serbs' parliament met to decide whether to follow the Muslims' example and agree to the peace proposals.
But the Clinton Administration refused to support an unqualified endorsement of the Vance-Owen proposal, which it once criticized as rewarding Serbian "ethnic cleansing," although it offered no alternative. In the end it would only agree to say that the Council "commends" the plan and "calls on" the Serbs to accept it too.
 
Sought Postponement
 The American Administration then called for the vote to be postponed a second time, until after President Clinton's Vancouver summit meeting with President Yeltsin, saying that it also wanted time to strengthen the sanctions.
The original text sought a ban on all shipments of goods through Yugoslavia; new restrictions on freighters moving down the Danube; impoundment of all Yugoslavian ships, planes and trains in foreign countries, and a freeze on Belgrade's overseas financial assets.
In addition, the United States suggested banning all ships from entering Yugoslavian territorial waters, imposing even tighter control over ships moving on the Danube through Yugoslavia and freezing Yugoslavian-owned buildings and land in foreign countries as well as financial assets. It also proposed that the sanctions take effect as soon as they are voted instead of 15 days later.
But Britain, France and Russia succeeded in retaining the 15-day grace period and watering down the plan to take over Yugoslavian real estate and land. Only Russia objected to declaring a naval exclusion zone in Yugoslavia's territorial waters.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
NATO READY ON FLIGHT BAN

 PARIS, April 8 (Special to The New York Times) -- NATO gave the go-ahead today for warplanes from the United States, France and the Netherlands to start enforcing the United Nations ban on flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina beginning on Monday.
The 16-nation alliance, which agreed to carry out the enforcement last week, approved a detailed operational plan at a meeting today in its Brussels headquarters. "Everything is in place," said NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Woerner. "We have already started to deploy."
NATO sources said 24 fighters from the United States, 14 from France and 18 from the Netherlands, would participate initially. Their pilots will have authority to shoot down aircraft that violate the zone over which flights have been banned if they ignore warnings to leave the area and return to their bases.
 
 
 
BALKAN UPDATE
 The commander of the United Nations military force in BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA abandoned his effort yesterday to reach the besieged Muslim enclave at SREBRENICA after hundreds of Serbs blocked his convoy on the road between ZVORNIK and BRATUNAC. The commander, Lieut. Gen. Philippe Morillon of France, was to be accompanied by 150 Canadian troops from VISOKO who were to reinforce the small United Nations garrison in the enclave.
In another setback to United Nations relief efforts in Bosnia, Serbian soldiers searching a truck carrying flour to a Muslim suburb of SARAJEVO discovered 5,000 rounds of ammunition hidden in 48 boxes beneath the flour sacks. The United Nations said the ammunition had been placed aboard the vehicle by unknown people in an attempt to discredit the relief operations.
Suggesting that Yugoslavia had been supporting Serbian forces in Bosnia, the World Court, in THE HAGUE, urged the Belgrade Government to insure that any forces it controls in Bosnia do not violate the 1948 convention banning genocide. Although Bosnia won an implicit condemnation of Yugoslavia, it failed to persuade the Court to take immediate compensatory action.
In BONN, a court ruled that German military personnel could remain on NATO air surveillance planes that will help enforce a United Nations ban on Serbian military flights over Bosnia.
At the UNITED NATIONS, Russia refused to accept a toughened set of American-sponsored sanctions against the Yugoslav Government in BELGRADE, telling the Security Council that it cannot agree to the main points of a plan that calls for seizing of Yugoslav transport equipment, a ban on all ships entering Yugoslav waters, and stricter enforcement of an exisiting trade embargo.
And in WASHINGTON, a senior Defense Department official insisted that the use of limited force to stop Serbian attacks in Bosnia had not yet been ruled out.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Proposes a 2-Year Freeze On New York City's Water Rates

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Responding to fierce complaints of higher water bills in New York City, the Dinkins administration proposed a two-year freeze on water and sewer rates yesterday and a ceiling on those rates in the two years after that.
The Mayor said his proposal would cut water bills by $188 million during the next two years, or more than $100 for the average homeowner. The city had forecast that water rates would increase by 7 percent in the next fiscal year and 10 percent in the following year. 
 New York will be able to afford the freeze, city officials said, by using water-bill surpluses from the 1992 fiscal year and from another surplus it expects this year, which ends June 30. The city also expects to save through conservation measures and cost-cutting steps that the administration announced yesterday.
Although money from such surpluses must be spent on water and sewage operations under city bond rules, Mr. Dinkins could have chosen to use the money to upgrade sewage plants or on other capital projects. But in this election year, the Mayor has decided instead to use the money to prevent increases in water bills, thus producing savings where they are likely to have a big impact on middle-class residents and building owners.
 
Sharp Jump in Rates
 The sharp jump in water and sewage rates has been a problem for the Dinkins administration, which has been wrestling with ways to curb the increases during the last few years. Five years ago, during the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, the city began installing meters in every house and apartment building to encourage conservation by making consumers pay for the water they actually used. Previously, owners had paid fixed rates. The meter-installation project, coupled with the cost of refurbishing treatment plants, helped to push water rates higher.
In the last two years, the average water bill increased 30 percent. Some housing advocates have complained that low-income residents, who often live where pipes are old or faulty and leaks are prevalent, were particularly hard hit.
Mr. Dinkins has been under pressure from housing advocates, homeowners and building owners to reverse the trend. And there has been concern at City Hall that the increasing cost of water would help to paint New York as an undesirable place for businesses.
The average single-family home in New York City now pays $350 in water and sewage charges, up from $220 in the 1990 fiscal year. The city had forecast that bills would have increased to $420 in fiscal 1994 and $593 by fiscal 1997.
The Mayor's proposal would freeze water rates at their present level for next year and 1995 and establish a ceiling of $750 a year for single-family homes in the two fiscal years beginning in 1996. Two-family homes would pay no more than $1,250 a year; six-family homes would be limited to $3,250 a year.
The Mayor's proposal is subject to the approval of the New York City Water Board, an independent seven-member group responsible for setting water rates. The Dinkins administration will present the plan to the board next week and hearings will take place during the next few weeks. Mayoral aides say they expect the proposal to be approved at the water board's May 11 meeting.
 
Proposal for Spring
 In a news conference at City Hall to announce the proposal yesterday, Barbara J. Fife, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, said the timing of the announcement was a result of the requirement that the Mayor propose a water rate to the board each spring.
Responding to questions on whether the announcement was politically motivated, Ms. Fife said: "This is a move to provide some relief to the people of the City of New York. If it were political, we wouldn't have taken an action that would affect the next few years. We would have done a one-shot deal."
The Mayor also announced cost-saving moves to help pay for the rate freeze. They include a rebate program for bill payers who undertake various water-saving measures and another for customers who fit their bathrooms with water-conserving fixtures. The program, which will begin in the Bronx in September, will provide a rebate of as much as $240 for each bathroom fitted with the new fixtures.
 
Extending Flat Rates
 In addition, the Mayor announced that the city would extend a program allowing recently metered buildings to continue to pay flat-rate charges for an interim period and that it would eliminate a surcharge on industrial waste paid by businesses.
Albert F. Appleton, Commissioner of the City Department of Environmental Protection, said that his department had been able to save money in several areas. He said, for example, that the recession had kept the cost of capital projects far lower than original estimates and that interest payments had been lower than previously anticipated because of the refinancing of long-term debt.

HEADLINE: Future Doctors Unsettled By Health-Care Changes

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 8

 BODY:
In the library, at home, even between cuts in the operating room, the prospect of dramatic change in the health-care system is the talk among medical students in this city known as a mecca for future doctors because of its concentration of teaching hospitals and medical schools.
"We'll be in the O.R. taking out an extra pair of gloves, and someone will say, 'You're wasting those gloves, Hillary wouldn't like that,' " said Mark Brown, a fourth-year student at Tufts University School of Medicine.
 
Expecting Less Freedom
 Mr. Brown and his fellow students say they know they will have less freedom in their practices than their predecessors in the profession, who earned an average of $170,600 in 1991, and they expect to earn less money, particularly if they go into specialties like ophthalmology, radiology or cardiac surgery, which have traditionally been among the highest paid. They seem resigned to the end of what many refer to as the golden age of medicine. 
 But in interviews, two dozen medical students at Tufts were unanimous in saying that major change in the health-care system is long overdue.
They are worried that the national health-care plan, which is being developed by a task force headed by Hillary Rodham Clinton and is to be unveiled in May, will not fix what is wrong, or that it will only add to the bureaucracy that provokes some older doctors into warning them that they have picked the wrong career. Mostly a group of people who have been carefully planning their futures since childhood, the students are worried about the unknown.
 
'Like I'm in Limbo'
 "What kind of office am I going to have?" Monica Lumpkin, a third-year student who wants to go into family practice, asked over dinner with two classmates. "I feel like I'm in limbo. I don't like the sound of managed competition. It sounds too detached from public health. The doctor would be even more powerless."
Across the table was John Rhee, who has known since childhood that he would be a doctor, like his father and his grandfather. "Suddenly, there are all these restrictions being placed on doctors," Mr. Rhee said. "What about restrictions on lawyers? We have two lawyers in the White House."
 
Easing of Burden
 While the details have not been announced, President Clinton has said he favors managed competition, in which more doctors and patients join prepaid plans, like health maintenance organizations, that compete over price and quality. Administration officials have also spoken of price controls for doctors.
Ms. Lumpkin says she worries that H.M.O.'s might not offer patients the best care, or enough autonomy for doctors. But she also says that since she spends nearly every waking hour studying medicine she has not had time to learn much about H.M.O.'s.
Other students say that H.M.O.'s, or other group practices, might actually be a blessing, helping them balance career and family. One, Holly Gallivan, was inspired to become a doctor by her father, a thoracic surgeon, but says she does not want to be on call 24 hours, like her father. "I want to have time for my family," she said. "If I could have time, I'd sacrifice the big bucks. I don't expect to make a lot of money."
Many of the students have been spilling out their anxieties to professors like Dr. Sherwood L. Gorbach, who graduated from Tufts in 1962, when medical students had a nearly universal vision of their futures in private practice. For all their concerns, Dr. Gorbach said, he believes that today's students may ultimately be more satisfied with their profession than his former classmates who, at their 30th class reunion last year, were awash in bitterness over the Government's intrusions.
 
Money vs. Idealism
 "Today's students are entering without this expectation of free enterprise," he said. "They are being told that while their profession will always be well compensated, they are not going to make these fabulous salaries. When we interview students, we find they're coming for idealistic reasons."
Still, with skyrocketing medical school costs -- tuition at Tufts is $27,000 a year -- money is a central concern of students here, who will graduate with an average debt of $70,000. And while they may support reforms to extend care to all and limit costs, they do not necessarily want the changes to come at their expense.
"Everyone deserves health care," said Seth Linker, a fourth-year student who is planning to be an ear, nose and throat surgeon. "But I think I deserve to get back exactly that I put in: up to half a million dollars."
 
'Deserve to Be Compensated'
 If the experience of older doctors is a guide, Mr. Linker, who is also training as a plastic surgeon, could eventually earn well over $300,000 a year. "I think it's wrong to become wealthy off someone else's misery," he said. "On the other hand a part of me says: 'I worked hard. I'm six years behind my friends economically and socially. I deserve to be compensated.' "
But he added: "If the Government says I can't make over $100,000, I'm not going to scream." He also said he planned to provide free care to patients who could not pay.
David Goldberg, a fourth-year student who plans to pursue a career in invasive cardiology, was still in a state of disbelief last week over his exit interview with his financial aid adviser. "I owe $150,000," he said. "Depending on what Bill Clinton does, I could crash and burn. I've worked very hard, but I'm just a little scared."
Ahead for Mr. Goldberg is a residency at Yale-New Haven Hospital: three years of 100-hour weeks, with a $29,000 starting salary. Eventually, he expects to earn at least $200,000. "After putting in all this training and earning minimum wage for a long time," he said, "I deserve to be comfortable."
His comments, made in an informal discussion of health-care reform with 15 other students, provoked enormous dissent. "What does the world owe you?" demanded Peter C. Park, a second-year student, who intends to work as a family practitioner in the inner city, earning about $80,000 a year. "There are people living on the street."
When the students talk of the urgency of reform, their experiences shape the discussion. "I was working in an eye and ear infirmary, and this woman who was working a minimum-wage job came in needing an audiogram that costs $200," said Tim Pawlik, a second-year student who says he wants to practice in the inner city. "The secretary said, 'She doesn't have health insurance.' So she couldn't get the test."
Another second-year student, Karen Tarbell, said she had seen 9-year-olds at homeless shelters who have not received any immunizations.
Mark Brown frets about the waste he sees in hospitals. "We'll order a chest X-ray, and we can't find it," he said. "So what do we do? We order another one for another $60."
The students have plenty of ideas for Mrs. Clinton's task force. Sarah deFerranti thinks money could be saved by cutting back on high technology. "They should only have two M.R.I.'s per city," she said, referring to costly magnetic resonance imaging scanners, which many experts say are overused and which most hospitals in Boston have. "Let's put all our money into prevention, not technology."
Her classmate, Ms. Gallivan, agreed. But Boston, she said, is a city where it is hard not to become enthralled by technology. "Oh, boy, the toys they have in Boston," she said. "I went to the ophthalmologist the other day. He had a laser in his office, and all kinds of gadgets. I know that's very expensive, but still it was exciting."
President Clinton has talked about the need for more primary care doctors, such as those in family practice or pediatrics, who can provide more care at lower cost than specialists. So has Dr. Morton A. Madoff, the dean of the Tufts' medical school.
While a lot of first- and second-year students may talk about going into primary care, only 27 percent of each graduating class actually does. "They hear primary care getting denigrated," Dr. Madoff said. "They recognize the tremendous income disparity. They look at their debt rising."
Ms. Gallivan said primary care seems to violate the ethic that motivates so many Boston doctors and medical students. "You're always supposed to be doing the next-hardest thing," she said. And, this surgeon's daughter said, becoming a surgeon is the next-hardest thing.
Mr. Rhee, who is in his third year, is leaning toward one of the higher paid specialties, radiology -- a choice he says was influenced by his projected debt of more than $100,000.
All the uncertainty about incomes has apparently not helped the atmosphere in the operating room. Mark Brown was scrubbing up for a hernia repair when the chief resident asked him what specialty he had chosen. Ophthalmology, Mr. Brown replied.
The chief resident expressed resentment that ophthalmologists could make as much for a 30-minute cataract procedure as some surgeons do for three-hour operations, Mr. Brown said.
But the resident was aware that cataract surgery fees were likely to be cut. "He was very satisfied that I was going to make less money," Mr. Brown said. "Every specialty hates the others. We're about to be assaulted, and all we can do is pick on each other."

DOCTORS SEE NEED FOR REFORM
 BOSTON, April 8 (AP) -- A survey of doctors in the United States, Canada and the former West Germany found that a majority of them believe their health-care systems need reform.
The survey, directed by Dr. Robert J. Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health, was published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.
The survey found that 23 percent of doctors in the United States, 33 percent in Canada and 48 in Germany thought their health-care systems worked well.
The telephone survey was conducted in early 1991 and had responses from 602 Americans, 507 in Canadians and 519 in Germans. The margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET;
CLINTON OUTLINES SPENDING PACKAGE OF $1.52 TRILLION

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
President Clinton today sent Congress a $1.52 trillion budget full of new details showing how he wants to reduce the Government's deficit while spending more money on public works, education and retraining jobless workers.
In presenting its 1994 budget, the Administration acknowledged that domestic spending under Mr. Clinton's plan would exceed the limits that Congress set in 1990 and reaffirmed this year. But Mr. Clinton and his budget director, Leon E. Panetta, vowed to fight for their proposals. 
 Mr. Clinton's budget closely follows the blueprint he sketched in a speech to Congress on Feb. 17. But his appeal to Congress for deficit reduction was so effective that lawmakers, in their initial deliberations on the budget, outdid the President.
 
Some Proposals Jeopardized
 Their apparent zeal to control Government spending now jeopardizes some of Mr. Clinton's proposals to spend more on public works, education, job training and other domestic programs.
Like Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Mr. Clinton predicts that the budget deficit will decline -- in both absolute terms and as a share of the nation's total economic output -- if Congress follows his prescription. But Mr. Clinton's minutely detailed plan for the next five years takes no account of his ambitious proposals to overhaul the nation's health-care system.
Mr. Panetta asserted that those proposals, scheduled for submission to Congress this spring, would control health costs, slow the growth of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and further reduce the Federal budget deficit.
 
Republican Criticism
 But many people in and out of Government say the President's plan to guarantee health care for all Americans is just as likely to create big new demands on the Federal Treasury, which could drive the deficit far above the record $290 billion posted in 1992.
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said of Mr. Clinton's budget, "It's pretty much what they promised -- more taxes, more spending."
Mr. Panetta said: "It's a courageous budget. It asks every American -- senior citizens, Federal workers, doctors, hospitals, farmers, the wealthy, everyone -- to contribute to this effort to put this country back on the right track."
But Senator Dole, who helped organize a Republican filibuster against parts of Mr. Clinton's economic recovery plan, said, "People out there in the real world just don't understand how record-setting tax increases and a taxpayer-financed spending spree by Congress will solve the deficit or put Americans back to work."
 
1994 Deficit: $264 Billion
 Mr. Clinton's budget predicts a deficit of $322 billion for the current fiscal year. For the 1994 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, he proposes spending of $1.52 trillion and expects receipts of $1.25 trillion, for a deficit of $264 billion.
Tax collections and Government spending are acutely sensitive to changes in economic conditions. In formulating his budget, Mr. Clinton adopted the economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office, widely regarded by private economists as realistic. Democrats often charged that Mr. Reagan's economic assumptions were unduly optimistic.
In just seven weeks as budget officials recalculated Mr. Clinton's proposals, the budget blueprint has changed in ways that underline the difficulty of cutting the deficit:
*Five-year savings in Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, shrank to $46 billion, from the $63 billion assumed by the Clinton Administration in February.
*Revenue from increased taxation of Social Security benefits, originally put at $29 billion over five years, are now estimated at $23 billion.
*The projected total of budget deficits over the next five years has grown by $31 billion, to $1.2 trillion, since Mr. Clinton outlined his proposals in February.
Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, explained that with today's budget document, the President is "filling in the detail of proposals that were made in February, providing committees of Congress with more specific guidance."
 
Steps in Complex Process
 Mr. Clinton's budget is one step in a complex process by which Washington decides how to extract money from taxpayers and redistribute it for purposes it considers likely, in the words of the Constitution, to "promote the general welfare." The precise contours of Government spending and taxes depend on hundreds of decisions to be made by Congress over the next six months.
On March 31 and April 1, Congress approved a general plan, the budget resolution. To execute that plan, the committees of Congress -- 26 Appropriations subcommittees and 23 authorizing committees -- will make specific decisions, which may or may not conform to the President's wishes, depending in part on the effectiveness of White House lobbyists.
In his formal budget request today, Mr. Clinton refined some of his tax proposals, to make the energy tax more acceptable on Capitol Hill and to allow corporations to take tax deductions for executive pay over $1 million a year, provided the pay is tied to performance.
A panoramic view of Mr. Clinton's budget suggests that the Pentagon and farmers are among the big losers. Military spending, which began to decline under President Bush with the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, would decline 14 percent in the next five years, to $239 billion in 1998, from $277 billion this year.
Spending for agriculture would fall 42 percent, to $12.6 billion in 1998, from $21.9 billion this year. The Agriculture Department said that a return to more normal crop yields and weather would reduce the need for farm price supports and other Government subsidies.
By contrast, Mr. Clinton shows Medicare spending up 62 percent and Medicaid up 84 percent over the next five years. The cost of Medicare, $132.7 billion this year, would rise to $215.5 billion in 1998. The Federal share of Medicaid, the health program for low-income people, would rise to $148.3 billion in 1998, from $80.5 billion this year.
 
$296 Billion in New Revenue
 Over the five-year period covered by Mr. Clinton's budget, outlays for job training and employment programs would rise 41 percent, to $10.9 billion from the current $7.7 billion. Housing assistance would rise 39 percent, to $29.6 billion from $21.3 billion. Food stamps and other nutrition programs would grow 28 percent, to $45.4 billion from $35.4 billion.
The cost of the earned-income tax credit, for low-income workers with children, would more than double, to $22.9 billion in 1998, from the current $8.4 billion. Mr. Clinton and antipoverty groups say the tax credit is a way to reward work.
President Clinton said his tax proposals would generate additional revenue of $296 billion over the next five years. That figure does not include the $23 billion that he wants to raise by increasing the taxation of Social Security benefits for people with incomes above certain levels: $25,000 a year for individuals, $32,000 for couples.
The Administration classifies the Social Security proposal as a cut in spending rather than a tax increase. Either way, beneficiaries say, they lose money.
Even with Mr. Clinton's attempt at fiscal austerity, the White House acknowledges that the Federal debt, the accumulated total of all Federal borrowing, will continue its relentless rise, from $3 trillion last year to $4.6 trillion in 1998. (The numbers show debt held by the public and do not include Government securities held by Government trust funds.)
Representative John R. Kasich, ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, said: "While the Clinton budget will not be dead on arrival, there's no question that it's debt on arrival. It saddles Americans with $1.2 trillion in additional national debt over the next five years."
The Clinton budget drew a tepid reaction from environmental groups. Peter A. A. Berle, president of the National Audubon Society, called it "a mixed bag and, in some instances, a missed opportunity." He welcomed proposals for increased spending on waste water treatment, but said he was "very disappointed" with cuts in the land and water conservation fund, used to acquire land for future generations.
Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, praised the Administration for proposing a new tax on "wasteful and polluting energy use." But he said the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency suggested that it was "still suffering from the abuse it received during the 1980's."
All told, spending for natural resources and the environment would decline under Mr. Clinton's budget, to $20.8 billion next year, from $21.9 billion this year. It would rise slowly, to $21.6 billion in 1998, but would not keep pace with inflation.
In his campaign last year, Mr. Clinton said he would "expand efforts to acquire new park lands and recreational sites." But in the new budget, spending for conservation and land management would decline from $4.7 billion this year to $3.8 billion next year and $3.4 billion in 1998.
 
Transportation Spending
 As expected, Mr. Clinton asked Congress to repeal certain restrictions on the use of Federal money for abortions. Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, hailed the proposal, saying it would help poor women and Federal employees who depend on the Government to help finance their health care.
Mr. Clinton proposed major increases in Federal spending for mass transit, and much of the money would go to New York and New Jersey. Nationwide, the total would rise 37 percent, to $5.1 billion in 1998, from $3.7 billion this year.
Jack Gilstrap, executive vice president of the American Public Transit Association, said he was pleased with the proposal, "the biggest increase any Administration has offered in 13 years."
The deficits shown in Mr. Clinton's budget would be much bigger but for a growing surplus in the Social Security trust fund, which tends to mask the shortages in other parts of the budget. The Administration estimates that the trust fund surplus, $318.5 billion at the end of 1992, will reach $736 billion in 1998.
Mr. Clinton's budget would carry out his commitment to reduce the number of people working in the executive branch of the Government. The number of civilian employees, now 2.1 million, would decline by 102,000 in the next two years. Sixty percent of the reduction would occur in the Defense Department.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Acts to Sweeten Pot for Voters

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 8

 BODY:
Despite a new round of appeals and incentives from abroad to push for economic reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin is raising wages, increasing spending and issuing low-cost credits for bankrupt industries as part of a campaign to win a crucial referendum this month.
The steps being carried out by Mr. Yeltsin include linking interest on savings to inflation, raising benefits for the military and maintaining price controls -- all of which economists say swell the Government deficit and aggravate inflation. 
 Mr. Yeltsin's actions come as Russia is being pressed by the Clinton Administration and leaders of the other industrial nations to impose many painful austerity measures in order to get inflation under control by curbing Government subsidies and credits.
Inflation is now running at nearly 30 percent a month , which economists say has devastated Russia's chances for increased trade and investment.
 
Meeting in Tokyo
 The major industrial countries, known as the Group of Seven, plan to ease the terms for Moscow to repay $80 billion in debts and to offer another $30 billion in grants and loans at a meeting of foreign and finance ministers in Tokyo on April 14 and 15.
In Washington, Administration officials are also proposing that the International Monetary Fund and other creditors loosen some of their requirements for fiscal probity in Moscow, but only if the Russian Government shows good faith by carrying out some economic reforms.
Because much of the aid being proposed is contingent on seeing Russia carry out further reforms, Mr. Yeltsin's actions are raising questions about whether the new aid will ever be fully distributed.
In the last year, only a little more than half the $24 billion in aid that was promised ever found its way to Russia because of a failure to control inflation and rein in the money supply.
 
'I Really Am Very Skeptical'
 "I really am very skeptical," a Western envoy said. "I don't see what you can do with the money supply out of control. It all could take longer and be more painful than people realize."
Western officials nonetheless indicate that they seem to understand that Mr. Yeltsin must first renew his political mandate.
Mr. Yeltsin faces an important plebiscite on his presidency and his reforms on April 25, and aid from abroad is being organized and timed to help him then.
A senior Western diplomat said that unless Mr. Yeltsin can win handily, restoring his mandate and giving him new leverage over the legislature and the Central Bank, which the legislature controls, economic reform in Russia "will continue to go nowhere slowly."
 
Economics and Politics
 Boris G. Fyodorov, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Yeltsin ally who is the main proponent of economic reform, says, "Everything depends on April 25."
But the campaign for the referendum shows that in Russia no less than anywhere else, good economics are often bad politics. Even after President Clinton and others have proclaimed their support for reform in Russia, there remains deep skepticism about the kinds of medicine prescribed.
As defined by foreign creditors, for example, good economics mean much tighter money, less Government spending, better tax collection, higher interest rates, broader property rights, stricter interpretation of bankruptcy law and the readiness to accept significantly higher unemployment.
One critic of such steps, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, is instead promising new credits for the energy industry and for farmers as the spring sowing season starts. He is also criticizing the sale of Government-owned businesses to the private sector and talking of the need to preserve a large state sector and create price controls.
 
May Not Be Decisive
 Many foreign and Russian analysts also caution that April 25 may very well not be decisive, and that it may actually perpetuate the political and economic stalemate until elections can be held for president and legislature.
Referring to some of Mr. Yeltsin's deficit-swelling steps, Mr. Fyodorov said in an interview Wednesday with the newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta that the Government would simply have to find a way to finance these new political commitments.
"The budget as such is already all but nonexistent," he added, disclosing that the deficit this year was actually about $23 billion, based on revenues of about $14.9 billion.
He said it was essential to bring inflation down to less than 100 percent a year, from a current rate that is perhaps 40 times higher than that. "Otherwise everthing we do falls apart," he said. "It's impossible to fund anything and any planning or investment becomes absurd."
 
Attack on Central Bank
 Mr. Fyodorov also continued his strong attack on the Central Bank and its chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, who, he said, "displays astonishing ignorance." He cited a statement from Mr. Gerashchenko to the effect that with high inflation, the bank needed to issue even more rubles.
Foreign economists pushing for reforms also say that the Central Bank has not established a system in which money can be transferred easily among accounts in Russia. Many say they believe that the bank must eventually become answerable to the President of Russia, and not the legislature.
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr N. Shokhin, a Fyodorov ally, said everyone in the West "is turning to us at every corner to ask: 'Well, how is it? When will you come to terms with the Central Bank?' "
The prospects for a clear mandate for Mr. Yeltsin have also been clouded by confusion over the regulations governing the referendum. The Congress of People's Deputies, which dominated by Mr. Yeltsin's political foes, has ruled that Mr. Yeltsin must win the votes of half of all registered voters, an almost impossible task.
 
Taking Account of the Problems
 It is now expected that, no matter what the actual vote is, Mr. Yeltsin will claim a renewed popular mandate if he wins the majority of the votes cast. If the results are disappointing, his advisers suggest, he may resign to force new elections.
Foreign Governments seem to be trying hard to take account of the real political problems Mr. Yeltsin faces.
"You have to set them macroeconomic standards, but ones they can reach in the current political and financial situation," a Western envoy said.
In recent appearances and interviews, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has called for "corrections" in the reforms and sharply attacked the privatization program and its director, Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais. The Prime Minister added that many mistakes were being made in the crucial effort to turn state property over to private hands.
 
Compared to Collectivization
 In an especially inflammatory analogy, Mr. Chernomyrdin compared privatization to the Soviet collectivization of farmland -- implying the process was brutal, ideological and arbitrary.
Mr. Chubais, reacting angrily, said there could be no comparison to collectivization, under which "the Bolsheviks physically annihilated three million people" and sent another seven million to Siberia.
Mr. Chernomyrdin also said that destroying the Soviet planning and distribution ministries, Gosplan and Gossnab, was a mistake, and that they were still needed "in a slightly different form.
Mikhail Berger, the economics editor of Izvestia, said Mr. Chernomyrdin's recent remarks had badly shaken Mr. Fyodorov and other reformers.
"If you take half the economy away from the market and revise the basic principles of privatization, then what is left of the reforms?" he asked.

Economy
President Clinton sent Congress a $1.52 trillion budget that provides details of how he wants to reduce the deficit while spending more on public works, education and retraining jobless workers. But his detailed five-year spending and taxing plan takes no account of the overhaul of the health-care system. [Page A1.]
The Clinton Administration proposed that companies could continue to deduct seven-figure compensation packages as a business expense as long as they were tied to corporate financial performance and approved by shareholders. [D1.] 
 Producer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent in March, but the core inflation rate, which excludes figures for the erratic energy and food sectors, rose only one-tenth of 1 percent. The report calmed fears of resurgent inflation. [D1.]
Weak March sales were reported by almost all of the nation's large retail chains, which were hurt by bad weather and economic uncertainty. The drop continued a deceleration that began in January and is expected to continue. [D2.]
 
International
A Japanese company's purchase of the only American maker of some computer components used in the Patriot and Trident missiles contained key national security problems missed by the Federal Government when it approved the deal, according to a study by the Commerce Department. [D1.]
The Prime Minister in France's new conservative Government outlined an economic plan that affirmed the predominance of French links to German economic and monetary policy. [D2.]
The Japanese Government has begun a vigorous defense of a huge new spending package to stimulate the economy, even though details of the plan will not be announced for another week. [D4.]
Boris Yeltsin is raising Russian wages, increasing spending and helping bankrupt industries to win a crucial referendum. [A13.]

Westinghouse will sell most of the commercial property loans held by its financial services unit for about $1 billion to a partnership it formed with Lehman Brothers. [D3.]
United States Surgical stock plunged by a third after it said second-quarter results would be "very poor." It also said third-quarter results are expected to be flat. [D3.]

HEADLINE: Federal Judges Blame Money Woes for Slowdown

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
Facing what they say is a severe budget shortfall, most Federal judges around the nation have stopped scheduling new civil jury trials.
While there is disagreement about whether the postponements are prompted by brinkmanship or depleted budgets, there is no question that thousands of civil trials are being delayed. Most are commercial disputes, but the backlog also includes civil rights and copyright cases and other lawsuits filed under Federal law. 
 A recent memorandum to the district courts from a committee of the Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the courts, said that because of budget problems, no new civil jury trials could begin after May 12.
"The executive committee very much regrets that this extreme action is necessary, but I trust all of you understand the severe fiscal situation in which we find ourselves," L. Ralph Mecham, the director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, wrote in the memo.
 
Indigents' Trials Delayed
 Court administrators also say that the budget for many lawyers for indigent defendants in Federal criminal cases will run out as early as the end of this month. That will make it impossible for the trials to begin until Congress provides more money, which is not expected until September at the earliest.
About half of the 90,000 indigent defendants that pass through the Federal courts each year are represented by private lawyers appointed and paid by the court under the Criminal Justice Act. The other half are represented by Public Defender offices, which are not affected by the courts' budget problems. More than four of every five Federal defendants are poor enough to qualify for Government-paid lawyers.
By law, criminal defendants in Federal cases must generally be tried within 10 weeks after they have been charged. Cases delayed because the Government can not pay a lawyer might be dismissed.
Even if there is no money to pay indigents' lawyers, administrators say they are trying to save money to pay for juries in criminal trials by putting off civil trials.
The increase in criminal cases during the Reagan and Bush years has overloaded many Federal dockets and dramatically increased the interval between filings and trials in civil cases. Even before the latest budget problems, civil trials in many Federal jurisdictions had been delayed because of enormous increases in Federal narcotics cases.
This year, court administrators say, the problem for civil litigants worsened because Congress provided the judiciary with $130 million less than judges said they needed. The problem could be resolved if Congress were to give the judges more money or, according to some judges, if court administrators took funds from other judicial programs.
Privately, a handful of judges and Congressional aides say that there is some money left from other criminal programs to pay for jurors and defense lawyers until Congress can act in the fall, and that the judges are simply pushing for more money.
The judges have asked for another $92 million on top of the $2.46 billion already provided. Nearly $2 billion of the budget is for the salaries and expenses of staff and judges. The budget also includes $68.8 million to pay for jurors and $215.1 million for lawyers' services.
The jurors are paid $40 a day plus expenses, like food and parking, and hotel charges when they are sequestered. Administrators say that another $7.5 million should be enough to pay for criminal and civil jurors until the next fiscal year begins in October.
 
Not 'Crying Wolf'
 "There's no doubt in my mind that this is a ploy," said a Federal judge who insisted on not being identified."They could still save millions of dollars if they were less extravagant with a lot of their expenses."
But court administrators and many judges disagree. They also say they cannot shift money from one program to another without Congressional permission, and that they have already taken pains to reduce unnecessary expenses.
"Far from crying wolf, the courts have worked very hard to reduce the costs," said Federal Judge William W. Schwarzer, the director of the Federal Judicial Center.
Whatever the causes of the slowdown, litigants from around the nation have begun to feel the pinch. By postponing cases, the courts are effectively making them more difficult to settle, since many are not resolved until the eve of trial. That, in turn, could increase the backlog of cases.
A few of the cases being delayed have enormous ramifications. For instance, one patent case that was set to begin in Federal district court in New Bern, N.C. in June between two drug makers, Barr Laboratories and Burroughs-Wellcome, may have to be postponed. The outcome of the case will determine the price and availability of the drug AZT, which is used to treat AIDS patients.
 
'Appalling Problem'
 Judges from around the nation expressed frustration and anger at the budget problems, but have already begun notifying lawyers that they cannot schedule new trials.
"It's an appalling problem," said Federal District Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. in Manhattan. "What just makes me sick at heart is that we are simply not able to do the nation's business."
He added: "This is not choosing between one aspect of spending or another; this is saying one of the branches of Government is out of business. This is about litigants being disenfranchised."
A handful of other judges say they will ignore the notice and proceed anyway by offering the jurors i.o.u.'s to be redeemed when the money comes in.
"I will tell the jurors they'll have to wait to get paid," said Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein of District Court in Brooklyn. "I don't imagine that it will be a big problem."
Shortfalls in the Federal judiciary's budget have become a perennial problem, although this year seems to be the worst in a long time. Seven years ago, Federal courts postponed civil cases for two weeks.
Last year court administrators narrowly averted an empty budget for indigent criminal defendants by getting permission from Congress to shift money from other criminal justice programs. Congress then provided more money in September. But this year, with Congress working on President Clinton's economic package, administrators and lawmakers say it will probably be months before more money for the judiciary is approved.

Inflation News Heartens the Bond Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
After several weeks of nervousness and a heavy selloff in the bond market, traders and investors got some reassuring news on inflation yesterday and drove the yields on Treasury bonds and notes sharply lower.
Prices of bonds and notes spiked higher in the morning after the Labor Department reported that the core producer inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose just a tenth of 1 percent in March, well below the rate in February and January and below market expectations. 
The negligible increase in the core inflation rate allowed the market to ignore what probably would have been a very disturbing four-tenths of 1 percent increase in the overall Producer Price Index for finished goods.
Prices surged again later in the day when the the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, offered reassuring comments on inflation, saying that the economy was nearing price stability.
By the end of a shortened trading day ahead of the Good Friday holiday today, the price of the 30-year bond was up 110/32 , while its yield plunged to 6.85 percent, down from 6.95 on Wednesday.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note, another longer-term issue that is sensitive to inflation, was up 24/32 as its yield fell to 5.96 percent, from 6.06 percent the day before.
The selloff in the market since early March had been sparked by sharp jumps in the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price index in January and February and a surprisingly large jump in jobs over the first quarter of the year. The data did not portend a surge in inflation but indicated that if the pace continued, inflation would not decline below last year's level, which some forecasters and investors were betting on, and that it would likely be a little higher.
Given how far the bond market had rallied, that was enough of a reason to sell until the outlook was clearer.
But while yesterday's inflation report was positive, the course of the market from here is still uncertain. The Consumer Price Index for March will be released today, when the market is closed. If the consumer price increase is not in line with the small rise in producer prices, much of the market's good feeling of yesterday would be lost.
Traders said part of yesterday's bond market surge came from buyers who had previously sold Treasury securities short because they expected the core inflation rate to be higher. When their speculative bet proved wrong, they had to buy back the securities quickly to limit their losses. That added to the sharp rise in prices and the steep decline in yields, said Andrew S. Brenner, a trader at Nomura Securities International.
Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, said the report on March producer prices -- combined with the recent declines in the prices of commodities like lumber and copper -- provides a signal that inflation will decline this year.
Yesterday, Mr. Yardeni reaffirmed his forecast of a 2 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index, compared with 2.9 percent in 1992. He said such a small increase would mean that the yield on the 30-year bond should move toward 6.5 percent or lower, which is below the 16-year closing low of 6.72 percent reached on March 8.
But other analysts are not as sanguine. While the March producer price data provided a signal that inflation is not rising as fast as it was in the first two months of the year, they still forecast that prices will rise at the same or a slightly faster pace this year. And that means bond yields will remain around their current levels, but in a trading range that will preclude a breakthrough to new lows.
 
Yields Are Locked
 "I think people understand that inflation is not going to be horrible," said Nancy Kimelman, the chief economist for Technical Data in Boston. "But they understand that it is not going to be 2.5 percent either and that keeps us confined in a trading range."
Robert Giordano, the director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he expected data later in the year to show the inflation rate slowing to around last year's level. He said such data would send bond yields to new lows.
"But whether or not this is the start of that is another question," he added, saying that for now he believes that yields are locked in a trading range.
The bond market's rally yesterday was also aided by other data, including a small decline in initial jobless benefits claims and weak March store sales, which indicate that the economy is growing at a slower pace than at the nearly 5 percent clip at the end of last year. The slower growth means there is little chance that prices will be pushed higher by the demand of consumers or the exhausting of production capacity.

HEADLINE: Limited U.S. Force Held Still an Option in Bosnia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
As senior Administration officials prepared to meet on Friday to discuss American options in the face of the apparent collapse of peace talks in Bosnia, a senior Defense official insisted today that the use of limited force to stop Serbian attacks has not yet been ruled out.
In recent public remarks, President Clinton has backed away from his campaign position that air strikes could be used to curb Serb aggression. And the weight of opinion within the Clinton Administration appears to be to rely on economic sanctions to try to slow the fighting. 
 But, reflecting divisions within the Administration, the senior Defense official said it was possible Washington might yet decide to use force if it became clear that the talks could not be revived.
"I do not think we are giving up on it," the official said. "We are going to look at it."
The "principals committee," a body of top Administration officials dealing with national security matters, is scheduled to meet Friday to review the situation in Bosnia.
Among the issues the Clinton Administration has yet to resolve is when to declare the peace negotiations conducted by former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen dead and what to do if the talks cannot be restarted.
The meeting comes as there are divisions within the Clinton Administration over its Bosnia policy. Citing objections by the United States' European allies and Russia to the use of limited force, the State Department has dropped any talk of military action to quell the fighting and has instead stressed the need to tighten economic sanctions on Serbia.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has also said that Washington is consulting with its allies over exempting the Bosnian Government from the United Nations arms embargo, which has locked in the Serbian advantage. But Mr. Christopher has also gone out of his way to underscore that such a move could have serious drawbacks if the British and French responded by withdrawing the forces they have sent to Bosnia to guard aid convoys.
The American military, eager to avoid sliding into a quagmire, has argued that limited air strikes and arms shipments to the Bosnians would not be decisive.
But Defense Secretary Les Aspin continues to believe that air strikes should be considered and is sympathetic to the notion of lifting the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims, senior Administration officials have said in recent weeks.
In comments on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton appeared to side with the State Department by backing away from his campaign statements about using limited force. President Clinton stressed that the United States could not take any steps without the approval of its allies on the United Nations Security Council and suggested that the Serbs might be able to get their way if they could weather the economic embargo.
But Mr. Aspin has yet to press hard for using limited military force, officials say. And a senior Defense official said Mr. Clinton might yet opt for force.
"You have to ask yourself not what is going on now, but what it going to happen if it is clear that the Vance-Owen thing is not going to happen," the senior official said, asserting that the United States allies might drop their opposition to limited force if the killing continues.
The allied reluctance to use force also raises questions about the Clinton Administration's support of the peace negotiations.
Senior Defense officials have said in recent days that the Clinton Administration has been unable to muster sufficient support within the NATO alliance for dispatching a sizable peacekeeping force to Bosnia should the Clinton Administration succeed in persuading the Serbs to sign an accord.
The difficulties in using force appear to overshadow the West's willingness to enforce a no-flight zone over Bosnia. In Washington, the Pentagon said the United States had committed 12 Air Force jets and 12 Navy fighters from the aircraft carrier Roosevelt.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plan Adds Money For New York

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
The New York metropolitan region stands to benefit substantially from President Clinton's proposed increase in financing for mass-transit and social-welfare programs, according to analyses by state and city budget officials.
Mayor David N. Dinkins welcomed the budget proposal as a major change from the fiscal programs advanced by Republican administrations during the last 12 years, which eliminated many urban programs and reduced spending on others. 
 "For the first time in a dozen years, the proposals made by the President are good news for New York City and its residents," the Mayor said.
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, which requires approval by Congress, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut would receive nearly half of the $1.4 billion proposed for mass-transit capital assistance, a testament to the political clout of the three-state Congressional delegation. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, is chairman of the Finance Committee and sponsor of the legislation that authorized the financing, while Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, New Jersey Democrat, is chairman of the transportation subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.
 
'Good News for America'
 The mass-transit capital program would increase current spending by $640 million. Of that, New York would receive $318 million, New Jersey $226 million and Connecticut, $78 million. Under current law, New York receives $177 million, New Jersey, $207 million, and Connecticut, $57 million.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo called the budget "good news for America," while Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, another Democrat, said that "President Clinton's priorities match those of the people of New Jersey."
However, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, who was elected as an independent, declined to comment, leaving Terry L. Muilenburg, director of the state's office in Washington, to sound a cautious note. "Our preliminary analysis looks favorable," she said, "but we're reserving final judgment."
Under the proposal, New York City would receive $300 million in mass-transit capital funds, an increase of $30 million; Buffalo would receive $5.4 million, a rise of $4 million; Rochester would get $3.3 million, up $1.5 million, and Syracuse, $3 million, up $1.6 million.
But New York would suffer a slight decrease in mass-transit operating expenses, to $120 million from $121.4 million.
The three states would also benefit from a $3 billion national increase in spending on highway programs, to $18.3 billion. New York would receive an increase of $159 million, to $918 million; New Jersey would get an increase of $55 million, to $529 million, and Connecticut would receive an increase of $56 million, to $335 million.
The New York metropolitan region also stands to benefit from a $137 million increase in funds for Amtrak, to $633 million. The railroad serves the northeast corridor, among other routes. None of the funds have been earmarked for specific areas.
The area's low-income population would benefit from Mr. Clinton's proposed increases in many social-welfare programs. New York State would receive a $49 million increase in child-nutrition funds, to $595 million; a $97 million increase for Head Start programs, to $292 million, and smaller increases in special supplemental food programs for women, infants and children, as well as refugee assistance programs.
 
Praise From Dinkins
 Mayor Dinkins cited $400 million proposed nationwide for programs for undocumented aliens as "one of the most important new initiatives in the President's budget." He said the program "would be a great benefit not only to those workers in this city but also to the city health facilities, which are the safety net of our health-care system."
New York State would also benefit from a proposed $600 million nationwide increase in grants used to rebuild low-income neighborhoods. The state would receive a $78 million increase, to $208 million. But funds for housing rental subsidies to the elderly and disabled would decrease by $65 million, to $118 million, and rent subisidies for the poor would decrease $18 million, to $9 million.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, noting the austere aspects of the President's budget, said: "While we would like to do better, the Clinton Administration definitely has the city's priorities at heart. For a change, urban programs are not being arbitrarily cut."
Mayor Dinkins expressed disappointment that the budget failed to provide $70 million for construction of sewage-treatment plants in New York City. "I will make every effort to get this program resurrected as the budget process moves forward," the Mayor said.
 
Gain for Housing Authority
 But he was pleased that funds for public housing operating assistance would rise nationwide to $2.52 billion from $2.28 billion, providing the New York City Housing Authority with an increase of $38 million, to $402 million.
Lyle Dennis, director of New Jersey's office in Washington, compared President Clinton's budget favorably with that of former President George Bush, which would have eliminated the Economic Development Administration, abolished community services block grants and killed several other programs that have helped the state.
"On balance, the state of New Jersey is treated fairly by the proposals which President Clinton has made," Mr. Dennis said.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Defends Big Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 8

 BODY:
The Government has begun a vigorous defense of a huge new spending package to jump-start the economy and ease political pressure from Washington, even though details of the plan will not be announced for another week.
No figures have been disclosed, but it has been widely reported that the Government will announce from 12 trillion to 13 trillion yen in supplemental public works spending this year, or $105 billion to $115 billion. That follows a similar 10.7 trillion yen program begun last summer, which appears to have had little impact. 
 Critics of the plan say it has been shaped more by politics than economics and that the figures may have been massaged to make them seem larger. The real spending increases included in the budget, excluding sums that have no net impact on economic growth, are called ma mizu, or fresh water, by the Japanese.
Many Japanese and foreign economists contend that only a third to two-thirds of the new plan is ma mizu. Susumu Kato, the economist here with CS First Boston (Japan), said he expected only about 60 percent of the reported figure to represent a real increase. Jesper Koll, an economist here with S. G. Warburg Securities, put the figure at 40 percent because of what he said was double-counting and the use of Government money instead of private investment.
Finance Ministry officials, who called in foreign journalists today to discuss the matter, admitted that the previous stimulus plan was less than 100 percent ma mizu. But they insisted that there would be as much as 80 percent ma mizu in the new plan and that it would lift the economy to more than 3 percent growth this year from only about 1 percent growth in the fiscal year ended March 31.
Some officials warned that too much stimulus could ignite inflation, particularly in the property market.
"Of course, this kind of exercise is not a purely scientific exercise or a purely economic exercise," said one Finance Ministry official, who insisted that he not be identified. "It is a matter of politics as well."
The issue is important because the United States has urged Japan to stimulate its anemic economy to reduce its huge trade surplus, which hit a record $132.6 billion last year. A stronger domestic economy would mean that Japan would import more and that manufacturers would be able to sell more products at home rather than export them.
Next week, the finance and foreign ministers from the leading industrial nations, the so-called Group of Seven, will meet here, and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is said to be eager to offer the spending package as evidence of Japan's sincerity in reducing its surplus.
More important, Mr. Miyazawa is scheduled to leave for Washington late next week, where he will meet with President Clinton, who has harshly criticized Japan's trade imbalance. The economic stimulus plan is expected to be part of a huge new financial program that Mr. Miyazawa will bring to Washington as an omiyage, the traditional souvenir that a Japanese traveler brings as a gift to his host.

HEADLINE: Chicago's Mile of Retailing Magic

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 8

 BODY:
In an era when staying alive is a major feat for a downtown shopping district, North Michigan Avenue's "Magnificent Mile" of department stores and boutiques is a standout in that it has continued to live up to its name.
"I don't think there's another street like it in the country," said Robert Middlemas, general manager of Midwest operations for Nordstrom Inc., a high-end department store chain that has been unable, to its dismay, to find a store site on the broad stretch of the avenue north of the Chicago River. "It's a Mecca for shopping." 
 A recent survey by Northern Realty Group Ltd., a commercial real estate broker and consultant based here, showed retail vacancy rates in the corridor at 4.9 percent overall and 1 percent for street-level sites. The survey also found that rental rates, which have been falling sharply in many urban areas, have been stable on the avenue in the last year.
"Vacancy rate is a very good barometer," said Robert W. Buckner, president of Thompson Associates, a retail consulting firm in Ann Arbor, Mich. "Five percent or less is an incredible downtown vacancy rate."
Total sales at the approximately 420 stores along the avenue and in the neighboring Oak Street and North Pier areas increased at a modest clip right through the recession and topped $1 billion for the first time last year, according to figures compiled by the Greater North Michigan Avenue Association, whose members include hoteliers and office managers as well as store owners.
Such figures have local realtors and Chicago boosters crowing that the Magnificent Mile, which is not quite a mile long, is otherwise well-named. It is far healthier, they assert, than more famous urban shopping destinations like Fifth Avenue in New York and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif.
Still, a Michigan Avenue address is no guarantee of success. Page Jewelry, a chain with 22 jewelry stores in large malls around the Midwest, including 7 in the Chicago area, closed its store in Chicago Place, an eight-story vertical mall anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue in 1991. Bonwit Teller and I. Magnin both shut struggling department stores, and realtors say that both Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale's have been disappointed at various times with the performance of their stores. Gucci, which had a shop on two floors in the shopping center anchored by Bloomingdale's, gave up one of them to J. Crew.
Stores that appear to be faring better are nonetheless coy. "All I can say is it depends on what time of year and what product lines," said Jaqui Lividini, a spokesman in New York for Saks Fifth Avenue, when asked to characterize the performance of the Michigan Avenue store. She declined to compare it in any way with other large downtown Saks stores or the far larger New York flagship.
A key reason for Michigan Avenue's bustle is that the Chicago area and much of the rest of the Midwest escaped the brunt of the recent recession. But Michigan Avenue has other advantages for retailing.
The neighborhood includes a mixture of modern, high-rise office buildings and a large number of hotels catering to business travelers, conventioneers and tourists. It is also surrounded by the town houses and penthouse homes of some of Chicago's wealthiest residents. The parade of storefronts is broken by trees and the city's historic water tower, as well as three vertical shopping centers that feature 50 or more stores each and views of nearby Lake Michigan.
Its reputation for catering to wealthy shoppers dates back to the early decades of the century when it began attracting the carriage trade that had previously patronized the "Splendid Mile" of stores on State Street in Chicago's downtown Loop, located just to the south..
In addition, companies like the Sony Corporation, F.A.O. Schwarz, and Nike Inc. have recently opened high-energy stores on the avenue that are as much entertainment centers as sales outlets.
 
Nike's Own Basketball Court
 At Sony, visitors play with language translation devices, pads for sketching designs that appear on television screens, and other electronic novelties while viewing the company's wares. Nike Town's attractions include mementos of Michael Jordan, Bo Jackson and other athletes the company features in its advertising. Another feature is a basketball court where customers can take Nike shoes through their paces.
"This was No. 1 on the agenda," said Cindy Thurman, a recent Nike Town shopper who drove three and a half hours from Champaign, Ill., with her sons, ages 10 and 14, for "a couple of days of hitting some of the shops."
Not everyone is thrilled with the changes. To 80-year-old Stuart Brent, who has sold books on Michigan Avenue for 49 years and recalls long chats over coffee with writers like Gore Vidal in a long-gone cafe, the avenue is gripped in "spiritual boredom."
Specialty stores like Mr. Brent's book shop, just across the street from Nike and Sony, have long attracted out-of-towners searching for items that cannot be found in smaller retail centers. But the flashier newcomers have nevertheless broadened the street's appeal.
Surveys show that more than half of the spending on the street comes from people who live more than 50 miles away. At the F.A.O. Schwarz store, which opened in September, shoppers come regularly from Grosse Pointe and other wealthy suburbs of Detroit, from Minneapolis and from other cities in the Midwest. They have helped build sales volumes to a level second only to the 26-store chain's flagship New York store, according to Shannon Shaffer, the store manager.
"We knew it would be a home run," said Ms. Shaffer.
 
No Room for a Discounter
 One retailer that is having trouble going to bat on the street is the Filene's Basement Corporation, the clothing discounter. Filene's Basement tried to acquire I. Magnin's lease from R.H. Macy & Co. last year in a deal approved by the bankruptcy court but has been stymied by Prudential Insurance Company, the owner of the land. Prudential says that the lease strictly bars a discounter from using the site, a restriction it wrote in to protect property values. The dispute is in court, with the Greater North Michigan Avenue Association strongly backing Prudential.
Nordstrom's and other large retailers that would like big spaces on the avenue could be out of luck until the turn of the century or beyond. Developers say it would be far too risky to construct the 250,000 to 300,000 square feet of retail space a Nordstrom's would want because the only way to keep rents reasonable would be to develop a hotel, offices or luxury residences above the store.
The extra development would be a problem, because the market in these nonretail sectors is discouraging. The limited residential development near the downtown area is concentrated on relatively cheap abandoned industrial land just south of the city center, and both the hotel and office markets are glutted.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Urges Product-Liability Revisions

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 8

 BODY:
In an effort to protect manufacturers from exorbitant legal judgments, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today proposed significant changes in the state's laws on product liability that would make it harder for people who have been injured to establish fault and recover damages.
The Governor's proposal would also limit contingency fees that lawyers may charge in cases of product liability, as well as personal injury and wrongful death. 
 In proposing the legislation, Mr. Cuomo cited the burdens he said the state's liability laws had put on manufacturers. After a grinding recession and slow recovery, Mr. Cuomo has now sided with Republicans in the Senate who have long complained that the strict laws have overly burdened the state's businesses.
The most sweeping of the new laws would limit the time in which manufacturers can be sued to the "useful life" of a product and would give them the presumption of innocence if a product is made with the most advanced technology at the time.
 
'More Inviting' for Industries
 It would also block using as evidence the fact that manufacturers later improved a product's design. It would protect them from lawsuits based on inadequate warnings of products' possible dangers unless negligence can be proven.
"This measure," he said in a statement, "will make New York a more inviting place for manufacturers to locate."
While business groups hailed the legislation, public advocacy groups and lawyers denounced it as "anti-consumer," saying it would undo the state's reputation as a leader in protecting people from faulty products.
"This bill shifts responsibility away from manufacturers and onto consumers," said Blair Horner, executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. "It makes it even more difficult for consumers to receive damages when they are victimized."
 
Fierce Challenge Is Likely
 The Governor's proposal will almost certainly face a fierce challenge in the Legislature. A similar, although stronger bill has stalled in the Senate and Assembly for years. But if Mr. Cuomo's is seen as a compromise, it could stand a chance.
The state's product liability laws have gradually evolved in court cases over much of the century rather than in legislation. The Governor's proposal would for the first time create statutes specifying the circumstances in which manufacturers could be held liable for injury or death caused by their products.
Calling the system "inordinate the way it is now," Mr. Cuomo said his proposal would create a clearer and fairer one that would protect customers and manufacturers.
"The challenge before us is: How do you reduce the exposure of the business community without being unfair to the injured consumer?" he said in an interview. "I believe the changes we are proposing will deprive no single injured person of a fair opportunity to recover damages."
 
Shield for Most Stores
 In addition to the protections for manufacturers, the legislation would also shield from liability almost all stores that sell defective products made by other companies.
Two other changes would apply not only to product liability, but also to lawsuits in all personal injury or wrongful-death cases.
One would limit lawyers' fees by using a schedule created for medical malpractice cases in 1986. Under the schedule, lawyers could charge 30 percent if the award is less than $250,000 and incrementally less as the award rises, to 10 percent for awards more than $1.25 million.
Also, in cases with several defendants, successful plaintiffs would not be able to seek all damages from manufacturers found only partly liable -- the so-called "deep pockets" rule. Under the law now, a company assigned only some of the liability can be forced to pay the entire award simply because it has the money.
Daniel B. Walsh, the president of the Business Council of New York State, praised the legislation as "a significant step forward that will help improve our economy."
Others, though, sharply criticized the proposal as reversing a legacy of court protection for consumers.

HEADLINE: Investments For Industry

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
Low interest rates and high profits are prompting American businesses to increase their estimates of how much they will invest in buildings and new equipment this year.
Companies surveyed in the first quarter said they would spend $582 billion in 1993, up 6.6 percent from last year, and if realized, the biggest increase in four years, the Commerce Department said today. 
 A 1993 increase of 6.6 percent, if carried through, would be the largest since investment spending rose 11.4 percent in 1989. The estimate is an improvement over three months ago, when companies said they planned a 5.3 percent increase.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the survey was "encouraging and provides us with the hope that U.S. firms will contribute to economic growth this year."
But he noted with concern a planned 20.8 percent decline in investment by airlines, which would hurt an aerospace industry already reeling from cuts in military spending.
On Wednesday, stock prices of major airlines rose significantly in response to a spate of news items seen as indications of improving efficiency in what has been a largely unprofitable industry.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
After Cuomo's Court Withdrawal, Time to Work on a Legacy

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 8

 BODY:
This time there was no plane left waiting on the tarmac.
Unlike Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's last trip to the precipice, when he made preparations to fly to New Hampshire to file for the 1992 Presidential primary, there was no symbol of angst today about the Governor's decision to withdraw his name from consideration for the United States Supreme Court. 
 In fact, Mr. Cuomo's aides and friends said, the Governor showed a surprising ambivalence about the court from the very beginning. And he seemed uncommonly at peace today with his decision.
While his staff almost universally encouraged him to take the job if it was offered, Mr. Cuomo focused immediately on what he considered its shortcomings, his aides said.
 
'Hard to Accept'
 It was too confining. It was too passive. You could not speak your mind on radio and television. It was high on intellectual stimulation but low on instant gratification of either the ego or the soul.
"People find it hard to accept -- it's such an exalted position and all that -- but he just didn't want to be a judge," said Vincent Tese, the state's director of economic development and a Cuomo confidante. "It's not where his experience and talents lie."
Another Cuomo aide said: "Unlike the Presidency, everyone on the staff wanted him to do it. He just never got there."
Mr. Cuomo never got there at least in part because of a singular desire for political closure.
After a glorious first term, when he invigorated state government, shot to national stardom with a memorable speech and won re-election by a record margin, Mr. Cuomo's last six years have been increasingly difficult. His critics place part of the blame on the state's flagging economy and part on the Governor's style, which can be long on proposals and short on the grittier business of effecting change.
 
Strengthening His Grip
 Having endured hard times, Mr. Cuomo sees an opportunity for a fiscal revival for his state and a political rejuvenation for himself, his closest friends and aides said. He envisions a chance to create the legacy that has eluded him, to set a mark for endurance, to finish the way he started.
While other politicians instinctively reach for the next rung, Mr. Cuomo prefers to solidify his grip on the rung before him.
He once mused disdainfully that it was a distinctively American failing that politicians always strive for higher office rather than making a difference where they are. And even though it was his mother, an Italian immigrant named Immaculata, who asked him after his first gubernatorial election when he was going to become a judge, Mr. Cuomo has always had one foot in the old country and one in the new.
"There's a natural assumption that this is such a grand and important position that everything should fall before it," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. "But that's a judgment individuals have to make and I made mine and that's it."
 
Even Young Children
 The reason, of course, that people find it hard to accept that Mr. Cuomo did not want to sit on the Supreme Court is that he seems so intellectually and temperamentally suited to the job. He remains fascinated by the law and thrives on spirited debate and the dissection of belief.
As he explained in a radio interview this week, Mr. Cuomo regularly even challenges young children about the foundations of their world.
"I'll say, 'How old are you?' and they'll say, 'Nine.' " he began. "And then to just give a small, and I hope inoffensive, presentation of the Talmudic process, I say, 'How do you know?' "
"They say, 'Because I'm 9.' "
"Well how do you know?"
" 'Well, because my mother told me.' "
"Well, do you believe everything your mother told you? Maybe you're 17, and she doesn't want you to know because she doesn't want you to drive yet. Did you believe her when she told you there was a Santa Claus?"
Is it farfetched to think that, with Mr. Cuomo on the Court, a debate over Roe v. Wade would have begun with the question, "Justice Scalia, what color is your robe?"
 
Another New York No
 Mr. Cuomo, by the way, is not the only New Yorker who does not want to be considered by President Clinton for the Supreme Court.
Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye of the New York Court of Appeals, whom Mr. Cuomo promoted for the job after withdrawing his own name, said today that she also preferred to stay in New York.
Mr. Cuomo has said in interviews over the last two days that he simply believes he can be of more service in New York than in Washington. He has been energized in recent months by a series of crises he has helped manage, ranging from the World Trade Center bombing to the bankruptcy of The New York Post.
And he clearly has been buoyed by the gradual improvement in the state's economy and the relative ease of putting together this year's state budget. While he said today that he does not expect New York's fiscal condition to improve to the level of the mid-1980's, he is hopeful that the days of heavy deficits are behind him. That would allow him to focus on the issues that one Cuomo aide characterized today as "legacy pieces:" health care, changes in the public schools and environmental protection.
 
Baloney and Garbage
 If Mr. Cuomo runs for, wins and completes a fourth four-year term, he would surpass the 14-year mark set by Nelson Rockefeller, a record second only to the 25 years served by New York's first Governor, George Clinton.
Some in Albany, including members of the Governor's staff, have questioned why anybody would want the job for that long. They have hypothesized that Mr. Cuomo must take some psychic pleasure in the petty disputes with the Legislature that occupy so much of his time.
"That's a lot of baloney, that's a lot of garbage," Mr. Cuomo said today. "You think I enjoy being in there for hours disagreeing with Marino and Weprin. What am I, perverted? I'd rather be reading a book or writing poetry.
"You can't enjoy it. A lot of it is unnecessary. The whole system stinks. You don't do it because it's fun. You do it because you feel you're making a contribution toward improving things."
Then Mr. Cuomo noted that it has been a season for comebacks in New York -- for the economy, for the trade center, for The Post, metaphors all perhaps for the political comeback he may envision for himself.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON BUDGET;
A Budget With a Chance

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
For years, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush sent Congress budgets that were, it was commonly said at the time, dead on arrival. Since no one expected the Democrats who controlled Congress to approve the proposals of the Republican Presidents, the budget documents were more election manifestoes than operational plans, dependent more on stirring words than on sound fiscal analysis.
By contrast, the detailed budget President Clinton submitted today is clearly alive and kicking. The President and the majority in Congress are not only from the same party but on the same wavelength. This budget serves the conventional purpose: It is a road map for the course the country will be traveling. 
 Cutting through the spare language and detailed accounts, what the budget shows, for better or worse, is that taxes will go up, the military will face deep cuts and spending will be increased for several Government programs that languished in the Republican years.
"This budget basically reflects the policies of a new Administration," said Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton's budget director, "trying to change the priorities for this country and set a new direction."
While political obstacles lie along the course, they stand to block only details of the Clinton budget, not the themes. Snags will doubtless continue to develop, like the current impasse in the Senate over the President's jobs and economic stimulus bill. But Congress has already voted to put into effect tax increases and spending cuts in the neighborhood of what Mr. Clinton wants.
Furthermore, the main elements of the Clinton budget are on a fast track in the Capitol. All the tax proposals and many of the biggest spending programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will be packaged in one bill under the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means panel , said his committee would begin drafting the legislation, called a reconciliation bill, the first week in May and would finish in no more than two weeks. The measure will then go to the full House, which plans to vote by the end of May.
The Senate panel, headed by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, has promised to finish its work and send the measure to the floor by the middle of June.
This legislation will be debated under procedures that guarantee quick action. In the House, amendments on the floor will be limited if not completely barred. In the Senate, the rules will prohibit a filibuster like the one by Republicans that has tied up the jobs bill.
Under Democratic control, the Senate and House are most likely to approve easily the proposals to raise the taxes of corporations and wealthy individuals and to expand significantly the earned-income tax credit, a measure that helps poor working families rise above the poverty level.
The biggest disputes in the reconciliation bill are likely to develop over two tax proposals that together would raise about $75 billion over the next five years, much of it borne by middle-income taxpayers.
 
Disputable Tax Proposals
 One, a new tax on nearly all fuels, would result in most families paying a few hundred dollars a year more than they do now for gasoline, electricity and consumer products and services.
The other would increase the income taxes some retirees pay on their Social Security benefits. It would affect less than a quarter of the nation's Social Security recipients -- single retirees with incomes above $25,000 and couples with incomes over $32,000. But a retired couple getting $50,000 a year from a combination of Social Security, private pensions and investment income -- hardly a family anyone would consider wealthy -- would pay more than $500 in additional income taxes.
Both Republicans and many Democrats will balk at these measures, but the best bet is that the legislation will be adopted. No one has come up with other tax proposals that raise the same amount of revenue and are more politically digestible.
"We simply have to do it," said Senator Moynihan. "It's a problem if you're a political speech writer. But if you've got to raise $272 billion you have to do it."
The figure Mr. Moynihan cited is the amount of deficit reduction that the budget resolution approved by Congress last week orders his Finance Committee to achieve over five years.
But even if Congress approves Mr. Clinton's budget more or less as he offered it, that does not guarantee it will meet his goal of reducing the Federal deficit from the current 5.2 percent of the nation's total production of goods and services to 2.8 percent in the 1997 fiscal year, the last of Mr. Clinton's term.
 
Tiny Shifts Mean a Lot
 First, unexpected expenditures could arise, ranging from wars to natural disasters.
Second, no one can be sure the proposed taxes would raise as much revenue as the Clinton Administration and Congressional authorities estimate. Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan and now president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, argues that wealthy taxpayers will rearrange their finances to cut their tax bills and that as a consequence, the total receipts by the Government will be much lower than the budget projects.
Finally, forecasts of economic growth, inflation and interest rates are highly speculative. Unlike the Republicans, who often based their budgets on optimistic forecasts, the Clinton Administration is using forecasts that are decidedly more pessimistic than even those favored by their own economists.
Yet if the projections are off by only a small amount, the deficit down the road could change significantly. For example, if the economy grows by one percentage point less each year than the estimates being used, the deficit in the 1997 fiscal year, expected to be just under $200 billion, would be nearly $100 billion larger. If inflation runs one point higher, the deficit would be nearly $50 billion larger.

Investors Flee Metals After Aloca Report

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Investors battered aluminum stocks yesterday, and analysts said the issues were likely to remain under pressure until huge inventories of the metal have been pared.
The selling was prompted by an unexpectedly poor first-quarter-earnings report from the Aluminum Company of America, the nation's largest aluminum producer. Late Wednesday Alcoa said its first-quarter earnings fell by 50 percent from year-earlier levels, citing the aluminum glut and record-low prices for aluminum ingot. 
 Alcoa's news, which came after the stock market closed on Wednesday, was dealt with harshly yesterday. The stock fell by $2 a share in heavy trading, to a new 52-week low of $60.375 a share.
Reynolds Metals, which is expected to announce its earnings next week, fell by $1.25, to $44.25, also a new 52-week low. And prices of other metals companies declined slightly.
Since most aluminum makers are expected to post first-quarter losses, Alcoa's poor earnings report was a sobering reminder that even strong performers are finding it difficult to buck fundamental trends that plague the entire industry.
Overproduction, which has pushed prices to about 51 cents a pound, their lowest level in nearly a decade, is only one of the problems, analysts said.
 
Fighting Softening Demand
 The metals business is also fighting softening demand in Europe and Japan, which last year consumed an estimated 48 percent of all aluminum used in the industrialized West. The on-going depression in the former Soviet Union, traditionally a big consumer, and weakness in Eastern European economies, have not helped either.
Despite these weak spots, analysts said that basic, underlying demand for the metal remains good. The supply problem is what bedevils the industry. "Aluminum consumption has gone up every year for the last eleven years, to a new record each time," said Daniel Roling, a non-ferrous metals analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "There is not a demand problem."
At an estimated 5.1 million metric tons, "the inventory overhang is so overwhelming that we will be living with low metal prices and low aluminum prices for quite some time," said Thomas Van Leeuwen, senior metals analyst at Lehman Brothers. The industry has not yet cut back sufficiently to bring supply down. It is difficult to imagine that any rapid recovery will occur anytime soon over the next year to 18 months."
Despite poor fundamentals, many analysts said they are advising clients to hang on to aluminum stocks. "We have holds on most of the stocks, and are a bit more optimistic about Reynolds," said Charles Bradford, an industry analyst at UBS Securities. "At the bottom of the last recession in the early 1980s, the industry was operating at 70 percent of capacity. This time it is operating in the 90s. That means when the turn in prices comes it could be more violent on the upside."

HEADLINE: Security Issue Overlooked In Computer Concern's Sale

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
A review by the Commerce Department has found that the Federal Government missed key national security problems when it allowed a Japanese company to buy the only American manufacturer of some computer components used in the Patriot and Trident missiles.
The transaction, involving a unit of the Applied Magnetics Corporation of Goleta, Calif., was approved by the Bush Administration in January. The sale was the first foreign investment issue taken up by the Clinton Administration, which theoretically could still cancel it. 
 Foreign embassies and many American and foreign corporations have followed the case as a bellwether of the new Administration's attitudes toward the sale of companies with militarily strategic technologies. Federal law requires extensive review of such sales, but the Bush Administration routinely approved the deals at the end of the reviews.
The Defense Department has tried to avoid depending on Japanese companies for key military equipment, partly to avoid the risk of losing supplies in any political confrontation and partly because the employees of American defense companies vote in this country while Japanese defense company workers do not.
After being told today of the Commerce Department's findings, Senator J. James Exon, the Nebraska Democrat who wrote the nation's foreign investment review laws, said, "The transaction never should have been approved." Senator Exon criticized the Bush Administration's original decision after it was revealed in news reports on Jan. 25.
The Commerce Department's findings, contained in a confidential memo to the Treasury Department, come at an awkward time. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan is to arrive here next week for his first meeting with President Clinton. The Administration is trying to balance its concern about Japan's trade surplus with the need for Japanese participation in aid to the former Soviet Union.
According to the memo, the interagency committee that approved the sale on Jan. 19 was unaware that the Applied Magnetics unit was the only American company producing parts for sophisticated computer laser-disk drives. The eight-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States was also unaware of the extent to which the Navy's Trident missiles and the Army's Patriot missiles depend on these components, the memo said.
A Treasury Department official said tonight that the details of the Commerce Department memo were being actively investigated by the Treasury and Defense Departments. An American official who insisted on anonymity said that some of the information in the memo was not new, but the official declined to be more specific.
A copy of the memo was mailed to The New York Times in an envelope with no return address. Federal officials confirmed the authenticity of the document.
 
Degree of Misrepresentation
 Federal law allows the Treasury to reopen the case and cancel the sale if it determines that there were "material" misrepresentations made by the participants. The memo avoids any characterization of whether any misrepresentation was material. The memo said that if information provided by Applied Magnetics was intended to indicate that there were alternate sources among American companies for the components, "then that was possibly a misrepresentation."
William R. Anderson, the chief executive of Applied Magnetics, denied in a telephone interview today that any misrepresentations had been made. "You could make that point on the basis that our OMA's were designed for specific applications," he said. "That's really splitting hairs." The component in question is known as an OPD OMA subassembly.
Mr. Anderson said that other companies, mainly in Japan, were producing similar products, and that any national security concerns about the deal were unfounded.
 
Promises No Disruption
 The memo said that an Army program to improve the reliability of the Patriot missile, which was used to shoot down Iraqi Scud missiles in the Persian Gulf war, could be delayed by a year or two if the supply of the components is interrupted for any reason, the memo added. But Kim Frank, a spokeswoman for the American operations of the Tokyo-based Nakamichi Corporation, the company that bought the American concern, said today that the supply will not be interrupted and production will remain in the United States.
Laser-disk drives are like the compact disk players that many Americans have in their homes. A tiny laser is used in both to read the disk as it spins, much like a stylus in a phonograph.
But while a compact disk player might break if it falls off a bookcase, laser-disk drives for missiles are built to withstand the tremendous acceleration of a rocket launching, along with all the bumps and jostling that may be required to deploy a missile.
Most laser-disk drives move the entire laser around the disk. Applied Magnetics developed a technique in which the laser is mounted at the edge of the disk and shines a beam into a tiny lens that moves back and forth quickly across the disk and reflects the beam downward, reading the information.
Mr. Anderson said that his company's technology compensated for the acceleration of the lens and for the acceleration of the missile at the same time. But he said that a few Japanese companies had also developed similar technologies recently using stationary lasers.
 
Faced Deadline
 Shortly after President Clinton took office, the White House's National Economic Council and the Treasury Department began an immediate review of the last-minute decision by the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration was forced to make a decision on Jan. 19 because of a rule setting time limits for Government deliberations on such cases.
According to the Commerce Department memo, Applied Magnetics told the review committee on Jan. 14 that the Eastman Kodak Company, Honeywell Inc. and I.B.M. all made similar laser-disk drive components. But when the department later contacted these companies, it found that Kodak and Honeywell made components that were incompatible with current military hardware, while International Business Machines makes a similar but not interchangeable component in Japan, the memo said.
Ronald C. Roberts, a spokesman for Kodak, said that the memo was accurate. Kodak's technology is incompatible with Applied Magnetics' equipment and cannot be adapted to it, he said.
Honeywell and I.B.M. had no immediate information.

HEADLINE: Weather and Tax Fears Stall March Retail Sales

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Cold, wet weather and the prospect of higher taxes put the brakes on retail sales in March.
And although the sun has finally decided to make more than a passing appearance, retailers say less ephemeral issues like job instability, taxes and consumers' doubts about their future prosperity will continue to inhibit sales. 
 "There's no question the weather had an impact on the whole country last month," said Stephen A. Watson, the president of the Dayton Hudson Corporation. "But business would not be this difficult if there were not underlying issues out there. We're not out of the woods yet."
Almost all of the nation's large store chains reported weak March sales yesterday, continuing the deceleration that began in January. The Salomon Brothers Same-Store Sales Growth Index, which tracks the sales of 22 major retail chains, increased only 1 percent. A similar index compiled by Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. rose just nine-tenths of a percent.
Dayton Hudson, which operates Target stores, Mervyn's and several department store chains, reported a 3.9 percent increase in comparable-store sales over the five weeks that ended on April 3. Comparable-store sales are the sales in stores that are open at least a year, which analysts consider a better indicator than total sales because new stores typically have erratic sales patterns.
 
Apparel Sales Decline
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., had a 3 percent increase in same-store sales in March, far below its usual double-digit growth pattern. The May Department Stores Company, which operates several regional department store chains like Foley's and Famous Barr, posted a 5 percent gain in same-store sales. But analysts noted that last year the company had a 4.7 percent decline in same-store store sales in March, inflating the comparison.
Apparel retailers had difficulties. The Gap Inc. reported a 6 percent decline in same-store sales, and The Limited Inc.'s comparable-store sales slipped 3 percent.
"In the fourth quarter, we saw a return to the mall, which came about with the post-election enthusiasm and was clearly credit-driven," said Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst at the First Manhattan Company. "Since then, shoppers have received their credit card bills and a lot less of a tax refund than they got last year."
Retailers cautioned against reading too much into one week's worth of sales. Mr. Watson of Dayton Hudson attributed some of the acceleration to the fact that Easter is earlier this year than last. Spending usually picks up two or three weeks before the holiday.
"The outlook is for a slow spending environment, maybe 1 to 2 percent growth in real spending adjusted for inflation," said Robert F. Buchanan, a retail analyst at Alex. Brown.
 
Some Analysts Optimistic
 Mr. Buchanan and other analysts said they expect retailers to become more promotional in April, since the slow sales rate had inflated inventories. Retailers like Lord & Taylor and Macy's have already started sales, which they usually hold after Easter.
"They've taken early markdowns trying to clear the shelves," said Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associates Inc., a retail consulting company. "Retailers are very conscious of being lean and mean."
That does not bode well for first-quarter profits, however, since price-off sales cut into margins. Still, some analysts seemed optimistic about retailers' prospects for the next six months. They said warmer weather and the emergence of clearer fashion trends like bell-bottom pants, platform shoes and peasant blouses would help sales for apparel retailers like the Ann Taylor Stores Corporation, which closed 90 of its 218 stores for at least one day over a recent snowy weekend.
"Better weather and a better apparel offering in April should lead to improvements, although it's not going to make up for what they've already lost in the first quarter, said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Following are the details of major retailers' sales for March compared with sales for March last year:
 
Dayton Hudson Corp.
For five weeks ended on April 3: Same-store sales rose 3.9 percent. Overall sales totaled $1.61 billion, up 11.2 percent from $1.45 billion.

J.C. Penney Co. Inc.
For five weeks ended on April 3: Same-store sales rose 2.2 percent at Penney stores only. Overall sales totaled $1.56 billion, up 2 percent from $1.53 billion. (Overall sales include J.C. Penney, drug stores and catalog.)

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rose 0.4% in March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
In a report that calmed fears of resurgent inflation, prices received by American producers rose four-tenths of 1 percent in March, but scarcely at all when figures for the erratic energy and food sectors are removed.
So-called core inflation edged up just a tenth of 1 percent, according to the Labor Department, the best performance since December. 
 "Today's producer price figures throw cold water at the notion that inflation is roaring back in the midst of a tepid economic expansion," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade group representing businesses that buy from producers.
Separate reports today showed a modest 9,000 decline in claims for first-time jobless benefits last week and a 6.6 percent advance, to $582.3 billion, in projected 1993 corporate spending for new plant and equipment.
 
 
Interest Rates
 The reassuring inflation report followed two months of somewhat unsettling figures at both the wholesale and retail levels, which had led to what many viewed as negative developments. These included a rise in interest rates that could damage an uneven economic expansion already marked by meager job growth.
But today's report -- the department is to publish the Consumer Price Index for March on Friday -- was widely seen as a return to the subdued inflation levels of most of 1992 after aberrational increases in the first two months of this year. Overall inflation last year, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.9 percent. Most expectations for consumer inflation in 1993 remain in the range of 3 to 3.4 percent.
Donald E. Maude, bond strategist at Scotia McLeod, said he found "all aspects" of the P.P.I. report "highly encouraging for the inflation outlook." He cited, among others, the unsustainability of a 1.3 percent burst in energy prices resulting mainly from the mid-month blizzard and continued moderation in prices at earlier stages of production.
Intermediate goods prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month while crude goods rose four-tenths of 1 percent. They rose two-tenths and three-tenths of 1 percent, respectively, when energy was excluded.
Finished goods, like summer dresses, are those that are ready for sale to the final business or individual user. A bolt of cloth would be the comparable intermediate product; raw cotton would be the comparable crude product.
Other analysts noted that some key industrial commodities had been slumping severely recently, with copper futures tumbling to a five-year low and prices of aluminum dragged down by sluggish demand amid abundant supplies. Tobacco prices, which have buoyed the indexes for a year or more, have turned soft as reflected in this week's announcement by Philip Morris of a big cut for Marlboro cigarettes.
 
 
Some Skeptics
 Some analysts, however, remained skeptical. Michael P. Daly, an economist for the Cigna Corporation, the Hartford-based insurer, said it might be "inappropriate" to exclude energy since oil demand had firmed. Mr. Daly, who characterized his view as a minority one, said he was a bit surprised that the bond market rallied so strongly today after the report was released.
The four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the P.P.I. for finished goods was the second consecutive one of this size, advances not matched since the report for May 1992 that was subsequently revised downward.
Energy prices jumped 1.3 percent in March, midway between the January and February increases, with heating oil soaring 8.5 percent. Consumer foods rose five-tenths of 1 percent following a slight February decline as red meats, eggs, soft drinks, cheese and dry milk products rose, and the index for fish was raised substantially by a correction of earlier figures.
Prices of tobacco products, passenger cars, light trucks and household appliances advanced less than in February, while prices turned down for sanitary papers and health products, over-the-counter drugs and periodicals. Capital equipment rose two-tenths of 1 percent, about the same as in most other recent months, the department said.
 
 
Materials for Durable Goods
 Among intermediate goods, prices for materials for making durable goods rose two-tenths of 1 percent, far less than in February, as copper and brass mill shapes dropped 5.6 percent, hot rolled steel sheet and strip also turned down and the drop in primary copper accelerated. Hardwood lumber and plywood, subject to tight supply due partly to environmental disputes in the Northwest, gained less than in February.
Materials for nondurable manufacturing rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month as increases for paperboard, alkalies, chlorine, synthetic fibers and paint materials turned up, while basic organic chemicals turned down.
Construction goods rose 1.2 percent, a bit more than in February, on higher prices for millwork, plastic products, plumbing fixtures and brass fittings and gypsum products. The first-quarter increase for construction materials was at an annual rate of 13.8 percent, the biggest quarterly leap in 13 years.
The March upturn in crude goods mainly reflected higher costs of energy -- up eight-tenths of 1 percent following a 2.5 percent February decline -- as basic industrial materials rose much less than in February, while foods and feeds edged up slightly. Natural gas eased another 1.5 percent, following a February drop of almost 13 percent.
For the quarter, finished goods rose at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in contrast to a slight decline during the final three months of last year, the report also showed.

HEADLINE: Stocks Little Changed Despite Positive Data

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In the last day of a trading week shortened by Good Friday, the stock market lurched downward for most of the session yesterday but ended with overall prices barely changed. Good news from the Government on inflation did not seem to command many traders' attention.
There were some forceful exceptions. Alcoa dropped 2 points, to 60 3/8, after its announcement Wednesday -- made after the markets closed -- that first-quarter earnings fell 50 percent. 
 And U. S. Surgical plummeted another 15 1/4, to 31 3/8, after the company said, also late Wednesday, that it expected poor second-quarter results. The medical-instrument maker, whose stock had been falling for months, was the most actively traded stock on the Big Board at 8.44 million shares.
 
 
Searching for Stocks
 Otherwise, some investors, their wallets fattened by cash from the sell-off of consumer-product and retailing stocks earlier in the week, seemed to be searching for stocks to buy, accounting for the many share prices that traded in a narrow range.
Airline stocks like AMR, parent of American Airlines, proved to be one-day wonders. The stocks vaulted Wednesday on a variety of positive news, but drifted to earth yesterday in light trading in the absence of more cheering developments.
"There is plenty of confusion in the marketplace," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago. "The only thing stopping the market from falling is the excess cash that is all dressed up and looking for some place to go."
Mr. Chalasani said, for example, that when oil stock prices rise, airline and auto stocks usually fall because high petroleum prices raise the operating costs of planes and cars. But all three groups of stocks have generally risen recently, partly because of investors looking for good stocks to buy, he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.54 point, to 3,396.48. For the last five sessions, the Dow has pulsed between about 3,320 and 3,420. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index was down 0.48 point, to 243.84. The Standard & Poor's 500 was down 0.89 point, to 441.84. The Nasdaq composite index declined 2.55 points, to 666.33.
But like Wednesday's trading, advancing stocks led decliners by about 10 to 9. A total of 284.7 million shares were traded, lower than earlier sessions in the week.
 
 
Producer Prices
 The Labor Department reported an hour before the Big Board's opening bell at 9:30 A.M. that producer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts were impressed, however, that "core" inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose a lower-than-expected one-tenth of 1 percent.
Although the bond market rallied at the news, because low inflation makes existing bonds more valuable, the stock market slumped a little in the morning, then dropped more than 12 points in the early afternoon.
The selloff of consumer and retailing stocks leveled off, but trading of these issues was still at volumes that landed the companies on the Big Board's most-active list. Philip Morris was the second-most-active stock, closing down 1 point, to 46 1/4. Philip Morris's volume was 8.25 million shares, up from 7.5 million shares Wednesday but below Tuesday's 10.2 million shares.
Wal-Mart Stores closed up 1 1/8, to 28 7/8, on volume of 7.55 million shares, lower than Wednesday's 11.4 million shares and about half of Tuesday's 14.6 million shares.
Coca-Cola was up 1/4, to 39 3/4, on volume of 5.42 million shares, up from Wednesday's 3.6 million and Tuesday's 4 million.

HEADLINE: Stone Container Holds Off On Stock and Debt Offering

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The Stone Container Corporation, its stock pummeled since it disclosed plans last week to raise $500 million by selling stock, said yesterday that it would postpone any attempt to raise capital.
Roger Stone, chairman of the pulp and paper company, said investors had misunderstood the company's financial condition. 
 "It was perceived we had liquidity problems, that the banks were imposing a solution on us," Mr. Stone said. "That was wrong."
Mr. Stone said the company decided late last year to raise capital to reduce its high level of debt and had presented that plan to its banks. He said the deadline of May 31 in Stone's credit amendments, which was disclosed in the company's annual report last week, was not really an important date.
 
Loss Forecast
 Mr. Stone added that the company would report a loss for the first quarter but added that the loss would be well within expectations, which he said were for a range of 80 cents to $1.25 a share. That contrasts with a loss of 15 cents a share in the similar quarter a year ago.
Stone's stock fell to $6 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday -- amid speculation that the stock offering would not be made -- when it was halted for the announcement. It did not reopen, but there were two later trades, one at $6.50 on the Pacific Stock Exchange and one over-the-counter at $7.50, which became the closing price. That was down $1.25 for the day. Before the disclosure of the financing plans, the stock was trading for $12.50.
Mr. Stone said Bankers Trust, its lead bank, was supportive and said he was highly confident that the banks would approve necessary amendments to its credit agreement to enable it to defer raising more capital until a more opportune moment.
Stone went deeply into debt in the 1980's as it embarked on an acquisition binge, leaving it vulnerable to the recent recession, which is still affecting many of its markets. Mr. Stone said that when the company was planning the possible stock offering, its shares were trading in a range of $15 to $19. At current prices, he said, the offering did not make sense. He said that a related $300 million debt offering, also disclosed in the annual report, had also been postponed.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Bit of Hartford's Past Yields to Change and Chains

BYLINE: By Kirk Johnson

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
FOR 158 years, through the days of whale oil lamps and the brief flowering of a local literary culture around such luminaries as Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe, Huntington's Book Store knew Hartford well enough to survive just about anything.
Like Hartford, it was a little stuffy, perhaps, and unquestionably highbrow, but in a town of insurance actuaries and banking burghers, it was the right stuffy: the same endearing rectitude and seriousness, leavened at surprising times by a streak of prickly, assertive, even oddball independence of mind. 
 And now it, too, will slip away into memory, a victim of recession, high-volume chain bookstores and suburbanites who won't go downtown anymore. The store, which has done business under eight different names and at least as many owners since it opened in 1835 as Packard & Brown booksellers, will close next month.
One can still take the pulse of Hartford from the books sold here. Nonfiction sells better than fiction, literary fiction sells better than commercial fiction, and where commerce is dominated by corporate mainframes, books about I.B.M. computers sell better than books about the more freewheeling Macintosh.
Pulp romance and science fiction? Thank you, no. They molder on the shelves. Sidney Sheldon and Danielle Steele? "The cusp of literature," sniffs the owner, David Epstein.
But this is no hoary museum of unread Henry Adams novels and fixed-income annuity journals. This was the store that displayed, almost exuberantly in its windows, Salman Rushdie's novel "Satanic Verses" a few years ago, if only to make a point. In the 1960's, the former owner, Trumbull Huntington, was arrested on indecency charges for a similar exuberance in selling Henry Miller's "Tropic of Cancer." (He was cleared, and Mr. Epstein keeps the court transcript in the back, for inspiration.)
Harriet Beecher Stowe, according to store legend, used to come here and sit in dignified repose, insisting that she be waited upon. Mark Twain, by contrast, reputedly held a more raucous court in the back room. One imagines his thick cigar smoke and his wet whisky glass rings staining the high-minded tomes in gleeful spite of their pomposities.
There are two spots in Huntington's that should be recorded for posterity. One is the far corner on the right side as you enter. That is where a clerk, Vinny Fuerst, plays his viola every morning for two and a half hours before the store opens. Facing the language and travel books, eyes closed, his mournful midrange notes filling the store, he seems transported to some faraway place. His music, whether Mozart or Mendelssohn, sets the tone: However crazed a day may be outside, a calm sense of sophistication and friendly intelligence invariably reigns here.
The other spot is just behind the biography shelves, where a person could stand openly and blatantly reading magazines all through his lunch hour without the slightest intention of buying a one. That such a person could then look the clerk in the eye next time and not feel even the slightest trace of opprobrium says much about the level of tolerance and the pace.
If this were a bar, it would be the sort where you could nurse a single beer all night. They knew you'd develop a real thirst sooner or later, probably for some obscure, expensive book that they would gladly order for you. And if everybody doesn't quite know your name, well, then you haven't been there enough.
Is it a stab in the back to this troubled, stumbling city for Huntington's to close? Is this a betrayal of the sort that Hartford's last big department store, G. Fox, perpetrated last year after a 145-year history.
There is clearly a tension in the air, and in the way of any broken relationship, the unspoken questions are often the loudest. Mr. Epstein said some customers have burst into tears. "How can you can do this us?" they ask.
And sometimes Mr. Epstein wants to ask back: Where were you all these sad months when the store really needed you? Who betrayed whom?
"I've been playing to an empty house," he said.
Still one should not mourn the death of book buying in Hartford. Two chain bookstores have opened in the last year. An Encore Books is now only a half-block away, and Barnes & Noble opened a 60,000-volume superstore just over the city line in West Hartford, stocking almost twice as many books as Huntington's had before it began its liquidation sale.
Going to a chain bookstore, of course, is like going to McDonald's. The menu will be about the same, and you could be just about anywhere. Huntington's was a personality that grew on you, or it didn't.
"In Huntington's you would find a distinctive taste," said one former lunchtime browser, Scott Bushnell, who now lives in chain-store purgatory in Fort Wayne, Ind. "It's the only thing I really miss."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits New Low vs. Yen And Gold Slips in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar sank against most leading currencies yesterday, tumbling to another postwar low against the Japanese yen in a selloff tied to falling American interest rates.
Gold edged lower in New York after a mixed showing overseas. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell 80 cents, to $337.60 an ounce. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $337.00 an ounce, 75 cents lower than on Wednesday.
 
Favorable Price Data
 Dealers sold dollars after the bond market rallied in response to the Government's latest inflation report. The enthusiasm in the bond market drove the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.85 percent from 6.95 percent on Wednesday. 
Lower American interest rates reduce returns on dollar-denominated investments and tend to lower the demand for dollars.
Currency dealers detected a change in the mood of the bond market, where inflation fears were eased by the Labor Department report on producer prices for March. It showed prices charged by producers rose four-tenths of a percent in March. But excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices edged up just a tenth of a percent, the smallest increase in three months.
Trading in the dollar began in Tokyo on a weak note, and the currency finished the Tokyo session at 113.65 yen, down 0.37 yen from Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar fell to 113.40 yen. The selling continued in New York, where the dollar also ended at 113.40 yen, down from 113.50 late Wednesday. It was another postwar low for the dollar.
The dollar briefly dipped below 113 yen in New York, and several dealers said they suspected that central banks intervened to halt the slide. There was no confirmation of any central bank activity.
John McCarthy, chief dealer at ABN-Amro Bank in New York, said the selloff was exaggerated because it came as traders were adjusting their positions ahead of the Easter weekend.
The British pound rose to $1.5251 in London from $1.5150 late Wednesday. A pound fetched $1.5275 late in New York, compared with $1.5135 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.6065 German marks, down from 1.6190; 1.4785 Swiss francs, down from 1.4910; 5.4395 French francs, down from 5.4770; 1,573.50 Italian lire, down from 1,591.00, and 1.2571 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2631.

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:

Whither 12 Warhols?
Andy Warhol was an artist who liked to think in multiples. But what might he say if he knew that 12 of his works are being offered for sale at once at Sotheby's in New York on May 3?
Ten of the works are from the private collection of Fred W. Hughes, Warhol's business manager for 25 years and now the executor of the Warhol estate and chairman emeritus of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Mr. Hughes has amassed an extraordinary collection of Warhols from the early 1960's, which experts consider the cream of the crop for serious Pop Art collectors. Mr. Hughes said he was selling his Warhols because "I need the money." 
 The other two Warhol works in the sale are being offered by unidentified private collectors.
Sotheby's made the deal with Mr. Hughes quite recently and did not include the Warhol works on the international tour that usually precedes a sale of important Impressionist, modern or contemporary art. Nor has Sotheby's cited the Warhols in its advertising for the May 3 sale.
"The tour was arranged far in advance, and this was fairly late business-getting," said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, who heads the global division of Sotheby's department of contemporary art. The negotiations were not final until February, she added.
 
A Roller-Coaster Ride
 Some art-world experts think the auction is just too much of a good thing, and predicted that putting 12 top Warhols up for sale on the same night will flood the market and drive prices down. But others say they believe the sale will create an excitement that could give the market a boost.
Since Warhol's death in 1987, prices for his work have taken a roller-coaster ride. During the late 1980's, prices for Warhols, as for so much art on the market, shot up; in 1989, the record price for a Warhol was set when "Shot Red Marilyn," a 40-inch-square painting from 1964, sold for $4.03 million at Christie's in New York. By 1990, when the market took a downturn, Warhol's prices were taking a beating, too.
But over the last year, buyers have paid high prices for work they considered extraordinary. Last May, for example, "210 Coca-Cola Bottles," from 1962, sold for $2.09 million at Christie's in New York. In November, "Marilyn X 100," also from 1962, sold at Sotheby's in New York for $3.7 million. And in December, at Sotheby's in London, "Four Marilyns," from 1962, fetched almost double its pre-sale estimate, selling for $946,000.
"Warhol has always had universal appeal," said Ms. Mitchell-Innes. "And it's helped sustain the market."
 
'No Two Are Alike'
 Most of the works in next month's sale are from 1961 to 1963. The two being sold by private collectors are "The Tuna Fish Disaster," from 1963, which Sotheby's is estimating to bring $500,000 to $600,000, and "Self-Portrait (Green Camouflage)," from 1986, estimated to bring $400,000 to $500,000. Among the works from Mr. Hughes's collection are "Double Elvis," from 1963, estimated to bring between $700,000 and $900,000; "Old Telephone," from 1961 ($600,000 to $800,000); "Schlitz Cans," from 1961 ($500,000 to $700,000), and "A Boy for Meg," from 1961 ($600,000 to $800,000).
"Our objective was to price works conservatively, without being disrespectful to the market, so that everyone would want to come buy," said Ms. Mitchell-Innes. "No two images are alike, both in terms of subject and price range."
The 10 Warhols being sold by Mr. Hughes will have a catalogue of their own, and Mr. Hughes said he believed the market was right for the sale. The Manhattan art dealer Leo Castelli agrees. "There are still about a half a dozen collectors from the United States, Germany and France who are looking for serious Warhols," Mr. Castelli said. "I don't think this is a bad idea; it might create some healthy competition among buyers."
Other dealers were more skeptical, but none would talk negatively for attribution. Several contemporary-art dealers said they believed the market could not absorb so many Warhols at one time.
But one potential buyer is the Warhol Museum, which is to open in Pittsburgh next spring with an extraordinary collection it inherited from the artist's estate. Asked if there was any basis for such pessimistic speculation about the market for Warhols, the museum's director, Thomas Armstrong, would say only, "I decline to comment." Mr. Armstrong also declined to discuss whether the museum was interested in buying any of the Warhols in the sale.
 
Changes for Curators
 Last spring the news was about artists going gallery hopping; this season, it's museum curators who are on the move.
At the Museum of Modern Art, John Elderfield, who was the curator of the spectacular Matisse retrospective and has headed the Modern's drawing department for the last 13 years, has just been named chief curator at large. The new title is the first in a series of changes in the top curatorial titles.
"Chief curator is more descriptive than department director," said Richard E. Oldenburg, the museum's director. "The curators felt it is a better description of their true responsibilities." A search committee is being formed to look for a new head for the drawings department.
Saying he was delighted by his new appointment, Mr. Elderfield added, "I felt it was time for a change." In his new position, he will devote more time to writing catalogues, like the second volume on Matisse, and to organizing exhibitions, while assisting Mr. Oldenburg with shows and publications. "There is always a sense that with seniority comes more administrative work," said Mr. Elderfield.
Mr. Oldenburg was quick to point out that Mr. Elderfield's position is considered to be on the same level as the museum department heads, and that the change will not affect the duties that make up the museum president's job, a paid position for which candidates are being interviewed. "John can help me with the curatorial side of the museum without becoming involved in the day-to-day administrative process," he said. "The job of the president will be purely business and fund-raising."
 
Coast-to-Coast Moves
 In Washington, the National Gallery of Art made two major appointments this week. Mark Rosenthal, a freelance curator who has been a consultant at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, where he organized "Abstraction in the 20th Century," a show scheduled to open next year, will become the National Gallery's curator of 20th-century art. He replaces Jack Cowart, who left last fall to become chief curator and deputy director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington.
And Philip Conisbee, who is leaving the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where he headed the department of European painting and sculpture for the last five years, will become the National Gallery's curator of French paintings. He will once again be working with Earl A. Powell 3d, who was the director of the Los Angeles County Museum before becoming director of the National Gallery last fall.
"It's definitely an important step for me," said Mr. Conisbee. "I have been working on the gallery's catalogue of 17th- and 18th-century paintings, and it hasn't been easy being across the country."
The Los Angeles County Museum is now looking for a replacement, but "the difficult economic situation in Los Angeles has not been encouraging," Mr. Conisbee said.
Not encouraging, indeed. Just as Michael E. Shapiro replaced Mr. Powell as director of the Los Angeles County Museum, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors cut $2 million from the museum's operating budget. The museum is also facing a decline in membership funds and in donations. It has cut its staff drastically the last few months and is being sued by Maurice Tuchman, the senior curator for 20th-century drawings. Mr. Tuchman, who was the chief curator of 20th-century art for 27 years, alleges that he was unfairly demoted and is seeking damages and reinstatement to his former job.
Mr. Conisbee isn't the only curator to flee. Judi Freeman, a curator of 20th-century art at the Los Angeles County Museum, is leaving, too. She is becoming the Joan Whitney Payson senior curator at the Portland Museum of Art in Portland, Me. "It's a small museum where I will be given the opportunity to work on acquisitions and exhibition programs in both 19th- and 20th-century art, in all media," said Ms. Freeman. "I feel very strongly that more women at museums need to start taking the initiative in senior curatorial positions. I will be able to put a mark on this institution."
 
 
Growing Again
 As museums expanded in the 1970's and 80's, many began to resemble small campuses. One that continues to grow is the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston.
This month, ground-breaking takes place for the first phase of its ambitious master plan: a $7.5 million building designed by the Carlos Jimenez Architectural Design Studio in Houston. The three-story building is to house the museum's administrative offices and classrooms for the Junior School of the Glasell School of Art, the museum's teaching wing. "This will centralize all of our administration," said Peter C. Marzio, the museum's director. "Long-term, it means the museum building will remain entirely public."
This isn't the institution's first major expansion. In 1986, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi designed its Cullen Sculpture Garden. Two other additions, Cullinan Hall and the Brown Pavilion, completed in 1958 and 1974, respectively, were designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. And just a year ago, the museum announced plans for a $50 million complex to be built east of the museum's main building. The Spanish architect Rafael Moneo was selected to design the addition.
Mr. Marzio said that half the money for the latest addition has been raised, all of it from the private sector, and that he was confident of raising the rest privately, too.

HEADLINE: The President's Budget Priorities

 BODY:
The budget presented yesterday by the Clinton Administration contained no big surprises. The line-by-line details in its 1,300 pages mirrored the economic plan Mr. Clinton outlined in February. Still, the budget's release provides a good occasion to measure the progress and implications of President Clinton's assault on Reagan-Bush economics.
The basic numbers are familiar. Mr. Clinton proposes to cut the deficit over the next four years by about $450 billion, while increasing public investments in infrastructure, training and education by about $150 billion. Spending in Commerce, Justice and many other departments is barely touched. The big hits are few: cuts in spending on defense and agriculture, increases in energy taxes and income taxes on upper-income families. 
 Despite the cuts, annual deficits will remain large and over the next five years are expected to add more than $1 trillion to the national debt. Still, by 1997, the Clinton plan would bring the annual deficit down to about $200 billion -- a reasonable target. But it would rise steeply thereafter unless health care spending for Medicaid and Medicare are brought under control.
Although the broad aggregates show only modest gains, there is an important tale in the line-by-line particulars. Mr. Clinton proposes tilting spending away from the military and away from consumption, both public and private. It's an important turnaround for an economy that has seen its savings rate evaporate. A generation from now, Americans should enjoy better living standards.
A few numbers in next year's budget capture Mr. Clinton's priorities. Defense Department spending will fall by $10 billion, while spending by Health and Human Services will rise by almost $50 billion. The increases will go for early education for poor children, childhood immunization, women's health and drug abuse treatment.
Spending by the Labor Department will fall, but the remaining money will be targeted on job training and retraining -- especially for workers who lose their jobs because of military cuts and plant closings.
Congress has already approved Mr. Clinton's targets for overall spending, revenue and the deficit -- except for the short-term $16 billion stimulus package that is tied up in the Senate. But the approval settled virtually no specifics. It's the all-important details in the new budget that Congress will take up after Easter break.
America's economic future depends more on what the Government buys than on how much it borrows. Spending billions on unnecessary military bases, even if paid for with taxes, undermines growth; and borrowing to invest in 21st-century technology can propel growth. Priorities matter -- and that's where Mr. Clinton's plan sparkles.

HEADLINE: On Terming Proposed U.S. Attorneys a 'Woman and a Black'

 BODY:
To the Editors:
"Woman and a Black," a March 31 headline states, have been proposed as United States Attorneys in New York. By identifying Mary Jo White and Zachary W. Carter exclusively by race and gender, you perpetuate problems that you condemn in your editorials. Moreover, you reinforce the marginalization of both women and blacks, and indirectly help to marginalize black women doubly. 
 These were the thoughts that three virtual strangers discovered they held in common March 31. And the questions that arose during our conversation were these:
If race and gender are the key criteria in the nomination of these two people, as your headline suggests, are we to assume that all "women" are white and all "blacks" are men?
Are "blacks" somehow exempt from gender classification, and are "women" somehow exempt from distinction by race?
Could you ever dream of a headline that read "Male and a Jew Proposed as United States Attorneys in New York"? Or even, "A White and a Heterosexual"?
This is certainly an exciting time for women and minorities in this country. But as the Clinton Administration has repeatedly tried to stress, the point is not to put heretofore marginalized groups into office simply because they are so-called minorities, but rather to fill offices with people who have always been qualified to fill these positions and who, as a group, reflect the larger group that is the public. An Administration that looks like us has not been the case in any of our lifetimes.
The appointment of women and minorities is important to the betterment of our sociopolitical environment and is indeed newsworthy. But why not reflect that real progress is being made by rejecting categories that only reinforce marginalization?
As we three -- differing in age, occupation, economic status and sexual orientation -- immediately realized, headlines like this ultimately work against achievement of equality between races and genders. The labels you choose to give your subjects can help or hinder, accelerate or freeze progress in this area. Race and gender are closely allied categories, and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream applies here -- to judge one by the "content of one's character" -- to resist the tendency to label.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Here We Go Again

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Time after time in the past half-century the Western democracies strengthened dictatorships economically and militarily. Then of course the dictatorships made war against the democracies. Heaven help us, the West is at it again.
Before World War II, the West permitted Hitler to rearm. It handed him Czechoslovakia. Hitler and Mussolini were allowed to take Spain into the Fascist orbit. After World War II, Central and Eastern Europe were delivered hogtied to Stalin. 
 In Asia and the Pacific, the West absolutely knew Japan would be a threat only to Asians, nothing for the likes of us to worry about. After Tokyo surrendered, half of Korea, brutalized by Japan for decades, was turned over by the U.S. to the Red Army.
In the Middle East Iraq was armed by the West up to the invasion of Kuwait. During and since the gulf war, Iran moved to nuclear capacity while the West stood by -- that part of the West that was not selling Teheran some of the right stuff. And we told ourselves Mideast terrorism was a threat only to Middle Easterners.
And now -- now we press money and space equipment on Communist China. In 5 to 10 years, the surge of China will turn out to be either acceptable or terrifying. But that will depend on what happens beginning now -- whether the U.S. pushes for freedom within China, at sorrowfully long last.
Under a democratic government, China's growth would be no more fearful, and just as welcome, as growth in a democratic Russia.
The danger of rising power lies only in those countries where it is overseen, commanded and used by governments whose rulers can make war by fiat -- the dictatorships, whether Fascist, Communist, military, terrorist or theological.
The world adores all those stories about how the Chinese are each and every one making money hand over fist. But the Communist dictators of China still rule by police terror. The burgeoning Chinese Army still is totally controlled by the Communists. They can use it at their will, as all Asia never forgets.
During Bushbaker, the U.S. did nothing to slow the growth of Chinese Communist power by backing the freedom fighters -- not while Beijing jacked up its military budget every year, not while Beijing sold nuclear and missile hardware and technology to other dictatorships.
And meanwhile, in case anybody still cares, thousands of political prisoners are tied to boards, tortured and starved in Communist jails. Millions of Chinese sweated at slave labor in the prison camp -- a built-in part of Beijing's economic planning.
Congressional attempts to use economic pressure on Beijing were vetoed by the White House. Instead, Bushbaker sold Beijing space satellites and military jet engines, and something even more valuable: respectability.
Why, Communist China is so respectable that Olympic representatives traipse around Beijing from banquet to banquet. Beijing is the number one prospect for the Olympic games in 2000. That will be a real fine way to ring in the new century, with an Olympic site politically unmatched since Nazi Berlin in 1936.
Now it is Bill Clinton's chance. He can stop military sales to China's Communist lords. And, under legislation that Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco will again submit, he can cancel China's low tariff privileges unless by next year political prisoners are freed and Beijing stops peddling missiles to dictatorships.
President Clinton will be under pressure to waffle. Export-import lobbies will tell him, hell, it's a fool's game to give up business with China.
And even if he lifts tariff privileges, millions will still be enslaved and Tibet occupied. China's people will still live under despotism and the Communist army still will grow.
So what's the use? How about this:
"China cannot withstand forever the forces of democratic change. One day it will go the way of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The United States must do what it can to encourage that process."
Mr. Clinton said that on Sept. 14, 1992, when he was running for President. It was true then and it is true now, and more important to peace and human dignity with every Communist-made rocket, every scream from the cells.

HEADLINE: Korean Shop Owners Fearful Of Outcome of Beating Trial

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 9

 BODY:
When customers at Elizabeth Hwang's tiny, graffiti-covered convenience store get angry, they know how to frighten her. They say, "We're going to burn down your store."
They tried once before, during the riots a year ago, and now Miss Hwang and her family are preparing for new attacks on Korean businesses if the city erupts again in violence when a verdict is reached in the new trial of the four officers accused of beating Rodney G. King. 
 "We are scared again, same as last year," said Miss Hwang, a 24-year-old college student who quit her studies after the riot to help out full time at her aging parents' market in South-Central Los Angeles, one of the toughest parts of town.
This fear runs throughout the city as people await the verdicts. Gun sales have risen, and schools have prepared to keep children inside their classrooms. National guardsmen have moved into staging areas and county hospitals have readied their emergency rooms to handle riot victims.
Last year, Korean businesses were the primary target of looters and arsonists, suffering more than $350 million in damage, or nearly half the city's total, a recent survey found. The Hwang store suffered $28,000 in damage and stolen goods, but the Hwangs can count themselves lucky simply to be open.
Of 2,100 Korean businesses burned or looted last year, fewer than one in four have reopened, according to the survey conducted by the Korean American Inter-Agency Council, a coalition of nine groups and agencies.
The economic blow suffered by the nation's largest Korean-American community was so severe that for some residents the classic immigrant pattern has been reversed: people in the homeland have taken up collections and sent them aid.
As the Federal civil rights trial of the four officers approaches its conclusion close to the anniversary of the riot that followed their acquittals on state assault charges last April 29, many of the 145,000 Koreans who live here are making grim preparations.
Some merchants at flea markets have begun removing their merchandise from their shelves. Storefronts are being fortified with extra Plexiglas and bars. Churches are holding special prayer services. Throughout the community, shop owners are getting ready to defend themselves as if on the eve of a war.
Like many others, Miss Hwang's family is armed now -- with a Glock 17 pistol, a Beretta and a shotgun -- and they plan to barricade themselves in their store to fight off looters. Last year, she said, she slept in the store for a month after the riot.
"In our family all we have is this store," said Miss Hwang as she served her mostly black and Hispanic customers in a nonstop stream -- a packet of cookies, a bottle of fortified wine, two cans of beer. "This is our life. If we have no store, we don't eat."
Her sales for the most part were accompanied with smiles and friendly chatter. She said most of her customers were regulars who would do her no harm.
About a third of Korean businesses in Los Angeles are, like Miss Hwang's, scattered around South-Central. Another third are clustered just to the north in the bustling immigrant enclave of Koreatown, where David Joo was also serving customers nonstop at the Western Gun Shop.
"Best business since just after the riots," he said, pausing for just a moment between the sale of a Luger and a shotgun. "Two times better than normal. Maybe three times."
Gun buyers, virtually all of them of Korean descent, crowded his shop, some in business suits, some carrying leather briefcases. One walked out with his suit jacket slung over an assault rifle.
"These days we are selling almost everything," Mr. Joo said. "But the big difference since the riot is that we are selling a lot of long guns, like shotguns and rifles, including high-powered military rifles like the commercial model of the M-16."
The gun sales have been fueled as well by what community leaders say is a rising level of violent crimes against Korean merchants. At a recent candlelight demonstration at City Hall, organizers said that in the six weeks from Feb. 5 to March 21, five Korean merchants had been killed in 13 violent attacks.
Keun Kim, a grocer who owns 11 guns, said shoplifters have become more brazen, walking out of his store without trying to conceal their stolen 12-packs of beer.
 
Shoplifters at Ease
 "They know the police don't respond to shoplifting calls any more," Mr. Kim said. "They tell me to go ahead, call the police."
But like some other merchants, Mr. Kim has decided to leave his weapons at home, reasoning that some robbers might consider an armed shopkeeper a challenge and that firearms can be more of a danger than a protection.
During the riot last year, many Korean residents were horrified at a lack of response from an overwhelmed Los Angeles Police Department. For the most part, the police failed to respond to their calls for help.
Mr. Joo was one of those who took matters into his own hands, firing his own pistol outside a Korean-owned jewelry shop after he said a large number of looters had begun shooting. "The L.A.P.D. ran away in half a second," he said in an interview two days afterwards. "I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed."
Since then, the merchants have formed several self-defense patrols, equipped with vehicles, weapons and communications equipment.
Among Mr. Joo's customers this week were representatives of one of the largest of these groups, the Korea Young Adult Team of Los Angeles, who bought five AK-47 assault rifles.
"We made a mistake last year," said Yong Kim, the group's leader. "This time we won't. I don't know why Koreans are always a special target for African-Americans, but if they are going to attack our community then we are going to pay them back."
This is not the life Miss Hwang's family anticipated when they immigrated five years ago. "We never thought there was going to be this much danger," she said.
"It's scary," Miss Hwang said. "They can kill you. It's scary all the time. They've robbed the store three times since last year. They put the gun up to my head."
Now this young immigrant has scaled back her American dream.Asked what she hoped for in her life, she said, "I would like to be where there is not so much danger."

HEADLINE: Lithuanians Lean on Ex-Marxists Amid Free Market's Uncertainties

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania

 BODY:
He describes himself as a construction engineer and a Lithuanian patriot, although he has not worked as an engineer for three months now. In January, Rimantas Pirmaitis was laid off, the sort of thing that would never have happened when the Communists were in charge.
He now sells flowers from a street stand in central Vilnius, earning what he can to support two small children and his wife, who is pregnant. 
 "Of course I still believe in a free Lithuania," said Mr. Pirmaitis, 43, who joined the protests of 1989 and 1990 that forced the first cracks in Soviet rule, and led a year later to Lithuania's independence. "But we are past the time for marches and anthems. What we need now is something real, something we can eat and touch."
 
Inflation Above 600 Percent
 With inflation running at more than 600 percent over the last 12 months, and imports of Russian fuel oil so erratic that few buildings had heat or hot water over the winter, Mr. Pirmaitis and other Lithuanian voters exercised their new democratic option in the hope of improving their economic lot.
In a presidential election in February and in parliamentary balloting last fall, they voted out Vytautas Landsbergis, the musician-turned-politician who led the Lithuanian Government for nearly three years during its confrontation with Moscow, and other liberal reformers of Sajudis, the independence movement that faced down Soviet Army tanks and troops outside the republic's Parliament in early 1991.
In their place, voters turned to a group of reform-minded former Communists turned Social Democrats, including Algirdas Brazauskas, the 60-year-old bearlike former head of Lithuania's Communist Party, who is now the republic's President.
The election results, in which Mr. Brazauskas took more than 60 percent of the votes, easily defeating Stasys Lozoraitus, the Sajudis candidate and Lithuania's current Ambassador to the United States, represented a measure of the degree to which a disintegrating economy has tilted the political debate in this Baltic republic of 3.7 million.
Of the former Soviet satellites and republics, Lithuania is the first in which voters voluntarily agreed to restore power to elements of a political elite from the old Communist system.
Yet there is no evidence to suggest that Lithuanians -- historically among the least compliant members of the old Soviet empire -- are yearning for a return to the good old days of socialist central planning and a rigid command economy. For one thing, Mr. Brazauskas, a longtime Communist maverick who in 1989 was the first provincial party boss to break with Moscow, vowed in the campaign to press forward with Western-style economic reforms, albeit at a more measured pace.
"I'm no miracle maker," Mr. Brazauskas said in a recent interview. "This is the worst situation the Lithuanian economy has been in in this century. All I can say, if we fail to improve the situation here, and someone replaces me who can, then I shall be the first to shake his hand."
 
Value of Knowing The Names of Cows
 In choosing Mr. Brazauskas, Lithuanians opted for a more personal brand of leadership. Mr. Brazauskas, one Western diplomat here said, is as different from Mr. Landsbergis as Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago was from Adlai E. Stevenson.
"One is an intellectual and the other the consummate streetwise politician," the diplomat said. "When Brazauskas goes to a village, he not only remembers the names of the farmers but the names of their cows."
In an economic plan announced in March, Mr. Brazauskas and his new Prime Minister, Adolfas Slezevicius, said they wanted to open doors wider to Western investors, with measures including more liberal banking laws intended to draw foreign capital and legislation to change the Constitution so foreigners could own land in Lithuania.
The Government is also urging major changes in agricultural policy, including slowing the pace of privatization and enforcing a prohibition on breaking up large farms into smaller, unprofitable units.
Interviews with farmers, workers, students and pensioners here underscore that the election returns reflected more a sense of distress and frustration over the nation's economic decline than any second thoughts over their new political freedom. Given a chance to exercise their choice democratically, in a self-satisfied demonstration of their new, post-Soviet political freedom, voters unhesitatingly picked the old-fashioned political pros over the young idealists and nationalist intellectuals of Sajudis.
 
High Hopes Dashed By Unemployment
 "I marched in all the marches and attended all the rallies and believed intensely in Sajudis and Mr. Landsbergis," said Lidija Cesniene, 62, a retired linguist. "But now I am frustrated and disappointed. Sajudis tore down everything, and put nothing up in its place."
Nearby, in the central park where the statue of Lenin once stood, Lina Vaitiekuniene, 34, said the high hopes she had felt when Lithuania had become independent had been dashed. In March she lost her job in an electronics factory near Vilnius.
"I am sorry to say I've become a pessimist," she said. "I hope Brazauskas can make things better; that's why I voted for him. But economically, right now I am worse off than in the old times."
Like that other reformed Communist populist, Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow, Mr. Brazauskas is facing a formidable challenge, and the Baltics are already edgy as they watch political events unfold uncertainly in Russia.
As in the rest of the old empire, the dismantling of the old Soviet system has loosened a riptide of expectations and dizzying possibilities.
Politically and culturally, Lithuania and the rest of the Baltic republics are in full bloom. Shops are filled with Western goods, cafes buzz with conversations between local entreprenuers and foreign investors, and there is a rich exchange of political views in a myriad of publications and broadcasts.
But the demise of the central command economy has also wreaked havoc in the small republic. "These days, you can get anything you want in Lithuania," Joana Snieganiene, 58, said as she shopped in the Kalvarija farm market. "But who can afford the prices?"
Factories that made Soviet-style radios and computers for which there is no longer a market have cut back or stopped production entirely, contributing to unemployment among people who never before had to worry about job security.
The official Government figures show the number of unemployed at 29,100. Unofficially, even ranking members of the Government do not dispute that the real number is probably closer to 200,000.
 
Reform Politicians Were Out of Touch
 As a result of sharp declines in industrial and agricultural production, the Government itself estimates that gross domestic product in 1992 was only 39 percent of what it was the year before.
That Sajudis fell from power was not wholly unexpected. Other broad coalitions that also came to power in Eastern Europe on the strength of their single-minded opposition to the Communists -- including Solidarity in Poland and Civic Forum in Czechoslavakia -- also lost popularity in the face of the economic hardships of post-Soviet reconstruction.
Many people complained that Sajudis was out of touch with the people, particularly in the countryside, where the Sajudis leadership moved quickly to dismantle collective farms and restore private property seized by the Communists without reckoning the consequences it would have on agricultural production.
Vytautas Kazlauskas, 60, a pig farmer from Moletai, about 40 miles from Vilnius, said the Government had given land back to people who did not care to farm it, and provided little help for those who did. "The people in Sajudis just didn't understand the countryside," Mr. Kazlauskas said.
Among other things, new private farmers discovered that they could neither sell the land, if they did not want to farm, nor borrow money for tractors, fertilizers or seed, if they did. Moreover, the Government made no provision to share or lease equipment still in the hands of the old collectives.
With the cost of production rising, output of everything from eggs to milk has fallen sharply, prodding a parallel increase in food prices, which have climbed about 700 percent in the last 12 months. With meat supplies declining too, producers nearly doubled their prices in early April, and the Government, which once supplied meat products throughout the old Soviet Union, now says it must import them from Germany just to satisfy local demand.
While Mr. Brazauskas and his political supporters in Parliament so far have been able to lay the blame at the door of their predecessors, the challenge in the coming months will be to satisfy the growing expectations of Lithuanians that the new Governmnent can get things back on track.
 
Popular Pressure To Raise Spending
 For one thing, Lithuania, the poorest and most rural of the Baltic republics, so far has not attracted anywhere near the same degree of Western investment as Latvia or Estonia.
Western analysts here say the biggest danger is that the Brazauskas Government may react to domestic political pressure by increasing wages, pensions and other benefits at a time when Government revenues are declining and inflation is already rampant. The Government recently said it intended to double pensions if it could find the revenue.
In public appearances since his election, Mr. Brazauskas has gone out of his way to appear as a conciliator and a healer, and to emphasize that he prefers now to be known as a now as a reborn Social Democrat rather than a old-time Communist.
"Let's agree on one thing," he said. "Nobody would vote for a Communist today in Lithuania. People voted for us because we promised to find a less painful way to carry on with reform."
Viktor Petkus, who spent 25 years in Soviet prison camps and now serves as an adviser on human rights to the Lithuanian Parliament, is among those who argue that it is wrong to hound Mr. Brazauskas or other former members of the old Communist Government because of their past.
"Some of those who talk about rooting out the Communists are more Bolshevik than the ones they blame," said Mr. Petkus, who is 62. "I think even the Communists now agree that no river can flow backwards."
Still, the scars of 50 years of Communist domination heal slowly, and many here are determined not to forget. Flowers are still placed regularly alongside the memorial outside the old K.G.B. headquarters in central Vilnius, in memory of those killed in 1991 when Soviet Army troops opened fire on demonstrators.
"They have only changed their name," complained Bronislava Bundziene, 54, a teacher who joined a recent Sajudis demonstration against the Government. "The way they work, the way they think, their goals have not changed. In their hearts, they are still Communists."
Mr. Landsbergis, who now sits in Parliament as the leader of the opposition, warns darkly that Mr. Brazauskas is still surrounded by former servants of the Soviet state, including K.G.B. informers, who may be less willing to stand up to Russia should conservatives or hard-line nationalists gain the upper hand there.
In Vilnius, as in the neighboring Baltic capitals of Riga and Tallinn, the events unfolding in Moscow, in which President Yeltsin is being challenged by former Communists in the Russian Congress, are watched with apprehension.
While Lithuania was the first of the Soviet republics to break with the Soviet leadership, it has moved faster than its Baltic neighbors in repairing relations with Moscow. Lithuania, for example, is the only Baltic state to have negotiated an agreement with Russia on the withdrawal of former Soviet Army units.
 
Defeated President Ponders Situation
 Mr. Landsbergis acknowledges that his leadership was found wanting. "We achieved independence," he said. "But our achievement was not reflected in the living standards of people, and it was not enough to explain that some difficulties were necessary in making the transition to a Western economy."
With the next elections four years off, and the economy still struggling, he says he fears that Mr. Brazauskas will fall back on what he knows best. "Their experience as leaders of a socialist economy is not what we need today," he said of the former Communists back in power. "Either they will be successful, or they will turn back the economy to their own competence."

HEADLINE: IRAQI GUNNERS FIRE ON AMERICAN JETS IN NORTH, U.S. SAYS

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
American fighter jets today bombed Iraqi antiaircraft batteries that fired at the aircraft as they flew a routine surveillance mission over the no-flight zone in northern Iraq, Administration officials said.
But Baghdad denied shooting at the American F-16 and F-4G fighters and said the United States attack had been unprovoked. 
 The incident marked the first challenge to allied aircraft in Iraq since Iraqi gunners fired at French reconnaissance planes on Feb. 3 and the first against American planes since the days immediately after President Clinton's inauguration.
If Iraqi gunners did shoot at the American planes, which the Pentagon said were not hit, it would end a two-month charm offensive Baghdad had waged to persuade the United Nations to lift economic sanctions imposed during the Persian Gulf crisis. The United Nations Security Council agreed Monday to maintain the restrictions, saying that Baghdad had not fulfilled its obligations under the Persian Gulf war cease-fire.
 
New Test of U.S. Resolve?
 Administration officials expressed concern that if Iraq's hostilities were deliberate and are repeated this weekend, it could signal a renewal of Baghdad's efforts to test United States resolve.
"If they start shooting again, it tells me they're starting back toward confrontation, and things could ratchet up very quickly," said one senior Defense Department official who watches the Persian Gulf region closely.
The incident today also coincided with the arrival of the latest group of international inspectors in Baghdad to pursue the United Nations goal of eliminating Iraq's major weapons programs.
In January, during the final days of the Bush Administration, United States warplanes launched two attacks in southern Iraq in retaliation for Baghdad's refusal to abide by United Nations resolutions, including its ban of visits by United Nations weapons inspection teams.
President Saddam Hussein responded by allowing entry for the teams and announcing a unilateral cease-fire in honor of President Clinton's inauguration. But within days after Mr. Clinton took office, the attacks resumed with American fighters firing on Iraqi artillery sites after the Iraqis took what American pilots said were threatening actions.
In late February, Iraqi forces aimed their guns at the helicopters of two inspectors who had mounted a major air-and-ground search west of Baghdad for hidden missiles and missile parts or launchers.
The United States mission to the United Nations said today that it did not plan to summon the Iraqi Ambassador or issue any demands over the attacks, unless such incidents are repeated and become a pattern, The Associated Press reported.
"Iraq understands clearly what its obligations are in regard to the no-fly zone and will be held solely responsible for the serious consequences of failure to comply with these obligations," said the State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher. The United States and its allies have barred Iraqi planes from two areas, in northern Iraq to stop aerial attacks against Kurds and and in southern Iraq to stop attacks against Shiite Muslims.
 
Four Cluster Bombs
 The military's European Command said that at 1:05 P.M. local time, Iraqi antiaircraft batteries two miles east of the Saddam Dam, near Mosul, fired at three American F-16's and one F-4G. Allied aircraft have patrolled the area north of the 36th parallel since the end of the gulf war two years ago.
The sites attacked were about 20 miles inside the northern zone, Pentagon officials said today.
In response, the military said, two of the F-16's dropped a total of four cluster bombs on the batteries, but it was not clear what damage they did. The Pentagon said the fire-control radars of the the artillery batteries were being used at the time. The American planes then returned to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey.
Baghdad, however, immediately denied shooting at the American aircraft.
"The soldiers were having lunch at the time," Gen. Abdeljawad Dhanoun, the governor of Nineveh province, told Iraqi state television. "There was no state of preparedness or firing by the air defense forces in the region of Saddam Dam in northern Iraq."
Administration officials, in turn, discounted the Iraqi denials, but acknowledged that it was unclear whether the incident was ordered by the authorities in Baghdad or were actions taken by local commanders.
"We'll have to see what happens over the weekend," one Defense Department official said. "Maybe it was a localized incident."
Allied air patrols generally fly at altitudes that are out of range of most Iraqi guns. But firing the antiaircraft batteries is viewed as a challenge to the coalition's enforcement of the no-flight zone.
In addition to the antiaircraft guns, American officials also contended that the Iraqis directed radar at the American planes. The United States considers the use of such radars as a threatening act and a possible prelude to firing missiles from surface-to-air batteries.
Pentagon officials said there were no incidents south of the 32d parallel in the no-flight zone intended to protect the Shiites.

HEADLINE: REJECTION IS SEEN FOR A TAX CREDIT AIMED AT BUSINESS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
The tax break to encourage business investment that President Clinton has proposed as a central element in his plan to stimulate the economy and create jobs is not likely to be enacted, leading lawmakers in both parties say.
That means Mr. Clinton may get almost none of the measures he has sought to give the economy a quick jolt. The other half of the stimulus program, a spending bill, has been blocked in the Senate by a Republican filibuster and stands no chance of passage in its current form. 
 The proposed investment tax credit, meant to induce businesses to buy new machinery and equipment, has won little support in Congress or in business circles.
 
Congressional Leaders Opposed
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in an interview recently that the tax credit, which would cost the Government more than $21 billion in lost revenue over five years, was an integral part of the President's economic package and that the Administration would fight to preserve it.
It was supposed to be part of the tax bill that Congressional committees will begin drafting next month, with the idea that the credit would be retroactive so it could be applied to purchases made after last Dec. 3.
But the chairmen of the Congressional tax committees -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, and Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee -- said they were opposed to the proposal because it would open an unnecessary tax loophole and did not know of much support in either party on their committees.
Even the National Association of Manufacturers, which represents the kinds of businesses that are among the heaviest buyers of machinery and equipment, is opposed to the Clinton proposal.
 
Criticism From Industry
 "It is a bad idea that will simply shift investment from the future forward," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, the association's president.
Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economics consulting company, said of Administration officials, "They can't find a friend for it in Congress or in industry."
Mr. Clinton and his spokesmen have maintained that the stimulus program is needed because the economy is recovering so slowly from the recession and relatively few new jobs are being created. Some economists favor the proposals and some do not, but the prevailing view is that the effect of a $30 billion stimulus over two years in a $6 trillion economy would be marginal.
As for the political consequences, the rejection of a large portion of the President's stimulus package will probably be forgotten if Mr. Clinton succeeds in winning approval of the basic elements of the budget he submitted to Congress on Thursday.
The opposition to the investment tax credit proposal comes from several directions:
*Some opponents believe it will be a waste of money.
*Others are philosophically opposed to skewing the marketplace with tax incentives.
*Others note that while the President was giving with one hand he would take away with another, by raising the tax rate on corporate profits to 36 percent from 34 percent; they say they would rather keep the lower rate than have an investment credit.
*Still others say they favor an investment tax credit in a different form.
Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Rostenkowski, who were interviewed separately in their offices, said they expected the fight in Congress to be over what else to do with the $21 billion, not over whether to approve an investment tax credit.
"That's our cushion," Mr. Moynihan said. "It's going to be used in place of revenue from some other tax."
 
Other Proposals for Money
 Mr. Rostenkowski said it was even possible that the money saved by not approving the tax credit would be used to lower the Federal deficit further.
An investment tax credit was first put on the books in the Kennedy Administration. It expired and was reinstated several times until it was finally repealed, supposedly for good, by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The main theme of the 1986 law, which Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Rostenkowski strongly supported, was lower tax rates and the elimination of tax breaks.
"I have spent a lot of effort getting mischief out of the tax code," Mr. Rostenkowski said.
But Mr. Clinton has a different philosophy. He believes that businesses and individuals should sometimes be given tax incentives to accomplish economic and social goals.
In his election campaign last year, Mr. Clinton offered an investment tax credit as one of the main aspects of his effort to generate more private investment. "Putting People First," the Clinton campaign manifesto, observed that the Japanese invested twice as much per person as Americans and he promised "a targeted investment tax credit to encourage investment in new plants and productive equipment here at home that we need to compete in the global economy."
 
Plan Smaller Than Expected
 The actual proposal sent to Congress in February proved to be much more modest than many business executives and economists had expected based on the campaign oratory.
First, the credit would be only 7 percent rather than 10 percent as some had anticipated. Second, it would be what is known as an incremental credit, meaning it could be claimed only on the amount of investments above the average investments in previous years. Third, it would last only for two years for companies with sales of more than $5 million a year. For smaller companies, the credit would be permanent, but it would drop to 5 percent after two years. (As an illustration, a successful automobile dealership or a machine shop with 50 employees might have annual sales of $5 million.)
Administration officials said they favored an incremental credit so businesses would get no tax break for investments that would have been made anyway. The officials said they wanted the credit for big businesses to expire after two years to hold down the cost and to get the benefit of the new investment as quickly as possible.
"What the President is looking for is the most bang for the buck," Mr. Bentsen said.
As a matter of theory, economists are divided on the wisdom of an investment tax credit generally, but few support an incremental, temporary credit.
Laurence H. Meyer, a prominent economic forecaster based in St. Louis who was commissioned by the Clinton campaign to do a pre-election study of investment tax credits, is a strong believer that a permanent credit would generate new investment, create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and lead to significant improvement in the economy.
But in an interview this week, Mr. Meyer said that a temporary tax break would simply be a disruption, causing companies "to shift investments to 1994 that would have taken place anyway in 1995."
Mr. Meyer said he was intrigued by the notion of allowing the credit only for investments above a certain level. But he said he doubted that an incremental credit would be workable on a permanent basis because companies would master the rules and find ways to get around the law.
Jane G. Gravelle, a senior specialist in tax and economic policy at the Library of Congress, said the Clinton proposal would be an administrative nightmare and would punish companies that invested during the recession while rewarding those that did not.
The Administration hoped that the announcement that the credit would be retroactive would induce companies to step up their purchases of machinery and equipment early this year. Economists and representatives of trade associations who follow such matters said they saw no indications that many companies had done so.
Executives of companies like those in the airline and computer industries who might be expected to support an investment tax credit said the Clinton proposal was too small to make much differences in their businesses.
"The carrot is so small, I find very few people if any in favor," said Mark A. Bloomfield, president of the American Council for Capital Formation, an association here that lobbies for measures to make business investment more attractive.
 
 
 
STIMULUS PROPOSALS: WHAT CLINTON WANTS
Tax Credits: $21.4 billion
Large companies could subtract from their tax bills part of the cost of equiptment bought between Dec. 4, 1992, and the end of 1994.
Companies with annual sales of less than $5 million could continue to take the tax credit after 1994.
 
 Spending: $19.5 billion.
Major items include $3 billion for highways, $2.5 billion for construction grants for local governments and $4 billion for unemployment compensation
 
Democrats say the package woulf give the economy a lift and rebuild national assets. But Republicans say the measure id laden with port barrel projects.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Send General to Vietnam, Hinting a Thaw

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
In its first policy decision on Vietnam, the Clinton Administration will send John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general, to Hanoi on a fact-finding mission on missing American servicemen, a move that could lead the United States to withdraw its opposition to international bank lending to Vietnam, senior Administration officials said today.
The officials stressed that President Clinton will make no decision on easing any American pressure on Vietnam until he is convinced that Hanoi is doing all it can to cooperate with the American authorities on the contentious and emotional issue of Americans missing since the Vietnam War. 
 But the Administration is trying to work out the broad outlines of a Vietnam policy before late April, when the International Monetary Fund will decide whether to take steps toward resuming lending to Hanoi. France, Germany, Japan and a number of Asian nations are poised to lend Vietnam enough money to repay its longstanding I.M.F. debts, which could allow Vietnam to qualify for new loans.
The new Administration is caught between its isolation on the loan issue and its desire to increase Vietnam's commercial dealings with the rest of the world on the one hand, and the reluctance of Mr. Clinton, who opposed the Vietnam War and did not serve in the military, to take any step that would expose him to criticism that he is soft on Vietnam.
Mr. Clinton cannot afford another bruising battle, given the controversy over his own military record and the furor over the issue of whether to lift the ban on allowing declared homosexuals to serve in the military.
For his part, Secretary of State Warren Christopher is keenly aware that Vietnam, a country of 70 million people, is a great untapped business opportunity, one he does not want American businesses to lose to foreign competitors. Liberal and even some conservative lawmakers have begun calling for more liberalized relations with Hanoi.
But senior Administration officials stress that even if the United States were to end its opposition to international loans to Vietnam, lifting the 18-year-old American trade embargo is another matter, and would happen only slowly and in stages. Some senior officials speak of the possibility of an eventual economic relationship with Vietnam but no full-scale normalization of diplomatic relations.
 
General's New Mission
 In a question-and-answer session after a speech on American foreign policy, Mr. Christopher raised expectations that the United States might lift the embargo. Asked about the American approach to the embargo, he repeated the Administration's conditions, but said, "It's unfortunate that many other countries around the world are getting ahead of us in their commercial endeavors in Vietnam and I hope that we can enable our businesses and industries to catch up by moving more rapidly down the road."
General Vessey, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was the Bush Administration's special envoy to Hanoi, will seek detailed information on a range of issues, including full American access to Vietnam's archives, the resolution of outstanding cases where there are discrepancies in reports, and the return of the remains of American soldiers. The Administration acknowledges Vietnam's increased cooperation in the last 18 months, but there are differences between senior officials over the lending issue.
When asked on Thursday about the pending vote at the I.M.F., one senior Administration official said, "I think the United States Government hopes very much to be in a position to join the group that is positive about the situation in Vietnam." But he added that Mr. Clinton is firmly committed to insuring that the United States gets all the available information on the missing Americans.
 
Vietnam's Burden of Proof
 Other senior officials involved in the decision said that they were not yet satisfied that Vietnam had fully cooperated on the issue and that the burden of proof was on the Vietnamese.
Even some of the most conservative members of Congress have urged the new Administration to make a concrete gesture toward the Hanoi Government.
"I've been a hard-liner in a lot of ways," Senator Larry Pressler, a South Dakota Republican, said last month during the Senate confirmation hearing of Winston Lord as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. "I'm a Vietnam veteran and served two tours there," he said. But he added that the time has come for President Clinton to "recognize Vietnam."
Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, who recently issued a comprehensive report on the fate of several hundred American servicemen missing since the Vietnam war, asked Mr. Lord to explain why the new Administration was so willing to engage with China as a way to push for change there, but took a "don't be involved" approach toward Vietnam.
Last fall, the Bush Administration made conciliatory gestures toward Vietnam after receiving what officials considered extraordinary assistance in identifying missing Americans. Mr. Bush allowed American companies to open offices in Vietnam and to sign agreements that would take effect as soon as the United States lifted the embargo, but he left the White House without doing so.

HEADLINE: Travel Industry Protests U.S. Stance on Fares

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Late last month, the nation's airlines cut fares about 30 percent on certain coach tickets purchased at least 14 days in advance. While all carriers tell passengers of the various restrictions, Northwest and USAir do not add that the tickets must be purchased by April 21, because that would tip the public to a possible fare change the following day.
Why the big secret? Both airlines fear that the disclosure would run afoul of Justice Department recommendations made as part of a civil antitrust suit against eight leading airlines, accusing them of price fixing and restraining price competition. 
 The department's proposed remedy, which came in the form of a consent decree that it unsuccessfully tried to compel all eight airlines to sign, prevents airlines from discussing their fare changes until they advertise them publicly.
That provision has much of the travel industry up in arms, worried that such a proposed remedy could itself restrain price competition.
Delta Air Lines, one of the six carriers that have not signed the decree, contends that the airlines would become the only American industry barred from discussing sales and price increases in advance of public notice. The computer reservation system was assembled to give travel agents -- and therefore passengers -- an idea of future prices.
"This is a bullying misuse of power that will work to the detriment of travelers," said John Noble, chief executive of Northwestern Business Travel in Minneapolis.
Even consumer organizations, which might have been expected to applaud the suit, have misgivings. The proposed solution is opposed by at least a dozen organizations, including those representing corporate travel executives and restaurants, and even the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, a group of lawmakers that examines ways to promote tourism in the United States. Many of the opponents contend that denying consumers information about fare reductions and increases means they will end up paying more.
Cornish F. Hitchcock, a lawyer and aviation specialist for Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said, "As strange as it is to be criticizing an antitrust initiative, I'm not sure the public will be better off if the Government wins."
Linda Golodner, president of the National Consumers League, said the department's proposed remedy "has not been well thought out" and "would do far more harm than good."
 Several weeks ago, executives of 14 large associations -- including several representing travel agents -- asked President Clinton to advise Attorney General Janet Reno to seek a voluntary stay of the Justice Department proceedings so the new Administration could review the action taken in the final days of the Bush Administration.
Not all of those associations categorically reject the charge that the carriers colluded to fix prices. But they say the Government should seek different remedies.
The object of so much wrath began with the suit filed by the Justice Department's antitrust division on Dec. 21 against American, United, Delta, Northwest, USAir, Continental, Trans World and Alaska Airlines.
Also named as a defendant was the Airline Tariff Publishing Company, a fare-data collection and dissemination service owned by a group of airlines, including those eight.
 
 
Signals on Prices
 The complaint contended that since at least April 1988 and continuing through at least May 1990, the airlines at various times agreed among themselves to raise particular fares and eliminate particular discounts for travel between specific cities.
In January, J. Mark Gidley, the acting assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, said that the airlines used the tariff publishing company to communicate proposed prices to competitors and reach agreements on fare increases. The process of posting proposed increases and counterproposals with the publisher, he said, enabled the carriers to agree on fares before they were offered to the public.
To remedy the supposed violations, the Government asked the eight carriers to sign a decree agreeing to stop providing the publisher with the starting and ending dates for future fares, unless they publicly advertise the ending date of a new promotional fare. The suit seeks no penalties, but the decree would require the airlines to change procedures for 10 years.
All eight airlines denied breaking the law, noting that the same system that they used to announce fare increases is also used to announce reductions -- including last summer's record-breaking half-price sale.
 Nevertheless, two airlines signed the consent decree: USAir, which at the time was seeking Government approval for what became a $300 million investment by British Airways, and United, whose motivation mystified its competitors.
"We were not guilty of any offense," said Stephen M. Wolf, United's chief executive. "But it became a case of how much it would cost us in legal fees."
Since signing the decree, United announced plans in March to buy USAir's operating authority between Philadelphia and Gatwick Airport near London. United wants to transform that flight into a flight serving O'Hare Airport in Chicago and the more desirable Heathrow in London, and it would need Government approval to make the change.
American and Northwest, while insisting that they have done nothing wrong, are informally complying with the decree, figuring that this will protect them against private triple-damage lawsuits from consumers.
Neither carrier provides advance notice of fare changes anymore, or uses a final ticketing date on promotional fares unless that date is included in advertising. In addition, American no longer responds to questions from the press about whether it is matching a rival's fare, or the dates a new fare begins or ends, unless it has advertised that information.
 Travel agents, who book more than 80 percent of domestic air travel, have been particularly upset by the Justice Department suit. If successful, it would mean that the carriers -- and by extension, the agents -- could guarantee a fare only if a ticket was purchased the same day the quote was made. And, they added, a successful suit would in effect give a Federal judge authority to regulate prices.
"The Government does not sue Chevrolet for announcing what next year's models will cost," the American Society of Travel Agents said, "even though it is understood that the price may be adjusted upward or downward depending upon how their competitors price their own new line. The fact that this information exchange goes on more rapidly due to computers does not change the principle."
Delta has not agreed to sign or abide by the Government decree.
The United States District Court in Washington, meanwhile, has given the carriers until Oct. 1 to file motions for summary judgment, and if they fail to win a summary dismissal the trial is set for next Feb. 14.
Opponents of the Government suit say they cannot understand why it was brought by the Bush Administration's Justice Department. But some of them speculate privately that Mr. Gidley had wanted to increase his visibility to land a job with a prominent Washington law firm.
Indeed, Mr. Gidley recently followed William P. Barr, the former Attorney General, to the high-powered firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge. But Mr. Gidley denies having had ulterior motives.
 
 
Decision Is Defended
 "It was a complex investigation, begun under one of my predecessors and prosecuted with intensity over a three-year period," he said. He added that the case was supported by the Justice Department's career staff; by its chief economist, Barry Harris, and by his superior, Wayne Budd, the Associate Attorney General.
 As for the timing of the case and the opposition of a variety of organizations, Mr. Gidley said: "We don't shut down the Justice Department after an election. We bring cases as we're able to decide them. And we decide the cases based on the facts and the law. You don't conduct head counts."
Moreover, Mr. Gidley said he had no second thoughts about bringing the case. "I'd be stunned if anybody at the Justice Department disagreed that I'm a conservative antitrust lawyer," he said. "So the fact that I brought this case should show you something about the strength of the case."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Easing Rules for Moscow Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
Under heavy pressure from the Clinton Administration and other Western governments, the International Monetary Fund is moving to ease restrictions on aid to Russia with the aim of freeing several billion dollars in assistance.
The much-needed burst of new assistance to the suffering Russian economy would follow a year when the monetary fund gave Moscow far less money than anticipated because Russia failed to take the strict austerity measures the fund demanded. 
 In the face of criticism that the fund has done too little for Russia, fund officials said a program they hope to set up by late April could provide about $4.5 billion in loans in the next few months, without the usual tough requirements for slashing inflation and budget deficits.
 
Urgent Aid for Imports
 The fund's 24-member board on Thursday informally endorsed the new program to provide urgent aid to countries whose tattered economies are making the transition from Communism. Officials from the fund said their new aid program would help finance desperately needed imports.
In a news briefing today, a senior Treasury Department official, who spoke under condition of anonymity, praised the plans, but signaled impatience with the amount of aid the fund has provided at a time when President Boris N. Yeltsin is fighting with conservatives for survival.
"This is not a situation where aid can be delayed until every 'i' is dotted and every 't' is crossed," the official said. The official noted that the fund's loans are expected to be part of the package that the finance and foreign ministers of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations are expected to unveil in Tokyo on April 14 and 15.
Anticipating similar pressures, World Bank officials have proposed to their board of directors that $4 billion in loans, more than double the amount they were considering just last month, be provided to Russia over the next 12 to 18 months.
At a time when most industrial nations are plagued by anemic growth and budget deficits, the Clinton Administration and Group of Seven Governments are looking increasingly to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to help Russia.
Speaking about these international lending institutions, the Treasury official said, "They're certainly going to be very important players in any ongoing efforts to support Russia."
In today's briefing, the official called on Japan, as host of next week's meeting, to make a substantial new aid commitment to Russia.
 
Expansion Considered
 Monetary fund officials said the new program may also provide aid to the 14 other former Soviet republics as well as to Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
But the creation of this more generous program was obviously a response to the desire to help keep Russia from falling into chaos as it adopts measures to bring its economy under control.
"This is probably the greatest economic reform task that the world has ever faced," the senior Treasury officials said. "The design of policy needs to be very sensitive to that."
Officials from the International Monetary Fund denied that they were reacting to American pressures in creating this program. But one American official said it was no coincidence that the fund was acting with such urgency soon after American officials had indicated in private that they thought the fund was being too cautious with Russia.
 
Broke Vow on Inflation
 The monetary fund was supposed to provide Russia with $3.5 billion in loans last year, but it ended up providing only $1 billion. Russian officials had pledged to reduce inflation to less than 10 percent a month, but the central bank printed so many rubles to plug its budget deficit and to keep teetering enterprises afloat that inflation soared to 25 percent a month.
American and monetary fund officials said they hoped this new program would lead to Russia's signing a stricter aid agreement with the fund by October. Under such an accord, known as a standby agreement, not only would Russia qualify for another $4 billion in loans, but it could also receive an additional $6 billion supervised by the fund to stabilize the ruble.
The fund hopes to win full approval for the plan by its spring meeting on April 30.
Some fund officials said one proposal would be to let Russia receive two $2 billion loans, one for 1992 and one for 1993. Another $500 million might also be made available as a supplement under a temporary aid agreement signed last year.
 
Germany Cites Its Burdens
 German officials have also called on the fund and the World Bank to carry more of the aid burden, asserting that Germany not only has a huge budget deficit and the burden of rebuilding eastern Germany, but that it has also provided far more aid to Russia than any other country.
Under the World Bank proposals, its $4 billion in possible loans would include $250 million to help develop a private banking system, $100 million for management training, and $100 million to develop a social safety net.
There would also be $600 million to modernize farming and $500 million for the oil industry. The plan also suggests $300 million for highway rehabilitation and $400 million for emergency housing construction, especially to help house soldiers returning from postings outside Russia. There would also be a new $600 million loan to finance critical imports, in addition to a $600 million loan already committed for that purpose.

HEADLINE: Slowing Health Costs Help To Hold Down Price Index

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
The deceleration in medical inflation intensified in March, the Government's consumer price report showed today, with health-care costs rising by the smallest amount in nine years.
The rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in medical costs last month magnified a slowdown that has been under way since early 1991. Medical inflation for the first quarter of the year fell to an annual rate of 5.6 percent, down from 6.6 percent in 1992, 7.9 percent in 1991 and 9.6 percent in 1990. 
 The slim rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in the overall Consumer Price Index banished fears that hefty increases in January and February in the so-called core inflation rate might have signaled revived inflation. In March, the core rate, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose just one-tenth of 1 percent, the same as the overall rate. The core rate rose by five-tenths of 1 percent in January and in February.
Analysts warned against concluding that health costs were no longer a serious national problem, and there seemed no likelihood that the Clinton Administration would act less urgently in drafting its plan for health-care overhaul, now due in mid-May.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chief economic adviser to President Clinton, said that while she was "edified" by the latest price results, the cost of health care was only one of the factors driving the effort for change.
She cited the intensity of health-care usage, which sometimes leads to unnecessary tests or procedures, and the need to expand insurance coverage to some 35 million people who now lack it. Dr. Tyson noted that those without insurance now resort to some of the most costly treatment, in hospital emergency rooms.
Still, the latest figures did seem to confirm that medical costs have been increasingly restrained for some time and that the attention given by the Clinton Administration has already had an effect.
Analysts said that while there was no way to quantify these forces, it was clear that the recession and the lagging job and income growth that followed had been a big factor.
"The medical sector is not immune to what goes on in the economy," Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said. "It's not as out of touch as many people seem to think."
More recently, there has been a move among drug companies to limit price increases to no more than the general rate of inflation, an effort intended to head off more drastic action by the Government. At the same time, there seems to have been no rush by companies to put price increases into effect quickly in advance of possible controls.
 
Drug and Doctor Fees Restrained

 
 Although figures for short periods are often suspect, it appears that much of the recent medical price restraint has been concentrated in prescription drugs and in the services of physicians.
Drug prices rose at a 4.4 percent pace in the first three months of the year, compared with 5.7 percent in 1992 and 9.4 percent in 1991. For doctors' fees, the first-quarter rate of increase was 3.9 percent, far below the 6.3 percent that prevailed last year.
The direction of costs for hospital and related services, by contrast, seems less clear. At an 8.6 percent annual rate of increase in the first quarter, these costs were rising only slightly slower than in 1992 and 1991, when they rose by 8.8 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively. But the first-quarter rate of increase represented an improvement from 1990's 11.3 percent jump.
Medical costs, which account for 7 percent of the Consumer Price Index, actually posted their biggest increases in the 1970's and early 1980's. Still, after the expiration of general price controls, they tended to be roughly in line with the general level of inflation.
For the past 10 years, though, medical inflation has averaged 7.2 percent, nearly double the 3.8 percent average for consumer prices as a whole.
For the latest 12 months, medical inflation ran at a 6 percent pace, with successive quarterly increases of 6.4, 6.0, 6.2 and 5.6 percent, today's report showed. March's rise of three-tenths of 1 percent was the lowest since a rise of two-tenths in March 1984.
Elsewhere in the Consumer Price Index, the major changes were in clothing and in transportation.
Apparel prices, which rose sharply during the first two months of the year, fell five-tenths of 1 percent, accounting for more than two-thirds of the deceleration from February's C.P.I. increase of three-tenths of 1 percent.
The rise in transportation eased to one-tenth of 1 percent from five-tenths of 1 percent on downturns for fuels and airline fares that outweighed a 1.3 percent jump in the price of used cars and a small rise for new cars.

HEADLINE: In New Jersey Campaign, It's the Consultants, Stupid

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 9

 BODY:
Ask Ed Rollins what the big issue in the New Jersey governor's race is and he will tell you without hesitation: "It's the economy, stupid."
Mr. Rollins, who managed Ronald Reagan's 1984 "Morning in America" campaign, knows a good line when he hears it, and he does not mind the sweeping bow in the direction of James Carville, whom, if all goes as Mr. Rollins plans, he will confront in the fall in a clash of consulting titans. 
 Mr. Carville, "the Ragin' Cajun," will be handling the re-election campaign of Gov. Jim Florio, and Mr. Rollins is in the corner of Christine Todd Whitman, who is both a leading candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor and a personal friend.
"Actually, Carville is more interesting than Florio," said Mr. Rollins, who, like the Governor, was an accomplished amateur boxer who cannot resist throwing a jab or two when the opportunity arises.
The prospect of having a front-row seat as two nationally known advisers exchange blows has tantalized those in New Jersey political circles, although both men are quick to offer metaphors designed to put their roles in perspective: "She runs the race; I'm just the jockey," says Mr. Rollins. "I'm the tail; he's the dog," says Mr. Carville.
The Governor is unopposed in the June 8 Democratic primary. To get a chance at him in the fall, Mrs. Whitman, with Mr. Rollins's help, must first get past the other major Republican candidates, former Attorney General Cary Edwards and former State Senator James H. Wallwork.
 
A Third Heavy Hitter
 Mr. Edwards's chief campaign consultant is Jay Smith, also a Washington-based consultant, who, while not so well known as Mr. Rollins and Mr. Carville, also has a solid record. Since 1976, his firm, Smith & Haroff, has won 82 of the 98 races it has handled, mostly for the House, Senate and governorships. One of Mr. Smith's better-known clients was John H. Sununu, the three-time governor of New Hampshire who went on to become George Bush's White House chief of staff.
Mr. Wallwork, beginning an energetic campaign as a conservative alternative to Mr. Edwards and Mrs. Whitman, has signed up a formidable political pollster and media consultant, Arthur Finkelstein of New York City, who has assisted scores of Republican candidates, most recently Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York in a tough race last year.
Nobody is giving away blueprints of their strategies, but some clues have emerged.
Mr. Carville, for example, tipped his hand a bit in a recent speech to a group of Democratic women in Washington that dealt primarily with President Clinton, for whom he is still working as a consultant.
"I look at my client, Governor Florio in New Jersey, as a great Democrat who stood up to and backed down the National Rifle Association," he said. "There is more backbone and courage in the Democratic Party than there has been in a long time, and we ought to reward that kind of courage."
 
Portrait Is Painted
 In an interview, Mr. Carville said he would like to portray Jim Florio as a man who did what was necessary without regard to special interests.
Discussing Mr. Florio's long-running fight with the National Rifle Association over assault weapons, he said: "I certainly think we should talk about the way the Governor stood up to the gun lobby and how the good guys won. But I don't think we are going to win just running against the N.R.A.
"The big issue is the Governor," he said, "what he has done, what he has done. Match him against his opponents and what they have done and what they want to do. It's going to be a tough election, but I signed on a year ago, and if we continue on the path we are on, we have got a good chance."
Mr. Carville is paying close attention to Mrs. Whitman and her wealth.
"Here is someone with wealth, a person of privilege," Mr. Carville said.
Like Mr. Clinton's first nominee for Attorney General, Zoe Baird, Mrs. Whitman ran into criticism for hiring a couple as domestic help and failing to pay their taxes. She subsequently paid the back taxes and fines. Mr. Edwards also admitted hiring a housekeeper and not paying her taxes until recently.
Mrs. Whitman has had further problems. Despite a net worth in excess of $1 million dollars, she gets a tax break on two family properties totaling some 300 acres because she and her family raise livestock for sale, allowing the properties to be classified as agricultural lands and reducing their taxable value by more than $5 million.
She was also accused of using workers from the Board of Public Utilities, of which she was president, to advise her on buying a satellite dish at one of the properties.
"She's like the comic-strip character Pigpen," Mr. Smith said in a telephone interview. "She walks down the street and gets dirty."
Mrs. Whitman has denied the allegation by Mr. Edwards regarding the satellite dish and termed it "desperation scorched-earth politics" on his part. Mr. Edwards trails her substantially in polls.
 
'Outsider' Is the Word
 For his part, Mr. Rollins seeks to hone Mrs. WHitman's image as a political outsider. Although she was born swaddled in political bunting, daughter of a Republican Party state chairman, Webster Todd, and once presented Dwight D. Eisenhower with a leather golf-tee bag she made at camp, she has held office only as a county freeholder and president of the utilities board, appointed by Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
She soared to political prominence in 1990 by coming within 1 percentage point of defeating Bill Bradley for the United States Senate.
Mr. Rollins agrees that she has "great instincts" for politics, but he said: "She is an outsider. What I want to say is that she is not part of the old-boy network of Trenton."
And what of Mr. Carville?
"He is one of the hottest political consultants in the country," said Mr. Rollins. "He has never failed to keep his thumb on the pulse; he understands blue-collar people and values.
"But now he is the Establishment; he now has to defend the record of an incumbent. Christie gets to be like Bill Clinton, attack the record."
In the presidential race, Mr. Rollins said, "Voters wanted an alternative to George Bush," just as a majority, according to polls, now wants an alternative to Mr. Florio. "George Bush couldn't convince the voters the second term would be different," and neither, Mr. Rollins believes, will Mr. Florio.
"The message will be very much like the Clinton message," he said. "The message is change." Mrs. Whitman will also emphasize job losses in New Jersey during the Florio years, he said, emphasizing the approach "The economy, stupid."
 
'Nasty Campaign' Is Expected
 But before she can directly take on Mr. Florio, Mrs. Whitman has to get by her Republican opponents in what Mr. Rollins predicts will be "a dirty, nasty campaign."
Noting that Mr. Edwards is trailing Mrs. Whitman in the polls, Mr. Rollins said, "He has no avenue except to go extremely negative." He said Mrs. Whitman will reply in kind only if attacked.
In radio commercials already being broadcast, Mrs. Whitman is emphasizing the positives with six spots laying out her program for economic renewal. Each one ends with the slogan, "Common sense, uncommon leadership."
As for Mr. Edwards, an early commercial, as predicted, assails Mrs. Whitman as soft on crime and out of touch with common folk. "Can you believe Christine Todd Whitman?" the commercial begins.
The commercial, produced by Mr. Smith, attempts to capitalize on a statement by Mrs. Whitman a week ago in response to Mr. Edwards's anti-crime proposals, which he has made a keystone of his campaign.
"It's all well and good that the former Attorney General wants to talk about an issue with which he's most comfortable, but the real issue is Jim Florio and taxes," she said.
"If he thinks we are going to sit by and let him distort her record without dealing with his own," Mr. Rollins said, "he should remember I can play hardball with the best of them."

HEADLINE: Dollar Lower in Japan; Holiday Slows Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell against major currencies in light trading yesterday, hitting a new low in Japan.
The American markets for Treasury securities, stocks, commodities and gold were closed for Good Friday; most European stock and precious metals markets were also closed. 
 The dollar finished slightly lower in quiet trading, pressured by the news that United States consumer prices rose just a tenth of a percent in March. Lower inflation suggests that interest rates will not rise, making the dollar less competitive than the high-yielding German mark.
 
Hostilities in Iraq
 New fighting involving American warplanes and Iraqi ground artillery in northern Iraq failed to encourage the usual buying of the dollar that occurs in times of global turmoil.
"If the Iraq crisis were to become protracted over the weekend, we could get a reaction in the foreign exchange market Monday, but not today," Richard Pontius of Standard Chartered Bank in Los Angeles said yesterday.
The dollar finished in New York at 1.6047 German marks, from 1.6075 on Thursday. The British pound settled at $1.5280, up from $1.5265 late on Thursday, and the dollar held steady against the yen in New York, ending at 113.12 yen, down slightly from 113.40 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday, included: 1.4760 Swiss francs, down from 1.4792; 5.4295 French francs, down from 5.4375; 1,568 Italian lire, down from 1,574, and Canadian 1.2571 dollars, unchanged.
Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates on Thursday, included: 1.6079 German marks, up from 1.6075; 1.4770 Swiss francs, down from 1.4795; 5.4410 French francs, up from 5.4370; 1.8050 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8063; 1,570.00 Italian lire, down from 1,571.50, and 1.2570 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2578.
 
New Low in Tokyo
 In Tokyo, the dollar ended at 113.15 Japanese yen, a new closing low, down from 113.65 at Thursday's close.
Speculators sold as they detected no signs of intervention by the Bank of Japan, which repeatedly acted earlier this week to slow the yen's surge. Traders eager to square their books ahead of the holiday accelerated the dollar's fall.
"Many people expected intervention, but as there was no sign of its appearance or even a rumor of it, some people took advantage to sell dollars," a dealer said.
Tokyo stocks closed slightly lower in seesaw trading, with prices depressed by profit taking and dealers' squaring their positions ahead of the Easter weekend.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 75.09 points, or nearly four-tenths of a percent, to 19,892.18, with an estimated 750 million shares traded.
Exchanges in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore were closed for Good Friday. In Taiwan, stocks closed lower.
 
Gold and Oil
 Gold was quoted at a bid of $337.20 an ounce in late Tokyo trading on Friday, against $337 in New York late on Thursday.
Brent crude oil for May delivery was at $18.80 a barrel in afternoon trading in Asia, compared with $20.22 overnight in New York.

HEADLINE: Japan's Export-Import Bank To Invest in a U.S. Coal Port

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 9

 BODY:
A week before Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's scheduled visit to Washington, Japan's Export-Import Bank has announced that for the first time it is investing in a project in an industrialized country -- the United States.
The bank, which until now has devoted most of its resources to helping debt-laden developing countries, announced that it was investing $12 million in a new coal export terminal to replace the current one in the Port of Los Angeles. The deal is scheduled to be signed in Los Angeles on Monday. 
 The deal involves an equity investment, not a loan, and accounts for 10 percent of the total of $120 million being contributed by American and Japanese companies and the Port of Los Angeles. The project will involve building a terminal that will handle nine million tons of coal a year for export, much of it to Japan. When it is ready, the present one will be closed.
 
Pointed Symbolism
 Export-Import Bank officials made it clear that the unusual investment was for both economic and political purposes, which only underscored the pointed symbolism behind the announcement. The officials said that it was the bank's first equity investment and that it was not part of a regular program, but a one-time transaction.
"We think extra Japanese savings should be used for the welfare and the revitalization of the world economy," said Yuichi Ezawa, executive director of the bank. "We hope to continue this kind of cooperation with the United States and perhaps other developed countries later."
The announcement appears to have been part of the preparation for Mr. Miyazawa's visit to the United States late next week. President Clinton and Administration officials have been tough in their criticism of Japan's trade practices and its huge trade surpluses.
Mr. Miyazawa is planning a series of what it is hoped will be impressive economic announcements to counter those criticisms and to demonstrate that Japan is sincere about reducing the surpluses.
 
Public Works Spending
 As has been reported, the Prime Minister is expected to bring a new program of as much as $115 billion in public works spending to stimulate the Japanese economy, which should increase imports from America and reduce the surplus.
In addition, he will reportedly bring a five-year, $120 billion recycling plan to redistribute some of Japan's surpluses to developing countries as official loans and foreign aid. Included in that reportedly will be several billion dollars in low-cost loans to the United States to support some of the public works projects President Clinton has proposed.
The Los Angeles project appears to fall into this latter category. It benefits a city that is still recovering from race riots and should improve American exports to Japan, at least of coal.
The Export-Import Bank said that Japan had been trying to diversify its sources for coal away from Australia, currently the source of 70 percent of its coal imports.
 
Loans to States Contemplated
 This is not the first time the Export-Import Bank has been used to try to improve Japan's image in the United States, along with economic cooperation.
Three years ago, for instance, the bank contemplated offering the sort of loans it gives to developing countries to three poor American states -- Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi -- for projects like industrial parks. The deals never happened, however, in part because of political resistance in the United States.
The bank also began a program to make loans to American companies to improve their ability to export products to Japan. Only one loan, $250,000 to an electronics company in Tampa, Fla., was approved, however. Bank officials have said they hope to revitalize the program by easing the conditions for the loans.

HEADLINE: Law School at Columbia Weighs Aid Program Cut

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Nine years after starting a loan-assistance program to help steer lawyers to low-paying public-interest jobs, Columbia Law School officials are considering cutting it back, saying it may be too generous in fiscally troubled times.
The move is causing a stir on campus and among graduates who say they were counting on the program when they made a commitment to public-interest law. 
 The program would not only affect incoming and current students but also graduates who are working in public-interest jobs and face the prospect of less help in meeting huge debts they incurred to attend the law school.
"To be honest with you, I wouldn't have gone to a school that cost as much as Columbia if I had known they were going to do this," said Melinda Dutton, a 1992 graduate who earns $29,400 a year as a lawyer with the South Brooklyn Legal Services Corporation and borrowed $75,000 to help pay for law school tuition.
Columbia officials, who insist their program is still generous compared with similar ones at Yale, Harvard and New York University law schools, say the reduction in the loan-assistance program is only one measure they must impose to balance the budget next year.
The school, with an operating budget of $25.9 million this year, has already reduced health and pension benefits for faculty and administrators and it is considering a tuition increase next year.
 
Most-Opposed Change
 But it is the proposed change in the loan-assistance program that is causing the most anguish among students, who say their ability to attend the school is in peril, and others like them will be discouraged from taking jobs in low-paying public-service law.
A law degree from Columbia can leave a graduate with loans totaling more than $80,000. Under the assistance program, if a graduate's debt is billed at, say, $1,200 a month, he or she would pay only $175 of that amount, and the program would pay the rest. If the program is scaled back, the monthly amount the graduate would pay could double to $350.
Officials said that without any changes, the program would cost the law school $746,000 next year, about a third more than the cost of the program this year.
"The program cost is getting out of hand, out of control," said Edward J. Moroni, associate dean for finance at the law school. "The number of people taking advantage of the program is greater than we expected, and their debt is growing faster than we had expected."
When the program began, only a handful of students participated. Today, about 30 students a year sign up for the loan-assistance program, Mr. Moroni said. There are 190 people in the program now.
The dean of the law school faculty, Lance Liebman, is expected to make the final decision on the changes proposed by a committee he appointed to study the matter.
He said yesterday that students who had complained about the proposed changes had "made very good arguments, and I'm reviewing this in light of our financial situation, and I'll make a decision in the next few weeks."
Officials say they are committed to the program because they understand that without it, many students saddled with big debts after they graduate might not be able to afford going into public service. Tuition at the law school is now $18,522 a year, a 7 percent increase from the year before. But the officials say they believe the changes are fair.
"Adjustments of precise annual formulas by a few percentage points reflect harsh economic realities, not diminished commitment," Mr. Liebman wrote to one graduate concerned about the changes.
 
Problems at Other Schools
 Columbia is not the only law school that offers such incentives for students headed to public-service careers, and it is not the only school facing fiscal problems, said Carl C. Monk, executive director of the Association of American Law Schools in Washington.
He said that the number of law school graduates going into public service now is much lower than it was during the 1970's, and law school students in general are incurring larger debts to help finance the cost of their education. To help, about 30 law schools throughout the country, both private and public, have set up some sort of loan-assistance program.
Under the current program at Columbia, a graduate who borrowed $60,000 could receive abort $40,000 toward his or her school loans, paid out over 10 years, as long as the graduate stayed in public-service work, as defined by a committee at the school. The graduate would still write checks to the Federal agency or bank that lent the money, but twice a year the law school would reimburse the graduate for part of what he or she paid. The amount is based on a complicated formula tied to the graduate's income.
Under the new program, graduates would be reimbursed for all but an amount equal to 6 percent of their annual income during their first year in the job market. But under the current program, they are reimbursed for all but 3 percent.
For Melinda Dutton, the change would mean she would have to pay $150 a month, double what she now pays. Another graduate, Julie A. Caskey, said she never expected that the program would change.
"They told us, 'If you take out these loans, you will have this program to help you pay for these loans, and you don't have to worry about it,' " said Ms. Caskey, who is $80,000 in debt from law school and works for a small labor-law firm whose clients are mostly union members. "Now we've accepted these jobs and foregone other opportunities that were more lucrative, and we can't go back and remake these decisions, but the university says they can change their program any time they want."
Like Ms. Caskey, Ms. Dutton said she intended from the start to go into public service law, and she shopped around for a university that offered the best incentives to help people with goals like hers.
"I knew I wasn't going to be one of the people making $80,000 a year when I graduated," she said. "I was very serious about comparison shopping when looking at law schools."
Ms. Dutton said that if the proposal is approved, she and many other graduates will feel betrayed.
"It's really terrifying, is what it is," she said. "I think I was naive when I was looking at law school. I thought, 'These are large, well-respected institutions. If they tell me that's the way it is, then that's the way it is.' "

HEADLINE: Clinton to Ask Renewal Of Trade 'Fast Track'

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
President Clinton will ask Congress to renew special authority to complete negotiations on a sweeping overhaul of the rules governing world trade, the White House announced today.
Trade talks among 108 countries are now in their seventh year but are snarled in a dispute with Europe over a phaseout of farm subsidies. 
 "The failure to complete the round has been a source of disappointment and frustration to the United States and many of our trading partners," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, in announcing the effort to get the talks moving again.
Under the legislation to be submitted, the talks would have to be wrapped up by Dec. 15, with Congress then given until April 15, 1994, to act on the completed agreement.
 
Authority Has Expired
 The previous "fast track" authority expired on March 2. "Fast track" means that Congress is given a deadline for considering trade agreements, and there would be limits on amending the agreements.
A similar fast-track procedure is in place for the free trade agreement planned by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
The global talks, under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, hold out the promise of creating as much as $200 billion in new global commerce a year.
But the talks, which began in Uruguay in 1986, have been deadlocked for the last three years, largely in a dispute between the United States and the 12-nation European Community, particularly France. Basically, the United States wants to eliminate more farm subsidies and to act more quickly than its European trading partners wish.
In Brussels, the European Community's Commissioner for External Economic Affairs, Sir Leon Brittan, called the move "excellent news for the Uruguay Round."
"The time allowed is sufficiently long for the remaining negotiations to take place, but sufficiently short for it to put the necessary pressure on all concerned," Sir Leon said in a statement.
 
Meeting Is Scheduled
 Sir Leon is expected to meet on April 19 with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, in an effort to get the talks moving.
"A successful round would lower tariffs around the world and establish new multilateral rules for world trade," Ms. Myers said at a White House briefing.
"President Clinton and Ambassador Kantor have spoken with leaders from the E.C., Japan and other nations and emphasized our strong desire to complete an ambitious Uruguay Round this year," she said.
In November, the Bush Administration reached a tentative agreement with the European Community on easing farm subsidies. But France has threatened to veto that agreement.

HEADLINE: HOW THEY DO IT;
A Refinanced Mortgage: Long-Term Interest Savings Offset Short-Term Pain

 BODY:
Last winter, when interest rates fell below 8 percent, William and Gabriela Aynat of Milford, Conn., agreed it was time to refinance their mortgage. A $100,000 loan would cover the $91,000 balance on the original mortgage, and provide extra cash for home improvements. They found a bank offering a 15-year, fixed-rate loan at 7.75 percent, and set a date for an appraisal fo the house. The appraisal was a shock: The house was worth $21,000 less than the $121,000 the Aynats paid for it in 1986. Because their mortgage balance was now 90 percent of the market value of the house, the Aynats would need mortgage insurance, even for a loan of $90,000. And their new monthly payment of about $1,100, which includes mortgage insurance, would be nearly identical to their old one. Even so, the Aynats decided to refinance. Here's how the new loan will save them about $100,000 in the long run.

HEADLINE: Real Earnings Hold Steady

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
The average weekly earnings of United States workers, after adjusting for inflation, were essentially unchanged in March after falling four-tenths of 1 percent in February, the Labor Department said today.
The department originally reported that February real earnings fell two-tenths of 1 percent. The March change in real earnings was less than five-hundredths of 1 percent, it said, without giving a specific figure. 
 Average hourly earnings rose five-tenths of a percent in March, but that was offset by a drop of three-tenths of a percent in average weekly hours and an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in consumer prices for urban wage earners.
March real earnings were 1 percent lower than year-earlier levels, the department said.
In current dollars, weekly earnings of nonsupervisory private workers outside the farm sector averaged $370.44 last month, compared with $369.80 in February and $363.98 in March 1992.
In constant 1982 dollars, weekly earnings averaged $254.07 in March, compared with $254.16 in February and $257.23 in March 1992.

HEADLINE: Clinton Medical Plan Calls For 'Health Security' Cards

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
Under President Clinton's health plan, the Government would issue "health security cards" to all Americans certifying their right to medical care, Administration officials said today.
The card would be a tangible symbol of a person's enrollment in a new universal health insurance program, just as a Social Security card shows that a person has a lifetime account used to calculate Social Security benefits. 
 Three Administration officials involved in health policy, speaking on condition of anonymity at a White House briefing, began their effort to sell the President's plan by emphasizing what they believe will be its most popular features.
"Regardless of whether you lose your job, move, change your job or have a pre-existing medical condition, you'll keep that card," an official said. Insurance plans will have to take anyone presenting such a card, he said.
 
Concern Over Privacy
 The officials did not say how they would prevent fraudulent use of the cards or how they would protect the privacy of patients and their medical records. Members of Congress have expressed concern about such questions in the past.
The officials sought to dispel concern that Mr. Clinton wants to force everybody to join a health maintenance organization, or H.M.O. The officials insisted that people could choose their own doctors and continue customary arrangements under which patients pay a separate fee for each service.
An H.M.O., by contrast, provides a wide range of services in return for a fixed monthly premium. The premium does not vary with the amount of care.
In addition, the officials said, consumers will have access to some sort of "report card" evaluating the quality of care of various health plans. In this way, they said, people can learn how many complaints have been filed against a particular group of doctors and hospitals. The Administration officials reported on the work of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, coordinated by Ira C. Magaziner, a senior adviser to President Clinton.
 
20 Taxes Considered
 The officials refused to say how Mr. Clinton would pay for his plan, estimated to cost $30 billion to $90 billion a year. One official said the White House was considering a list of 20 taxes and other ways of raising money.
"You name it, we've got it on the table," he said. When asked about the idea of a Federal sales tax, or value-added tax, another official said, "Nothing is off the table."
The officials abandoned the terminology they had been using to describe the President's plan. For months, officials had said that millions of consumers would band together in "health insurance purchasing cooperatives" to buy coverage. The purchasing groups will now be called "health alliances."
Likewise, Clinton Administration officials today scorned the term "managed competition," on the ground that it refers to an academic theory. Their scorn is remarkable because health policy analysts who popularized the term, like Walter A. Zelman, a California insurance official, are now working at the White House.
One White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "You may call it managed competition, but we call it an American system that works for every state."
The officials also made these points:
*Under Mr. Clinton's plan, consumers would have a right to change health plans, probably once a year.
*Insurers could not reject consumers because of prior illness or other medical problems. Nor could they charge higher premiums to people who were sick. The Administration has not decided whether to allow companies to charge different rates for people of different ages.
*State officials would define the boundaries of each health insurance purchasing group. They would decide whether to have one such group or several in the state.
An Administration official said it would take "some number of years" to carry out Mr. Clinton's commitment to provide coverage for the 37 million Americans with no health insurance.
"This is a major change we're envisioning for one-seventh of the economy," the official said. "You can't turn that on a dime, even if you want to."
Dr. Mark R. Chassin, the New York State Health Commissioner, expressed impatience with the Administration.
"Managed competition poses some real risks that have not been adequately discussed, particularly with respect to quality," Dr. Chassin said today in an interview. "We have missed the coequal goal of health-care reform: assured quality to go along with universal access and affordable cost."
Under Mr. Clinton's plan, the Government would set a national limit on all health spending, public and private, as well as a health budget for each state. But Dr. Chassin said: "If you established a global budget for health-care expenditures in New York State, I wouldn't have any clue how to administer it. I don't think we have sufficient mechanisms. We have no control over spending for private physician services."
Clinton Administration officials confirmed that Medicaid, the Federal-state program for low-income people, would eventually end under the President's plan. Poor people would ultimately get private health insurance coverage through the same purchasing alliances as other people, with help from Government subsidies.
On Thursday, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said: "We expect to fold the Medicaid budget into health-care reform. So at the end of health-care reform, one should anticipate that there will not be something called Medicaid as such."
Governors have repeatedly complained that Congress was imposing costly new Medicaid requirements on the states. Noting such complaints, a Clinton Administration official said today, "The death of a program that people are unhappy with is to be applauded."

HEADLINE: LAW;
Patents and Copyrights: Do It Yourself and Save

BYLINE: By Laura Mansnerus

 BODY:
An economic crunch apparently makes people more defensive about protecting their property, including words, names and inventions. Patents, copyrights and trademarks, known collectively as intellectual property, have become a growing business for lawyers.
The work comes from corporations, kitchen-table inventors and entrepreneurs naming new businesses, and on the copyright side, from artists, developers of software programs and people who write just about anything. All aim to file applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the Copyright Office. 
 But much of the work can be accomplished without a lawyer, said David Pressman, a San Francisco lawyer and author of "Patent It Yourself" (Nolo Press, 1992). The patent and copyright offices assist applicants, and self-help books can guide the motivated. At the least, consumers who do their homework can monitor their lawyers -- "no trivial consideration," in Mr. Pressman's view.
With plenty of business, the lawyers themselves sometimes urge clients to do much of the work -- which would cost at least $150 an hour.
"There's a lot you can do to help your attorney," said Eric Marzluf, a partner in the Philadelphia law firm of Caesar, Rivise, Bernstein, Cohen & Pokotilow.
Patents, which cover new products, manufacturing processes and designs, are the trickiest and costliest of intellectual property rights.
The patent office advises applicants to retain a lawyer. So does the Intellectual Property Owners Association, a lobbying organization in Washington. "The lawyer has tried to foresee knockoffs," said the group's executive director, Herbert C. Wamsley. "Also, patent and trademark office procedures are complicated."
But Mr. Pressman maintains that anyone who can write a detailed description and follow directions can complete an application, whether for a potato peeler or a genetically altered microorganism. As to whether to hire a lawyer, which he estimated would cost $3,000 to $6,000 for the simplest patent application. Mr. Pressman said, "It's a balance of money, competence and time."
Applications can also be handled by patent agents, nonlawyers with technical training who, like lawyers, must register with the Patent and Trademark Office.
Copyright registration is comparatively simple, requiring a short application and a $20 fee. Registration is not even necessary to establish a copyright, which is actually created the moment words are set to paper, but registration can make it easier to prove authorship in court.
A simple, single-author registration can be done without a lawyer, although most will handle it for a modest fee. Mr. Marzluf, for example, says his firm charges about $300.
One of Mr. Marzluf's artist clients, Frank Bender, sought legal help when several museums expressed interest in his model of a proposed memorial to Holocaust victims. In 30 years as a photographer and sculptor, he had never before considered registering a copyright. "But I wanted to make sure no one could take this one away from me," Mr. Bender said.
He filled out the application, wrote descriptions of the sculpture and gathered slides and photocopies. Mr. Marzluf reviewed the paperwork.
On the complexity scale, trademarks fall between patents and copyrights. As with a patent, registering a business name or logo requires a search for any that look similar; this can be done on computer data bases by the applicant, though a lawyer may do it more efficiently. As with a copyright, the application is simple.
Kate McGrath, author of "Trademark: How to Name a Business and Product" (Nolo Press, 1992), generally advises people to pursue their own applications unless and until they find a conflict with an existing trademark.
Lawyers' fees for a trademark begin at about $1,000, including the filing fee, Ms. McGrath said. For a patent or trademark search, an individual or small business can also go directly to the same services that law firms use. Some of them "can be a real deal," Ms. McGrath said, although they cannot give any legal advice.
Lawyer or no, she said, it pays to anticipate trademark conflicts. Compared with the cost of litigation, the initial expenditure looks cheap.

HEADLINE: Another Barely Balanced Budget

 BODY:
"New York State is on the way back," boasts Gov. Mario Cuomo in a confident commentary on the new state budget. But back to what? Negotiating in secret, he and the leaders of the Legislature patched together another year of precariously balanced books, but no long-term solution for the state's fiscal squeeze.
The new budget includes substantial pluses, notably a nudge in the right direction for urban school aid, a critical commitment to long-term planning for mass transit, and state funding to freeze New York City bus and subway fares at $1.25 for at least two years. 
 But the budget also relies too heavily on uncertain revenues, borrowed billions and yet another trick sale of state property; this time, the state will "sell" roads to the Thruway Authority.
The Governor and the Legislature might still be haggling were it not for a late calculation that tax collections will be $800 million higher than had been forecast. It was no stretch for the Governor and the Legislature to find ways to spend the extra money. But that just means they will face a tighter squeeze next year when the windfall doesn't repeat itself.
The only real boost in revenue this year will come from a 17-cent increase in the tax on a pack of cigarettes, making New York's tax the highest in the nation. That's a ten-strike for health, but little gain for fiscal prudence. Cigarette taxes, after their first year, yield less and less instead of the more and more that New York will need to wipe out its structural deficit.
Revenue from the sale of roads to the Thruway Authority just prolongs Albany's addiction to back-door financing. Unable to win voter approval for new state bond issues, the Governor and the Legislature have now authorized billions more in Thruway borrowing -- at higher interest rates than the state would pay. And on the very same weekend, they approved a proposal to ban such fiscal folderol forever, by constitutional amendment. They legislate with forked tongue.
New York State still has the worst credit rating of all 50 states. New York State's budget process is still the most secretive. New York State is on the way back, the Governor says. When?

HEADLINE: South Korea Steps Forth

 BODY:
South Koreans have a lot more to think about this spring than North Korea's defiance of the world over nuclear inspections. Their own new President, Kim Young Sam, has set a stunning course of democratic reform that could, in the long run, prove far more significant than the shenanigans of the faltering Communist regime.
Mr. Kim, the first civilian democrat elected to Korea's presidency in more than 30 years, had a lifelong reputation as a moderate reformer. But in his first six weeks in office, he has moved boldly. He has brought talented newcomers into his Cabinet, forced corrupt politicians out of office with tough new financial disclosure rules and reaffirmed civilian political supremacy over the armed forces. 
 By American standards, Korea's present economic growth rate, in excess of 4 percent, looks healthy enough. But that's only half the pace of a few years ago, and Mr. Kim realistically aims much higher. The trick is to complete the transition from a low-wage economy with limited competition to a more open one with higher productivity.
Beyond the delicate problem of coaxing North Korea back into nuclear compliance, so far handled by Seoul with subtlety and skill, Mr. Kim faces the challenge of redefining Korea's place in an East Asia no longer shaped by the cold war and massive forward deployment of United States military forces.
Korea is ideally placed to become America's closest partner in this dynamic region. Its rapid economic development, and now equally rapid political strides, have made it one of modern Asia's greatest success stories. And unlike, say, Japan or China, South Korea has never given any nation cause to fear its regional ambitions.
Americans, who stood by South Korea through decades of cold war peril, can feel proud of their ally's growing success. Koreans can feel prouder still.

HEADLINE: The Versatile City That Film Makers Like to Film

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 9

 BODY:
To those who make movies, this city, like Hollywood itself, is a chameleon that can be Anywhere, U.S.A. For that matter, it can be Anywhere, period.
Film makers have found the physical landscape to be highly adaptable. The corner of Lansdowne and Dundas Streets, with a few camels, donkeys and sheep became an impressionistic Tangier in "Naked Lunch." The sprawling Kensington Market doubled as Teheran's souk in a potboiler called "Escape From Iran: The Canadian Caper." Other neighborhoods have posed as parts of London, Paris, Budapest and Beijing, as well as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and, of course, New York City. 
 The Brooklyn cheese store for which Cher did some of the accounts in "Moonstruck" is actually Il Centro del Fromaggio on St. Clair Avenue West. (The shop's owner, Francesco Celebre, says he's seen the movie "10 or 12 times.") In "Used People," the Manhattan street where Marcello Mastroianni and Shirley MacLaine were married is Toronto's Gerard Street. And in "Married to It," Casa Loma, the 98-room stone mansion built by an eccentric financier 80 years ago on a hilltop overlooking downtown, substitutes for Gracie Mansion, the New York mayoral residence. One of the bit actors is the former Mayor Edward I. Koch.
"This city is general enough to capture Cleveland easily, New York quite easily and a little bit of Chicago," said Alastair Reid, the British-born director of a new HBO film "Teamster Boss: The Jackie Presser Story," In it, Toronto stands in for all of those cities.
Toronto's mix of architectural styles as well as its ethnic diversity, its significant population of actors and a relatively untroubled union environment have all contributed to making it the third-ranking North American city in film production, behind Los Angeles and New York.
But the biggest advantage is a cheaper Canadian dollar. David Plant, Toronto's acting film liaison officer, said that at the present exchange rate, by which about 80 United States cents buys one Canadian dollar, it is about 30 percent cheaper to shoot here than in comparable locations in the United States.
Some American producers think that percentage may be on the high side. But there is no doubt that there are significant economies, not just from a favorable exchange rate but also from the reimbursement to foreign companies of indirect taxes like the federal Goods and Services Tax and the Ontario sales tax, which together add as much as 15 percent to the cost of just about everything.
John Kemeny, who produced "Teamster Boss: The Jackie Presser Story," estimated that shooting in Toronto rather than in the United States saved at least $200,000 in the $5 million movie.
American television companies also rely heavily on Toronto. Twenty-seven series did filming in Toronto last year. They include "Top Cops" (CBS), "Kung Fu" (Warner Brothers Television), "Secret Service" (NBC) and "Class of '96" (Fox Television). Mr. Plant said that the networks form partnerships with Toronto-based entrepreneurs, who obtain local financing and package deals in ways that yield tax advantages.
 
Millions to the Local Economy
 Last year was Toronto's best ever for film production. The city's Film Liaison Office issued permits for 88 productions that required 2,000 location shootings and pumped $ C305 million (about $244 million) into the city in performers' and technicians' pay, rental fees, hotel and restaurant charges and other revenue. The previous high was $ C289 million (about $231 million) in 1989.
Unlike New York, where so many Toronto-made films are set and which is still feeling the wounds of a bitter 1991 boycott by the major studios, this city offers compliant unions. In New York, relations between producers and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees have long been been prickly. In Toronto, Iatse is only one of three competing unions, each eager to make a deal.
"Like everyone else, we look at a basic contract and try to accommodate particular needs and deal with any obstacles," said Jamie Wood, the business agent of Iatse Local 873. "Sometimes problems come up that a contract couldn't have foreseen, so we look at the spirit of the original contract and do our best to come to a mutual agreement."
Even Sidney Lumet, a film maker who is identified with New York City as much as Woody Allen is, shot his most recent movie, a New York thriller called "Beyond Innocence," in Toronto last fall.
Competition is keen among cities, states and even countries for film productions, which pump billions of dollars into local economies. The Association of Film Commissions, the international professional association for government film offices, counts 275 members, representing major American cities, European countries and even the republics of the former Soviet Union.
To make certain it keeps pace, the Ontario government has just announced a $28.6 million subsidy for its film industry, and last summer Toronto opened an office in Hollywood. The city appointed a former movie public relations agent, Alison Emilio, to run it. Her job, said The Toronto Star, is "to schmooze, to go to all the right parties, meet all the right people."
Among the qualities that Ms. Emilio tries to sell to film producers are Toronto's talent pool (the city, says its publicity machine, has 10,000 actors and extensive technical support) and its multicultural character. According to one Unesco survey, Toronto is the most ethnically diverse city in the world. By one count, more than 140 languages are spoken here, and existing almost back to back are any number of ethnic neighborhoods, with names like Corso Italia, Ukrainian Bloorwest Village, Little Poland, Downtown Chinatown (the oldest of several Chinese neighborhoods in the greater Toronto area), Greektown and Koreatown.
Also helping make it one of the most photographed but unrecognized cities are its widely diverse architectural styles, which range from steel-and-glass skyscrapers to Victorian and Georgian homes, neo-Gothic churches, Greek Revival post offices, Beaux-Arts bank buildings and even a block of Italianate warehouses.
David Cronenberg, the Toronto-born director of "Naked Lunch," recently finished filming a movie version of "M. Butterfly." The movie, based on David Henry Hwang's play about a French diplomat who falls in love with a Chinese opera star, is an international story and was shot in various locations, including Beijing, Budapest, Paris -- and Toronto.
"I found I could intermix the shooting," Mr. Cronenberg said, "finding a little Budapest, some French and some Chinese things, all in Toronto."
For all the benefits derived from the film-production industry, there is an inevitably rueful edge to a city that must always pretend to be somewhere else. Toronto is still waiting to be the star of its own movie.

HEADLINE: May Justice Come to Overcut National Forests

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For more than 30 years the board feet of Federal timber cut each year has improvidently and illegally exceeded the amount grown. 
 In the Willamette National Forest in Oregon, the largest of the Federal forests, in the years 1990-92, timber cut was 18 percent greater than the timber sold. In that forest and other federally owned forests this has been the rule, not the exception, for years.
It's no wonder we have a "crisis" that requires that the Federal forests sell no more timber, except for ecological reasons, until the forests are restored to the sustained-yield basis long mandated by Federal statute.
Out here in the Pacific Northwest Federal forest managers in Region 6 (Oregon and Washington) permitted 10 percent more timber to be cut than was grown in 1952, a percentage that went up to 57 percent in 1987, 25 years later. No one seems to know what the accumulated debt is in board feet, but it has to be staggering.
That the Federal forest is required to grow every year an amount of board feet at least equal to what was cut was in effect long before the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960 and before the Federal Land Management Act of 1976, which also required maintaining an even volume of board feet in our publicly owned forests.
Although the Renewable Resource Assessment Act charges the Secretary of Agriculture to prepare a report based on information supplied by the Forest Service and other Federal agencies and on present and anticipated uses of America's renewable resources of the forest, range and other associated lands, those reports, if they exist, are elusive.
The first such report was to be ready by Dec. 31, 1975, then updated in 1979 and each 10th year thereafter. As far as I can determine, the reports were never made or, if they were, they were filed and forgotten.
The problem is not in the laws, but rather in the consciences of Federal forest managers and Department of Justice attorneys.
They turned their backs on the gross overcutting of our Federal forests, a disgraceful state of affairs that President Clinton is remedying.
Now the Clinton Administration can identify and prosecute those responsible for this brazenly corrupt pandering to the politically savvy timber moguls, who on cue shed crocodile tears for unemployed loggers while they are castigating environmentalists for the Federal forest timber shortage that they themselves have caused.

HEADLINE: Representative Is Acquitted In Fraud and Bribery Case

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, April 9

 BODY:
A Federal District Court jury acquitted Representative Harold E. Ford of 18 fraud and conspiracy charges today, ending a long, racially charged legal process.
Mr. Ford, 47 years old, Tennessee's only black member of Congress and head of a powerful political dynasty, was acquitted by a jury of 11 whites and 1 black on charges of accepting bribes disguised as $1.5 million in loans. The trial had prompted fears a conviction could result in violence. The jury also returned not-guilty verdicts against Mr. Ford's two white co-defendants, Karl Schledwitz, 41, and Douglas Beaty, 44, who are both lawyers accused of helping to make the money look like legitimate loans. 
 Before the trail began, Mr. Ford bitterly protested the court's decision to select jurors from largely white and rural Jackson, Tenn., 80 miles east of here. A trial on the same charges ended in a hung jury in 1990 after jurors deadlocked along racial lines.
After the verdict was read, Mr. Ford rose and bowed toward the jurors and said, "I'd just like to thank the jurors very much." Later he called for an end to the racial tensions the trial intensified and again thanked the jurors for the verdict before heading out to a celebration.
 
Time of Healing Urged
 "I call upon all citizens of Memphis now to -- let's go through a process of healing in this city," he told supporters who packed his Congressional office. "We've had 10 years of division."
Judge Jerome Turner of Federal District Court, who rebuffed efforts by Mr. Ford and the Justice Department to throw out the jury and select a new one from the Memphis area, which is almost half black, delivered a stinging rebuke to some of Mr. Ford's supporters, who had threatened economic reprisals because of the trial.
"I was astounded at the willingness of some people to cripple this city and its economic welfare," he said from the bench after the jury returned its verdict. "Our justice system works. Black people and white people can judge each other fairly if just given a chance."
At his celebration, Mr. Ford fired back at the judge, accusing him of presiding over a biased trial. "I have no respect for Judge Turner," he said. "I may call him up and tell him that."
As recently as last weekend during activities commemorating the 25th anniversary of the assassination here of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Ford had likened Judge Turner to the late Mayor Henry Loeb, whose intransigence in a Memphis sanitation worker's strike had been a factor in the events that preceded Dr. King's death.
At a news conference this afternoon, Mayor Willie H. Herenton of Memphis confirmed that "extensive and comprehensive" security measures had been planned in the event of possible disturbances after the trial. "I am extremely elated that Congressman Ford and his co-defendants have been exonerated," he said. "This goes to show that justice can prevail." He is the city's first black mayor.
Jurors deliberated for 15 hours before reaching the verdict.
The trial turned largely on dry, complicated financial transactions that the prosecutor said constituted almost $1.5 million in political payoffs. The defense lawyers contended that they were loans Mr. Ford intended to pay off.
But the often technical and abstruse financial aspects of the case were overshadowed by emotionally charged legal, political and racial issues. Mr. Ford, a popular and powerful figure who served as a Representative from Memphis for 18 years, has said from the start of the 10-year-old case that the prosecution was the result of bias.
The selection of out-of-town jurors was mandated last year by the former presiding judge, Odell Horton, who declared the 1990 mistrial because of inflamed local publicity and the deadlocked jury. In his first trial, the jury selected in Memphis consisted of eight blacks and four whites.
The move by the Justice Department elicited criticism that it had injected politics into the legal system and prompted Ed Bryant, the United States Attorney for the western district of Tennessee, to quit in protest.
In the end, Federal Judge Jerome Turner ruled against Mr. Ford and the Justice Department, denying the motion to select a new jury, and criticized the Justice Department for caving in to political pressures.
In a decision that spoke to an issue raised more and more often throughout the country, the judge said a defendant does not have the right to be tried by jurors of his own race.
"If we are truly to become one nation, to be integrated in a society where the laws are color-blind and all men are equal under the law, then we cannot allow the demands of racially fixed juries to invade our jury system of random selection," he wrote. "It is a sad day, in my view, when the acting Attorney General and a representative of the White House give in to a demand that a jury of the United States must be selected by race."
Mr. Ford's supporters argued that moving the trial to Jackson County had the same effect, by guaranteeing an overwhelmingly white panel.
The key issue in the trial was whether the money Mr. Ford accepted from two Knoxville bankers, Jacob F. Butcher and C. H. Butcher Jr., from 1976 through 1982 were bogus loans.
In his closing argument on Tuesday, Dan Clancy, the chief prosecutor, asked the jurors to disregard personalities and stick to the facts. If they did, he said, common sense would tell them that Mr. Ford had received in payoffs disguised as loans from the Butchers.
William McDaniels, Mr. Ford's lead lawyer, asked the jurors for "a healing verdict for Memphis." And he said the testimony had demolished the prosecution's contention that the loans were payoffs for political favors.

Elegant Retailer Tries Delaying Extinction

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
"What about a museum?" a saleswoman in handbags suggests, gesturing inside the historic Art Deco-style I. Magnin department store on Wilshire Boulevard, which closed last month -- one of six to be shut by the bankrupt retailer R. H. Macy & Company by the end of the year. "Can't you see a brontosaurus here?" she asked.
Some retail industry executives think the metaphor is particularly apt for money-losing I. Magnin, the venerable, San Francisco-based retailer known for high-priced, sophisticated fashions and an elegant ambiance. 
 In what is considered a last-ditch effort to save the specialty chain, Macy and I. Magnin's new chairman, Joseph Cicio, are paring its size to 12 stores and trying to broaden its clientele by offering merchandise that reflects a West Coast style. Of the remaining stores, only one is outside California -- in Phoenix.
 
'A Name of Magic'
 Industry executives and analysts say debt-laden Macy had little choice but to stanch the hemorrhaging from I. Magnin, which has not turned a profit since it was acquired from Federated Department Stores in 1988 as part of the $1.1 billion takeover of Bullock's. But they are skeptical that the retailer's declining fortunes can be reversed while California remains in recession and unemployment stands above 9 percent.
"I. Magnin is a name of magic in California," said Kurt Barnard of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. "Unfortunately, the magic name has lost its adherents. They must carve out a new customer base."
Macy, however, is giving Mr. Cicio only a year to turn an operating profit. If not, "then we have to make a tough decision," said Myron E. Ullman 3d, Macy's co-chairman. Analysts say the depressed market for retail properties, particularly these kinds of chains, has kept Macy from selling I. Magnin.
I. Magnin's cachet, which proved a measure of protection under previous owners, "isn't enough of a reason to run a business that doesn't work," Mr. Ullman said.
 
Once Had 31 Stores
 The plan to reorient I. Magnin, announced by Macy last month, will save the chain a reported $10 million by closing six stores. That would leave a chain with revenue of $275 million, down from a peak of 31 sites in five states in 1990 and revenue of $440 million.
And after decades of catering to affluent and older customers, those who can afford the $800 Valentino shirts, I. Magnin is trying to broaden its appeal with an advertising and remerchandising effort begun last month called "new attitude." It aims to draw a younger crowd by stocking contemporary designer sportswear priced under $500 for an ensemble.
"I'd always thought it projected too mature, an intimidating feeling of too expensive," said Mr. Cicio, who has been with Macy 16 years and is known for his merchandise displays and store design. "I want that perception to change."
The campaign's unlikely cornerstone is the Edge, which opened earlier last month after a $300,000 remodeling of the sixth floor at I. Magnin's Union Square flagship store in San Francisco. It features hip fashions from a dozen designers new to I. Magnin, like Claude Montana.
Instead of the hushed, aristocratic fine-apparel salons on the lower floors, the sixth floor has a nightclub's energy but the look of a boutique. The music is hip-hop. An espresso bar beckons. So do hand- painted jeans, recycled-paper stationery, natural cosmetics and platform shoes. A floor remake at the Beverly Hills branch is next.
 
Inconspicuous Consumption
 Larger competitors like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue have grabbed market share by stocking a higher percentage of lower priced, private-label goods that appeal to career women.
I. Magnin was founded in 1876 by Mary Ann Magnin and named for her husband, Isaac. In 1944, it became part of Bullock's, which had its own high-end unit, Bullocks-Wilshire, and all were acquired by Federated in 1964. Macy's changed the three Bullocks-Wilshire stores to I. Magnin stores.
I. Magnin misspent its strength as an urban, fashion leader in poorly planned suburban and out-of-state sites. And its core customers, who still spend more on Chanel than on any other label, have begun a shift to more affordable stores.
"The market isn't supporting the extremes it used to," said Walter Levy, a retail consultant. "There's social pressure against conspicuous consumption."
Industrywide, Mr. Ullman said the specialty store segment remains viable, if sales average $300 a square foot. (Industry leader Nordstrom rings up $388 a square foot.) After the latest round of store closings, I. Magnin's sales per square foot will rise to $260 from $200.
 
Changing the Image

 
 Mr. Cicio, 47, was named chairman and chief executive in September after Rose Marie Bravo left to become president of Saks Fifth Avenue. Previously a senior vice president for fashion direction for Macy, Mr. Cicio moved fast to change I. Magnin's image.
Interiors are being brightened with fresh paint and more powerful lighting. Mr. Cicio would like to add more men's apparel, accessories and private labels. Arie L. Kopelman, president and chief operating officer of Chanel, is confident I. Magnin can woo contemporary customers without hurting its Chanel business. "It takes a real touch," he said. "It's a question of how to broaden it, without losing the luster on the high-end."
Yet Alan Millstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report, gave I. Magnin's repositioning little chance. "It's like trying to turn an ocean liner in a bathtub," he said. "They had attitude for years."

Power Unit Acts to Drop 2 A-Plants

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 9

 BODY:
The Washington Public Power Supply System said today that it would move to abandon two partly built nuclear plants on which it halted work 10 years ago rather than continue to spend $10.5 million a year on the paperwork needed to keep them alive.
The executive board of the power system has resolved "to investigate all the ramifications" of closing the two plants, an action that could occur by early 1994, said Carl M. Halvorson, chairman of the board. 
 He said the board had conveyed its intentions to Randall Hardy, administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration, the Federal power marketer that has guaranteed repayment of $4.6 billion in revenue bonds that were sold to finance the construction of the two plants, which were begun in the mid-1970's.
The $10.5 million a year needed to keep the plants alive is collected by Bonneville from more than 100 Pacific Northwest utility companies that have shares in the plants. The bottom-line payers of that cost are the utilities' customers.

 
No Power Produced
 One plant, Unit 1, is in Hanford, Wash., and is 75 percent completed; the other, Unit 3, in Satsop, Wash., is 65 percent finished. Neither has produced any power. The board will also study whether one of the units can be converted to a fossil-fuel plant.
Several utilities with shares in the plants have rebelled against paying for them. In March, the Snohomish County Public Utility District said it would not make further yearly payments of $1.8 million. And Clark Public Utilities said it would sue to force termination if the Washington Public Power Supply System boards did not act today.
The question of when to decommission the plants and restore their sites to farmland would have to be resolved. Costs could run to $150 million for each plant, but Unit 1 has only $100 million in cash remaining in a construction fund from the bond issue and Unit 3 has no cash. Unit 1 could sell its stored nuclear fuel, which was worth about $120 million five years ago but now is worth about $80 million because the price of uraminum has dropped.
 
Hydro Power Output Down
 Bonneville is trying to stave off a financial crisis of its own caused by a drought, which has reduced its hydroelectric output and power sales from Federal dams on the Columbia River.
Mr. Hardy said today that he was trying to hold a rate increase scheduled for Oct. 1 to below 20 percent -- a level that many industrial customers and utilities say would be a blow. He said Bonneville's reserves had plummeted by a quarter of a billion dollars in the last three months "and we've got to take extraordinary measures to deal with this."
Mr. Hardy said he believed the two unfinished nuclear plants were no longer cost competitive. If completed, at a cost of $3.4 billion, they would produce energy for 4 cents a kilowatt hour, he said, while power from gas-fired plants and cogeneration could be had for about 3 cents a kilowatt hour.
 
$2.25 Billion Default
 In the early 1980's, the power system had five nuclear power plants under construction. Only Unit 2 now operates commercially. In 1983, the agency defaulted on $2.25 billion in revenue bonds for Units 4 and 5 after it abandoned the two units, which were about 25 percent completed, because demand for power fell. It was the largest municipal bond default in the nation's history.
Construction on Units 1 and 3 was halted because further financing dried up.
Mr. Hardy does not expect a similar default on Units 1 and 3 because contracts among Bonneville, the power system and the utility participants are valid even if the plants are abandoned and never produce power.
He said he had promised Morgan Guaranty Trust of New York, the bond fund trustee for Unit 1, and the Seafirst Bank of Seattle, trustee for Unit 3, that he would ask the Federal courts to rule on the plan's validity before assets were sold. That will take about nine months.

Women: Swap 'Em Or Sell 'Em

BYLINE: By Caryn James

 BODY:
Mom always said that it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as a poor man. "Indecent Proposal" proves that it's easier. To reveal the film's premise gives away nothing important. Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson are Diana and David Murphy, a married couple passionately in love and seriously in debt, who go to Las Vegas to try to beat the odds. There, a billionaire named John Gage offers them a million dollars for one night with the wife.
It says everything about the film, though, that Gage is played by Robert Redford. Here is Diana torn between one of America's genuine sex symbols, looking better than he has in years, and the bar guy from "Cheers," whose movie character behaves like a dweeb. What would you do?
The first thing the Murphys do, proving they are true children of the 80's, is call in their lawyer (the superbly unctuous Oliver Platt) to draw up a contract. He provides the story's one touch of humor and goes to the heart of the film's complexity when he says, "For a million bucks I'd sleep with him. It's not like it's hard duty or anything. He's a great-looking guy." 
 Lines like this make "Indecent Proposal" the most adult and intriguing of the recent films in which women are objects to be bought, sold and used to pay off gambling debts. "Honeymoon in Vegas" and "Mad Dog and Glory" engage in verbal acrobatics and labyrinthine plot twists to justify this antediluvian attitude and get on with their comic stories.
The grown-up "Indecent Proposal" is front and center about the nexis of money, power and sex (which no one, let's face it, has ever figured out). When Diana says, "You can't to buy people," the megabucks businessman Gage replies with suave certainty: "That's a bit naive, Diana. I buy people all the time." You can argue with him, but you'll have a hard case to make.
The casting, as much as the script, determines how effectively the film toys with viewers' reactions and defies simple responses. No offense to Mr. Harrelson, but his David is likely to have viewers resisting the obvious sympathies the triangular affair is designed to evoke. When the Murphys' Faustian bargain breaks the marriage apart, Diana pines over her unemployed architect, a man who puts his sneakers on the kitchen table (meant to be an endearingly annoying habit). While the film is coaxing viewers to remember that David is Diana's one true love, he comes off like a self-pitying nerd.
Meanwhile, the handsome billionaire, though manipulative to a fault, is turning on the charm for her and revealing his sensitive side in a mansion on his estate. He hasn't simply bought her; he loves her, too. This is the point at which Mom gets to say, "I told you so."
Imagine how different the film would have been if an actor with typical leading-man looks and a more dynamic screen presence -- someone like Peter Gallagher -- had played David. The attractiveness factor would have been neutralized. The only issue left would have been money, and the film would have been infinitely less provocative. It is impossible to say whether the director, Adrian Lyne (Mr. "Fatal Attraction" himself), intended to make David quite so unappealing. Intentional or not, the trick works.
At first gage seems merely condescending; he makes his million-dollar offer to David when Diana is standing right there. But this approach turns out to be one of Gage's more masterly power plays, allowing him to drive a wedge between the couple, who must share responsibility for the decision. It allows Gage to tell Diana later, "If you were mine, I wouldn't share you with anyone." There is still the rankling sense that she is treated as her husband's property, but the choice and its consequences are evenly shared.
"Indecent Proposal" doesn't want viewers to be comfortable or complacent about this choice, though an easy conscience is precisely what the other women-as-object films aim for.
The recent "Honeymoon in Vegas" is a comic version of a similar story, with Sarah Jessica Parker agreeing to spend a platonic weekend with James Caan to pay off her fiance's $65,000 gambling debt. (The question of whether Demi Moore is worth that much more than Sarah Jessica Parker is a whole other story.) The film is so smart and funny that you would have to be humorless to take the deal seriously in this Vegas filled with Elvis impersonators.
"Mad Dog and Glory" has to work harder to justify itself and glides too easily past its disturbing premise. Uma Thurman labors to convince the audience that it was her idea to work off her brother's gambling debt by giving herself to Bill Murray. She's selfless but not too bright. In both these films, the woman's nominal choice is contrived to allow viewers to sigh with relief, sit back and enjoy the movie.
There is even a man gambled away in a poker game in "Benny and Joon," opening on Friday. It is significant that he is a weak man, barely able to care for himself but with a genius for impersonating silent screen comedians. This mime savant has none of the power society confers on men.
While other films dance around the issue of buying and bartering people, "Indecent Proposal" embraces it. It isn't aways a good film; it employs lazy voice-overs to express sappy sentiments about the Murphys' eternal love. But it turns an inflammatory plot into a surprisingly honest and entertaining movie.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Vacancies Add to Westchester Glut

BYLINE: By MARY VIZARD

 BODY:
A RECENT announcement by I.B.M. that it would vacate 845,000 square feet of office space in two Westchester County buildings has sent the already beleaguered office market in the county reeling.
For one thing, it caused this year's first-quarter office vacancy rate to shoot up 4 points, to 26.4 percent, from three months ago, according to Rostenberg Doern, a Stamford, Conn., brokerage firm that specializes in commercial real estate. 
 The hardest hit area is downtown White Plains, with a record vacancy rate of 35.8 percent, up from 28.9 percent at the end of last year, according to Rostenberg Doern.
This was caused, in large part, by I.B.M.'s decision to vacate 373,000 square feet in Westchester One, the largest building in White Plains, where the company leases 820,540 square feet. And the company is likely to continue reducing its office space, according to an I.B.M. spokesman, Ken Sayers.
"Our strategy is to gradually move out of leased space as contracts expire and into I.B.M.-owned space," Mr. Sayers said. "Regrettably, the company finds it also needs less company-owned space."
As a result, I.B.M. has placed one of its premiere properties on the market: The 472,639-square-foot, I. M. Pei-designed building at 2000 Purchase Street. Employees will begin vacating the building in May and move to company-owned headquarters in Armonk and to a company-owned property in White Plains.
"Just by shutting the building down we can cut our costs by 50 percent," Mr. Sayers said.
The property was designed as a single-tenant building and will probably be bought by a major corporation.
"It's a true corporate building," said John Rostenberg, a principal at Rostenberg Doern. "Architecturally, I think it's the finest building in Westchester. It will take time and effort, but it will sell."
The Purchase building is now one of three buildings on the market with over 250,000 square feet. "Unfortunately, there are also fewer companies looking for that much space," said Michael Siegel, executive director of the Westchester/Fairfield office of the Edward S. Gordon Company, a real-estate brokerage firm.
I.B.M. now leases over 2 million square feet of office space in Westchester and owns an additional 3.5 million, according to Mr. Sayers. At one time, it occupied as much as 7 million square feet, which it began vacating in the late 1980's.
"Most of the space growth took place in the 1970's and the early 80's," said Michael Dailey, executive director for Cushman & Wakefield, which is marketing vacant space in Westchester One. "The company provided the underpinning for the growth and prosperity of the county, so naturally the negative effect is going to be equally as noteworthy."
I.B.M. is not the county's only problem. In the past, Westchester had been an attractive location for expanding companies from New York City, but that no longer seems to be so.
"In part, it's the economy, in that companies are no longer looking for a place to expand," Mr. Dailey said. "And maybe the ones that wanted to go have already gone. And some may have decided there's an advantage to being in New York City."
MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL was recently considering leaving Manhattan and moving to White Plains. But the company decided to stay put when the city offered it a $2 million tax incentive package.
In the last few years, Westchester has also lost companies to Connecticut, which has a variety of state incentive packages to help businesses expand or relocate.
Last year, the Purdue Frederick Company, an international pharmaceutical concern, announced plans to move its research and development division from Yonkers to a 156,000-square-foot building in Norwalk, Conn. Connecticut and Norwalk offered the company an incentive package worth more than $2 million, including $1 million in relocation costs.
In contrast, Westchester has no official incentive program. Yet it has developed a good record in retaining businesses.
Last year, 52 percent of all leasing activity was from intracounty relocations, according to the Gordon company. Some 33 percent was from company expansions in their current locations and the rest by companies from outside the county.
LAST year, when J.W.P., a multinational technology company based in Purchase, was offered $3 million to move to Connecticut, the county Office of Commerce and Economic Development contacted Alfred B. DelBello, former Lieutenant Governor and Westchester County Executive, who worked for a time as an unpaid "development czar" for the county.
When Mr. DelBello could find no state program that would induce the company to stay, he improvised a deal that involved a reduction in property taxes for an office building in Rye Brook and provided relocation assistance for the company's employees.
A similar deal was struck for TransAmerica Leasing Inc., which just signed a long-term lease for 120,000 square feet at a building owned by the Nestle Foods Corporation.
Some brokers are beginning to wonder if all the time and effort to keep companies would be better spent elsewhere.
Scott H. Benson, president of Benson Commercial Realty in Tarrytown, maintains that "continued lateral movement, which in most cases represents a decrease in gross absorption, continues to erode the marketplace."
He cites the case of TransAmerica, where the company's move from one building to another represented a total net absorption of less than 4,000 square feet.
At a recent talk before a group of real estate executives, Mr. DelBello called for an end to the "cannibalistic" regional competition for large companies. More effort should be expended, he said, in trying to attract and nurture small entrepreneurial companies that can grow in the county.
"Last year, 80 small companies moved into the county, and the same level should be reached this year," said Noreen Preston, an economic development specialist for the county.
As a result of the space glut, rents have been steadily decreasing, allowing small companies to expand in more prestigious locations. The Gordon company reports average rents at $19.61 a square foot, down from $20.21 three months ago.
TWO high-technology companies were recently able to relocate from tertiary to class A space. Securities Applications Inc., which develops computerized security systems, moved from Hawthorne to 4,000 square feet at the Summit of Westchester, in Mount Pleasant. And Reference Systems Inc., which provides integrated business, factory and office automation systems, left White Plains for 6,000 square feet at the Sutton Park Building, also in Mount Pleasant.
"We are witnessing an ever-increasing number of small to mid-size privately held firms taking advantage of the current soft market to upgrade their image," said Edward Stutz, director of commercial leasing for Benson Commercial Realty.
The vast majority of leasing deals in the county are for under 5,000 feet, said Mr. Siegel of the Gordon company, adding: "We're no longer seeing activity in large blocks of square footage."
To help companies grow, the county's development office ran a seminar for small business in January, offering technical assistance, financing and help with legal problems. "It was an incredible success," Ms. Preston said. "We had to turn people away."
Brokers are reporting other positive signs in the marketplace.
"Consolidations, like I.B.M.'s, are starting to abate," said Mr. Dailey of Cushman & Wakefield. "Lately there's been a groundswell of tenants asking for surveys so they can expand. I think we're going to see a turnaround. It might not happen soon. But the signs are out there that it will happen."

Forest Protection vs. Property Rights

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
TWO years ago a developer took an option on the Birch Lane Restaurant in New Hartford and 130 acres of timberland off Route 44. He planned to build a mixed residential-commercial complex, but, said the owner, Kenneth Kohner, "the deal fell through because of the poor economy."
Today, still unable to sell the property, Mr. Kohner has begun to harvest the trees. He is one of many woodlot owners, foresters and loggers in the state who make part or all of their living from trees. In the next year or two they will be faced with controversial new state regulations aimed at protecting landowners from unscrupulous loggers, protecting forests from decimation and preserving wildlife habitats. 
 "Previous to 1972 the forests had been increasing," said Donald H. Smith, acting forester for the state's Department of Environmental Protection in Hartford, "but in 1985 when the department conducted its last survey, 29,000 acres had been lost since 1972, when there were 1.8 million acres of forest, or 59 percent of the state.
"There has been little change since 1985 because development slacked off, but as the economy improves and pressure for development rises again we will see more forests disappearing."
In fact, the state's Department of Housing reported its first increase in building permits in six years when the number of authorized units jumped in February of this year by 93.9 percent, or 797 units, over January's 411. The two-month total of 1,208 units is 41.8 percent ahead of the 852 units in the similar period last year.
One set of proposals drafted by the D.E.P. is expected to go to public hearing within the next two months. It would require for the first time that foresters be certified and loggers licensed. More than 500 individuals and 200 companies would be affected, plus out-of-staters working in Connecticut.
A second set of regulations to be proposed next year would require a harvesting plan to be submitted by a landowner before any trees are felled. The plan would state the time of harvesting, volume, size of trees, method of restoring disturbed terrain and impact on wetlands and watercourses. The plan would have to be approved before a harvesting permit was issued.
The regulations are to implement the Forest Practices Act passed by the General Assembly in 1991, giving the D.E.P. the power to regulate forestry in the state. After public hearings, the regulations will go to the legislature for passage. One member of the public -- Mr. Kohner -- called the regulations "another law to infringe on private property rights."
"You should be able to do what you want with your property," he said.
Dick Hayes, the logger working on the Kohner land, is familiar with such regulations from working in other states. "Regulations don't bother me," he said.
But Mel Harder, a forestry consultant, believes the Forest Practices Act is unnecessary and will hurt the industry.
"A hundred years ago Connecticut was 80 percent farmland and as the farms disappeared the woodlands grew," he said. "In some areas the brass and steel companies chopped wood for charcoal. They clearcut, and the woods came back. Our forests are not at risk and we are not even close to harvesting what we should."
Mr. Smith said: "If you make a living as a logger or forester it's in your best interest to get the most and best trees. And if you're a woodlot owner faced with putting braces on your kid's teeth, or college costs, motivation to cut is overwhelming.
"Many innocent landowners are taken advantage of by loggers who clearcut unneccessarily, and owners make poor decisions based on a forester's recommendation. It doesn't bode well for the future. The overall quality and vigor of the forests will decline and the resource will be unable to support the demand."
Mr. Harder estimated that almost 90 percent of Connecticut's forests of oak, maple, birch, hickory, ash and evergreens are in private hands. Lots can range in size from five to 500 acres.
Foresters select the trees to be cut. Maturity -- usually no less than 14 inches in diameter -- value, volume appropriate to the desired density and environmental impact on wetlands and waterways are the main factors. They mark the trees for cutting and collect a commission on the sale.
Loggers do the actual cutting -- but in the absence of regulations frequently do the selecting as well.
SUITS brought by landowners against overzealous loggers who cut too much, or trespassed and harvested trees illegally, led some towns to enact laws. More than 30 of Connecticut's 169 municipalities have regulations largely based on environmental concerns. Glastonbury, for example, last year prevented a resident from harvesting trees until winter, when the rattlesnakes, an endangered species, hibernate. "Once the Forest Practices Act gets rolling," said John Rook, Glastonbury's planning specialist, "we hope to see regulations regarding endangered species."
"The D.E.P. maintains a data base of the state's endangered plants, animals, birds and habitats that could be useful," said Leslie N. Corey Jr., director of the Connecticut chapter of the Nature Conservancy in Middletown. "Plans for cutting trees could be run through that office."
While there are no old-growth forests in Connecticut like those that shelter the spotted owl in the Northwest, bald eagles have been reintroduced through two decades of conservation efforts, almost all on private, densely wooded property that the birds need. A nesting pair in a Barkhamsted forest is the first in 42 years.
A cooperative effort by eight towns to preserve the natural beauty of the Connecticut River is called the Connecticut Gateway Commission. Under its 1973 state charter, no cutting or other disturbance may occur on 25,000 acres along both riverbanks without the commission's permission.
For the last three months, Joseph Willis, owner of Nationwide Timberland Management Corporation in Ellington, has been advertising in four rural newspapers, resulting in 10 logging jobs. "People who bought land at high prices three to five years ago want to sell the property or the timber," he said. He has bought three tracts totaling 145 acres, harvested them and resold them.
He feels he must continue to advertise for the often difficult backwoods jobs because, he said, "all the drive-by wood is gone."

HEADLINE: Fighting the Odds, and the F.C.C., He Got His FM Station

BYLINE: By ROBERT G. WOLETZ

DATELINE: DUMONT

 BODY:
FOR 20 years, Gerard Turro harbored a dream of starting a round-the-clock commercial FM radio station to serve Bergen County. Last month, operating from the second story of an aging brick and cinder block building here, his station, WJUX-FM, took to the airwaves.
Reality has tempered the dream somewhat. What Mr. Turro, a 38-year-old radio engineer, still lacks is a commercial station. WJUX cannot accept advertising, though Mr. Turro has not given up on that, either. 
 The station, with its 24-hour mix of crooners and big-band music along with Bergen County news, traffic and weather, now brackets the radio dial, broadcasting on 88.7 from Franklin Lakes and on 103.1 from Fort Lee.
Mr. Turro recalls stumbling upon the latter frequency in 1973. "I had been poking around the radio on the Craig eight-track in my car when I noticed an empty spot around 103 on the dial," he said.
That led him to read up on Federal Communications Commission license procedure. He learned that 103 was among those dial locations the agency had set aside as a buffer between station signals to prevent interference. The frequency was restricted to "translating" or repeating other existing FM stations in reception areas where their signals are weak. A license to operate a "repeater" station, Mr. Turro reasoned, might be the key that would unlock his dream.
In 1985, Mr. Turro, an Oradell resident who was by then a contract radio engineer for several stations in the New York area, applied for and was granted such a license. But converting it to a full-fledged radio station would not come without a fight.
 
Outmaneuvering Opponents
 For eight years Mr. Turro fought what often seemed a quixotic battle against the F.C.C. and the National Association of Broadcasters, among others. Blocked from converting his repeater station, he outmanuevered his opponents instead, obtaining with a personal investment he estimates at $100,000 what some observers think may be a small but potentially valuable piece of the nation's largest radio market.
Repeater stations may not broadcast original programming. But not long after he established his low-power FM repeater in Fort Lee, Mr. Turro petitioned the F.C.C. for the right to broadcast his own programming from the tower. His argument: no existing FM stations were meeting the information needs of a major part of Bergen County.
Alpine, in Bergen County, had been the site of the nation's first experimental FM radio station in 1939, a time when AM radio was America's dominant broadcast medium. But the F.C.C. has never granted Bergen its own full-time commercial FM-dial allocation; listeners rely on stations in New York and other New Jersey counties for their community news.
"Bergen County has never truly been served by the New York radio stations," said Assemblywoman Charlotte Vandervalk, Republican of Montvale, who had intervened with the F.C.C. on Mr. Turro's behalf.
 
News About Disasters
 "The only time they focus on county news is when there is a major disaster," she said. "Even then, they tend to report on the event long after its occurrence. Besides, with 840,000 residents spread over 70 communities, why shouldn't Bergen County have its own FM radio station?"
Bergen County's only commercial radio station, WWDJ, is a Hackensack AM station that plays primarily religious programming. On the FM band, WFDU, run by Fairleigh Dickenson University, and WRPR, operated by Ramapo College of New Jersey, are part-time educational stations.
There are some who contend that the service gap does not exist. Debbie Sheehan is the director of news and community affairs at WPAT-FM, which has opposed Mr. Turro's efforts. "While our signal covers four states," she said, "we do cover Bergen County news, weather and traffic. We even air a weekly show produced by Bergen Community College."
 
'Lost Dogs and All of That'
 Her station, which is based in Paterson, has a different mission from that of WJUX, she acknowledges. "As a noncommercial station," she said, "he can be much more local, looking for lost dogs and all of that."
A half-century after the original Alpine radio experiments, FM's superior sound has stolen the march from AM radio. With that shift, the price of acquiring an FM radio license in the New York metropolitan area has risen into the tens of millions of dollars. With licenses hard to come by, Mr. Turro reached back to his college days for a way to shoehorn a new station onto the crowded radio dial.
As a student at Montclair State College in the 1970's, Mr. Turro had learned that even a low-power FM station could cover a respectable distance if its tower were placed at a high enough spot. He began a tutorial in radio engineering under Lee Martin, who had been hired to build and run WMSC-FM, the college's low-power educational station.
Mr. Martin, 49 -- now WJUX's vice president, music director and "morning man" on the air -- said that "up until that point no one had realized the potential of low-power FM stations." Full-power commercial FM radio stations routinely operate with 5,000 to as much as 100,000 watts of transmission power. "But there we were with a college radio station that put out less than nine-tenths of a watt, and our signal could be heard in New York City," Mr. Martin said.
Mr. Turro received F.C.C. permission to increase the output of his transmission towers atop the Mediterranean Towers apartment complex in Fort Lee, from 4 watts to 35 watts, offsetting the expense of the expansion, in part, with the retransmission fees he received from a handful of commercial radio stations. Now he was ready to ask the Federal agency for permission to originate his own local programming.
The National Association of Broadcasters, a trade group, opposed Mr. Turro's petition on the basis that allowing the conversion of an FM repeater station represented unfair competition. Several stations in the New York, including WPAT, also opposed the petition. Concerned that Mr. Turro's request might produce an avalanche of similar proposals, the agency turned him down in 1987. The decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
In 1991, Mr. Turro was an engineering consultant to WRRH, the educational station at 88.7 FM operated by Ramapo-Indian Hills Regional High School, when the school board decided to trim its budget and close the station. Mr. Turro offered to buy the 10-watt operation for $100,000 spread over 10 years. The board accepted.
 
Foundation Established
 Now, Mr. Turro was in a position to originate programming, under his WRRH license, and to increase that station's signal countywide from his tower in Fort Lee. But the Franklin Lakes educational license prevents WJUX from accepting commercial advertising. So he and Mr. Martin have established the Bergen County Community Broadcast Foundation, a nonprofit organization, to operate the station, which, Mr. Turro said, "is seeking sponsorships from area businesses, not unlike the enhanced underwriting grants solicited by public TV stations like Channel 13."
In addition, he said, "our educational license requires us to broadcast programming produced by educational institutions in the area."
David E. Schutz, a media analyst and vice president of Hoffman Schutz Media Capital, an investment banking concern in New York, offered this view of Mr. Turro and his business:
"On one hand, WJUX is a testament to Gerry Turro's perseverance. But ultimately the question is 'How valuable is this station that he has created?' Mr. Turro would like to believe that he has created a station that has the economic value of a traditional station. But because he is dramatically limited in the amount of time he can sell,the most optimistic revenue estimate that I have been able to come up with is something around three-quarters of a million dollars a year."
To which Mr. Turro replied, "I only hope he's right."
Still, the engineer won't allow his dream to be dismissed so easily. "I might again consider approaching the commission," he said, challenging the F.C.C. programming restrictions for FM repeaters once more.
As WJUX was gearing up for its start, word arrived that WNEW-AM, the longtime New York station where Mr. Turro's wife, Jeanne Starr, was a news announcer, was dropping its own big-band jazz format in favor of business news. WNEW's musical format and a number of its on-the-air personalities have since migrated to WQEW-AM, the New York Times station formerly known as WQXR-AM.
WJUX's reliance on nostalgic tunes from the 40's and 50's, Mr. Martin said, closely matches the tastes of a potentially large audience because Bergen County's population is older than that found elsewhere in the New York market.
 
Taste for Times Past
 In the studios here, Mr. Turro's own taste for times past, as well as his tenacious nature, is on display. The wall racks are lined with thousands of tape cartridges of 40's and 50's music he says he "rescued" from WNEW's garbage Dumpster. Framed WNEW promotional posters were also dredged from the garbage. The chromed 50's-vintage microphone, the worn 1970's control panel and a tan Formica console of the same radio era were all salvaged by Mr. Turro from the stations where he had worked. He had collected and stored the items at his home in the steadfast belief that he would ultimately get his way.
"On the day we went on the air," Mr. Turro said, "I told our listeners: 'Never give up on your dreams, no matter what people say or do. Because if you want it you will get it.' "

Stocks Are High, Even in the Face of Inflation

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IF one measure of an investment is its ability to keep up with inflation, then the stock market has been brilliant over the past decade.
The accompanying chart shows the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, measured as a multiple of the consumer price index. When share prices rise exactly as much as inflation, that figure stays even. If inflation outstrips stock price gains, as happened in the late 1970's, the index plunges dramatically. 
 The consumer price index, measuring the cost of a basket of consumer goods, rose only 0.1 percent in March, while the S.& P. climbed 1.9 percent. So stock prices adjusted for inflation climbed to a new high, at 3.15 times the consumer price index. One way to look at that number is that it would have taken 3.15 baskets of consumer goods to buy a combination of the stocks in the S.& P. at the end of March. By contrast, back in 1982 the stocks were worth only 1.1 baskets of consumer goods. Over that period, stock prices rose almost three times as much as did inflation.

HEADLINE: What BMW Sees In South Carolina

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: SPARTANBURG, S.C.

 BODY:
GLEAMING black BMW 740 sedans, costing $60,000 each, glide up and down the broad boulevard that is this city's main street, their elegance a striking contrast to the crumbling buildings and vacant lots, once home to so many knitting mills.
The cars belong mostly to BMW executives, who are becoming more numerous by the week. They are here because BMW A.G., after scouring the world, has chosen a 900-acre stretch of red clay halfway between Spartanburg and Greenville to build a car assembly plant. The attraction: promises of an eager, technically trained work force, the proximity of both the port of Charleston and numerous automotive suppliers, tax incentives and a favorable climate. 
 The BMW plant, with its high-paying jobs and bountiful spinoff revenue for local business and government, represents hope to a diverse group of South Carolinians, from young students in technical colleges to state development officers. Moreover, it is a crowning flourish to the migration of manufacturers and automotive suppliers to the foothills along Interstate 85: It is the first car-assembly plant in the Carolinas.
It may not be the last. Many industrial development experts are convinced that Mercedes-Benz A.G. is leaning toward the nearby Charlotte, N.C., area. Mercedes said last Monday that within a few months it would select an American site at which to build a new model of a sport-utility vehicle.
Rumors also abound that Volkswagen A.G. is looking for an American site to make its Audi luxury cars. All three German auto makers have slipped badly in the United States market since the early 1980's, as the mark has climbed in value and the Japanese have introduced successful luxury imports like Acura, Lexus and Infiniti.
Conversely, the weak dollar, eager recruiters from regions like the Carolinas and generous tax incentives are turning the United States into an attractive manufacturing site and a base for export.
Whether the Carolinas evolve into an important German automotive production center -- in the way Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee became a haven for Japanese transplants -- will depend largely on BMW's success in hiring, organizing and training an innovative work force that can produce high-quality luxury cars economically.
Labor unions, distressed that South Carolina is a right-to-work state, have accused BMW of exploiting America as though it were the third world. Company officials scoff at union predictions of a $10-an-hour wage -- about two-thirds the auto industry's average and only a bit above South Carolina's average manufacturing wage of $9.78 an hour. If only to remove an incentive to join the union, BMW's wage will be on par with the American auto industry's wage of $15 to $16 an hour, but its labor costs could be less than half what they are in Germany. Mercedes and Volkswagen would also enjoy big cost advantages over their plants in Germany.
BMW's plant will initially be smaller than conventional plants like the General Motors Corporation's Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., or the Toyota Motor Corporation's plant in Georgetown, Ky. With relatively high prices on its cars -- $30,000 and up -- and below-average capital costs, BMW expects to be profitable with initial annual production of only 60,000 cars, about a third the size of most American auto assembly lines.
But profitability will require a work force unlike that in most plants, and even better than those in Japanese plants.
"A lot of auto makers invest in technology, not in people. We're going back to the base line and investing in people," said Allen O. Kinzer, president of BMW's manufacturing plant here. He was the first American manager hired by the Honda Motor Company 15 years ago and is a former Honda senior vice president who helped supervise the Marysville, Ohio, operations.
Borrowing from Honda and others, BMW wants to enlarge on the concept of work teams, in which members can perform one another's jobs. Eventually BMW wants to authorize teams to operate quickly and independently, with little moment-to-moment supervision. If a model isn't selling well, the work force must be able to adapt quickly to building a different model.
Like the Japanese auto makers who located transplants in rural locations, BMW expects to benefit from the strong agrarian work ethic that still influences many workers in South Carolina. Susan E. Conway, who helped introduce "self-directed" work teams in five Sara Lee Corporation knitting mills in the South, has been hired as vice president for human resources. She will help recruit the workers and shape the teams.
"By the time we were finished, Sara Lee team members could literally board a plane and fly to California without permission," Ms. Conway recalled. She and others have been studying G.M.'s Saturn plant, where teams elect their own leaders, and Honda, where top management appoints leaders.
A distinctive touch, Mr. Kinzer said, is that the variety of tasks will demand more technical skills of every worker than at most car plants. "Our plant won't be highly automated," he said. "In a way, it is a return to the craft system," used early in the century when cars were built mostly by hand.
At the rate applications for jobs have been pouring into BMW's temporary offices in Spartanburg, the company expects 100,000 or more applications for the first 1,000 jobs, Mr. Kinzer said. Eventually the work force will swell to 2,000. So BMW can be selective. Mr. Kinzer said he wants workers who are highly motivated, independent and adaptable. Undoubtedly, BMW also hopes enthusiastic new hires will reject U.A.W. representation.
"The reason people here haven't joined unions is that they're an independent lot, who don't like anyone telling them where and when they'll work," said Bruce Yandle, a professor of economics and legal studies at Clemson University. He traces anti-union spirit to the yeoman farmers who left the fields for factories in the 1800's: "The history of people working to the rhythm of factories is long, and the relationship between mill owners and their workers is close."
That fits with BMW's plans. Instead of constantly repeating one or two 20-second tasks, a worker might perform several tasks, requiring several minutes. Low absenteeism is crucial, because a multi-skilled worker is difficult to replace.
The workers will also use fewer automated machines. For example, some workers will be trained as spot welders -- almost a forgotten skill at some assembly plants -- because BMW is not buying an automated body welder, which can cost several million dollars. Automated welding machinery must often must be scrapped when a new model is built, Mr. Kinzer said, and having a highly skilled work force will enable BMW to switch models more easily, quickly and cheaply. Eventually, he said, higher production and automation may come, but only after everyone becomes expert at building cars.
South Carolina's 16 technical colleges, which tailor their courses to manufacturers' requirements, were a strong attraction to BMW, said Jay Gogue, vice president of research for Clemson. After a manufacturer enumerates the skills it needs, the colleges buy tools and teach courses. Afterward, the manufacturer may hire as many or as few students as it needs, without obligation.
 
 
 
A TRICKY WALTZ WITH LABOR
 BMW wishes to avoid a bruising fight against organized labor. Organized labor, on the other hand, can ill afford to lose more members and prestige.
But when it comes to winning workers to the union, the Carolinas are not Detroit. Once known chiefly for carpets, cloth and garments, the region has been striving to live down a history of low-skill jobs, poor school systems and a consequent dearth of economic opportunity. Unions fared poorly in their bids to organize textile mills.
This bitter legacy was recalled only last week when Robert A. Georgine, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s building trades department, vilified BMW, accusing it of selecting South Carolina for its low wages, to take advantage of "American workers as if we were a third-world country." At a demonstration outside BMW's North American headquarters in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., Mr. Georgine demanded that the German automaker and the Fluor Corporation, which will build the 1.2 million square foot factory, hire only union contractors. Groundbreaking is scheduled within weeks, with completion by the fall of 1994. Likewise, the United Automobile Workers has vowed to organize BMW.
"I don't think the union is going to make too many friends down here by calling us a third-world country," said Ron Oakley, a vice president of Fluor, whose modern campus in Greenville bespeaks the economic renaissance of the New South.
Fluor announced it would give preference to construction subcontractors from South Carolina -- who happen to be mostly nonunion -- for the BMW project. Mr. Oakley said: "We do what our clients request.
Because unions have few members and little sympathy in South Carolina, labor relations experts agree that BMW and Fluor stand an excellent chance to keep the unions out, but no one is absolutely sure.
Daimler Benz A.G., Mercedes's parent, may be cautious in selecting a North Carolina site for its new sport-utility vehicle assembly plant because it lost a U.A.W. recognition election at a Freightliner truck plant in Mount Holly, N.C., in 1991.
On the other hand, the U.A.W. concluded it couldn't organize Honda's Marysville, Ohio, plant five years ago and canceled its recognition election. Allen O. Kinzer, president of BMW's new North American assembly plant, was working at Honda then.

THE ECONOMY
 
Attaching Numbers to the Clinton Economic Vision 

Here's the Clinton vision for America, now with dollar signs attached, as seen in the $1.52 trillion budget sent to Congress: a nation that needs more health care (Medicare and Medicaid spending up strongly) and is less military-minded (Pentagon spending way down), a nation that squanders less on farm-price supports and invests more in mass transit (with much of that new money going to New York and New Jersey). A nation that spends more on public works, education and retraining, and one that -- through tax credits -- lets fewer people slip into poverty. Who will pay the bill? Corporations and the wealthy will chip in more, anyone who uses any fuel will ante up, and some Social Security recipients will pay more taxes. The Administration is "trying to change the priorities for this country," said Leon Panetta, the budget director. And that change is given a good chance to become reality; as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it, "We simply have to do it."
 
Jobs: Seeking Balance
 
President Clinton is learning that dealing with Congress is a balancing act, with compromise often needed. After his $19.5 billion jobs bill got mired by a Republican filibuster in the Senate, he finally admitted that he would have to trim back his stimulus proposal. The bill includes, among other things, $4 billion for extending unemployment benefits, $6 billion for public works, $2 billion for summer jobs and $2.5 billion for community development grants. (That last item has drawn special criticism from Republicans, who suspect pork-barrel projects.) But Mr. Clinton "is going to fight for as much of this program as he can get," George Stephanopoulos said. His first goal: to soften up a few key Republicans after the Senate gets back from its recess.
 
Tax Million-Plus Pay! (Maybe.)
 
It happens every time. A strong, simple campaign one-liner becomes a Presidential paragraph, littered with footnotes. Why, candidate Clinton asked, should taxpayers subsidize those multimillion-dollar corporate salaries? Let's cut off tax deductibility of such largess at an even million. Period. But President Clinton, a bit older and a lot wiser to Washington realities, has softened that considerably. Administration officials now say, well, they guess it's O.K. to deduct pay over $1 million -- as long as the compensation is tied to performance and as long as shareholders approve. (Commission income -- for, say, real estate sales -- is exempt.) There would be shareholder committees, compensation committees -- but in the end a lot of those people who have decided they really need $5 million a year to pay the bills will probably get it. Reason not the need.
 
Don't Bury the Airlines Yet
 
Just as mourners were gathered to bury the domestic airline industry, trumpets sounded a flurry of good news. The big surprise was a sharp jump in March traffic (which would have been even greater without the blizzard), coupled with word of strong bookings for coming months. After five bleak years, airline executives started whispering a bizarre idea: a profitable summer. On top of this, airlines did some serious whittling: United trimmed some plane orders, American dropped some flights from its San Jose hub and Delta abandoned its no-layoff policy. Investors were jolted awake, sending the S.&P. airline index to a 52-week high.
 
For Sale: 'Koresh's Last Stand'
 
General Custer clearly lived in the wrong era. If he'd been at Little Bighorn in the 1990's, he'd have battled the Sioux with one hand and clutched a cellular phone in the other, hawking his story to book agents. David Koresh is another matter. You'd think he had his hands full last week, weighing the fate of his Branch Davidian followers, bombarded with jarring music, nursing his wounds. But no. He must truly have heaven-sent powers, for with all that, he found time to get two New York lawyers to act as his literary agents. And for his story, they're talking millions. Multimillions.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
With This Check I Thee Wed
 
The generalities, the vague promises, are over. As Boris Yeltsin put it, his talks with Bill Clinton last weekend signaled "a shift from general assurances of support to Russia to pragmatic, specific, nitty-gritty projects." As the two Presidents kept tripping over each other in their vows of everlasting devotion, Mr. Clinton pledged a larger-than-expected $1.6 billion in aid. Central to that aid are credits to allow immediate grain exports and help for small businesses and a market economy. "We are with Russian reforms," Mr. Clinton vowed. "We are with Russian markets." Mr. Yeltsin's assessment: The aid deal "is going to make history."
 
One Space Station Is Plenty
 
One world, one space station -- it makes perfect sense. With the cold war over, why should both the United States and Russia spend the grocery money building rival outposts in space? Why indeed, the White House said last week, ordering NASA to work with the Russians to design a smaller, cheaper space station. The Administration had already ordered a cut of up to two-thirds in the $31 billion price tag, and this step could make such a cut possible. And, it seems, it's a win-win-win situation for President Clinton -- contractors are happy because the project's alive, Boris Yeltsin is happy to be aboard and budget-cutters are always glad for a few dollars.
 
Germany, Still Inflation-Shy
 
Ever since the catastrophic 1920's, Germany has been terrified of inflation -- and it's not about to let its guard down now. Inflation did rear up a bit after the Government borrowed heavily to finance reunification, and the Bundesbank put a stop to it by raising interest rates. And now, high as they are, the central bank is going to be awfully careful about relaxing them. Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, reiterated this commitment last week, though he did say, "As we see maneuvering room opening up, we will use it" to lower rates gradually.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Leslie Fay Seeks Refuge
 
Even untroubled apparel makers live hand to mouth, buying materials on credit and paying it back when clothes are sold. So when trouble strikes, this delicate fabric unravels -- no credit, no clothes, nothing. After Leslie Fay was turned upside down by an accounting scandal in which losses had been called profits, it quickly became a lot harder to borrow money -- even though business was good and orders were strong. So last week, perhaps inevitably, Leslie Fay sought refuge in bankruptcy court to try to get the cycle going again. The company is expected to come out of the ordeal stronger, but probably smaller.
 
Westinghouse Sheds Its 'Junk'
 
The 60's may be back in style, but a lot of companies are still trying to put the 80's behind them. Westinghouse did its penance last week, selling most of the "junk real estate" its finance unit took on in those strange days.
 
Circuit City, Kick Those Tires
 
Selling used cars is a lot different from selling electronic gadgets. A VCR is a VCR. You know what it costs, and you know it's identical to its cousin in the next box. A used car is murkier. A fair price? Pick a number. Under that polished hood could lurk untold demons, waiting to do their worst a mile from the dealer's lot. But Circuit City saw its future last week, and it had a car lot in it. Startling Wall Street and just about everyone else, the home electronics giant said it would try out the used-car game. It may be onto something: As one analyst pointed out, when you're through kicking tires, they just may be able to sell you a car alarm or a cellular phone.
 
Filling Size-20 Shoes at G.M.
 
Try to imagine it: Corporate giants across the globe battle over an executive, treating him as if he were Henry Ford, the Messiah and Attila the Hun's smarter brother rolled into one. Then, when your company loses out, you -- gulp! -- get his job. "Tough act to follow" -- that doesn't begin to describe the pressure. Well somebody had to replace Ignacio Lopez, the near-mythic G.M. cost-cutter who abruptly drove off to Volkswagen recently. That somebody is G. Richard Wagoner, G.M.'s chief financial officer, who at the tender age of 40 will be charged with keeping up the Lopez cost-saving momentum. Don't worry: only the whole automotive world is watching.
 
He Tripled Life's Word Score
 
Can you imagine life without Lexiko? You probably can, until you discover that that's what Alfred Butts wanted to call the board game he invented during the Depression. Game makers weren't interested. But nearly two decades later, renamed Scrabble by a friend of Mr. Butts and given a mass market by Macy's, the game took its permanent place among life's fixtures. Mr. Butts got 3 cents in royalties for every set sold -- and there were nearly 100 million of them. But could that buy him a Q and a Z on a triple word score? Well, no -- his wife, Nina, usually beat him. Mr. Butts, having made this a more lettered world, died last week at 93.
 
Trouble for Surgical Stocks
 
As the nation waits to see how the Clinton team will rewrite the rules for health care, investors are taking no chances. Drug stocks have taken a beating, and last week two surgical stocks took their lumps. United States Surgical and Medtronic, the highest of high fliers in recent years, both hit 52-week lows. United States Surgical, which also forecast poor quarterly results, was hit the hardest. After trading well over $100 a year ago, the stock plummeted to $31.375.

HEADLINE: A New Rush Into Latin America

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
EVEN as much of the world dissolves into a single, faceless market, some things just won't happen. Dunkin' Donuts would not try to sell baguettes to Parisians. Benihana would not open hot-dog stands in the United States. Pepsico, surely, would not sell tacos to the Mexicans.
Think again on that last one. Pepsico, which owns the Taco Bell chain, saw the fattening wallets of Mexico's younger generation, splashed some extra hot sauce onto its tacos and headed across the border. 
 Call it Pepsi's Latin invasion. And it's not just tacos, and not just Mexico. Last month the company announced a $750 million, five-year assault in Mexico, including plans to buy interests in big bottlers, buy distribution routes and advertise heavily. The company is opening Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC franchises throughout Latin America, and selling Fritos, Ruffles and Doritos chips as far south as Tierra del Fuego. And it will soon announce that later this year it will spend tens of millions of dollars to sponsor Michael Jackson on an eight-city tour of Latin America.
"Latin America is our highest strategic priority and we do not see a more compelling investment opportunity anywhere in the world," said Ken Ross, chief spokesman for the corporation's international division. "We've had explosive growth in the region."
Pepsico has company. Led by the consumer-products, technology and service sectors, businesses in the United States, Japan and Europe have quadrupled their investments in Latin America in the past three years. Nearly $100 billion was invested in the region from 1990 through 1992, primarily in Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil, up from $24 billion for the previous three years.
A few examples: Wal-Mart, Kmart, Sears, J. C. Penney, Price Club and other retailers have entered Mexico in the last year or stepped up operations there. Anheuser-Busch is buying a $477 million stake in Mexico's largest brewery. Ford has opened a modern axle factory in Argentina. Digital Equipment has teamed with Chile's largest software producer to sell its machines across Latin America. A small California disk-drive maker, Memotech, is moving its manufacturing operations to Chile.
NBC and Fox have announced plans for Latin American cable television networks. China's state-owned steel group has acquired Peru's state iron company. The NEC Corporation has entered a telecommunications joint venture with Argentina's largest industrial concern, Perez Companc. Mitsubishi has won a $150 million contract to build a power-generation plant for Chile's state copper company. And Hilton is building a luxury hotel in Punta del Este, the posh Uruguayan resort.
In addition, investors seeking profits in Latin America's volatile emerging stock markets have poured billions into the Buenos Aires, Santiago, Sao Paulo, Caracas and Mexico City stock exchanges.
 
A Surging Population
 The rush into Latin America is based on an idea that only a few years ago would have seemed unthinkable -- that this market of 470 million people from Mexico to Argentina (including the Caribbean) could be one of the more stable growth investments of the closing years of this century and beyond.
Some economists and government officials are arguing that now is the time for the United States to alter longstanding economic policies that favor Europe and Asia in favor of one that promotes closer ties in the Americas, arguing that Latin America's booming markets can be a critical source of economic strength to American business.
"If you are the new President of the United States and your top priority is restoring domestic economic growth, then Latin America is your best customer," said David Mulford, former Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under Presidents Bush and Reagan and now vice chairman of First Boston. "It is returning to strength at a time when Europe and Japan are in recession, and you should be very much aware of the fact that Latin America is contributing to Main Street America, creating jobs and economic activity."
Indeed, since the region's collective nadir in 1989, most Latin American nations have significantly increased their growth and lowered their inflation rates. Only Brazil and Peru lack a healthy rate of growth, and only Brazil currently suffers hyperinflation, although several other countries have rates above 25 percent.
Mr. Mulford argues that Latin America has a number of other attractions. "We have a common historical religious and social heritage with Latin America, and it is now made up almost exclusively of democratic governments," he said. "They have much more sophisticated market economies than the new states of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. "It's a market of almost 600 million," he said, referring to an estimate for the population in 15 years. That would even put Europe in the shade.
He added that the United States already accounts for 57 percent of Latin American imports, compared with only 11 percent of Japan's and 22 percent of Europe's.
 
The Risks
 That is not to say that Latin America is not still a risky investment.
To keep investment dollars coming, many of its central banks have kept real interest rates high, a drag on growth. Much of the pent-up consumer demand from the 1980's was satiated in 1991 and 1992, dimming the outlook for this year. There is pressure on governments to devalue their currencies to make exports more competitive, but such devaluations would quickly lift inflation.
In December, the International Monetary Fund lowered its growth projections for the region, to 2 percent in 1993, from 3.9 percent. The main reasons were a continued recession in Brazil and slower than expected growth in Mexico and Argentina as high trade deficits robbed local industry of production and jobs.
And politics could change the picture for the worse. This is a year of presidential or other important elections in Chile, Bolivia, Mexico, Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. The elections tend to put more pressure on governments to increase spending, which can lead to higher rates of inflation.
Moreover, memories of a troubled past are still fresh. The democratic regimes that now govern all Central and South American countries except French Guiana are still fragile -- susceptible to military coup attempts, as was seen last year in Venezuela, and leaders who seize extraordinary powers, as has Peru's President, Alberto K. Fujimori. Social unrest, the product of entrenched poverty and guerrilla and drug-trade violence, threatens the political order in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.
 
Remember the 1970's
 The recent surge in interest in Latin America is not the first.
In the 1970's, banks and international lending organizations lent hundreds of billions of dollars in the region, primarily to governments and state-owned businesses. But the money went to cover budget deficits and finance projects that became plagued by bureaucratic tangles, corruption and mismanagement. Foreign companies followed the lead of the lenders and set up shop in Latin America, but frequently encountered attempts at nationalization, high inflation and policies favoring local companies.
The investment climate here has changed radically since then. Now, much more of the lending is to privately owned local industrial groups for specific projects. And foreign investors are being much more cautious, often refusing to commit unless they can find prestigious local partners to share the risk.
The economic approaches recently embraced by most Latin governments -- emphasizing open markets, low inflation and balanced budgets -- have enabled them to strike agreements with commercial banks to reduce once-onerous debt levels. That has opened the door to the international markets and new borrowing both by companies and governments, reversing a history of defaulting on debt payments that left Latin America a pariah throughout the 1980's.
In 1991 and 1992, for example, Latin America raised an average of $12 billion each year in bond and stock offerings in the international markets, compared with an annual average of less than $1 billion throughout most of the 1980's.
Still, corporate managers say they are moving much more cautiously than in the past. William Rhodes, the Citicorp vice chairman who heads negotiations with countries over reorganizing their commercial bank debt, said the most important thing to businesses is the assurance that the new economic thinking will last.
Investors, he said, are waiting longer than they did in the 1970's before jumping in. "Corporate executives want to have the feeling that the continuity is there," he said, "that after two years of reform, the change is permanent, not a fleeting thing."
 
Five Favorites
 Economists and bankers generally agree that the most attractive Latin American countries for investment are these:
* Mexico, the top choice, because of proximity to the United States and the chance of a free-trade agreement with Washington, plus a huge domestic market and economic reforms.
* Chile, the second choice, with the fastest-growing and perhaps most open economy; the smallness of its market and distance from the United States are slight disadvantages.
* Argentina, third, because of the vast changes in the past two years in a country that was prone to hyperinflation and military government; but investors are worried about an overvalued peso and continued government corruption.
* Venezuela, fourth, with vast oil reserves and open markets; but two attempted coups against President Carlos Andres Perez have worried investors.
* Brazil, fifth, for its sheer size, industrial strength and natural resources; but 1,200 percent inflation and a lack of a coherent economic policy have investors essentially in a holding pattern.
The cautious new invasion of Latin America is not led by heavy industry, nor by the historical attraction of exploiting low-cost labor and abundant natural resources. Rather, it tends to be a tapping of parts of the local market that sorely need development.
Throughout Latin America there is an acute shortage of banking services, computerization, telecommunications, shopping centers, supermarkets, hotels, insurance and a host of other services. Thus, many of the corporate players are in consumer-products, technology and services.
"Most people think computer sales can only grow more or less at the rate of overall economic growth, but that is just wrong for less developed countries such as in Latin America," said Richard O. Martorana, president of I.B.M. in Argentina. "In these markets, the demand for such services often far exceeds growth."
 
The Move Into Chile
 Chile is a good example of heightened investment by consumer-product and technology companies. Pepsico late last year announced a $100 million investment program, buying the country's largest bottler and snack-food concerns, and opening KFC's and Pizza Huts in Santiago. In late 1991, Digital Equipment teamed up with Chile's largest software manufacturer, Sonda, adapting its hardware to accommodate Sonda software and marketing it in 14 Latin countries. It is now the largest Latin computer company.
Also, Sonda recently joined Memotech International of Milpitas, Calif., which found the costs of making hard disk drives prohibitive in California. Memotech now plans to start manufacturing in Chile in July, not only for the Latin American market but for Europe and the United States as well.
Foreign investment in mining, fishing, energy and other natural resources is also strong. In Chile, for example, the Phelps Dodge Corporation and the Sumitomo Mining and Metals Company announced last November a $1.5 billion mining project for copper and gold. And in Venezuela last month, the Exxon Corporation, the Mitsubishi Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell signed a $3 billion joint venture agreement with the state gas company to develop natural gas.
As for Pepsico, the attraction of Latin America seems obvious. "It's a very young population and a growing one," Mr. Ross said. "The markers are all favorable."
 
 
 
CHANGING THE PERSPECTIVE IN WASHINGTON
 BUENOS AIRES
IN Washington, it is generally acknowledged that United States policy toward Latin America has historically involved little more than worrying about containment of Communism and the promotion of democracy.
As a strategic economic market, Latin America has been hardly a blip on the political radar in Washington, with the exception of Mexico and the occasions when governments defaulted on debt payments in the 1980's, threatening the stability of the international banking system.
But if Latin America continues to show growth as it has in the past two years, to control inflation and to maintain stability, it may have to be considered in a different light.
Some are arguing that Washington should take a lead in this, if for no other reason than safeguarding the United States' own commercial interests.
Policy recommendations generally have two goals. One is to insure that the region, historically prone to protectionism, remains open to American business by keeping tariffs low and helping governments in modernizing their capital markets, banking systems and regulation of industry -- in effect, integrating them more into the world financial markets.
Don E. Newquist, chairman of the International Trade Commission, has recommended that the United States use the hope of bilateral free trade pacts as a prod. He has suggested that such an accord be signed with Chile even before the one with Mexico, arguing that it would send a signal to other Latin countries that democratic governments promoting open markets will be rewarded.
David Mulford, former Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs and now vice chairman of First Boston, says the Clinton Administration should continue many of the programs begun under President Bush's Initiative for the Americas.
Among other things, these would create investment funds to help the development of small businesses, to study ways of reducing regulation and to institute changes in the judicial process to insure equal protection for foreign investors.

Labor's Return to Prominence

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
HERE'S one more sign that the Labor Department is working through the post-traumatic stress of its 12 years in the hands of Republicans. Early this month, Labor Secretary Robert Reich appointed a longtime union activist to run the Glass Ceiling Commission, a group devoted to figuring out why women and minorities seem to get stuck in the pipeline below the top tier of large corporations.
The lack of female C.E.O.'s has not heretofore been viewed as a critical labor issue, and Joyce Miller, a vice president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women, can be expected to expand her constituency beyond those with their eyes on a corner office. Ms. Miller has been around the glass ceiling problems of the labor movement long enough to bring relevant experience to the job she will begin on May 3. 
 The Miller appointment represents in a small way a change in the attitude, most recently articulated by Lynn Martin, George Bush's last Labor Secretary, that the Labor Department ministers to a gorgeous mosaic of interests, one insignificant tile of which is organized labor. Robert Reich has restored a labor agenda -- if not in every detail the one labor itself wants -- to a central place in the department and has made several appointments from the labor movement. He has through sheer peripatetism moved Labor into a position of prominence it hasn't had in decades. Ms. Martin's high profile, especially between the Republican Convention and the election in November, derived mostly from the confidence of Bush campaign officials that she could be relied upon to use verbs when speaking.
When asked to enumerate her accomplishments, Ms. Martin invariably referred to the department's 1991 "Report on the Glass Ceiling Initiative" and "Pipelines of Progress," the update that followed in 1992. Both documents encouraged corporations to work toward "full and equal employment opportunity," and Ms. Martin frequently spoke out on the issue.
The glass ceiling commission, which she chaired, appears to have played a less than influential role in the Secretary's interest in the advancement of women and minorities. Since it was created by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, it has had one meeting and one field hearing. Ms. Miller, who is resigning from her various positions in the labor movement to take the Washington job, plans to begin by redefining the "glass ceiling." Miller says she told Secretary Reich, "I want to help people with their feet stuck in the mud." Ms. Miller said she would consider appointing a blue-collar advisory committee immediately, with other subcommittees in special problem areas -- the needs of minority women, for example -- to follow as necessary.
ROBERT REICH arrived at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s winter meetings in Florida last February with ambiguous word of mouth. His sympathies were not well known, and he had rarely mentioned unions or the labor movement in his crusade -- already under way only a few weeks into the new An occasional roundup of labor news.
Administration -- for global competitiveness, increased productivity and well-paid work. Labor leaders were pleasantly amazed when he promised to appoint a commission to study labor law reform, a cause filibustered to death by Congressional Republicans in 1978 that had been universally regarded as unresurrectable -- until Mr. Reich slouched into Bal Harbour.
Mr. Reich, a man who frequently denies that he is a politician, has followed through on his promise. Late last month, he and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown announced the "formation of a panel to investigate methods to improve the productivity and global competitiveness of the American workplace." Mr. Reich still puts his fingernails to the chalkboard, as far as labor is concerned, by using such phrases as worker-management "cooperation." "Cooperation," in labor's view, is too close to "co-optation." The labor word of choice: "participation."
But if Mr. Reich doesn't always talk the talk, he seems to be walking the walk. Business, especially small business, must be wondering what price it will pay for the banging labor took during the 1980's. The Commission for the Future of Worker-Management Relations, as the reform panel is known at parties and mixers all over Washington, is composed of 10 of the cultural elite, many of them labor's usual suspects: John Dunlop, Ray Marshall and William Usery, former Labor Secretaries; Douglas Fraser, former president of the United Auto Workers; Juanita Kreps, Commerce Secretary in the Carter Administration; Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist; Thomas Kochan, an industrial relations expert from M.I.T.; Walter Gould 4th, a Stanford Law professor, Paula Voos, an economist at the University of Wisconsin. Only Paul Allaire, head of Xerox, comes from the corporate sector, and not from the rough-and-tumble environment of small and medium-sized businesses.
To labor, reform means at least loosening restrictions on organizing and more enforcement of existing laws. Business associations oppose as implacably as ever any changes that would give labor leverage and would like to unleash themselves from various regulatory agencies. The fight over reform may end up being a deja-vu-all-over-again scenario, with Senator Orrin Hatch, who led the filibuster in 1978, back up on the rostrum for another long haul.
 
 
JOBS, JOBS AND MORE JOBS
 ROBERT REICH'S -- and Bill Clinton's -- emphasis on jobs is evident in the budget announced last week. Mr. Reich has earmarked $10.9 billion over five years for employment and training programs. The highlights of the proposed fiscal year '94 budget: $657 million to help and retrain workers dislocated by military base closings or the North American Free Trade Agreement; $1.3 billion for a youth summer jobs program; $16 million for an apprentice program for the three-quarters of high school graduates who do not go on to college.
Mr. Reich used the unveiling on Wednesday to sound a warning: "This is a jobless recovery. We are not even at the level where we were before, or let's say nine months before the trough" of the recession.
Money for new programs will be squeezed out of other areas of the budget. Mr. Reich said he had already saved $95,000 by closing Labor's executive dining room.

Automotive Lighting: Leaving the Dark Ages Behind

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB; Eric A. Taub is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer specializing in technology and author of "Taurus: The Making of the Car That Saved Ford."

 BODY:
ANYONE who has driven down a dark street and found it difficult to see, even though the car's headlights are on, can take heart.
Over the next several years, an entirely new type of automotive lighting will become commonplace, one that promises to light up the roads of America like never before. It's called high-intensity discharge, or HID lighting. 
 A HID lamp will produce up to two and one half times more light than today's low-beam headlamps, use less electricity, and last 10 times as long. HID is the centerpiece of several new lighting innovations that manufacturers including BMW, Ford and General Motors will introduce this decade, to meet an expected demand from an aging, less visually acute population for improved and more extensive lighting sources.
In terms of automotive lighting, America has historically been in the dark ages. The main reason is standards set by the Federal Government. For decades, tungsten sealed-beam headlamps were the only legal car lighting. The lamp -- with filament, reflector and lens permanently sealed -- came in only round, two- or four-lamp versions.
By the late 1970's, standard-sized rectangular units could also be fitted. In the mid-1980's the Government deregulated the lamps' shape. Consequently, today's car headlamps look significantly more modern than those that graced the boxy Chevrolet Impalas and Ford Fairmonts of 15 years ago, but they perform no better.
At the same time, European and Japanese manufacturers were selling cars in their own markets with brighter, multi-sized headlamps designed to go with the styling and dimensions of the vehicle. Despite the brightness, a sharply defined beam pattern reduced glare to oncoming drivers. Yet, when those cars were shipped to America, the bright lights were replaced by standard low-output tungsten units.
"U.S. headlamp specifications came about when lighting manufacturers took samples to empty airfields, shone them down the runway and then voted for which looked the best," said Barry Felrice, the associate administrator of rule making for the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration. "There's been no scientific study to determine the ideal pattern of light that a car headlamp should throw."
"Lighting standards have a lot of room for improvement," agreed Tom Troy, BMW's product training manager in this country. "Ideal headlights would be brighter and shine more light to the sides of the road to improve peripheral vision."
Yet, faced with an increasing need to improve vehicles' aerodynamics to increase fuel economy and pressure from car designers to integrate lights better into the overall shape of the car, domestic manufacturers have concentrated on changing the shape of the headlight, not its capabilities.
In the mid-1980's, Ford's Lincoln division became the first Detroit distributor to offer cars that used non-sealed-beam lamps that sat flush with the body panels, allowing air to flow over rather than into the lamp, streamlining the air flow. But most headlights are still of the old-fashioned variety and do not even transmit as much light as the Government standards allow.
"WE'RE allowed by regulation to produce headlights that deliver 20,000 candelas on low and 75,000 on high beam," noted Walter Kosmatka, a General Electric lighting engineer, "but regular tungsten sealed beams put out only 8,000 to 10,000; with halogen, the output rises to 12,000 on low," or 60 percent of maximum. (Halogen light is whiter than tungsten, so drivers often perceive it to be brighter.) High beams perform somewhat better; two lamps typically produce 50,000 candelas per side, while a four-lamp setup delivers 70,000, close to the legal limit.
High-intensity discharge lighting, on the other hand, delivers the permissible 20,000 candelas of brightness on low; it consumes 40 percent less electric current and generates a correspondingly smaller amount of heat. As a result, HID headlamp units can be made narrower and thinner, increasing usable space in the engine compartment and allowing smoother sculpting of the front of the vehicle.
HID lighting has been used for years in sports arenas. For cars, engineers had to reduce the bulb size and dramatically speed up the time it took the unit to illuminate, to a split second from several minutes.
Here's how HID car lighting works: a quartz glass capsule filled with inert xenon gas receives a momentary high-intensity 10,000-volt charge from an electronic ballast incorporated in the unit, causing an arc to light between two electrodes. Once lit, the charge drops back to a constant 85 volts. To protect drivers and mechanics from electrical hazards, opening the headlamp unit or ballast deactivates the system.
The extremely bright light produces a white beam mimicking the sun's rays in color. Additionally, ultraviolet light emitted by the bulb helps illuminate reflectors in road signs and any neon coloring in pedestrians' clothing. Coupled with a projection-type lens that focuses the beam and reduces glare to oncoming vehicles, the light dramatically increases illumination to the side and directly in front of the vehicle.
"These lights are demonstrably brighter, and they'll last 10,000 hours, rather than the 1,000 typical of a halogen lamp. That's the life of the vehicle," said Gil Davenport, project manager at Buick's advanced concept group. "When I drive friends around -- who know nothing about cars -- in my special HID-lit Buick, they all want to know why my headlights are so good."
BMW is the only manufacturer to offer HID lamps at present. It charges a $900 premium for the system in Europe, but includes it in the $80,900 list price of its 1993 model 750 in the United States.
Ford will introduce HID lamps as an extra-cost option in the next few years. "Once we get the price down to $50 per vehicle, it will really take off," said Larry Kazanowski, Ford's director of vehicle exterior systems, for the plastic and trim products division. Mr. Davenport's group at G.M. has asked the company to include HID lighting in its 1997 Buick Park Avenue and Oldsmobile 98, "but now I think our HID program will be extremely accelerated," he said.
The major Japanese manufacturers, Honda, Nissan and Toyota, said they were investigating HID systems, but would not comment on whether or when they would introduce them.
HID lights are so intense that, in the foreseeable future, they could become one of just two sources of a vehicle's entire lighting. In a concept called a "light engine," developed and promoted by General Electric, fiber optics, in combination with high-intensity lighting, would be used to reduce dramatically the number of replaceable bulbs in a vehicle. A car equipped with a light engine would have about 10 bulbs, in contrast to the 80 now typically used.
FIBER optic cable would feed light to wherever it was needed: headlamps, stop and turn signals could be powered by HID lamps, while halogen or light-emitting diode (L.E.D.) bulbs would do the same for interior instruments. With only a thin fiber cable transmitting light to the front of a vehicle, the area devoted to the car's lighting system can become even smaller, presenting less of a challenge to designers.
Perhaps more important to drivers, lighting door handles and floor areas, for example, which has been impractical and expensive, would be feasible with fiber optic cable. That should prove a boon to the growing number of Americans making the transition from John Lennon-style glasses to bifocals.

Form 1040? What's a Form 1040?

BYLINE: By ALAN SIEGEL and KENNETH MORRIS; Alan Siegel is chairman and chief executive, and Kenneth Morris is president, of Siegel & Gale, a company that simplifies government and business information. The Internal Revenue Service retained the firm to make tax forms easier to use but did not take its recommendations.

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON has proposed one of the most sweeping tax-reform programs in a decade, but most Americans don't really understand what he is talking about. This will become even clearer when taxpayers face up to the annual rite of filing returns for 1994, the first year that would be affected by any Clinton overhaul.
If his efforts to rally the nation behind his tax program are to succeed, the President must recognize that the country is suffering from a massive case of tax illiteracy that goes beyond the inherent complexity of the system and cuts across every economic and educational stratum. 
 Six in 10 Americans use someone else to prepare their Federal returns. Nearly 40 percent of those people turn to professional preparers because they believe it is too difficult or because they don't know how to complete a return. An additional 30 percent feel that professionals will save them money or protect them from making costly errors.
Research shows that more than half the population does not know the meaning of a progressive tax system -- in which the more you earn, the higher your tax rate -- even when given the correct answer in a multiple-choice question.
THE level of understanding drops even more with terms and concepts that taxpayers have to deal with in preparing returns.
Three in four do not understand that to be in the 28 percent bracket means that only the highest portion of a person's income is taxed at 28 percent. And only half know the difference between itemized and standard deductions -- items that must be understood to complete a return.
Compare key terms in the President's tax initiatives with the nation's tax understanding. The knowledge gap is striking. For example, nearly 8 people in 10 don't know that a tax credit, rather than a tax exemption or deduction, can reduce taxes the most. Eight of 10 also cannot define value-added taxes -- one remedy that has been proposed to help raise revenues.
Is it any surprise that Americans perceive so much inequity in the system -- especially when they understand so little about it and face such complexity in trying to comply with the rules?
To gain support for his program, the President needs to help people understand the tax system. But for true reform to occur, he must spearhead a program to simplify the tax system and make it accessible to all Americans.
Here's what the President should do:
* Make the tax system part of the educational curriculum and begin teaching in high school, or even earlier, how the system works.
* Create a "Tax Channel" on television, where people can learn tax basics and preparation.
* Set up an on-line Internal Revenue Service data base to give the growing number of taxpayers with personal computers instant access to learning materials and electronic forms.
* Simplify the tax forms. Make them easier on the eye by using more white space, fewer typefaces and frequent headings. Use plain English, more charts and examples, and instructions that teach with an easy-to-follow "how to" format. Be more informative and less adversarial in tone.
* Set a national goal of simplifying and streamlining the taxpaying process, and make it a continuing and visible part of the Administration's overall political agenda.
President Clinton is asking the nation to sacrifice for the future. Taxpayers need to understand how the system works, to have confidence that everyone shares the burden and to know they can pay their taxes without the help of experts. This would go a long way toward encouraging tax compliance rather than tax avoidance.

HEADLINE: Street of Dreams

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
THERE are many signs of revival along 125th Street, the heart of Harlem, and some of them are baffling. There is a former mugger ("That was my job," he says) who scoops sweet potato pie ice cream at Ben & Jerry's. And how to explain the 136 Italian tourists, stylish but unruly, singing phonetic English at a gospel brunch at the Cotton Club?
"Lemme hear you calling: Jesus!" Annie Sinclair, a Baptist minister, belted out on a recent Sunday afternoon. 
 "Jeeesus!" answered Giovanni Boromei, bald, 54, Roman and quite excited.
"Jesus!" Ms. Sinclair sang.
"Jeeesus!" Mr. Boromei sang back. He is the executive in charge of service operations for Rank Xerox Italy. "Very intense," he said afterward.
Ice cream and tourists are not new to 125th Street, which stretches from the Hudson River to the foot of the Triborough Bridge, through two miles of shops and street stands and decades of a rich history. This is, after all, the home of the Apollo Theater, the street that rejoiced over Joe Louis's victories, the place where Adam Clayton Powell Jr. conferred Harlem's blessing on John F. Kennedy. Riots have exploded here half a dozen times.
In many ways, this is ground zero for black America.
But after years of decline, a new vibrancy is mingling with the ghosts of a brilliant and stormy past: the boosters of 125th Street call it revitalization. For a dozen years now, they have pointed to new projects, high rents and low vacancy rates as proof that Harlem's splendor is returning.
Now, change seems tangible: Ben & Jerry's and the Body Shop have come to 125th Street as the most visible symbols. The ice-cream parlor is staffed by formerly homeless men, and the Body Shop has pledged to give all profits from its Harlem store back to the neighborhood. There are also local stores that sell fine African art and artifacts, expensive seafood, no-fat yogurt, $25 T-shirts and $100 figurines of African-American soldiers, grandmothers and other archetypes.
These high-end shops, though still few in number, have settled squarely if at times uneasily amid the usual confusion of street life. From boxes or folding tables some vendors sell generic street stuff: jeans, baseball caps, no-iron sheets, Tootsie Rolls and a vibrating mazelike game called Racing Car. And then there are other vendors, many from West Africa, who sell the products that make 125th Street the crossroads of black culture: kente cloth, black nationalist texts, fertility necklaces, dashikis, bean pies. You can buy Malcolm X potato chips on the street, just west of Malcolm X Boulevard, or Lenox Avenue.
"People do not come to 125th Street for Woolworth's or Foot Locker," said Khakira Hikmah, a 41-year-old vendor who sells crystals and incense. "They come for the cultural experience and the historical experience." (Ms. Hikmah is known on 125th Street as the lady who smokes cigars.)
Fueled by a decade of housing development, the average income in Harlem rose to $23,230 in 1990, up from $18,503 in 1980, census data show. Now 50,600 Harlem residents, out of a population of 475,000, have college degrees. Twelve years ago, the number was only 12,000. In short, Harlemites have more money to spend, and they seem to want to spend it where they live.
"People want the best," said Barbara Ann Teer, the founder of the National Black Theater. "They want to be prosperous. When a people display prosperity that means they are becoming whole."
Ms. Teer calls the street's change "a transformation or a reinvention," and she has played a large and somewhat unconventional role. A former Broadway actress who founded the theater for black productions in 1968, she watched unmoved as the theater's building on 125th Street and Fifth Avenue burned to the ground in 1983.
"People were crying, 'Oh, the National Black Theater is going,' " she said. "But I didn't feel sad, because I understood we could invent a whole new reality."
That phoenix was a $10 million arts and retail complex, built with government and private money, that serves as the anchor for the upgrading of East 125th Street, long the low-rent end of the street. The Body Shop opened there in November, and the complex also houses the Jubilee Christian Bookstore; the Uptown Comedy Club; the Gadabout restaurant; an art gallery; a mosque; a church, and a supermarket.
Ms. Teer also plans a fitting symbol for the roof: seven 15-foot statues of Nigerian gods will guard the perimeter, "as witness to our business corridor," she said.
"Our ancestors are watching us," she added. "They are going to see if we are going to get our acts together."
THERE are reminders everywhere just how far 125th Street has to go: three doors down from the complex, above a furniture store, there are six charred and boarded-up windows, a common site above the bustling street. The failure of the Freedom National Bank two years ago hacked into the street's psyche. The long recession has not helped.
Still, people are looking up these days. Five years ago, Celeste Fraser and her boss, now dead, decided to move their hair salon from the Upper West Side to 125th Street, between Fifth and Madison avenues. Despite her fears of violence, and the fact that the block had only five other businesses at the time, the salon, called Hair Nails and Things, has thrived.
Ms. Fraser, who now owns the salon, has noticed a distinct change along 125th Street.
"There is something on the avenue, and I guess you'd call it money," she said.
"One. One. One. I owe you one. One dollar. One peso. One. That's it." Rodney Love pounded the last two words into the shivering young man at the corner of 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard. The man had brought his six albums, his second load of the day, to Mr. Love's sidewalk music stand in front of the Optical Center.
Mr. Love proclaimed each record garbage, though many of the names in both batches looked promising: Diana Ross, Freda Payne, Parliament. "What have you been doing, eating these albums?" he demanded. The young man took the dollar.
But five minutes later, Mr. Love flagged down a customer, smiled his you're-so-special smile and pointed to the same stack. "Now these are the ones that just came in today," he said. "Let me show you."
Mr. Love's business philosophy is simple: "You prey on the ones who can be preyed on. I didn't learn that from me. I learned that from the white man."
One Hundred Twenty-Fifth Street has always been about commerce, but there has always been a battle over exactly who does the selling and where. On one level, the issue today centers on street vendors like Mr. Love, some of whom clog the streets and siphon business from stores.
But there is something deeper: only half the 500 or so stores along 125th Street are black-owned. So it is notable that much of the street's improvement over the last decade is a direct result of black merchants' selling items that relate directly to black American and African culture.
"It all is kind of blending together, but the dominant thing will always be the cultural piece," said Donald J. Coggsville, the president of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, a state-sponsored group. "That's what attracts the people."
The issue digs into Harlem's history: the area was settled originally by wealthy whites, and by the turn of the century, West 125th Street was the site of the Harlem Opera House, Hurdig & Seamon's Music Hall (later the Apollo Theater), movie theaters, restaurants and department stores.
In a tumult with national reverberations, black boycotters waged battles in the 1930's to integrate the sales staffs in department stores after Harlem became the center of the city's black life.
Blumstein's integrated first, in 1934, and its huge red sign stands to this day. Just a few stores down, Harlem's first race riot erupted in March 1935 when Lino Rivera, 16, was accused of stealing a 10-cent penknife from the white-owned Kress Five and Ten. Three people died.
A second riot erupted in August 1943, amid rumors that a white policeman had shot a black soldier. Sidney Poitier, Roy Wilkins and James Baldwin, on his way to bury his father, were all on 125th Street that day, as recounted in "King of the Cats: The Life and Times of Adam Clayton Powell Jr." (Houghton Mifflin, 1993).
"It seemed to me that God himself had devised, to mark my father's end, the most sustained and brutally dissonant of codas," Baldwin wrote.
More protest, peaceful and not, punctuated the 60's, as the street slid into decline. By the late 70's, two out of every five stores were vacant, and many of those that remained open were owned by Koreans.
Life is different today.
"It's such a hustle, hustle, a lot of hustle," said Inez Kennedy, a 49-year-old nurse standing at the site of the 1935 riot, now an Everyone's Drug, at 256 West 125th Street. "You have to be fast. When you look around you, you ask, 'Is this 125th Street?' It's the new 125th Street. It's the new fast breed."
People on 125th Street see its recent renewal as a cultural continuum, though a renewal that has not neared the potential -- perhaps unreachable -- that many along the street dream of. A dozen years ago, the street began its new spark with a project, still planned but not yet built, for a a $160 million International Trade Center: its focus is investment and trade in Africa.
During the 1980's, the Apollo Theater underwent a $20 million renovation, headed by Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough President. Now a nonprofit foundation, the Apollo is redefining itself, as it tries to attract top names in black entertainment and also to fight off its long history of financial trouble.
"What do I think of them?" Mr. Sutton grumbled when asked about Ice Cube, Kool G Rap and D.J. Polo playing in the same Apollo he fell in love with during World War II. "They are all part of the culture."
Next door to the Everyone's Drug is Mart 125, a bazaar of black merchants who sell everything from goat curry to Malcolm X tapes to African jewelry. The mart, now in its fifth year, is a success, often called the incubator for business on 125th Street because a handful of shops have moved from the mart into regular storefronts.
Jean Jackson, 48, has noticed broad improvement in her five years as a vendor at Mart 125. She sells clothing she sews herself from African cloth, everything from shirts to suspenders to bright hats.
"There has been an awakening here because people feel the freedom to wear pieces of their culture," she said, as she put the final touches on a deep blue and gold cummerbund and bow tie in her stall.
And still within the tradition are the scores of street vendors, some American blacks but many West Africans, who congregate in colorful quadrants, especially at the corner of Malcolm X Boulevard.
Ligar Ahmed, a vendor from Mali, said in French (he speaks little English) that everything he sold was from Africa except his medallions and cheap silver pieces shaped like the African continent.
"I get those from the Koreans downtown," Mr. Ahmed said. "We don't make things like that where I am from."
Some vendors make good money: Ray A. Wirt said he now earns more selling framed photos of people like Miles Davis and Martin Luther King Jr. than he did as an architect downtown. But Mr. Ahmed said that street life was unpredictable and often a hardship because he sends much of his earnings to his mother and two wives in Mali.
"Some days I make $50, sometimes I go home with not one dollar," he said. "It is up and down, very so-so. Who knows how much I will make each day? Only God."
The woman could not keep her hands off the glycerin soaps, the bath beads, the cute bottles of bubbly blue goop. What, she wondered in the sweet-smelling Body Shop, would rid her of the bumps that sprouted just above her brow?
"Do you use anything for the dead skin on your face?" asked John Boyd, the store's 25-year-old assistant manager. "Have you had any kind of change in your diet?"
"I've been eating more," the woman said absently, as she picked up yet another bottle. "Is this a bubble bath?"
It was in fact nonfoaming bath oil, a brackish green. Mr. Boyd, endlessly patient with fussy customers, said the Body Shop had already turned a small profit.
To many Harlem residents, the presence of the Body Shop and Ben & Jerry's is a sort of symbolic triumph. Not only have these major upscale chains come to Harlem, but Harlemites are buying.
"There are a lot of people shopping in this store who had shopped for years in Body Shops downtown," Mr. Boyd said. "I mean, it's about time."
Joseph H. Holland, 36, a Harvard Law School graduate, said people were skeptical when he decided to open a Ben & Jerry's franchise in Harlem. It is not wildly successful yet (he got a late start last summer), but he is optimistic.
"The feeling was these upscale shops are too pricey for 125th Street," he said. "That's just not true."
Like the Body Shop, Ben & Jerry's has come with a corporate philosophy that suits an area ravaged over the years by poverty and drugs. The ice-cream parlor is staffed by men from Harkhomes, a shelter and rehabilitation program Mr. Holland founded. There are scores of other projects planned, including Caldor and Pathmark, and community leaders hope that they will follow the same pattern of helping and hiring.
The idea of communal improvement along 125th Street seems tied to a notion of individual betterment. For years, Roberto Harden, 43, was a heroin addict who had a dozen assault and robbery convictions. Now, as the manager of Ben & Jerry's, he directs a staff of a dozen men, all learning new skills that have nothing to do with crime and drugs. Some cannot take the discipline. Others do well. Mr. Harden mentioned one constant frustration:
"They want to give out mounds of ice cream," he said. "They don't understand this is a business. They want to be too nice."
And though the parlor is decorated with the chain's usual emblem of cows grazing on a deep green field, it has touches of Harlem beyond its employees: it was renovated to look like an Harlem ice-cream parlor of the 1940's. And April's flavor of the month was concocted, in part, by Mr. Holland: Harlem Blues Berries, a mix of rasberry ice cream, blueberries and strawberries, is being served at the 92 Ben & Jerry's around the nation.
It's the flavor from here to San Diego to Maine.

HEADLINE: In Health Care Too, Price Controls Don't Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Clinton and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York should be informed that price controls on health care or anything else do not work. I know firsthand. In 1972 and 1973, during Richard M. Nixon Presidency, I was involved in developing price controls for the Cost of Living Council, the agency set up to control all prices. 
 The only positive thing to come out of the Nixon policies was to educate the nation that price controls are ineffective and actually exacerbate economic imbalances. They are a waste of time and taxpayer money. It appears these memories have dimmed.
Price controls don't work because:
* Black markets develop.
* The supply of goods and services is reduced.
* Government bureaucracy, regulation and "red tape" multiply to enforce controls. And no bureaucrat knows as much as the market knows.
* Market inefficiencies will be created as health care providers spend more time coping with regulations than serving the public.
I watched these inevitable effects take place in the 70's. Let's not make the same mistakes in the 90's.
The best way to set prices now, as it was then, is to let the market operate with the establishment of an equilibrium among many sellers and many buyers.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Taking on Iran and Iraq, but Separately

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE way the Clinton Administration sees it, if Iran's President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, were to take off his turban and his clerical robe, put on a uniform and grow a fuller, darker mustache, he might look a lot like Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein.
It is not that the new Administration cannot recognize the difference between the two leaders or the two countries. Mr. Hussein, a secular, totalitarian Arab leader, came to power by force and continues to rely on force to achieve his goals. Mr. Rafsanjani, an Islamic clergyman whose family runs the largest pistachio empire in Iran, was popularly elected -- albeit in a less than pristinely democratic contest -- and is running for re-election next month. Iraq runs on its terror; Iran runs despite its increasing anarchy. 
 Rather, the Clinton Administration views both leaders as dangerous men in charge of dangerous countries that do things that are inimical to American interests. Iran's baffling recent purchase of oil from its arch-enemy Iraq in violation of United Nations sanctions and Iraq's anti-aircraft fire last week directed at American fighter jets are but the most recent examples.
So how to deal with them? Past Administrations routinely looked at the two nations as players in a balancing act, historic rivals that could be -- and indeed had to be -- used against each other to insure that one did not become too strong at the expense of the other. During the war between the two countries in the 1980's, the prevailing view of the Reagan Administration was the one best articulated by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, that "both sides should lose."
Now the Clinton Administration argues that neither regime should be strengthened and that each should be dealt with as a separate problem -- a sort of parallel containment. In addition, Mr. Clinton, unlike President Bush, is more likely to use the behavior of the regimes, rather than the individual leaders themselves, as policy determinants. Mr. Clinton would neither be likely to label Mr. Hussein "worse than Hitler" nor inclined to pick up the phone in the mistaken belief that Mr. Rafsanjani was on the other end in Teheran, as Mr. Bush did.
But the new Administration has thus far failed to articulate a regional policy in a coherent and convincing way. Administration officials say they are abandoning the Bush fixation with Mr. Hussein, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher has branded Iran an "international outlaw," citing its support for terrorism abroad and its determination to develop a nuclear weapon. Framing the policy in that way leaves the unfortunate impression that Iraq is less and Iran is more of an enemy and that parallel containment may be just a reworked version of old-fashioned power balancing.
The Administration argues that the Bush emphasis on Mr. Hussein's ouster raised false hopes, created a gap between American goals and those laid out in tough Security Council sanctions and threatened to divide the American-led international coalition formed to confront Iraq. It has a convoluted explanation for its own policy: Mr. Hussein must comply with United Nations sanctions so tough that he could not possibly comply and still remain in power. In fact, the argument continues, the new approach is even tougher than the Bush policy, because it requires not only Mr. Hussein but also his successors to fulfill all United Nations resolutions.
But the policy glosses over the fact that in the Middle East, perception is often more important than reason. The subtlety of the new argument is bound to be lost on Mr. Hussein, who proved during the Persian Gulf crisis just how poor he was at reading American intentions.
"The Clinton people have to formulate the policy better," said Talib Shibib, an Iraqi opposition leader and ex-Foreign Minister. "It has been very confusing. Most people think that the Clinton people are softening. And we the opposition are losing support among the Iraqi people, who either want the lifting of the sanctions or the removal of Saddam."
As for Iran, the Clinton Administration has already decided that it remains a foreign policy mine field. Despite its help in winning the release of American hostages held by Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon, Iran has not improved its behavior, officials say. They cite its support for terrorism and for Islamic fundamentalist movements, its determination to rebuild its military, including the development of weapons of mass destruction, its poor human rights record and its opposition to the American-sponsored Middle East peace talks.
 
The Saddam Syndrome
 But the new Administration is looking at much the same behavior as the Bush Administration did, and reaching different conclusions. When Mr. Clinton concludes his current policy review on Iran, he is likely to abandon the "good will begets good will" approach of Mr. Bush, which left open the door for dialogue. The question is why?
First, there is the Saddam syndrome. The Administration is determined not to make the same mistakes with Iran that Mr. Bush did with Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait, trying to moderate behavior through economic and political incentives.
Second, the new Administration wants to move the Middle East peace talks forward, and feels that Iran's opposition as well as its support for terrorist groups opposed to the negotiations cannot go unpunished.
Third, the Clinton team is taking its cue from countries in the region. Israel, for example, sees Iran as the nuclear threat of the next decade -- a threat that helps justify Israel's own arms buildup and continued levels of American aid. And when Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, met with Mr. Clinton last week, he blamed Iran for much of the fundamentalist turmoil in his own country.
Fourth, the new Administration's most experienced diplomat in dealing with Iran is the Secretary of State himself. Mr. Christopher still bears the scars from his experiences with Iran in the Carter Administration, which suffered through the overthrow of its best friend in the Persian Gulf, Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi. As the chief American negotiator in winning the release of Americans held hostage by Iran's revolutionary regime, Mr. Christopher has no illusions about the Administration's ability to shape Iran's policy.
But this approach ignores the fact that the United States could do worse than coexist with an Iran led by Mr. Rafsanjani, by no means a Western-style democrat, but at least a pragmatic state-builder determined to rebuild his country's economy. He has proven that he is capable of responsible action: when he remained neutral in the gulf war with Iraq and again when he pressed for the release of American hostages in Lebanon.
"I still don't think the analysis of Rafsanjani as a pragmatist who wants to improve relations with the West is wrong," said Shaul Bakhash, a historian and author. "Yes, he is ultimately responsible for what Iranians do abroad, and this is no time for constructive engagement. But we don't want to make it any worse, and it will be much harder for Iranians to resume a policy of seeking dialogue after all this name-calling."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Jobs Plan Rallies the Republicans

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE tug of war between President Clinton and Senate Republicans over Mr. Clinton's proposed $19.5 billion economic stimulus package is about many things besides the pork barrels, loopholes and swimming pools supposedly in the package itself. It is about political body-building by Republicans getting ready for 1994. It is about the ambivalent mood of the country on the big economic issues and, as with almost everything in American politics today, it is about Ross Perot and how to steal his voters.
In some ways, Mr. Clinton has been a victim of his own success. The outlines of the larger $1.52 trillion budget package he announced last week -- consisting of long-term tax increases, new spending programs and defense cuts -- have breezed so easily through Congress so far that many Americans seemed to be ignoring the fight over the smaller job-stimulus plan, designed to give a shove to the current recovery. 
 "I think one reason that the public has not been engaged more is that it thinks Clinton has already won," said Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution, an expert on Congress. "But that is a political failure on Clinton's part. He is suffering a public relations defeat on a secondary issue, when he has been winning the larger battle."
Senate Republicans successfully entrapped the stimulus package in a filibuster, forcing the President to seek a compromise that will take some of their demands for spending cuts into account. But this was not only a public relations blunder growing out of a bit of hubris at the White House. The public's silence over the Republican filibuster also stems from the voters' ambivalence, or confusion, about the whole concept of a stimulus package, which calls for spending more billions now on roads, bridges and other projects to create jobs, preceding a $1.52 trillion budget that calls for more taxes and spending cuts. There is a logic to all this, but it does not fit on a bumper sticker.
Indeed, if to name something is to own it, how this stimulus package is named will determine a lot about which party ends up owning it. Will it be called a jobs bill or a pork barrel bill? Will it be seen as "action," the opposite of which is "gridlock," or as "business as usual," the opposite of which is "change"?
Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, a Republican back in his home district last week, reported: "I saw one headline that said, 'Republicans Hold Up Jobs Bill.' When you paint the issue that way, the public is not sympathetic to the Republicans. Then the other day I saw another headline: 'Republicans Try to Stop Administration on New Spending.' With that vocabulary, the Republicans look pretty good. All of this reflects the public's ambivalent mood: It wants more programs and less taxes."
But this battle was also training for future political combat. In trying to show that they have the muscle to force the President to compromise on an essential element of his economic program, the Republican leaders were trying to make sure that he would not be able to ignore their views in the looming battles on health care and welfare reform, let alone the big budget.
That new 1,478-page Clinton budget for 1994 proposes tax increases on energy, Social Security benefits, corporate profits and personal income in higher brackets, along with spending reductions including $108 billion in military and civilian programs.
What the Republicans have done with the stimulus package is to show that it has loose threads, like swimming pools for poor neighborhoods, that can be tugged for political gain. Even some Democrats have defected on another central element of the plan, the investment tax credit, which is likely to hasten its unraveling.
And there are more loose threads in a $1.52 trillion budget. The real danger for Mr. Clinton is that what is happening on the stimulus package will happen to the larger budget: that it will be defined by its parts rather than by the whole.
"The more concessions Clinton has to make on the stimulus package," said the Republican political consultant Kevin Phillips, "the more he is made to look like just another wheeler-dealer, the more chance there will be unraveling on the larger budget. When you start to get threads pulled on you, people all of a sudden start to say, 'Hey, look, this is coming loose.' "
 
Recalling Ross Perot
 Republicans are clearly betting that their stance will draw the Perot voters they will need for a comeback. As Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole told CNN last week: "I think we'd like to bring them back to the Republican Party. We believe our philosophy is pretty much what they voted for when they voted for Ross Perot last November -- they want less spending, less regulation."
No doubt casting the Democrats as tied in with special interests and pork, and incapable of turning the economy around, is a way to appeal to Perot voters. But there is a risk here. The more Perotism is made an issue, the more people may seek the real thing, not a Republican imitation. "Clinton will succeed with Perot voters, if he succeeds in governing," said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's polltaker. "Republicans will succeed if they make themselves an effective opposition. But to do that they need an alternative Republican vision, and there is no sign of that yet. By constantly referencing Perot, the Republicans may enlarge Perot at their own expense."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT IS URGED TO CONSIDER FORCE TO HELP BOSNIANS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON with STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
A team of experts sent to Bosnia by President Clinton to assess the plight of civilians caught in the fighting has urged Washington to give serious consideration to military intervention to end the suffering.
In a draft report, the group recommended that the Administration consider civilian "safe havens" protected by international forces and stronger military action to both insure the delivery of aid and silence the heavy artillery Serbian forces have used to shell besieged cities. 
 But at the instruction of senior officials, the group withheld recommendations on the use of force -- which run counter to current Administration policy -- from Congress in closed-door briefings that took place this week.
 
White House Is Silent
 A White House official refused to say if President Clinton had been informed about the team's conclusions.
An executive summary of the draft report, prepared in March, was obtained by The New York Times from an official who believes the material should be part of the public debate on policy toward the crisis. The group's findings question the fundamental premise of the West's approach in Bosnia, which has been to deliver food to Muslim towns and cities shelled by Bosnian Serbs while refraining from using force to protect the civilians.
The 26-member team said the main threat to Bosnian civilians is not starvation but attacks by Bosnian Serbs on populated areas, which have killed and wounded civilians and forced them to flee through mountainous terrain in sub-zero temperatures. Under such circumstances, United Nations deliveries of food and supplies were doing little to address the real cause of suffering, the team found.
The team's members included State Department and military officials, relief experts from the Agency for International Development and doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
 
A Call for 'Safe Havens'
 "Even the best humanitarian program," their summary states, "will be of limited utility as long as more direct or forceful means are not applied to end the conflict itself or, at least, to shift its focus away from the civilian population."
Their proposal to consider creating "safe havens," in which Western military power would be used to protect civilians, has stirred consternation at high levels of the Clinton Administration because it implies the use of ground troops and the use of air power to deter Serbian attacks.
The team's report comes as the Clinton Administration has reached a crossroads on its Bosnia policy. With Bosnian Serbs adamantly refusing to sign a peace accord, and their attacks on civilians continuing, the Clinton Administration is struggling over what to do next.
Senior Administration officials acknowledged that they ordered the omission of the recommendations on force in the briefings to House and Senate committees.
In explaining the decision to withhold the team's key conclusions, one top Administration official said that the recommendations were meant for internal review and that the experts had been sent to assess the needs for relief in Bosnia, not propose new policies on military intervention.
But another official insisted that the team had a broad mandate and that the cool response to its views by the State Department and National Security Council amounted to "a shoot the messenger approach."
The State Department has not decided how much, if any, of the material will be made public.
 
 
Mission Returned March 11
 The team's mission was announced by Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Feb. 10 as part of a package of measures President Clinton had approved to stem the bloodshed. Mr. Christopher said the team was to "urgently" search for means of easing the suffering of the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Bosnia.
Two weeks later, the team led by Hugh G. Hamilton, deputy adviser for East European assistance at the State Department, arrived in Bosnia and interviewed aid workers, refugees and others with direct knowledge of the conflict. They returned to Washington on March 11 and summarized their findings in a draft report.
The team, in its draft proposing ways to ease the suffering, said "safe havens" could protect Bosnian civilians who were being shelled or at risk of being attacked. "This process should focus on areas being subjected to purposeful shelling of local populations and nonmilitary targets, and infers a willingness to protect those safe havens," the summary noted.
While the team urged serious consideration of this idea, a Pentagon member of the group reportedly expressed reservations, reflecting Defense Department concerns about being drawn into the fighting in Bosnia.
 
Supplies Called Critical
 In another of its recommendations, the team suggested that the Administration encourage and assist the United Nations in opening the airport in Tuzla, a city in eastern Bosnia that the team said would be swamped with refugees if nearby enclaves fell to attacking Serbian forces. Refugees fleeing the advancing Bosnian Serbs have already been evacuated to Tuzla, which is under Muslim control.
Delivering supplies to the town, the report noted, was also critical because the city produces coal and plays a key role in "what remains" of the economy in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The report also suggested that experts in communications and logistics from the Pentagon and Agency for International Development help the United Nations peacekeepers and refugee officials in Bosnia. American military doctors and relief workers from the Agency for International Development should be sent to improve medical care, the report said.
"Short of stopping attacks on civilian populations, these steps will save the greatest number of innocent lives," the summary said.
Among the members of the assessment team was Dr. Michael Toole of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who visited the besieged town of Zepa, in eastern Bosnia.
 
'It Was Unbelievably Cold'
 Dr. Toole said in a telephone interview that an examination of records showed that in the past year, the death rate had increased fourfold. The records said 40 to 45 percent died of wounds inflicted by the fighting and that about 40 percent had died of hunger.
"It was unbelievably cold," Dr. Toole said. "The people of Zepa looked tired, exhausted, and hungry but not critically malnourished."
The Clinton Administration's handling of the assessment is in some ways a case study of the inner workings of Washington, illustrating how the executive branch can use its control over the machinery of government to shape public debate.
Although President Clinton said during the Presidential campaign that he advocated the use of force to halt Serbian aggression, he now seems to view that option as imprudent and impractical. His aides appear to be doing what they can to defuse pressure for intervention from either Congress or the public by withholding the team's recommendations from lawmakers, much as the Bush Administration did initially by downplaying reports on Serbian detention centers.
 
Suppression Is Denied
 "Folks are not in a 'let the chips fall where they may mode,' " an Administration official said. "Individual policymakers do not want any more pressure brought to bear on them than they already have."
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, denied that the Administration was suppressing the team's findings by withholding the recommendations from lawmakers.
"It is inaccurate to suggest that there is anything unusual about the Administration wanting to follow through on its own deliberations before briefing parties outside the Administration, whether on Capitol Hill or elsewhere, on the status of those issues," Mr. Boucher said.
Administration officials said the draft report was still being revised.
"They're putting a lot of pressure on," said an official, referring to the State Department's review of the draft report. "It's not like they're trying to kill it, it's more like 'Tone it down.' "
 
Criticism of Team Ignored
 Despite criticism that the team has overstepped its mandate, the latest revision of the March draft still includes military action as among the recommended options because the team believes force is needed to save lives. Administration officials said the latest version of the draft calls on the Clinton Administration to consider the creation of "safe havens," and the use of force to insure the delivery of relief supplies and to knock out artillery.
The revised draft report is also said to include these recommendations:
*Station United Nations peacekeeping troops in or near contested areas to deter fighting.
*Develop punitive measures that will persuade Serbian leaders in Bosnia and Serbia to permit food aid to reach besieged communities.
*Insist that the Government of Croatia take similar steps to assure that Croatian soldiers in Bosnia "cease harassment of Muslim civilians and relief operations."
*Deliver seeds to the Bosnians so that they grow some of their own food.
*Help establish a radio station in Bosnia so that civilians can learn what is happening in their own country.
*Continue the airdrop of relief supplies over Bosnia.
*Help repair power plants and improve coal production.
Representative Frank McCloskey, the Indiana Democrat who is one of the few voices in Congress calling for American involvement in Bosnia, said the decision to withhold the recommendations came as no surprise.
"The Administration has totally backed away from the idea of doing anything significant to stop the slaughter," Mr. McCloskey said.
 
 
 
BALKAN UPDATE
 A team the Administration sent to BOSNIA is recommending that Washington consider military intervention to create civilian "safe havens" and is seeking stronger military action to silence the heavy artillery of Serbian forces and insure that aid reaches civilians.
United Nations officials said yesterday that they feared that Bosnian Serbs, emboldened by recent events, might be planning to tighten their noose around SREBRENICA and mount a tank offensive in an attempt to seize parts of SARAJEVO.
Bosnian Muslims in SREBRENICA once again blocked the evacuation of refugees on a United Nations convoy. Local officials have blocked mass evacuations for fear they would leave the town vulnerable to assault.
United Nations aid flights to SARAJEVO were suspended after reports that Serbs placed anti-aircraft guns near the airport.
In ZAGREB, Iran's parliamentary leader said TEHERAN would supply Muslims with weapons if the arms embargo was lifted.
 Two French peacekeepers were killed when their gasoline tanker overturned near BIHAC in northwest Bosnia on Friday, an army spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Drop the Mop, Bless the Mess: The Decline of Housekeeping

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
Dust bunnies under the couch. Cobwebs in the corners. A grimy shellac over the contents of kitchen cupboards. In a culture where cleanliness has long been equated with godliness, these telltale signs should be anathema. But rather than repenting with a vigorous spring cleaning, many Americans are changing creeds.
"I'll never be the housekeeper my mother is, and I've made peace with that," said Kristen Jaeger, whose family owns a winery in Napa Valley, Calif. "Of course, my mother isn't the housekeeper her mother was. My grandmother used to take Lysol to hotel rooms and clean before she unpacked." 
 The decline of cleanliness seems to prick the nation's Spic and Span conscience. Home economists and representatives of the cleaning-products industry refer euphemistically to the rise of dirt and dust on the domestic scene. "I'd prefer to say that modern homemakers are reprioritizing," said Carolyn Forte, associate director of the Good Housekeeping Institute in New York, the magazine's research group. Others are blunter and advocate accepting reality.
 
'Better Things to Do'
 "Bless the mess," said Mary Ellen Pinkham, whose housecleaning advice column is syndicated in 150 newspapers. While she maintains white-glove standards in her own home, she believes this level of cleanliness is rapidly becoming an anomaly.
"The American home is getting dirtier," she said. "People have better things to do with their time than clean."
Housekeeping standards have dipped strikingly in the last five years, in the opinion of executives with moving companies, maid services and extermination businesses in New York, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati and San Francisco. The professionals who regularly enter private homes say the change cuts across socioeconomic lines but is most evident in households with young children and two working parents.
Such couples seem able to maintain a tidy facade, but a closer look reveals that neither Mr. Clean nor the White Tornado have visited in years.
"You walk into a fancy house, everything looks tidy, and then you move the couch and pull up enough dust to give you asthma," said Tom Davis, the vice president of Mini Moves, a 30-year-old moving company in Cincinnati. "Move a refrigerator, and you're looking at a third-world nation."
Lack of time, more than a slothful nature, accounts for the decline in spotlessness, said Dr. Juliet Schorr, a professor of economics at Harvard University and the author of "The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure" (Basic Books, 1992). Studying time-use diaries of 1,000 Americans, she found that for every hour a woman works outside the home, she cuts back 30 minutes of housekeeping time.
Men pick up some of the slack in cleaning time, but not all of it, said John Robinson, the director of the Survey Research Center of the University of Maryland in College Park. Also studying time-use data, he found that in 1985, women spent about an hour and a half less cleaning house each week than they did in 1965. In the same period, men devoted about an hour more to cleaning, which left a 30-minute void for dust to grow.
 
Ever More Dirt
 According to a telephone survey of 500 adults, released by Black & Decker last week, the discrepancy -- and the dust -- have grown. Forty-three percent of the women surveyed said they were doing less housecleaning than they had done five years ago, but only 21 percent felt their husbands were contributing more than they had in 1987.
"It's easier to cut back on scrubbing the floor than it is to cut back on child care, laundry or meal preparation," Dr. Schorr said.
But can a country admonished by the antiseptic precepts of "Beeton's Book of Household Management," first published in 1861, make peace with scrubbing, mopping, dusting and polishing left undone? Certainly a fear of the "discomfort and suffering" that Isabella Beeton found inherent in "untidy ways," must linger.
 
'People Get Depressed'
 Of course, it does, said Martha Stewart, the cooking, gardening and entertaining doyenne, who discusses the decline in cleaning habits in her book, "Home Keeping," to be published next year by Clarkson N. Potter. "People get depressed when they can't see out their windows," she added.
Mrs. Pinkham, the columnist, said that the depressing effects of hidden dirt had resulted in a fanaticism for clean counter tops among the generation raised to expect tidiness a la June Cleaver.
"They try to project perfect housekeeping by being maniacs about appearance," she said. "Meanwhile, their closets are full of stuff they've been dragging around since Gerald Ford was President."
 
Sales of Deodorizers Gain
 George Rosenbaum, an analyst at Leo J. Shapiro, a market-research organization in Chicago, said that after a decade of disappointing sales in floor-care products and all-purpose cleaners, the cleaning-products industry evidenced gains last year, particularly in the sale of surface cleaners, many in spray bottles, and carpet and bathroom deodorizers.
"There's a boon in combined products, the detergent with bleach, the glass cleaner that can double as a counter cleaner, the bath gel that also eliminates tub rings and deodorizes," he said. Such multipurpose products, he added, seem to promise time saving as well as a tidy appearance.
Ham Carson, the editor of Household and Personal Products Industry, a monthly trade journal known by its acronym, Happi, said, "People are less the proverbial Dutch housewives, down on their hands and knees scrubbing, but they're eager for convenience and quick cleans."
Whether felled by the limits of time or the extinction of elbow-grease, Americans are increasingly employing maids and cleaning services to use the cleaning products they buy.
 
More Housekeeping Services
 In Manhattan alone, the number of businesses listed under the "Housekeeping," heading in the Nynex Yellow Pages has jumped to 51 in the current directory from 34 in 1983, said Patrick Marshall, a sales agent for the directory. And across the country, businesses are diversifying to include cleaning services. Orkin, the pest-control company, for example, recently formed a housecleaning subsidiary in Atlanta, where the company has its headquarters.
"We're noticing home-improvement stores and even grocery stores offering maid services," Mr. Rosenbaum said. In response, cleaning services like Maids Unlimited Citywide in New York, one of the oldest cleaning services in the country, have added "general handyman services," said the company's president, Van Lederer.
Blurring the lines between housecleaning and home maintenance is more than a marketing tool. It also reflects how some wealthy households contend with a buildup of deep-down dirt that seems to elude maids.
 
Don't Clean; Paint
 "Many of our clients renovate more frequently," said Jerry Caldari, a partner in Bromley & Caldari, a New York architectural firm. "One told me that a new coat of paint eats the dust mites."
Iris Kaplan, an artist, found it daunting to maintain a plush Park Avenue apartment when she returned to her painting full time. "All that chintz, those drapes, those curving wood surfaces," she said. "Well, I decided you won't have dusty drapes if you don't have drapes." Five years ago, she turned her apartment into a sleek, wall-less loft, with easily cleaned marble and stainless-steel surfaces.
"Nothing touches the floor, so a maid with a mop can keep the place spotless in two hours a week," Mrs. Kaplan said. "It's easier to knock down a wall than to clean a wall."
This striking response to domestic dirt and dust is endorsed by home mavens like Ms. Stewart and Mrs. Pinkham. "I'm not trying to be the new Mrs. Beeton and create work," Ms. Stewart said. "I advocate practicality before elbow grease."
 
'An Outmoded Notion'
 Likewise, Mrs. Pinkham's seventh book, "Mary Ellen's Clean House!" (Crown), written with Dale Burg and scheduled to be issued later this month, would certainly have caused the good Mrs. Beeton to fear a heathen invasion and reach for the smelling salts. "I've suggested shortcuts that get the job done well enough," Mrs. Pinkham said. "Perfection in housecleaning is an outmoded notion."
Those guilt stricken at their own reluctance to scour corners, beat rugs and squeegee windows might find Dr. Peggy Meszaros's analysis useful. Dr. Meszaros, the dean of human and environmental sciences at the University of Kentucky in Lexington and president-elect of the American Home Economics Association, said that today a spotless home is a better reason for guilt than free-ranging dust bunnies are.
"In a time-pressured society, the prudent homemaker should make a priority of the people who make the home, their children and spouses, rather than making the physical structure of the home top priority," she said. "Assuming, of course, that the kitchen and bathroom still get cleaned."

HEADLINE: Japan Weighs Aid to Russia Against an Old Feud

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 10

 BODY:
When Japan announced this week that the Russian Foreign Minister would attend next week's meeting of senior officials from the wealthiest industrial nations, the news set off a furious debate among Government officials here. The issue was not how democracy could be fostered in Russia, but whether Japan would be able to use the visit to press Moscow to return a group of islands seized at the close of World War II.
The chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, first said the territorial issue would not be raised, since the point of the meeting is to provide financial support for the programs of the beleaguered Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin. But later Mr. Kono abruptly changed course, saying the long-sought northern islands might be discussed when the Japanese and Russian foreign ministers meet separately. 
 It was a revealing moment in what is proving to be a remarkably difficult process for the policymakers in Tokyo. Japan is chairman and host of the conference, which will bring together the foreign and finance ministers of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. The meeting will not only discuss an increase in the West's role in Russia's struggle to build a market economy, but could also prove a milestone in Japan's efforts to gain an influence in international affairs equal to its economic might.
But the dispute with Russia over the bleak, lightly populated islands, part of the Kurile chain, is tying Government officials in knots as they struggle to balance a nationalistic urge to limit aid to Russia until the islands are returned with a desire to be seen as cooperating with Western aid efforts.
The effort to strike that balance seems to be leaving no one here happy. Under heavy pressure from the other countries in the Group of Seven, the Government has all but abandoned its policy of linking financial assistance with progress on the islands questions. But Japan is also afraid of acknowledging a change in policy for fear that such an admission will give away any leverage it has over Russia.
 
No Linkage Is Asserted
 "We have never said that we have separated the Northern Territories issue and aid," insisted one senior Foreign Ministry official last week, referring to the disputed Kuriles. "But they are not linked."
The total aid package to be worked out here next week is expected to come to more than $25 billion, and Japan may be pressed to contribute as much as $3 billion in direct aid. Several billion dollars of the new package will simply be funds promised a year ago that were never disbursed because of the economic disarray in Russia.
Whether Western leaders like it or not, the territorial issue will thus be important for them, too, because even if the islands are not discussed here they are having an impact on how much aid the Japanese will provide.
For instance, Japan is pushing for most of the money to be channeled through multilateral institutions, like the International Monetary Fund, rather than as bilateral aid. Japanese officials also express reservations about providing aid that would benefit the military, such as the construction of housing for Russian soldiers returning from former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe.
In addition, Japanese officials say they favor policies that would benefit Russia by bringing it foreign currency earnings through trade rather than giveaways. This might involve targeting aid to specific industries so Russia could profit from self-sustaining commercial operations, and then use that capital to finance other businesses.
Any discussion of aid for Russia with Japanese officials usually begins with an angry description of what they regard as the injustice of Moscow's seizure of the islands at the end of World War II and of the more than 60,000 Japanese who died in Soviet detention camps afterwards. The Kuriles were ceded to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference and occupied by Soviet troops in September 1945, a month after the Japanese surrender.
Japanese officials also complain that they are sometimes wrongly accused of having given little at all to Russia. Japan committed $2.7 billion last year. Of that about $700 million has been disbursed, and another $400 million to $500 million will be disbursed shortly, officials said, which is in line with other donor nations.
These commitments were calculated with enormous care, a senior Foreign Ministry official explained, to place Japan squarely in the middle of the nations giving aid to Russia, at a level high enough to avoid criticism but low enough to let Moscow know that Tokyo could do more if the islands were returned.
"The political solution over the islands and the economic assistance should be balanced," said Sozaburo Okamatsu, head of trade policy at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. "But the huge assistance should come after solution of the territorial issue."
 
What's More Important?
 Western countries have said they generally support Japan's aim of regaining the islands, but they clearly have little sympathy for the idea of making aid contingent on the issue when the future of a nuclear-armed Russia hangs in the balance.
It is not clear that the Japanese people support a linkage either. There is a vocal minority that feels strongly about the islands, and polls show people generally feel the territory should be returned. But many editorials here have condemned the Government for what they say are its inflexible methods and lack of statesmanship.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Scale Down Program to Oust Iraqi Leader

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has concluded that the Bush Administration's covert program to overthrow Saddam Hussein has failed to weaken the Iraqi leader, but it plans to maintain a scaled-down version of the program anyway, Administration and other Government officials say.
In reviewing the program, the new Administration has concluded that much of the aid has been misdirected to groups with no popular following, and that too much money has been spent on leaflets and other propaganda devices that have had little impact, the officials said. They added that the Administration would try to make less money do more in trying to destabilize the Iraqi Government and make life more difficult for Mr. Hussein. 
 The expected changes in the Iraqi program, which is run by the Central Intelligence Agency, are part of an ambitious and systematic review of all of the covert programs that the Clinton Administration inherited from the Bush Administration, the officials said.
The decision to continue the secret program despite misgivings about its effectiveness reflects conflicting pressures on the Administration.
 
Different Emphasis Hinted
 On the one hand, senior Administration officials have said that President George Bush's demonization of Mr. Hussein by labeling him "worse than Hitler" was foolish because it raised expectations that he would have to be overthrown even though the United States did not have the tools to do it.
On the other hand, even as the new officials seek to "depersonalize" Iraq policy by focusing on the importance of Iraq's compliance with United Nations sanctions, the Administration is sensitive to charges that it is being soft on Mr. Hussein.
A result has been a sometimes confusing mix of new signals and status quo. While officials hint at a different emphasis, they have left in place many of the specific decisions, like the rules of engagement for American pilots enforcing the no-flight zone. These rules led jets to drop bombs on Iraqi antiaircraft batteries on Friday after the pilots said the batteries had opened fire.
Administration officials are reluctant to discuss the covert program to oust Mr. Hussein, citing its secret nature. But in classified briefings with the C.I.A., some lawmakers are said to have asked why they should approve money for a program that has no chance of succeeding.
"As far as I'm concerned, it's a let's-throw-money-and-hope-it-works approach," said one lawmaker, who says the program should be reorganized.
 
$40 Million Plan Last Year
 President Bush harbored the hope that the Iraqi military could be encouraged to foment a coup against Mr. Hussein, and toward the end of 1991, several months after the Persian Gulf war ended, he authorized a $15 million covert plan to help oust him. Last year, the program was expanded to $40 million, after a number of lawmakers argued forcefully that the United States had made only a halfhearted effort against the Iraqi leader.
Officials said that the Clinton Administration might cut the $40 million program by about half, although they emphasized that no final budget decision had been made.
The secret program has financed opposition groups inside and outside Iraq, propaganda by clandestine radio stations, leaflets and a disinformation campaign inside the country. Several groups receive money.
The longstanding Congressional ban on trying to assassinate a foreign leader precludes direct American involvement in any plot to kill Mr. Hussein.
Almost from the time that the gulf war ended, C.I.A. analysts have argued that economic sanctions alone are unlikely to weaken Mr. Hussein. In the last two years, he has been able to rebuild much of the country's highways, bridges, electrical and communications networks and other installations. To a large extent, he has sheltered his military from the sanctions, which continue to hurt the Iraqi people.
 
A Hard Man to Dislodge
 These intelligence analysts have held to the position that it would be unlikely that anything short of an assassination would dislodge Mr. Hussein from power.
Even the Bush Administration had few illusions that the covert program would lead to Mr. Hussein's overthrow. In briefing members of Congress about the plan to expand the program last May, Bush Administration officials did not claim that American opposition contacts were capable of overthrowing Mr. Hussein or even that they were well placed, officials said.
The intelligence agencies of the United States and other Western governments have had little success in penetrating Iraqi society. Despite the presence of American troops in restricted no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq, American intelligence officials have acknowledged that the United States has little direct knowledge of or contacts with Mr. Hussein's inner circle, the Iraqi military and the intelligence services.
In an interview with The Washington Post in January, Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, said an effort to oust Mr. Hussein had come "pretty close" last summer. It failed, he said, only because the Iraqi leader "has one of the most efficient systems in the world." Mr. Scowcroft added that the coup attempt, which he suggested involved the Iraqi military, had not been an American effort. rule

IRAQ AGAIN DENIES ATTACK
 WASHINGTON, April 10 (AP) -- Iraq denied again today that its troops had fired on American warplanes patrolling its northern region and accused the United States of having attacked a tourist site to scare civilians.
On Friday, American jet fighters bombed Iraqi antiaircraft batteries in the northern no-flight zone, which is patrolled by the United States to insure that Iraqi planes in the Kurdish region remain grounded. Clinton Administration officials said the Iraqi installations had provoked the air raid by firing on the American planes.

Serbian forces pressed closer to Srebrenica today and intensified assaults on the capital, deepening concern among United Nations officials that the Serbs may think they can resume all-out "ethnic cleansing" without fear of serious international reprisals.
Other officials familiar with Western intelligence reports said they feared that Serbian nationalists might be planning a tank offensive to seize parts of Sarajevo. 
 The United Nations suspended the Western aid airlift this morning after military observers spotted potentially threatening movements by Serbian truck-borne antiaircraft batteries immediately beneath the approach to the airport, a United Nations official said.
Comdr. Barry Frewer, the United Nations military spokesman, denied that account. He attributed the suspension to apprehension among the air forces flying the airlift that they would become targets of Serbian gunners prepared for patrols that are to begin on Monday to enforce the no-flight zone over Bosnia.
Two developments in recent days appear to have encouraged the Serbian leaders to press ahead. Although the idea of using force is still under debate in Washington, the Bosnian Serbs apparently have concluded that the threat of American military intervention, or even a serious tightening of economic sanctions, is receding.
 
Hidden Ammunition Found
 And on Thursday, Serbian troops discovered ammunition hidden in a United Nations relief truck carrying flour to a Sarajevo suburb controlled by the Muslim-led Bosnian Government.
Later, United Nations officials uncovered more ammunition and sacks of what they described as "gunpowder" in relief containers outside the United Nations warehouse at the airport, in an area where local Serbian and Muslim employees move freely.
As a United Nations investigation began, Gen. Manojlo Milanovic, a senior Serbian officer, sent a letter warning that Serbian forces would halt all convoys and open all packages, further delaying deliveries that already spend days at Serbian roadblocks.
"We know that supplying Muslims and Croats with weapons and ammunition has been done for a long time," General Milanovic said. "All this has been done with your approval. You have not respected our tolerance and our previous warnings."
 Serbian commanders say that, in effect, the Serbian forces reserve the right to shut down all relief efforts here, a move that would quickly starve many of the Muslim cities and towns that survive.
Relief convoys from the Croatian coast to Sarajevo, 180 miles away, have been halted since the Serbian troops discovered the ammunition in the truck of flour.
Senior United Nations officials say the prospects now are for a spring and summer of intensified assaults by Serbian forces in an effort to seize control of territory from Bosnia.
This grim prospect, at a time when Serbian leaders are being pressed to accept a peace plan that has already been signed by the Bosnian Government, representing Muslims, and by leaders of Bosnia's Croatian minority, appears to have come closer to reality with a series of aggressive Serbian military moves in recent days.
 
Pressure on Srebrenica Grows
 Among these has been the growing Serbian pressure on Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, where Serbian forces have defied their own commanders' repeated promises to observe a cease-fire, and calls by the Security Council for a halt to their attacks, by pushing forward ever closer to the town.
Although the Serbian military commander promised on Friday that his troops would stop their attacks on Srebrenica and its outlying Muslim villages at 2 P.M. today, the small peacekeeping detachment in the enclave reported that a volley of Serbian mortar fire struck close to a storage building 20 minutes after the Serbian deadline, and that Serbian bombardments elsewhere in the enclave continued past dusk.
Commander Frewer, the United Nations spokesman, told reporters: "The area under Bosnian control continues to be squeezed. It's getting smaller every day."
After driving hundreds of thousands of Muslims out of regions that have been their homes for centuries, the Serbian leaders have recently made it plain that they want to eliminate Muslims around Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde.
On Thursday, Serbian commanders allowed, or possibly encouraged, hundreds of Serbian civilians to halt two United Nations armored vehicles carrying Lieut. Gen. Philippe Morillon, the United Nations military commander in Bosnia, as they headed for Srebrenica from Sarajevo.
The civilians tore radio aerials and other equipment off the vehicles, and scrawled "Morillon-Hitler" and other abusive messages on the vehicles, before Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Serbian military commander, arrived at the scene in a Serbian military helicopter and suggested that Gen. Morillon follow the helicopter out of the area, away from Srebrenica.
On Friday, after General Morillon had made a 700-mile journey by land and air to skirt Serbian-controlled territory in Bosnia and reach Belgrade, he met General Mladic again, this time at a meeting arranged by the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, only to have General Mladic declare he would not tolerate any further attempts to intervene in the Srebrenica fighting.
Asked by reporters for his response to General Morillon's demands that 150 Canadian troops be stationed in Srebrenica as a United Nations "tripwire" against the fall of the town, General Mladic replied, "Over my dead body, and the bodies of my family."
Although General Morillon has been an opponent of Western military intervention against the Serbian forces, his stand at Srebrenica, where he hoisted the United Nations flag last month and promised to save the town from the Serbian forces, has infuriated Serbian leaders, who have demanded his removal from the United Nations command.
Reports in French newspapers in Paris today suggested that the French Government might be about to withdraw the commander, but General Morillon, returning to Sarajevo after the abortive Belgrade talks, told reporters that there was no truth to the reports.
"I have a job to do here, and I will be remaining on the ground here to do it," he said.
The only concession Serbian forces have made to United Nations pressures on Srebrenica to permit convoys to enter the enclave with limited amounts of food and medical supplies, and to carry Muslim residents of the enclave on the outbound journey across the siege lines to the Bosnian-held city of Tuzla, 50 miles away.
This two-way traffic, which has resulted in the evacuation of about 6,500 of the 60,000 people living in the enclave in the past three weeks, was to have resumed today, but Bosnian commanders in Srebrenica surrounded nine United Nations trucks with armed soldiers and refused to allow a large crowd of desperate Muslim civilians to board the trucks.
United Nations officials said that the Bosnian officers had explained their action by saying that they were not prepared to allow those seeking evacuation to travel aboard open trucks, as they did on previous convoys out of the enclave, which resulted in the deaths of at least 13 of the people packed onto the flatbeds of the trucks in below freezing temperatures.
But United Nations officials said they believed the real reason for halting today's planned evacuation was that Bosnian commanders fear that reducing the population will weaken the town's claim on the conscience of Western governments that might intervene against the Serbian forces.
"They used the uncovered trucks as an excuse," John McMillan, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in Sarajevo.
The Serbs have also made a crucial move against Gorazde by cutting the mountain trail that has been used by Bosnian forces for horse-borne convoys of food and weapons that have sustained the city.
And increasingly, United Nations officials say they believe that seizing part, or even most, of Sarajevo is part of the plan.
 
Ammunition Stocks Built Up
 Although Serbian artillery bombardments of Sarajevo have been sharply reduced during the cease-fire, people familiar with Western intelligence reports say that the lull has been used to build up stocks of ammunition at gun batteries overlooking the Bosnian capital, and that Serbian military commanders have drawn up plans for a new attempt soon to seize strategic territory around Sarajevo airport. These sources say that an advance of only a few hundred yards around one critical highway overpass would put the Serbian forces in a position to mount a tank offensive into the heart of the city.
Planes reaching their artillery batteries around Sarajevo have continued to fire into the city, although at much lower levels of bombardment than in the past.

HEADLINE: President's Budget Plans Worry Some Scientists

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
President Clinton's $1.52 trillion budget package, sent to Congress on Thursday, recommended a modest 4.1 percent overall increase in Federal financing of American science. Much of it was earmarked for programs that would stimulate technology and seek medical cures, however, and many scientists fear that the White House initiative will bleed off financial support for basic research.
Mr. Clinton's budget has yet to pass through the Congressional gantlet, and Congress seems certain to introduce major revisions, but many scientists are already scrutinizing the President's request for indications of the new Administration's priorities. 
 The most conspicuous of these is Mr. Clinton's proposal to increase spending for programs that produce technological applications that can improve the economy and public health.
But to accommodate these application-oriented programs, the kinds of research that have no immediate practical use, like particle physics or astronomy, will be held back. The Administration has recommended an increase of only 3 percent for such basic research in the civilian sector -- an increase that barely keeps pace with inflation -- and a cut of 11 percent for basic military research.
 
Some Worry About Restraints
 Some scientists worry that by being too specific about research goals, the Administration and Congress may inadvertently block great discoveries that come from freedom in experimentation. Serendipitous discovery, they say, is possible only for the scientist who is not constrained to follow too structured a research path.
Others were optimistic. "Reactions among scientists to President Clinton's science program are generally very cheerful," said Dr. Leon M. Lederman, a Nobel laureate in physics who has been president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for the last year.
But he noted that there were some proposals with "undercurrents" that might be enacted at the cost of basic scientific research. Among these are the proposal for the National Science Foundation, the nation's premier science financing agency, which would receive $3.2 billion in 1994, a 7.2 percent increase from the budget for the 1993 fiscal year for overall research financing, including both basic and applied research. Many American scientists have expressed satisfaction that Mr. Clinton intends to back the foundation strongly. But some have misgivings about the way grants will have to be spent.
The spending plans might "tend to convert the N.S.F. into a quick-fix agency," Dr. Lederman said. "That kind of thing has been tried before, and it was a disaster. But I believe the N.S.F. will survive the onslaught, once things settle down. The Administration doesn't yet have enough people on board to sort things out, but President Clinton's general views seem reasonable and favorable to science."
 
Focus on Certain Diseases
 Another major granting agency, the National Institutes of Health, will increase spending on the search for cures of certain diseases, notably breast cancer, AIDS and ailments that afflict minorities, while holding its overall budget to a 3 percent increase over the present year. Among the losers in such a budget would be research programs dealing with heart disease and strokes.
An official of the health institutes, who agreed to comment only on the condition that his name not be disclosed, said the cuts had been worked out by the agency itself, not by the Administration. "We were confronted with a need to reduce overall expenses while adding some new priorities," he said, "and within the constraints, we did the best we could."
The Clinton proposal includes substantial increases in financing for such practical research fields as materials science, a shift that pleases many applied-science researchers. Materials science is a field that includes the development of new building materials, materials with novel electronic or optical properties, special acoustical materials and many other substances regarded as essential to keeping American technology competitive with that of other countries.
In recent years many materials scientists have complained of low financing that they said was forced on them because of large Federal appropriations for such basic research programs as the superconducting supercollider, the $8.4-billion proton accelerator being built in Texas.
The future of the supercollider, which is strongly supported by the Clinton Administration, may depend partly on winning support from materials scientists.
 
'Circle Their Wagons'
 Dr. Robert Park, a spokesman for the American Physical Society, said an official of the Department of Energy had recently met with the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel to warn it of impending fiscal crises.
"He told the physicists that if they want to save the S.S.C., they'd better circle their wagons and remember to shoot out, not at each other."
Moreover, the official said, the accelerator physicists should recruit some of the materials scientists who now oppose them. Construction of the proposed Advanced Neutron Source at Oak Ridge, Tenn., would benefit materials scientists but would cost several billion dollars. It could be lumped together by Congress with the supercollider, "and if the S.S.C. goes, the Advanced Neutron Source could go with it," Dr. Park said. "That would be a real blow to materials science in the United States."
Among the physicists specializing in high-energy particle research, some believe that politics has distorted financial priorities.
The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory is building a particle injector for its Tevatron accelerator, the most powerful proton accelerator in the world. The injector, which is expected to cost about $230 million, would pour many more protons and antiprotons into the Tevatron's colliding beams, and this is expected to produce many more discoveries than is possible now. Most high-energy physicists therefore give the Fermilab injector a very high priority.
But the Clinton budget would stretch out construction of the Fermilab injector while appropriating about $200 million for a "B Factory," an accelerator designed to produce large numbers of particles containing the "bottom" quark, a rare form of matter that could shed light on the nature of all matter.
One of the leading "B Factory" proposals would build the new accelerator inside an existing tunnel at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California. Dr. Lederman said that Representative George E. Brown Jr., Democrat of California, is interested in financing the B Factory at the expense of the Tevatron injector less because of scientific merit than because of the supposition that construction of a B Factory would create jobs in California.
Such budget considerations are far from basic research. Dr. Ernest L. Eliel, president of the American Chemical Society and a leading academic scientist, cautioned in a recent essay that serendipity, the accidental discovery of something valuable while searching for something else, is vital to scientific progress.

HEADLINE: An Edgy Los Angeles Awaits a Jury's Verdict

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 10

 BODY:
The City of Los Angeles has a bad case of frayed nerves.
Less than a decade since the city preened as a national exemplar of urban efficiency and racial harmony during the 1984 Olympics, the city must ponder now what has gone wrong -- and whether matters will get even worse when a jury renders a verdict, if it can. 
 In a narrow sense, the jury is deciding the guilt or innocence of four white Los Angeles police officers who beat a black man, Rodney G. King, after stopping him for speeding. But as every Angeleno knows, and many fear, the jurors may also cast the very fate of this city, whose mood now ranges from hysterical to apprehensive.
Around dinner tables, over barber chairs, in offices and movie studios, in Koreatown restaurants, on the streets of the Mexican-American Eastside, the main questions are these: Will a verdict of not guilty bring another wave of racial disorders of the sort that caused nearly $1 billion damage and more than 50 deaths last year? Has anything changed? Has the city learned anything?
 
Where Fear Increases
 The level of fear seems to increase with the distance from the riot's epicenter in South-Central Los Angeles. In distant white enclaves like Bel-Air and Brentwood, many residents are bracing with weapons amid wild, unsubstantiated rumors that gangs are planning forays into those sanctuaries of privilege. But in South-Central, community leaders are generally not anticipating big trouble, though not because of much palpable improvement in social conditions.
"The only people I've seen that's so damned worried about it is Koreans and reporters," said Milton Mallory, an unemployed black construction worker. "Nobody here is so scared. Not much left for me to be scared that I haven't already seen."
The attitudes in the city vary widely, as do those of the following people:
*A prominent local architect and his wife, whites who live in the Wilshire district, a wealthy gated enclave, planned to leave town with their two children to visit relatives in Northern California today. "A lot of people are planning to leave," the woman said. "Our plan is to leave the day the jury goes out for deliberations. I expect everything will be under control, but I'd rather be prepared for the worst, especially with children."
*Outside her home on East 105th Street in South-Central Los Angeles, Michele Galloway foresees calm. "I may be wrong," said Ms. Galloway, who is black and works as a computer analyst. "But I don't think people will express their emotions with violence. The initial shock is all done; the system is not going to change. And the police have sent a message they are prepared -- it's going to dissuade a lot of people." But her neighbor Charles Adams, 25, sees war against the police.
*Inside Luisito's Market, a bright yellow grocery at the corner of Vermont Avenue and 30th Street, Lydia E. Sandoval sits on a milk crate, all eyes and ears. "I think maybe tomorrow, I won't have my business," said Mrs. Sandoval, who spent 14 years working at a hotel to buy this shop seven months ago. "Sometimes I can't sleep, especially this week."
*A couple of miles north, in Koreatown, Mike Kim vows to protect the convenience store he rebuilt after last year's riots, with a new gun. "I don't leave this time," he said, but added he was more confident of police protection now. "I think no more riot. The police, they work good this time, I hope."
So it goes around Los Angeles and its suburbs, land of hope and despair, wealth and poverty. All week the voices of reason and stability have spoken urging calm, Mayor Tom Bradley, Chief Willie L. Williams, Gov. Pete Wilson, the pastors, the teachers, community leaders. Schoolchildren made "peace balloons" and discussed justice and racism in class.
But if soothing words were not enough today, there was also Chief Williams's deployment of 6,500 officers armed with rubber bullets and pepper gas, not to the mention 1,000 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and 800 California Highway Patrol officers, all backed up by National Guard troops waiting in armories.
For now, though, all Rob Markley and his father, Les Markley, are thinking about is how to protect their family business, the Atlas Furniture Company on Santa Monica Boulevard near Western Avenue in Hollywood, for the next week. The store was looted in the rioting last year, and the four stores the Markley's rented to Korean merchants next door were burned down.
 
Security Measures
 The furniture store has been restocked; the windows gated and doors fortified, and a full-time security guard walks amid the merchandise, too.
"I am hoping the city will give us one-day notice before the verdict," said Rob Markley. "We will probably not open that day."
From his listening post behind the counter of the Nate-N-Al Delicatessen in Beverly Hills, Mark Marietta said their patrons were scared of rioters. "They say they're coming to the three B's, "Beverly Hills, Brentwood and Bel-Air," he said, referring to three wealthy areas.
 
TV Generates Fear
 There is no evidence of that, but such fears have been stirred by breathless reporting by local television stations and by all the preparations being made by large organizations. The computer network at the University of Southern California has spread word of how to respond to an emergency. Loyola High School, a Roman Catholic school near downtown, has asked parents to sign waivers relieving it of responsibility for their children after school. The Orange Street Neighborhood Watch Group in the Wilshire district has urged residents to ready the survival gear they keep in case of earthquakes.
A growing chorus complained that news coverage might cause incidents. "Newspeople who do not live in South-Central L.A. have been whipped up into hysteria," John Mack, president of the Urban League chapter, said on Wednesday's edition of "Which Way L.A.?," a radio discussion show on public radio station KCRW that has become the chief broadcast forum for serious issues that television avoids.
On the same show, Chilton Alphonse, director of the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, complained of camera crews asking youths in South-Central Los Angeles with questions like, "If the officers are found not guilty, you're going to riot, aren't you?"
 
Some Trouble Expected
 Cooler heads expect some trouble but nothing like last year's explosion. "The kind of outbreak we had last year requires an enormous amount of energy," Warren Olney, a veteran television reporter and the host of the radio show, said in an interview.
The Rev. Leonard Jackson, associate pastor of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the main black churches, agreed. "I strongly believe that peace will prevail," he said. "It would be suicidal for anyone to go against the odds. Who wants to be a martyr?"
On the streets of the South-Central district, the mood is complex, difficult to fathom. The main streets like Crenshaw Boulevard, Vermont Avenue and Central Avenue still show the rubble and desolation of the disorders, though there has been much rebuilding. As night falls and the gang members emerge, Cleve Freeman drove warily through the streets he has known since youth.
He is a leader of the 75th Street/ Crenshaw Block Club, a group of homeowners who try to protect their neat well-kept houses against the ravages of drug gangs. A supervisor for Southern California Edison, he is a member of a growing black middle class that is as fearful of gangs as whites are, if not more. "Even though I am black and raised in a tough part of this city, there are two different cultures of black people," said Mr. Freeman, 45. "They are operating in a different world. We don't know them."
 
Police Officers a Targets
 Mr. Freeman, a reserve police officer, did not foresee a riot, but something just as ominous -- an assault by young blacks on police officers.
And there were heightened tensions in the area this week after two Los Angeles police officers shot and killed 30-year-old Darrell Harts in the driveway of his home on East 93d Street. The police said he had fired at the officers; some witnesses disputed that.
On Thursday evening, with tensions building over the impending verdict, fraternity brothers and friends of the slain man, a college graduate, held a candlelight vigil under the bright red flowers of a bottle brush tree in front of the Southeast police station on East 108th Street. "I am very concerned about the killing of young African-American men," said one of those who spoke, the Rev. Monroe Woods Jr., who counseled calm. "We just do not need another civil uprising in this city."
But the younger black men in the crowd were filled with anger over Mr. Harts's death and spoke darkly of the weapons they say they have for use against the police.
For their part, the police were wary. "We really have no idea whether something's going to happen or not," said Officer Mario Munoz of the 77th Street Division. "I'm sure we'll have some troublemakers try to start something, but I think the readiness of the department right now is pretty good. Generally, when you have expectations that something is going to happen, nothing happens."

HEADLINE: Satellites Bring Information Revolution to China

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 10

 BODY:
Four years after China's leaders crushed a movement by millions of prodemocracy protesters, they are facing a new challenge -- one that is quieter and less confrontational but eventually perhaps more serious.
The challenge is most visible in the form of hundreds of thousands of satellite dishes that are sprouting, as the Chinese say, like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. 
 Already millions of Chinese can hook in via satellite to the "global village," bypassing the Communist Party commissars and leaving them feuding over how to respond.
 
State Control Is Slipping
 In short, the information revolution is coming to China, and in the long run it threatens to supplant the Communist revolution. For while political power here grows out of the barrel of a gun, as Mao once observed, it is sustained by the Communist Party's monopoly on news and propaganda -- a monopoly that is now crumbling.
"The Government has already lost control over information," a senior Chinese journalist said. "The leaders may not know it yet, but these days they simply can't control what people know."
Most satellite dishes are technically illegal, but hard-liners are finding themselves stymied in their efforts to organize a crackdown. Fundamentally, their frustrations reflect the headaches that the party encounters as it tries to maintain political controls while liberalizing the economy.
The information revolution in China began in the 1980's, with the spread of short-wave radios and the end of the ban on listening to broadcasts by the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corporation. But the pace has picked up enormously in the last couple of years.
 
Direct-Dial to the Outside
 Fax machines are everywhere, even in private homes, and direct-dial international telephones are multiplying much more quickly than the number of State Security employees who bug such calls. The number of long-distance phone calls doubled from 1989 to 1991, when 1.7 billion were recorded.
Computers are spreading as well, so that a growing number of people can communicate via electronic bulletin boards and electronic mail. Young people exchange information with Chinese students studying in the United States, and they can even swap computer viruses -- like the one developed a couple of years ago that appears on a screen to ask whether the computer operator likes Prime Minister Li Peng.
If the person at the keyboard says no, regular work can continue. If the person says he likes the Prime Minister, the virus wipes out all the computer's memory.
In Fujian Province, opposite Taiwan, millions of Chinese aim their antennas eastward and tune in Taiwan television news and other programs. In Guangdong Province in the south, families watch Hong Kong television, sometimes with official cable systems.
 
Voices From Abroad
 Short-wave radios have proliferated and are now an important source of news for dissidents and officials alike. Chinese listen not only to BBC and Voice of America but also to broadcasts from Australia, France and Taiwan.
The next technological wave may belong to satellite dishes, which first appeared in shops about a year ago and now seem to be everywhere. In Beijing alone, dozens of shops sell the dishes, typically about five feet in diameter, for about $500 including the receiver.
"Lots of customers can afford them now, because they're hardly more expensive than a video recorder," said Cao Hongxia, a manager at an electronics shop on the bustling Wangfujing Street. "I get people coming in who want to buy a hundred dishes and then resell them elsewhere."
The hard-liners staked out their position recently in a confidential Communist Party document prepared by the city of Beijing. The paper, one of a series about how to improve social order in Beijing as it applies to be host to the Olympics in the year 2000, uses harsh language to argue that satellite dishes can be used to watch pornography and reactionary programming.
 
Some Welcome the Change
 Another briefing paper, prepared by Shanghai authorities and published in "Internal Reference Selections," a confidential magazine, takes the opposite view. It argues that if China is to modernize its economy, then it must give its people access to instant information and embrace new technologies like satellite television.
"We should have confidence in the viewers," the report declares. "We shouldn't seal the window just because a fly might slip in."
Senior Government leaders recently agreed in principle on a crackdown, and they have held inter-ministry meetings in the last week to decide how to proceed. But the authorities seem deeply constrained because of conflicts of interest within the Government.
The Army General Staff Department and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, for example, both turn a good profit by selling satellite equipment to the public. The Ministry of Electronics operates a factory that says it plans to build 60,000 to 70,000 satellite dishes this year.
It may seem surprising that Government ministries should manufacture and sell products that the same Government bans. But with China's push toward a market economy in recent years, this is not so unusual.
A clinic in southern China run by the family planning commission switched its focus when it discovered it could make more money as a fertility clinic. And a branch of the official Women's Association was caught last year running a prostitution racket.
 
A Shattered Monolith
 As a result, the Government sometimes resembles not so much a Communist monolith as a disorganized conglomerate. The Politburo, acting as a fractious board of directors, often ignores tacit disobedience.
Even if the central Government ordered a major crackdown, it is unclear that it would be enforced outside the capital. Local governments, always lethargic about implementing edicts they dislike, are making money by running cable television systems that depend on satellite television.
"The leaders are trying to ban the dishes," said another Chinese journalist. "But I don't see how they can succeed."
Governments throughout the world are fretting over the same realization: their armies can repel invading troops but are useless against television broadcasts.
 
Banned Images, New Ideas
 In Arab countries, dishes offer viewers a chance to see programs racier than those broadcast by local stations. In Taiwan, people tune in to mainland China television news programs. In India, millions of people are hooking into cable systems connected to satellite dishes, directly encountering foreign ideas and values that never bother to apply for a visa.
No one yet knows what the sociological or political consequences will be.
China passed a law in 1990 banning the use of satellite dishes to receive foreign television signals, except with permission from the police. But the law does not ban the sale of the dishes, nor even their installation, so long as they are used to receive China's own programming.
"When I bought my dish, the salesman told me that if the police ever asked, I should tell them that I use it only to watch China Central Television," said a 28-year-old businessman who bought his dish a few months ago. "The police know that's absurd, but they can't prove it."
The huge white dishes now perch on the roofs of apartment and office buildings in cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, and sometimes even on the roofs of newly built peasant homes.
 
Grass-Roots Sabotage
 The latest trend is for employers and "street committees" to erect one or two huge dishes and then hook up everyone in an apartment building for a fee. The street committees are supposed to be the Communist Party's grass-roots monitoring organizations, but they like to make money too.
"We don't have enough people to implement the law against satellite receivers," said Jin Guojun, an official of the Beijing Radio and Television Bureau, and simultaneously the president of the Beijing Cable TV Network. "And the best approach is not to ban satellite dishes and leave it at that, but rather to give the public an alternative -- like cable TV."
At last count, 1,800 cable television systems were operating in China, with 429 set up in just the first three months of this year.
Some simply show videos, but many show satellite programs, of which by far the most popular are those broadcast by Star Television in Hong Kong. A State Statistical Bureau survey several months ago found that 4.8 million households in China can receive Star Television -- presumably a significant underestimation, since the bureau counted only Government-authorized satellite dishes.
"There's a tremendous amount of potential as the economy of China opens up more and more," said Arnold Tucker, executive vice president of Star Television. "That's as true for satellite TV as for toothpaste or ads or bicycles or anything else."
 
Films, Sports and News
 Star Television, which belongs to the stable of companies controlled by Li Ka-shing, a Hong Kong billionaire, gets its revenue only from commercials. It offers five channels: Chinese-language films and television serials; music television; English-language sports; English-language films and serials; and BBC Television news.
The most politically sensitive by far is BBC. Chinese are beginning to discover that the BBC broadcasts a separate Chinese-language soundtrack, and so they can watch the BBC television news in Chinese.
To be sure, most viewers are more interested in sit-coms or cops-and-robber shows than in news programs.
"What people want is entertainment," said Zhang Zedong, manager of the satellite sales counter at a state-owned shop. "They're not so interested in BBC, but rather in MTV and sports and Chinese-language serials."
Yet even mundane programming like Taiwanese sit-coms seems to have a corrosive effect on the authority of the Communist Party. The sit-coms offer a window into how people overseas live, underscoring the wealth and freedom abroad.
American cops-and-robbers shows sometimes play on Chinese television, and viewers often find the plot twists full of surprises -- like the moments when the bad guys are read their rights and allowed to call a lawyer. To some Chinese, that kind of novelty is more memorable than the plot itself.

HEADLINE: An Environmental Plan Threatens an Old Industry

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WOODLAND TOWNSHIP, N.J., April 9

 BODY:
The water in the Ward Sand and Materials Company dredging pond is as clear as a cloudless sky as the company's little blue dredge steadily vacuums the pond bottom for sand and gravel to feed the region's concrete mixers.
But however clean the water may be or however well the new pine seedlings grow on the mined-over restoration areas, the independent commission that regulates land use in New Jersey's 1.1 million-acre Pinelands National Reserve seems ready to force out most sand mines like this one. 
 A decision to preserve more of the pinelands by curbing one of the oldest industries in the region -- sand mines supplied glassmakers here beginning in the 18th century -- would be the Pinelands Commission's biggest single regulatory step since the national reserve was carved out of southern New Jersey in 1978.
"I can't think of any other proposal that is more far-reaching than this one," said Richard J. Sullivan, chairman of the commission. The proposal appears to have the support of a majority of the panel's members, but no final vote is expected until January.
 
Proposed Changes
 The proposed changes, strongly opposed by industry and some landowners, would reduce the total allowable mining area to 2,800 acres from the current 10,000 acres. Because as about 900 acres have been mined since the pinelands reserve was created, environmentalists favoring the proposed rules argue that the sand operators could have another 30 years of work before being forced to shut down.
Robert Ellis, who has managed the Ward Sand and Materials site since he opened the mining operation in 1972, would be left 99 acres of the 244 acres remaining in his present mining permit, enough for another 10 or 15 years work at the present rate. But Mr. Ellis maintains that private property rights are at stake in the fight, and does not want to be told by preservationists or anyone else that less than half of what he has is enough.
"What do they mean, 'enough'?" he demanded. "I could argue that it would be enough for them to leave me the hell alone."
The anger that the proposed regulations has sparked among the quarry workers comes just as the pinelands management system, in which development is strictly directed away from natural areas into designated growth areas, is being held up as an example for other states.
The system clusters development on the edges of the reserve and allows landowners in restricted areas to sell their development rights to builders operating within development areas.
 
Pattern for New York
 In New York, Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County Executive, has proposed turning the 138,000-acre Long Island Pine Barrens into a similar reserve, borrowing heavily from the pinelands' preservation system. Mr. Gaffney visited the pinelands Wednesday in preparation for a Pine Barrens management conference scheduled for Monday in Melville.
Last Thursday, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed changes in the way the six-million-acre Adirondack State Park, like the pinelands a mix of public and private lands, is managed. The proposal includes elements similar to the pinelands plan.
But the spread of the pinelands idea only enrages many of the "Pineys" who make their living within the borders of the reserve. Phasing out the last big industry in the pinelands, other than cranberry growing and some timber cutting, will increase unemployment, reduce municipal tax receipts and make the South Jersey region less secure, said William J. Cleary, executive director of the New Jersey Concrete and Aggregate Association, which is leading the fight against the new policy on sand mining.
 
44 Companies Operating
 "What disturbs me is that they're going to spread this idea on the basis that the pinelands have been this amazing success, but it's not for the people who live and work here," Mr. Cleary said. "We have taxation problems, unemployment problems, and those are things that are going to come back and haunt places that copy the pinelands in the future."
Some impacts of the proposed changes were supposed to have been spelled out at a special hearing on Thursday. But so many people crowded the Barnegat Township Municipal Building that the meeting was postponed until April 17 so it could be moved to Burlington County College, to make room for what Pinelands Commission members said was the biggest turnout they had seen for a hearing on a proposed rule change.
Digging sand and gravel from the immense, forested sand dune that underlies most of New Jersey's coastal plain is a fairly simple matter for the 44 sand and gravel companies still operating within the reserve. Dredges pump up the material from a maximum allowable depth of 65 feet below the water table and pipe it to machines that separate the sand and gravel by size. The pumped water is passed through special ponds to allow the mud to settle out, and is then returned to the excavation hole, which is filled with water from the underground aquifer.
Once an area is pumped out, the bank of the dredge pond is sloped and new pines are planted on it.
The proposed changes are aimed at phasing out sand dredging in the two most environmentally sensitive areas of the pinelands, the so-called Preservation Area District, covering 365,000 acres, and the Forest Areas, covering 280,000 acres. Two-thirds of the pinelands reserve is privately owned.
 
Worry About Harm
 Since so little else is allowed in these areas, Terrence D. Moore, executive director of the Pinelands Commission said, why should sand mining continue?
"You could go and buy a thousand acres in the Preservation Area for your vacation home or your dream house, and you wouldn't get a permit to build it," Mr. Moore said. "So the interesting question is, if we aren't going to let a person build one house on all that land, should we be allowing an activity that is tearing up hundreds and hundreds of acres?"
The mine operators say that no evidence has surfaced to show that the sand mining is affecting water quality or wildlife outside the mine areas, but Mr. Moore said that the absence of information does not prove that no harm is being done.
"The normal procedure in the pinelands is not to proceed when there is no information available," he said. One possible problem, he said, is that non-native fish might be infiltrating the 65-foot deep dredge ponds, which he said are ecologically different form the shallow ponds that occur naturally in the pinelands.
Mr. Ellis has been fighting the Pinelands Commission since its creation. He believes that changes will eventually impoverish an already heavily regulated region, reduce tax receipts for local townships and ultimately hurt 200,000 pinelands workers who are directly or indirectly dependent on the sand pits.
"And after they take this away," he asked, "what are they going to take away next?"

HEADLINE: Clark Clifford's Judgment

 BODY:
Maneuverings in the courts of New York and Washington have lowered the chances for a satisfying judgment about Clark Clifford, the erstwhile statesman accused of committing fraud for a crooked bank, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Several years after B.C.C.I.'s global financial crimes began to surface, the question persists: Was Mr. Clifford a crook himself -- or a dupe, as he claims?
Mr. Clifford, 86 and recovering from a heart operation, is excused from the trial that has just begun in state court in Manhattan. That leaves his law partner, Robert Altman, to plead that both men were deceived about B.C.C.I.'s illegal foreign control of the American bank they chaired. 
 Meanwhile the Justice Department has dropped similar Federal fraud charges against both men rather than try to meet a June 1 trial deadline in Washington. The Federal dismissal may have less bearing on events than Mr. Clifford's health, since Federal prosecutors have never matched the zeal of Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan's District Attorney, for this case.
Ostensibly a funding resource for third world development, B.C.C.I. bankrolled drug lords, laundered their money and looted depositors on a grand scale. American bank regulators accepted Mr. Clifford's assurances that B.C.C.I. was not in control of First American Bankshares, of which he was chairman and Mr. Altman vice chairman. But the regulators, Congressional investigators and prosecutors say otherwise.
It matters whether Mr. Clifford deliberately or unwittingly fronted for international criminals, delaying for years their detection by bank regulators and drug agents. A trial with Mr. Clifford in the dock might spotlight failures by Federal agencies that allowed the crime to flourish.
Mr. Clifford's character, and his decades of prestigious public service as adviser to Presidents and as Secretary of Defense, are side issues at Mr. Altman's trial. The prosecutor plays up Mr. Clifford's public probity that made his assurances effective; the defense emphasizes his brains, saying he was too smart to risk his reputation on shady deals. But he won't be squarely judged unless later deemed fit to stand trial.
Whatever happens now, one Washington industry has been severely shaken: the special practice of law in the nation's capital. Lawyers there trade heavily on their reputations and claim they deserve social credit for policing their clients. Guilty or innocent, tried or excused, Clark Clifford, a towering figure in that trade, has shattered the image.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
No Success, No Power

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Success feeds power. And President Clinton has little prospect of a power-building success in foreign policy, one that would catapult him to new stature at home and abroad.
From potshots in Iraq to human rights in China, from genocide in Bosnia to trade negotiations with Europe and Japan, from propping up Boris Yeltsin in Russia to cajoling Arabs back to the bargaining table with Israelis, Bill Clinton faces mostly quicksand and mudholes. His best bet for a quick diplomatic score might be in Haiti, but even there peace talks remain wobbly. 
 For 50 years, Presidents have defined themselves decisively and dramatically by their actions on the world stage. John F. Kennedy flew to the Berlin Wall to proclaim his solidarity with besieged Berliners. Ronald Reagan's popularity soared after he "conquered" Grenada. George Bush led a world crusade against Saddam Hussein and instantly transformed himself into a world leader.
Mr. Clinton is not likely to have such opportunities, and his foreign policy successes are likely to be much more modest. In his search for post-cold-war glory, he may well have to focus less on traditional security concerns and more on international economics. Money lacks the sex appeal of a tidy, victorious war, but has its political attractions in times of economic distress.
Americans would not applaud Mr. Clinton's dragging them into military conflicts. They might even be quietly grateful to him for making questionable excuses to avoid intervention. But they will not show their gratitude by lifting him onto their shoulders as a non-conquering hero.
The new President's choices in Bosnia and Iraq are like President Lyndon Johnson's dilemma in Vietnam: damned if he got into an Asian land war, damned if he gave the Vietnamese Communists a victory at the negotiating table.
No nation now has the stomach for another fight against Saddam Hussein or a new war against the Serbs. At the same time, none is openly willing to accept Saddam's staying in power. Nor are American and European leaders prepared for what has become the only realistic way to stop the slaughter of Bosnians -- trisecting Bosnia among the warring factions and thereby legitimizing Serb aggression and genocide. Dreading both war and peace, Mr. Clinton and the others prefer the classic approach: stall and pray for a miracle.
No miracles are needed on China policy. Mr. Clinton simply has to walk the high wire between standing up for human rights and getting along with this growing power on the Asian block. Best for him to explain this difficult stunt forthrightly now before people start accusing him of playing games.
Conversely, a little diplomatic sleight of hand will help Mr. Clinton promote a Syrian-Israeli deal. First the two sides must position themselves for agreement. When the time is ripe, he has to jump in personally and powerfully.
Mr. Clinton handled the Vancouver love feast with Mr. Yeltsin well, yet the Russian leader still could lose his referendum later this month. A Yeltsin defeat won't destroy Mr. Clinton, because he's worked so hard for more aid to Russia. But avoiding political blame for "losing Russia" does not constitute a diplomatic triumph.
The U.S. President needs to demonstrate that he knows how to orchestrate a triumph and close a tough diplomatic deal. He could help reinstate democracy in Haiti if he involved himself directly.
The man from Arkansas has to keep his eye on all these political and military flash points. But the real payoff for him is bound to be in the international economic arena. At home and abroad, everyone wants growth and jobs, which means promoting freer trade.
Mr. Clinton's first test will come on April 16 when he meets with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan. Japanese-American trade has gotten tense and messy. The two industrial giants could slip into mini-trade wars unless the two leaders signal a commitment to compromise. That will require both to show some political guts.
It's going to be harder for Bill Clinton to make his mark in the world arena than it was for his predecessors. But he needs to start somewhere. He has to begin lining up diplomatic triumphs to prove his mettle and skill. For without successes, he will lack the power to lead an unruly world.

HEADLINE: A Clinton Report Card, So Far

BYLINE: By Arthur Schlesinger Jr.; Arthur Schlesinger Jr. is professor in the humanities at the City University of New York.

 BODY:
Before long, the 100 days will be upon us, and we can expect a rush to judgment on the Clinton Presidency. Of course the 100 days test is silly. Franklin Roosevelt gave the 100 days mythic status, but he had a national crisis so urgent and indisputable that the country pleaded for action and Congress dared not say him nay. Except for F.D.R., no President has ever accomplished much legislatively in his first 100 days. Still, the 100 days represent a shakedown cruise that tells the people a good deal about a new President -- and tells him a good deal about the people.
For a man who a short year ago was an unknown quantity to most Americans, and a very dubious figure to some of them, Mr. Clinton has quickly established himself as an articulate, ebullient, untiring and, thus far, rather endearing occupant of the White House. 
 He is plainly a man of marked intellectual force and lively intellectual curiosity, a good listener and a good talker, generally cheerful though given to flashes of bad temper. He is at home with ideas, enjoys politics, understands that successful government requires persuasion and consent and appears to have a guileless faith in the latent idealism and decency of the American people. And in Albert Gore Jr. the nation has (for a change) a serious and thoughtful Vice President.
In a way, Mr. Clinton is a merger of two Democratic leaders of the previous generation who also combined professionalism in politics with idealism in policy -- John Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. Mr. Clinton has J.F.K.'s analytical bent, his detachment and his mastery of detail, and he has Humphrey's exuberance, his gregariousness and his inability to say anything briefly.
Like Kennedy and Humphrey and Lyndon Johnson and like F.D.R. and Harry Truman before them, Mr. Clinton believes in government as an instrument of reform. Like J.F.K. 30 years ago and F.D.R. 30 years before that, he takes over from Presidents who had no use for government at all.
When Ronald Reagan became President, he signaled the change in national direction by proclaiming in his first inaugural: "Government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem." Get government off our backs, the Reaganites declared, and our problems will solve themselves, or rather the free market will solve them.
President Clinton took care to respond in his address to Congress, "I want to talk with you about what the Government can do, because I believe government must do more." He evidently sees himself in the apostolic tradition. One of his early acts was to make a pilgrimage, in the company of F.D.R.'s grandson and Robert Kennedy's son, to the Roosevelt house in Hyde Park. And one of his favorite quotations, used often in the campaign and since, is F.D.R.'s call for "bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something." Except for the part about admitting failure frankly, that was the story of Roosevelt's New Deal.
In embracing the Roosevelt-Truman-Kennedy-Johnson inheritance, President Clinton departs from neo-conservative Democrats who backed his candidacy and now feel aggrieved by lack of subsequent recognition. He differs too from Jimmy Carter, who disbelieved in government, disliked the Kennedys and refused as President even to send a greeting to a reunion of New Dealers celebrating the anniversary of F.D.R.'s first inauguration.
Oddly enough for a believer in government, Mr. Clinton has been dilatory in forming one. I cannot recall a time when a new Administration taking over the White House from the other party has taken so long in making key appointments.
The Department of Defense, for example, still lacks most of its top officials. No doubt filling out financial forms, F.B.I. investigations, etc., account for some of the delay. But the Administration's "diversity" requirement -- "looking like America" -- compounds the problem. The determination to bring in more women and minorities is praiseworthy. But the mechanical application of a diversity standard may at times sacrifice substantive competence to what John Kennedy used to call "visual reassurance."
When Mr. Clinton says he believes government must do more, he does not mean government should do everything. He has no doubt that the free market is the great engine of production, distribution and growth. But he is not under the illusion that the market by itself can cure a lot of the troubles that assail the Republic. The market by itself will not repair America's crumbling infrastructure, or produce universal health care, or protect the environment, or promote racial justice, or save the public schools, or rehabilitate the cities, or salvage the homeless. The market cannot even provide jobs for all Americans ready and willing to work. He sees no alternative to a measure of affirmative government.
Like Roosevelt in 1933 and Kennedy in 1961, Mr. Clinton has the benefit of the pent-up flood of ideas germinating in universities and think-tanks during the conservative phase of the political cycle.
His reform agenda casts an astonishingly wide net: from health insurance and national service through election finance and abortion for poor women to support for high technology and higher fees for logging, grazing and mining on the public lands. Perhaps most important of all, a grand opportunity awaits him to reconstruct the Supreme Court.
But the centerpiece of his agenda, on the success of which much else depends, is his economic plan. In the wine-and-roses days of Kennedy and Johnson, Federal funds were relatively available for social programs. This is no longer the case. Every Republican President since the New Deal has hoped to stop the advance of the welfare state. But Ronald Reagan was the first to figure out how to do it. By cutting taxes, he contrived deficits so large as to discourage further social spending. Then, by persuading voters of the innate depravity of tax increases and by persuading politicians that raising taxes was political suicide, he made it hard to reduce deficits except by social retrenchment.
In February, Mr. Clinton proposed a comprehensive plan designed to deal all at once with the needs for deficit reduction, fiscal stimulus, infrastructure modernization and increased taxes. The plan is based on the premise that long-term growth is the only reliable means of bringing deficits down. It aims to promote such growth not only by short-run stimulus but also by strengthening the foundations for enduring growth -- that is, by rehabilitating infrastructure, retraining workers, improving education, reinforcing research and development.
Herbert Stein, Richard Nixon's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, described it as "probably the most far-reaching effort ever made by a President to control the budget deficit." Most of the plan has moved ahead with minor adjustments, but the $16.3 billion fiscal-stimulus package has provoked a Republican filibuster in the Senate, and action has been postponed until after the Easter recess. The Republican argument is that Mr. Clinton's is a pork-barrel program and that it is not even necessary because recovery is just around the corner.
In fact, the so-called recovery is feeble. It has not been accompanied by corresponding re-employment; indeed, the economy actually lost 22,000 jobs in March. A higher percentage of Americans -- more than one out of 10 -- now resorts to food stamps than at any time since the modern food-stamp program started in 1964. Opponents of stimulus forget that a market economy is quite capable of reaching equilibrium at a low as at a high level of employment. The stronger argument against the package is that it is too small, not too large. Japan, also faced with stagnation, is contemplating a $100 billion package.
Stimulus would seem a good idea. But no one really knows what is likely to work. Anyone under the impression that economics is an exact science should examine the recent Wall Street Journal in which 10 American winners of the Nobel Prize in economics assessed the Clinton plan. The result was cacophony. Economists are about as useful as astrologers in predicting the future (and, like astrologers, they never let failure on one occasion diminish certitude on the next).
There is even dispute as to how tragically we must take budget deficits. Conservative supply-siders like Jude Wanniski and liberal Keynesians like Robert Eisner join in regarding deficit reduction as an overrated issue. For all a mere historian knows, they may be right. In view of the discord within the guild, Mr. Clinton has a point in pinning his flag on F.D.R.'s theory of experimentation.
The Republican filibuster against the fiscal stimulus package is an important if unappreciated step in the education of a President. Obstructionist tactics may identify the Republicans as the party of unemployment and gridlock. Still, they are only doing what an opposition party is supposed to do: opposing. And they are thereby reminding the new President of a difficulty he will face again and again: the difficulty created by the constitutional separation of powers.
Theodore Roosevelt once clenched his fist and said to his young kinsman Franklin Roosevelt, "Sometimes I wish I could be President and Congress too." F.D.R., telling the story 30 years later, added, "I suppose if the truth were told, he is not the only President that has had that idea." The thought may well be passing through President Clinton's mind.
He is already starting to do what the Roosevelts did so well: carrying his program to the country. A lot of nonsense has been written about the iniquity of Mr. Clinton's "permanent campaign." What higher obligation does a President have than to explain his intentions to the people and persuade them that the direction he wishes to go is right? Politics in a democracy is, at the end, an educational process.
Mr. Clinton is also dealing with opposition in another traditional way: by concessions. This is trickier terrain. When a concession policy goes too far, Presidents can concede away the heart of their proposals. Mr. Clinton is already in some trouble for the abandonment of campaign promises, and he will be in far more serious trouble if he starts abandoning Presidential promises.
His quick retreat on grazing, mining and logging fees and certain farm subsidies and his acceptance of exemptions from the energy tax may well persuade Congress that he is an easy fellow to push around -- unless, of course, concessions on minor points assure victory on major ones. Capitulation to the Republican demand that he cut the stimulus program might send a disastrous message to the Hill and the nation.
In due course, Mr. Clinton will learn, as all Presidents learn, that if his hope is to redefine the Republic, he can't please all the people all the time. Some of the most "divisive" Presidents -- Jackson, Lincoln, the Roosevelts -- are accounted among the greatest.
The ability of foreign policy to upset desired priorities is another step in the President's education. Mr. Clinton is no isolationist and regards the revitalization of America as necessary not only for its own sake but for sake of giving foreign policy a solid domestic base. Yet he could hardly have expected the barrage of foreign crises -- Yeltsin, Bosnia, Somalia, Saddam Hussein, GATT, North American Free Trade Agreement, Israeli-Palestine peace talks, North Korean nuclear weapons -- clamoring for instant attention. Still, he has passed his first summit test with distinction, and in his well-reasoned argument for aid to Russia he can count on a degree of bipartisan support.
The political tide is still turning. Kennedy came to the White House in a similar mixed-up time of transition from one phase of the cycle to the next; and, like Kennedy in 1961, President Clinton has narrow Congressional margins in the face of contradictory pressures, some urging him forward to activism, some pulling him back toward conservatism.
But if the past is any precedent, the tide will soon be running fast in the activist direction. If the cyclical rhythm holds, the 1996 election should do for Mr. Clinton what the 1936 election did for Roosevelt and the 1964 election did for Johnson (and would have done for Kennedy): confirm the course and give a reform program the unmistakable stamp of popular approval.
Political leadership appears in collapse around the planet. In Russia, Boris Yeltsin is fighting for his life. China is run by octogenarians. In France, Francois Mitterrand has gone down to humiliating defeat. In Japan and Italy, the political system is unraveling. In Canada, the Prime Minister has announced his resignation. In Britain, Germany, Spain, India, South Africa and elsewhere, governments are in deep trouble.
Only in the U.S. does there seem a surge of confidence and hope. If the young President can rise to the occasion -- and he seems to be doing his damnedest -- he can make quite a difference to the world.

HEADLINE: Filling 'Papa's' Radical Shoes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As another child of a radical 60's visionary, I offer my opinions to provide further evidence that we won't go away. 
 My name is Andrew Hoffman. I'm the son of the late Abbie Hoffman: 60's radical, 70's fugitive and 80's environmental crusader. I am 32 and an artist. My half-brother, America Hoffman, 22, is an electronics expert in San Francisco. My sister, Ilya Hoffman, 30, is graduating from Western New England Law School and plans to work as a criminal lawyer. My sister and I grew up in Cambridge, Mass., where we sat in on Harvard University courses, and with our mother, Sheila, attended lectures by Herbert Marcuse. Dick Gregory's "No More Lies" is one of the first books I read.
We accompanied Papa to many rallies and witnessed a few days of the Chicago Eight trial. We visited him on an island in the St. Lawrence River, where, using the name Barry Freed, he and Johanna Lawrenson helped to save the river.
Ever since he left me a legacy instead of an estate, I have been more active. Like him, I am involved with politics in a theatrical, radical way.
In 1989 in Boston, I held a memorial benefit for my father called Organizers International, to draw bickering left-wing groups together for a night of community fund-raising, music and coalition. There was a feeling of unity sadly lacking in liberal politics today.
Last summer, I was arrested in Chicago because of my work in a needle-exchange program to prevent the spread of AIDS.
I am setting up America's Soup Kitchen on Wheels (Askow), a nonprofit corporation in Boston, to feed, clothe and befriend homeless people. We are involved with street theater on college campuses to feed people's minds as well as their bellies. I plan to write "Son of 'Steal This Book.' "
I am part of the train of enthusiasts working for peaceful revolution, like David Dellinger ("From Yale to Jail"). Being a revolutionary is as simple as making whatever efforts one can to arrest the ongoing slide toward an environmentally polluted and socially toxic society. We have to fight corporate insensitivity and the power and greed it breeds. We must move toward economic and racial justice if we are to have a true democracy and avoid violent rebellion, like the Los Angeles riots. Everyone can make a difference; all they have to do is get involved.

HEADLINE: How to Help Russia And Create U.S. Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Military Cuts: A Millstone for Ex-Workers" (front page, April 5) describes the difficult plight of workers laid off because of cuts in military spending. "President Urges America to Back Help for Moscow" (front page, April 2) reports that only 41 percent of American adults favor giving economic aid to help reform Russia's economy. Many people oppose helping Russia as long as so many Americans are out of work. 
 Why not solve both of those problems in one stroke? Building modern oil-drilling equipment, fiber-optics telephone networks, computers, food-processing equipment and technology to clean up the environment, which Russia needs desperately, could create jobs for many unemployed defense workers.
Helping Russia and the other former Soviet republics become free and prosperous countries can employ even more Americans than building bombs and missiles to destroy them, and serves our own security better in the long run.

HEADLINE: Plight of Architects Who Are Women

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
IF you are an architect, particularly an architect who is a woman, the maxim "Stay alive until '95" is wearing thin.
"By '95, the building industry is supposed to have rebounded, but those of us affiliated with construction are skeptical," said Erika Krieger, an architect and now Mount Vernon's Building Commissioner. "We sense the downturn that started long before the administration had recognized it formally because when it comes to women architects, it's the old story of last hired, first fired, and when the recession hits, among the first to be let go by the larger architectural firms were women architects. There had never been a lot of us in the profession until recently." 
 Ms. Krieger, a registered architect who previously ran her own architectural business in Dobbs Ferry, has been working in her city post for a little more than a year.
 
A Demanding Position
 "As the recession began to worsen, those of us in practice as one-person firms began to quickly see the handwriting on the wall," Ms. Krieger said. "The larger firms were willing to take on smaller projects, leaving the rest of us competing for fewer jobs.
"When I heard of the building commissioner's position opening up, I applied for it immediately. I'm a native of Mount Vernon, and I know the city well. I still have a practice, but it is limited to a few clients for whom I do residential work and a couple of small offices."
As Building Commissioner, Ms. Krieger has a staff of 16 to deal with literally "everything to do with building -- from reviewing housing plans and heat complaints to demolition," she said. "It's a demanding position, and being an architect is helpful."
 
'Architecture Is Underpaid
 Ms. Krieger, 36, is licensed in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. She said that when she graduated from McGill University in Montreal, 20 percent of the class was women. "Now women make up 50 percent of newly graduated architects, and that's good," she said. "What is bad is that most of them can't find jobs today after going through tough and demanding courses. As professions go, architecture is underpaid. Those of us in it really love it."
Noel R. F. Shaw Jr., president of the Westchester/Mid-Hudson chapter of the American Institute of Architects, said that all architects are having trouble finding jobs in Westchester.
"It's probably the worst time in a decade for architects in the area," Mr. Shaw said. "Our association membership has decreased by about 20 percent this year. I think architects have either left the profession or else they are out of work and can't pay their dues."
New residential construction is almost nonexistent, Mr. Shaw said, adding that the one bright spot is renovation. "Residential and commercial renovations have picked up, and we hope that is a sign that this year is going to be better."
 
Renovation Filling the Gap
 Renovation jobs are keeping architects alive, said Suellen DeFrancis, head of her own architectural and interior-design firm in Scarsdale.
"Having a dual profession, wearing two hats, as an architect and an interior designer, has been a strong selling point for me," Ms. DeFrancis said. "During the recession it is an advantage to be able to tell clients that you can take on the whole job, from drafting plans for a new roof down to installing the carpet, and bring it in more economically than two different professionals would be able to do."
 
Handmade Tiles
 Ms. DeFrancis added: "I find that in the recession there is some good, because you get top value for renovation and restoration work. The contractors who have survived are willing to do smaller jobs. Good workers are plentiful, and many excellent craftsmen are available. People are staying put, and many have refinanced their houses favorably, which has freed up money for renovation."
Ms. DeFrancis is now renovating a three-story 1908 American Craftsman house in Bronxville for Eloise Morgan, her client. "The house, which appeared in the November 1912 edition of House and Garden magazine as a good example of the Arts and Crafts movement, is being restored as much as possible," Ms. DeFrancis said.
"We're working from old photographs and, for example, in the lodge room, which was originally an informal billiards and game room, the sliding doors installed by previous owners have been removed and stone work is being done on the fireplace. And the dropped ceiling, also put in by a former owner, has been taken out," Ms. DeFrancis added.
In the living room, she said, tiles are being handmade to match the old tiles by the same company that did the original work.
"The fake molding and the bookcases, which were also added by other owners, are being replaced," she said. "The work is fascinating. We started about three years ago, and when we are finished all 12 rooms will have been restored."
 
'I Feel I Am Very Lucky'
 Ms. DeFrancis's assistant, Theresa Beyer, a registered architect, takes her 7-month-old infant to the office. "Few offices are so flexible, and there are few jobs around, so I feel I am very lucky," Ms. Beyer said. "In this profession it's very important to keep a finger on the pulse. When you are away too long, you lose contacts, and when you're ready to go back, it becomes harder to convince clients to hire you."
Barbara Rogge Maloy, who was an art major in college, said she always wanted to be an architect but waited until her children were grown to go to architectural school. "I commuted to the New York Institute of Technology from Katonah for three years," Ms. Maloy said. "And then when I passed my exam to become registered in 1990, it was probably the worst of times for new architects. There was a trickle-down effect going on. Medium-size firms with high overhead were hit the hardest so they began competing with smaller firms who were becoming even smaller still."
Yet Ms. Maloy, now a member of the board of the Westchester chapter of the American Institute of Architects, said she was surprised that she was offered a job in an architect's office in Greenwich. "I know my art background helped," she said. "It gave me an edge as an architect."
Six months ago she started her own practice in Katonah.
"What happened was that several people approached me and queried me about residential renovations and additions, and so I took the plunge," she said. "I've done a few jobs, and currently I'm working on a very interesting project: a generation-span house, which means carving out a wing with a separate entrance but connected to the house -- for my client's elderly mother. I think the demand for that type of flexible three-generation housing is certainly growing. And I enjoy this kind of assignment."
 
Working for Herself
 Susan R. Bresler, a graduate of Cornell University's School of Architecture and Harvard University's School of Business, is also licensed as a contractor in Florida, but Ms. Bresler said she is waiting for the upturn in the economy before she starts her own business.
"In the interim, I am working for myself," Ms. Bresler, who lives in Mamaroneck, said. "I'm designing a house for my own family, which includes my husband and three young sons. I'm going to do my own contracting and hope to start building by summer."
Ms. Bresler, who intends to specialize in residential design, said that although she believes that men and women have the same architectural capabilities, when it comes to residential design, women may have an edge.
"It's not a sexist thing but a practical observation I've made," she said. "Women still do most of the work in the home, and a woman architect understands her client's needs firsthand. I look at home design as a jigsaw puzzle. It's a matter of best fitting the site, the house and the family together to make a coherent whole."

Developers Turning to Farms and Forests

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
HOME builders are turning to virgin forests and farmland far from this city's job markets because closer sites are locked up in land-use disputes.
Longtime developers like William Conner are rethinking strategies and focusing on rural towns because, they say, the state's 1989 Growth Management Act requires cities to designate certain areas as rural, closing thousands of acres to development. 
 The act was a response to the alarm of residents who saw a 1980's-type housing boom, spurred by a job spurt at Boeing, creating urban sprawl, chaotic traffic and soaring home prices in the suburbs.
Seattle sprawls for about 20 miles along Puget Sound and for two decades developers have followed the Interstate 5 corridor to the north toward Everett and south to Kent and Tacoma, turning the area into a congested, 100-mile-long megacity. Since the early 80's the Kent Valley's lush farmlands have given way to homes, strip malls and warehouses.
With Interstate 90, on which work began in the early 80's, nearing completion, Mr. Conner and other builders now are looking 30 miles east of Seattle in towns like North Bend, Snoqualmie and Carnation. I-90 stretches eastward through the Snoqualmie Valley into the rugged Cascade Mountains.
"We shouldn't be in these towns," said Mr. Conner. "They're a long way out." He said that he would rather be on I-90 some 15 miles closer to Seattle on the Sammamish Plateau, but that zoning there prevented development.
Some Seattle workers also don't want to be in these towns or on the east side of Lake Washington because they must cross it on one of the two bridges, where rush hour traffic often is snarled. One bridge section, damaged in a 1990 storm, is still being replaced.
Snoqualmie Valley towns also can be snowy, making commuting difficult. Farther east, at Snoqualmie Pass, winter avalanches often close I-90 for hours or days and big-rig trucks line up for miles waiting for roads to reopen.
Mr. Conner has watched the growth patterns change since he formed Conner Development in 1957. He will build about 140 homes this year, the same as in 1992, compared to 180 homes a year when the market was strong.
Near North Bend, he sold 50 speculative homes in his Riverpoint project in 1992 at prices of $224,000 to $285,000. The appeal there is one-acre lots with stunning views of the Cascades. To lure buyers a year ago, Mr. Conner urged each visitor to cut a Christmas tree on the forested lots that had to be cleared.
This winter, because of the poor economy, he didn't have a bite on the last seven Riverpoint homes until mid-February, when he sold three in one week. An offer on a fourth was canceled because the hopeful buyer's company lost an important contract when Boeing pared production.
Uncertainties at Boeing contributed to sluggish home sales in the last half of 1992 and the market has not yet snapped back. The aerospace company has been cutting jobs for more than a year and announced in February it would give pink slips to 15,000 more Seattle-area workers this year and 4,000 next year. Builders are concerned over how this will affect future sales but say a bright spot is that companies such as Microsoft are healthy.
MOST of the Riverpoint buyers were from Seattle or its suburbs and are professionals working for Boeing or Microsoft, both of which are based in Redmond, an east-side suburb.
The North Bend City Council has been besieged with development proposals and annexation requests. In Washington, a large land owner or group of owners in an unincorporated area outside a city's limits can ask the city for annexation. Some developers have sought this because North Bend allows a 15,000-square-foot minimum lot size compared to mostly five-acre lots in King County.
The influx of "outsiders" angers many residents who are fighting development. At council hearings, they have protested development, angry that soaring home prices are causing property taxes to double, and concerned that runoff from mountain ridges cleared for houses will flood their homes. They say their children will not be able to afford homes there and they fear gridlock in towns like North Bend, which now only has one stoplight, or in Snoqualmie, which has none. Opposition initially halted one of Mr. Conner's projects, Tannerwood, near North Bend. Last fall, King County denied his application to build 109 homes, saying it would threaten the rural character of the area. He won an appeal taken to the King County Zoning and Subdivision Office and expects to get his approvals within several weeks.
"IN our eyes, Tannerwood is one of the last pieces of land left for development near Interstate 90," Mr. Conner said. "Most of the area has been downzoned to 5-acre lots."
His land costs, he said, have soared by $7,000 an acre since he first optioned the property in 1992 and record high lumber prices will add $5,000 to the price of a home.
"I've got $12,000 per lot I've got to get rid of to appeal to the same market segment," he said. "I will have to trim about 200 square feet from the size of the house."
To test market strength and preference, he will at first build a half dozen speculative houses of 2,400 to 2,600 square feet using several designs.
Gordon and Karen Byrd, who sold their home in Chicago eight months ago and left the advertising field, would like to buy in Tannerwood. "You can get more for your money," Mr. Byrd said. "Friends say their kids thrive in the school system here. And there is no busing, the reason we won't buy in Seattle."
Banks, including Seafirst, Mr. Conner's banker of 30 years, have stiffened rules on lending and require him to invest 10 to 40 percent of his costs up front before they will provide loans. Until about 1991 banks lent 100 percent, with few questions asked -- a major factor in the savings-and-loan debacle.
Nearly five years ago Mr. Conner and a fellow Bellevue builder, Fred Burnstead, spent $1 million, or $20,000 an acre, for 50 acres in Snoqualmie. The property is next to the site of Snoqualmie Ridge, a 2,000-home, billion-dollar residential development proposed in 1989 by the Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company. It has been held up by financing problems and a long approval process. Nothing has been built yet. And last fall the Snoqualmie Indian tribe opposed access road plans, saying Wyerhaeuser had not adequately considered the tribe's culture and heritage.
The two partners cannot get their project under way until Weyerhaeuser builds roads and utilities. When Weyerhaeuser does move forward, Mr. Conner and Mr. Burnstead could be among those building the Snoqualmie Ridge homes.
Paul Wozniak, manager of the real estate and land department of John L. Scott's, a large Seattle broker, said he believed that by 1995 land for new housing would reach "a critically low level." He just made a study that indicates the shortage will most greatly affect affordable housing in the Puget Sound area. Causing the shortage are increasingly complex development regulations on several government levels, unwillingness by banks to lend money to developers and rising mitigation fees for roads and schools.
MR. WOZNIAK said that in Redmond, two developers with adjacent land, Quadrant and Blackhawk Port Blakely Communities, had spent $10 million on development fees since 1990 but recently refused to invest more until major hurdles were cleared.
Seattle, which supplies water to most of King County, is embroiled in regional water issues and says it will no longer commit to providing water. The state also has yet to build access to Route 18, which links up to I-90, from the Snoqualmie Ridge project.
Mr. Conner started building homes along I-90 in 1985 at a development called Klahanie, in Issaquah, 15 miles from Seattle. When he began there, he said, even Issaquah "seemed like it was too far out," but "now I consider it close in."
Mr. Conner paid $19,000 for 50- by 100-foot lots for $85,000 Klahanie homes. The homes have sold well because they were marketed as affordable in an attractive foothills setting with good freeway access.
In recent months, as the last few land parcels available there rose in price to $65,000 a lot, Mr. Conner decided against even bidding because the homes would sell for $200,000. Now he wishes he had bid because of the scarcity of available land.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
Seattle Builders Turn to Farms and Forests

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
Home builders are turning to virgin forests and farmland far from this city's job markets because closer sites are locked up in land-use disputes.
Longtime developers like William Conner are rethinking strategies and focusing on rural towns because, they say, the state's 1989 Growth Management Act requires cities to designate certain areas as rural, closing thousands of acres to development. 
 The act was a response to the alarm of residents who saw a 1980's-type housing boom, spurred by a job spurt at Boeing, creating urban sprawl, chaotic traffic and soaring home prices in the suburbs.
Seattle sprawls for about 20 miles along Puget Sound and for two decades developers have followed the Interstate 5 corridor to the north toward Everett and south to Kent and Tacoma, turning the area into a congested, 100-mile-long megacity. Since the early 80's the Kent Valley's lush farmlands have given way to homes, strip malls and warehouses.
With Interstate 90, on which work began in the early 80's, nearing completion, Mr. Conner and other builders now are looking 30 miles east of Seattle in towns like North Bend, Snoqualmie and Carnation. I-90 stretches eastward through the Snoqualmie Valley into the rugged Cascade Mountains.
"We shouldn't be in these towns," said Mr. Conner. "They're a long way out." He said that he would rather be on I-90 some 15 miles closer to Seattle on the Sammamish Plateau, but that zoning there prevented development.
Some Seattle workers also don't want to be in these towns or on the east side of Lake Washington because they must cross it on one of the two bridges, where rush hour traffic often is snarled. One bridge section, damaged in a 1990 storm, is still being replaced.
Snoqualmie Valley towns also can be snowy, making commuting difficult. Farther east, at Snoqualmie Pass, winter avalanches often close I-90 for hours or days and big-rig trucks line up for miles waiting for roads to reopen.
Mr. Conner has watched the growth patterns change since he formed Conner Development in 1957. He will build about 140 homes this year, the same as in 1992, compared to 180 homes a year when the market was strong.
Near North Bend, he sold 50 speculative homes in his Riverpoint project in 1992 at prices of $224,000 to $285,000. The appeal there is one-acre lots with stunning views of the Cascades. To lure buyers a year ago, Mr. Conner urged each visitor to cut a Christmas tree on the forested lots that had to be cleared.
This winter, because of the poor economy, he didn't have a bite on the last seven Riverpoint homes until mid-February, when he sold three in one week. An offer on a fourth was canceled because the hopeful buyer's company lost an important contract when Boeing pared production.
Uncertainties at Boeing contributed to sluggish home sales in the last half of 1992 and the market has not yet snapped back. The aerospace company has been cutting jobs for more than a year and announced in February it would give pink slips to 15,000 more Seattle-area workers this year and 4,000 next year. Builders are concerned over how this will affect future sales but say a bright spot is that companies such as Microsoft are healthy.
Most of the Riverpoint buyers were from Seattle or its suburbs and are professionals working for Boeing or Microsoft, both of which are based in Redmond, an east-side suburb.
The North Bend City Council has been besieged with development proposals and annexation requests. In Washington, a large land owner or group of owners in an unincorporated area outside a city's limits can ask the city for annexation. Some developers have sought this because North Bend allows a 15,000-square-foot minimum lot size compared to mostly five-acre lots in King County.
The influx of "outsiders" angers many residents who are fighting development. At council hearings, they have protested development, angry that soaring home prices are causing property taxes to double, and concerned that runoff from mountain ridges cleared for houses will flood their homes. They say their children will not be able to afford homes there and they fear gridlock in towns like North Bend, which now only has one stoplight, or in Snoqualmie, which has none.
Opposition initially halted one of Mr. Conner's projects, Tannerwood, near North Bend. Last fall, King County denied his application to build 109 homes, saying it would threaten the rural character of the area. He won an appeal taken to the King County Zoning and Subdivision Office and expects to get his approvals within several weeks.
"In our eyes, Tannerwood is one of the last pieces of land left for development near Interstate 90," Mr. Conner said. "Most of the area has been downzoned to 5-acre lots."
His land costs, he said, have soared by $7,000 an acre since he first optioned the property in 1992 and record high lumber prices will add $5,000 to the price of a home.
"I've got $12,000 per lot I've got to get rid of to appeal to the same market segment," he said. "I will have to trim about 200 square feet from the size of the house."
To test market strength and preference, he will at first build a half dozen speculative houses of 2,400 to 2,600 square feet using several designs.
Gordon and Karen Byrd, who sold their home in Chicago eight months ago and left the advertising field, would like to buy in Tannerwood. "You can get more for your money," Mr. Byrd said. "Friends say their kids thrive in the school system here. And there is no busing, the reason we won't buy in Seattle."
Banks, including Seafirst, Mr. Conner's banker of 30 years, have stiffened rules on lending and require him to invest 10 to 40 percent of his costs up front before they will provide loans. Until about 1991 banks lent 100 percent, with few questions asked -- a major factor in the savings-and-loan debacle.

The World of a Combat Division in Vietnam.
By Eric M. Bergerud.

 HE war in Vietnam corrupted nearly everything American that it touched. Not least, it sorely injured the equalitarian ideal by imposing its burdens of combat, wounds and death with gross disproportion upon the underclasses of American society. Yet this particular toll of the war has not received its due recognition.
Christian G. Appy, in "Working-Class War," reminds us of the disturbing truth that some 80 percent of the 2.5 million enlisted men who served in Vietnam -- out of 27 million men who reached draft age during the war -- came from working-class and impoverished backgrounds. Eric M. Bergerud -- a professor of military and American history at Lincoln University in San Francisco whose first book was "The Dynamics of Defeat: The Vietnam War in Hau Nghia Province" -- now offers a microcosmic view of the fighting that further develops the implications of the working-class character of the United States Army.
Mr. Bergerud's explicit concern in "Red Thunder, Tropic Lightning" is not with such class issues but with a detailed recounting of the experiences of the 25th Infantry Division, the "Tropic Lightning Division," so called because of its historic base in Hawaii and its taro-leaf and lightning-bolt shoulder patch. But his book closely complements Mr. Appy's.
Both, for example, emphasize a tactical difference between the Vietnam War and other American wars that acquires special significance in light of Mr. Appy's theme. Because, lacking a better strategy, the United States made imposing a high body count upon the enemy a central purpose of its Vietnam campaigns, and because the enemy was difficult to find for the purpose of killing him, American infantry habitually acted as human bait to lure the National Liberation Front forces, the Vietcong in general and occasionally the North Vietnamese Army out of hiding, so aircraft and artillery could maul them.
The modern American military has always preferred to substitute firepower for manpower, to accomplish the killing with large and high-technology weapons. In Vietnam, however, the substitution was incomplete. Although infantrymen were not expected to do the main fighting, they had to offer themselves up as sacrifices to precipitate the fighting, or rather the killing by heavy weapons. Because a hostile, or at least distrustful, local population severely limited intelligence of the enemy's whereabouts, the American infantry tended to blunder into ambushes.
But from the perspective of the American high command, the blundering was not altogether unintentional. If an ambush drew out the enemy, then it was worthwhile. Whether this role as sacrificial offering, as bait, would have been permitted had the troops represented a fuller cross section of American society, if the educated middle class had been losing more of its sons in the process, is an especially unpleasant question for the reader of these books to ponder.
Both books also evoke the sense of futility that accompanied the infantry's mission as bait. The soldiers seemed to "hump the boonies" endlessly, prowl through jungles, marshes, savannas and mountains, parched by heat. Often in the drier areas they were so thirsty that when they reached a watercourse they drank mud filled with insects before bothering to pop their disinfectant pills into their canteens. All the while they were fighting off leeches; at best, they were half-sick and dog-tired long before the enemy allowed them to complete their sacrificial role.
The whereabouts of the enemy was almost always mysterious, but the lay of the land was not; not least of the reasons for feeling it was all senseless was the return over the same ground again and again, forever retaking landmarks that had been visited a week or a month before. The men came to know their area of operations all too well, but they never securely "owned" any of it. Again, the question arises: would the United States have supported a war so lacking in evident strategic purpose had its Army comprised different classes of men?
Mr. Appy, who teaches history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, deals especially well with the apparent paradox that the working-class soldiers' families back home mainly opposed the antiwar movement, and for that matter so with few exceptions did the soldiers themselves. Opposing the antiwar movement, however, was not the same as supporting the war. The middle-class and upper-class war protesters at home, particularly the college students, fumbled their chance to forge some sort of unity with the soldiers. They did so by speaking and behaving in ways that emphasized the social and economic divisions between them and the fighting men. Mr. Appy acknowledges that in time the protesters helped reform some of the inequities of the Selective Service System, but he finds that on the whole their attitudes toward the soldiers were arrogant, sanctimonious and insensitive to the moral quandaries of those who had to fight.
All of this retains its pertinence. The present all-volunteer armed forces still suffer from much of the class skewing of the Vietnam-era draft. The consequent difficulties could therefore recur. Nevertheless, the United States Government demonstrated during the Persian Gulf war that it had profited at least in some degree from the experience of Vietnam, that it can conduct a limited war not only more purposefully but also, through mobilizing National Guard and Reserve units, with greater concern for equity. The antiwar movement, in contrast, re-emerged during the gulf war to show that its members still resided mentally in the 1960's and had learned nothing. The nation is not where we might wish it to be either in democratizing the burdens of war or in trying to halt or curtail it. Mr. Appy and Mr. Bergerud provide information and insights that move one to reflect on both issues.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aides in Egypt Said to Have Met With Group Tied to New York Blast

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, April 11

 BODY:
Officials from the United States Embassy have had meetings since 1991 with militant leaders of the Islamic Group, an organization that is being scrutinized in connection with the World Trade Center bombing, said two members of the group who took part in the sessions and Western diplomats who said they were aware of the contacts.
The militants, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the initial meetings had been held at the embassy's request and centered on allegations of human rights abuses committed by the Egyptian Government. 
 They said that sessions had been held in Egypt and elsewhere but that the contacts had been suspended after the bombing of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26. The blast killed 6 people, injured 1,000 others and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
 
Exiled Cleric as Mentor
 Several suspects charged in connection with the bombing attended services at mosques in New Jersey and Brooklyn to hear the preaching of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, an Egyptian cleric regarded as a key spiritual mentor of the Islamic Group. The United States is trying to deport Mr. Abdel Rahman, but has not charged him. He has said he had no connection with the bombing.
Three Islamic Group leaders who took part in the talks, though well known for their ties with the clandestine organization and their friendship with Mr. Abdel Rahman, said they had never officially identified themselves to the Embassy employees as belonging to or speaking for the Islamic Group. Membership in the group is considered a crime in Egypt punishable by death.
They said the last meeting had been held a little more than six weeks ago, shortly before the explosion at the World Trade Center.
"We were never told why the dialogue was broken off," said one Islamic Group leader who met with embassy officials. "As far as we are concerned, the Americans are welcome to see us at any time."
The United States Embassy denied that it had ever formally requested a meeting with representatives of the group, which has called for the violent ouster of the Government of President Hosni Mubarak. But embassy officials did not deny that several meetings involving three staff members and militant leaders had been held in Cairo.
 
Statement From the Embassy
 "There has been no effort to establish contact with members of the Islamic Group and organizations that have claimed responsibility for acts of terrorism," a spokeswoman for the Embassy said.
"The Islamic Group has not contacted the State Department to discuss human rights or any other issue," she said. "The United States strongly opposes the use of terrorist tactics by any organization to achieve its political goals. We have no intention of meeting with these people."
Western diplomats who were aware of the contacts said United States officials were walking a fine line between seeking to understand the goals and nature of the opposition group and refraining from any official relationship with a known terrorist organization.
The Islamic Group has attacked police officers, Coptic Christians, Egyptian Government officials and tourists in its drive to destabilize the state. The attacks, and police raids carried out against Islamic militants, have left at least 120 people dead in the last year.
The militant leaders said the Americans -- three political officers from the Embassy, who often visited separately -- appeared to be interested in documenting reports of human rights abuses, as well as understanding the group's philosophy and aims.
 
Memories of Iran and Sudan
 United States diplomats and intelligence officials stationed in countries with revolutionary movements, like Iran before the overthrow of the Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, were later criticized for failing to grasp the depth of popular discontent or the goals and structure of the revolutionary opposition. Western diplomats were also caught off guard by the rise to power of an Islamic Government in Sudan after a 1989 military coup.
Some analysts have called President Jimmy Carter's decision to stand behind the Shah until his ouster in January 1979 a devastating failure in United States foreign policy.
"The U.S. officials wanted to know of human rights abuses in great detail," said one Egyptian militant who took part in the talks, "but they also wanted to understand our ideology and outlook. The Americans do not want to repeat the mistakes they committed in Iran and the Sudan, when they supported unpopular regimes when everyone else had turned against them."
While few Western diplomats go so far as to suggest that the Egyptian Government is in danger of falling, many now acknowledge that they had seriously underestimated the power and strength of the Islamic Group. Most diplomats expect violence against the Government to intensify, especially if it does not begin to introduce political and economic changes.
 
Party's Grip on Power
 But the governing National Democratic Party, which has dominated the country under various names since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1952, appears to have little inclination to release its grip on power or restructure the economy. Western analysts say that Egypt's state sector is bloated and inefficient and that its bureaucracy is riddled with corruption.
Government officials blame the surge of violence on outside forces. They contend that the Islamic Government in Iran and the infusion into the militant movement here of Egyptians who fought in the Afghan civil war are the root causes behind the new wave of attacks. Mr. Mubarak's Government is counting on a tough new campaign by the country's security forces to break the back of the movement.
"The Mubarak regime is weak," one of the militant leaders asserted, "and it is our impression that the Americans are beginning to realize this."
Yet while the militants said that the embassy officers with whom they had met had a grasp of the popular disenchantment with the Mubarak administration, they also sensed that American officials had a deep distrust of Islamic fundamentalist groups.
"These diplomats understand what is happening on the street," said one member who took part in the meetings, "but they also have an irrational fear of us. We do not have a problem with America. We can have good relations, but they insist on propping up Mubarak."
 
An Important U.S. Ally
 The loss of Egypt as a close ally would be a devastating blow to United States policy in the Middle East. With one-third of the Arab world's population, Egypt is a critical supporter of American interests in the region and is the only Arab state that has made peace with Israel.
Israel and Egypt receive 36 percent of all foreign aid in the United States budget -- $5.1 billion out of a total this year of $13.9 billion. The Embassy in Cairo has the biggest staff of any United States mission in the world. It maintains contact with a spectrum of individuals, groups and organizations, and the fortress-like compound is the headquarters of regional intelligence-gathering offices.

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Critics of Bankruptcy Law See Inefficiency and Waste

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
As the economy has slogged its way through recession and a slow recovery, hundreds of large publicly held corporations -- from Continental Airlines to R. H. Macy -- have sought shelter from their creditors in bankruptcy court.
Now, with many of these cases mired in the courtroom, complaints are rising that a more permissive Federal Bankruptcy Code, adopted in 1978, has become a refuge for incompetent executives and a cornucopia for greedy lawyers. 
 Until 1978, the American bankruptcy process was less forgiving to debtors, turning their operations over to outside trustees. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 gave the benefit of the doubt to managers who wanted to stay in charge, in hopes of conserving jobs and salvaging businesses. It also left few limits on what lawyers and other professionals could be paid in the bankruptcy process.
But critics of the current bankruptcy law contend that policies intended to conserve corporate cash -- by allowing knowledgeable managers to patch up problems instead of selling a company's assets off piecemeal -- are contributing to corporate waste. And as companies have increasingly spent more time operating under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, their protected status has come to affect the economic conditions faced by competing businesses that are not operating under court protection.
 
Attention to Airlines
 Indeed, Chapter 11 and its abuse are Topic A for a new commission charged by Congress with devising a plan by midsummer to put the bloom back in the cheeks of the ailing airlines, an industry severely affected by the changes in bankruptcy law.
While the commission is worried about the health of the airlines, others are concerned with the health of the bankruptcy system. Howell T. Heflin, an Alabama Democrat who is chairman of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on courts and administrative practice, is pressing for legislation that would, among other provisions, put strict limits on how long a corporation could tarry in Chapter 11. He can count on broad support: the Senate passed a similar bill without dissent last year, although it later died in conference committee.
 
Put to New Uses
 The 1978 law made bankruptcy more attractive to troubled companies, as had been expected. But both the public and lawmakers were startled when corporations began to use Chapter 11 for purposes ranging from breaking tough labor contracts to resolving complex liability claims, including damages from asbestos and from birth-control devices.
But the bankruptcy process -- the quintessentially American idea of allowing a new start with a clean slate -- was further tarnished as more traditional cases took ever longer to resolve and fees began to soar.
 
 
Calls for Change Grow
 Bold plans for abolishing Chapter 11 altogether -- or making it unattractive to any but the most desperate petitioners -- are still just gleams in the eyes of academics. But the notion that significant change is needed is gaining converts.
"A year ago I would have said radical reform was impossible," said Michael Rosenzweig, a partner in an Atlanta law firm, Rogers & Hardin. "Not today."
On first glance, the classic rationale for Chapter 11 seems rock solid. An insolvent public corporation may be worth more as a going concern than as a pile of assets to be sold quickly and cheaply to the highest bidders. Because managers generally understand their companies better than anyone else, it behooves creditors and stockholders as a group -- not to mention employees, suppliers and affected communities -- to give the boss time to devise a plan that most claimants would prefer to a fire sale.
Yet economists agree that Chapter 11 invites abuse by managers of large publicly held corporations who want to keep their jobs, and it creates conflicts among creditors that pull bankruptcy judges in a variety of directions.
 
 
Self-Interest Served by Delay
 Once driven to take refuge in Chapter 11, well-paid executives who have little hope of salvaging a business still may have selfish reasons to delay the inevitable. And delay is usually not difficult to arrange.
Under the 1978 law, management has 120 days to come up with a reorganization plan before creditors can petition for liquidation. But because judges often see their own mission as saving failing businesses, managers are usually given extension after extension if they can offer a shred of hope for success.
Worse, perhaps, managers have incentives to take chances with the creditors' money in the interim. If they strike out, the personal consequences -- unemployment -- would be no worse than under a prudent liquidation.
Mr. Rosenzweig, along with Michael Bradley of the University of Michigan, contends that managers' incentives are so distorted that Chapter 11 wastes more capital than would a system of virtually automatic liquidation. Indeed, they say that the burst of bankruptcy filings by large companies in the 1980's was partly a response to the attractions of Chapter 11 after its liberalization in 1978.
In a 1992 article in the Yale Law Journal entitled "The Untenable Case For Chapter 11," they proposed that stockholders and junior creditors be given the opportunity to come up with the cash to pay off secured creditors, thereby taking control of the bankrupt company, or face the speedy sale of assets and the likelihood of walking away empty-handed, since they are the last on the chain of claims in a bankruptcy case.
 
 
Creditors Too Quick to Liquidate
 If managers are typically eager to throw good money after bad, senior creditors are too eager to call in the auctioneer, asserts Oliver Hart, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Consider a bank with first claim on $100 million owed by a bankrupt company that still has $200 million in liquid assets. If the company is sold or dismantled immediately, the bank is sure to recoup the $100 million. On the other hand, if the corporation is given leeway to restructure, $100 million is still the most the bank can get -- and it may take much longer and the bank may get far less.
Mr. Hart, along with Philippe Aghion of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and John Moore of the London School of Economics, offers a creative plan for harmonizing competing interests in bankruptcies.
The first step, based on the idea of Lucian Bebchuk of the Harvard Law School, would be to wipe out a bankrupt corporation's debts. Senior creditors would exchange their i.o.u.'s for all the stock; junior creditors and the old stockholders would exchange their claims for options to purchase the stock at a price that would pay off the creditors ahead of them in line.
In the example above, the bank owed $100 million would get all the shares. Junior creditors owed, say, $200 million would get options to buy the shares for $100 million from the bank. The old stockholders, last in line, would get options to buy back all the stock for $300 million -- enough money to make both classes of creditors whole.
Within a few months of a corporation's entering Chapter 11, the court would then be required to solicit bids for the company's assets -- perhaps hiring outside experts to provide objective comparisons of competing bids. With this information in hand, junior creditors and former shareholders would be given a chance to exercise their stock-purchase options, or to sell them to others who think the business is salvageable. Then there would be a vote of the share owners to choose a plan for restructuring or to proceed to liquidation.
 
 
The Case of the Airlines
 Such a plan might at least have reduced the bankruptcy problems ailing the embattled airlines. Eastern and Pan Am expired by degrees on the Chapter 11 resuscitator, while Continental, T.W.A. and America West have lingered for years -- at what some critics say has been disastrous expense to healthy carriers, which have themselves lost billions of dollars in recent years.
Bankrupt carriers "worry only about the cash in the bank today," complained Michael Durham, the chief financial officer of American Airlines. He says this has created a discount mentality that makes it virtually impossible for competitors to maintain fares at levels that will keep them solvent.
Defenders of Chapter 11 would argue that the bankrupt carriers are probably worth more intact than their planes, gates and computers would fetch at auction. And from the broader social perspective, it appears to pay to keep the multibillion-dollar fleets in the air as long as fares cover fuel, maintenance and labor.
The approach advocated by Messrs. Hart, Aghion and Moore would probably have terminated Eastern Airlines long before it had run through $1 billion in Chapter 11. That might have spared Delta Air Lines a punishing fare war for control of routes through Atlanta, and prevented the spread of what Darryl Jenkins, a partner in Aviation Forecasting and Economics of Arlington Va., calls "the bankruptcy virus."
And the pressure to act would probably have accelerated the reorganization of more competitive carriers like Continental and America West, leaving them debt free and far abler to do battle for market share with the other major carriers.
 
 
One Skeptic
 Elizabeth Warren, a visiting professor at the Harvard Law School, expresses reservations about the economists' plan that go well beyond its possible impact on the airline industry. She doubts that a fast-track version of Chapter 11 would force bad managers to shape up. Any change making it less likely that managers of a corporation could retain control in bankruptcy, she says, would also make it less likely they would seek Chapter 11 protection before the company is in irremediable trouble.
Economists also focus on the apparent failure of Chapter 11 to direct corporate capital toward its most productive uses. And the public is repelled by hefty legal fees that ultimately come out of the pockets of creditors. While legal bills, on average, soak up just a few percent of the assets of bankrupt corporations, a small percentage can still mean big money. In the R. H. Macy bankruptcy, for example, lawyers have already hauled away $25 million.
Washington seems likely, at the least, to put more of a legal burden on companies seeking bankruptcy-law protection to show why they deserve more than a year's respite in Chapter 11. But while there is a clamor for some improvement, no fix, quick or slow, is likely to end the debates over who should control failing companies and when creditors should be permitted to cut their losses.

HEADLINE: CLINTON CONTINUES OLD DRUG POLICIES

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
When President Clinton moved into the White House in January, specialists in academia, health care and law enforcement around the country were expecting big changes in the way the Federal Government dealt with the national drug problem.
But Mr. Clinton surprised and disappointed many specialists last week by presenting a $13.04 billion anti-drug budget that offered little change from the widely criticized approach followed for 12 years by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. That approach relied heavily on law enforcement instead of emphasizing rehabilitation and prevention. 
 "What we have here is a budget that says 'business as usual,' " said Dr. LaMond Tullis, a professor of political science at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and a drug policy consultant to the United Nations. "It seems we're going to go on doing things we know don't work."
 
Health-Care Overhaul Cited
 Administration officials said the budget was prepared before a detailed drug strategy could be worked out, and they added that the health-care overhaul being developed under the leadership of Hillary Rodham Clinton was likely to include increased spending for drug treatment.
Even so, specialists pointed out that the budget represented a general statement of the Administration's plans for the coming year. Regardless of the outcome of the new health-care measures, they said, the budget suggests no major change in philosophy and offers no hope of stanching what many regard as the waste of tens of millions of dollars on ineffective law-enforcement measures.
While Mr. Clinton has devoted considerable energy to the economy and has made general health care a priority, he has been virtually silent on the drug problem and has not chosen the official who will be in charge of developing strategy.
As a result, specialists say Mr. Clinton's handling of the budget has deepened their concern that the new Administration is neglecting the fight against drugs.
While departing little from his predecessor's spending policies, Mr. Clinton chose not to adopt Mr. Bush's practice of using the annual presentation of the budget as a means of calling attention to the drug problem. Instead, Mr. Clinton's anti-drug program was inconspicuously tucked into two pages among the more than 1,300 pages of the Federal budget.
Besides not yet appointing a director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy to serve as his senior anti-drug aide, Mr. Clinton has also left most other Federal positions in the field in the hands of acting directors or holdovers from the Bush Administration.
During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton raised the hopes of drug experts by saying he favored treatment on demand, which would make drug rehabilitation available to anyone who asks for it and would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. At present, the nation's drug treatment centers can handle only about a third of the estimated six million heavy drug abusers.
 
Appointments Praised
 The drug experts say they have been encouraged by Mr. Clinton's appointments of Janet Reno as Attorney General and Dr. Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General, both of whom are regarded as understanding the nuances of the drug problem.
The staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which was President Bush's center for anti-drug information, is referring inquiries about the Clinton Administration's drug policy to the White House. But Arthur L. Jones, a deputy White House press secretary, said that details would not be forthcoming until the President selected the chief drug policy aide.
He could not say when that selection might come. And he would not comment on reports that several people had declined the nomination since the drug office, in an economizing step earlier this year, was cut by five-sixths -- to 25 staff members from 147 -- and the director's post was simultaneously elevated to Cabinet rank.
Cocaine and most other drugs are not being talked about as much as they were just a few years ago, when they attained a certain chic in some middle-class circles. But crack is still a crippling problem in the inner cities and heroin abuse is on the rise, Federal studies indicate.
"This is not a time when we can pull back and say the drug problem is over," said Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical School who resigned as Mr. Bush's senior aide on anti-drug health issues after failing to win $1 billion more for treatment, research and anti-drug education.
 
Questions and More Questions
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, asserted that the Administration, pressed on concerns like the economy and the turmoil in Russia, was simply ignoring illegal drugs.
"There is absolutely nobody in the Administration willing to accept any responsibility on any subject relating to our drug problem," said Mr. Rangel, who was chairman of the recently eliminated House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control and is now a leader of the newly formed House Caucus on Drug Abuse. "They haven't the foggiest idea where the Administration is heading. I've got a letter on my desk from the President of Colombia asking me if I can share with him as to the direction in which the Administration is going on this."
William S. Smith, a senior official in the White House anti-drug office under President Bush, said national drug policy appeared to be "on cruise control."
Robert O. Boorstin, another White House spokesman, said that rather than being ignored drug abuse and treatment had been "part and parcel of one of the working groups" on the President's Task Force on National Health Care, headed by Mrs. Clinton. One possibility being explored, other Administration officials said, is extending drug treatment coverage to the 50 percent of the nation's poor who do not receive the coverage provided through Medicaid.
In his new budget, Mr. Clinton designated $8.30 billion for law enforcement and $4.74 billion for such things as rehabilitation and anti-drug education. That is a proportional split of 63.66 percent to 36.34 percent, or about one percent more for health and education than Mr. Bush in his last drug budget.
Among the most criticized aspects of the Reagan-Bush drug policies were the expensive and largely unsuccessful efforts to stop overseas farmers from producing the raw material for cocaine and opium and to block the smuggling of the drugs into the United States.
Mr. Clinton cut financing for some international operations in South America and Asia by 8 percent. That will trim $44 million from spending last year of $536 million. But he added $19 million for anti-smuggling efforts, bringing spending in that category to $1.765 billion, much of it going to the Defense Department.
In his last year in office, Mr. Bush cut $336 million from international operations and anti-smuggling efforts. He increased spending for drug treatment $168 million while Mr. Clinton is proposing a $170 million increase.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice, which oversees the Drug Enforcement Administration, said that by increasing the total anti-drug budget by 7 percent Mr. Clinton was showing his commitment to the issue.
Mark A. R. Kleiman, a drug expert at Harvard University, said that with $850 billion being spent on national health care, the reforms being developed by Mrs. Clinton could become far more important than the anti-drug budget. "If drug treatment could get a small fraction of what the country spends on health care," he said, "that would be much better than having a big fraction of the drug budget."

HEADLINE: Russia Seeks to Delay Vote on Further Sanctions Against Belgrade

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 11

 BODY:
Russia pressed tonight for further postponement of a Security Council vote planned for Monday on tightening the economic embargo against Yugoslavia, diplomats said.
Consultations continued between Council members over sanctions that are intended to press what remains of Yugoslavia to use its influence to help end the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Bosnian Serbs have been fighting Muslims and Croats for more than a year. One diplomat involved in the issue thought postponement of the vote was likely, but others said a final decision on whether to proceed with the new sanctions probably would be made on Monday. 
 President Boris N. Yeltsin, who sent a message directly to President Clinton on the matter, said he believes that new Security Council action against the Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia would be unpopular in Russia and could damage his chances of victory in his power struggle with the Parliament, which will reach its climax in a national referendum scheduled for April 25. Russian nationalists feel they have special ties to the Serbs as fellow Slavs and Orthodox Christians.
 
Offered Amendments
 As a result, Russia presented a number of amendments last week that would soften the proposed new sanctions. Some amendments were incorporated into the text of the resolution, which was then accepted by other Council members. But Russia then refused to take a position on the entire resolution, saying Moscow would decide how to vote by Monday.
Russia contends that the government of Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, is showing greater flexibility and is making an effort to persuade Bosnia's Serbs to accept something close to the peace proposals put forward by mediators in the Balkans dispute. The plan was developed by Cyrus R. Vance, who was the representative of the United Nations at that time, and Lord Owen, representing the European Community.
Russia is contending that Serbia's effort should be encouraged rather than punished with further sanctions.
In the past, President Clinton has shown that he considers helping President Yeltsin stay in power a higher priority than applying extra pressure on Belgrade to end the civil war in Bosnia. And the United States has already held up action on the new sanctions twice at Moscow's urging.
 
Met in Washington
 Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, was in Washington over the weekend to talk with top Administration officials about his visit to Belgrade last week.
In Belgrade, Mr. Churkin said he would propose changes to the mediators' plan that would make the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina into ten largely autonomous provinces more acceptable to Bosnian Serbs. Muslims and Croats have accepted the plan in its present form.
At the same time Mr. Churkin warned against "hasty steps and decisions that could produce a reverse effect and simply escalate the Bosnian conflict."
As one of the five permanent Security Council members, Russia can veto any action on fresh sanctions. But these days the five -- the others are Britain, France, the United States and China -- do not call for a vote until they are all ready to see the resolution adopted. No veto has been cast since 1990.
 
Pressure on Belgrade
 The United States, Britain and France, together with the Council's third world members, are pressing for the new sanctions as a means of encouraging Yugoslavia's Serbs to pressure Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan.
Belgrade is doing nothing to stop Bosnian Serbs from tightening their grip on the Muslim town of Srebrenica, driving out the Muslims and completing their campaign of "ethnic cleansing" in this part of Eastern Bosnia.
Under the proposed new sanctions resolution, Yugoslavia's coastal waters would be closed to all shipping, its financial assets overseas confiscated and ships, trucks, trains and planes outside the country impounded. Other steps are planned to prevent certain goods from entering or leaving the country.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Tina Brown's Progress At the New New Yorker

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Despite the lamentations of loyalists last summer that Tina Brown would tart up The New Yorker and destroy its very soul, six months into her tenure as editor in chief, subscription renewals are strong, newsstand sales have doubled, and advertising pages are up a hefty 16 percent just since Jan. 1.
However, what no one knows except S. I. Newhouse, the magazine's owner, and a few top executives at the parent company, Advance Publications Inc., is whether The New Yorker has begun to stanch its losses. Ms. Brown, asked her timetable for turning around The New Yorker economically, replied, "We would like to see it in profit in five years." 
 But whatever the effect on the magazine's finances, Tina Brown's tenure has provided the best theater to come from the world of magazine publishing in a long time.
 
Damping Down an Old Flame
 For better or worse, she has made it clear that the 68-year-old New Yorker, which some enthusiasts call the best-loved magazine in America, will not be the same again.
Since her first issue, dated Oct. 5, Ms. Brown has introduced sections, expanded the table of contents, hired new writers, put bylines at the top of articles, increased the use of color through comics and vivid sketches, and made splashier use of cartoons. She has reintroduced the magazine's original body type and an array of decorative art, including logos and other ornamentation, from the days of its founding editor, Harold Ross.
She hired Richard Avedon as the first staff photographer, and his striking pictures brought drama enough to the magazine even before his full-page nudes of the actress Tilde Swinton appeared in the March 8 issue.
Ms. Brown, British-born and 39, has caused clamor and comment, much of the latter mixed.
Supporters say that Ms. Brown, until last summer editor in chief of Vanity Fair, has brought life, topicality and change of pace to a moribund magazine.
Her detractors see vulgarization, a loss of elegance and of timelessness, and, perhaps the harshest criticism of all, an increasing lack of differentiation from other publications.
"It has become much livelier, more interesting, more topical," said Maynard Parker, editor of Newsweek. "I think she has done a good job of reinventing the magazine while keeping much of what was good."
But Lewis Lapham, editor of Harper's, deplored a new trendiness. "She is taking it in the direction of a fashion magazine and presenting what's fashionable in culture and politics," he said. "Her competitors are now Mirabella, Vogue and Vanity Fair."
The fact is that Ms. Brown, faced with the daunting task of attracting new readers while not losing old ones, has probably made changes less rapidly than some feared she would and more rapidly than those who thought she would not change it fast enough.
"She has set out to appeal to a larger audience, one that will draw a larger circulation," said John Mack Carter, editor in chief of Good Housekeeping. "And when you appeal to a broader base, you run the risk of being coarser than a magazine as polished as The New Yorker was previously perceived."
Ms. Brown, tossing her blond hair and speaking intently, dismissed much of the criticism.
"Rubbish!" she said. "It's that New Yorker fakery! Anyone who talks about the lack of timelessness isn't reading the magazine. If they were reading it, they would see that the pieces I'm publishing are exactly those kinds of pieces that were previously published, but are now being mixed up with other kinds of pieces."
 
A Tradition of Long Articles
 Charles McGrath, the deputy editor, who worked under Ms. Brown's two immediate predecessors, Robert Gottlieb and William Shawn, agrees for the most part. He says that many of the long articles -- some of these 25,000 to 30,000 words despite all the talk of shorter pieces -- would have appeared under Mr. Shawn or Mr. Gottlieb.
He thinks many critics are responding more to the new layout than to the content. "The magazine has added or expanded its range," he said. "I would say that the magazine is even more unlike other magazines than it used to be."
A constant complaint is the increased use of obscenity or vulgarity, which, Mr. McGrath said, began when Mr. Shawn was editor. "Under Shawn, one had to go and negotiate every time," he said. "Under Bob, the rules relaxed a little."
 
Of WASP's and Authenticity
 About all this Ms. Brown said, "I think that you cannot have street people talking like Connecticut WASP's, and we have done a number of pieces on street people."
Some things, she conceded, she would not do again, including an unsigned Talk of the Town column defending Erich Honecker, the ousted East German Communist leader, in the Jan. 11 issue. The article, it turns out, was written by Irene Dische, the wife of Mr. Honecker's lawyer.
"She had written for The New Yorker before, so questions were not asked that should have been asked," Ms. Brown said.
She said it has taken a long time to get The Talk of The Town section to hit its stride, but thinks it has now. "It had become too much of a belles-lettres wannabe and E. B. White manque," she said, referring to the great New Yorker writer. 'My feeling is if you don't have E. B. White, then don't have E. B. White manque."
As for the Valentine cover of a Hasidic man kissing a black woman, which many found offensive, she said simply that it was her best-selling cover.
Roger Angell, the writer and fiction editor, described The New Yorker these days as "a cheerful and interesting place to work."
"I also think there is general agreement that she is the first non-neurotic editor The New Yorker has ever had," he said.
 
Encouraging Numbers
 As for the magazine's financial performance, Steven T. Florio, president and chief executive, talks of "a huge, huge turnaround."
Circulation for the last six months of 1992 (the first three of those months under Mr. Gottlieb) was 659,000, up 5 percent over 1991, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Mr. Florio projects an average of 750,000 for the first half of 1993 and says he will raise the 600,000 circulation base the magazine guarantees advertisers, to 650,000 in July.
Bookings for ad pages for the second quarter, he said, are 20 percent ahead of last year's, although that does not necessarily translate into an equivalent increase in revenue.
Newsstand sales average 45,000 an issue, compared with 20,000 in 1992, partly because of increased promotion. And the most recent survey shows that the average age of readers has dropped from 45.7 to 42.
Subscription renewals, the best barometer of how longtime readers feel about the new New Yorker, are at 71.8 percent, strikingly high for a magazine. Mr. Florio said he had received about 400 cancellations. One woman canceled her subscription, saying she did not like what Tina Brown had done to The New Yorker. The letter, however, was written about a month before Ms. Brown took over.
Expenses are being watched closely, Mr. Florio said. Advance Publications, a privately held company, does not discuss its finances, but industry estimates are that The New Yorker was losing $10 million a year.
The magazine has nonetheless made a major investment in upgraded paper stock, which is heavier, brighter and better able to accommodate the increased use of color. People in the industry estimate the cost at something less than $3 million a year.
Another big expense has been for severance packages given to 15 writers whose contracts were quietly terminated. They were each given a year's salary and lifetime medical benefits. (New contract writers do not receive benefits.)
Ms. Brown said that generally speaking, she is paying writers less at The New Yorker than she did at Vanity Fair. Many of those she brought over from Vanity Fair are being paid the same amount for more work. Even a superstar like Richard Avedon, who reportedly turned down a $2 million contract from Hearst Magazines, is working for The New Yorker "as an artistic commitment," in Ms. Brown's words, and not for the kind of fee he usually commands.
Ms. Brown will clearly continue to make waves. She will be cheered by many. But she will probably never erase the unease of old-time readers who consider topicality declasse and see her stewardship as tantamount to selling out to the Philistines.
 
A Dissent Over Taste
 In no area is this more evident than in the matter of taste. Joseph Epstein, editor of The American Scholar, writing under the nom de plume Aristides in the spring issue, declared:
"When good taste is removed, one feels the loss rather dramatically. A strong case in point is the changes that have taken place in recent years at The New Yorker magazine since the removal from the magazine's editorship of William Shawn.
"Read the magazine today, with its unbuttoned and often sloppy language, its edge of political meanness, the childish obviousness of its attempts to outrage, and one comes to yearn for the quiet good taste that could once be counted on in a magazine one has been reading for decades."
The criticism, to be sure, is aimed at both of Mr. Shawn's successors, Mr. Gottlieb and Ms. Brown. But let Ms. Brown have the last word.
"Well, you know there is a lot of faux Puritanism out there," she said. "It's all part of the New Yorker fakery. Good taste in the prissy sense has never been of interest to me."

HEADLINE: Traveling Miami Roads Without Becoming Prey

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 11

 BODY:
As tourists wait in line for their cars at an Alamo Rent-a-Car office near Miami International Airport, they are given a flier and hear a recorded message that repeats a warning about the dangers lurking ahead.
"We have just handed you a safety-tip brochure," a woman's voice calmly intones every five minutes. "We ask that you read it before leaving the premises." 
 In stark letters, drivers are warned against actions that once might have been routine: pulling over if urged to by a passing motorist or getting out to check for damage if bumped from behind by another car.
But the conditions are no longer routine. Criminals here and elsewhere appear to be increasingly finding motorists easy prey, and they are using a variety of tactics to assault and rob.
 
'Flow of Potential Targets'
 "Roads are perfect for criminals because they offer easy access, fast escape and a constant flow of potential targets," said Louis R. Mizzell Jr., a security consultant in Bethesda, Md., who collects information about crimes against motorists.
Two weeks ago, a German tourist was killed after leaving the Miami airport when her rental car was bumped from behind and she got out to inspect it. The woman, Barbara Jensen Meller, a victim of a tactic known as "bump and rob," was robbed, beaten and run over. Three men have been arrested in connection with the incident.
Other motorists have been victims of "smash and grab" attacks in which a robber approaches a stopped car, shatters a window with a hard object, snatches valuables from inside and runs. Many of the attacks here have occurred after drivers, like Mrs. Meller, became lost and wandered into rundown neighborhoods.
Statistics on crimes against motorists are hard to come by, although police officers interviewed here say it is their impression that such attacks have increased over the last two years. And the problem, while severe here, is by no means limited to the Miami area.
 
Tactics Aren't New
 Mr. Mizzell said that last year he had received reports of 3,000 bump-and-rob incidents from across the country.
Some police officials say growing concern about the safety of motorists is largely one of perception, created by an increase in vivid news accounts of carjackings and similar incidents.
And, in fact, tactics like bump and rob have been around for years. In a three-month period in 1989, for example, 10 motorists were robbed along Interstate 280 in New Jersey when they pulled their cars off the highway after being bumped from behind.
In Miami, such attacks have drawn particular attention lately because many of the victims have been tourists, especially from outside the country, who help make up a vital element of the state's economy.
Some visitors interviewed this weekend said they were not concerned about driving, but others have changed their travel plans.
"We were planning to tour around the city for a few days," said Ross Townsend, who owns a moving company in Alberta, Canada, as he and his wife waited to pick up a rental car at the Alamo office near the Miami airport. "But I can tell you, we are more than just a little worried. We are just going to drive straight on out of here."
Public and corporate officials have made efforts to calm such fears. In addition to the safety brochures, rental companies are replacing the license plates that previously designated a car as a rented vehicle. Law-enforcement agencies have formed undercover units intended to catch criminals who prey on motorists.
On Saturday night, for example, Officer Jorge Martin of the Miami Police Department patrolled the Overtown district, a blighted neighborhood that borders the affluent downtown area. It is a maze of badly lit streets where tourists often find themselves after missing a poorly marked entrance to Interstate 95.
 
'A Dead Giveaway'
 "People drive right past the ramp and in two blocks they are in the middle of it," Officer Martin said. "Then, they drive around with maps pulled out or luggage piled up in the back seat. It is a dead giveaway."
Officials here have vowed to put up new road signs.
As part of a new unit formed several weeks ago, Officer Martin is on the street to find lost motorists. He and other Miami officers estimated that for the last two years about 10 motorists a night, 80 percent of them tourists, were attacked in their vehicles in Overtown after getting lost. The majority of the incidents involved smash-and-grab attacks by teen-agers who waited on a dark corner or by an underpass.
On Saturday night, a bright new vehicle with rental-car plates and luggage visible in the back seat appeared ahead of Officer Martin's car, hesitantly making its way down an Overtown street. The vehicle's occupants, a couple from Norway, had become lost trying to find the airport.
"I'm following this map from Avis, and it is not good enough," said Reidulf Stige, a travel agent from Grimstad, Norway, . Officer Martin guided him out of the neighborhood.
Over five hours, Officer Martin did the same with five other motorists, four of them tourists.
Thomas Culpepper, the managing director of traffic safety for the American Automobile Association in Heathrow, Fla., said that drivers should clearly study maps and obtain directions before they travel in unfamiliar areas and that they should be aware of tactics like "bump and rob."
If motorists believe they have been involved in an accident, he said, they should drive to a police or fire station or any well-lighted area where there are people around before getting out of their cars.

Tourist Robbed and 3 Arrested
 MIAMI, April 11 (Reuters) -- A Dade County official who saw a man rob a Venezuelan woman at a gas station in Miami alerted the police on his car phone and two men and a woman were arrested, the police said today. The official, Commissioner Art Teele, alerted the police after he saw a thief jump from a car and grab a purse from the woman, Nancy Semprun of Caracas, Venezuela, as she was buying gasoline for her rented car.

HEADLINE: Executive Brief: THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT;
Bentsen Remembers Way Around the Hill

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
The Lloyd Bentsen who is Treasury Secretary is proving to be little different from the Lloyd Bentsen who was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
Mr. Bentsen, his colleagues report, remains a good listener, still knows how to horse-trade and has not lost his knack at pushing the right button at the right time to move legislation along. 
 Take last week's Senate vote to increase the $4.145 trillion debt ceiling. In past years, raising the ceiling was an inglorious occasion for Congressional grandstanding, sniping, posturing and shaking down the President. But this year, notwithstanding the filibuster over President Clinton's $19.5 billion plan to speed up economic growth, the debt-ceiling increase sailed through the Senate, thanks in part to Mr. Bentsen's well-timed lobbying.
And although Mr. Bentsen was chosen as Treasury Secretary partly because he knew his way around Congress, Administration officials do not fault him for failing to prevent Senate Republicans from bogging down the spending package.
Mr. Bentsen has not forgotten the importance of compromising around the edges to help win approval of the big enchiladas, like the President's economic package.
An example: The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, and other New England senators voiced their displeasure with the proposed energy tax because it placed a higher levy on oil than other fuels. That would squeeze New Englanders, who tend to heat their homes with oil. Presto, the Administration announced that oil used for home heating face a lower levy.
The testing of Mr. Bentsen will begin in earnest over the next few weeks when Congress starts dissecting the economic package. The first hurdle may be the highest: the President's proposal for the investment tax credit, a $21 billion tax break that represents half of his spending package. Senior lawmakers said last week that the proposal had little support in either chamber.
And after that comes the tax increases. "A $272 billion tax increase is a doozy," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee. "If Lloyd doesn't help, there won't be one."
 
Old Faces,
Better Offices
 When one walks around the austere halls of the Treasury Department, it is hard not to bump into people who worked with Mr. Bentsen in the Senate. He has taken a dozen Senate aides to the columned building next to the White House.
Mr. Bentsen has probably moved faster than other Cabinet Secretaries to assemble a team of aides, but then again he had a large pool of respected aides to choose from.
Among the aides who have made the pilgrimage to Treasury is Marina Weiss, who was the Senate Finance Committee's chief analyst for health and human resources and is now deputy assistant secretary of economic policy for health issues. Samuel Sessions, the committee's chief tax counsel, is deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis. Philip Diehl, who was Mr. Bentsen's legislative director, is now his personal counselor.
Mr. Bentsen has also named Jack R. DeVore Jr., his longtime press secretary, to be assistant secretary for public affairs.
These Senate transplants acknowledge they must be far more careful about what they say and do than when they were on Capitol Hill. If a Congressional aide says something about the yen's value, no one cares, but if a Treasury official talks about the yen, currency traders will do somersaults.
"When the Treasury speaks out on an issue, it has enormous consequences, certainly more than I imagined," Mr. DeVore said.
 
Theory? Theory?
Oh, THAT Theory
 Mr. Bentsen got more controversy than he bargained for in naming two star economists to senior posts.
Lawrence Summers, his choice for under secretary for international affairs, has become a punching bag for environmentalists ever since he wrote a memorandum, as the World Bank's chief economist, suggesting that it made economic sense to move dirty industries to third-world countries, which worry less about pollution than the industrialized countries.
Alicia Munnell, who has been nominated as assistant secretary for economic policy, stirred up a hornet's nest when, as research director for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, she called for taxing increases in the value of union pension plans, individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans every year.
Republicans senators, fearful that this idea would sabotage the retirement saving system, are threatening to grill Ms. Munnell when her confirmation hearing is held over the next few weeks. Mr. Bentsen has not embraced her idea, and few analysts think he ever will because it would be political suicide.
And Mr. Summers, a longtime Harvard economics professor, faced considerable heat from environmentalists and a few senators at his hearings last month.
In one of those peculiarly Washington scenes, by the time one of his confirmation hearings was over environmentalists had littered the room with hundreds of leaflets denouncing him, while he had changed his tune to sound like the best friend the environmentalists ever had.
The lesson: provocative ideas that make for good debates in academe are not always so welcome in the halls of power.

HEADLINE: Fortunes and Fear in Mexican Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Although still not totally comfortable with the volatility of the Mexican stock market, more United States investors are taking Mexico's stocks seriously, hoping for long-term returns and the completion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Despite the Mexican market's lackluster performance this year, and despite the worries of some about the outcome of the nation's next election and even about economic stability, analysts remain optimistic about the Mexican stock market. They expect several more years of solid growth. 
 Foreign investors, most from the United States, have grown increasingly comfortable putting money into Mexican stocks. Such investment soared last year to $27 billion, up from slightly more than $4.2 billion in 1991. Investment activity has moderated a bit this year, but foreigners still account for nearly 20 percent of the market's total capitalization and more than half its trading volume.
 
Stunning Returns
 The Bolsa Mexicana de Valores -- literally the "Mexican sack of values" -- is already Latin America's largest stock exchange in terms of capitalization, or the number of shares multiplied by their value. And for more than a decade, it has been one of the best-performing stock markets in the world, some analysts say. The market, as tracked by The Financial Times of London, is 10 times its level in 1982.
"There has been some reluctance to investing in Mexico until recently, but investors have finally realized that our economy has slowed down, whereas in Mexico the prospect for higher returns remains much greater," said David G. Marshall, a senior research analyst at the Investment Placement Group of San Diego, a management company.
Large investment fund companies like Kemper Financial Companies; Scudder, Stevens & Clark; Fidelity Investments, and Capital Research Managers have become major Mexican players, investing heavily in both equities and fixed-rate investments. At the same time, midsize investors like the Investment Placement Group and pension funds like the State of Wisconsin Investment Board have been drawn to Mexico by its slowing inflation and consistent growth.
"Technically, Mexico is still considered an emerging market," said Kathleen M. Harris, who manages the $1 billion international equity portfolio of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which has substantially increased its Mexican holdings over the last three years. "But from the standpoint of how we view it currently, we tend to think of it as being a not expensive market that still has some attractive risk-reward situations."
 
Inherent Risks Seen
 The risks, however, can be substantial. "The long-term prospects are outstanding," said Mr. Marshall of the Investment Placement Group, which controls about $70 million in Mexico, "but you have to deal with the short-term volatility."
Although the Bolsa is the eighth-largest exchange in the world in capitalization, it is essentially a very thin market, tied to the performance of a few large companies.
A few more than 180 stocks are listed, compared with more than 1,600 on the New York Stock Exchange. Telefonos de Mexico, widely known as Telmex, the national telecommunications monopoly, is capitalized at about 25 percent of the total Bolsa value, and its fortunes count heavily in the Bolsa's 38-share index.
Most analysts expect the exchange to be influenced by politics both in the United States and in Mexico for the rest of the year. There is the debate now in the United States over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Then, there is the matter of the Mexican governing party's selection of its candidate to run in next year's presidential election.
Analysts are split over the possibility of a major devaluation of the peso. But many believe that the high interest rates that have restricted credit and strapped the Bolsa will be lowered later in the year in an attempt to bolster the economy just as the presidential candidate of the governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is announced in November.
The PRI's candidate is favored to win the election; no Mexican President since 1929 has come from the opposition, although the leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, made a strong run for the presidency in 1988.
Some of the largest investors have been willing to overlook the Bolsa's many slips and dips, which can be set off by a rumor about Telmex or a proposed change in Government policy. "At the moment we're pretty unambiguously optimistic about investment in Mexico," said A. Peter Monaco, portfolio manager for the Scudder Latin America Fund, which has more than $500 million in Mexico.
Mexican companies and United States investors have benefited greatly from the recent growth in American depository receipts, negotiable certificates based on United States dollars that represent a foreign company's stock and can be traded in the United States.
Investments by Americans in Mexican stocks have largely been in a handful of big companies, led by Telmex. The phone company's depository receipts were the seventh most actively traded issue in the United States in 1992.
Nearly 465 million shares of Telmex -- with a dollar volume exceeding $23 billion -- were traded on the New York Stock Exchange last year, according to the Bank of New York.
 
Some Other Big Companies
 The receipts of five other large Mexican companies are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. One concern, Tubos de Acero de Mexico, a large manufacturing company that makes pipes and tubes, is listed on the American Stock Exchange.
"Dealing in the Mexican market has become almost commonplace," said Timothy C. Davis, a vice president for emerging markets at Lazard Freres & Company. "There is a lot of Mexican volume trading between New York institutions. You don't need the Mexican Bolsa anymore to trade share purchases. In many ways, the Bolsa is moving to New York."
Until recently, many Americans seemed willing to buy anything with Mexico in its name. The Bolsa rose sharply through much of the 1980's, more than doubled in value in 1991, and started 1992 with a 30 percent jump. But then it went into a free fall over the political uncertainty of the Presidential election in the United States and concerns about the trade agreement, which would wipe away most tariffs on goods moving among Canada, Mexico and the United States. Much of that lost value was regained after Bill Clinton was elected and he expressed tempered support for the accord if side agreements that protect United States interests could be negotiated.
 
A Winning Play
 The first Mexican stock in many portfolios was Telmex. Anyone who bought the stock in 1988, when its shares were available on Nasdaq, for less than $3 and sold when Telmex, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, reached its peak of $60 in February 1992, made a ton of money.
"Telmex really represented for a lot of people the Mexican economic success," said Eduardo M. Cabrera, manager of Latin American Equity Research at Merrill Lynch & Company. But anyone who bought Telmex in early 1992, hoping that the rise would continue and believing that the free trade pact would be quickly enacted, has lost money. The Telmex A.D.R. is now trading at $54.
Aeromexico, which practically has an aviation monopoly, once seemed a sure bet, but has floundered. Its stock sold last summer for $16 a share, and has since dropped as low as $5. Tubos de Mexico and Grupo Gigante of Mexico, which sells food and general merchandise and operates restaurants, are poor performers of late.
Although investors worry about Mexico's growing current accounts deficit -- which is forecast to reach $22 billion this year -- investors are encouraged by recent corporate decisions. Anheuser-Busch, for example, recently agreed to take a $477 million stake in one of Mexico's largest brewing companies, Grupo Modelo, which makes Corona beer. Grupo Modelo executives have said they are planning the company's first public offering, perhaps by the end of this year.

HEADLINE: As Tax Day Nears, a Kinder I.R.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
They just don't make April 15 the way they used to.
Thursday is still the deadline for filing personal income tax returns, and yes, there are still penalties for people who don't file or who don't pay what they owe. 
 But the Internal Revenue Service has made changes this year that should ease the seasonal panic of the dilatory, the disorderly and the accounting-impaired.
The changes have moved the long-feared agency further than ever toward encouraging people to pay what they owe voluntarily. For the past several years, faced with 10 million people who don't file each year, the agency's leaders have spoken of the importance of putting forward a more sympathetic face. This year, there are more conciliatory rules behind the smile.
 
Borrowing From the I.R.S.
 The new rules make it easier to file for an automatic four-month extension of the deadline, as about 5 million people do every year. They also make it simpler for most people to legally put off paying what they owe, effectively borrowing from the I.R.S. and paying in installments. And they provide a way for taxpayers in financial distress to negotiate compromises that actually reduce the amount they must pay.
"It is clearly a taxpayer-friendly type of approach," said William J. Goldberg, national director of personal financial planning for KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm.
At I.R.S. headquarters in Washington, a steady stream of taxpayers came and went on Friday, many of them picking up either Form 4868, the application for a filing extension, or Form 9465, which is used to request installment payments of taxes owed.
Sandra Gould, 41, who works for the Federal Aviation Administration, said she was there to apply for an extension. She said that she had just moved to Washington from Missouri, did not have all the paperwork she needed to file on time, and had considered not filing at all this year until she learned that she could do so without paying her estimated tax next week.
"That gave me the incentive to file for the extension," she said.
Charlie Ingram, who works at the Treasury Department, was planning to request the installment plan. "I'm going to file on time, give them some money, and tell them I'll pay the rest later," he said.
Officials said that it is still advisable to pay as much as possible as soon as possible -- and extremely important to file for any extension by April 15.
Late applications for extensions are invalid, subjecting taxpayers to the agency's full penalties for failing to file and ruling out the use of several dozen important tax breaks when the return is eventually filed. For example, a couple who fail to obtain a valid extension may not later include their child's dividend income on their own return; their mistake may spawn a juvenile tax delinquent. And a self-employed person who files late without a valid extension cannot deduct contributions to a Keogh retirement plan.
So far this year, the I.R.S. has received about 5 million fewer tax returns than at the same time last year. I.R.S. officials speculated that many people have delayed filing their returns after discovering that they will not get their customary refund this year -- or that they may even owe tax -- because of changes in the tax withholding formulas instituted last year by the Bush Administration in an effort to pump cash into the economy.
Ellen Murphy, the I.R.S. spokesman, said the agency was aware of the refund drought when it changed some of its rules last week, but that the purpose of the change was to dissuade taxpayers from neglecting to file just because they couldn't afford to pay right away.
 
Interest Charges Still Apply
 The decision to let delayed filers pay later was announced on Wednesday. The I.R.S. said that this is the first year it would accept an application for the automatic four-month extension of the deadline even if the taxpayer could not not pay what is owed with the application.
In the past, an application filed without a check for any tax due would be rejected. The I.R.S. would consider the tax return delinquent and assess a penalty of 5 percent each month on the balance due, up to 25 percent.
Even with the extension, there are interest charges of 7 percent on any taxes paid after April 15. If payments made by April 15 are less than 90 percent of the total tax, there is also a monthly late-payment penalty of five-tenths of a percent of the unpaid taxes. Together, those charges would be equivalent to a 13 percent annual interest rate on delayed payments.
Financial advisers say it is probably more sensible to borrow the owed amount from a bank than from the Government. By paying interest to the I.R.S., however, "you don't have to make a credit application and you don't have to fill out a financial statement, and it may be your only source of credit," Mr. Goldberg said.
This year, any taxpayer who owes less than $10,000 will have an easier time obtaining an agreement for paying in installments. When the debt is that small, the I.R.S. will not file liens against delinquent taxpayers, and the payment schedules can be approved routinely by officials at regional I.R.S. offices.
Form 9465 lets taxpayers propose their own terms for periodic payments. The I.R.S. would not say what kinds of offers it would consider reasonable, but anyone who offered to pay a few thousand dollars, plus interest, in monthly payments over less than two years would be likely to get the deal approved, officials said. The average installment agreement is for about $2,300 paid over 20 months.
Taxpayers who find that they did not have enough taxes withheld last year should file new W-4 forms with their employers to correct the problem. But a taxpayer in arrears cannot simply increase withholding as a way of paying the I.R.S. under an installment plan.
However, a taxpayer can propose that the I.R.S. put a modest levy on a paycheck. The agency would contact the employer and the periodic payments of overdue taxes would then be withheld automatically.
Last year, installment payment agreements increased 47 percent, and collections from installment agreements went up 27 percent, the I.R.S. said. The numbers are still relatively small, however; so far this year, the agency has received about 100,000 requests for installment payments.
Taxpayers are also choosing more frequently to negotiate a compromise payment, which the I.R.S. will accept in cases where there is virtually no hope of ever collecting the full amount owed. That process requires detailed financial statements and usually a meeting with a revenue agent.

HEADLINE: Greenwich Feels Pain of Change

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., April 9

 BODY:
If the Disney people wanted to update Main Street, U.S.A., they might copy Greenwich Avenue, a broad, sloping street of historic storefronts where police officers, not traffic lights, direct cars through busy intersections.
D. W. Rogers, descended from a local general store, is a neighbor of F. W. Woolworth. Boswell's, Finch's and Grannick's pharmacies endure. But Victoria's Secret and Banana Republic are also neighbors, and each end of the avenue is now anchored by an office plaza. 
 Greenwich Avenue may already be a Disney-like illusion, in which the old and new seem to coexist peaceably. And its changing face is just part of the price that this wealthy Fairfield County community is paying for its transformation in the 1970's and 80's from small town to small city.
Now that the diaspora of corporations from Manhattan appears over, towns that welcomed their buildings and tax revenues are learning the true costs. In Greenwich, a looming property-tax increase has made clear that office buildings are not financial saviors. Too late, some residents are also concluding that the tax revenues are not worth the loss of harbor views, or the traffic congestion, or the opening of this serene community to the more harried world around it.
In a town that has long clung to a simpler image of itself than its population (58,400), wealth (per-capita income: $46,000) or better-known residents (Ivan Lendl, Ivana Trump, Tom Seaver) might suggest, second-guessing is common.
"I have the feeling that I'm sitting in a lawyer's office at the reading of a will, and everybody in the family is fighting about who got what and who didn't get what," said the First Selectman, John B. Margenot Jr.
The immediate cause of distress is a townwide revaluation of real estate, which Connecticut requires every 10 years for assessing property taxes. Ten years is a lifetime in real estate, so a revaluation can put a decade's changes in perspective with a jolt.
The revaluation found that houses had increased in value much more than offices, battered more by the recession. Commercial property now makes up 18.4 percent of the tax roll and pays $23 million in taxes; the revaluation reduces it to 12.0 percent and $15.5 million.
Homeowners will make up the difference. So while the taxes on the headquarters of U.S. Tobacco could fall 40 percent, to $261,800 from $442,755, taxes on small subdivision houses are to increase 20 to 30 percent, to around $2,500, from $2,000.
Many estates will see larger increases. On Field Point Circle on Long Island Sound, the increases range up to 100 percent, raising some taxes to more than $40,000 a year.
Compared with many towns, Greenwich will still have low taxes, despite a $160 million budget that supports excellent schools and amenities like 1,400 acres of parks and four beaches, including an island in Long Island Sound served by a municipal ferry. (Because more than 3,000 property owners challenged the new assessments, the town has delayed them until next year).
And Greenwich, while becoming home to American Can, U.S. Tobacco, Chesebrough-Pond's and other corporations, imposed building restrictions early, sending Xerox and other companies on to more willing Stamford.
The building boom ended here by 1980, and through the 80's the offices seemed to pay their way. The main cost, to many people, was the long lines of traffic caused by 20,000 commuters.
"I think most people are satisfied that we've maintained the scale of the town and limited large-scale development," said the town planner, James Sandy. "The residential property has become so valuable because we have maintained the scale."
The revaluation, however, has revived the 70's debates over allowing office development.
"The leaders of the town would say, 'This is a benefit, it will keep your tax rate low, they will not use any services, they will not use the school system, they will pay a fair share,' " recalled June Curley, a real-estate agent who has lived here since 1956.
"Nobody said to us that if they don't make the revenue they expect, you the taxpayer will have to pick up the slack," she said.
Many people regret the transformation of Greenwich over the last 10 years, when a community of nearly 60,000 people that felt like a small town suddenly, while losing population, started to feel like a small city.
Streets were widened, traffic lights installed, and yet traffic worsened. Local stores closed while national chains moved in. School enrollment dropped but the town budget swelled.
Mr. Margenot, whose family owns commercial property in Greenwich, says the corporations did help Greenwich keep its tax rate low, if only because the alternative -- more housing -- would have demanded more from the town's services and schools.
"Basically the town maintained the kind of life that we've always had," he said.
The shifting tax burden will cause pain; Greenwich has working-class families, a large middle class, retirees, and plenty of residents who are nervous about their jobs. Yet such tax shifts are common in revaluations, and have been even more extreme in poorer cities, like New Haven, and cities more dependent on commercial property, like Stamford.
Here, many people are looking at the revaluation as a warning that Greenwich must change even more, to preserve what it values most.
"Just like G.M. and I.B.M., the day of reckoning comes and somebody has to get serious about management," said George Schiele, the president of a taxpayers' group that is threatening a budget referendum.
That, however, might require remaking Greenwich's small-town government, which divides power among Mr. Margenot, an elected finance board, and a Representative Town Meeting with 230 elected members.
"I guess we do have to decide whether we're a town or a city," said Richard Stefani, the president of the Round Hill neighborhood association.
Mr. Stefani worries that higher taxes may prompt some residents to sell their extra acres to builders, filling in the fields and woodlots.
Ms. Curley worries that higher taxes will speed a trend toward younger families passing by Greenwich for New Canaan or Darien as they move up to larger houses. In their place, she sees more buyers from New York.
Others complain about the out-of-towners on Greenwich Avenue: both the shoppers taking parking spaces, and the stores like The Limited, The Gap and Polo Ralph Lauren that have replaced local merchants.
Parking is a headache, but many residents oppose building garages -- or tiered structures, as they are called here. Why, they ask, should Greenwich pay for city-like garages that will benefit national stores and shoppers from Westchester County?
But the new stores are helping to keep Greenwich Avenue alive while many downtowns die. They attract people who also spend money in the older local stores that define Greenwich for its own residents.
At D. W. Rogers, the clerks still hand-tie the bows on packages, carry bags out to customers' cars, and deliver pajamas to patients at Greenwich Hospital. "We get a lot of people who come out of the city on Saturday," said the owner, Terry Baxendale. "Maybe it's an alternative.
"Some people say, 'If we didn't have the chains, we would still be that quaint little town we were 20 years ago.' I don't necessarily buy that, because nothing remains the same."

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
Yankee Stadium: the Bronx's Diamond in the Rough

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
In the scruffy blocks around Yankee Stadium, spring blossoms today in the form of the Bronx Bombers' home opener.
At Vega Alta Bar at 880 Gerard Avenue, daily receipts will jump from the usual $200 to something like $1,200. At Stadium Hardware next door, the plumbers' helpers in the window will be totally supplanted by Yankees caps and T-shirts. The trade at River Cigars at East 161st Street and River Avenue will perk up, the owner confidently predicts. 
 Equally eager, presumably, are the entrepreneurs who extort $5 or $10 for "watching" your car after you have legally parked it on the street.
"It's a great money-making day," exulted Louie Diamontis, manager of Ball Park Lanes at 810 River Avenue.
 
Reading Mr. Steinbrenner
 The Yankees are locally perceived as a rare golden goose in a borough of street pigeons. The house that Ruth built presides over the nation's poorest Congressional district, near block upon block of dilapidated buildings, teeming streets, bodegas and bars. Many fans scurry from the parking lots to the stadium and back again, fearful of crime.
But they come, a few venturing into the neighborhood, all spending money. "At least there's some legitimate economic activity conducted in the South Bronx," said Henry Stern, president of the Citizens' Union, a government watchdog group.
Given the context, the impact is big. "The Yankees are the hub of the Bronx economy," declared Richard Guidron, chairman of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce.
"If they were to leave, it would take us years to recover," said Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President. "The emotional hole might never be filled."
The concern about possibly itchy Yankee feet, reflected in comments on sports call-in shows as well as unsolicited letters to city officials, is being fired by the return of the principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner, from two and a half years of banishment from baseball.
One of the club's first acts under his renewed leadership was to conduct a poll of season ticket holders asking, among many other things, how they would feel if the club moved from the Bronx.
Club spokesmen say the poll has not been completed, and that it most likely will not be released even when it is. Mr. Steinbrenner himself denied a move is being considered, then added, both impishly and ominously, "Nothing is certain but death and taxes."
 
Team's Importance Debated
 Bronxites can only watch nervously, squinting at elusive tea leaves. "We are all keeping our fingers crossed," said Ed Arigoni, owner of the New York Bus Company as well as a lavish Yankee Stadium box.
"My initial reaction is that it's a negotiating move," said Mr. Ferrer.
The Yankees' lease is scheduled to expire in 2002. Mr. Steinbrenner agreed in October 1987 to extend the lease with the city to 2032 in return for more parking and other improvements, but then neither he nor his agents signed the agreement. Talks are now stalled.
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a self-described baseball hater who is still angry over the collapse of the earlier deal, nonetheless insisted it was in the city's economic interest to take large strides to retain the Yankees. "I think there are intangibles plus tangibles that make it worthwhile to subsidize keeping a major league team in the city," he said in an interview.
Economists who have studied the economic benefits of having a professional sports team are more dubious. "The Yankees are exploiting the city," declared Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economist who has written extensively about the economics of the baseball industry.
"You can't do anything but conclude that stadiums and teams are not likely to create anything in the way of economic activity," said Robert Baade, an economist who has studied the experience of nine cities with baseball teams, measuring retail sales, employment and personal income.
 
A Commercial Anchor
 But Mr. Baade, who teaches at Lake Forest College in Illinois, adds that the politics of helping a baseball club almost always helps incumbents, perhaps explaining the frequency of such largess. He points to a 10 percent jump in the popularity of Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago in 1986 after his administration decided to support a new stadium for the White Sox.
But most people have little doubt that big league ball helps the tattered blocks surrounding Yankee Stadium. Jackie Sanchez, a secretary who lives in the neighborhood, said game days are so much better in the area. "Mucho cops," she said. "And you feel good just looking at the people go by."
"If the Yankees go, nothing would come in" to fill the void, said Steve Manesis, manager of the Unity Coffee Shop at 58 East 161st Street. "All these people around here would go out of business."
Some feel the Yankees' gradual shift to a schedule of almost all night games has worsened business.
Louis Reda, manager of the Yankee Tavern at Gerard and 161st Street, said that after the games, fans were less likely to linger in neighborhood places. "TV is ruling the schedule," he said.
Some business people consider the Yankees largely irrelevant, given that so many fans are afraid to venture into the neighborhood and so few residents of the surrounding area can afford to go to games. "Yankee Stadium doesn't exist," said Abdul Jabbar, who sells incense at the corner of Gerard Avenue and 161st Street and is now putting two children through college. "It's just a statue."
 
A Lesson From Brooklyn
 And others, like Mark Karow, the third-generation owner of Stadium Hardware, think their businesses might actually benefit if Yankee Stadium were replaced by housing projects, as happened to Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds.
"I would have more customers," he said. "The minus would be that I love the Yankees."
It has now been 15 years since Manny's Baseball Land picked up stakes and left its site across the street from the stadium, where it was replaced by Stan the Man's Baseball Land. From a Florida warehouse, Manny's does a nice business under the same name selling Yankee uniforms and other merchandise by mail.
"The Bronx wasn't what it used to be," Ron Meshil, one of the owners, said of the long-ago departure. "But we're still die-hard Yankee fans and always will be."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Price Data and Supply Favor Lower Yields

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Yields in the bond market are likely to move lower, following better inflation news last week than most traders had dared to hope for, and the scheduled release this week of retail sales and industrial-production data that are expected to be sluggish.
While investment markets were closed for Good Friday, the Labor Department was open, and it reported that the Consumer Price Index for March rose only one-tenth of a percent. 
 More startling was that the so-called core rate -- which excludes volatile food and energy costs -- was also up a mere one-tenth of a percent. The day before, a report that core producer prices also rose only one-tenth of a percent set off a buying surge in bonds that pushed down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 6.85 percent.
Tomorrow, the Commerce Department will release the retail sales report for March, and the results are expected to be weak, in part because of the weather. Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities Inc., is forecasting a decline of five-tenths of a percent. And he expects industrial production, which will be reported by the Federal Reserve system on Thursday, to be flat.
"It almost looks like a one-way street," Mr. Fine said. "There is no threat of inflation, weak retail sales and a lackluster industrial production. It seems to me that by this time next week, we will be closer to new lows in yields than we are today."
But will yields break through the lows reached at the beginning of March: 6.72 percent on the 30-year bond and 5.82 percent on the 10-year note? If traders and investors do buy enough bonds and notes to push the yields below those levels, the new rally may have little to do with inflation fears' subsiding for the present.
The likely reason would instead be technical forces that move markets but are often immune to the ups and downs of economic data. Such forces include the pace of Government borrowing and the need for municipalities and other governments to buy Treasury securities as part of the process of paying off older debts that carry higher interest rates.
 
The Supply Variable
 Also playing a role is the currently benign stance of the Federal Reserve. Because of low inflation and the economy's slow growth, there is reason to believe that the central bank will have no cause to raise short-term interest rates any time soon. That removes a lot of the risk in buying longer-term Treasury securities.
One of the technical factors noted by traders and analysts is that the Treasury's borrowing requirements for the second quarter are unusually low. Estimates range from $25 billion down to $10 billion. Although there is debate about the effect of the supply of government notes and bonds, it seems in the near term to help support market prices when it is lower. Bond prices move in inverse direction to their yields; a rise in a bond's selling price bond reduces the percentage it yields to the purchaser.
This week, it appears that many investors and traders may be preparing to focus more on the Treasury's limited borrowing in the second quarter than on the huge increase expected in the third quarter.
The one supply variable this week is the auction of the seven-year note. Some traders suggest that this auction, which has often led to market selloffs, could again go poorly and encourage selling, even given the limited Treasury borrowing needs now.
The other technical factor is speculation on what the Treasury will do about the mixture of its borrowing in an effort to reduce costs and help cut the Federal budget deficit.
The Treasury is in the midst of a study of how it would have to alter the maturity periods of its bonds, notes and bills to produce the $16.3 billion savings over five years called for in President Clinton's budget proposals, which were released in detail last week.
One way to achieve such savings, as noted in a Senate Budget Committee proposal and an analysis by Goldman Sachs & Company, would be to reduce the total size of the 30-year bond auction, eliminate the 7-year Treasury note, cut the size of the 5-year note auction 20 percent and shift this borrowing to short-term Treasury bills. The savings would be achieved by borrowing at lower interest rates, and the analysis assumes there will not be a big jump in short-term rates.
 
Matter of Degree
 The Treasury study is expected to determine whether such a change in the borrowing mixture might prove to be too radical. If it is deemed so, the change would be more modest and the $16.3 billion savings target might have to be scaled back.
Speculation that the more radical approach will be adopted by the Treasury was reported by Stone & McCarthy Research Associates and by Goldman Sachs last week. Just this talk helped push up the price of the 30-year bond by 30/32 over two days -- on Tuesday and Wednesday -- and pushed down the yield to 6.95 percent.
At a news conference on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said once again that he planned no radical changes. But the definition of radical has been left unclear.
Over the last five quarters, the Treasury has already reduced the 30-year auction to a total of $9.25 billion from $12 billion, a 23 percent cut that was apparently not deemed radical. It seems clear that if a further cut in the size of the 30-year auction is made, it will be done by moving from four regular auctions a year to two, rather than trimming back individual auctions. Market analysts and Treasury officials agree that reducing the size of the individual auctions any further leaves open the possibility that they would be small enough to be manipulated by large buyers.
So if a cut is made, eliminating the 30-year auction this May would be a logical choice if the Treasury thinks it is more important to achieve budget savings than to maintain a constant and predictable approach to borrowing in the Treasury market.

HEADLINE: House Panel To Examine Air Fare Suit

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
Responding to an unlikely alliance of airlines and consumer groups, Congress plans to investigate the merits of a pending antitrust case filed by the Justice Department.
The department has accused the eight largest United States airlines of using a computerized reservation system to fix air fares. Specifically, the airlines are accused of signaling proposed changes in their future fares, thereby alerting other airlines that then decide whether to match, underprice or ignore their rivals. 
 The Justice Department wants the airlines to make the fares available as soon as they are entered into the computer reservation system, and not at some future date, to preclude such potential collusion. In other words, if an airline signals that it plans to change a specific fare on a certain route, it must offer that fare immediately.
Without admitting or denying the Government's accusation, United and USAir have agreed to sign a consent decree and end the practice of communicating proposed fare increases through the computerized system. But American, Delta, Northwest, Continental, T.W.A. and Alaska Airlines are defending themselves in the courts.
The Justice Department's antitrust suit is not related to a class action on price fixing filed by consumer groups on behalf of airline passengers who traveled between Jan. 1, 1988, and June 30, 1992. In the settlement of that case, consumers are to receive discount coupons for future flights.
 
An Unusual Coalition
 In the Justice Department case, airlines and consumer groups find themselves on the same side.
Neil Monroe, a spokesman for Delta, said, "We think that the airline industry is being unreasonably targeted for giving out advance information that is readily available from every other industry, from car makers to retail stores."
Consumer groups also oppose the antitrust suit, arguing that advance information on fare changes helps the public in travel planning. For example, a travel agent might alert a client that a round-trip fare between New York and Miami was scheduled to increase in one week and that it would be advantageous to buy the ticket before the increase.
Responding to complaints from consumer groups, Representative James L. Oberstar, the Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the aviation subcommittee of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, has scheduled hearings on the matter for April 20.
"We want to find out just how this sharing of information through electronic transmission works," Mr. Oberstar said last week in an interview. "Is it a substitute for face-to-face agreements to raise prices, or is it simply a clearinghouse of information? Does it benefit consumers or disadvantage them?
"Many consumer groups say that this consent decree would adversely affect consumers by resulting in higher fares and less competition," he continued. "That's something that ought to be aired."
 
'An Interdependent Industry'
 Some industry officials acknowledge that the airlines have used the computerized reservation system to advise their competitors of future fares. "We're an interdependent industry," said Elliot Seiden, Northwest Airlines' vice president for governmental affairs, who formerly headed the Justice Department's transportation antitrust division.
"None of us can price without regard to the competitive response of our competitors," Mr. Seiden said.
From the consumer's standpoint, the product -- an airline seat on a given route -- is easily transferrable from one airline to another, Mr. Seiden noted, and therefore "if one airline has a fare increase, you lose bookings immediately," he said.
Mr. Seiden contends that price signaling is not illegal. "There's no violation in the Sherman Act called 'price signaling,' " he said, referring to the principal Federal antitrust statute. To be guilty of price fixing, Mr. Seiden said, "you need an agreement between the parties," who never meet under the existing system.
 
Frequent Fare Changes
 The Justice Department contends that price-fixing agreements are tacitly reached through the computer reservation system and that airlines collude by frequently making changes in future fares before the fares take effect.
The Justice Department claimed that in one case an airline made 11 changes in a future fare in a 30-day period, making it all but impossible for a consumer to make plans on the basis of this information because the actual ticket could not be purchased at the new fare until its effective date.
The lawsuit said that in some cases an airline would signal its intention to reduce a fare on a route that was lucrative for a competitor, which would then retaliate by signaling its intention to reduce a fare on a route that was lucrative for the first airline. In some cases, both fare reductions were then abandoned, or an accommodation was reached, the Justice Department contended in a brief filed last week.
"Consumers pay a substantial price for the airlines' communication tools -- higher fares than would otherwise prevail -- and receive little countervailing benefit from them," the department said. "Because ticket dates are used by the airlines to negotiate, not to notify consumers about fare changes, they are by their nature extremely unreliable and of minimal value to consumers."
 
Not a Typical Commodity
 Consumer groups see the issue differently. They argue that the signaled fare often takes effect as scheduled and is matched by competitors.
"The problem is the Justice Department suit doesn't give enough emphasis to the fact that consumers want flexibility when purchasing airline tickets," said Cornish Hitchcock, an aviation specialist with Public Citizen, the consumer advocates group founded by Ralph Nader.
"Unlike other commodities, airline tickets are purchased often well before consumers actually use them," he continued. "People are reluctant to commit their money if they don't have to, and want flexibility in arranging travel dates."
Mr. Hitchcock said the Justice Department had offered scant evidence to prove its case. Therefore, he said, "it's difficult to know if this is a good price-fixing case or merely economic theory that anti-competitive behavior has in fact occurred."
Similarly, Linda Golodner, president of the National Consumers League, said, "We feel that consumers should know up front what the costs are and what discounts are available."

HEADLINE: Back on Track in Aiding Nicaragua

 BODY:
Nicaragua's failure to please Senator Jesse Helms, the hard-right North Carolina Republican, will no longer cost it American support. The State Department says that $50 million in blocked U.S. aid will now be released because Nicaragua is making progress on human rights and other matters in dispute.
Senator Helms's oft-repeated complaint is that President Violeta Chamorro yielded too much power to the Sandinistas she defeated in 1990. Granted, Mrs. Chamorro opted for conciliation by retaining Humberto Ortega, brother of former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega, as head of the armed forces. 
 Yet it never troubled Mr. Helms that in Chile, an elected democratic government agreed pragmatically to permit the former rightist dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, to continue as military commander. Nor has he clamored for a purge of the Salvadoran armed forces and punishment of all their human rights crimes. The Senator's indignation is selective: his tolerance for hard-right thuggery is exceeded only by his enthusiasm for tobacco subsidies.
Nicaragua can be faulted for its failure to punish recent killings of former contras, and to move expeditiously on compensating owners of property lawlessly seized by the Sandinistas. Thus the Bush Administration last summer put $104 million in aid on hold. It then released $54 million of that aid in December, letting a new Administration decide about the balance. By any fair measure, that deferred more than enough to Mr. Helms.
Mrs. Chamorro merits praise for drastically reducing the size of the army and curbing runaway inflation. Her battered country is still recovering from a civil war that was fueled by the Reagan Administration's covert support for contra rebels. Having contributed to this mess, Washington has reason to assist in the cleanup.

HEADLINE: Empire Blue Cross Deserves Better Treatment;
Not the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to statements attributed to me in "The Blame for Empire's Mess" (editorial, March 31), I have never blamed the "poor economy" for Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield's problems. Nor have I, the Insurance Department or the Cuomo administration been inattentive to the real problems. The state's landmark community rating-open enrollment legislation, proposed by Governor Cuomo in 1991, was designed to address many of the concerns you implicitly raise. Moreover, an Arthur Andersen audit of Empire, encouraged by my office, will speak to the direct management concerns. 
 For years Empire accepted for coverage all domestic individuals and small groups, including those whose health histories made them unacceptable to the large commercial insurers. During this time, commercial insurers routinely skimmed off the best small-group risks for themselves, which meant larger rate increases for the pool of poor risks that remained with Empire. Most of these commercial insurers also refused to sell health insurance to individuals.
Empire's record of profits and losses for large corporate accounts in the last few years roughly parallels that of many of its commercial competitors. One big difference is that Empire rises or falls with its health insurance business, while large commercial companies can mask losses on the health side by profits generated by other lines of business.
Empire must also contend with the jump in Medical care costs, estimated at 12 percent last year and projected to increase further unless our system of health care delivery is significantly altered. And since Empire's individual and small group policyholders tend to be older and sicker than those of other carriers, the costs will rise even higher.
Finally, I have consistently said that Empire could have been managed better in the last five years. The Arthur Andersen audit, due out May 1, should determine if mismanagement played a role in the company's tailspin. In addition, a nine-member bipartisan panel has been authorized by legislation enacted this year to provide additional oversight.
Friends and critics of Empire may point to other reasons for Empire's problems, but none to my knowledge has ever cited the poor economy. To attribute such a simplistic and wrongheaded view to me, the public official charged with regulating the company, is inaccurate and irresponsible.

HEADLINE: Jefferson Is America -- And America Is Jefferson

BYLINE: By David K. Shipler; David K. Shipler, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, is writing a book about race in America.

DATELINE: Chevy Chase, Md.

 BODY:
Thomas Jefferson embodied the most powerful contradiction of the American legacy. His declarations on individual liberty, which remain a moral and political compass, showed the brilliance of a transcendent mind. But he also believed in the inferiority of black people, demonstrating how even a great thinker can remain captive of the racist stereotypes of his time.
That one man could simultaneously possess such vision and such blindness is intriguing; that his attitudes on race should persist in the culture at large, as they have, tells a troubling story about American society. It is a perspective that schools, universities and libraries should adopt as they celebrate the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth today, , for he can be just as instructive about the wounds of racism as the nobility of democracy. And his statements about blacks are rarely taught in history courses. 
 "We routinely return to Jefferson and his era in order to discover the glory of America," wrote Charles A. Miller, a Jefferson scholar at Lake Forest College in Illinois. "We should also be willing to return in order to find early evidence of our distress." Mr. Miller added: "I believe that Jefferson was firmly -- centrally and emblematically -- in the stream of American anguish over slavery and race, and he knew it. I also believe that the present, in altered form, is like Jefferson."
Recognizing this becomes especially important in an era when many whites seem convinced that racism has abated, that blacks have equal opportunity, that the slate was wiped clean by the civil rights laws of the 1960's. Whites who oppose antidiscrimination measures often argue sincerely that they are not responsible for a past that is long gone.What they don't acknowledge is that while slavery and legal segregation have ended, many attitudes that drove those practices remain, although muted and often concealed beneath the surface of propriety.
Racism is still the most corrosive problem in America, and its major elements can be seen clearly in what Jefferson wrote and did.
In his only book, "Notes on the State of Virginia," written in 1785, Jefferson observes his slaves and endorses virtually every stereotype -- positive but largely negative -- that today characterizes the system of prejudices about black people physically, mentally, sexually, emotionally.
Their "unfortunate difference of color" makes blacks less beautiful than whites, Jefferson writes. "Are not the fine mixtures of red and white, the expressions of every passion by greater or less suffusions of color in the one, preferable to that eternal monotony . . . that immovable veil of black which covers the emotions of the other race?"
He indulges in false science. "They secrete less by the kidneys, and more by the glands of the skin, which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odor," he argues, adding that this "renders them more tolerant of heat, and less so of cold than the whites."
"They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome," he continues. "But this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present. . . . They are more ardent after their female; but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient . . . In memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid."
Jefferson excuses blacks' supposed "disposition to theft," attributing it to "their situation, and not to any depravity of the moral sense." He adds: "We find among them numerous instances of the most rigid integrity, of benevolence, gratitude, and unshaken fidelity."
Jefferson proposes "to make great allowances for the difference of condition, of education, of conversation, of the sphere in which they move." On the other hand, he notes, many slaves worked closely with whites in the crafts, and others had the opportunity to converse with their masters.
"But never yet could I find that a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration; never saw even an elementary trait of painting or sculpture. In music they are more generally gifted than the whites," but not in other arts. "Misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry. Among the blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no poetry."
Jefferson concludes that "their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition of life," then later modifies himself slightly, saying that he puts forth this view "with great diffidence" and "as a suspicion only."
Such ugly suspicions, also tempered with diffidence, lie in mainstream white America today. They nag quietly at the platitudes and the fine principles and the professions of tolerance. As Jefferson demonstrated, they co-exist alongside an understanding of their damage to society.
Jefferson saw the harm done to the children of masters, who were "nursed, educated, and daily exercised in tyranny." He perceived the black-white divisions that were being created. "Deep-rooted prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, of the injuries they have sustained; new provocations; the real distinctions which nature has made; and many other circumstances, will divide us into parties, and produce convulsions, which will probably never end."
But he also tried to quell his conscience, much as we do now. Jefferson inherited 20 slaves from his father and 135 from his father-in-law, along with thousands of acres of land, and thereby found himself embedded in the slavery-dependent economy of 18th century Virginia. He eloquently deplored slavery but failed to abolish it, either as Governor or President or master of his estates. He freed only two slaves in his lifetime and five under his will.
He saw himself as benevolent, as indeed he was by the standards of the day. He usually spared the whip and was so devoted to keeping families together that he sometimes bought a slave rather than permit a couple to be separated.
In principle, if not in practice, Jefferson showed no ambivalence about slavery. It undermined the morals and the liberties of the nation; it stood against God's ultimate justice and the inevitable turn of history. In his draft of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson included a stirring paragraph condemning the King of England for having "waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's [cq] most sacred rights of life and liberty" by maintaining the "execrable commerce" in in which "MEN [cq] should be bought and sold." This emphasis on the word "men" leaves no doubt that Jefferson meant slaves as well when he wrote, "All men are created equal." The Continental Congress deleted the paragraph, which he noted when he sent out copies of the text.
He was not an integrationist, however, and he opposed racial mixing and intermarriage. His idea was to free the slaves, train them for self-sufficiency and then deport them, for he saw no possibility that blacks and whites could live together.
Jefferson was accused of fathering children by a mulatto slave, Sally Hemings. This he denied in private correspondence, and most Jefferson scholars believe him. But many black Americans, including the descendants of Hemings, accept it as undisputed fact, for it symbolizes the unequal relationships, the intricate realities of black oppression, sexual and otherwise.
These are the two histories of Jefferson, the two histories of America. If we face Jefferson, we face ourselves.

HEADLINE: Angolan Rebels Rebound, Within Reach of a Victory

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOBITO, Angola

 BODY:
Nearly six months after the elections that were supposed to cement the peace in Angola, the rebel leader who lost in the vote has resumed the civil war and scored such enormous advances that there is talk he might engineer an outright military victory.
The rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, seemed poised in September to pass into history after he lost his bid to be the country's first elected President to his longtime rival, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Within weeks, many leaders of the rebel group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, were either killed or captured by Government forces, and the group had lost the support of its main backers, the United States and South Africa. 
 After a major Government offensive, officials in Luanda, the capital, were predicting the imminent collapse of the movement, which is known by its Portuguese acronym Unita.
 
 
Rebels Hold More Land
 But in recent weeks, Unita has expanded its territory and is now believed to control nearly two-thirds of the country, more than double the land the rebels held before a peace accord was reached in May 1991.
With a deft combination of cunning, tenacity and ruthlessness, Mr. Savimbi and his forces have largely outmaneuvered the Government army. They have achieved their goals in part because they captured diamond and oil-producing regions that have provided the resources for their drive and also because they have capitalized on the caches of weapons and military units that were not dismantled after the 1991 accord.
"Unita has managed to accomplish in two months what they couldn't do in nearly two decades of fighting," said a Western diplomat here. "And given his recent successes on the battlefield, it would be unrealistic to think Savimbi's going to be satisfied until he has it all."
After his recent military successes, Mr. Savimbi has raised the ante for cease-fire talks, saying his soldiers will continue the struggle to "liberate" Angola until his terms are met, although he has yet to explain exactly what he wants.
[Talks on a cease-fire, aid deliveries, the division of power and the future role of the United Nations in Angola opened April 12 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The opening message sent by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the United Nations would decide whether to renew the mandate of the 700 peacekeepers in Angola based on the outcome of the talks.]
 
Plans to Hold On
 In a recent radio broadcast Mr. Savimbi said, "We have now captured many, many tanks here in Huambo. We have antiaircraft guns, long-range guns and we have ammunition. We can, therefore, continue this war for a long time."
But while military prowess has contributed to Unita's recent advances, cheating and subterfuge probably played an even greater role, American officials said.
The accord called for demobilizing troops and forming a new army together. But Western officials said that, while the Government obeyed, Unita is estimated to have kept a force of 30,000 to 35,000 soldiers. The Government had roughly three times that number before the cease-fire and by some estimates has reduced its forces to no more than 10,000.
"The Government largely played by the rules, and lost big time," said a Western military analyst. "You can be assured they won't make that mistake again, and that makes resolving the civil war that much harder."
Indeed, President dos Santos has acknowledged that his forces were unprepared for the Unita offensive in the fall. But in recent weeks, Parliament passed a law reintroducing compulsory military service, and Government soldiers who had been demobilized have been drafted again.
By any standard, Angola is in desperate shape, torn by deep political divisions, devastated by years of war that have killed between 350,000 and 500,000 people, maimed tens of thousands and created an estimated 2 million refugees in a population of 10 million. The oil industry, which forms the basis of the economy and accounts for 95 percent of export earnings, continues to function, but the recent rebel gains are posing a threat.
If anything, the new round of fighting seems even more brutal than the first stage, which began in 1975 after Angola obtained independence from Portugal, its colonial ruler. Unita and the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, which fought together against the Portuguese, turned on each other and became cold war proxies. As the United States and South Africa supported Unita, the Soviet Union and Cuba backed the Popular Movement, which won control of the country.
 
15,000 Civilians Died
 Earlier this year, Unita soldiers appeared to have systematically targeted residents of Huambo, Mr. Savimbi's stronghold, during the eight-week battle for control of Angola's second-largest city, said dozens of refugees here and in the nearby town of Benguela.
The battle for control of Huambo -- in which 15,000 civilians died, by United Nations estimate -- effectively ended March 6 in a victory for Unita. But hundreds of residents have continued to make the perilous journey here in search of food and medicine.
"Huambo has a population of about 400,000, and we simply do not know how or if they are surviving," said Philippe Borel, the director of operations in Luanda for the World Food Program, a United Nations agency.
 
One Man's Journey
 It took Agostinho Buli 14 grueling days to make the 250-mile trek from Huambo in Angola's central highlands to this Atlantic Ocean port. But the 18-year-old student lost his mother, four brothers and two sisters on the journey.
Four of Mr. Buli's relatives died while trying to cross the Catumbela River. A rope was strung so people could pull themselves across, he said. But when rebel soldiers tossed hand grenades into the river, many people, including his mother, lost their grip and drowned. The remaining family members died in a similar attack at the Cubal River. They are some of the latest victims of a civil war that most people thought was over.
Many Angolans appear to feel no assurance that the formerly Marxist Government offers a better alternative. Government troops, especially in and around Luanda, are increasingly guilty of their own forms of terrorism, diplomats said.
African and Western diplomats say the capital became a virtual hunting ground as soldiers and militia leaders, armed with machetes, pistols and AK-47 rifles searched for Unita partisans. Reports indicate that the toll was heavy, with many hundreds and perhaps thousands slain.
During the long years of violence and relentless enmity, reports of torture and atrocities by Mr. Savimbi's forces against his own followers were not given much credence outside a small circle of his longtime critics. Now, as Unita's treatment of unarmed civilians fleeing provincial battlefields has come to light, the earlier reports are being given more weight. In interviews, many refugees said they took their chances and knowingly walked through areas strewn with land mines rather than face almost certain death at the hands of Unita soldiers.
"When the Cubans and South Africans were here, the war was soldier against soldier," said an American official based in Angola. "But it's no longer a fight just among soldiers. Unita is now targeting anyone that might be seen as a Government sympathizer, and that of course includes civilians." For its part, Unita says the Government has targeted Unita supporters, including civilians.
Mercedes Sayagues, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program, said that abuses of civilians are mounting. "In this new phase of war, civilians have become deeply involved, and their suffering has greatly increased," she said.
Whether Unita has indeed deliberately targeted civilians is unclear. Some analysts suggest that those killed while fleeing Huambo were victims of undisciplined or possibly renegade Unita units. A ban on travel to the area made it impossible to confirm the numbers.
But there is no doubt that Unita's recent string of military victories over Government forces -- it is said to control much of the provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul and the important cities of Cuito and Luena -- has come at a heavy cost to the population. Near Malange, for example, a city of nearly 400,000 people 200 miles southeast of Luanda, Unita has taken control of much of the surrounding countryside, severing road traffic and Government supply lines.
If the roads remain blocked, Malange's food supply will soon be reduced to whatever can be brought in by air.
"Unita has put a stranglehold on the town; we're completely cut off and at Unita's mercy," said Jorge Modesto, a Brazilian who manages the World Food Program there.
 
Diamonds Pay for War
 Ultimately, Unita's control of the countryside will depend to a large degree on its ability to provide its force with food, weapons and ammunition. For now, diplomats, relief workers and missionaries say, Unita's main source of revenue is Angola's diamond-rich Lunda Norte province, with the diamonds being sold across the border in Zaire.
Here in Lobito, the toll of the renewed fighting is etched in the haggard faces and battered bodies of people arriving from Huambo. Despite the trauma of the journey, many gave relatively lucid and detailed accounts of their ordeal. One measure of their credibility is that most described themselves as Unita supporters. Huambo is regarded as the cultural heartland of the Ovimbundu, the ethnic group to which Mr. Savimbi belongs, and a region that voted overwhelmingly for Unita in the elections.
 
Hid from the Rebels
 Several refugees said that they had tried to live in hiding in the dry savannah, but were constantly chased by Unita units, who were also pursuing fleeing Government soldiers.
"We had nothing to eat, and the only way we could get water was from the river," said Violeta Bimbi, 23 years old, who fled with six children from Huambo and arrived here after a 14-day journey.
Nito Caetano, a 34-year-old man in ragged clothing, said Unita soldiers had attacked and killed his brother with machetes after they accused him of being a Government collaborator.
"We were about 150 kilometers from Huambo," Mr. Caetano said, "but the soldiers were still chasing us." Asked why the rebels would go to such lengths to pursue him, he said that his father had been a senior official in the provincial government, and that several family members, including his brother, also held government jobs.
In a transcript from a radio account, a relief worker in Huambo told officials back in Luanda: "People ate grass to survive. Many women who had small children who could not walk alone were obliged to abandon them in the bush because the load was too heavy.
"When they were crossing the river Catumbela many people drowned because Unita was chasing them and they had to choose between jumping into the river or being caught by Unita. Those who could not swim, drowned. More than 200 people are estimated to have died in this manner."
At a makeshift refugee camp in Lobito, Agostinho Buli sat stiffly in a chair as he tried to describe the turmoil he has felt since seeing his family drown. He said that the "pain will never heal" because his mother did not have a proper burial.
"When I saw my mother drown, I tried to kill myself,' he said. "I wanted to jump in too, and join her, but I was prevented from doing so," he said.
"I still want to kill myself. What's the use of living?"

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Senate G.O.P. Tastes Success, but It Probably Won't Be a Diet

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
So the Senate's 43 Republicans have logged a Cinderella-rank upset, knocking off both the White House's $19.5 billion jobs bill and its reputation for political savvy last week with a single filibuster. Politics is a blood sport, and a party is only as good as its next victory.
The question then is this: Where can the Republicans strike next? 
 Not President Clinton's tax proposals. The taxes, as well as all spending for mandatory programs like Medicare, will move to a vote under Senate rules that forbid such delaying tactics.
Not the rest of the budget. Filibusters against major spending bills are almost unheard of; few Republicans would cut off money to an entire Cabinet department, chockablock with popular programs, just to protest the spending they don't like.
And not Hillary Rodham Clinton's health-care package in all likelihood. Many in both parties say the problem of medical costs is so urgent -- and the public's demand for a solution so angry and strong -- that they want to handle it in as bipartisan a fashion as possible.
 
Hazards of Success
 For Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, this neatly illustrates the big drawback of being a giant-killer: it raises expectations.
From freshmen senators to George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, to the President, Democrats have tried to cast Mr. Dole and his band of filibusterers as threats to Mr. Clinton's entire political agenda, if not the economy and the Republic itself.
"It seems clear that there is a determined effort to defeat the President's program," Mr. Mitchell said last week at the height of the jobs-bill debate. "Prudence dictates that we anticipate this reaction to any legislation proposed by the President."
Reality suggests otherwise. Across the landscape of Mr. Clinton's legislative agenda, only a few proposals stand out as likely targets for Republican filibusters. And most of those are not atop the White House's list of priorities.
"Campaign finance, maybe," one senior Administration official suggested last week, referring to Mr. Clinton's fervent but amorphous commitment to rewrite the rules of raising and spending political money.
Any bill to grant statehood to the lopsidedly Democratic District of Columbia would certainly be filibustered. So might a Democratic proposal that would bar companies from the union-busting practice of hiring permanent replacements for striking workers.
While some other bills are certain to be stalled at least briefly by talkathons -- in Congress's last two-year session, there were 48 attempts to break filibusters -- few of the filibusters are likely to last long or have much success. Their recent victory aside, Republicans in Congress are far weaker this year than at any other time in the last 12.
Arithmetic shows why. When George Bush was President, the Democratic-controlled Senate needed to muster two-thirds of the body's 100 lawmakers -- 67 votes -- to override his frequent vetoes. With Bill Clinton in power, and vetoes of Democratic legislation unlikely at best, the magic number drops to three-fifths of the Senate, or 60 votes, the number Democrats must summon to cut off debate on a bill and force a final vote.
At a result, Republicans must hold on to 41 of their 43 members, in most debates, or lose control of the floor and the legislation. Being a fractious group of politicians these days, that is not easy.
 
One of the Wavering
 "We had all gotten used to having a President who backs us with vetoes," said Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, "so you could do things with 33 or 34 votes. Now you have a situation where you need 40 votes, and it has to get pretty tight before we have any purpose" as a serious political opponent.
Mr. Jeffords knows the arithmetic well. A Republican liberal, and therefore a member of a vanishing species, he is regularly courted by Democrats to desert his party on close votes.
He remained loyal during the jobs-bill filibuster. But "if it gets down to the point of quibbling over a few dollars," Mr. Jeffords said, "don't count on me to be for a filibuster. I'm not going to hold up the President" over small change.
For Mr. Dole, the man charged with keeping filibusters going, susceptible lawmakers like Mr. Jeffords are but part of the problem. At the other end of the party's spectrum are advocates of ideological war with the Democrats, like Phil Gramm of Texas and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, who pull the entire party rightward and make it difficult to retain 41 votes on any issue.
The result is that Republicans are able to stop only two kinds of Democratic initiatives: Those they are not so passionate about and thus do not really disagree over, and those they care about so deeply that any internal differences can be papered over for the sake of the cause.
Last month, Senate Republicans filibustered a bill in the first category, the proposal to increase voter registration by allowing it when renewing a driver's license, for example. And they forced Democrats to make significant changes in the measure to pass it.
Mr. Clinton's jobs bill -- a title that the Republicans assert is false advertising -- is of the care-deeply variety, and Republicans have so adamantly refused to swallow it that it now seems possible that it will not pass at all.
Senator Gramm said most observers misunderstood the reason for the latest filibuster. "People are focused on the wrong end of the spectrum," he said. "They're focused on what this means about the relative power of the President as opposed to the Republicans in Congress, or what this means about the political power struggle. We're very united on this because we're on the issue that defines the Republican party: tax and spend."
The bill allots $19.5 billion for a grab-bag of public-works projects, social welfare programs and budget increases for Federal agencies, all with the stated purpose of creating jobs and stoking the economy's fires. Republicans contend that only about $4 billion in payments to the unemployed is really needed right now, and they are insistent that the Federal deficit should not be increased to pay for the rest.
But Senator Jeffords says there is less to this than meets the eye. The collision over the legislation is less a test of political strength, he says, than a learning experience for Republicans and Democrats who have not worked in a one-party Government since the days of Jimmy Carter. Had the White House stroked the opposition a bit more and offered to spend a little less, he suggests, the filibuster might never have occurred.
Which is another reason the Republicans may not enjoy such success again soon, a senior Administration aide contended. "From now on," he said, "let's just say the White House probably will be more sensitive to internal Republican politics."

HEADLINE: Japan Leader Takes Hard Line on Trade

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 12

 BODY:
Despite growing pressure from the Clinton Administration on trade issues, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa today rejected the idea of establishing new specific targets for Japanese imports of American goods and cautioned that trade tensions could not be solved quickly.
In a wide-ranging interview with American correspondents today, Mr. Miyazawa said that in his first meeting with President Clinton this week, he would offer what Japanese describe as a step that could improve the trade imbalance, a plan to stimulate the Japanese economy with more than $100 billion in new Government spending. 
 But the Prime Minister offered virtually no new ideas or plans to ease economic tensions between the two countries, saying he planned to remind Mr. Clinton that Japan and the United States had been struggling for a decade to close the trade gap, and "there is no reason why we should solve it overnight."
 
Spur to Japan's Economy
 The idea of new Government spending is that it would stimulate the Japanese economy and lead to more imports. But Japan has declined to set aside a specific portion of that money for the purchase of imported goods.
In fact, Mr. Miyazawa today all but rejected making any agreements that would set a target share of the Japanese market for American products, a technique many in the Administration favor after the relative success of that approach in greatly increasing the sales of American computer chips here.
"We must never agree on managed trade," the Prime Minister said. "We really cannot tell private industries to purchase something from this country or that country."
His comments, a day before foreign ministers and finance ministers from the world's richest nations arrive here to come up with a package of aid for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, and three days before Mr. Miyazawa's trip to Washington, came at a critical moment for the quiet-spoken internationalist who was supposed to groom Japan for a new age of influence.
While Mr. Miyazawa renewed his pledge to help Mr. Yeltsin, he said he could not offer any assurance that the amount of aid offered by Japan would rank second only to that provided by the United States. That is where many American officials say it should be, given the size of Japan's economy. "I think we are probably doing the best of Japan's ability," he said.
 
Criticized at Home and Abroad
 Yet at home and abroad Mr. Miyazawa finds himself constantly criticized these days for lacking vision and gumption. Ducking to avoid criticism from France and Germany about Japan's reluctance to prove large-scale aid to Russia before a territorial dispute is settled, hoping President Clinton's recent tough language about Japan's economic practices will somehow evaporate before they meet on Friday, and unwilling to criticize his political colleagues caught up in the center of an enormous influence-peddling scandal, Mr. Miyazawa sometimes seems like a man more comfortable as the savvy Finance Ministry bureaucrat he once was than the leader of the world's second-largest economy.
Today he cautioned that "I can't promise anything that I can't deliver on," a seeming acknowledgment of his domestic political weakness. But he is known for a deep commitment, inherited from mentors who served as Japan's first postwar leaders, to improving relations with the United States.
He readily laughed off Mr. Clinton's recent comments, leaked from the Vancouver summit meeting with Mr. Yeltsin, that the Japanese often say yes when they mean no.
"I think this yes or no thing is something I myself might say," he mused, speaking in English. "You all remember, don't you, 'Yes, We Have No Bananas?' That reminded me of that particular song." He added, "The more I think about it, the more that is the way we converse, we Japanese."
Mr. Miyazawa's aides insist he will not go to Washington totally empty-handed: he will propose a program to share technology on magnetically levitated trains and subways, and offer to send more Japanese language teachers to the United States to train future business people to deal with Japan.
 
Hard Line on Trade
 But a senior Foreign Ministry official, taking a hard line during a briefing for reporters about the trip earlier today, made it clear that the Japanese Government would take the view that most of the problem was in the United States. "The idea that a closed Japanese market is linked to our trade surplus, this is the thought we have to contest," the official said.
The official contended that American companies were still looking to "shift the responsibility for the failure of American exporters" on Japanese firms and regulations, rather than on themselves. "Many Japanese Government and business leaders view much of the grumbling in America as excuses," he said.
Some Japanese say Mr. Miyazawa's personality explains the lack of action. "He has an extremely subtle mind," one of his close advisers said the other day. "He is just a very passive personality. He reacts to things. He grew up in an age when Japan did what it was told, and he doesn't think in terms of breaking new ground."
Indeed, pressed for concrete ideas he will be taking to Washington, Mr. Miyazawa talked only of "closer consultation between our two Governments."
In recent times the approval ratings for Mr. Miyazawa's Cabinet have dropped to around 20 percent, in the past often a signal that ouster from office was in the offing. But Mr. Miyazawa's rivals have almost all been neutralized, and he seems likely to stay for some time.
Today Mr. Miyazawa was careful not to give away much about what Japan is willing to contribute to the Russian aid package when the foreign and finance ministers of the Group of Seven major industrial countries -- including Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- arrive here on Tuesday night. But he strongly suggested that despite pressure from aborad, Japan's enthusiasm for the program would have its limits.
 
Territorial Dispute With Russia
 Referring to the dispute over the group of islands that the Soviet Union seized from Japan in the waning days of World War II, the Prime Minister said: "It may be difficult for the Russian Federation to solve the territorial issue immediately, as they are in turmoil.
"At the same time, for Japanese to send them a great amount of aid -- a large amount of aid -- then the people would be more amenable if this issue between our two countries had been solved."
The two goals of propping up Mr. Yeltsin and retaining leverage in the islands issue "are not imcompatible," he said.
Asked if Japan could tolerate a nuclear-armed North Korea, Mr. Miyazawa offered the most definitive answer of the afternoon, saying simply, "No."
But when he was pressed on the question of what Japan was prepared to do in the wake of North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he said that his country "would rather give them some time to reconsider" before imposing economic sanctions.

U.S. Urges Japanese Stimulus
 WASHINGTON, April 12 (Special to The New York Times) -- Seeking to press Japan just days before its Prime Minister visits Washington, Administration officials are urging Tokyo to spend more money to stimulate its economy in an effort to lift the world economy and reduce Japan's mammoth trade surplus.
"The United States and many other countries need export-led growth," a senior Administration official said in an interview late Sunday. This, he said, can come only if Japan reduces its trade surplus, which soared to a record $120 billion last year.
The Administration official, who insisted on anonymity, suggested that Tokyo's economic stimulus package for last year, which Japanese officials said totaled $80 billion, amounted to less than that. As a result, the official suggested, Japan's economy remains mired in its worst slump in two decades.
Many American economists agree. For instance, they say, using Japan's social security trust fund to buy municipal bonds rather than Government bonds should not be counted as an economic stimulus.

HEADLINE: Health Planners' Radical Idea: Same Coverage for All

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
At the core of President Clinton's health-care plan is a radical new concept: a standard package of health benefits that would be guaranteed to all Americans and perhaps be more generous than the health insurance most have now.
The idea of a uniform benefit package appears to have immense appeal. It could improve health care for many people,, including the 37 million who now have no health insurance, and it could help reduce administrative costs by standardizing policies. 
 But this idea, which sounds so simple, could prove politically explosive.
By defining the minimum benefits, the Federal Government would make decisions that are now left to state laws or to negotiations among insurers, employers and employees.
Congress will almost surely want to play a large role in determining what benefits are offered, raising the possibility of debate so intense that it could disrupt the entire effort to overhaul the nation's health-care system.
For example, some women's groups are demanding coverage of reproductive health services, including abortion. Dozens of other interest groups are lining up to make sure that their special concerns are well treated, too. The political horse-trading could drive costs to intolerable heights.
Elderly people are insisting on coverage of long-term care. Psychiatrists, marriage counselors, dentists, chiropractors, surgeons and other specialists are pleading for coverage of their services.
 
Undeterred By Pressures
 At the state level, where such debates now occur, similar pressures have led to a proliferation of insurance laws requiring coverage of particular services. Insurers say those mandates have pushed up costs.
Despite these concerns, Clinton Administration officials are contemplating a package of benefits more comprehensive that what is now available through Medicare or most private health insurance plans.
Confidential work papers from the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform show that the panel is drafting detailed requirements for coverage of items like vaccines, routine preventive care for babies, Pap smears, mammograms, physical examinations, prescription drugs, mental health services and drug-abuse treatment.
The contents of the benefit package will directly affect not only the costs, but also the plan's political acceptability. Benefits must be generous enough to attract broad support, to protect public health and to eliminate the temptation for people to buy private insurance to supplement the standard coverage. But if the package is too comprehensive, it will probably be too costly for the Government and for many employers.
"The problem is trying to determine what is superfluous, not what is necessary," said Representative Fred Grandy, an Iowa Republican who is a member of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. At a recent subcommittee hearing, Mr. Grandy repeatedly asked, "What should not be in the core benefits package?" He rarely got an answer.
 
Standard Benefits Are a Central Idea
 The idea of a standard benefit package is central to the health policy favored by Mr. Clinton. Under that policy, known as managed competition, large groups of consumers and businesses would buy the standard package of benefits from health maintenance organizations and other networks of doctors and hospitals. The networks are supposed to compete by offering high-quality care at low prices.
Presumably, most of the networks would be H.M.O.'s and similar prepaid group plans. But Administration officials say there would be provisions allowing people to obtain their health care on a "fee for service" basis as most people do now.
At present, it is difficult for consumers to shop for health insurance. "When each health plan is allowed to vary its benefits, consumers cannot easily make price comparisons," said Linda A. Bergthold, an expert on employee benefits, now working for the task force. Ms. Bergthold, an executive at the consulting firm William M. Mercer Inc., analyzed "benefit design choices" in a recent issue of the journal Health Affairs.
The Government could encourage reliance on the standard benefits through tax law. While employers can now take tax deductions for the cost of providing employee health benefits, some versions of managed competition call for limiting such deductions to the value of the standard package of benefits.
People would be free to buy more coverage with their own money, but Administration officials say they hope the package will be so attractive that most people accept it as adequate.
In the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton suggested that a new agency, the National Health Board, would design the benefit package. But members of Congress said they would never leave such an important decision to an administrative agency.
White House officials got the message. They now say the benefits must be specified in law by Congress. "It would be difficult to ask the American people to accept a pig in a poke," said Ira C. Magaziner, coordinator of the task force.
 
How a Plan Might Work
 Under the plan now being developed, patients would have to pay a certain amount for each medical service, depending on who provided it. The charges would be lower for people enrolled in health maintenance organizations. For example, a person in an H.M.O. might have to pay $10 for a visit to a doctor's office, while other patients would have to pay as much as 40 percent of the doctor's charges.
Mr. Magaziner said President Clinton's plan would propose "a comprehensive package of benefits toward the top end of the range" of the plans that are now available. Another official said, "It will be at the 80th or 90th percentile of generosity," meaning that it will be more generous than all but 10 percent or 20 percent of the policies now sold.
But that vision of an ideal health plan may collide with fiscal reality. While the Administration has made great progress in defining the benefits that ought to be guaranteed to all Americans, it has only begun to compute the cost.
Frank B. McArdle, manager of the Washington research office of Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits consulting firm, notes that controlling health costs is supposed to be a major goal of Mr. Clinton's plan. "Whom does it help if you require employers to provide a package of benefits so generous that people are laid off as a result?" Mr. McArdle asks.
Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said: "There are a lot of good benefits that people would like, but they increase the cost -- mental health services, prescription drugs, long-term care, home health care. There should be options. Small employers just won't be able to afford what big employers have been providing for a long time."
But the Administration says the standard benefit package must be comprehensive, or else millions of people will buy private insurance to supplement the basic coverage, and the inequities of the current health-care system will continue.
Moreover, Administration officials say if the standard coverage is comprehensive, the Government will be better able to control the costs of services. The Government will have far less control over services that people buy with their own money.
 
Benefits Now: A Dizzying Array
 A standard package of benefits would be a major change. American employers now provide health benefits to 140 million people, but "there is no standard health benefit package," said Mr. McArdle of Hewitt Associates. "Employees get a lot of choice among plans and among health-care providers," he said. "They value and appreciate that choice."
The average medium-sized to large employer offers workers a choice of at least one conventional insurance plan and one health maintenance organization, which provides a wide range of services in return for a fixed monthly payment. Data compiled by Hewitt Associates show that when given such a choice, 25 percent of employees typically join the H.M.O.
Benefit levels vary from industry to industry. If the Government defines a standard package, "it may not increase costs much for industries like aerospace and utilities, which already provide comprehensive benefits," Mr. McArdle said. But such a requirement could sharply increase costs for retail stores and other industries that now provide limited benefits, he said.
Likewise, Mr. McArdle said, "the same Federal mandate could be an insignificant new cost in the Northeast, where there is relatively generous coverage, but a large economic shock in Texas and the Southwest, where certain benefits like mental health are more limited."
 
Likely Components Of Basic Package
 The plan now envisioned by Administration officials would probably require employers and insurers to cover hospital services without limits on the number of days in the hospital or visits to hospital clinics.
White House officials say the standard benefits will include coverage for services provided by community health centers and other clinics serving low-income people.
It will also include coverage of preventive services like immunizations, prenatal care, mammograms, Pap smears and routine physical examinations, provided they are performed at regular intervals specified by the Government.
The Administration is considering requirements for coverage of mental health care, occupational therapy and physical therapy, but has not decided how to limit the scope or cost of these services.
Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, has repeatedly said that mental illness must be covered on the same basis as physical illness. Private insurance policies often restrict coverage of mental health care by setting limits on the number of days of hospitalization, the number of therapy sessions or the total cost. Many Administration officials want to abolish such limits and are seeking other ways to control costs.
The Administration wants to include hearing, vision and dental services for children, but has not decided how far to go in covering such care for adults.
In the campaign, Mr. Clinton said he would expand coverage of long-term care for elderly and disabled people. The standard benefits will probably include some long-term care, emphasizing services provided outside nursing homes. But long-term care is expensive, and the new benefits may be introduced gradually over 10 or 20 years, Administration officials say.
The basic benefit package will almost certainly include treatment for drug abuse. Hillary Rodham Clinton, head of the task force developing the President's plan, has said that treatment for mental illness and drug abuse must be included because they are "a problem that permeates the whole system." Dr. Steven A. Schroeder, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, says, "Substance abuse -- cigarettes, alcohol and drug abuse -- is the nation's No. 1 health problem."

HEADLINE: Japan Details Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, April 13

 BODY:
The Liberal Democratic Party released details of a $117 billion economic stimulus plan today.
In a summary, the ruling party cited the recent rise in the yen, the sluggish Japanese and United States economies and Japan's growing trade surplus as reasons for the plan. The package empashizes what the party called the "three E's": education, electronics and ecology. 
 The 13.2 trillion yen plan is Japan's largest ever, exceeding a 10.7 trillion yen package announced in August. It is to be approved at a special Cabinet meeting later today.
The package includes 1.2 trillion yen for local Government purchases of land for public projects. The Government will build an additional 50,000 public rental housing units. The package will also expand lending for the purchase and building of homes at reduced rates.

HEADLINE: Banks Seek Big Victory On Accounting Today

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A vote today by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on whether to force financial institutions to report changes in the market value of some of the securities they hold could produce a major victory for bank lobbyists.
Four of the seven board members have indicated support for the proposal, which is being fought by the banks. But a simple majority is not sufficient to take action. 
 Under a policy adopted two years ago, five votes -- a "super-majority" -- are required. If none of the three other members decides to also vote for the proposal, it would be the first time that a major accounting issue was blocked under this requirement.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board is a private-industry body to which the Securities and Exchange Commission has delegated responsibility for financial statements. The standards board determines accounting rules in the United States.
Dennis Beresford, the board's chairman and a supporter of the proposed accounting change, said in an interview that he had not rounded up a fifth vote and was concerned that one might not be found. Banks and other financial institutions have argued that no change should be made.
Financial institutions say they should have considerable flexibility to decide whether the securities they hold -- like bonds -- are to be classified as for trading or for investment. While bonds held for trading purposes are required to be valued at their market price under the existing rules, those held as investments are carried on the books at their purchase price, regardless of whether they have risen or fallen in value.
 
S.E.C. Has Sought Change
 The Securities and Exchange Commission, under the leadership of Richard C. Breeden, who will soon leave as chairman, has pushed for market-value accounting of financial assets, arguing that it would present a clearer picture of financial institutions' strength to investors. That has been opposed by some regulators, who fear that banks would be damaged in situations where interest rates rise, causing bond prices to fall and forcing the banks to report losses.
The proposal to be voted on today is basically the one put forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in September. Under board rules, further ballots would be required if it is approved today, but a defeat might end the project.
It calls for debt securities -- but not bank loans -- to be stated at market value unless the institution could prove, to its auditor's satisfaction, that it had both the intention and the ability to hold a particular security until it matured.
Under current rules, banks and other financial institutions effectively have the ability to decide how to account for a security. They can classify securities as investments, meaning they need not report losses if the market price declines. If the price rises, they can turn around and sell them, thus reporting the profit.
The issue has been before the accounting standards board for many years, and been subject to strong lobbying. As an interim step, the board required financial institutions to begin disclosing the market value of securities in footnotes to annual reports. That begins this year for institutions with at least $150 million in assets, and two years from now for smaller institutions.
 
Protests, and Change
 Many companies have been annoyed by accounting rules issued by the standards board. The Financial Accounting Foundation, which appoints the board's members, decided two years ago that new rules could be adopted only by a vote of at least five members, instead of four as had been the case. Banks were among those who lobbied for that change, and if today's vote produces a standoff, they will be the first beneficiaries.
In the intervening two years, the board has issued important statements, including new accounting rules for income taxes and for the cost of retirement health benefits. But the scope of the proposal on financial instruments was scaled back, in large part because it was clear that five votes could not be found.
All three members who expressed reservations about the proposal have indicated that they would like to go further in some way, and it is possible that at least one of them will decide to vote for the current plan rather than see nothing accomplished.
"The proposal is closer to my view than where we are in practice today," Robert Swieringa, a board member who hoped that the board would go much further, said yesterday. He declined to say if he would vote for the proposal.

HEADLINE: Clinton Adopts Tougher Tactics In Pushing His Stalled Jobs Plan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
President Clinton used the annual White House Easter Egg Roll today to step up his campaign against Republicans who are blocking his $19.5 billion jobs bill. Pointing to the thousands of children rolling eggs on the South Lawn, Mr. Clinton said they would benefit from the child immunization funds in his legislation but instead are the "hostages" of a Republican filibuster.
White House officials said the President's remarks, his harshest yet in the debate over the jobs plan, were the opening salvo of an intensified drive to salvage as much as possible of the package, which has been frozen in the Senate by a Republican filibuster. 
 Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after signing a proclamation encouraging child immunizations, Mr. Clinton suddenly turned, looked out his window and remarked: "I just want to say that today we're having the Easter Egg Roll on the White House lawn. You can look out there at those kids. They are the hostages of the Senate filibuster on the stimulus program."
Thumping his big Oval Office desk for emphasis, Mr. Clinton said Republican complaints that his jobs bill was larded with wasteful, pork barrel spending was "hot air rhetoric."
 
Diverted by Other Issues
 Having concluded that a series of foreign policy issues, health care debates and general overconfidence had combined to divert the President from his focus on selling the bill, Mr. Clinton has decided to use virtually every public event possible to drum up support for his package. The strategy: go for the Republicans' throats in public while offering them legislative compromises in private in hopes of striking a deal.
"They've just got to decide, as I said, how many people they want to keep out of work and how many people we want to put to work, and I think we can work something out," Mr. Clinton said. "I'm hopeful that we can."
Most of the $19.5 billion package goes for spending on new highways and bridges and summer jobs for teen-agers. Some $4 billion of it goes for extending unemployment benefits, and a fraction -- $300 million -- is for immunizing pre-school children.
Mr. Clinton's use of egg-rolling children as ammunition seemed to be a sign of White House nervousness that it may be losing the public debate over the proposal. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, responded with a salvo of faxes and puns. He said the President was getting "egg on his face" in resorting to emotional tactics, and was only trying to "hatch" a new excuse for getting the American people to support his jobs bill.
Mr. Clinton's ferocious defense of his package to stimulate the economy has focused national attention on the skirmish over what is a modest jobs bill that few economists think will have much impact, making a defeat potentially more embarrassing. Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton's much more important $1.52 trillion budget package has been sailing through Congress.
The President said today of the Senate Republicans: "These people, most of them, have been here the last 12 years while we have run immunization into the ground, while we've developed the third-worst rate in the hemisphere. And they've always got some excuse, some of them, for not doing anything. Now, what are we going to do about those children? That ought to be the question of the week. When I go out there on the lawn, and I think about those kids picking up Easter eggs, I want to be able to think about them all being immunized, and all those children coming along behind them being immunized."
Senator Dole faxed to Washington news bureaus a statement in response to Mr. Clinton's remarks.
"It looks like the President has egg on his face," said Mr. Dole, "considering the fact that the childhood immunization program still has more than $137 million in unspent funds."
Warming to the debate, Senator Dole added: "It's a shame President Clinton has resorted to using the children at the Easter egg hunt as a partisan political backdrop to hatch a new excuse for his so-called stimulus package. What President Clinton should tell those children is that he wants to saddle them with bigger deficits instead of paying for this new immunization spending and hundreds of other spending and taxing plans, which will rob them of their full potential."
Administration officials say they are open to changes in the jobs package and are discussing some ideas during the Senate recess with the Republicans. The issue, say White House officials, is how much the President will have to concede on the spending side of the bill to line up enough Republicans for a deal, and how much the President will have to concede on the tax side of the bill to hold Democrats. Many Democrats do not like the investment tax credits in the package, which are intended to encourage businesses to buy new machinery; the credits could cost the Treasury $21 billion over five years in lost revenue.

HEADLINE: With Fishes, Sake and Silk, Japan's Prince Plights His Troth

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 12

 BODY:
Helicopters hovered overhead, beaming to television viewers the path of her car through the morning traffic, and newspapers carried front-page articles with sketches showing where everyone sat for the ceremony as an American-educated commoner came one step closer to Japan's version of the ultimate fairy tale.
Masako Owada accepted two red fish, six bottles of sake and five bolts of silk today to signify her formal engagement to Crown Prince Naruhito, 33. June 9 was set as the wedding date. 
 Japan's economy may be bumping along the bottom of a recession, scandals are dogging the ruling party and the Government is bracing for serious trade problems with the United States, but the buzz in Tokyo today was pomp and ceremony of a magnitude the Japanese get to witness just a few times a century. They loved every bit of it.
No detail of the ancient rites celebrated today went unremarked in the tsunami of coverage of what was a relatively simple ceremony. As just about every commentator noted, it lasted from 9:00 A.M. to 9:03 A.M. But what a three minutes.
 
Imperial Van Delivers Gifts
 First there was the imperial van, which arrived at the home of Ms. Owada, a 29-year-old former diplomat, early this morning. It carried the plainly wrapped gifts, all determined by tradition. They were presented, along with the formal request of marriage, by Hiroo Kanno, grand master of the Crown Prince's Household.
The engagement was made official in January, but today's ceremony was a reminder that the marriage of an emperor-to-be is richly embroidered with threads of tradition and wealth, making them remarkably popular events.
There were two enormous tai, or red sea bream, an extremely expensive fish similar to a Florida red snapper. The fish, which weighed about 15 pounds each, cost some 100,000 yen, the equivalent of $885.
They were laid out head to head, at a slight angle to each other, forming the lucky symbol of the number eight, which is supposed to bring increasing prosperity to the couple, who will someday reign as Emperor and Empress on the Chrysanthemum Throne.
 
Evoking Famous Poems
 Officials of the Imperial Household Agency confirmed that the fish were fresh and quite delicious, and are usually shared among friends and relatives of the family of the betrothed.
Two elegant but simple unpainted wood boxes carried the other presents, the six 1.8-liter bottles of sake, and the five bolts of silk, lavish fabrics that were selected and named by Empress Michiko. The names, meant to evoke famous poems or tender moments, included "Shining Silk of Birds of Luck," "Black Bamboo" and "Moments of Musical Joy."
The expensive silk -- each bolt of which was about 12 yards long -- will be fashioned into Western-style evening gowns for the Princess-to-be.
"Today, Crown Prince Naruhito presents imperial betrothal gifts to confirm his pledge of marriage with the consent of the Emperor and Empress," said Mr. Kanno, the grand master, after everything was prepared at the home of Ms. Owada's parents.
Ms. Owada responded, according to the tradition, "I accept humbly."
Ms. Owada then paid a visit to the Imperial Palace, wearing a pale yellow kimono. Her father, Hisashi Owada, who happens to be the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, was attired in a morning coat, as was the imperial grand master. Mr. Owada carried a shiny black top hat when he accompanied his daughter to the Imperial Palace after the ceremony in his family's home. Ms. Owada's mother wore a traditional kimono.
Since the marriage plans were reported several months ago, there has been speculation that Ms. Owada, educated at Harvard and Oxford and with a promising career as a diplomat, was being pressed into the marriage and had agreed more out of duty than love. Some have argued, too, that her decision to abandon her career was a bad example for women who want to build lives outside the home.
Such thoughts played no role in today's press coverage, however, which was unquestioning in its celebration of things Japanese and the traditions surrounding a monarchy said to stretch back more than 1,500 years.

HEADLINE: Crackdown On Vendors In the Streets

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that the city would step up its efforts against the 10,000 unlicensed street vendors who have flooded New York City sidewalks with everything from tube socks to fake Rolex watches.
The problem of illegal vendors, long the bane of Fifth Avenue retailers, has now become a hot economic and political issue in the bustling retail areas on 125th Street in Harlem and on Fulton Street in downtown Brooklyn, where the vendors have taken over sidewalks, crowding out and undercutting small black and Hispanic shop owners. The illegal vendors, mostly poor immigrants, now account for 10 of every 11 sidewalk peddlers and cost the city as much as $300 million a year in unpaid sales taxes, officials said. 
 The heart of the crackdown involves seizing the illegal vendors' merchandise. The Mayor said he would assign 36 additional police officers to the 46-member peddler enforcement unit and deploy 31 more city inspectors and other personnel, along with 12 vans and trucks.
 
Mayor Was Teen-Age Peddler
 "We recognize that illegal vending has become a thorn in the side of small businesses and legal vendors," the Mayor told a City Hall audience largely made up of appreciative small businesses interests and shop owners.
But the Mayor said he was not against sidewalk vending and admitted he was a teen-age peddler in his Harlem youth, first hawking shopping bags and later selling Liberty Magazine. "For better or for worse," he said, "street vending constitutes a thriving industry in New York City."
He said he was seeking a kind of balance in which the rights of small businesses and shops were weighed evenly against "an appropriate role for legal vendors." He said such a balance was out of reach so long as illegal vendors were crowding in.
The Mayor's get-tough policy comes at the beginning of his election campaign in which the votes of small shop owners and politically potent organizations that represent them are regarded as far more compelling than the power of illegal sidewalk vendors who are breaking the law and who have virtually no political constituency.
"Let's cut to the chase," said Commissioner Wallace Ford of the Department of Business Services. "The plan is a political positive for the Mayor because it shows him taking action on an issue that has concerns in all five boroughs and which shows him listening to those concerns."
With that in mind, Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President who is running against Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic mayoral primary, said the Mayor's plan was not tough enough and that it offered too little and too late.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the probable Republican candidate, said he was "glad the Mayor finally got a wake up call on the problem because I've been sounding the alarm for two years."
 
Retailers Endorse Plan
 As for the relatively modest number of additional police and inspectors to crack down on 10,000 unlicensed vendors, Commissioner Ford said, "the need for more enforcement in the future is quite possible."
Thomas Cusick, head of the Fifth Avenue Association, described the Mayor's program "as broad based and well thought out."
"Our members can recognize the rights of legitimate street vendors," he said after the Mayor had finished. "But they take umbrage at things like vendors selling counterfeit goods on Fifth Avenue outside the store where the real goods are retailed."
In increasing numbers, small shop owners complain that they must compete against sidewalk vendors who can undercut them because they offer no warranties and pay no rent or taxes.
At the Kay Bee store at 732 Broadway, a sales clerk, Stefaine Joshua, looked hard at the illegal vendors on the sidewalk outside. "They steal what they sell and sell it for much less than we can," she said.
"They crowd the sidewalk and when someone calls the police they run away, but are back doing business 10 minutes later."
 
'Trying to Survive'
 Edward Felder, homeless, unlicensed and selling used record albums in Cooper Square, had a different story.
"I'm homeless and I've got to do something to make a living," he said. "When I panhandled, I was cursed and spit at. Now I'm just selling, trying to survive."
But at Broadway and West Third Street, Shane Pettaway, who has a vendor's license, said: "I think everyone has a right to eat. But it isn't fair if I have a license and pay all these taxes to have someone set up beside me who doesn't."
In addition to stronger enforcement, Mr. Dinkins said the city would reduce the long waiting list for vendor licenses by taking away 355 licenses from military veterans who are not required to be licensed, thus freeing them for 355 applicants who are not veterans.
All told, the city limits vendor licenses to 853, and food carts to 3,000.
 
An Education Plan
 He said the city also would help legal vendors by offering them education and English language courses, small-business management and capital access training, and immigration services.
Mr. Dinkins also said he would create a new Vendor Policy Group headed by Police and Business Services Commissioners. He said the new group would review whether the maximum fine of $200 for illegal vending should be increased; whether a vending license lottery should be established, and whether vacant, city-owned storefronts should be offered at discount rates to legal street vendors.
In addition, Mr. Dinkins said he would support several vendor measures that have been introduced in the City Council, including those that would:
*Restrict the location of book vending tables, which do not require a city license, on crowded sidewalks.
*Provide 100 food-cart permits for disabled veterans.
*Require that all new food-cart permits be issued to individuals instead of corporations, limiting one permit per person.
*Raising the current limit of 853 vending licenses.
Peg Breen, a spokeswoman for Peter Vallone, the City Council majority leader, said, "Over all, the Mayor's legislative package is a good idea." But she said a pending measure seeking to create 2,000 new vendor licenses did not receive much support at a recent committee hearing.

Putting Ideas (Old and New) to Work

BYLINE: By Kirk Johnson

DATELINE: NORWICH, Conn.

 BODY:
DAVID COUTU and Dale Plummer are both entrepreneurs, both struggling to build small manufacturing businesses in a bad economy, and both tenants in one corner of the old Ponemah Mill complex here. On most other fronts, however, they might as well be in different universes.
Mr. Coutu's company, Intelligent Motion Systems, hits technology at its leading edge, an offshoot branch of robotics, while Mr. Plummer's shop, called the Quinnehticut Woolen Company, uses 75-year-old textile machines, which were bought for the price of scrap, to make wool yarn that is sold in knitting hobby stores. 
 At Intelligent Motion, everything seems clean, with a feel that comes closer to Pacific Rim high-tech than Northeast cotton-mill retread. It is a place of blue jeans and computer screens, where Lynyrd Skynyrd and Billy Joel pump on the radio. Six of the eight employees are engineers or technicians. The technology is cool.
At Quinnehticut Woolen, the technology is old. Everything smells of machine oil, and spun wool fibers cling to every surface like thin fur coats. The huge machines, some of which were only hours from being trashed as worthless curios, now clatter and roar, run by six employees who also do the marketing and maintenance. There is not a computer chip in the house -- yet.
But both places are holding onto a corner of Connecticut's industrial culture.
Mr. Coutu, a 35-year-old electrical engineer, grew up in Norwich watching the slow death of the Ponemah Mill, which employed his father and once dominated every aspect of life here. Now he competes in world trade with companies in Japan (a shrinking threat, he says) and China (a rapidly growing threat).
Mr. Plummer, a 43-year-old former historian, has it in his blood to love the past, he said, but only became a yarn mogul when he realized that plummeting rents, displaced workers and all-but-abandoned technology had created a market niche. One of his employees, Muriel Denomme, has 26 years in the textile business, through three mills that closed down around her. These are the same machines she ran at her last job.
Ponemah Mills stands hulking by the Shetucket River like a scar from the age of the industrial dinosaur. Founded by two brothers named Taft, who created the Taftville section of Norwich as a company town, it was one of the largest cloth-making plants in the world from the 1870's until it began shutting down in 1962. The company owned all the land, all the workers' homes, all the stores, and even had its own farm.
By the seat-of-the-pants rules that Mr. Coutu and Mr. Plummer must live by as start-up business owners, such large scale operations seem outmoded. That is not to say that today's marketplace is free of bloat and waste. The two men point to the case of the Electric Boat shipyard. Just down the road in Groton, the shipyard is this region's modern industrial leviathan and is shrinking steadily as submarine contracts for the Navy sink with the end of the Cold War.
In January, the state gave Electric Boat $1 million, with only the thinnest strings attached, to help encourage diversification of the product line. Last week, the company that so needed help three months ago said it paid its chairman $29 million in 1992. Mr. Coutu doubled his entire product line last year for only $200,000. The only help he received from the state was a loan, which he must repay.
"There are some industries that you're not going to hang onto," Mr. Coutu said. "How many Band-Aids are we going to use before we realize that guns are not really where we want to be spending our money?"
One element of the old ethic of Yankee Connecticut is not widely known: networking. If your uncle or your neighbor had a business, you shopped there. If he needed something, he went to you. It is part of what built the economic vitality of the state. Then, after years of prosperous complacency, the system faded because it was not particularly needed anymore.
Now, in harder times, every small business owner knows that survival cannot be taken for granted, and the old mutual-aid network has been revived. Mr. Plummer has found a nearby machine shop that still knows how to make the parts for his old machines. Mr. Coutu hires out most of his manufacturing locally.
And an even more startling example of cross-pollination is expected, perhaps later this year: Quinnehticut Woolen's first computer component will be built by Intelligent Motion Systems and installed on a 1919 vintage carding machine. The part will allow the machine to adjust its processing wheels automatically to produce the desired weight of yarn -- a small revolution for those still working in the Iron Age.
And there is one more small glimmer from the future: A student from a high school in Norwich worked part time at the woolen company last year and liked it enough to want to come back this summer after graduation to learn the old skills.
"We were very pleased with him," Mr. Plummer said. "As soon as he's available, I'd like to hire him."

Inflation News Takes Effect: Yield Falls on 30-Year Bond

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Yields on Treasury bonds and notes dropped yesterday as investors and traders bought securities in a sharp but delayed reaction to positive news on inflation last week.
The surge in buying, which began on Thursday with a report showing restrained producer price inflation in March, has brought the yields on Treasury bonds and notes back within striking range of the lows reached at the beginning of last month. 
 A report on Friday that the Consumer Price Index rose just a tenth of a percent in March reinforced the belief that inflation will remain low, even if it ends up a little higher than the 2.9 percent increase last year. But the bond market was closed for Good Friday, so the response to that positive news did not come until financial markets opened in Asia on Monday, which was Sunday night in New York.
In fact, most of yesterday's jump in prices came before trading opened in New York.
"The minute the market opened overseas, they gapped up," said Matthew Alexy, a government bond trading strategist at the First Boston Corporation who was watching bond prices leap in the Japanese market Sunday night. "The inflation data generated a powerful move in prices."
But some of the gains from East Asian trading (leading European markets were closed yesterday) were lost in a day of moderate dealings in New York. The price of the 30-year bond, which was up 110/32 early in New York trading, was just 24/32 higher in late trading in the secondary market. The yield fell to 6.79 percent, from 6.85 percent late Thursday. The 16-year low yield on the 30-year bond was 6.72 percent, set on March 8.
The price of the 10-year note, which was up 23/32 earlier, ended up 11/32 ; the yield fell to 5.91 percent from 5.96 percent on Thursday. The 20-year low for the yield on the 10-year note was 5.82 percent on March 4.
The price moves were smaller on shorter maturities, in part because inflation affects these issues less than it affects longer-term securities. But prices of short-term Treasury bills did gain, which is a positive sign for the overall market because it reflects a belief that the Federal Reserve is not close to raising short-term rates.
At the weekly auction of Treasury bills yesterday, the average discount rate on the three-month bill was 2.88 percent, down from 2.92 percent last week; the average discount rate on the six-month bill was 2.98 percent, down from 3.04 percent.
 
 
Fears Are Eased
 The bond market has sold off since early March because of concerns about rising inflation. Traders and investors were not worried about a surge in prices, but because many had bet that the rate of inflation would decline this year, they were concerned that sharp jumps in the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index in January and February signaled that price increases would be higher than anticipated.
The low increases for March seemed to ease fears about inflation, but the reports did not give assurance that the rate of price increases would fall this year. Because this question is still open to debate, it is hard to say what the outlook for the market is from here, analysts say.
On a short-term basis -- the next couple of weeks -- it appears there is a chance for yields to move lower, perhaps to new lows. Data expected on the economy, including retail sales for March, which are due out today, are expected to show growth at a moderate annual pace of 3 to 3.5 percent, at best. This means little pressure on prices is expected.
 
 
Small Borrowing Needs
 In addition, the very small borrowing requirements of the Treasury this quarter will help to support prices, as will continued speculation about cutting the size of the 30-year bond auction. Estimates of the Treasury's borrowing needs are around $25 billion or less, and some analysts are predicting that the 30-year bond auction expected in May will be skipped.
But beyond a few weeks, the course could be more erratic. If the April jobs data once again fool the market expectations -- as the jobs report has in the last two months -- and are stronger than expected, then inflation will be thought about again. And that would make the April price indexes a focus again. If they came in above expectations, just as the March data came in well below, any rally could be limited.
And as the second quarter draws to an end, traders and investors will have to focus again on the expected large borrowing needs of the Treasury in the third quarter. These estimates are in the $100 billion range.
 
 
Yields Could Hit New Lows
 Mr. Alexy of First Boston said that since inflation concerns have been calmed for the moment, the yields on Treasury bonds and notes could move to new lows. But he also said there might have to be a correction first, given the fact that the price of the 30-year bond, for example, has jumped more than 2 points in the last two trading days, while the yield has dropped 16 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
He also warned that today's Treasury auction of seven-year notes could have a negative impact on the market if it does not go well.
"In the past, it has been viewed as a catalyst," he said of the seven-year note, which makes "it difficult to read market signals around the seven-year auction." In trading yesterday in the when-issued, or pre-auction, market, the yield on the seven-year note was 5.51 percent, down from 5.58 percent on Thursday.
Following are the results from the Treasury's auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

Saudi Takes A Big Profit In Citicorp

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Cashing in on what may be one of the smartest investment moves in recent years, Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia sold more than 8.9 million shares of Citicorp stock yesterday for $268.1 million, nearly two and a half times what he paid.
In late 1990 and early 1991, Prince Waleed, one of 4,000 members of the Saudi royal family, invested nearly $800 million in Citicorp when its shares were depressed because of the bank's problems with bad real estate loans. 
 Now, with the bank on the rebound and its stock trading at its highest level in three years, Prince Waleed decided to take some of his profits, selling about a sixth of his total investment in Citicorp, said Faissal M. Fahad, the Prince's lawyer in San Francisco.
 
Big Block Is Traded
 A block of 8,914,566 shares of Citicorp stock at $30.125 a share was traded on the New York Stock Exchange at 1:25 P.M. yesterday by Salomon Brothers. A Salomon spokesman declined to say how much of the stock the firm was keeping on its own books and how much it had already sold to customers.
Traders and bank stock analysts said the market was bullish on Citicorp stock and that finding a buyer for the shares, which represent 2.4 percent of those outstanding, would not be difficult.
"The stock has been widely recommended and there is strong earnings momentum and price momentum," said Judah Kraushaar, a bank analyst with Merrill Lynch. Moreover, with interest rates again heading lower, "the market has been buying bank stocks with a little bit of reckless abandon," he said.
Citicorp stock closed yesterday at $30.25, up $1.125. With more than 11 million shares traded, the stock was by far the most active on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock is very different now from what it was at the end of 1990, a year in which the price of Citicorp's stock fell by half. That fall, Prince Waleed bought 16.6 million Citicorp shares for $207 million, or about $12.40 each.
 
Financed by Citibank
 The 37-year-old prince is an entrepreneur with various interests and is chairman of the United Saudi Commercial Bank. He received much of the initial financing for his enterprises from a Saudi Arabian branch of Citibank.
To replenish its capital in early 1991, Citicorp also sold Prince Waleed 5,900 shares of a special nonvoting preferred stock that yields 11 percent and is convertible into 36.875 million new shares of common stock at $16 a share.
If they were converted today, those preferred shares would represent 9.1 percent of Citicorp's common shares. After yesterday's transaction, Prince Waleed apparently still has 7.7 million shares of his initial investment of 16.6 million common shares, or 2.1 percent of the shares outstanding.

Stocks Surge on Positive Inflation News

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market came to attention yesterday, mainly because of hard-to-ignore good news on consumer price inflation.
The rising stock tide lifted, if not all the boats, at least a fair number of them. 
 The rally was in contrast to the listlessness last week, which persisted whether the perception had been good (wholesale inflation is low), bad (Philip Morris profits will drop) or dubious (Coca-Cola and other brand names will suffer, too).
Seven prominent blue-chip stocks, all rising a point or more, pushed up the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday. They included J. P. Morgan, Aluminum Company of America and Philip Morris.
 
 
Surge in Transportation Issues
 Perhaps on the theory that an expanding industrial sector would need planes and trains to distribute goods and services, the Dow Jones transportation average rose to its second record high in three trading sessions. Nine large transportation companies dominated trading, including Consolidated Rail; UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and AMR, parent of American Airlines.
The Dow Jones industrials rose strongly throughout the day, closing at 3,428.09, up 31.61 points, with an advance in the morning of as much as 36 points. The Dow transportation average jumped 35.46 points, to 1,648.84.
Broader market indexes also posted robust increases. The New York Stock Exchange's composite Index rose 3.07 points, to 246.91, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 6.53 points, to 448.57, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 6.79 points, to 673.12.
But the trading volume was a less-than-torrid 261.5 million shares, far below the more than 323 million shares during what traders are calling Marlboro Friday -- April 2 -- when Philip Morris said it would discount its main product. Advancing stocks led decliners yesterday by 13 to 6.
Investors received their first chance yesterday to react to the tame one-tenth of 1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index in March, which was announced by the Government Friday when most markets were closed for Good Friday. The small increase in March producer prices, reported Thursday, had been similarly encouraging.
 
 
'Temporary Worry'
 "We had some temporary worry about inflation until the figures came in," said Gene J. Seagle, vice president and director of technical market research at Gruntal. "The market's reactions, as usual, were overblown."
He noted that some of the consumer-products stocks, like Philip Morris and Procter & Gamble, were beginning to recover.
Mr. Seagle saw yesterday's surge as a sign of a summer rally in the next several weeks. "But seriously," he said, "I believe this will probably take the Dow to the next round number, which is 3,500."
Some other market watchers were not impressed by yesterday's buying.
"I would very much like to have seen different leadership" in the stock gainers, said Lawrence R. Rice, chief market strategist for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross.
 
 
'Cash Is Trash'
 He noted that some of the most prominent leaders were airlines and casino stocks like Casino Data Systems and President Riverboat. "This market is following the old 'cash is trash' scenario," Mr. Rice said. "But I wish they'd put their money in depressed quality groups like pharmaceuticals, food and computers."
Among other issues, Citicorp, the big bank, jumped 1 1/8, to 30 1/4. But three-quarters of the 11.9 million shares traded could be traced to a Saudi prince, who had announced in February that he planned to a sell a big block of shares.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Japan's Stimulus Program Drives Dollar Even Lower

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar skidded to yet another postwar low against the yen yesterday, as investors bet the Japanese Government's economic stimulus plan would further strengthen the yen.
Trading was relatively quiet, as the European markets and some markets in Asia were closed for Easter Monday. 
 Gold prices, meanwhile, moved lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery in June fell 70 cents, to $338.20 an ounce, as concerns about inflation waned.
The dollar finished trading in New York yesterday at 112.80 yen, down from 113.12 yen on Friday. During the day, the dollar traded as low 112.75 yen.
The dollar also fell against most other leading currencies, losing more than a pfennig, to 1.595 German marks.
 
 
'Single Biggest Factor'
 "The single biggest factor for the yen right now is the fiscal stimulus package" in Japan, said Frank Pusateri, a vice president at the Bank of Boston. Japan plans to spend more than $100 billion to bolster its slumping economy.
The yen, up 10 percent on the dollar so far this year, is expected to go higher if the stimulus works, traders said. People are buying yen because they think Japan has "more ability to rebound," even though economic conditions are worse there than in the United States, Mr. Pusateri said.
The yen started breaking records in Tokyo trading overnight, until the Bank of Japan stepped in to stem the currency's rise, traders said. The yen resumed its rise in New York trading, with the dollar closing near its lows.
Some traders expect the Japanese currency to reach 111 yen to the dollar before Friday, when President Clinton is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in Washington.
"You've got to have a strong yen before the meeting," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange adviser at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. Japan is under pressure from its trading partners to shrink its swelling trade surplus, and Mr. Miyazawa will be eager to point to the yen's record strength as a means of achieving that end, Mr. Johnson said.
That means the Bank of Japan will not be aggressive in its efforts to slow the yen's rise, Mr. Johnson said. A stronger currency makes a country's exports more expensive and is considered less destructive than tariffs for shrinking trade imbalances.
Persistent concern about the pace of the American economic recovery clears the way for more gains by the yen, traders said. Last week's producer and consumer price reports showed the economy was not building enough steam to fuel inflation, indicating that new economic reports would be weaker than expected.
Elsewhere, the British pound jumped 1.7 cents, to $1.5455, as investors turned more optimistic about Britain's economy.

HEADLINE: Meeting of Minds on Pine Barrens' Future

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MELVILLE, L.I., April 12

 BODY:
After years of bitter confrontation, developers and environmentalists held peace talks today on the future of the Long Island Pine Barrens, a 100,000-acre expanse that sits above the purest drinking water left on the Island.
"We've checked our guns at the door and are giving conciliation its first real chance," said Edwin M. Schwenk, executive director of the Long Island Builders Institute. "The time has arrived for us to settle our differences peacefully." 
 He said the Long Island building community had about $11 billion worth of real estate tied up in the Pine Barrens. "So our pocketbook needs to know where we can build and what we can build."
But he added: "Just because we're builders doesn't mean we're not concerned about the environment. Many of us have grandchildren and we want to leave behind a heritage they'll all be proud of."
 
Spirit of Cooperation
 There were no major breakthroughs today, but after the many battles of recent years, even an attempt at conciliation was remarkable.
An environmentalist, Kevin McDonald, vice president of the Group for the South Fork, noted that President Clinton went to the Pacific Northwest last week on a similar quest "to set the stage for cooperative efforts to protect the environment while encouraging the economy."
"We're applying the same spirit and approach," he said.
Development in and around the Pine Barrens, which cover nearly a fourth of Long Island's East End, was the subject of a lawsuit brought by environmentalists more than four years ago. They sought to bar construction on 224 real-estate projects in the area, arguing that state environmental law required the towns of Brookhaven, Riverhead and Southampton to assess the cumulative environmental impact before approving individual projects.
But the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, dismissed the case in November, observing that while the protection of the Pine Barrens was vital to the health of the Island's population, there was no binding plan to preserve its vast water supply.
But the ruling did not mean the battle was over. Construction in the Pine Barrens remains on hold, not only because of lingering environmental questions, but also because of a slow economy with little demand for new housing and commercial office space.
"With respect to what's happening here today," Mr. Schwenk said, "I think it's about time, and I'm looking forward to getting this all behind us."
 
Reconsidering Land Use
 Mr. Schwenk was among almost 300 leaders from business, government and environmental groups who gathered in the ballroom of the Radison Plaza Hotel here this morning, seeking to achieve a balance between the preservation of the Pine Barrens and real-estate development.
John Bierwirth, former chairman of the Grumman Corporation, said the clash between environmentalists and people who need space in which to grow their businesses was nationwide.
He said it was time to reconsider ways to re-use land that has already been developed but is standing idle. People who would buy such land should be relieved of the liability for cleaning pollution they might find on and beneath the land, he said.
"It's time to tell Albany to change the rules," said Mr. Bierwirth, who is also president of the Long Island chapter of the Nature Conservancy, which last year designated the Pine Barrens as one of the 12 "last great places" in the Western Hemisphere.
James L. Larocca, executive director of the Long Island Association and one of the sponsors of today's meeting, warned of the continuing economic impact of stalled development in the Pine Barrens and elsewhere on the Island. He said this all had to be balanced against a loss of from 100,000 to 125,000 jobs since 1989, as well as loss of 25 percent of the Island's youth between the ages of 18 and 24 over the last five years.
Richard Amper, executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, the organization which brought the suit against the builders, said this morning that he "looked forward to developing a plan that would be fair to the environmental community and to the building community."
"No one is saying any longer, 'We're either going to pave the place over or absolutely halt all growth.' We don't hear that from anybody any more." Mr. Amper said. "We're hearing for the first time that proper planning will allow us to do both."
He welcomed suggestions from Terrence Moore, executive director of the New Jersey Pinelands Commission, and Armando Carbonell, executive director of the Cape Cod Commission, who said they went through many of the same problems that Long Island was now experiencing.
Mr. Moore predicted that the meeting would mark a turning point for the Pine Barrens. "Eventually a solution has to be found." he said. "At least there is agreement that the Pine Barrens is a special place, and that's a good place to begin."

Sears Said to Be Near Pact to Sell Coldwell Banker

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company is nearing an agreement to sell its Coldwell Banker Residential Services unit to the subsidiary's management and two investment groups, one of which includes the Texas investor Robert Bass, people close to the negotiations said yesterday.
Sears said in September that it was planning to sell the unit, which has more than 2,000 brokerage offices nationwide and a mortgage servicing group, as part of its effort to shift its energies back to its core business of retailing. No estimate was available on what Coldwell Banker might fetch. 
 The backers of the management acquisition attempt are Bain Capital of Boston and Acadia Partners, a partnership based in Fort Worth whose investors include Mr. Bass. While none of those involved -- Sears, Coldwell Banker, Acadia or Bain -- would confirm that a sale was pending, people close to the negotiations confirmed a report in Crain's Chicago Business that the talks are "in final negotiations."
 
 
Strengthening Market
 The prospective purchasers are most likely interested in Coldwell Banker because the residential real estate market has recently strengthened as interest rates have declined. Many real estate companies, large and small, went out of business or cut back sharply as a result of the market's problems of the 1980's and their further repercussions. But Coldwell Banker, an established brokerage and relocation company that is one of the top in the country, said its residential real estate transactions last year increased 14 percent over the previous year, while total sales of existing homes in the United States were up only 9 percent for the year.
Coldwell Banker said that one in every nine homes sold in America in 1992 involved a Coldwell Banker sales associate. The unit earned $19 million in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared with $1.6 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier.
A Coldwell Banker spokeswoman referred calls to Sears. When asked about the report, Perry Chlan, a Sears spokesman, said: "We have not announced any agreements regarding the planned sale of Coldwell Banker. The actions related to the planned sale of Coldwell Banker are proceeding as planned."
Owen Blicksilver, a spokesman for Acadia Partners, said the group would have no comment. Adam Kirsch, general partner of Bain Capital, said, "We're in the acquisitions business, and we can't comment on transactions whether or not we're working on them."
Joseph Ronning, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, noted that Coldwell Banker had turned its business around over the past year, partly as result of tighter management and partly as a result of favorable market conditions.
 
 
'Best Level' in Years
 "The residential real estate business appears to have turned," he said, adding that "housing affordability is at its best level in a number of years."
Consequently, the Coldwell Banker Residential unit might well be considered a good investment with considerable growth potential if the economy remains stable or grows.
Sears is known to be eager to spin off the unit, and has announced that it wants to have a deal completed by June. Further, both Bain and Acadia tend to invest where there is strong management, and a management buyout fits this strategy.
One analyst speculated that the attraction of the deal was the Sears Mortgage Banking Group, which operates as a part of Coldwell Banker. The mortgage banking group, through its Sears Mortgage Corporation, Sears Mortgage Securities Corporation and Sears Savings Bank, increased its mortgage loan production 43 percent, to a record $11.75 billion in 1992, from $8.2 billion in 1991.
 
 
Two Sales Possible
 Although this might be an attractive business for Acadia and Bain, one person close to the negotiations suggested that Coldwell Banker and the mortgage banking group would be sold separately.
For Sears itself, the move is part of a strategy to shrink and concentrate on retailing, in line with its September announcement that it would sell its Dean Witter Financial Services unit and part of its Allstate Insurance Group, as well as spin off Coldwell Banker.
When Sears announced the plans in September, analysts said the moves would more than halve the company's $38 billion debt load. The company started to accumulate debt in the 1980's to finance its expansion into financial services, even as it invested money in store renovations and new promotions of its retail stock.
Sears stock rose $3.375 a share, to $44.75, on the day Sears made its announcement in September. Yesterday, it gained 37.5 cents, to $53.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Price of Natural Gas Soars On Reports of Tight Supply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Natural gas futures prices soared to a five-month high on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday in reaction to reports of tightening supplies.
Natural gas for May delivery soared 11.5 cents, to $2.344 for 1,000 cubic feet, the highest settlement for a near-term contract since Nov. 18. 
 In other energy trading on the New York Merc, light crude oil for May delivery rose 24 cents, to $20.46 a barrel. May heating oil climbed 0.53, cent, to 56.52 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline rose 0.26 cent, to 60.24 cents a gallon.
Natural gas futures have risen for five straight days, gaining more than 15 percent since April 2, in reaction to industry reports showing the amount of gas in storage to be 15 to 23 percent below year-ago levels.
 
Buying Distant Contracts
 Yesterday, the average price to secure gas through a 12-month supply agreement on the cash market reached $2.30 for 1,000 cubic feet, which suggests buyers think prices are unlikely to drop.
"People are so confident the market is going higher that they're willing to buy aggressively for the farther-out months," said Thomas Blakeslee, an analyst at Brody, White & Company in New York.
The use of natural gas as an alternative to petroleum-based fuels is expanding at a time when supplies have been drawn down by the coldest winter in several years.
Mr. Blakeslee said demand was depleting the excess supply "bubble" that has long characterized the natural gas market and held down prices.
David Pruner, president of KCS Energy Risk Management Inc. in Edison, N.J., said it was too soon to declare the bubble burst. But, he said, "If these prices hold on during the summer, we are willing to go ahead and say the bubble dissipated."
In other commodity markets, livestock and meat were mostly higher, while most grains and soybean futures rose.

HEADLINE: Large Role For Russia Expected On Station

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
STRIKING new details have emerged about the plan announced last week to invite Russia's collaboration in designing a sharply smaller outpost for American astronauts. It now appears that Russian aid will amount to far more than mere ideas, as a pivotal ground rule of NASA's proposed redesign makes clear.
If at all possible, the redesigned space station is to fly in an orbit where the angle of inclination to the equator is 51.6 degrees, according to NASA experts and internal agency documents. That seemingly obscure figure speaks volumes, for it is a path through space that has been used exclusively by Moscow for virtually all its manned voyages. 
 For reasons of orbital geometry, the United States would have to adopt such an unusual orbit if it were to rely on the Russians for substantive help in launching a joint space venture. America used that orbit only once before, in 1975, when Apollo and Soyuz capsules joined briefly some 140 miles above the Earth to mark a thaw in the cold war. Daniel S. Goldin, Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said yesterday in an interview that teamwork with Russia and use of the 51.6-degree inclination were requirements stemming from the need to boost the space station's capabilities while cutting its construction costs by up to two-thirds. The highly inclined orbit, he said, would give the revamped outpost greater powers of Earth observation and pave the way for wide Russian participation.
"It's not absolutely necessary but it opens up all the new vistas," he said of the 51.6-degree orbit, adding that its utilization was a general goal of the redesign process. "We said, 'Shoot for 51.6. If you can't get it, tell us the best you can do.' "
The space agency's 50-member redesign team was informed of Moscow's entry into the turbulent nine-year history of the space station by Dr. John H. Gibbons, the White House science adviser, on April 3 as President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia discussed the issue at the Vancouver summit meeting.
"The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs," Dr. Gibbons told the team, an agency statement made public last week showed. "Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal."
In recent years Moscow and Washington have increasingly teamed up on relatively minor space projects. But experts say that designing and building a space outpost together, if it comes to that, would be a watershed in East-West relations.
 
Competition to Cooperation
 "We have implemented a process that a few years ago would have been inconceivable," said a White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's ironic," the official added, "but cooperation with the Russians may help us save a program that conflict with the Russians begat," referring to the space program's cold war roots.
The space station effort was begun in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan and was to be a high-technology triumph over Moscow, which had a long history of success with outposts for astronauts. Although design work has so far consumed more than $8 billion, the planned outpost has long been mired in technical and political problems. Most recently it was envisioned as a 350-foot-long structure costing some $31 billion, its price seeming to rise almost daily.
The United States is turning to the Russians for help mainly in an effort to cut costs and only secondarily to advance a post-cold-war agenda, the White House official said. Moscow itself has independently and vigorously promoted such an East-West realignment.
On March 16, two top Russian officials, Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian space agency, and Yuri Semenov, head of Russia's main rocket builder, NPO Energia, wrote Mr. Goldin to propose a celestial union.
 
'They Want You to Buy'
 "Billions of dollars" could be saved, the Russians wrote, by the "unification of efforts" of the two nations to realize a "joint advanced orbital station." They made no mention of the beneficial effects that Western currency could have on idle Russian production lines.
"When the Russians say they want to cooperate," noted the White House official, "they mean they want you to buy their hardware."
The two Russian officials called for a physical merger in space of an upgraded version of Moscow's station currently in orbit, Mir, with elements of the Western plan, including an American laboratory, the European laboratory "Columbus" and a Japanese experimental module. The outpost could house three astronauts by 1997 and, with further expansions, nine astronauts by the year 2000.
 
Offering Better View
 The Russians proposed an orbital inclination of more than "50 degrees, providing essential capabilities for Earth surface observation." This is considered a strong selling point given the push for global data on climate change and habitat destruction.
A law of orbital geometry says the area of Earth surveillance increases with rising inclination. This is because the angle at which an orbiting spacecraft crosses the equator is just another way of stating extremes of latitude it hits as the Earth turns beneath it. For instance, an outpost orbiting at 50 degrees inclination to the equator would travel across the Earth's face as high as 50 degrees north latitude in Canada and as low as 50 degrees south latitude near the tip of South America. A smaller angle of inclination means less of the Earth's surface is visible.
Although the American space shuttles are usually launched due east from Cape Canaveral over the Atlantic, at an inclination of 28.5 degrees, they can go as high as 57 degrees and still avoid land. The shuttles have done so occasionally for Earth-observation missions and other reasons.
In theory the Russians have less flexibility. They fly their manned missions from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Central Asia, which is located at 45.9 degrees north latitude. If spacecraft flew due east from there, getting the greatest possible boost into space from the Earth's own rotation, they would have an orbital inclination of 45.9 degrees. But they never do since this path would take them over neighboring countries.
 
Avoiding China and Mongolia
 Instead, the Russians fly slightly higher at an inclination of 51.6 degrees, staying over their own territory during the fiery ascent and avoiding the risk of dropping astronauts or spent rocket stages on Mongolia or northern China.
Just as the Russians lose some rotational boost by flying a more northerly course, so will the Americans if they link up with the Russians in Moscow's traditional space orbit. In fact, NASA experts say shuttles launched from Cape Canaveral would loose about one-third of their payload-lifting power. This is clearly a drawback of the cooperative plan, since the shuttle's powers are already overtaxed for the planned lifting of big outpost modules.
One aid would be the debut of more powerful shuttle booster rockets, which were once envisioned as starting work around 1996 but now have been delayed to the year 2000.
James E. Oberg, an American specialist on the Russian space program and author of "Red Star in Orbit," said a different kind of aid would be for the Russians to move toward the preferred American orbit by bringing their own inclination down to 45.9 degrees, the best one for Russian rockets energetically.
 
'Cold War Fossil'
 "Operationally, dynamically and politically," he said, "51.6 degrees is a cold war fossil."
But experts at two NASA centers said an inclination of 51.6 degrees was now a ground rule in station redesign. And late last month agency headquarters in Washington issued an internal document stating that the new outpost should have an "orbital inclination to provide dual access by multinational launch systems."
Such an orbit is a necessary but not sufficient condition for close East-West teamwork, so exactly what will become of Moscow's participation in the effort remains an open question.
Experts say a 51.6-degree orbit could allow the Russians to do as little as making symbolic visits to an American station, or as much as becoming major partners in constructing and putting it into orbit. Mr. Goldin noted in the interview that the orbit would also allow stranded American astronauts to be rescued by Moscow. Not weighing such merits, he said, "would be irresponsible."
 
$25 Billion Savings?
 An intermediate possibility for cooperation was sketched out in the October 1992 issue of Aerospace America by Dr. Jerry Grey, director of science and technology policy for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, a professional group based in Washington.
He posited that American shuttles from Cape Canaveral would ferry astronauts to an orbit of 51.6 degrees but carry no cargo, and that the 20-story Russian rocket known as Energia, the world's most powerful, would blast off concurrently loaded with American station gear.
Only four such pairs of launchings would be needed to produce a full station, he wrote, in contrast to more than 30 shuttle flights if the United States did the job alone. Shuttle flights are estimated by private experts to cost about $1 billion a piece, and Energia flights about half that, so the savings on transportation alone could in theory amount to about $25 billion.
Dr. Grey noted, however, that the Energia is a new vehicle whose reliability is unproven.
Moreover, he said in an interview, "a whole bunch of questions exist about whether we can rely on the Russians with their economy the way it is," adding, "And integrating the space programs would not be easy. You run into severe engineering problems."
But if these and other questions can be addressed with open-eyed realism, he said, "the benefits of a truly international space program far exceed the costs."
Mr. Yeltsin, in his prepared statement on April 4 at the end of the Vancouver meeting, said the foundations had been laid for a peaceful new era of space exploration.
"We decided to cooperate in this area and decided to join forces," he told reporters.
Mr. Clinton echoed those remarks, saying he saw "real opportunity for joint activity."

HEADLINE: U.S. Cracks Door to World Forest Agreement

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
THE Clinton Administration will offer an olive branch this week to tropical countries on the bitterly divisive issue of protecting the world's forests, according to Administration and State Department officials. Environmentalists say the move might eventually open the way for negotiation of a world forest treaty.
It could also be one of a series of actions this spring and summer signaling an Administration intention to reassert American leadership on international environmental issues after the Bush Administration's diplomatic floundering at the Earth Summit last year in Rio de Janeiro. 
 The meeting often pitted developing countries jealous of their valuable natural resources against industrialized countries who see uncontrolled exploitation of those resources as dangerous to the global environment. Nowhere was the clash more rancorous than over the issue of forests.
Tropical countries led by Malaysia, a major timber exporter, charged that the main burden for protecting forests was being forced on them by temperate countries that had long since over-exploited their own forests. Malaysia and its allies torpedoed an American-led effort to negotiate a forest treaty even before the summit began, and the United States and its allies were lucky to salvage even a weak statement on forest management principles.
 
Talks on Timber Agreement
 The forum for a possible start in recouping the situation is the opening of talks today in Geneva to renegotiate the 1987 International Tropical Timber Agreement. Under the agreement, countries that export tropical timber undertake voluntary efforts to exploit their forests while preserving them ecologically. Tropical forests contain a majority of the world's dwindling store of plant, animal and microbial species. But the tropical countries, charging discrimination and unfair competition, want the agreement expanded to include forests in temperate countries like the United States and subarctic climates like those of Canada and Russia.
Environmentalists support this view and want the agreement to have some teeth as well. If tropical and temperate countries agree on these issues, they hope, the rancor that has surrounded the forest question will be dispelled and the main roadblock to negotiating a treaty for all types of forest exploitation will be removed.
The Bush Administration adamantly opposed expanding the timber agreement to include temperate forests. But officials close to the situation, who would speak only on the condition that they not be named, said that American representatives in Geneva were there with an open mind and would explore ways in which both temperate and tropical countries could pledge themselves to a policy of harvesting timber while preserving forests. This goal of sustainable cutting of trees would be achieved by the end of this decade under proposals for revising the timber agreement.
"We could agree to those kinds of principles," said one Administration official, who added that the United States would acknowledge in Geneva that some complaints by tropical countries about a double standard were valid. But how any agreement on principles gets translated into specific provisions is critical, and it is far from clear that the United States can ultimately agree with tropical countries on the details.
Further, it is unclear how an effective agreement applying sustainable harvesting principles to temperate countries would affect forestry practices in the United States itself. The Administration is wrestling now, for instance, with how to reconcile economic and ecological interests in the Pacific Northwest, and the outcome of that dispute is far from assured.
 
Shift Would Be Significant
 No conclusions are likely to be reached in four days of meetings this week in Geneva, said a State Department official involved in the talks who characterized this first round as exploratory. A second round of talks is to take place in late June.
The United States has been the spokesman for the temperate countries' caucus in preliminary meetings leading up to the timber talks, and any shift in its position would carry great weight. Its new stance is therefore "very, very encouraging," said Bill Mankin, the coordinator of the Global Forest Policy Project of the National Wildlife Federation, Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth.
"It's the first opening, the first break" in the temperate-tropical impasse on forests, Mr. Mankin said.
The rebuff to the Bush Administration on forests at the Earth Summit was accompanied by an outcry over its standing alone among major countries in refusing to sign the global biodiversity treaty designed to help protect the world's array of biological species. It was also widely criticized for winning weaker controls than other countries wanted on emissions of heat-trapping gases that could cause global warming.
The Clinton Administration has been engaged in a reassessment of international environmental issues.The Administration is reviewing the biodiversity treaty and is widely expected to reverse the Bush policy and sign the pact. It has also signaled to a meeting of countries that negotiated the global-warming treaty signed in Rio that the Administration was willing to consider stronger steps to control heat-trapping gases.
On forests, Mr. Mankin had this to say: "The Bush Administration dug a deep hole for us to get out of, and the Clinton Administration is beginning to peek over the edge and say, 'H-m-m. What's outside this hole?' "

HILLENBRAND IN TALKS TO SELL AMERICAN TOURISTER

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Hillenbrand Industries said yesterday that it was in talks to sell its American Tourister luggage-making unit. Hillenbrand declined to name the potential buyer or the asking price. The company, based in Batesville, Ind., said that it had retained Morgan Stanley & Company to help evaluate options. Analysts said they expected the company to complete a sale within two months. American Tourister had about $100 million in sales last year, about 7 percent of Hillenbrand's $1.43 billion total. The unit has been hurt by weak business travel and sluggish consumer spending.

HEADLINE: Anger at Tokyo Grows in Asia

SERIES: Japan: The Consummate Trade -- Two Case Studies -- First of two articles

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
After decades of focusing its exporting sights on the United States and, to a lesser extent, Europe, Japan is now in a race to dominate trade in East Asia, the world's fastest-growing region. And it is succeeding with a strategy that is as well crafted as it is irritating to many of the region's countries.
What is emerging is a new source of anger over Japan's trading practices that goes beyond the war of words between Washington and Tokyo to Japan's already difficult relations with its Asian neighbors. 
 This is one reason that President Clinton's tough line on Japan strikes a resonant chord in this part of the world. South Korea and other Asian countries complain about many of the same practices that American companies cite: They call Tokyo's export policies predatory and insist that there are tough barriers to selling foreign products in Japan.
Tokyo's trade surpluses have been transformed from an issue with the United States into a global matter.
 
Beyond Consumer Goods
 Japanese companies have built their products into the engine of this region's growth by selling not just consumer goods like cars and electronic gadgets, but the industrial equipment and manufacturing technology on which Asian exporters depend. As a result, the trade surpluses of Japan with South Korea, Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries are rising far more swiftly than its surpluses with Western countries.
"We're hooked on Japan, I'm afraid," complained Lee Sang Yul, director general of the international trade bureau at the South Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry. "When the Korean economy was just beginning to develop, we had to rely on Japan for technology and parts. Once we had their systems, we kept buying them. So as our exports to the rest of the world increased, our imports from Japan had to grow."
Japanese officials "have this model in which Japan controls everything, and they are just applying that model to a new area, Asia," said Chuh Young Souk, vice chairman of the Korea-Japan Economic Association, an industry body.
 
 
Steep Rises in Surplus
 Over the last four years, Japan's trade surplus with East Asia has more than doubled, to $42 billion last year from $18 billion in 1989. By contrast, Japan's surplus with the United States declined in that period, according to Japanese figures, to $43.7 billion last year from $45 billion in 1989.
Japan's exports to East Asia -- $116.4 billion last year -- now far exceed its exports to the United States, which came to $95.9 billion.
"Everyone in the world has the same problem with Japan," said Suh Sang Mok, a member of Parliament and a key policy adviser to President Kim Young Sam. "It gets to be a friendship and a philosophy issue."
The issue becomes more complicated because many Asian nations, especially South Korea, are protectionists themselves. Several of the Asian "tigers," as these prosperous countries are often called, rely heavily on exports while keeping their markets relatively closed to others.
 Inflaming feelings further is Japan's history of brutal occupation of most of East Asia in World War II -- preceded in the Korean case by modern colonial rule going back to 1910. Such memories help make trade imbalances a tense issue in the region.
Japanese officials argue that the Japanese success in selling a limited range of industrial goods to South Korea obscures the fact that it is all but impossible for Japanese companies to sell consumer goods, from autos to stereos, here. They also complain that the surpluses are more a result of Japanese customers rejecting shoddy Korean goods than a product of trade barriers.
The problems created by Japan's surpluses are acute in South Korea, which is struggling to revive a faltering economy and is clearly feeling a touch of wounded pride in finding itself dependent on its old enemy. Kim Young Sam, the new President, won election in December partly by playing on a perception that the economy was losing its competitiveness; the economy grew by 4.7 percent last year, its worst showing since 1980. The trade deficit with Japan is popularly viewed as another measure of that lost competitiveness.
There is also some oddity in the fact that South Korea has consciously modeled its export-driven economy on Japan's, with one important difference: Japan never permitted its manufacturers to become so dependent on foreign suppliers.
 
 
Trade Reversal for South Korea
 During better times, in 1988, South Korea boasted an overall surplus of $8.9 billion, including a $3.9 billion surplus with Japan. By last year, however, trade had deteriorated to a deficit of $5.1 billion, chiefly because of a $7.9 billion deficit with Japan.
The turnaround was the result of a large increase in Korean imports of Japanese machinery, while Japanese purchases of Korean goods declined. Sales of inexpensive Korean-made consumer products have suffered in part because of the economic slowdown, and partly because they have increasingly been depicted as being of poor quality.
Many South Korean executives and policy makers acknowledge that part of the solution lies in Korean industries' developing higher quality products that are more attractive to demanding Japanese consumers.
But they also complain that several years of trade talks have removed few barriers to the export of Korean goods to Japan. Mr. Lee of the Trade and Industry Ministry said that efforts to open up Japanese markets for foreign-made leather and footwear, for instance, had been fruitless.
"We've been sending export promotion missions to Japan since 1985, but the results are nominal," Mr. Chuh of the Korea-Japan Economic Association said.
And because Japanese equipment and technology are so critical to South Korea's exporting capability, little thought is given to restricting the purchase of these goods as retaliation. The buying just marches on.
Japan has used a variety of methods to expand its trade throughout East Asia. It sends more than half its $13 billion a year in foreign aid to East Asia, and that helps build good will that ultimately benefits commercial relations. Japanese companies are also by far the largest foreign investors in Asia, as they move factories to countries with lower wages.
Perhaps more important, some of Japan's aid to East Asian countries for years had to be used to buy goods and services from Japan; Korean experts say that some of this money was used to buy Japanese manufacturing technology, which began the cycle of dependence. But what has particularly angered some manufacturers is what they say is the reluctance of Japan to sell its most advanced manufacturing technologies.
 "Japan is afraid of the boomerang effect, that products from Korea made with their technology would come back and take over their markets," Mr. Lee said.
For instance, the Samsung Electronics Company in South Korea has complained that the Sony Corporation has refused to cooperate in its efforts to develop a video camera suitable for television broadcasting.
Sony officials in Tokyo deny this, saying that the two companies held commercial negotiations but broke them off because Samsung was not willing to pay an appropriate fee for the camera technology.
Japanese officials offer few apologies for the surpluses. They say they are reluctant to make it easier for Korean companies to sell their products in Japan until Seoul takes stronger steps to liberalize its economy. There are 258 items, from autos and fax machines to television sets, that foreign manufacturers are blocked from exporting to South Korea, Japanese officials say.
 
 
'China Is More Open Than Korea'
 "Their Government does so many things to protect their economy," said Yukio Kitazume, director of the Northwest Asia division at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo. "China is more open than Korea. Honestly speaking, Japanese companies don't believe the Korean Government proposals for opening their market."
He added that the structural nature of the imbalance meant that it was likely to get worse before it got better. The bottom line, Mr. Kitazume insisted, is that until the Korean Government becomes less protectionist, Korean companies can never hope to obtain the best of Japan's technology.
"If Japanese companies could set up 100 percent owned subsidiaries and sell their products in the Korean market, then they would provide high technology," he said.
Some cautious steps are being taken to address these problems. Japan and South Korea reached an historic moment last year when Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Prime Minister, and Roh Tae Woo, South Korea's President at the time, met in Kyoto, Japan. It was the first time the leaders of the two countries had held an informal working meeting, despite their being neighbors.
An important item on the agenda was trade, and Japan agreed to set up a foundation to pursue joint industrial research and to encourage the transfer of technology to South Korea.
"There's a lot of disappointment over this issue, but we realize we have to focus on a few issues ourselves," said Mr. Suh, the Korean legislator. "It's really a question of what sort of identity this region will have."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Double Aid for Russia, Diplomats Say

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, April 14

 BODY:
President Clinton told Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa Tuesday night that American contributions to Russia would increase by at least $2 billion, officials here said today.
The figure would more than double the original $1.6 billion the President had pledged to Russia. 
 In the telephone conversation with Washington on the eve of an international conference here on Russian aid, Mr. Miyazawa reportedly said that his country would offer $1.8 billion in direct bilateral financial assistance to support President Boris N. Yeltsin's programs for democratic change.
The pledges, which are expected to be announced officially here later today at a meeting of the seven richest industrialized nations, should insure that the aid package American officials had sought for Russia will reach $30 billion.
At a news conference today, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen indicated that the telephone call had taken place, but he and other officials remained deliberately vague as to the aid total. He did say that Japanese press reports about American assistance to Russia growing by $2.5 billion were incorrect.
Other American officials, who insisted on anonymity, said President Clinton would offer about $2 billion in trade credits from the Export-Import Bank as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in additional assistance.
President Clinton said in the conversation that he must consult with Congressional leaders before settling the terms of the assistance, the officials here said.
In Washington, a White House spokeswoman, Lorraine Voles, said that Mr. Clinton spoke by telephone to Mr. Miyazawa about "the need for substantial support for Russian reform," but she declined to provide any details or to say whether the President had decided to increase the amount of aid.
The original $1.6 billion pledged at the recent summit meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, was to include $700 million in agricultural credits, $690.9 million in grant assistance and $232 million in other credits.
Mr. Bentsen said at a news conference on Tuesday evening that he was more optimistic this year than last year that large amounts of aid would be pledged and disbursed to push Russia further on the road to a capitalist economy. He said that if the Russian central bank carries through on a pledge to reduce soaring inflation, the prospects for the aid from America, Japan and the other industrial nations supporting change in Russia were high.
 
A New Agenda
 The comments set a positive tone for a gathering that has already established a far different agenda and style from such meetings during the cold-war era. The meeting includes the Foreign and Finance Ministers of the so-called Group of Seven countries, the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
In particular, the early discussions between American and Japanese officials were of a far different nature than those of just a few years ago. In a striking shift of emphasis, Mr. Bentsen and Secretary of State Warren Christopher used their initial encounters with senior Japanese officials here to pressure them to reduce Japan's yawning trade surplus, but said little about the security issues that had dominated the relationship in the past.
The Japanese were at pains to show that they were making such efforts. The Government announced on Tuesday a $116.5 billion program to stimulate its faltering domestic economy. The spending is intended to moderate the growth of Japan's trade surplus by increasing imports.
 
Cordiality With an Edge
 The American officials were cordial in applauding these Japanese measures. But behind the courtliness there was an edge. The Americans made it clear that more would have to be done to revivify Japan's domestic economy and that they expected Japan to continue to take a leading role in assisting Russia, even without progress on a lingering World War II territorial dispute between the two countries.
Mr. Christopher reportedly called Japan's domestic economic stimulus program a "useful first step," and indicated that the United States expected several years of efforts to moderate the trade surplus.
Underscoring the new primacy of economic issues, Mr. Christopher was quoted by a senior American official as using his first meeting with Kabun Muto, the new Japanese Foreign Minister, to ask if Japan would be using some of the new appropriations to purchase American personal computers.
Just a few years ago, such high-level contacts were generally devoted to discussions of the United States-Japan security treaty and military threats in East Asia.
 
Talking Money, Not Security
 "Economic relations must be addressed with great intensity in order to maintain and indeed expand our partnership with Japan," Mr. Christopher was quoted by an American official as telling Mr. Muto. "We're going to have to make progress on economic issues."
Although it is supposed to be secret, just about every Japanese newspaper has reported that the Government will offer $1.8 billion in aid, or $600 million more than was planned a few days ago, because of pressure from other Group of Seven countries.
This will reportedly consist of $1.1 billion worth of trade insurance, $400 million in loans from Japan's Export-Import Bank, and $320 million in relief and help in dismantling nuclear weapons. The trade insurance and loans often require extensive documentation, which has been a stumbling block for Russia in the recent past. It thus remains uncertain if Japan's offer will benefit Russia swiftly.
American officials were critical of Japan's inclusion of so many trade credits in their package.
 The package would represent a big step for Japan, which has been reluctant to provide substantial aid to Russia until it makes progress in returning four lightly-populated northern islands seized in the waning days of the war. Japan did provide nearly $800 million last year, but it also indicated more would be forthcoming if Moscow would negotiate a return of the territories, part of the Kurile chain.
The difficulties that that policy presents were painfully in evidence when Mr. Muto contradicted a Foreign Ministry paper released on Tuesday.
Mr. Muto, who became Foreign Minister only last week, declared that Japan was dropping any linkage between aid and the territorial dispute. He said, for the first time, that the need for democratic change transcended Japan's bilateral problems.
The ministry's position paper noted, however, that while Japan has been providing financial assistance to Russia for the past two years, the island issue is standing in the way of "further full-scale cooperation in Japan-Russian Federation relations."

HEADLINE: Recycling Answer Sought for Computer Junk

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELLEVILLE, N.J.

 BODY:
Eric Buechel tours his domain at a brisk pace, assessing his inventory with the pragmatic humor of an undertaker. In his warehouse sit rows of hulking computers, each weighing tons. They once whirred and flashed, but now they rest cold, unplugged, discarded.
"This is where mainframes come to die," Mr. Buechel declared, smiling and patting one of the big metal boxes with mercenary affection. 
 Mr. Buechel's company, Advanced Recovery Inc., is one of several offering an entrepreneurial response to a looming environmental problem: millions of obsolete computers.
 
Byproduct of Efficiency
 This unwelcome byproduct of the computer age, oddly, is the result of technology's virtuous spiral -- ever-lower prices for increasingly powerful machines. Consequently, American businesses and individuals are discarding their old mainframes, personal computers and work stations at a rate of more than 10 million a year.
Recognizing the problem, the computer industry and the Federal Government have begun collaborating to cope with this high-tech headache. A joint industry-government study last month concluded that developing a "green work station" -- one easier to upgrade or recycle than discard -- is now "both a business and technological issue, not simply a mission for the environmentalist movement."
If the pace of discarding continues, some 150 million computer carcasses will reside in the nation's landfills by the year 2005, according to a Carnegie-Mellon University study. The disposal costs alone for the machines could be $1 billion, ignoring the landfill space required -- an acre of land dug to a depth of three and a half miles, room to stack about 15 Empire State Buildings end to end.
"The numbers are huge and it could be an enormous environmental problem," said Mark Greenwood, director of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Pollution Prevention. "But we also believe that companies can make choices in the design and manufacture of computers that reduce the environmental impact, and open up great new areas for recycling."
Which is precisely the opportunity Mr. Buechel sees for Advanced Recovery, a two-year-old company that has become one of the nation's largest computer recyclers. Business is booming.
Situated 10 miles west of Manhattan, the nine-person company is handling 400,000 pounds of computers and other electronic gear a month, four times the volume of a year ago. Mr. Buechel, the 34-year-old president, expects revenues to jump to $3 million this year, and he is looking for more space.
Outside the warehouse, there are piles of personal computers of every make and model, some clearly outdated but others just a few years old. "A hot machine one year is tossed out the next," Mr. Buechel said.
At Advanced Recovery, the cast-off computers are pulled apart and mined for metals from aluminum to gold. The semiconductor chips are plucked out and sold to parts wholesalers and computer maintenance shops. But what can't be resold is trucked away -- and dumped in a nearby landfill.
The computer industry, now hoping to largely eliminate the landfill from the machines' life cycle, is proving a willing conscript to the green movement. Many of the industry's leaders grew up in the 1960's and 70's, reading the Whole Earth Catalogue and schooled in the tenets of environmentalism.
It is also an industry accustomed to change and attuned to international standards -- and aware that Europe, led by Germany, is taking some pioneering steps in recycling computers.
The United States Government views the computer-industry effort as a model of its new "Design for Environment" program in which business and government collaborate early to prevent pollution rather than having the E.P.A. be the cop that tries to catch corporate polluters after they have damaged the environment. This collaborative approach, along with stressing the competitive and marketing advantages of green products, is to be a hallmark of the Clinton Administration.
"And the computer industry is a very good partner," said Mr. Greenwood of the E.P.A.
 
Saving Electricity, Too
 The industry's collaborative approach seems to have been a success on another environmental front: energy conservation. For more than a year, computer companies and the E.P.A. have worked to cut electricity consumption of desktop personal computers by half, by putting them in the electronic equivalent of hibernation when they are turned on but not being used.
Prototypes, which deploy energy-saving chips and circuitry, were demonstrated last fall. The E.P.A. will begin issuing "Energy Star" logos for approved machines in June, and the machines are expected to be widely available by next year. Dozens of companies have signed up, including I.B.M., Apple, Compaq, Dell and Zenith Data Systems.
The E.P.A. estimates that converting the computer population to the Energy Star standards will result in an energy saving of 26 billion kilowatts annually by the year 2000. That amounts to the yearly electricity consumption of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine combined, said Brian Johnson, director of the Energy Star program. Viewed in terms of curbing pollution by reducing the volume of fuel burned, it is the equivalent of taking five million cars off the road.
But the mounting pile of obsolete computers remains the more difficult environmental challenge. An ambitious study of the problem completed last month by the Government and an industry consortium, "Environmental Consciousness: A Strategic Competitiveness Issue for the Electronics and Computer Industry," sought to lay out the issues and serve as a guide for efforts by the computer companies, chip makers and others.
 
Design, Not Disposal
 "The key is designing for the environment instead of trying to cope with environmental problems at the end of the pipeline -- disposal," said Greg Pitts, the environmental project manager for the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, an industry consortium, which coordinated the study.
In pursuit of a green computer, companies are beginning to work on changing the manufacturing process, using recyclable materials, minimizing the amount of materials used, and altering designs so that computers can be easily taken apart for recycling.
In Research Triangle Park, N.C., J. Ray Kirby heads the International Business Machines Corporation's Engineering Center for Environmentally Conscious Products. For a year, Mr. Kirby's team has worked on recycling the plastics used in I.B.M. personal computers. Plastics in old machines are coded by polymer type and, starting this summer, Mr. Kirby plans to begin making housings and parts with a blend of recycled plastic and fresh resin.
"The goal we're working toward is to keep all I.B.M. products out of landfills," Mr. Kirby said.
 
'It's Cost Avoidance'
 Recycled plastic is cheaper than virgin resin, as long as collecting, sorting and rendering the old plastic can be done economically, Mr. Kirby notes. Another incentive for recycling, he says, is the prospect that companies are going to be held responsible for their old machines.
"It's cost avoidance," he said. "Either you do something with it, or you're going to have to pay to take it away."
Starting next year, computer companies in Germany will be forced to reclaim their old machines when consumers no longer want them. The rule is part of the German "take back" law that applies this year to packaging of all types of products, and next year will cover all electronics products, from hair dryers to mainframe computers.
There are several dozen computer-recycling companies in Germany, but it remains unclear whether there will be an efficient market for the machine dismantling, metals marketing and parts reselling that will result from the new law, according to German computer executives. If not, they say, the effect will be to increase costs to producers, who will then have to pass them along to consumers through higher prices.
"The German system relies on compulsion, while the U.S. is trying to let market forces and innovation do it," said Joachim Tabler, a Munich-based environmental specialist for the Apple Computer Corporation.
 
Giving Them to Others
 Alex Randall is one man who believes that dismantling, recycling and melting down old computers is misguided nonsense. He is president of the East-West Education Development Foundation, a Boston-based charity, that refurbishes second-hand computers and gives them to groups deemed worthy in 130 countries.
The foundation's computers are used for everything from monitoring elections in the Ivory Coast to running municipal governments in Romania. Less than 3 percent of the world's population has ever touched a computer, Mr. Randall notes.
"Ninety-seven percent of the people on the planet would regard an outdated I.B.M. PC as a ride on a rocket ship," he said. "Melting the thing down is not its highest and best use. None of these machines should die. In the right hands, they are mind-enhancing tools."

HEADLINE: Huge Stimulus Package Is Announced by Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, April 14

 BODY:
Japan announced on Tuesday a $116 billion stimulus plan, the biggest in its history, to rescue its faltering economy. The announcement gave a furious boost to the recent rally in the Tokyo stock market as a feeling spread here that an end to the nation's persistent recession, while not around the corner, is at least in view.
The stimulus package, consisting of increases in public works spending and various business incentives, had long been expected, but its size, 13.2 trillion yen, was higher than the 12 trillion yen figure that had been anticipated lately. 
 That helped the stock market's Nikkei index of 225 stocks convincingly smash through the 20,000 level by soaring 858.15 points, or 4.3 percent, to close at 20,740.29 Tuesday -- its highest close in more than a year. At its close today, the market was down 206.91 points, or 1 percent, to 20,533.38.
 
 
Goal for G.N.P.
 Japanese Government officials said the stimulus program would add about 2.6 percent to Japan's nominal gross national product in the year after its enactment, virtually assuring that Japan would meet its 3.3 percent growth goal for inflation-adjusted G.N.P. for the fiscal year that began April 1.
"It's a big, very potent package," said Robert Alan Feldman, director of economic research for Salomon Brothers in Asia. "Its enough to bring fiscal 1993 growth above 3 percent."
But other economists said that company profits and capital spending remained depressed and might not be helped much by the plan. Noboru Kawai, chief economist for Morgan Stanley in Japan, said the increased spending might allow companies to work off their swollen inventories but might not lead to increased production. Others noted that consumer spending is weak and that the Government rejected the idea of an income tax cut, partly because it feared a budget deficit.
 
 
True Stimulus
 Economists estimated that only 5 trillion yen to 9 trillion yen of the 13.2 trillion yen total represented a true stimulus, which in Japan is being called "ma mizu," or pure water.
Some of the money goes for things like purchases of land, which merely transfers an asset from one party to another. In other cases, like in Government-backed housing loans, the Government might merely displace private lending, resulting in no net gain to the economy.
Other economists said that company profits and capital spending remain depressed and might not be helped much by the plan. Noboru Kawai, chief economist for Morgan Stanley in Japan, said the increased spending might allow companies to work off their swollen inventories but might not lead to increased production. Others noted that consumer spending is weak and the Japanese Govermment rejected the idea of an income tax cutpartly because it feared a budget deficit.
Some private-sector economists estimate the package might increase growth by only about 1 percent or so. Moreover, they said, the plan alone would not lead to a full recovery.
"I do think they will be successful in fending off the great depression that was possible in Japan," said Jesper Koll, economist at S. G. Warburg in Tokyo. But he estimated that even with the package, Japan's economy would grow only 1.5 percent in the fiscal year that began this month.
 
 
U.S. Pressure
 Nor is this plan likely to fully satisfy the United States, which wants Japan to stimulate its economy so that its purchases of American products will increase. The stimulus package is perhaps the main plan to reduce Japan's trade surplus that Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa will bring with him Friday when he is scheduled to meet with President Clinton.
But the Clinton Administration has been known to have made known its views to Japan that parts of the previous stimulatory plan were more cosmetic than real. Those same features are in the new plan, making it likely that the new plan, too, will come in for criticism. The United States Government has expressed its belief that Japan, which has a budget surplus, should be willing to use deficit financing to spur its economy.
Moreover, Japan's Government rejected the idea, favored by some American businesses, of setting aside a specific amount of purchases under the stimulus plan for imports, saying only that "due consideration will be given to foreign products."
A senior Administration official said that Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived here Tuesday to attend a Group of Seven ministerial meeting on aid to Russia, told Japan's Foreign Minister, Kabun Muto, that the stimulus package was "a useful first step," but that "Japan needs several years of economic growth for the world economic system to be fully revitalized."
And Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who was also attending the meeting here, said today: "You have to look beyond the headlines and get into some of the detail. What we want to see on the part of Japan is a continuing stimulus to increase demand within the country."
 
U.S. Program
 The Administration has been pushing for a somewhat similar, although much smaller, economic stimulus program for the United States. The $19.5 billion plan is frozen in the Senate by a Republican filibuster.
The Japanese plan will be paid for through construction bonds and through a Government program that draws on consumer savings through the postal system. The United States has complained that this latter source of financing merely diverts money to the public sector that would have otherwise been invested by the private sector and is therefore not a true stimulus.
Last August, Japan announced a stimulus plan worth 10.7 trillion yen, or about $94 billion. That plan does not seem to have had much effect yet. But officials and economists say that because of delays in passage of the necessary legislation, the spending it called for is only now beginning.

HEADLINE: U.N. Appeals for More Funds To Relieve Hunger in Bosnia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 13

 BODY:
The United Nations issued an emergency appeal for more food for Bosnia and Herzegovina today as five Security Council members raised the flag of revolt against the attempt by the United States and Russia to delay new sanctions against Serbia.
In Geneva, Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, wrote to aid-giving governments expressing "deep alarm" at the shortage of food for the 2.8 million people now dependent on United Nations rations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 She told these governments that there had been "no response" to her appeal last month for $817 million to cover relief needs for the rest of the year in the former Yugoslavia.
 
Less Than Half of Needed Food
 Mrs. Ogata, who coordinates the relief efforts there, said she currently had less than half of the food needed for Bosnia and Herzegovina between now and June. As a result she is diverting funds from health, sanitation and shelter programs to meet the more pressing needs of the hungry.
While Mrs. Ogata sought to keep the United Nations relief program alive in Bosnia, five members of the Security Council began planning a revolt they promised on Monday when they strongly attacked the Clinton Administration and Russia for seeking to delay new sanctions against Serbia to help President Boris N. Yeltsin's chances in the April 25 referendum on who rules Russia.
The five are Venezuela, Cape Verde and three Muslim countries -- Pakistan, Morocco and Djibouti.
They are trying to win enough support on the 15-member Council to gain a 9-vote majority. That would enable them to win procedural motions forcing an immediate vote on a new sanctions resolution that has been accepted in principle by all Council members except Russia.
President Yeltsin would then face a difficult choice between angering Russian nationalists at home on the referendum's eve by voting to punish the Serbs, their fellow Orthodox Christians, or coming out publicly in Serbia's defense just after the brutal shelling of Srebrenica and Sarajevo on Monday by vetoing the new sanctions.
 
Shelling Angers Washington
 The shelling of Srebrenica has particularly angered the Clinton Administration, diplomats here say, because Washington thought Moscow had promised to persuade the Serbs not to attack the beleaguered Muslim town as part of an agreement last weekend on delaying the sanctions vote until after the referendum.
Britain, France and Spain, the three European Community members on the Council, have gone along with the Russia and the United States, though only reluctantly.
"We have to do something now," Venezuela's United Nations representative, Diego Arria, said today. "What guarantee do we have Russia and America won't say they want a further delay after the referendum to let Yeltsin consolidate his position?"
Diplomats say the United States and Russia plan to appeal to Serbia later this week to use its influence with Bosnian Serbs to persuade them to sign the peace plan prepared by Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, the mediators, and already accepted by the leaders of Bosnia's Croats and Muslims.
But the omens are scarcely encouraging. After visiting President Milosevic of Bosnia last week, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly I. Churkin of Russia said he was bringing back new proposals that would make the Vance-Owen plan more acceptable to the Bosnian Serbs. But on Monday Mr. Vance and Lord Owen told the Council that the Russian changes were based on longstanding Serbian territorial demands unacceptable to the other ethnic factions.
Diplomats say Mr. Vance and Lord Owen believe that the only hope of shifting the Serbian position lies in rapidly applying new sanctions, especially those banning shipment of goods through Yugoslavia and the freezing of foreign Yugoslav assets.

Chart/Map: "Balkan Update"
In GENEVA, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees appealed to Western governments to donate food for Bosnia, saying current supplies will run out within days for millions of people.
About 650 people arrived in TUZLA aboard United Nations trucks after fleeing SREBRENICA, where Serbian shelling killed more than 50 people on Monday. In SARAJEVO, senior United Nations officials harshly condemned the attack. "Those firing the guns at Srebrenica knew that the town was packed with many thousands of displaced people, mainly women and children," one senior official said.
In PARIS, the French Defense Minister confirmed that Lieut. Gen. Philippe Morillon would soon be replaced as the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia.
And in WASHINGTON, the United States released its seventh report on war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, again cataloguing a horrifying series of mass murders, rapes and torture mostly attributed to Bosnian Serbs.

HEADLINE: Educators Find a Lot to Like in a Little Increase

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
Even though President Clinton has proposed increasing Education Department spending by less than 2 percent for the next fiscal year, his new budget is winning praise from education groups because of its emphasis on those at either end of the public-school ladder: preschool children and high school students who need job training.
The $31 billion Education Department budget for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1 is up $511 million from this year's $30.5 billion. But it does not tell the whole story. The department's programs would be supplemented by others in the Departments of Commerce and Health and Human Services, in a spirit of cooperation between Federal agencies that analysts and educators say is rare. 
 The Commerce Department's proposed budget, for example, includes $64 million for technological improvements like satellite dishes, wiring for computers and television montoring systems to help schools in isolated areas receive lessons from other schools.
Head Start, the Health and Human Services preschool program for poor 3- and 4-year-olds, would grow by about 46 percent, to $4.1 billion in 1994 from $2.8 billion this year. Head Start has been criticized as ineffective, but it still has a large number of supporters, and the Clinton Administration seems to be backing them.
 
Job Training Gets Push
 The Education and Labor Departments would spend $270 million to develop better job training for students not bound for college. And today and Wednesday, officials of the Education and Labor Departments are meeting with representatives of private industry to devise job programs for young people this summer.
"This is a budget in which there's a very close link among these agencies," said Gordon Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, an association of state education commissioners and superintendents. "It's the first time in at least 12 years that there has been a very close fit in this kind of way."
The budget also calls for money for the President's campaign, whose details are still to be announced, to develop academic standards and promote structural changes in schools. In addition, Chapter 1, the Federal program to help poor children reach grade level in reading, math and writing, would receive $7.1 billion in 1994, up from $6.7 billion.
"The Bush Administration first put emphasis on early childhood and job-training programs," said William H. Kohlberg, president of the National Alliance of Business, an organization of 3,500 companies concerned about work-force quality. "But the Clinton folks are improving and increasing that emphasis."
Diane Ravitch, a former Assistant Education Secretary in the Bush Administration, said, "It's not as if people didn't care about programs like job training, but attention from the President helps."
Under the proposed 1994 education budget, financing for elementary and secondary programs would increase to nearly $15 billion from $13.6 billion in the 1993 fiscal year, with nearly half of the proposed increase going to the efforts to help poor children under Chapter 1.
Although the program has been lauded for helping a generation of students, in recent months it has been criticized as ineffective; reports by an independent commission and a Congressionally mandated committee both said it needed more money and better teachers.
As part of the Clinton economic stimulus package, now stymied by a Senate filibuster, Chapter 1 would receive $735 million more this fiscal year, $500 million of which would go to summer programs and $235 million to help school districts adjust to a recalculation in the program's financing formula.
Although the specifics of Mr. Clinton's program for structural change are not yet final, the budget proposes spending $420 million to help establish standards on what students should know and when. Some money would also be awarded to school systems to encourage bureaucratic and curriculum changes.
College education financing would decline to $12.6 billion in 1994, from $13.6 billion. But the popular Pell grant program for low-income college students would receive $6.3 billion, up from $6.08 billion.

HEADLINE: Storm Losses At $1.5 Billion

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: OLDWICK, N.J., April 13

 BODY:
The A. M. Best Company said today that the March storm caused insurance companies $1.5 billion in losses in 24 states and the District of Columbia.
The sum is nearly twice the rating agency's initial estimate of $800 million, released last month. It was based on comparison with storms in November and December. 
 Catastrophes have pushed insurance industry losses in 1993 to $2.2 billion, Best officials said. Among the costliest was the World Trade Center bombing, which is estimated to have cost $510 million in damage. Storms in Texas and Kansas last month caused $125 million and $35 million in damage respectively.
"The industry was hoping to return to more normal levels of catastrophes in 1993, but through March, it has yet to happen," said John Snyder, the senior vice president of Best's property-casualty division. "We currently are on track for another costly year, and we have yet to get through the deadly August-through-October months."
Catastrophes and a low interest rate environment resulted in a 2 percent decline last year in the industry's pretax investment income, its first ever, Mr. Synder said. He added that the industry is more vulnerable to catastrophes because of a rate war and the lack of affordable catastrophe reinsurance.

HEADLINE: Abortion-Rights' Scorned Prophet;
Hated by Both Sides, Bill Baird Raises Hackles, Not Funds

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I.

 BODY:
Mention his name on the phone and Betty Friedan's gravelly voice turns into liquid vitriol. Then she hangs up.
Robin Morgan, the feminist author and editor, who is usually attracted to publicity like an iron filing to a magnet, calls him a "chauvinist" and declines interviews if he's the subject. 
 In the peculiar jargon of condemnation, Roman Catholic Church leaders say they pray for his soul. And their lay allies in the anti-abortion movement , who pummel him with fists and Bibles, teach their children that the former choirboy is nothing less than the Devil incarnate.
So who is Bill Baird? And what has he done to become just about the only person who can get both sides of the abortion battle to set aside their symbiotic hatreds and unite in a common cause, even if it's only their mutual antipathy to him?
The vilification of Mr. Baird, whose unapologetic zealotry leads him to criticize even his ideologic allies, provides a glimpse into the passions that have laid waste to the middle ground in the fight over abortion. But Mr. Baird's struggle also is a story of atonement and how he turned his cause into his life, sacrificing even his family on the altar of his beliefs.
"If I were assassinated, I know what the movement would do: They'd say, 'He was a great warrior, a great fighter. He withstood the test of time,' " laments Mr. Baird, whose clinic here was one of the first in the country to openly offer abortion counseling. "But now, while I'm still alive, they won't take my hand or even let me stand by them."
 
The Father of Abortion Rights
 In the eyes of impartial observers, but especially in his own view, Mr. Baird is the father of the abortion rights movement. It wasn't planned. He came to his mission in 1963 when he was at Harlem Hospital and found a woman screaming in the hall, with a coat hanger protruding from her uterus.
"She died in my arms," Mr. Baird recalls. He's told the story thousands, if not tens of thousands, of times and it's almost rote. But it was his epiphany, and tears still well up at the memory.
One of six children in a strict Lutheran family, he grew up devout, but a bully, in Brooklyn's slums. When he earned cookies in school for his posture, he brought them home to his younger sister, Myra. And he willingly, even eagerly, fought to protect his older sister, Louise, who died from a cerebral hemorrhage when he was 9.
After his sister's death, his trust and faith in God was tempered by doubt. Almost 50 years later, when a child suggested praying for Mr. Baird's severely ill grandson, he snapped that only doctors could help.
 
Insult to Injury
 "I told them if there was a God, what kind of God would give a little kid cancer?" he remembers. "An audience member got up and said, 'I know why your grandson got cancer. God's punishing you.'
"It went through me like a knife. Believe it or not, I wake up in the night and think, 'Could I be wrong and everyone else right? Could I be the Devil?' Then psychic perseverance kicks in and I realize it was just an aberration in cell growths. It may sound corny, but sometimes you feel like death is on your shoulder."
Mr. Baird dropped out of New York Medical College in 1963 when he was forced to choose between books and food for his three children. But the Harlem woman's death made him a guerrilla doctor. He bought a dilapidated truck, converted it into a mobile counseling center, the Plan Van, and in his free time began distributing birth control information in New York City's poorest neighborhoods.
That led to a 1965 arrest on charges of violating state laws restricting the dissemination of such information. Ultimately, the charges were dropped. But while the case was instrumental in relaxing New York's restrictive birth control laws, it also led to his dismissal from his job as the clinical director of a pharmaceutical company. The only work he could find was as a security guard in a mental hospital, for $2 an hour.
His setbacks only made him more obstinate. During a 1967 speech at Boston University, he was arrested on charges of giving a female student a condom and a package of contraceptive foam -- a calculated challenge to Massachusetts' "chastity" statute, which barred distribution of such materials to unmarried people.
Planned Parenthood, in the first of several confrontations that Mr. Baird has never forgiven, publicly derided him as an "embarrassment" and said there was "nothing to be gained" by his case. He was convicted and the judge, accusing him of being a "menace to the nation," sentenced him as a felon to three months in jail. He served 36 days until his release pending appeal.
The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which initially declined to hear it but succumbed to the persistence of Justice William O. Douglas. "The teachings of Baird and Galileo may be of a different order, but the suppression of either is equally repugnant," Justice Douglas later wrote in his book, "The Douglas Papers."
The Court's decision, handed down in 1972, extended access to contraception to everyone. "If the right of privacy means anything," Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote, "it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted government intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."
It was more than just a triumph for Mr. Baird. Justice Brennan's phrase "bear or beget" was a precursor to decisions dealing directly with abortion. The following year, in Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that made abortion legal, the majority opinion cited the Baird precedent five times.
 
Shot at, Punched, Pummeled
 The tide in favor of abortion rights ebbed in the 1989 decision, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, that essentially allowed states to impose restrictions on abortion.
Mr. Baird says the ruling, which galvanized supporters of abortion rights, also led to what amounts to his excommunication from the movement. "It organized women," he says. "They circled the wagons." But most men, he contends, were excluded.
After 30 years on the ramparts, the 60-year-old crusader, who describes himself as "the sexually incorrect Joan of Arc," is clearly exhausted, physically and financially spent. He says he lives on $350 a week and has no insurance. His back constantly hurts. He has trouble carrying his suitcase. "I don't know what I'm going to do when my body breaks down," he says.
 
Burned to the Ground
 He has been shot at in his home, punched and pummeled. In 1979, an unemployed drifter carrying a jug of gasoline and a flaming torch walked into his clinic, which was crowded with 35 patients and 15 staff members, and burned it to the ground.
He opened another clinic in a a poor neighborhood here. Last September, chemicals were poured down the elevator shaft, sending noxious fumes through the building and making several people ill. Two months ago, a fire hose was turned on, flooding several floors. The ceiling outside his office still sags.
Where he once rattled on about his plans, Mr. Baird now interrupts himself with reflections, like a man pondering his funeral pyre and his place in history. "I think I've contributed something of significance to the freedom of millions of women," he says. "But now society says it doesn't want to know me."
Above all, he seems to pine for respect, or at least acceptance from groups that advocate women's causes and reproductive rights. "I hope that Gloria Steinem would say, 'He's suffered enough, let's welcome our brother,' " he pleads. But like a rebellious teenager, he can't resist damning himself in the next phrase, saying that Gloria Steinem would even not give him credit for enabling her to use birth control.
Among the attacks on the people whose support he desperately craves, there is a verbal stiletto for Faye Wattleton, the former president of Planned Parenthood.
"It's obscene for anyone to be paid $200,000 a year and to be called a crusader," he says. "Look at what I've done with nothing. Imagine what I could have done with Planned Parenthood's budget. The women's groups think that righteousness is measured by money, by bloated bank accounts. But I measure it by commitment, by dedication, by success."
In her book, "Going Too Far," Ms. Morgan suggested Mr. Baird's mission was an effort to get women to sleep with him, and called him "one of the more male-supremacist men around."
 
Steinem Won't Shake Hand
 Ms. Steinem, like many of her colleagues, has refused to shake his hand. Ms. Friedan, who has suggested he is a Central Intelligence Agency plant, stammered in a 20-second telephone interview that she wouldn't talk about him, called him "irrelevant," and, when questioned, hung up.
Mr. Baird has been estranged from his wife, Evelyn, and their five children since he moved them out of state after receiving death threats in 1971. "They became quite conservative, very religious," he says. "They talk to me about Jesus Christ and tell me he is my savior. I tell them I don't know any saviors. I've lost my children: they talk to me, but they don't want to hear about their father and his wars."
"My life is sad," he says. "I wish I could tell you it's happy."
The story of his life, he says, is that of Don Quixote, with one difference -- in his version, Mr. Baird wins. Nonetheless, he says he wants "The Quest" ("The Impossible Dream") played at his funeral.

HEADLINE: Clinton Finds a Friendlier Chamber of Commerce

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
Grabbing for a piece of the Republican coalition, President Clinton went to the United States Chamber of Commerce tonight, stoking a feud between the powerful business group and conservatives in Congress.
The chamber has infuriated many conservatives who contend that the organization has committed ideological treason by cozying up to the new Administration, particularly in informally supporting elements of its economic program. 
 The hostilities have surfaced in letters between the chamber and House Republicans, and a few dozen companies have threatened to resign from the chamber in protest of its position.
Against that backdrop, Mr. Clinton's participation in a satellite television question-and-answer session at the chamber's headquarters tonight to promote his summer jobs program has stuck in the craw of conservative House Republicans, like John A. Boehner of Ohio.
"The fact that the 'kickoff' for the $1 billion summer make-work program the Administration calls its 'summer challenge' is being hosted by the Chamber of Commerce at its Washington headquarters speaks volumes about how far the chamber will go to appease the new occupants of the White House," Mr. Boehner said.
From the chamber's standpoint, there is more to be gained by good relations with the White House than by partisan loyalty.
"There are a handful of Republicans in the House who got exercised because we didn't trash the Clinton economic program," said Richard L. Lesher, the chamber's president. Asked about Mr. Boehner's comments, he replied: "I would tell him to get real and try to understand that our members care about progress. They don't care about perpetuating partisan gridlock."
The budding relationship between Mr. Clinton and the chamber could not be better demonstrated than by tonight's event, which was sponsored by the chamber and the Education Department and was broadcast to audiences at nearly 3,000 sites around the country.
 
Chamber Cites Ties
 The President sat at a table flanked by Education Secretary Richard W. Riley and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. He answered rather tame questions posed by Mr. Riley and by a caller from New York and one from Texas, both of whom praised the Administration for its education proposals.
And Mr. Clinton had only kind things to say about the chamber. "I want to compliment the chamber on all their efforts at recognizing that without an educated work force, we can grow this economy and remain competitive," he said, "and recognizing that we all have to work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to make things happen. This satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together."
The chamber held similar events during the previous Administration, but President George Bush never personally went to the chamber to participate. In addition to Mr. Clinton's economic package, the chamber is deeply interested in pushing its positions on the President's plans for education and jobs and health care.
Mr. Lesher said in an interview today that relations with the Clinton White House were at least as strong as those under Republican Administrations.
"The relationship we've built with those folks is quite good," he said. "We didn't agree with Bush on a lot of things, and we don't agree with Clinton on a lot of things. In fact, I don't agree with my wife on many things. But you have to have a decent working relationship to get things done."
Chamber officials make no apologies for courting the White House, and Mr. Clinton has been particularly active in seeking the support of the organization as he seeks to prove that his deficit-reduction proposal and plan to stimulate the economy has appeal to the business community. Mr. Clinton was greeted with warm applause when he made an hourlong appeal at the chamber's annual meeting here in February.
 
Steps to Back President
 The group never officially endorsed the economic plan but has taken other steps to back Mr. Clinton. Last month, the chamber reversed its position and said that all businesses should be required to provide health insurance for their workers.
"I think we've had a real productive relationship with the Chamber of Commerce so far this year," said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director. "I mean, I think most members of the chamber know that it's time to do something serious about getting the deficit down, and know that we have to get the economy moving."
But conservatives said they felt betrayed by the chamber, and some demanded that members lead a dues strike and demand the ouster of the chamber's top officials. They said tonight's event was the latest example of the chamber's playing up to whomever is in the White House.
Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader; Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, and other Republicans warned in a recent letter to the chamber: "In the interest once again of serving as an alarm bell ringing in the night, we wanted to alert you to a rapidly spreading frustration and anger with the chamber's failure to take an aggressive posture on the Clinton economic program." The letter went on to say that "your current posture is unacceptable."
 
Counter-Campaign by Chamber
 As conservatives mobilize to oppose the chambers' overtures to the Administration, the chamber is also waging a counter campaign to win public support for its position. The chamber is sending packages of letters to news organizations from member chapters that laud its efforts.
Gerald L. Bartels, president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, wrote to Mr. Lesher: "I wanted to let you know that I think the strategy of trying to work with the Clinton Administration is a good one, even though we probably have fundamental differences with them on almost every score. It's not that we should cave in to their ideas, but rather try to keep a seat at the table, so that we can get the most satisfactory legislation possible for our members."
In another letter to the chamber, Alisa Learner Maher, director of issue analysis for the Chrysler Corporation here, wrote, "You should be proud of the fact that the chamber has tried to take positions which are less ideological and far more pragmatic than other business organizations in town."

HEADLINE: Bond-Accounting Shift Is Approved

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, on a 5-to-2 vote, approved a new financial standard yesterday that will force banks and other financial institutions to report profits or losses when the market value of many bonds in their portfolios changes.
The board also moved toward issuing another standard, one that would require banks to take losses when they renegotiate loans with troubled borrowers. It is hoped that final action on both rules will be completed by June 30, when the terms of two board members expire. 
 The bond accounting standard was approved when James Leisenring, the board's vice chairman, reversed his position and voted yes. "I really just decided that while it was not my first choice, it was better than the alternative of doing nothing," he said in an interview after the vote. "We had a responsibility of doing something."
Under a two-year-old rule, the F.A.S.B. can issue rules only if at least five of the seven members approve. Thus, the proposal would have died had not Mr. Leisenring changed his vote.
Under the proposal, banks and other financial institutions that own debt securities would have to declare whether they intend to hold a given security until maturity. Unless they do so, they would have to report profits and losses when the market value of the bonds rises or falls.
While there are still formalities, requiring the board to generate a final draft signed by each of the five supporters, yesterday's vote probably ends a long battle on the issue. Some of the board members, including Mr. Leisenring, had hoped for a broader standard, one that would have allowed companies to adjust for the market value of their liabilities as well. But that was dropped when it became clear that it could not win five votes.
Under current accounting, some financial institutions have classified their bonds as investments, thus allowing them to not record changes in market value on their income statements. But some regularly sell such bonds when prices rise, producing reported profits. The new rule is supposed to make that more difficult to do.
 
Opposition to Measure
 The measure was opposed by banking organizations, which expressed disappointment yesterday. "The capital volatility that will occur when interest rates move is the worst thing our bankers will be experiencing," said Marti Sworobuk, a spokeswoman for the Savings and Community Bankers of America.
The board's action won praise from Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, who called it a welcome step to remove bank financial statements "from the world of fantasy."
The proposed loan rule relates to "impaired loans," that is loans on which the borrower is expected to be unable to meet the original terms. Under current rules, many banks do not report losses if they expect to receive all the principal back, even if the interest payments are to be reduced or eliminated.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
New Basis For a Rally In Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
With concerns about inflation dampened by restrained price increases in March, a new theme is popping up in the bond market. And if it catches hold, yields on the 30-year bond and other Treasury securities could break the historic lows reached at the beginning of March.
"The next story is going to be that the economy is running out of gas," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers. "There is that body of thought out there and you can't ignore it." 
 Many forecasters agree that the economy is growing at a slower pace than the nearly 5 percent clip at the end of last year. But they are talking about sustained moderate growth, like 3 percent annual growth after adjustment for inflation.
The "out of gas" predictions are for a much sharper deceleration in the rate of growth, perhaps to 2 percent. And some forecasters even think that the economy's pace will slow so much that the Federal Reserve will again have to lower short-term interest rates to prevent the economy's tank from getting close to empty.
 
The Power of a Theme
 Themes can catch on in markets and carry them for some time -- and then turn out to be wrong. When themes grab attention, economic and other data are often interpreted accordingly, causing the market to overreact. The concern about inflation moving higher was the theme that knocked the market off its highs and sent yields up in March.
The surprising 1 percent decline in March retail sales, reported yesterday, played right into the pronouncements of economists who have contended that inflation is an overrated concern because the economy is growing much more slowly than in the consensus outlook.
The fact that February sales, excluding automobiles, were revised downward to an increase of one-tenth of a percentage point, from the original nine-tenths of a point, also supported the new theme that the economy is more sluggish than believed.
The retail sales decline helped push the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.74 percent early in the day, just above the 16-year low of 6.72 percent reached on March 8. But the Treasury auction of seven-year notes, which were sold at an average yield of 5.54 percent, did not go well, leading to a decline in prices in the early afternoon. Enough buyers returned later, however, and the price of the 30-year bond ended up 4/32 with the yield down to 6.78 percent, from 6.79 percent Monday.
 
Rates Down on Bills
 In addition, the discount rate on the three-month Treasury bill was pushed down to 2.83 percent and the rate on the six-month bill to 2.96 percent, showing that there are some investors and traders who are betting that the Federal Reserve will again have to ease short-term interest rates. Both discount rates are below the Fed's 3 percent target for the overnight Federal funds rate.
Stephen Slifer, a financial market economist at Lehman Brothers, is saying that the gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew at an annual rate of 2 percent to 2.5 percent in the first quarter of this year and that the same pace will hold during the next three months. For the second half of the year, he is looking at 3 percent growth because he expects the low level of long-term interest rates to give a boost to the economy by encouraging investment and lowering the debt burden on both consumers and businesses.
"I am slower than the consensus," he said. While he does not feel that the economy is growing slowly enough for the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates, he said the rate decline on short-term Treasury bills shows that there are many others who do. He argued that for the Fed to ease, the economy would have to grow at a rate of less than 2 percent this quarter and next. The retail sales report is making him re-examine his forecast, but he is not sure if he is ready to knock it below 2 percent.
He is concerned, however, that the recent decline in the nation's money supply may mean that his forecast is too strong. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the money supply as measured by M-2, which includes currency in circulation, checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposit, is declining by close to a 2 percent annual rate.
The decline in the money supply may be making others pay some attention to the slow-growth theme. While not all forecasters put as much stock in the ups and downs of the money supply, they acknowledge that the data cannot be ignored.
Mr. Lipsky argues that the "out of gas" forecasts are wrong. "Just as the 'Sky is falling, inflation is here' turned out to be a short-lived phenomenon, the 'run out of gas' phenomenon will also pass," he said.
But he is quick to add that the decline in the money supply and the flattening of credit data are disturbing. "If the money and credit growth does not pick up, we will be in trouble," he said.

HEADLINE: A '72 Report on P.O.W.'s Is a Fake, Vietnam Asserts

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, April 13

 BODY:
Vietnam's senior diplomat dealing with United States affairs today described as a "clear fabrication" a document suggesting that 1,205 American prisoners of war were in North Vietnamese prisons in 1972, more than double the number eventually released.
The diplomat, Nguyen Xuan Phong, acting director of the Americas Department at the Foreign Ministry, said in a telephone interview from Hanoi that "we have very strong evidence" to prove "this document is not authentic -- a clear fabrication." 
 The document, recently discovered in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow, has alarmed former officials in Washington and scholars of the Vietnam War, who say it may prove that hundreds of prisoners were never released, and are now almost certainly dead.
 
Tracing the General
 The document is a Russian translation of what is described as a September 1972 report prepared for the Vietnam Politburo by Gen. Tran Van Quang, who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the North Vietnamese Army. It describes Hanoi's efforts to keep secret the number of American prisoners.
The report says that in 1972, even as Vietnam was claiming that it held only 368 American prisoners, there were 1,205 Americans in North Vietnamese prisons.
Mr. Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document was a fabrication was to review General Quang's career. In 1972, he said, General Quang was not deputy chief of staff; he was the Army commander in Military Region 4, in central Vietnam, a post he held from 1966 to 1974.
"Gen. Tran Van Quang had nothing to do with the general staff of the Vietnamese People's Army," Mr. Phong said. "There would be no reason for Gen. Tran Van Quang to have prepared this sort of report."
A member of Mr. Phong's staff, Nguyen Ba Hung, said General Quang had never held been deputy chief of staff of the Army. "That's why it sounded very funny when we heard this report," he said. "Those who have knowledge about the war and about the Army would have a better understanding."
 
Diplomatically Awkward
 General Quang, now retired, is the director of an organization of Vietnamese veterans. Foreign Ministry officials said that, while they had not spoken to General Quang about the document, his staff had said the document was a forgery.
The document's release comes at a delicate time: Vietnamese officials are preparing for meetings in Hanoi next week with John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general who has been dispatched by President Clinton to discuss the issue of missing servicemen.
When the general's visit was announced this month, the Vietnamese took it as a sign that President Clinton might be prepared to move quickly to relax the 18-year-old United States embargo on trade and loans to Vietnam. Vietnam, one of the world's poorest nations, has abandoned Marxist economics and is eager for foreign investment -- specifically American -- in its newly free markets.
But Hanoi's optimism about the outcome of next week's meetings appears to have faded with the release of the document from the Soviet archives.
 
An Agenda Changes
 Now, it appears, General Vessey's trip will focus largely on the authenticity of the document, and thus on the possibility that hundreds of prisoners were alive at the end of the war but were never freed.
The State Department said Monday that General Vessey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has served since 1987 as a Presidential envoy on the issue of missing Americans, will make the document his "first order of business" in Hanoi.
"Obviously this document is not favorable for the course of relations between the two countries," Mr. Phong said. "It will raise suspicions from the American people. But I don't think the document is able to reverse the belief that Vietnam has cooperated very well in this humanitarian issue over the fate of the missing Americans."
Under the 1973 peace settlement between the United States and North Vietnam, 591 American prisoners of war were released from North Vietnam. When the last were freed, in April 1973, Hanoi said no more prisoners were left -- an assertion it has maintained ever since.
Mr. Phong said he was optimistic that United States officials would see the document as a fabrication, and that it should not delay efforts to normalize diplomatic and trade relations.
"I have worked with United States Government representatives for seven years," he said. "I believe that they are careful to distinguish the truth from the fabrications. I hope the American people can distinguish that, too."

HEADLINE: Radio Receivers May Be Catching Echo of Big Bang, Scientist Says

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
A leading astrophysicist reported today that radio receivers in space and on the ground might be recording the passage of cosmic gravity waves, huge perturbations of space that echo the almost instantaneous expansion of the infant universe 15 billion years ago.
The scientist, Dr. George F. Smoot of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, said gravity waves initiated by the "inflationary epoch" of the universe -- a split-second period during which many theorists believe the universe expanded at nearly the speed of light -- might be discernible in data now being collected. If that is correct, scientists would have a powerful new tool for studying the birth of the universe. He reported his findings in a lecture at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. 
 One year ago Dr. Smoot caused a sensation among astrophysicists with his announcement that the haze of microwave radiation reaching the earth from space is somewhat irregular in intensity, depending on the direction from which it comes. Since this microwave radiation is believed to be the afterglow of the Big Bang that is generally thought to have created the universe, irregularities in its intensity apparently reflect the somewhat lumpy distribution of matter in the very early universe.
 
Density and Gravity Waves
 Many astrophysicists now believe this early lumpiness accounts for the later formation of clusters of galaxies and other regions of concentrated matter observed in the present universe.
But Dr. Smoot and a collaborator, Dr. Paul J. Steinhardt of the University of Pennsylvania, now believe that irregularities in the microwave radio background may be only partly the result of irregularities in the density of matter in the early universe.
Another cause, as Dr. Smoot said today, may be gravity waves still reaching the Earth from the inflationary epoch of the early universe. They could account for as much as half of the microwave irregularities, he believes.
By collecting and analyzing background microwave data gathered by several independent teams using different receivers, Dr. Smoot told reporters, it may be possible to distinguish between irregularities caused by the early lumpiness of the universe and those caused by gravity waves still circulating at the speed of light.
Scientists do not know precisely how the universe got its start, although most theorists believe that the genesis mechanism was related to a well-known phenomenon of particle physics, by which elementary particles of matter can spontaneously pop into existence out of nothing at all.
The only thing they need to become "real" rather than "virtual" particles is some source of energy on which to feed. Physicists have determined that in apparently empty space "virtual" particles constantly come into existence and then disappear but can become real under some circumstances.
But how and why the universe evolved from its first beginnings was a major stumbling block in the progress of cosmological theory until the early 1980's, when Dr. Alan H. Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology devised his inflationary theory, various versions of which are widely accepted today. According to this theory, the universe expanded from its microscopic infancy in less than one-trillionth of a second into an object perhaps a hundred yards across. Having reached that size, the universe then expanded at a much slower rate and is still expanding today.
In 1940, Ralph Alpher, George Gamow and Robert Herman predicted that a Big Bang must have left an echo in the microwave part of the spectrum, corresponding to a temperature of about five degrees above the absolute zero on the Kelvin scale. At the time, most astronomers doubted that any such prediction could ever be verified.
 
Accidental Discovery
 But in 1964, Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr. Robert Wilson of Bell Telephone Laboratories accidentally discovered the predicted microwave background while they were investigating a mysterious source of noise that had turned up in Bell antennas. The microwave signal Dr. Penzias and Dr. Wilson discovered had an equivalent temperature of 2.7 degrees Kelvin, astonishingly close to the 1940 prediction.
Another landmark in the exploration of the microwave background came last year, with Dr. Smoot's discovery of directional variations in the temperature of the microwave background. Using data gathered by a satellite launched to measure microwave background, Dr. Smoot and his colleagues produced a map of the heavens showing irregularities that almost certainly reflected irregularities in the distribution of matter in the universe as it was only 300,000 years after the Big Bang, when the super-hot universe cooled to the point at which it became transparent to microwave radiation.
 
Starting Small
 Like the universe itself, Dr. Smoot believes, the cosmic gravity waves now circulating got their start as microscopic events, when the universe was less than one-millionth of one-millionth of a second old. A tiny gravity wave initiated by two elementary particles flying apart at nearly the speed of light would have then been amplified by the universal inflation into a giant gravity wave, something powerful enough to distort the space-time through which it travels, even today.
Such a distortion of space-time would distort any radiation passing through it, including the microwave radiation being measured by the satellite. Thus, the irregularities in the microwave background detected by the satellite may result, in part, to cosmic gravity waves, as well as to variations in the density of matter in different parts of the infant universe.
The challenge now will be to sort out the two types of irregularities.
Dr. Smoot said new data from the satellite might provide clues, as will microwave measurements being collected at two observatories at the South Pole and by two instruments to be sent aloft within a few weeks aboard balloons launched from the National Scientific Balloon Facility in Texas.
The task of separating the effects of gravity waves from the effects of density variations in the early universe will depend largely on matching the observational data with various theories, to determine which theory fits best, Dr. Smoot said.

HEADLINE: Mayor Eases Regulations On Sweeping of Gutters

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration, in a second move in two days to address complaints of small- and medium-sized business owners, said yesterday that it will suspend in some areas of the city a requirement forcing businesses to be responsible for sweeping the street within 18 inches of the curb in front of their stores.
Mayor David N. Dinkins announced the action just one day after he said that his administration would step up its efforts to reduce illegal vending by the city's estimated 10,000 unlicensed vendors, another initiative long sought by business owners. 
 In taking these actions the Mayor appears to be diligently courting the support of owners of the city's 200,000 small- and medium-sized businesses, which make up more than 95 percent of the city's business community. The Mayor, when asked if his announcements in the last few days were intended to gain support for his re-election effort, gave a response he has offered repeatedly in the last few months: "We believe that good government translates into good politics. And if that gets votes, so be it."
Many small-business owners have complained about the gutter-sweeping requirement for some time. They are subject to a $50 fine when Sanitation Department employees determine that the gutter in front of a business has too much trash.
 
A Bid for Votes?
 In easing sanitation requirements that have been in effect since 1979, Mr. Dinkins is responding to vehement criticism from operators of small businesses, who have complained about what they have viewed as excessive ticketing and additional expense of doing business in New York City.
Leah Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Dinkins campaign, said that no campaign strategy had been established to appeal specifically to business owners. "We are not targeting small- and medium-sized business owners, per se," Ms. Johnson said. "But the Mayor is very, very concerned about these businesses as part of his economic growth program."
Norman M. Adler, a campaign consultant not involved in the mayoral race, said that Mr. Dinkins's initiatives this week were consistent with the actions of incumbents seeking re-election. "When you look at past campaigns in New York you see that officials with the power to make things better tend to make things better at a faster pace during campaigns," Mr. Adler said. "The small business people have been complaining about these things like crazy. And, of course, if it is a bid for votes, it would not be surprising."
The Mayor stated in a news conference that the suspension of the 18-inch rule will apply for the moment to only 15 of the city's 59 community boards. The Mayor's Office of Operations, which conducts cleanliness ratings, has found at least 75 percent of their streets in "acceptably clean condition."
Sanitation officials explained that there were initially 18 eligible community board districts but that three had chosen not to participate, apparently believing less stringent enforcement would compromise street cleanliness. The program will go into effect on Monday and other neighborhoods can become eligible by matching the 75 percent level by July 1.
The suspension, which will be conducted on a one-year pilot basis, will result in an estimated 4,450 fewer tickets being written for the remainder of the fiscal year that ends June 30. City officials said that there would be a loss of about $250,000 for the rest of the fiscal year. For the next fiscal year, the estimated 26,000 fewer tickets will translate into a loss in revenue to the city of about $1.3 million, officials said.
Store owners in the eligible districts will still be responsible for sweeping the sidewalk areas in front of their businesses and will still be subject to summonses for violations.
While the suspension of the 18-inch rule will mean a loss of revenue to the city during a period of severe fiscal hardship, Mr. Dinkins and city officials contended that it was more important to adopt policies that would keep streets clean but add expense to operating a business.
"It's obviously a source of revenue," said Emily Lloyd, the city's Sanitation Commissioner, referring to the tickets issued business owners. "But obviously we are willing to forgo that because there is another policy goal that we think is more important."
The Mayor also announced that the city would create six sanitation advisory boards in each borough and in an industrial area that will include of city officials, neighborhood merchants and shoppers. The boards will explore methods of promoting cleanliness and curtailing the number of tickets to business owners.

Income at Westinghouse Dips 1.5% in First Quarter

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 13

 BODY:
The strengthening economy has not done much so far for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which reported today that net income from continuing operations in the first quarter of 1993 was down 1.5 percent from a year ago.
Improvements in Westinghouse's broadcasting, power-plant-construction and nuclear-fuel businesses were insufficient to offset sagging military-electronics orders and weak demand for the company's industrial repair services. 
 Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh, said it made $64 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with a net loss a year ago of $246 million, or 71 cents a share.
But the 1992 first-quarter figures included special items -- an after-tax charge of $338 million for pension liabilities and $27 million in net income from businesses the company has since sold or put up for sale. The divisions that generated $64 million in the recent quarter earned $65 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago.
 
Slight Movement in Price
 Westinghouse stock closed yesterday at $15.25, up 12.5 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company said revenue for the quarter had inched up to nearly $1.86 billion from just over $1.85 billion a year ago, but profits from continuing operations fell slightly to $145 million from $148 million and profit margins dipped to 7.8 percent from 8 percent.
"First-quarter results from continuing operations were as expected," said Gary M. Clark, Westinghouse's president and acting chief executive since the ouster in January of Paul Lego by a restive board of directors. "Our objective remains to have improved operating results for the full year compared to 1992, with improvement occurring in the second half of 1993."
The results were close to Wall Street estimates. Analysts noted that Westinghouse has evolved over the years into a company that derives much of its revenue from businesses like military electronics and power systems that do not closely track economic cycles. Westinghouse does not provide details on the quarterly performance of its various groups.
The report did not include any information on the performance of four businesses that the company plans to sell. It has said that it hopes to complete the sale of its electricity-distribution and -control business and its electric-supply business this year, its Knoll office furniture unit next year, and its real estate business in 1995.
In the meantime, revenue and earnings from those operations are excluded from the balance sheet and applied to a reserve fund set up last year to cover the losses of Westinghouse's financial-services businesses, which are also being sold.

HEADLINE: A Small Gain in Faculty Salaries

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
The salaries of college professors increased an average of 2.5 percent in the 1992-93 academic year, the smallest gain since the American Association of University Professors began keeping track in 1971.
The average faculty salary is $46,270 a year, ranging from $80,280 for full professors at private, independent universities with doctoral programs to $18,500 for lecturers at two-year colleges. The findings were based on an association survey whose respondents included 90 percent of the nation's college teachers. 
 Daniel S. Hameresh, an economics professor at Michigan State University who is chairman of the association's Committee on the Economic Status of the Profession, said the average college teacher who was 28 years old in 1971 has seen his or her income increase by 12 percent, while a counterpart in private industry makes 25 percent more than in 1971.
The figures also show that women who are full professors earned on average 88.2 percent of the salaries paid to men who are full professors, and those who are associate professors, 93 percent. Women who are assistant professors were paid 92.3 percent of the salaries for men at the same rank, while female instructors were paid 94.4 percent of male instructors' salaries .
Professor Hamermesh said there had been "essentially no change" in the gap between male and female salaries over the last 10 years.
The association said "real" salaries, adjusted to account for the 2.9 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index, actually lost ground by four-tenths of 1 percent over all.

HEADLINE: Compaq and Microsoft Plan Alliance

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 13

 BODY:
Two powerhouses in the personal computer industry, the Compaq Computer Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation, today announced an alliance to develop innovations intended to keep their momentum going.
The companies said they would work closely to develop small hand-held machines, easy-to-use technology like wireless communications, pen-based machines, and features for desktop models like compact-disk devices that many analysts regard as important growth areas. 
 William H. Gates, the chairman and chief executive of Microsoft, told reporters in a telephone conference that several products from the collaboration would be available within six months, but he declined to say which ones would be first.
"We are taking the boundary between systems software and hardware, which is the place where a great deal of innovation is taking place, and committing the two companies to working together," Mr. Gates said. "It's the most significant agreement we have done with a PC company in four or five years."
Several analysts said that in some ways the Microsoft-Compaq embrace was forced on them by other companies -- notably Apple Computer Inc., the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, Go Computing, and Motorola Inc. -- that appear to have taken the lead in certain areas, like pen-based computing and the emerging business of hand-held machines.
John McCarthy, who heads technology research at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., said that while Microsoft and Compaq have triumphed in the universe of computers powered by chips made by the Intel Corporation, future machines will be very different.
"The big winners and incumbents in the PC-space are scrambling to catch the next train before it leaves the station," Mr. McCarthy said.
Microsoft and Compaq worked closely when Compaq introduced a personal computer in 1987 based on Intel's first 386-series chip, and Microsoft created its best-selling Windows 386 software program around specifications developed by Compaq.
Mr. Gates and Eckhard Pfeiffer, the president and chief executive of Compaq, said they intended to create computing devices that were simple to use, and simple to expand or adapt to new equipment. They said that they hoped to accelerate demand for the devices by setting industry standards.
Mr. Pfeiffer said that in creating new standards, Compaq did not expect to reap huge rewards by accumulating patents or licenses that might discourage other companies from following its lead, and buying related Microsoft software products.
"It is certainly not the intent that we are going to throw rocks in each other's way," Mr. Pfeiffer said. "The goal, as Compaq has stated all along in its history, is to support an open industry standard."
Mr. Gates said it would be more efficient for Microsoft's software and marketing specialists to work with their counterparts at Compaq than for the companies to work on the same projects separately.
"Compaq has great depth in engineering," Mr. Gates said in an interview. "What we're looking for here is somebody who is close enough to the customers to know what things can be improved, what the opportunities are and the willingness to take risks with new types of product features."
Mr. Pfeiffer said that while Compaq had narrowed its product mix and introduced a new line of lower-priced machines, it eventually would have to broaden its products.
"No one has ever been able to stop the process and evolution of technology, not even I.B.M.," he said. "That is going to continue. Those who grab it and move ahead with it will determine the future in this industry. That's why we decided to join forces."
Compaq's stock slipped $1.375, to $50.875.

HEADLINE: State Urged To Rebuild L.I. Beaches

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 13

 BODY:
A task force appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo called today for the quick restoration at public expense of major Long Island beaches that suffered severe erosion during the winter's bruising storms.
In an interim report released today, the task force began the complicated process of setting limits on the public's responsibility for rebuilding beaches and structures that are vulnerable to routine battering by storms and the constant pounding of the wind and tide. 
 Though the Governor's Coastal Erosion Task Force will not make specific long-term policy recommendations until it releases its final report in June, the interim report provided indications of its direction: toward protecting and rebuilding beaches and structures in more densely settled areas.
For instance, the task force, which was appointed in January, said that major public beaches should be the first to receive state and Federal money.
The task force urged the Federal Army Corps of Engineers to speed up already approved projects to dredge sand from inlets and deposit it on beaches in Long Beach Island and at Robert Moses State Park.
 
Limiting State Responsibility
 But the task force suggested that the public should not be required to pay for beach protection projects on private property in sparsely settled areas, such as in parts of Fire Island. Consequently, the task force recommended that residents of Fair Harbor and Saltaire be allowed to build artificial dunes to prevent beach erosion, provided they pay for them.
The task force also recommended that 275 to 300 property owners, most on Fire Island and in Westhampton, not be allowed to rebuild severely damaged houses because they are likely to be wrecked again in future storms.
The 37-member task force's recommendations would have to be passed as legislation to become binding. But its report is significant, task force members said, because it is the beginning of an effort by the state to say that it should not be responsible for every change to its coastline.
"For a long time, people on the coast have considered themselves entitled to protection by public subsidy," said Thomas C. Jorling, the State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation and co-chairman of the task force. "This task force is starting to change that set of assumptions. We are saying that people who have built on these very dynamic areas, or want to build there in the future, are doing so at their own risk."
The interim report does not call for any major new projects. Instead, it endorses several projects that have been approved, such as a $12 million effort to close two large breaches of the barrier island at Westhampton Beach. Those breaches, which were created by a storm Dec. 11, could cause more erosion on other beaches and serious ecological damage to Moriches Bay. The work, which will be paid for by the state and Federal governments, is expected to begin in the coming weeks.
Citing the need to prepare for the summer vacation and hurricane seasons, the task force also urged the Army Corps of Engineers to speed up several beach restoration projects that have already been approved.
The Corps of Engineers has about $67.5 million in projects along Long Island's South Shore that are under way or about to begin. New York State pays 20 to 40 percent of the cost of those projects.
The Corps could not be reached for comment on whether it could accelerate the timetable for its Long Island projects. But the agency was represented on the task force, and several state officials said they expected the Corps to accept the recommendations.
The task force also endorsed a dredging project that began yesterday near Shinnecock Inlet to help prevent frequent flooding that blocks the road connecting a fisherman's cooperative to the mainland.
But the task force said that dredging is just a short-term solution, and that a permanent solution was necessary. That solution could include raising the road or moving the cooperative, task force members said.
Such specific long-term recommendations will be made in the final report. That report will include cost estimates for projects and recommendations on who should pay. It will also include recommendations for restoring and protecting the shorelines of New York City and Westchester.
The final report is expected to estabish a blueprint for the types of beach-erosion projects that New York State will recommend for Federal money. Task force members said they had sought to balance competing concerns over the environment and the economy. They noted that the barrier islands provide not only pristine beaches but also breeding grounds for wildlife and protection for the mainland.
"You can't do nothing because there is just too much at stake," said Kenneth Robinson, a task force member and an environmental lawyer on Long Island. "At the same time, you don't want to waste money."
Gail F. Shaffer, the Secretary of State and co-chairwoman of the task force, said: "The whole concept is to look at coastal erosion areas in a common sense way and say we aren't going to be able to contravene Mother Nature in everything that occurs. We have to make strategic decisions."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
An auction at a fallen agency is a reminder of the industry's modern perils

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
GEER, DUBOIS died in February, but the funeral, such as it is, is being held this morning. The agency's office in the Flatiron neighborhood of lower Manhattan will reopen a final time to sell its few tangible assets.
A public auction will offer computers, a telephone system and what a newspaper classified advertisement tersely called a "tremendous quantity very fine office furniture and equipment." 
 The sale is expected to raise only a couple hundred thousand dollars toward the estimated $4 million to $5 million in debts left when the agency, known for stylishly creative campaigns for products including Baileys Original Irish Cream liqueur and Jaguar cars, abruptly collapsed two months ago, throwing 55 people out of work.
The shop traced its history to a public relations agency founded by the owner Peter Geer's parents in 1935. But its sudden end more than half a century later offers a cautionary tale at a perilous time in the advertising industry.
"It isn't just another agency that failed to make it," said Doria Steedman, an 18-year employee who left before top executives decided on liquidation. "It was special; we walked taller and were prouder."
What crippled the agency, asserted Ms. Steedman, now an executive vice president at the Partnership for a Drug-Free America in New York, was that it "never moved from the 70's into the 90's" and failed to adapt to advertising's new realities. For instance, as Adweek noted in an article, "Death of an Agency," at a time when most agencies had cut back to staffing levels of one person for each $1 million in billings, Geer, DuBois at one point had 250 employees for its $120 million in billings.
Stephen G. Bowen Jr., who joined the agency in March 1992 as president and chief executive, said that agencies can no longer fool themselves into believing "that if the numbers don't look strong, next year will be better than this year."
"Frankly, the agency business in the last 30 years has been a go-go business," added Mr. Bowen, who is still thinking about what to do next in the wake of Geer, DuBois's closing. Given the industry's current "significant prolonged downturn," he continued, "if you have major account losses, you're dead -- and that's precisely what happened to Geer, DuBois."
Two months before Mr. Bowen arrived at the agency, its second-largest client, Brown & Williamson Tobacco, withdrew its estimated $30 million in billings. And not long after, Jaguar Cars Inc. took its estimated $20 million account to Ogilvy & Mather New York. The final blow was struck by the Paddington Corporation, which markets Baileys and other spirits brands; its decision to consolidate accounts at two other agencies meant Geer, DuBois would lose its largest remaining client and $13 million to $15 million in billings.
"The problems there were worse than I realized," Mr. Bowen said. "To keep the doors open without Paddington, I would have had to risk $2 million of personal money." So Mr. Geer and his lawyers decided to cease operations under a provision of New York State law known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
"I never believed it would go under," said Rodney Underwood, chairman and creative director, adding that after he turned down "three separate opportunities" to join other agencies during the final year, a friend told him " 'You're either a saint or an idiot.' "
"I don't think I was either one," Mr. Underwood continued, "but in the end I think I did the right thing." He and about 6 to 12 former Geer, DuBois colleagues are working out of an office at TBWA Advertising, completing work on campaigns for Geer, DuBois's last clients, which include the New York Zoological Society, the Northrop Corporation and Meridien Hotels.
Jerold R. Ruderman, a lawyer in White Plains who was assigned by the New York State Supreme Court to handle the Geer, DuBois liquidation, said that the 750 to 1,000 claims that he expected creditors to file were "massively in excess of the amount of money we will be taking in."
"It's kind of sad when you go down there," he added, referring to his visits to confer with Jackson Hecht Associates, the auctioneers preparing the former agency quarters on the 16th and 17th floors of 114 Fifth Avenue, between 16th and 17th Streets, for today's sale, which begins at 10:30 A.M.
Ms. Steedman said that she was "toying with attending the auction."
"Half of me wants to go and say goodbye," she added. "The other half says 'What the hell for?' "

Weak Retail Sales Report Causes Decline in the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined against most major foreign currencies in worldwide trading yesterday, driven lower by a weak United States retail sales report. But the dollar steadied against the Japanese yen.
Gold edged higher in New York after falling modestly in Europe and Asia. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery gained 70 cents a troy ounce to settle at $337.70. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $336.95 an ounce, up 45 cents from Monday. 
 Activity in the foreign exchange market in New York picked up from the slow pace of the Good Friday holiday. Many markets were closed Friday and Monday.
Dealers sold dollars in response to news that retail sales plunged 1 percent in March. The Commerce Department report raised doubts about the recovery's durability. Continuing economic weakness could cause interest rates to fall further, making the dollar a less attractive investment.
But heavy sales of the dollar in favor of the yen appeared to subside. Traders expect the dollar and yen to trade in a narrow range this week pending news from the meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan in Washington. The leaders are expected to discuss the economic stimulus package introduced in Tokyo, which has elements intended to help Japan trim its huge trade surplus with the United States.
A meeting of major industrialized countries over the weekend is also expected to yield some news on the yen-dollar relationship. The United States and other trading partners of Japan have advocated a stronger yen to combat trade imbalances.
The dollar closed in Tokyo at 113.33 yen, up 0.38 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 113.20 yen. In New York, the dollar finished the day at 113.40 yen, up from 112.80 yen late Monday.
The British pound rose to $1.5591 in London from $1.5251 late Thursday. Later in New York, sterling strengthened to $1.5580 from $1.5460 late Monday.
Late dollar rates in New York compared with Monday's late quotes included: 1.5820 German marks, down from 1.5945; 1.4475 Swiss francs, down from 1.4645

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
General Electric Co. (N)

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said yesterday that profits rose 9.6 percent in the first quarter, led by a strong performance at its financial unit, GE Capital Services. The unit's net income was up 22 percent in the quarter, compared with a year ago.
John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman, cited double-digit earnings gains in six of the company's 12 businesses -- NBC, appliances, locomotives, motors, power systems and plastics. But pretax profits were sharply lower in the aircraft engines unit. The drop was attributed to product-development costs and a charge for previously announced layoffs as orders dried up from airlines. 
 Analysts said the earnings exceeded estimates. "The productivity gains that G.E. has talked about are surfacing in the numbers," Mark Altman at Paine Webber Securities said. "It was a solid quarter."
G.E. said it continued to squeeze inventories and shorten development time in getting new products to customers. The appliance unit, for example, cut average inventories on hand by $400 million, Bruce Bunche, a spokesman, said.
Strong orders in March helped raise operating margins to 12 percent from 11.5 percent the year before as the American economy picked up, although some European businesses were weak. Lower programming and overhead costs in broadcasting and Super Bowl advertising helped NBC's results.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fell Sharply In March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
Consumers cut spending at retail counters by 1 percent in March, the biggest monthly decline in more than two years, the Commerce Department said today in a report that was considerably weaker than expected.
Although the midmonth blizzard that paralyzed much of the Northeast and South was widely acknowledged to have had an adverse impact, Government and private analysts said there was little doubt that the poor sales results also suggested a further slackening of economic growth. 
 Today's report also included a revision for February sales; a month ago, the department estimated they had risen by three-tenths of 1 percent, but today it said they had declined by that much.
"This is a rather disturbing report," Donald H. Straszheim, a top economist at Merrill Lynch, said, adding that the widespread nature of the declines indicated that the drop could not be entirely attributed to foul weather. Analysts had generally expected retail sales to remain unchanged for March after allowing for the usual seasonal and holiday variations.
The Clinton Administration pounced on the data to argue the urgency of its $16.3 billion economic stimulus package, bogged down in the Senate by Republican opposition.
The sales report, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown contended, "provides compelling evidence that recovery is at risk unless decisive action is taken when Congress returns next week."
Mr. Brown pointed out that retail sales, which account for one-third of economic activity, had not fallen for two straight months in almost two years and that sales, at a seasonally adjusted $166.9 billion in March, have slipped back to the lowest level since September.
Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, responded by accusing the Administration of a "snow job" in seeking to persuade the public that a weather-related sales decline could be dealt with through additional Government spending.
"If anything, consumers are getting more and more worried about being buried under a record-breaking blizzard of new taxes," Senator Dole said.
The retail sales report was the latest in a growing list of disappointing indicators on the economy. For example, income growth has largely disappeared, consumer confidence in the economy has fallen and the job market remains sluggish. Some analysts now think that first-quarter growth of gross domestic product, to be initially estimated by the Commerce Department on April 29, will be less than half the 4.7 percent annual pace recorded for the final three months of 1992.
"There has been a significant slowdown in the pace of recovery -- and that is troubling," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chief economic adviser to President Clinton, whose own G.D.P. estimate is "a little short of 3" percent for the quarter ended in March.
Today's report had scarcely any bright spots, private analysts said. Both long-lasting goods and nondurables posted hefty sales declines, and the 1 percent overall decline would have been even worse -- 1.2 percent -- had the sales decline at automotive dealers, which was four-tenths of 1 percent, been excluded.
Elsewhere in durable-goods sales, which were down nine-tenths of 1 percent, merchants selling furniture and other equipment for the home suffered a 2.3 percent decline while those selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes saw volume shrink 1.7 percent.
 
Drops in Most Nondurables
 Among nondurables sales, which were 1.1 percent lower than in February, there were falls of 1.8 percent for general merchandise stores and for gasoline service stations; falls of 1.6 percent for food stores and apparel outlets, and a six-tenths of 1 percent decline at restaurants and bars.
Drug and proprietary stores, however, posted a gain of five-tenths of 1 percent.
Some, but far from all, of the sales lost to severe weather will likely be recouped, analysts said. Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, the largest trade group for the industry, noted that last month's sales were still 4.4 percent ahead of the March 1992 level. She said she was confident of improved sales this spring and summer.

A Bush Admiral Tells Why He Helped Clinton

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

The Line of Fire
From Washington to the Gulf, the Politics and Battles of the New Military
By Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. with David Chanoff.
Illustrated. 367 pages. Simon & Schuster. $25.
From midshipman to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the career of Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. spanned the cold war and included a few of the hot ones. Yet after the admiral's 47 years of military service, the present generation probably remembers him best as the retired admiral who served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush at the Pentagon, then broke ranks and came out for Gov. Bill Clinton in last year's Presidential contest. 
 His autobiography, "The Line of Fire," written with David Chanoff, is not outspoken about the Commanders in Chief he worked for. (By being discreet, he may be making a silent statement of faint praise.) He does, however, call Dan Quayle "a creditable Vice President" but does not say why. By contrast, he is candid on his judgment of Mr. Clinton and why he decided to become his military adviser during the campaign.
"While I had had some occasional disagreements with the Bush Administration on specific national security issues (particularly the plan to abandon sanctions against Iraq and rush to military action before laying out long-term regional objectives)," he writes, "on the whole I was more than satisfied with the direction it had taken."
Once out of uniform, Admiral Crowe, who has a doctorate in politics from Princeton and is professor of geopolitics at the University of Oklahoma, found himself thinking more and more about the nation's economic and social problems. He writes:
"I was dismayed by our lack of a sensible industrial policy, by our educational failings and by the terrible divisiveness isolating so many citizens from the great American community that makes us a people rather than an assortment of factions. I found myself increasingly disturbed by the Republican Party's tendency to exclude certain groups from the mainstream of American life and exploit antagonisms within the society. It seemed to me that our economic and industrial deterioration had replaced superpower confrontation as the greatest threat to our national security."
In this respect, Admiral Crowe's position echoes what the independent Center for Defense Information, founded by Rear Adm. Gene R. La Rocque, retired, has been advocating in its publication, The Defense Monitor, for two decades: strong social, economic, political and military components and a healthy environment all contribute to American security.
Admiral Crowe was the senior adviser to the South Vietnamese Riverine Force in the Vietnam War. In one of the boldest statements in "The Line of Fire," he now writes that Vietnam was "a war in which neither America's survival nor its future was at stake." He deplored what he calls the Republican effort to shift the country's attention away from its pressing problems with "peripheral concerns, such as Bill Clinton's leanings during the Vietnam War some 25 years earlier."
So he decided to get involved in a political race for the first time. He writes that Governor Clinton struck him as the candidate best able to shake off "the inertia of cold war habits" and address the challenges of a vastly different world. During military briefings, he says, he found that Governor Clinton had a powerful and retentive mind and that contrary to some views, he was not antimilitary. As he got to know him more intimately during the campaign, he said, he found Governor Clinton's feeling for people obviously genuine: "I would call him a humanist."
Disappointingly, Admiral Crowe ducks any comment on the current ethnic, religious, political and historical war in the Balkans. He doesn't discuss what role, if any, he and high-ranking Pentagon officers think the United States should play there. His views about the new-old Balkan tinderbox would be valuable. As chairman of President Clinton's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the author obviously knows a great deal more than he is willing to commit to paper about that volatile situation.
The most revealing sections in "The Line of Fire" concern Admiral Crowe's encounters with his Russian counterpart, Marshall Sergei F. Akhromeyev, who was Chief of Staff of the Soviet armed forces under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The gruff Soviet World War II commander and the polished American admiral and their wives became good friends. Both men had seen enough of shooting wars and sought treaties to avoid a nuclear conflict.
On his own, Admiral Crowe decided to open a military-to-military dialogue with the Soviets. Ignoring some official opposition, he showed Marshall Akhromeyev the Pentagon's nerve center and the latest American aircraft carrier, followed by a warm visit to Oklahoma, Admiral Crowe's home state. Thereafter, Admiral Crowe inspected Soviet military installations. Later, disillusioned with the state of affairs in the former Soviet Union, Marshall Akhromeyev killed himself. "I admired him," Admiral Crowe writes. "He was a significant figure in creating the breakthrough that ended the cold war. But like Gorbachev himself, he never had in mind the final denouement."
Admiral Crowe rightfully considers the American-Soviet military exchanges that he initiated to be his major contribution to spiking the guns; his inside details make for interesting reading. In "The Line of Fire," he emerges as an admirable diplomat in uniform, a peacetime warrior in the Pentagon.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Plan Is Afoot to Shift OTB Regulation

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
The chairman of the commission looking into the future of racing in New York State said yesterday that the group was concentrating on a plan to put racing in the hands of a corporation, a regulated monopoly that would also run offtrack betting in New York City, but not elsewhere in the state, at least for a while.
"We would hope that the others would eventually come aboard," said Vincent Tese, who heads the nine-member Advisory Commission on Racing in the 21st Century. It was appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last fall to look into a possible restructuring of racing after the year 2000, when the New York Racing Association's franchise to operate the state's three major tracks expires. 
 Since then, the N.Y.R.A., a private, nonprofit group that has been sharply criticized by the Governor, has put forth its own plan to absorb the state's six regional offtrack betting corporations.
 
Report Is Due June 1
 Tese, who also serves as the state's director of economic development, stressed that he was speaking only for himself. The commission's report is due June 1, and Tese suggested that the plan he outlined would meet the key political reality test, acceptance by the Governor and the New York State Legislature.
He said, for example, that the five offtrack betting operations outside New York City would most likely not be included in the plan simply because they had been so outspokenly hostile to a merger and had the political clout to block one.
As outlined by Tese, under the "very, very preliminary plan" being considered by the commission, a publicly owned corporation would eventually take over the operations of the tracks and the New York City Offtrack Betting Corporation, but only after a transition arrangement of two or three years.
During the transition, a restructured N.Y.R.A. would run both the tracks and the city's offtrack betting operations.
 
Questions Are Raised
 Tese did not say how the N.Y.R.A. would be restructured, and the two-stage plan raises a double-edged question: Why could a revamped association be expected to do any better than the original, and if it could, why would it not simply continue to run the operation?
For one thing, Tese suggested, the combination of racing and offtrack betting, which has wide support, would give the transition group the resources it needs to improve.
Selling the operations to private investors, once the transition management has enhanced racing's value, would mean windfalls for both the state and city.

Uniquely Perilous

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
Life over the course of the last half-century has been confusing for those people who manufacture and sell cigarettes. Their product went from being an accepted part of daily life to a suspected carcinogen to the most reviled legal substance in America.
But now their position should be quite clear. Tobacco companies fall into a separate and distinct category of business because they produce and market a product that has no redeeming value and that causes serious illness and death. 
 Five years ago, when the American Bar Association considered -- and rejected -- a proposal that it endorse a ban on all tobacco advertising, one member described cigarettes as "uniquely perilous." Our national policies should reflect that: not just our health policies, but our fiscal policies as well.
One of the most interesting of these is the plan to cut or entirely eliminate the tax deductions tobacco companies receive for the cost of their advertising. Senator Tom Harkin, who wants to cut the deductions and use the revenues for both deficit reduction and counteradvertising, says that taxpayers are unaware that such deductions even exist. But the fact is that cigarette companies spend billions of dollars each year to advertise and promote their products, and take a huge deduction for those costs.
Tobacco company executives insist they use advertising only to get smokers to switch from one brand to another and not to snag new younger consumers to replace those who have died untimely deaths. Of course, these are the same people who not so long ago wanted you to believe that there was no link between lung disease and smoking. Veracity is not their brand name.
But they are savvy, and in the debate about tobacco advertising they push a genuine American hot button, that of free speech. The tobacco companies even have the American Civil Liberties Union on their side. (It should be noted that the A.C.L.U. has accepted contributions from cigarette manufacturers, which the organization insists has no bearing on this issue.)
Ira Glasser, the A.C.L.U.'s executive director, says it's simply wrong to provide business deductions for some businesses but to exempt others because you do not like the product. "You can't pick and choose," he says. "You can't make a distinction based on what is produced."
Sure you can. Government is in the business of making distinctions, between the income taxes paid by those who earn $30,000 a year and those who earn $300,000, between how a company can dispose of garbage and how it can dispose of toxic wastes. By instituting so-called sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco, it surely makes a distinction between products it considers dangerous luxuries and all others.
Mr. Glasser says that this is a slippery slope, that red meat and eggs could be next. But you can argue that those foods have clear benefits if eaten in moderation. No one argues that there is any benefit to tobacco use except to the tobacco companies, who are among the most profitable industries in America.
In recent years members of the Senate have voted down proposals to eliminate tax deductions for cigarette advertising costs, often invoking the free speech argument. But the cause is more likely the millions of dollars tobacco companies give in political contributions. "They have a right to free speech," says Senator Bill Bradley, who has led efforts to eliminate deductions for cigarette advertising. "They do not have a constitutional right to a tax deduction."
So many of our antismoking efforts have focused on the individual consumers, proposing taxes on their single packs while the companies grow ever richer. Restaurant sections, smoke-free offices, sin taxes -- they've all focused on the little guy. That's always easier than taking on the corporations.
Sure, smokers have made personal choices. And they pay for those choices every day, whether sitting through an airline flight dying for a smoke, or dying for a smoke in the oncology wing of a hospital. The tobacco companies have not paid nearly enough for the killing, and that is because we have too often treated them like everyone else. Their product is "uniquely perilous" and should be given unique stature -- or lack of same.

HEADLINE: U.S. Shouldn't Export Mineral Industry Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your April 1 editorial support for the proposal by the Clinton Administration and Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt to charge a 12.5 percent royalty on the gross income of the mineral producers from Federal lands is terribly simplistic. Unlike oil, which can be processed into a salable commodity at little cost, hard-rock minerals have little value until after expensive smelting. 
 While some additional Federal royalty based on net profits may be rational, a royalty based on gross value will only make American minerals noncompetitive in international markets. The result will be closed mines and far more revenue losses from decreased corporate income-tax payments, higher unemployment payouts and reduced machinery orders, rather than revenue gains.
A royalty that ignores the exceptional costs of finding minerals and then producing them in an environmentally sound manner, will cost -- not make -- money. And from a global perspective, it will do the world's environment no good if we drive domestic mineral producers out of business and then import our minerals from countries that observe weak environmental laws. We'll only export jobs and worsen our ailing balance-of-payments deficit.
The royalty proposal seems penny wise and pound foolish. That may be why the Clinton Administration has had second thoughts and has withdrawn its royalty proposal from its initial budget. Perhaps you should take this cue and also reconsider your position.

HEADLINE: U.S. Shouldn't Export Mineral Industry Jobs;
Green Effetists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Clinton the Conservationist Thinks Twice" (The Week in Review, April 4) incorrectly refers to the hard-rock mining industry as Government subsidized. This is far from the truth. The reality is as follows: 
 * Hard-rock miners and prospec
tors pay $5 an acre annual rental for mining claims on Federal lands.
* Hard-rock claims require payment of additional annual fees to the Bureau of Land Management to cover administrative costs.
* Mining and minerals exploration companies and their employees pay billions of tax dollars annually to Federal and local governments.
Hard-rock mining of the rural West is not a mendicant claw preying on taxpayers, as it is portrayed by green effetists from overpopulated coastal areas. It is rather the economic base for our domestic agriculture and manufacturing industries, from which other businesses are generated (including yours: without the addition of specialty clays and other minerals mined from the earth, the consistency of newsprint paper would be very different).
The opponents to hard-rock mining, predominantly the wilderness preservationist industry, contribute little to Federal coffers by their land use. Wilderness areas, vast tracts of Federal lands withdrawn from development, cost taxpayers $30 for every $1 they generate. These are subsidized recreation for a minority of ennui-motivated affluent urbanites, whose intellectual base is reminiscent of the "Red" sympathizers of the 1920's.
It's time for these freeloaders to pony up a substantial ante to the Federal coffers if they want to use Federal lands. When the wilderness industry can generate revenues on a par with the extractive industries, its land use parity can merit serious consideration.

HEADLINE: Winners of the 1993 Pulitzer Prizes for Journalism, Literature and the Arts

 BODY:
GENERAL NONFICTION
Garry Wills
"Lincoln at Gettysburg:
The Words That Remade America"
In "Lincoln at Gettysburg," a scholarly study of oratory, Garry Wills argues that Abraham Lincoln, in the mere 272 words of the Gettysburg Address, was able to recast the tradition of oration, the Civil War, and the history of American political thought in a new and clearer light. In offering new ideas about the structure and context of the speech, Mr. Wills maintains that Lincoln used his words to win the war in ideological as well as military terms. The 58-year-old Mr. Wills, a classical scholar, Presidential historian and political scientist, is an adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., where he lives.
 
FICTION
Robert Olen Butler
"A Good Scent
From a Strange Mountain"
In Robert Olen Butler's first collection of short stories, "A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain," each of the 15 intricate tales is told in the first person, from the viewpoint of different Vietnamese transplanted from the Mekong Delta to the Louisiana bayou. Haunted by the past, and highly ambivalent about their American hosts, these fictional immigrants seek truces in their various personal wars, and their stories raise the literature of the Vietnam conflict to an original and highly personal new level. Mr. Butler, 48, served as an Army linguist in Vietnam, which was the setting for three of his six previous novels. His first novel to be published, "The Alleys of Eden," was printed by Horizon Press after the manuscript was turned down 21 times. Mr. Butler teaches fiction writing and film theory at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, La. 

POETRY
Louise Gluck
"The Wild Iris"
Louise Gluck's sixth poetry collection is a sequence of poems on the ordeal of living, explored through the metaphor of the garden, which encompasses the natural, human and spiritual realms. In her earliest collections, "Firstborn," "The House on Marshland" and "Descending Figure," Ms. Gluck (pronounced Glick) established herself as a questioning voice speaking in a tightly controlled, polished language. Hers was the speech, said one critic, that one employs before starting to scream. Ms. Gluck lives in Plainfield, Vt., and teaches at Williams College.
 
BIOGRAPHY
David McCullough
"Truman"
David McCullough's warm, affectionate personal study examined the President whose forthright style made him an icon for both Republicans and Democrats in the last Presidential election. Mr. McCullough made no secret of his admiration for the man he called "a figure of world stature, both a great and good man, and a great American President." Mr. McCullough, who lives in West Tisbury, Mass., also serves as host for the PBS series "The American Experience" and narrated the documentary series "The Civil War."
 
DRAMA
Tony Kushner
"Angels in America:
Millennium Approaches"
For Mr. Kushner, a 36-year-old playwright who lives in Brooklyn, the award is as timely as can be. His winning play had its first preview last night at the Walter Kerr Theater on Broadway, where it is scheduled to open on April 29. "Angels in America: Millennium Approaches" is a strident, vividly theatrical piece on homosexual themes. Set largely in New York in the mid-1980's, it uses fictional characters, historical personages, ghosts, hallucinations, disembodied voices and an actual angel to place the AIDS epidemic as the central symbol of the nation's spiritual hypocrisy.
Mr. Kushner actually won for half a play. "Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes" is, all told, a 7-hour epic divided into two parts: "Millennium Approaches" and "Perestroika." Part 1 has been mounted at the Eureka Theater in San Francisco and the Royal National Theater in London, and both parts were performed last fall at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Mr. Kushner is now rewriting "Perestroika," and the plan is to put it in repertory with "Millennium Approaches" on Broadway in the fall.
 
HISTORY
Gordon S. Wood
"The Radicalism
Of the American Revolution"
It was not as bloody or destructive as most, but if the American Revolution is measured by the standard of the degree of social change it produced, then it was "as radical and as revolutionary as any in history." So wrote Mr. Wood, 59, a professor of history at Brown University, in this landmark study. In a front-page review for the New York Times Sunday Book Review last year, another specialist in early American history called Mr. Wood's work "the most important study of the Revolution to appear in over 20 years."
 
MUSIC
Christopher Rouse
Trombone Concerto
Christopher Rouse, a 44-year-old composer who lives in Fairport, N.Y., won for his Trombone Concerto, a three-movement work that was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and given its premiere by the orchestra and its principal trombonist, Joseph Alessi, on Dec. 29. Like many of his works, the Trombone Concerto has currents of both despair and celebration: slow, mournful outer movements surround a loud, colorfully virtuosic middle section. Reviewing its premiere in The New York Times, Edward Rothstein described it as "distinctive, unsettling, yet structurally clear."
 
PUBLIC SERVICE
The Miami Herald
When Hurricane Andrew pummeled the Miami area last August, laying waste to entire communities and leaving 50,000 southern Dade County residents homeless, the newsroom staff of The Miami Herald found itself in the middle of the story. Dozens of editors and reporters were among those who lost homes in the storm, the costliest natural disaster in American history. In December, The Herald published an 18-page special section, "What Went Wrong?" which concluded, among other things, that lax building codes had worsened the scope of the devastation.
Pete Weitzel, the Herald's senior managing editor, said he believed the newspaper's most important work may have come in the days after the storm, when it published basic survival information and provided a column for residents looking for friends and relatives with whom they had lost contact. "I think the greatest public service was in providing people with all that kind of information that the traditional journalist would say is average, everyday stuff," he said. "It's all the necessities of life."
 
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING
Jeff Brazil and Steve Berry
The Orlando Sentinel
Jeff Brazil and Steve Berry reported that the Volusia County (Fla.) Sheriff had seized $8 million in cash from motorists on Interstate 95 as part of a anti-drug effort. Ninety percent of those whose money was confiscated were black or Hispanic drivers stopped for minor traffic violations. A governor's task force is investigating the sheriff's squad. Mr. Berry, 45, has a master's degree in history from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Mr. Brazil, 31, graduated from the University of Santa Clara in California.
 
SPOT NEWS REPORTING
The Los Angeles Times
For what the Pulitzer board described as its "balanced, comprehensive, penetrating coverage" of the second day of the riots in South Central Los Angeles, the staff of The Los Angeles Times was awarded the prize for spot news reporting. The stories, covering the second day of the rioting that swept the city after four policeman were acquitted of beating Rodney G. King, a black motorist, varied from the revenge beating of Reginald O. Denny, a white truck driver, to the ways in which everyday life in the city were shattered by the violence.
C. Shelby Coffey 3d, The Times's editor, compared the mobilization of the newsroom for the riots to the paper's coverage of the war in the Persian Gulf, except that "this was literally right in our backyard." The story was in the paper's front yard, too: on the first night of the violence, rioters attacked the Times building in downtown Los Angeles, causing about $500,000 in damage.
 
INTERNATIONAL REPORTING
John F. Burns of The New York Times
Roy Gutman of Newsday
Two Pulitzer Prizes were awarded for international reporting, both to veteran foreign correspondents for their coverage of the violent conflict and human suffering in the Balkans. John F. Burns of The New York Times was cited for his "courageous and thorough coverage of the destruction of Sarajevo and the barbarous killings in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina." He began his assignment in the region in early 1992 after months of treatment for lymphoma. In one 275-day period he wrote 163 articles, 103 datelined from the perilous city of Sarajevo. Roy W. Gutman of Newsday was cited for his "courageous and persistent reporting that disclosed atrocities and other human rights violations in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina." His articles included the first lengthy account of what Newsday described as death camps in Bosnia. Mr. Burns, 48, a native of Nottingham, England, joined The Times in 1975. Mr. Gutman, 49, joined Newsday in 1982.
 
NATIONAL REPORTING
David Maraniss
The Washington Post
The life and political record of Bill Clinton were the subject of the series of articles that won the national reporting prize for David Maraniss of The Washington Post. Mr. Maraniss, 43, said of Mr. Clinton: "He's deeply complex, both a representative and unique figure of his generation. He is endlessly fascinating." Working for newspapers runs in the Maraniss family: he is the grandson of a printer and the son of two editors.
 
BEAT REPORTING
Paul Ingrassia and Joseph B. White
The Wall Street Journal
In their coverage of the tumultuous management changes in 1992 at the General Motors Corporation, in which a former chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Stemple, was forced from office, Paul Ingrassia and Joseph B. White of The Wall Street Journal provided an unusually detailed account of the inner workings of a corporate board of directors. "This was a board at the cutting edge of corporate governance activism," said Mr. Ingrassia. "It rose up against management." Mr. Ingrassia, 42, a Mississippi native, received a master's degree in journalism from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Mr. White, 34, who was born in New York City, graduated from Harvard University.
 
FEATURE WRITING
George Lardner Jr.
The Washington Post
George Lardner Jr. won for an investigation of the murder of his own daughter by a former boyfriend. While journalists are often reluctant to write about a subject to which they have a personal tie, Mr. Lardner brought a powerful sense of urgency to his analysis of faults in the criminal justice system. Mr. Lardner, 58, said yesterday that winning a Pulitzer Prize for such a topic was bittersweet: "I'm stunned, elated and sad all at once." Mr. Lardner, whose great-uncle, Ring Lardner, was also an author and journalist, has been a reporter and columnist at The Post since 1963. He graduated from Marquette University.
 
COMMENTARY
Liz Balmaseda
The Miami Herald
Liz Balmaseda was cited for her articles from Haiti on the deteriorating political and social conditions there, and for her columns on the lives of Cuban-Americans in Miami. The 34-year-old journalist was born in Cuba 17 days after Castro took power in the 1959 revolution and left with her family for Miami at the age of 10 months. She said yesterday: "I try with the column to reflect the real Miami. It is ever-changing, multi-ethnic and multi-racial. I also want to show the Cuban exile community to be the politically and culturally diverse community that it is."
 
EXPLANATORY JOURNALISM
Mike Toner
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
Mr. Toner's series, "When Bugs Bite Back," had its roots in a five-year-old Federal report on drug-resistant strains of venereal disease. "We began thinking about how 'Better Living Through Chemistry' has changed our lives and the world in ways that give us pause," said Mr. Toner's editor, Mike King. The result was 15 articles that explored the dimishing effectiveness and the overuse of antibiotics and pesticides.Mr. Toner, 48, is a graduate of the University of Iowa and received a master's degree from Northwestern University.
 
CRITICISM
Michael Dirda
The Washington Post
Michael Dirda, who describes himself as "a writer and appreciator of books," won for his book reviews, covering a wide variety of subjects, including biblical studies, children's literature, thrillers and translations of the classics. For the past 15 years, Mr. Dirda, 44, has been an assistant editor and writer for The Washington Post Book World. Until recently he was a board member of the National Book Critics Circle. Son of a steelworker, he grew up in the steel town of Lorain, Ohio. He says of his literary criticism: "I like to convey my enthusiasm for reading and remind people how good the classics are."
 
EDITORIAL WRITING

EDITORIAL CARTOONING
Stephen R. Benson
The Arizona Republic
Stephen R. Benson says he believes that editorial cartoons "should take a point of view and be acidic, passionate and hard-hitting." He won for his work on a wide spectrum of themes, including starvation in Somalia and the United States economy. Mr. Benson, a 39-year-old graduate of Brigham Young University, has been editorial cartoonist at The Republic for 11 years. "It's better than sitting there and screaming at Peter Jennings on television," he said.

Two graduates of the Rochester Institute of Technology, William Snyder and Ken Geiger of The Dallas Morning News, won the spot news photography award for images of the Summer Olympics in Barcelona. It was the third Pulitzer for Mr. Snyder, 33, who began his photography career at age 14 shooting football games for his hometown newspaper in Henderson, Ky. Mr. Geiger, a 35-year-old native of Bremerton, Wash., became a photojournalist because job prospects seemed dim in forestry, which he had planned to study in college.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the Pulitzer Prizes, and a picture caption in some copies, misidentified the category for which The Dallas Morning News won. It was spot news photography, not feature photography. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the title of a series of reports in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, honored for explanatory journalism. It was "When Bugs Fight Back."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Times Co. Reports Income of $10.9 Million

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The New York Times Company yesterday reported first-quarter net income of $10.9 million, or 14 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $20 million, a year ago. But after adjustments for accounting changes and special items, the company said earnings were 16 cents a share in both quarters.
Revenue for the 1993 quarter rose to $454.5 million from $435.9 million for the first quarter of 1992. 
 The results fell a bit short of analysts' expectations. Many had predicted that the company would earn 17 cents a share. The company said that delivery problems caused by the Eastern blizzard in mid-March cost $3.7 million -- 2 cents a share -- because of advertising and circulation adjustments.
 Kevin R. Gruneich, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation, said that he expected the company's results to rise because of the improving economy and operational savings at The Times's new printing plant in Edison, N.J., which opened in September.
 
Circulation Rises
 Profit for the Newspaper Group, which includes The New York Times, 31 regional newspapers and a half-interest in The International Herald Tribune, declined to $28.6 million, on revenue of $339.4 million, from $32.7 million, on revenue of $319.7 million. Advertising linage at The New York Times was down 4.8 percent.
For the quarter, The Times reported a record average weekday circulation of 1,229,100 copies, an increase of 32,900 over the first quarter of 1992. Sunday circulation rose to 1,812,500 copies, a record, and an increase of 39,500 from the comparable period.
Circulation at the company's regional newspapers rose slightly, to a record 904,200 copies on weekdays and 907,600 on Sundays. Advertising for the group was up 6.2 percent, primarily because of increases from advertising inserts.
The Magazine Group reported improved performance, with a quarterly profit of $3.2 million on revenue of $95 million, up from a profit of $1.7 million on revenue of $97.8 million last year. The company attributed this to higher ad rates and the timing of promotional expenses.
Broadcast operations showed improved operating profit for the quarter, reporting $3.6 million on revenue of $20.1 million, compared with profit of $2.8 million on revenue of $18.5 million for the 1992 quarter.
The Forest Products Group reported a larger after-tax loss of $2.1 million, compared with a loss of $1.6 million in the 1992 quarter.
Interest expenses declined to $5.2 million in the first quarter of 1993, from $7.0 million last year, mainly because of reduced borrowing.
In trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, the price of the Times Company's class A shares declined 12.5 cents, to $30.75.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about The New York Times Company's first-quarter earnings misstated the latest reporting period for The Times's circulation. It was the six months ended March 31, 1993, not the quarter.

The latest first quarter included a pretax charge of $3.7 million for the March blizzard that affected delivery of The New York Times and required adjustment of certain advertising and circulation rates.
The year-ago quarter included a pretax gain of $1.5 million, or 1 cent a share, on the sale of real estate, and a pretax gain of $1.6 million, or 1 cent a share, on the sale of a corporate asset. The period also included an operating loss of $1.7 million pretax, at The Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News, which was closed in September 1992.
Equity in operations of Forest Products Group was a loss of $2,142,000 for the latest first quarter, compared with a loss of $1,619,000 for year-ago period.

 BODY:
GENERAL NONFICTION
Garry Wills
"Lincoln at Gettysburg:
The Words That Remade America"
In "Lincoln at Gettysburg," a scholarly study of oratory, Garry Wills argues that Abraham Lincoln, in the mere 272 words of the Gettysburg Address, was able to recast the tradition of oration, the Civil War, and the history of American political thought in a new and clearer light. In offering new ideas about the structure and context of the speech, Mr. Wills maintains that Lincoln used his words to win the war in ideological as well as military terms. The 58-year-old Mr. Wills, a classical scholar, Presidential historian and political scientist, is an adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., where he lives.
 
FICTION
Robert Olen Butler
"A Good Scent
From a Strange Mountain"
In Robert Olen Butler's first collection of short stories, "A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain," each of the 15 intricate tales is told in the first person, from the viewpoint of different Vietnamese transplanted from the Mekong Delta to the Louisiana bayou. Haunted by the past, and highly ambivalent about their American hosts, these fictional immigrants seek truces in their various personal wars, and their stories raise the literature of the Vietnam conflict to an original and highly personal new level. Mr. Butler, 48, served as an Army linguist in Vietnam, which was the setting for three of his six previous novels. His first novel to be published, "The Alleys of Eden," was printed by Horizon Press after the manuscript was turned down 21 times. Mr. Butler teaches fiction writing and film theory at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, La. 

POETRY
Louise Gluck
"The Wild Iris"
Louise Gluck's sixth poetry collection is a sequence of poems on the ordeal of living, explored through the metaphor of the garden, which encompasses the natural, human and spiritual realms. In her earliest collections, "Firstborn," "The House on Marshland" and "Descending Figure," Ms. Gluck (pronounced Glick) established herself as a questioning voice speaking in a tightly controlled, polished language. Hers was the speech, said one critic, that one employs before starting to scream. Ms. Gluck lives in Plainfield, Vt., and teaches at Williams College.
 
BIOGRAPHY
David McCullough
"Truman"
David McCullough's warm, affectionate personal study examined the President whose forthright style made him an icon for both Republicans and Democrats in the last Presidential election. Mr. McCullough made no secret of his admiration for the man he called "a figure of world stature, both a great and good man, and a great American President." Mr. McCullough, who lives in West Tisbury, Mass., also serves as host for the PBS series "The American Experience" and narrated the documentary series "The Civil War."
 
DRAMA
Tony Kushner
"Angels in America:
Millennium Approaches"
For Mr. Kushner, a 36-year-old playwright who lives in Brooklyn, the award is as timely as can be. His winning play had its first preview last night at the Walter Kerr Theater on Broadway, where it is scheduled to open on April 29. "Angels in America: Millennium Approaches" is a strident, vividly theatrical piece on homosexual themes. Set largely in New York in the mid-1980's, it uses fictional characters, historical personages, ghosts, hallucinations, disembodied voices and an actual angel to place the AIDS epidemic as the central symbol of the nation's spiritual hypocrisy.
Mr. Kushner actually won for half a play. "Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes" is, all told, a 7-hour epic divided into two parts: "Millennium Approaches" and "Perestroika." Part 1 has been mounted at the Eureka Theater in San Francisco and the Royal National Theater in London, and both parts were performed last fall at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Mr. Kushner is now rewriting "Perestroika," and the plan is to put it in repertory with "Millennium Approaches" on Broadway in the fall.
 
HISTORY
Gordon S. Wood
"The Radicalism
Of the American Revolution"
It was not as bloody or destructive as most, but if the American Revolution is measured by the standard of the degree of social change it produced, then it was "as radical and as revolutionary as any in history." So wrote Mr. Wood, 59, a professor of history at Brown University, in this landmark study. In a front-page review for the New York Times Sunday Book Review last year, another specialist in early American history called Mr. Wood's work "the most important study of the Revolution to appear in over 20 years."
 
MUSIC
Christopher Rouse
Trombone Concerto
Christopher Rouse, a 44-year-old composer who lives in Fairport, N.Y., won for his Trombone Concerto, a three-movement work that was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and given its premiere by the orchestra and its principal trombonist, Joseph Alessi, on Dec. 29. Like many of his works, the Trombone Concerto has currents of both despair and celebration: slow, mournful outer movements surround a loud, colorfully virtuosic middle section. Reviewing its premiere in The New York Times, Edward Rothstein described it as "distinctive, unsettling, yet structurally clear."
 
PUBLIC SERVICE
The Miami Herald
When Hurricane Andrew pummeled the Miami area last August, laying waste to entire communities and leaving 50,000 southern Dade County residents homeless, the newsroom staff of The Miami Herald found itself in the middle of the story. Dozens of editors and reporters were among those who lost homes in the storm, the costliest natural disaster in American history. In December, The Herald published an 18-page special section, "What Went Wrong?" which concluded, among other things, that lax building codes had worsened the scope of the devastation.
Pete Weitzel, the Herald's senior managing editor, said he believed the newspaper's most important work may have come in the days after the storm, when it published basic survival information and provided a column for residents looking for friends and relatives with whom they had lost contact. "I think the greatest public service was in providing people with all that kind of information that the traditional journalist would say is average, everyday stuff," he said. "It's all the necessities of life."
 
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING
Jeff Brazil and Steve Berry
The Orlando Sentinel
Jeff Brazil and Steve Berry reported that the Volusia County (Fla.) Sheriff had seized $8 million in cash from motorists on Interstate 95 as part of a anti-drug effort. Ninety percent of those whose money was confiscated were black or Hispanic drivers stopped for minor traffic violations. A governor's task force is investigating the sheriff's squad. Mr. Berry, 45, has a master's degree in history from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Mr. Brazil, 31, graduated from the University of Santa Clara in California.
 
SPOT NEWS REPORTING
The Los Angeles Times
For what the Pulitzer board described as its "balanced, comprehensive, penetrating coverage" of the second day of the riots in South Central Los Angeles, the staff of The Los Angeles Times was awarded the prize for spot news reporting. The stories, covering the second day of the rioting that swept the city after four policeman were acquitted of beating Rodney G. King, a black motorist, varied from the revenge beating of Reginald O. Denny, a white truck driver, to the ways in which everyday life in the city were shattered by the violence.
C. Shelby Coffey 3d, The Times's editor, compared the mobilization of the newsroom for the riots to the paper's coverage of the war in the Persian Gulf, except that "this was literally right in our backyard." The story was in the paper's front yard, too: on the first night of the violence, rioters attacked the Times building in downtown Los Angeles, causing about $500,000 in damage.
 
INTERNATIONAL REPORTING
John F. Burns of The New York Times
Roy Gutman of Newsday
Two Pulitzer Prizes were awarded for international reporting, both to veteran foreign correspondents for their coverage of the violent conflict and human suffering in the Balkans. John F. Burns of The New York Times was cited for his "courageous and thorough coverage of the destruction of Sarajevo and the barbarous killings in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina." He began his assignment in the region in early 1992 after months of treatment for lymphoma. In one 275-day period he wrote 163 articles, 103 datelined from the perilous city of Sarajevo. Roy W. Gutman of Newsday was cited for his "courageous and persistent reporting that disclosed atrocities and other human rights violations in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina." His articles included the first lengthy account of what Newsday described as death camps in Bosnia. Mr. Burns, 48, a native of Nottingham, England, joined The Times in 1975. Mr. Gutman, 49, joined Newsday in 1982.
 
NATIONAL REPORTING
David Maraniss
The Washington Post
The life and political record of Bill Clinton were the subject of the series of articles that won the national reporting prize for David Maraniss of The Washington Post. Mr. Maraniss, 43, said of Mr. Clinton: "He's deeply complex, both a representative and unique figure of his generation. He is endlessly fascinating." Working for newspapers runs in the Maraniss family: he is the grandson of a printer and the son of two editors.
 
BEAT REPORTING
Paul Ingrassia and Joseph B. White
The Wall Street Journal
In their coverage of the tumultuous management changes in 1992 at the General Motors Corporation, in which a former chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Stemple, was forced from office, Paul Ingrassia and Joseph B. White of The Wall Street Journal provided an unusually detailed account of the inner workings of a corporate board of directors. "This was a board at the cutting edge of corporate governance activism," said Mr. Ingrassia. "It rose up against management." Mr. Ingrassia, 42, a Mississippi native, received a master's degree in journalism from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Mr. White, 34, who was born in New York City, graduated from Harvard University.
 
FEATURE WRITING
George Lardner Jr.
The Washington Post
George Lardner Jr. won for an investigation of the murder of his own daughter by a former boyfriend. While journalists are often reluctant to write about a subject to which they have a personal tie, Mr. Lardner brought a powerful sense of urgency to his analysis of faults in the criminal justice system. Mr. Lardner, 58, said yesterday that winning a Pulitzer Prize for such a topic was bittersweet: "I'm stunned, elated and sad all at once." Mr. Lardner, whose great-uncle, Ring Lardner, was also an author and journalist, has been a reporter and columnist at The Post since 1963. He graduated from Marquette University.
 
COMMENTARY
Liz Balmaseda
The Miami Herald
Liz Balmaseda was cited for her articles from Haiti on the deteriorating political and social conditions there, and for her columns on the lives of Cuban-Americans in Miami. The 34-year-old journalist was born in Cuba 17 days after Castro took power in the 1959 revolution and left with her family for Miami at the age of 10 months. She said yesterday: "I try with the column to reflect the real Miami. It is ever-changing, multi-ethnic and multi-racial. I also want to show the Cuban exile community to be the politically and culturally diverse community that it is."
 
EXPLANATORY JOURNALISM
Mike Toner
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
Mr. Toner's series, "When Bugs Bite Back," had its roots in a five-year-old Federal report on drug-resistant strains of venereal disease. "We began thinking about how 'Better Living Through Chemistry' has changed our lives and the world in ways that give us pause," said Mr. Toner's editor, Mike King. The result was 15 articles that explored the dimishing effectiveness and the overuse of antibiotics and pesticides.Mr. Toner, 48, is a graduate of the University of Iowa and received a master's degree from Northwestern University.
 
CRITICISM
Michael Dirda
The Washington Post
Michael Dirda, who describes himself as "a writer and appreciator of books," won for his book reviews, covering a wide variety of subjects, including biblical studies, children's literature, thrillers and translations of the classics. For the past 15 years, Mr. Dirda, 44, has been an assistant editor and writer for The Washington Post Book World. Until recently he was a board member of the National Book Critics Circle. Son of a steelworker, he grew up in the steel town of Lorain, Ohio. He says of his literary criticism: "I like to convey my enthusiasm for reading and remind people how good the classics are."
 
EDITORIAL WRITING
No award
 
EDITORIAL CARTOONING
Stephen R. Benson
The Arizona Republic
Stephen R. Benson says he believes that editorial cartoons "should take a point of view and be acidic, passionate and hard-hitting." He won for his work on a wide spectrum of themes, including starvation in Somalia and the United States economy. Mr. Benson, a 39-year-old graduate of Brigham Young University, has been editorial cartoonist at The Republic for 11 years. "It's better than sitting there and screaming at Peter Jennings on television," he said.
 
FEATURE PHOTOGRAPHY
The Associated Press
For the third straight year, The Associated Press won a photography award, this time in the feature category for 20 images documenting Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign. The photographs were made by 10 staff members based around the country.
 
SPOT NEWS PHOTOGRAPHY
William Snyder and Ken Geiger
The Dallas Morning News
Two graduates of the Rochester Institute of Technology, William Snyder and Ken Geiger of The Dallas Morning News, won the spot news photography award for images of the Summer Olympics in Barcelona. It was the third Pulitzer for Mr. Snyder, 33, who began his photography career at age 14 shooting football games for his hometown newspaper in Henderson, Ky. Mr. Geiger, a 35-year-old native of Bremerton, Wash., became a photojournalist because job prospects seemed dim in forestry, which he had planned to study in college.

HEADLINE: I.R.A.'s Surging As More People Invest in Funds

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
For Linda Wollman, the perils of darting through Park Avenue's rush-hour pile-ups on her Rollerblades were nothing compared with the risk of getting caught short of cash when she retires in, oh, about the year 2029. So with today's deadline for I.R.A. contributions looming, on Tuesday evening she rolled into the Fidelity Investments office at Park and 51st Street in Manhattan to drop off a check and an Individual Retirement Account form for her husband.
Fearful of losing their jobs, unwilling to count on pensions or Social Security, many, like Mrs. Wollman, are turning to I.R.A.'s with greater enthusiasm than at any time since Congress sharply limited the deductibility of contributions made after the spring of 1987.
 
Job-Change Flux
 Several mutual funds and brokerage firms say that today will conclude their strongest I.R.A. season ever. The increases in the number of I.R.A. mutual fund accounts and the money invested in them set records last year, according to the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group. The year-end total of 24.3 million accounts was up by more than 3.7 million from the end of 1991. 
 Much of this money is coming from people rolling over their payouts from retirement plans when they change, or lose, their jobs. Corporate layoffs and the evaporation of benefits for those who remain have forced more workers to take retirement planning into their own hands.
The growing ranks of part-time and temporary workers, usually lacking retirement plans at their jobs, are among those who can still take full or partial tax deductions for I.R.A. contributions of up to $2,000. For those covered by corporate retirement plans, with incomes above certain limits -- about half of all workers -- only the earnings on their I.R.A. accounts remain tax-free until withdrawn.
The new rules on deductions initially curtailed the growth of I.R.A.'s, with fewer than 700,000 mutual fund accounts added in 1988. But a new surge in interest, many financial executives say, has come as those born after the World War II recognize that decisions made now will help determine how comfortably they pass the final decades of their lives.
"The boomers are beginning to embrace the new frugality," said Don Underwood, a vice president for retirement planning at Merrill Lynch. At the seminars he offers around the country, he said, about 30 percent of the participants are under 40, twice as many as five years ago. "They are changing from being a group of spenders to being a group of savers."
Indeed, total I.R.A. investments through all sources -- including banks, brokerage firms, savings and loans and mutual funds -- reached $724.7 billion at the end of last year, up $90.9 billion from the year before, according to the Investment Company Institute.
Now, the new savings are going primarily to mutual funds and brokerage firms. They heavily invest the money in portfolios of stocks, whose high long-range returns tend to compensate for the risks.
The business had been dominated by banks and savings and loans, but the rates on certificates of deposits have fallen to dismal levels. Mrs. Wollman, who calls herself Linda Ross when she sings in nightclubs, still keeps her own I.R.A. at Chemical Bank. She was too embarrassed to reveal her interest rate but swore she would hunt for an alternative.
The current I.R.A. marketing war has brought fusillades of pamphlets and guides, with advertisements and press releases blaring about ways to avoid a penniless retirement. Fees have faded.
Charles Schwab, the nation's largest discount brokerage, has dropped its $22 annual fees for accounts of at least $10,000, and promises current investors that the fees will never return. Schwab added 321,000 I.R.A. accounts last year, a 69 percent gain to 786,000.
For retirement accounts only, Fidelity has waived its 3 percent sales charges on many of its stock funds. The company's mutual fund sales of more than $1.5 billion in the first three months of 1993 surpassed the $1.2 billion recorded in the first quarter of 1987 and the $600 million during the same period last year.
Today is the last chance for making I.R.A. contributions for the 1992 tax year. The Fidelity center on Park Avenue has remained open an extra hour and a half, until 7 P.M., this week to handle a rush of new business.
 
Discontent on the Line
 In a line of customers a couple days ago, discontent was brewing. "You reach a certain age and you have nothing to fall back on," said Linda A. Conklin. A succession of temporary jobs and spells of unemployment have left her with little, so she borrowed the money from her parents to start an I.R.A. "Who knows what we'll have left in Social Security?" she said. "Probably won't be there."
Advancing in line, she reached the polished granite information counter. "How old are you?" a salesman asked.
"Excuse me?" she said, frowning.
"Well, if you have more than 10 years till retirement . . ." the salesman began, then halted. Glancing at her fashionably slouching leather jacket and creaseless skin, he started over by recommending some funds for decades-long gains.
Ivars and Sandra Slokenberg, both 28, were meanwhile just completing the transfer of money from taxable accounts to new I.R.A.'s, where investment income accumulates tax-free. A warm winter vacation or a down payment on a car might have left them without the money to fulfill the savings plans made since their marriage last June. "If you spend the money, you have to pay tax on it," Mr. Slokenberg said.
The Slokenbergs, like many young people, still qualify to make tax-deductible contributions. Through the 1986 tax year, virtually everyone could contribute as much as $2,000 tax-free. Since then, anyone covered by a retirement plan at work can take a full or partial deduction only if their income, after certain adjustments, is less than $50,000 for joint filers or $35,000 for individuals.
Most investment advisers say that the tax savings and investment income are greatest for those who contribute at the beginning of the tax year. But few get around to it until they are signing their returns more than a year later.

HEADLINE: NEW TAX ON GOODS IS WEIGHED TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
The White House said today that it was considering a value-added tax -- an indirect form of sales tax -- to help pay for President Clinton's health-care package. But it insisted that the President had not made any final decision on such a sweeping new proposal to raise revenue.
President Clinton first broached the idea of a value-added tax, which is imposed on goods and services at each stage of production but ultimately paid for by the consumer, in February. He then backed away, calling it a "radical change" that could only be looked at in years ahead.
 
Back on the Table
 But in the past two days, the Health and Human Services Secretary, Donna E. Shalala, and Deputy Budget Director Alice M. Rivlin said in separate statements that such a tax was now being considered to pick up some of the cost of Mr. Clinton's plan, estimated at $50 billion to $100 billion a year. 
 The White House communications director, George Stephanopoulos, confirmed Ms. Shalala's statement. In an interview published in USA Today, he said, "This is something that is being looked at, but no decision has been made."
The effect of a value-added tax is virtually the same to the consumer as a retail sales tax, since the ultimate buyer eventually absorbs the cost, but the many European countries with VAT's have found them to be harder to evade.
 
Departure From Earlier Stand
 Mr. Stephanopoulos's acknowledgement came during a heated question-and-answer-period with reporters in which he initially did all that he could to avoid confirming that a value-added tax was being considered by the Administration. In doing so, he contradicted a statement by Mr. Clinton on Feb. 19 that such a tax "is not something that is now under consideration; if we start considering it, I'll tell you."
Eventually, Mr. Stephanopoulos conceded that the tax was now one of several being weighed by the task force. But he said that no firm proposal had been presented yet to Mr. Clinton.
The President is not expected to unveil the components of his health-care package, aimed at providing every American a minimum level of health insurance, until mid-May.
"They have examined the possibility of a VAT," said Mr. Stephanopoulos. "Has it been presented to the President? Has he made a decision? No, he has not."
One reason the White House is so reluctant to concede that such a tax is under discussion is the fear it will divert attention from the President's efforts to sell his $19.5 billion jobs package, which has been trapped in the Senate by a Republican filibuster. Part of the Republican argument is that Mr. Clinton is already calling for too many new taxes. Any talk of a value-added tax would undercut White House efforts to focus public attention on Republican opposition.
 
Issue on the Table
 Nevertheless, shortly after Mr. Stephanopoulos spoke, Ms. Rivlin told a gathering of the National Manufacturers Association that a value-added tax was very much on the table.
"A VAT is clearly a possible candidate," she said, apparently unaware of how the White House was trying to play it down. "I think a VAT has a good deal to recommend it."
Ms. Rivlin acknowledged that such taxes, unlike income taxes, fall most heavily on the poor and middle class. Therefore, such a tax "must be designed so as not to be painful to lower-income groups," she said.
Administration officials said the reason such a tax was now under active consideration is because the proposed tax increase on alcohol and cigarettes being looked at by the health policy task force would not be sufficient to pay for universal health coverage.
 
Popular in Europe
 In the interview in USA Today, Ms. Shalala said: "We've talked a lot about sin taxes. Certainly, we're looking a VAT tax."
She added, "But all of this would have to be phased in, and what we first must do is have the mechanisms in place to slow down existing spending."
Value-added taxes are used in more than 50 countries, particularly in Europe. They are usually applied by taxing the total value of sales of all businesses, but allowing businesses to claim a credit for taxes paid on their purchases of raw materials. The net effect is that only sales to the consumer end up being taxed.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, a 5 percent value-added tax would increase the Treasury's net revenues by about $68 billion in the fiscal year 1995 and by about $417 billion through 1998.
 
How It Works in Europe
 If applied as a percentage of the price, a value-added tax would affect all goods equally. But some European VAT's exclude food, medicine and housing as well as many financial services, for which the tax is hard to calculate.
Ms. Rivlin said that because state and municipal governments relfied on sales taxes to help finance their budgets they would probably oppose a Federal value-added tax, so "there would have to be an accommodation to state and local governments."
Asked about the Administration's apparent change of position, Mr. Stephanopoulos said: "I think what the President's concern is to make sure he gets the best health-care proposal possible. He's concerned at making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives."
Talk of a value-added tax is certain to complicate Mr. Clinton's efforts to sell his jobs bill. Representative Robert Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, announced plans today for a series of town hall meetings on Saturday to generate opposition to the President's plan to stimulate the economy, while Mr. Clinton argued that the new spending was essential.
Speaking today to a conference on summer jobs, co-sponsored by the Departments of Labor and Education and attended by many mayors, Mr. Clinton contended that while his stimulus package was only "a small part of a big budget" it would nevertheless cut the unemployment rate by half a percent and generate 700,000 part-time jobs this summer for young people.
 
Looking for the Answers
 "I don't have all the answers, but I do know this, doing nothing is not the answer," said Mr. Clinton, whose aides have been making available letters by various Republican mayors and governors who back the package.
"We recognize the need for our Republican Party to express concern about budget cuts and reducing the deficit," several Republican mayors said in a letter today to the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas. "At the same time, we believe that the stimulus initiative being proposed by the Clinton Administration is most important to unemployed people in our cities."
