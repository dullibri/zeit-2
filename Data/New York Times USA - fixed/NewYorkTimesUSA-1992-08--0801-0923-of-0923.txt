Being in the Bronx
In the last decade, multi-culturalism has become a buzz word in the art world. That concept has affected art institutions in different ways. Manhattan's major museums, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art, have tried to diversify their programs and collections, but at their own pace. The Bronx Museum of the Arts -- situated in an area where minorities are now in the majority -- doesn't have this option. Multi-culturalism isn't theoretical; it's right outside the door.
The museum was conceived in the 1960's by a group of Riverdale residents, in part to bring mainstream art to the Bronx. It was officially founded in 1971 with a show of Impressionist paintings on loan from the Met and displayed in the rotunda of the Bronx County Courthouse. Since then, it has moved to its own building and grown as a community-based, grass-roots institution, with all the liabilities that status implies. It doesn't have a reliable financial base in the form of a powerful board of trustees or wealthy patrons. ("Simply put, we can't throw a party and clear $100,000," says the museum's president, Elizabeth Cooke.) And it doesn't have a long-established permanent collection like the Brooklyn Museum's to give it an academic pedigree. 
 What it has had is a strong and specific ethnic identification with Hispanic art. When the museum moved to a converted synagogue on the Grand Concourse at 165th Street in 1983, it inaugurated its new home with one of the first major local exhibitions of contemporary Latin American art. It has a curator of Latin American art, the only staff member with an ethnic specialization, and with a Ford Foundation grant, it has developed a new Latin American art research department, one of the first of its kind in the city.
 
Seeing a Wider World
 But does this identity jibe with the notion of multi-cultural diversity? The museum's director, Grace Stanislaus, who came to her job just eight months ago, thinks not. As she points out, the Bronx Museum was established with no ethnic alignment but was created to serve the whole Bronx community, a community that is "constantly shifting," she says. "Right now we have new Russian and Mexican populations coming in to join the Hispanic, Irish, Italian, black, Jewish and Asian populations already here in strength. This is the ideal setting for talking about multi-culturalism, and I want to reposition the museum as a truly multi-cultural institution."
In many ways, Ms. Stanislaus, a 33-year-old native of the island of Carriacou in the West Indies, is suited to the task. She comes to the Bronx Museum from the Studio Museum in Harlem, another grass-roots institution, where she worked after earning a master's degree in 20th-century art from Columbia University in 1982. At the Studio Museum, she organized the influential exhibition "Contemporary African Artists: Changing Traditions," a version of which traveled to the 1990 Venice Biennale. The show had its problems -- the individual work was not uniformly strong -- but virtually for the first time it placed contemporary non-Western art on a continuum with its Western counterparts, and demonstrated the increasingly international and synthetic flavor of art worldwide.
This feel for cultural breadth in today's art is likely to be the strong suit of Ms. Stanislaus's still untested tenure at the Bronx. (The museum is scheduled to reopen in October after being closed for renovations, and Ms. Stanislaus has yet to mount an exhibition there.) She is well aware that her plans for diversity within the museum won't necessarily guarantee an audience, diversified or otherwise. "We don't want to be perceived as a provincial museum," says Ms. Cooke. Yet like many small institutions scattered throughout the other boroughs, the Bronx Museum gets relatively light foot-traffic from Manhattan. A plan to attract more visitors by adding a restaurant, a theater and a parking garage, financed by the city and the borough, was scheduled for completion this year but is now on hold.
At the same time, people from the immediate neighborhood also tend to keep their distance. "They stand at the bus stop and look in, trying to figure out what we're doing in here," Ms. Stanislaus says. "In this community, drugs, violence and survival are big concerns. Many of the adults and kids have never traveled outside the neighborhood. Obviously, these people aren't typical museumgoers. We have to teach them what art is, how you value it, how you integrate it into your life." One approach is the museum's free after-school art programs, which, Ms. Stanislaus says, "offer at least a temporary sanctuary from the streets and from often difficult home situations."
She added: "In general, I look at this museum as a human-services institution, a place where life and art intersect."
 
It's All in the Plans
 The attempt to combine life and art, downtown and uptown sensibilities, art appreciation and scholarship, and in general to shape an institution which by its very nature has contradictory needs and impulses, is reflected in exhibition plans for the next few years.
When the museum reopens, the season is to include two traveling shows of Hispanic art, both scheduled before Ms. Stanislaus's arrival and both historical in nature. The first, organized by the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery in Austin, Tex., will be "The School of the South: El Taller Torres-Garcia and Its Legacy," devoted to a workshop and school opened in Uruguay by the painter Joaquin Torres-Garcia in 1943. A utopian art community, it had far-reaching impact on Latin American artists of succeeding generations. "Learning about it may give a new perspective to people who don't think of Latin American art as being formal or structured," Ms. Stanislaus adds.
That show is to be followed in March by "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985." A traveling multi-media exhibition that originated at the Wight Art Gallery at the University of California at Los Angeles, its lively, politically loaded work may well find a responsive audience among the Bronx's Hispanic residents. Next summer, the museum plans to present historical material of a somewhat different kind when, in conjunction with the New York City Health and Hospital Art Program, it mounts an exhibition of recently conserved W.P.A. murals painted in New York City. The show will be supplemented with mural studies, photographs and other historical materials.
Of interest, too, are plans for theme shows that will include an ethnically wide spectrum of participants. One exhibition, scheduled for 1994, is to examine artists whose work Ms. Stanislaus describes as "urban and rural-based folk art," primarily from salvaged and recycled materials. Listed among the artists are David Hammons, Tyree Guyton, Alison Saar, Jesse Lott, Leonardo Drew, Nick Quijano and Catalina Paira. "Some of these people might not consider themselves folk artists," Ms. Stanislaus says. "But they all recognize that there is a spiritual power inherent in objects, and they know that the material they choose has meanings for the community they live in. They aren't, in other words, 'naive,' as they are often portrayed as being."
For 1995, the museum plans a historical reassessment of feminist art, with an exhibition and a series of seminars focusing on feminist scholarship in art criticism. The museum's 25th anniversary in 1996 will bring a show devoted to the art of contemporary Asian-Americans (an ethnic group with whom, Ms. Stanislaus admits, the museum has so far had little contact), and another titled "Black Artists in Britain." And for 1997 she has scheduled what may end up being the first major show of contemporary American Indian art.
 
Expanding the Permanent
 Finally, Ms. Stanislaus says, she intends to expand the Bronx Museum's still-young permanent collection. Six years ago it was decided that the museum would buy only works on paper, mostly by 20th-century Latin American and black artists, although Ms. Stanislaus says she would like to begin collecting in other media. "Building the collection is a way of preserving a culture," she says, "but above all, it's great for the individual artists, who get a museum credential even though they may never be represented in other major collections."
A show of selections from the permanent collection scheduled for spring 1993 will also provide an incentive for doing the kind of scholarly documentation that has so far been neglected. Ms. Stanislaus has made finding money for publications a priority. "It's just a basic fact that there isn't a lot of interest in publishing material about these artists," she says. "So we have to do it."
Is she ever discouraged about having to swim upstream? "No," she says. "I have real faith in our artists. They haven't been exhausted by success, chewed up and spit out, at least not yet. We're not trying to satisfy a market. We're just working and struggling. And that means something fresh is still going on out here at the periphery."
 
Photo Gallery
 Photography galleries seem to have fared better than most over the last several years, but it still might appear risky to open a new gallery in the middle of a recession. Next month, though, Robert Mann, a private photography dealer for seven years, will go against the trends and open a Manhattan gallery under his own name. It will be in the same building he's currently in, at 42 East 76th Street. "When the space next door became available, I just saw it as a blessing of conveniences," Mr. Mann says of his decision to go public. "I outgrew the space here and I outgrew being a private dealer as well."
The new gallery will open with an exhibition of work by Aaron Siskind, who achieved fame for his close-up abstractions of peeling paint and torn posters on walls. Included in the show, Mr. Mann says, will be an album from 1930 to 1932 that Siskind made with his first camera, given to him as a wedding present. "It's fascinating," Mr. Mann says of these early pictures. "He could have gone in any one of a number of directions: into architectural photography, or portrait, or documentary."
A few of the pictures, Mr. Mann says, were even made on the artist's honeymoon.

Tom Brokaw's Pop Quiz for America's Schools

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
In "America's Schools: Pass or Fail?," Tom Brokaw visits three innovative schools that are working to reverse the downward course of American education. In Leadville, Colo., a school known as the Center is open from early morning till after dark, offering educational, health and social services to students and their families. A Philadelphia high school is managing to get more inner-city youths interested in learning. Magnet schools in Los Angeles seem to be giving off sparks.
Mr. Brokaw maintains a respectful yet skeptical attitude as he questions teachers, principals and other educators. The big problem for all the schools, most agree, begins at home, where parents are too busy or ignorant or troubled to give children the sort of start that most had a generation or two ago. Can programs that engage these youngsters also teach them the facts and skills they will need to hold good jobs? Mr. Brokaw predicts change but sensibly resists making any grand promises.
 
Egypt
Beyond the Pyramids
TBS
Sunday at 9 P.M.
"National Geographic Explorer" starts its new season with a visit to the Great Pyramids on the Giza Plateau to investigate, with the help of archeologists, the mystery of who built the pyramids. The main news here is that the workers are now believed by some to have been not slaves, but conscripted laborers.
After this dose of scholarship, the host, Robert Urich, relaxes with a report on Lucy, who is described as the world's premier belly dancer. An ancient art, it says here, but Lucy looks thoroughly modern. And the final segment of this undemanding two-hours reports on Thor Heyerdahl's theory that Egyptian merchants crossed the Atlantic to the Americas 2,000 years before Columbus. Then how come the West had to wait so long for belly dancing?
 
The Sunday Talkies
In recognition of the fact that the next two months of Sunday talk shows will be largely devoted to Presidential politics, here are a few tips on how to listen to the language of the partisan guests:
"Let's move on." This is a signal that the guest would rather talk about something other than the question asked. Democrats like to move on from the Congressional bank and post-office embarrassments. Republicans prefer to move on from the Administration's policy toward Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait and, in general, from questions about the economy. They will often get away with it by turning abruptly to the next questioner.
"Frankly." This word, as used by politicians, invariably precedes a statement that comes right out of their prepared package. From a Republican: "Frankly, George Bush has an economic program." From a Democrat: "Frankly, Bill Clinton is a family man."
"The American people." This phrase is waved each week by representatives of both parties like warriors who have run out of ammunition. Frankly, it signals the moment to hit the remote and move on.

The Economy
The gross domestic product grew at a puny 1.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the Government said, citing consumers' reluctance to spend. But a record drop in applications for unemployment insurance in mid-August and better corporate profits offered glimmers of hope for improved growth later. [Page D1.]
Battalions of insurance adjusters visited South Florida, trying to reach the tens of thousands of home owners who need cash for emergency supplies, food and shelter. But so overwhelming is the devastation from Hurricane Andrew that they are having great difficulty getting together with policyholders. [A15.] 
 The dollar's tumble has been an alarm bell in the world's currency markets in recent weeks. But in Washington, no one seems to be listening. Low interest rates, which greased its slide, have far more political appeal than a sound currency. [D2.]
A new incinerator is to be built in the Brooklyn Navy Yard under a long-range rubbish plan voted by the New York City Council. It also calls for increased recycling. [A1.]
 
Companies
Continental Airlines got a $400 million bid from Air Canada and two Texas financiers. The offer may touch off another bidding war for the bankrupt carrier. The Texans are associated with Robert M. Bass, who is not involved in the offer. [D1.]
Apple plans inexpensive home computers based on its Macintosh line, hoping to snare first-time buyers away from cheap I.B.M. clones, which now sell for well below $1,000. Analysts said the machines would offer an optional built-in CD-ROM player. [D3.]
The U.A.W. struck a General Motors metal fabricating plant in Lordstown, Ohio, over job security, leading G.M.'s Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., to plan an early stop to car assembly today. More G.M. assembly plants could shut within days. [D3.]
G.M. closed the last car plant in Southern California, a once busy factory that had operated for 45 years in Van Nuys. [D3.] Mycogen agreed to form a venture with Lubrizol to buy Lubrizol's seed and plant science unit in a transaction valued at about $135 million. The companies plan to develop genetically engineered biological crop pesticides and seed products. [D4.]
A bid for Canary Wharf was cut by $227.7 million, to $465.3 million, by an investors group that includes Paul Reichmann, the head of Olympia & York, which started the London project. [D4.]
 
International
The Japanese Government prepared to announce a huge financial rescue package aimed at stimulating the economy, shoring up the banking system and returning confidence to the sagging stock and real estate markets. [D1.]
Mexican toy manufactures are disgruntled at the competition expected from the North American Free Trade Agreement. [D1.]
 
 Markets
The Dow average gained 7.83 to close at 3,254.64, lifted by a stronger dollar and upswings in overseas markets. [D6.]
Prices of Treasury securities edged up after the Fed reported much lower money supply growth than expected. [D5.]
The dollar edged up to 1.4085 marks, and rose against most other currencies as well. Gold prices also rose. [D13.]
Sugar futures settled sharply higher in reaction to reports of extensive hurricane damage to the Louisiana sugar crop. [D13.]
 
Today's Columns
Bond mutual funds are attracting near record amounts of money. Much of it is going into funds that buy foreign bonds. But stock fund sales have weakened this month, reflecting growing caution among investors. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D1.]
Tri-Star Pictures' decision to move up Woody Allen's film, "Husbands and Wives," and broaden its release was endorsed by executives involved in advertising, marketing and promoting movies and other entertainment. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D6.]

HEADLINE: New Ball Game for Mexican Toys

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico

 BODY:
"Nobody likes this Free Trade Agreement," said Eduardo Iga Saade. He was speaking as a Mexican toy maker. "I was very happy making my lousy products. People bought them, I took my vacations, and everything was fine."
Yet five years after a first reduction of trade barriers turned the manufacture of tea sets, plastic trucks and the like into one of Mexico's more perilous industrial ventures, Mr. Iga and the family-run company he heads are just the sort of survivors that the Government hopes will emerge from the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and the United States that was announced on Aug. 12. 
 Like Plasticos Iga S.A., the Mexican toy industry as a whole seems to sketch an unusually stark picture of the fate of some light manufacturing in transforming an elaborately protected, developing economy into a more modern, open and service-oriented one.
A week after the accord was announced, the president of the Mexican Toy Industry Association, Maria Teresa Kassuga, said she was still trying to find out how the trade agreement would affect tariffs on toys. What seems clear, however, is that in continuing to adjust from big profit margins, low productivity and a captive clientele, the toy industry will be even more disadvantaged by scant information about its foreign competitors and limited capital for new investment. Unlike many larger Mexican industrialists, toy makers did not have the clout to lobby trade officials for more time to scale back barriers to imports.
Although President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has insisted that the new trade pact will not "damage our industry or our countryside," economists contend that industries like toys, textiles, paper, furniture, petrochemicals and automotive parts will suffer especially from greater foreign competition because of the cost of becoming more efficient.
"From the time they started to talk about free trade, what we had to do was clear," said Carlos Iga Saade, the head of purchasing for the company founded in 1964 by his father, Carlos Iga Canavati. "We either become more efficient or we close down."
Toy makers have already had a considerable taste of the difficulties of competing on a global scale, having gone through spasms since Mexico entered the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade five years ago.
With that first opening, a wall to foreign imports dropped to a tariff of 40 percent. And as the tariff has since fallen to 20 percent, smugglers have taken advantage of the opening to flood the market with new, used and defective toys that are priced to reflect only the premiums of corrupt officials. Just since last year, 80 of the 265 members of the trade association have disappeared, victims of Barbie Dolls, Cabbage Patch Dolls, Ninja Turtles and the like.
Previously, one Mexican company, Grupo Auriga, had dominated the Mexican toy market in a joint venture with Mattel Inc. of El Segundo, Calif. Plasticos Iga and a half-dozen other Mexican companies had divided up much of the remainder.
Toys would sometimes be sold for twice the cost of manufacturing, advertising, royalties and overhead, Eduardo Iga said. Profit margins of 30 percent were taken for granted. And so was the expense, he added, "of all sorts of absurd things."
"We had our own construction engineer up here on salary in case we needed to fix any of the bathrooms or remodel an office," he recalled. "All of the big companies -- us included -- did whatever we wanted with the buyers. We did what we wanted with the price, with the quality. We got very cocky."
After years of making and distributing different foreign branded toys, Iga bought a license from Hasbro Inc. of Pawtucket, R.I., to make and sell its Transformers toys. The item became Mexico's hit toy of 1986, and Iga grew even cockier. Like other companies, Iga decided it would only sell distributors its Transformers and other popular items if they also bought a package of less popular toys. The sales of the company zoomed to about $15 million, while its market share grew to about 10 percent.
 
A Shift in Strategy
 But within barely two years, the Transformers' novelty had worn off. In picking other foreign toys to make and distribute, the company acknowledges that it chose badly. Legal and contraband imports flooded the market.
With its sales plummeting and debts of about $6 million to a handful of Mexican banks, Iga was forced into bankruptcy proceedings. Workers were laid off by the hundreds, executives by the handful. From 2,100 workers in 1986, the payroll shrunk to fewer than 900. The company closed divisions, sold off most of its property and struggled to imagine how it could survive the new waves of foreign competition, Eduardo Iga said.
"By the time people saw it coming, it was smashing them in the face," he said of freer trade.
Given a choice between shutting down or hanging on, Plasticos Iga began doing business differently.
It bought licenses for foreign products more selectively. It started to make and assemble pieces for foreign companies, including Mattel, though the profit on such work is typically around 5 percent. And the Igas and their engineers began learning more about the intricacies of engineering plastics, like the television cabinets they are now starting to make for Zenith. They courted their Mexican clients more aggressively, too, offering them better credit and lowering prices.
 
Problems Persist
 Yet with all of Iga's sense of renewal comes little sense of security.
Unlike smaller members of Mexico's small-business association, Iga cannot qualify for small, cut-rate credits. Because it no longer owns the land in Monterrey on which its plant sits, it can borrow from commercial banks only at annual rates of between 25 percent and 31 percent. So to buy new plastic-injection machines, Iga needed credit from the manufacturer. And to keep clients, the company said it must offer distributors not only higher quality toys at better prices, but finance terms as well.
Although the cost of plastic has come down in Mexico, the expense of everything else the company uses -- from labels and packing materials to telephone services and tiny screws -- conspires against Iga's new push to become competitive with American and Canadian companies.
Iga looks at Processed Plastics Inc. of Montgomery, Ill., a company from which Iga has bought toy molds for a decade, and marvels at its scale and efficiency. With $40 million in annual sales last year, Processed Plastics is about four times Iga's current size. The thought that it and other American companies will seize on the free trade agreement to push harder into Mexico fairly terrifies the Igas.
"They make better molds," Eduardo Iga noted. "They have higher volume. Their assembly and production lines are much more efficient because they can automate so much. And their supplies are much cheaper."
Walking around the Iga brothers' bustling plant, one comparative advantage is especially obvious: On the lines of workers assembling plastic trucks, toy motorcycles and sets of tiny dishes, the young women said they were paid as little as the local minimum wage of $3.97 for a 10-hour day of intense, almost uninterrupted work.
Nor do such hazards as the plastic cement fumes that rise from open vats raise concerns about liability suits by the workers. "That doesn't happen here," Eduardo Iga said.
Mrs. Kassuga, the industry association president, said that when she invited buyers from Mattel and Hasbro to meet with Mexican toy manufacturers, the American executives reported that Mexican labor costs were high compared with those of Asian countries like China, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Although Mexican trade officials have released scant details about the new agreement, the United States Commerce and Treasury departments said that Mexico's 20 percent tariffs on foreign-made dolls would be phased out over five years. The country's tariff of 10 to 20 percent on toys with wheels would be eliminated over 10 years. One-quarter of the remaining nonrubber toys would begin moving into Mexico duty-free as soon as the trade accord goes into effect, another quarter after five years and the rest after 10 years, the officials said.
In the absence of information about the new rules, Eduardo Iga said he could only assume that his competition would stiffen. "Sooner or later, they are going to come at us, so we are better off trying to join them," he said.

Bond Funds Attracting Surge of Cash

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
With interest rates down and the dollar falling, Americans are pouring money at a near record pace into mutual funds that invest in bonds, and much of that money is going into funds that buy foreign bonds, fund managers said yesterday.
But stock fund sales, which have been strong for all of 1992, weakened this month as some investors grew more cautious. 
 Investors searching for higher yields have increasingly been fleeing banks and money market funds, and much of the money has gone into bond funds. Figures released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, showed that a net $11.8 billion flowed into bond funds last month, 31 percent more than in June and the second-largest monthly figure ever.
 
Looking Back to 1987
 The record month for bond fund cash flow was set in January 1987, when $12.8 billion was invested. That was near the end of the last bull market in bonds, which drove long-term rates down to levels not seen again until this month.
The cash flow figures include both new sales and redemptions, as well as transfers among various fund groups. But the figures exclude reinvested dividends.
In July, stock prices were generally higher, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reached a record high. That spurred investors to put a net $6.8 billion into stock funds, up 46 percent from a depressed June figure of $4.6 billion. The June figure, which the trade group revised downward from $5.3 billion, was the lowest for any month since November.
Over all, the cash flow into long-term funds, both those specializing in stocks and bonds, came to $18.63 billion in July. That figure was also the second highest ever, just trailing the $18.68 billion figure for January 1987.
The stock market has weakened this month, in part because of concern over the dollar, and fund managers said some stock fund owners had decided to take profits. "Our stock fund activity is down 64 percent from July, but remember that July was one of our strongest months," said Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price funds.
At Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company, there was an increase in new sales of stock funds in August, said Michael Hines, a spokesman. But he added that this increase was offset by the fact that some investors had moved money from stock funds to other funds in an attempt to time market movements.
Such investors are often fickle, and one of the most striking facts about the surge into stock funds this year has been that the market timers have stayed positive. New transfers into stock funds were positive for four straight months, from April through July. Records going back to 1984 show no comparable string.
That the public is not yet very nervous about the stock market, despite the reports of slowing sales of stock funds in August, was reflected by a University of Michigan survey of investor attitudes, done for Fidelity. Preliminary data for August showed the most positive figures for plans to buy individual stocks since the survey began in 1990, as well as strong intentions to buy stock mutual funds.
The professionals who manage stock funds had been less bullish than their customers and have pushed cash levels in their funds to record levels. That continued in July, with net stock purchases by funds of only $4.5 billion, well under the funds' cash flow of $6.8 billion, and cash available in stock funds rose to $40.2 billion from $38.6 billion. But with stock prices up, the percentage of cash in funds slipped to 9.5 percent of assets from 9.6 percent.
With the dollar trading late this month at record lows against the German mark, and with interest rates significantly higher in much of Europe than in this country, the lure of international bond funds has been great. T. Rowe Price's best-selling fund this month was a new one, started at the beginning of the month, that specializes in short-term investments overseas. So far, it has taken in $35 million.
A similar fund at Scudder, Stevens & Clark had net cash flow in August of about $265 million, a spokesman, Gavin Quill, reported. That fund, which began this year with assets of $348 million, now boasts assets of $1.25 billion.
Such funds benefit from high foreign interest rates and have been able to report even better performance because the dollar has fallen, raising the dollar value of foreign bond portfolios. Their performances will suffer if the dollar begins to rise, but it appears that more and more investors are willing to bet that will not happen.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Sets Fiscal Package To Revive Ailing Economy

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Japanese Government prepared to announce a huge financial rescue package today aimed at stimulating growth in the nation's staggering economy and shoring up a banking system that has been endangered by the rapid fall in stocks and real estate prices.
One part of the double-barreled plan is expected to include roughly 10 trillion yen, or about $80 billion, in measures to stimulate growth through extra spending on public works and tax incentives to encourage businesses to invest in new equipment. 
 This package, known as a supplemental budget, is the largest ever and far exceeds the six trillion yen that was contemplated only two months ago, an indication of the growing sense of crisis here as the economy shows few signs of recovering.
The second part of the plan is aimed at reviving banks and other financial institutions, in part by providing tax incentives to help them write off bad loans.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed this morning on a plan that would then be presented to Government ministers for final approval this evening.
Economists have said the package will come too late to help the Government meet its target of 3.5 percent economic growth this fiscal year, which ends next March, although it should contribute to an economic recovery next year. Economists expect growth to be about 2 percent, which is very low by Japanese standards.
There was some speculation that the Government would have to take additional steps, like cutting the Bank of Japan's discount rate again from its current level of 3.25 percent.
Although economists have said they still harbor some doubts about the practical effects of the policies, the Tokyo stock market has soared over the last week in the belief that the Government plans to do whatever is necessary to shore up the financial system.
The market had its most spectacular day on Thursday, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues rocketing up 1,013.35 points, or 6.13 percent, to 17,555.00. In today's trading, the index closed with a gain of 415.79 points, or 2.37 percent, to 17,970.79.
The Nikkei has now jumped more than 25 percent in the last eight trading sessions, one of the most powerful rallies ever, after falling to a six-and-a-half-year low on Aug. 18.
 
Rising Trade Deficit
 The United States Government has been urging Japan to adopt such measures to help stimulate growth in the world economy and to provide a larger market for American exports to Japan. After years of shrinking, the politically troublesome American trade deficit with Japan has been rising again this year as Japan has cut back on imports.
The pump-priming measures agreed upon today by the ruling party center on an additional expenditure of some three trillion yen, or about $24 billion, for Federal public works projects, plus an addtional 1.8 trillion yen, or $14.4 billion, for local projects.
The plan also aims at reviving the dormant real estate market. Money will be allocated to help local governments buy land for future public works projects and to a Government agency that helps finance housing construction.
The plan will provide low-interest loans to small businesses and tax cuts to encourage companies to invest in energy-saving equipment.
 
A Forced Rescue
 The basic outline of the financial elements of the Government's package were announced last week, just as the stocks took a steep plunge, forcing the Finance Ministry to rescue the stock market.
The financial rescue focuses on easing a crisis of confidence in the banking system, which has been struggling under a mounting toll of bad loans.
The Finance Minister, Tsutomu Hata, said the Government would offer a series of tax concessions and ease other rules to enable banks to write off or make provisions for their bad loans. In addition, he said, banks would not be required to report the losses on their stock holdings for the six months ending Sept. 30, in the hope that what investors did not know would not hurt them.
Mr. Hata also issued a strong request that banks and other big financial institutions not unload those stocks on which they still showed a profit before Sept. 30.

HEADLINE: Slow Growth In 2d Quarter Is Confirmed

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
The economy stumbled in the second quarter as consumers showed reluctance to spend, the Government said today. But a record drop in applications for unemployment insurance in mid-August and an increase in corporate profits offered glimmers of hope for improved growth later this year.
The nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, inched up at a 1.4 percent annual pace, unchanged from an advance estimate released last month, the Commerce Department said. 
 That was less than half the 2.9 percent rate of the first quarter. Most of the deterioration came because consumer spending decreased two-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter after surging 5.1 percent in the first three months of the year.
 
An Encouraging Sign
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment benefits plunged to 382,000 during the week ended Aug. 15, down from 474,000 a week earlier. It was the largest decrease on record since the department began tracking claims in 1967 and the first time claims had fallen below 400,000 in 22 months.
Economists were encouraged and said the drop, if sustained, could give consumers the buying power and confidence needed to fuel more robust economic growth. But they cautioned against reading too much into the big decline, noting that the previous week's number was inflated by a temporary shutdown of General Motors factories.
"At the moment, I'm admiring the drop but I'm not reaching any strong conclusions about it," said Robert G. Dederick, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "We have to wait for more evidence."
On another bright note, the Commerce Department said profits of American corporations rose 2.1 percent to an annual rate of $234.6 billion in the second quarter, the highest level ever. The rise was built on a 10.8 percent increase in the first quarter, the best in four years.
Higher profits should eventually give businesses the ability to hire more workers and increase purchases of productivity-improving capital equipment. But so far increases have been generated chiefly by cost-cutting rather than strong sales, analysts said.
"The reason profits are doing so well is because employment is being held down," said the economist Laurence H. Meyer. "The question is: Can you continue to earn profits if that doesn't generate increases in employment? The answer is: No.'
 
A Worrisome Turn
 Although second-quarter G.D.P. growth was unchanged from the estimate announced last month, its composition took a worrisome turn, economists said. More of the growth than first thought came from an accumulation of inventories, and the nation's trade performance proved to be a bigger negative than initially believed.
The larger inventory buildup could reduce the need for production in the third quarter, detracting from growth. And now Hurricane Andrew looks as if it will depress the third-quarter figures as well.
Many analysts are looking for third-quarter results similar to the second quarter and do not foresee a pickup until late in the year, too late to benefit President Bush's re-election effort.
The nation's unemployment rate, at 7.7 percent in July, just off its eight-year peak of 7.8 percent, will probably not improve more than slightly, they said.
"Later in the year, growth could pick up and be sustained into 1993," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch. "But Bush won't get any help from that. No one is going to notice before the election that any improvement is taking place in the economy."
The second quarter marked the 13th consecutive quarter of subpar growth or outright decline in the G.D.P. Although the last five quarters have been positive, the expansion has not been strong enough to provide any substantial number of jobs for the growing labor force.

HEADLINE: A Risky Stance on the Falling Dollar

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The sharp slide of the value of the United States dollar to all-time lows recently is an alarm bell going off in the world's currency markets. But in Washington, no one seems to be listening.
With the American economy weak and a Presidential race in its homestretch, the Federal Reserve Board and the Bush Administration want to avoid raising interest rates. An increase in rates would prop up the dollar, but also raise the cost of borrowing on everything from business loans to home mortgages. 
 Still, a dollar policy of benign neglect is risky. The dollar has steadied in nervous trading in the last three days, and the stock market has rallied somewhat in sympathy. But currency traders warn that the forces behind the dollar's fall remain, notably the big gap in policies between the United States, where policy makers want low interest rates to encourage growth, and Germany, where they worry about inflation and keep rates high.
The value of the American currency has dropped some 16 percent in four months against the German mark, the linchpin European currency, with three percentage points of the shrinkage in the last two weeks. An unchecked free fall of the dollar could touch off a panicky crash in stock markets, similar to those of 1987, and hurt economic growth worldwide.
"The situation is very fragile right now, and any bit of bad news could send the dollar tumbling," said C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury official in the Carter Administration, who is the director of the Institute for International Economics. "The Administration and the Fed ought to be terrified. They're flirting with disaster."
Yet short of disaster, the fate of the dollar affects far fewer Americans, in a less immediate way, than interest rate movements. "The votes are in lower interest rates," said David Wyss, chief financial economist for DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.
Many homeowners, for example, have benefited from the repeated lowering of interest rates by the Fed in the last two years as it has tried to revive the sluggish economy. In 1989, homeowners in their late 30's and early 40's, the peak mortgage-paying age, paid an average of $4,000 a year in house payments, according to DRI/McGraw-Hill. By this year, the same homeowners, assuming they had floating-rate mortgages or refinanced their fixed-payment loans, are paying $800 less, or $3,200 a year.
In his Houston speech accepting the Republican nomination last week, President Bush eagerly took credit for the low American rates. "Interest rates are the lowest they've been in 20 years, and millions of Americans have refinanced their homes," he said.
The Federal Reserve, not the Administration, sets monetary policy and American interest rates, and the Fed is an independent body. Yet few analysts believe the Fed is entirely immune to political pressure.
The Banc One Corporation, based in Columbus, Ohio, has refinanced thousands of mortgages at its 1,200 offices in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kentucky and Texas. Its chairman, John B. McCoy, agrees that it is interest rates, not the dollar, that affect most Americans. "The American consumer basically couldn't care less about the dollar," he said.
To be sure, there are exceptions. American tourists traveling abroad have been stunned by how little their dollars buy. More important to the economy, a weak dollar helps American exporters, whose goods are cheap to foreign buyers.
 
Help for Exports
 Since the dollar peak of 1985, the fairly steady decline in the value of the American currency has aided exports considerably, with merchandise exports nearly doubling in five years, to $422 billion last year. Since 1989, the lift from surging sales of exports of both goods and services more than accounted for all the growth in the American economy, estimates Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. In short, without exports there would have been no growth at all during the Bush years.
The Hurco Companies has seen the overseas sales of its specialized machine tools more than double in five years to $43 million last year, representing roughly half of the Indianapolis company's business. "A low dollar helps you break into foreign markets against formidable competition," said Brian McLaughlin, Hurco's president. "And if the dollar goes a bit lower, as a U.S. manufacturing exporter, that's fine with me."
But the recent slide in the dollar's value, economists agree, will not help the American economy in the form of increased export sales for six to nine months, well after the November election, given the usual lag between currency-driven price changes and additional foreign orders.
 
Rate Changes Felt Quickly
 The effects of interest-rate movements, however, are felt in the domestic economy more quickly in the form of payments made by businesses and consumers on the money they borrow.
The pressure to raise American rates is not home-grown. Inflation is low in the soft economy, so there is little danger that a weak dollar, which makes imported goods more costly, poses an inflationary threat anytime soon.
Instead, the pressure on the dollar, and American rates, comes from Germany. Specifically, it is the gap between high German rates and the low American rates that makes buying the mark and selling the dollar such an attractive bargain for currency traders.
Like the policy makers in Washington, the Germans are focused on domestic pressures. The steep costs of German unification have fueled Government spending and inflation in a country whose bankers and Government officials, recalling the hyperinflation of the 1920's and the period immediately after World War II, have a visceral antagonism toward inflation. The Bundesbank, the German central bank, has raised rates, despite protests from other industrial nations, which want lower rates to stimulate growth.
 
Germany Cannot Be Ignored
 But in an increasingly interwoven global economy, the policies of a unified Germany, the economic giant of Europe, cannot be ignored. The impact is most severe in Europe, where the currencies of Britain, France and other nations are directly linked to the German mark via the European Monetary System.
But as the sobering slide of the dollar shows, the pressures are mounting in Washington as well. "This, in many ways, is a sign of the new world order -- a shock imposed on the U.S. economy by Germany," said Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.

EXXON'S PRESIDENT AND OTHER OFFICERS SELL SHARES

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation's president, Lee Raymond, sold 45,999, or 43 percent, of his shares in the Irving, Tex., oil giant. Mr. Raymond sold the shares Aug. 5 for $64.76 each and now holds 59,627 shares. In addition, other company officials sold about 151,000 shares in the last month for $55 to $64.76 each, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. The sales come as Exxon stock has reached highs and as falling United States interest rates have weakened the dollar and driven overseas operating expenses up. This could push down earnings for an international company like Exxon. "The stock price by some people's standards is close to the asset valuation," said Benjamin Rice, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Exxon officials declined to comment.

Last Auto Factory in Southern California Closed by G.M.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 27

 BODY:
A red Chevrolet Camaro Z-28 rolled off the line today to end 45 years of production at the General Motors Corporation's Van Nuys plant, the last auto factory in the world's biggest car market.
Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds that once rolled out in huge numbers -- 257,000 were built in 1978 by 5,100 workers -- will now be assembled near Montreal. Canada's national health-care system reduces the price per car by $600 to $800 in lower benefit costs, said Raymond Knudson, a union official. 
 The closing, eliminating 2,600 jobs, is another blow to manufacturing employment in Southern California. The area, once rich in high-paying factory and construction work, has been buffeted by military cutbacks, business flight from high costs and a building-industry recession.
This shutdown was more bitter than most, ending auto building in a region where 14 million people are bound to their cars by lack of public transit, the far-flung freeways and a personal devotion matched nowhere else.
It also ended years of uncertainty at the aging plant, where parts of the roof were unsafe to walk, water pipes regularly burst, and morale had flagged since a 1980's battle over Japanese manufacturing techniques that cut job classifications from 170 to 2: team member and team leader.
In the 1960's, G.M. had a second Los Angeles-area factory, building Buicks, Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles in South Gate. Nearby, Fords were built in Pico Rivera, Chryslers in Commerce.
Then, British and German workers flocked to skilled trade jobs at local auto plants. Managers looked the other way as illegal aliens from Mexico took dirty jobs, Mr. Knudson said.
Now it takes two salaries to buy a condominium, and the state's only car factory is near San Francisco, a joint venture of G.M. and Toyota where the Corollas and Geo Prisms are the result of strict Japanese-style team-concept production.
Mr. Knudson said workers who had made $18 an hour are looking at $8-an-hour jobs fixing air conditioners or cars.
Under their contract with G.M., employees who return to school will get full pay and benefits through September 1993; pay is 85 percent for those who do not seek retraining.
They also can get on the hiring lists for G.M. plants in other states. Mr. Knudson said skilled workers should find work fairly quickly, but it could take years for assembly line workers.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Yield Falls Slightly

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Treasury market did not go far yesterday as it got a dose of perplexing economic news and a small rally in the dollar faded by the end of the day.
But the market got a last-minute lift, just as many traders were heading home, when the Federal Reserve reported that two key measures of the nation's money supply grew much less than expected in the week ending Aug. 17. 
 In late trading in the secondary market, the 7.25 percent 30-year Treasury bond was offered at 98 7/32, up 6/32, to yield 7.39 percent, compared with 7.41 percent on Wednesday.
But trading was still generally thin and indecisive, and that did not help the Wall Street firms that underwrote the $1 billion in Tennessee Valley Authority three-year notes, which were moving sluggishly.
The money supply numbers showed a $1.5 billion decline in M-2, which includes currency in circulation, checking accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit, and a $1 billion rise in M-3, which includes M-2 and money market accounts.
 
Money Supply Sluggish
 Ward McCarthy, a managing director with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., said that M-2 had been expected to rise $3 billion to $4 billion and M-3 had been expected to rise more than $1 billion. He said the current figures left the Federal Reserve $24 billion below the bottom of its money-supply growth targets for the year.
At the end of a day with little action, the report may have made some traders just react instinctively and buy on data that reflect a slow economy and would normally spur speculation on another easing of rates by the Fed.
But with the dollar hovering just above its record low against the German mark, the Fed's hands may be tied in the near term because cutting rates here would weaken the dollar further. So the money supply data may not be as supportive, for now, as they seemed late yesterday.
Two other economic reports may have held the market back a little yesterday because they gave some signs, albeit weak ones, that the economy may just have a tiny bit more oomph in it. But with the economy moving so slowly a little bit of lift does not mean that much.
One report showed a rise in the Mortgage Bankers Association indexes of mortgage applications and new purchases. And the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment compensation dropped 92,000 to 382,000 in the week ending Aug. 15. That was the largest drop since the survey began in 1967 and the first time that the number of new claimants has fallen below 400,000 since October 1990. But these numbers were distorted by the return of furloughed workers to General Motors plants in Michigan.
 
Corporate Bonds
 The Tennessee Valley Authority sold $1 billion in three-year notes yesterday that will reduce its interest costs and add some flexibility to its financial planning.
The new three-year 4.75 percent notes were priced to the public to yield 4.88 percent, 15 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the yield on three-year Treasury notes. They will be used to retire an existing $1 billion in five-year bonds sold in 1998. They have an 8.25 percent coupon and mature on Oct. 1. 1994.
Although those bonds are not callable for refinancing, the T.V.A. can effectively retire them from their books by establishing a trust from the proceeds of the new note sale. The cash is used to buy enough two-year Treasury securities to cover the principal and interest due on the old five-year notes.
William F. Malec, the chief financial officer of the T.V.A., said the new deal would save $2 million a year in interest expenses. In addition, the new three-year bonds are callable after one year, so the T.V.A. has some additional flexibility if interest rates do move lower over the next several years.
But while the sale was good for the T.V.A., traders involved said it was not going well for the underwriters. While the first few notes sold quickly, a trader said "they have gone very slowly this afternoon" because investors are not comfortable with the volatility in the market right now.
 
Foreign Bonds
 In foreign bond markets, a small rebound was also erased when the dollar gave up some earlier gains. In addition, a rumor in the bond markets that the Italian Government was going to raise its official interest rates to defend the weakening lira knocked the British pound lower and pulled down bonds in London.
The 10-year bond future in London was down about a half a point as the rumor of an Italian rate increase made one seem more likely in Britain, since its currency is also near the bottom of its trading range in the European Monetary System. In France, a rally of a quarter to a half of a point was wiped out and the 10-year bond future finished unchanged.
The Italian Government denied that it was considering a rate increase to defend its weak currency. And the French Finance Minister said the French were not considering any realignment in the European Monetary System. But these comments did not provide much comfort. Investors are worried that the French will reject the Maastricht Treaty in a Sept. 20 referendum. The treaty outlines the steps to a single currency by the end of the century and rejection by the French would create chaos in European financial markets.

HEADLINE: Dollar and Foreign Stocks Help Dow Advance by 7.83

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices rode out a wave of afternoon selling to post a moderate gain yesterday, encouraged by a stronger dollar and upswings in overseas markets.
Building-related stocks with interests in Florida were some of the day's standout performers in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. 
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 25 points at its peak during the day, closed with a gain of 7.83, to 3,254.64.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume came to 178.6 million shares, up from 171.9 million in the previous session.
 
Some Losses Recouped
 The dollar rose in foreign exchange trading, recouping some of the losses it had suffered lately amid worries about the American economic and political outlook.
Analysts said that helped to ease fears that the Federal Reserve might be forced to shift toward a more restrictive credit policy in defense of the dollar.
Stock prices also climbed in the major foreign markets, reversing a recent slide that had unsettled Wall Street.
Home building and construction materials stocks drew buying interest from traders anticipating a major rebuilding effort in Florida after this week's hurricane caused billions of dollars in damages.
Home Depot, operator of building-supply and home-improvement stores, climbed 1 1/2, to 52 1/4; Lennar, a residential-community developer, gained 1 3/4, to 30 1/8; Elcor, which makes roofing shingles, rose 1 3/8, to 11 1/4, and Hughes Supply, a distributor of construction materials, added 1 1/8, to 14 3/8.
Home Depot said it had been holding the line on lumber prices in South Florida in the face of heavy customer demand and sharp increases in wholesale prices.
 
Home Maker Rises
 Fleetwood Enterprises, a producer of manufactured housing, rose 1 1/4, to 30 7/8. The stock jumped 3 1/4 points Wednesday after the company reported a bigger-than-expected earnings gain for the fiscal first quarter that ended July 26.
Elsewhere yesterday, Philip Morris, which announced a dividend increase on Wednesday, gained 5/8, to 81 1/4, in active trading.
Other blue chips contributing to the Dow's rise were Walt Disney, up 1/2 at 34 3/8; Allied-Signal, up 1 1/8 at 53 5/8; International Business Machines, up 1 at 87 3/8, and J. P. Morgan, up 3/8 at 59 3/4.
Auto issues, by contrast, came under renewed pressure amid worries about economic-recovery prospects. General Motors, whose operations may be hurt by a strike at a metal fabricating plant, lost 3/8, to 33 3/4; Ford Motor slipped 1/8, to 40 3/8, and Chrysler dropped 1/8, to 19 1/2.
Among leading technology stocks in the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, Microsoft gained 2, to 73 5/8; Novell 1 1/4, to 50 3/4; Intel 3/4, to 57 3/4; Adobe Systems 1 1/8, to 33 1/4, and Seagate Technology 3/8, to 13 5/8.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.47, to 563.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up 1.35 at 381.00.

Dollar Ends Slightly Higher On Mixed Data on Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly higher against the German mark and most other currencies yesterday after Government reports provided mixed news on the economy's health. Gold prices rose.
"The dollar had a little bit of a good tone to it this morning when the jobless claims data came out, but it drifted off as the day went on," said Joe Volpicella, chief currency trader at the Westpac Banking Corporation in New York. 
 The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment fell 92,000, to 382,000, in the week ending Aug. 15, the Labor Department said yesterday.
A separate report that the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, rose at only a 1.4 percent annual pace, softened the dollar, traders said.
In New York, the dollar closed at 1.4085 marks, up from 1.4065 on Wednesday. In Europe, the dollar rose as high as 1.4190 marks before easing to 1.4110 marks late in the day. This compared with 1.4070 marks late Wednesday in Europe.
Earlier this week, the dollar hit a new closing low of 1.4015 marks in New York. Low interest rates and a sluggish economy have discouraged investment in the dollar.
Traders said the dollar was supported yesterday by a statement by Economics Minister Michel Sapin of France that the Group of Seven industrialized nations did not want the dollar to weaken further.
Meanwhile, Germany's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, said Germany needed lower interest rates, and that statement began some weakening in the mark, easing pressure on the dollar and European currencies.
In New York, the British pound closed at $1.9800, down from $1.9860 on Wednesday. In London, the pound was quoted at $1.9770, down from $1.9865 late Wednesday.
In New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 124.75 Japanese yen, down from 124.85 late Wednesday. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.95 yen, unchanged from Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 124.85 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.2605 Swiss francs, up from 1.2580; 4.8015 French francs, up from 4.7950; 1,077.00 Italian lire, up from 1,074.50, and 1.19575 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19175.

International
Japan announced the largest economic rescue package in its history. Public works spending is to be doubled to $86 billion to stimulate growth. The plan is also intended to strengthen a banking system that has been jeopardized by falling land and stock prices. The market soared in response. [Page 1.]

HEADLINE: Dow Is Up for a 4th Day, Rising 12.97

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks drifted higher yesterday, extending the recovery from last week's sharp selloff to four straight sessions.
A steady dollar in the last few days lent support to the stock market, which began retreating last week when it fell to record lows against the German mark. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed 12.97 points higher at 3,267.61. Stocks that rose outnumbered losers by 955 to 749 on the New York Stock Exchange. For the week, the Dow gained 13.51 points.
Volume was only 152.3 million shares, compared with 178.6 million shares on Thursday.
"I think the stability in the foreign exchange markets has helped the stock market in the last three days recover some, but it's a very tentative recovery," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation.
 The dollar closed at 1.4090 marks, little changed from the Thursday close of 1.4085.
Analysts said a rally in Japanese stocks gave Wall Street a sense of relief. Shares jumped 2.37 percent yesterday in Tokyo, and were up 11 percent for the week.
The Japanese Government approved the largest fiscal spending package since World War II yesterday to try to jolt the economy back to life. The package, which followed months of talks on how to end the economic slowdown, amounts to an injection of $86 billion into the economy. The Tokyo stock market has embraced the package.
"The continued rally in Tokyo has lessened people's fears for the short-term of any meltdown," said Bradley Turner, chairman of the investment policy committee at McDonald & Company.
Still, there were persistent worries about the course of the economy and the Presidential election.
 Mr. Turner said, "On any given day, the dollar may play a role, but I think that from now through the end of the third quarter, the focus is largely going to be on politics."
With Gov. Bill Clinton and President Bush in a close race, it is far from certain what economic policy will take shape after the November election. In the meantime, Wall Street is keeping a close watch.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks closed up 1.31 points at 414.84. The American Stock Exchange index gained 0.18, to 381.18.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index closed up 0.70 point at 228.43. The average share gained 11 cents.
The Nasdaq index gained 0.29 at 563.56. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of Big Board, American and over-the-counter issues -- was up 11.74, or three-tenths of a percent, to 3,991.83.

HEADLINE: Consumer Groups Attack Regulations Freeze

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
In a joint report, two public-interest groups have strongly disputed the Bush Administration's statement that up to $20 billion will be saved under its current moratorium on new regulations.
"The Administration's claims of cost savings to the economy are pure voodoo accounting," Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, said in issuing the report on Thursday. Public Citizen, founded by the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, worked on the report with O.M.B. Watch, a group that monitors the White House Office of Management and Budget. 
 Rather than saving money, the report said, the moratorium has damaged the public health and the environment. More than 75 regulations have been halted or weakened by the moratorium.
The White House has said that $15 billion to $20 billion has been saved in the first eight months of the moratorium, an estimate, it said, that was taken from figures submitted by two dozen Federal agencies.
"We stand by that number," said Jeffrey A. Nesbit, a spokesman for Vice President Dan Quayle. Mr. Quayle heads the White House Council on Competitiveness, which administers the effort to curb regulations.
The President declared a moratorium on all new regulations in January, making exceptions only for those rules deemed necessary because of imminent danger to the public health or those required by deadlines set in law.

HEADLINE: One-Fisted Strength on China

 BODY:
Whether the issue is intellectual property rights or intellectuals jailed for their beliefs, the same facts apply. The U.S. has vast trade leverage with China and can use it to induce better Chinese behavior.
The Bush Administration now threatens China with sweeping tariff penalties for trade infractions. But at the same time, indifferent to the obvious contradiction, it insists that linking tariff penalties to human rights would jeopardize reform and hurt the wrong Chinese. The Administration cannot, honorably, have things both ways. 
 U.S. trade negotiators are right to warn Beijing that "we cannot let a country with this level of trade play by its own rules." Among the infractions cited are outright bans and quotas, discriminatory licensing requirements and failure to publish relevant laws and regulations. The Administration has given China until Oct. 10 to open its markets or face 100 percent tariffs on $4 billion of imports, including shoes, silks, luggage and electronic goods.
The express goal of this ultimatum is not to stop trade but to push Beijing into timely concessions. Last year, similar U.S. pressure worked; China agreed to respect intellectual property rights like patents and copyrights. Why does the Administration find such pressure unacceptable when directed at political prisoners, respect for human rights conventions and honoring arms agreements?
A bill overwhelmingly passed by the House and now pending in the Senate would make China's access to low tariffs conditional on "significant progress" in these areas. Noncompliance would bring tariff increases only for products of state industry, sensibly shielding the budding entrepreneurial sector.
Incredibly, the Administration threatens to veto this bill on principle. What principle? The only difference between the trade ultimatum and the human rights legislation is which goals the U.S. hopes to achieve. In fact, many see the Administration's trade stance as designed to draw Senate votes away from the human rights bill by flaunting toughness on economic issues.
Under normal circumstances, trade legislation should not be a vehicle for routine political concerns. But China is already in a special statutory category because of its Communist system and emigration restrictions. Gross violations of international rights standards are not routine politics.
The sad truth seems to be that the Bush Administration is prepared to lean hard on China where dollars and cents are concerned, but on human rights it doesn't care enough to try.

'This Is Our Land' Has Angola Astir

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CACUACO, Angola, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The problem is simple, Jonas Savimbi told supporters at a rally here recently. For four centuries foreigners have ruled Angola -- first its Portuguese colonizers, then Soviet military advisers and eventually soldiers from Cuba, who backed the ruling party in this country's brutal 16-year-long civil war.
When he becomes President, Mr. Savimbi promised, Angola will be ruled by Angolans. 
 A month before Angolans vote in this country's first multiparty elections, Mr. Savimbi, the leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, has made the anti-foreigner message a central theme in his presidential campaign.
The message is deceptive in its simplicity, political analysts here say, and has potentially explosive implications in a continent where tribal and racial tensions across artificial frontiers haunt many governments. "Every foreigner who comes to occupy Angola will be fought against," the former guerrilla fighter told the 10,000 to 15,000 people who had gathered in a dusty square to hear him speak.
 
Hypocrisy, Opponents Say
 "People get upset," he acknowledged, when he insists that "Angolans must come first, second and third."
But he said that those who feel that way are "outsiders" who are mainly concerned with maintaining their tight economic and political grip on the country. Those days will soon be over, Mr. Savimbi asserted.
The issue has focused attention on how the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola brought in tens of thousands of Soviets and Cubans to help them hold power after Portugal granted its African colonies independence in 1975.
But supporters of the ruling party accuse Mr. Savimbi of hypocrisy because he eagerly sought the support of foreigners -- namely the United States and South Africa -- in his guerrilla war against the Luanda Government. And when Mr. Savimbi talks about the future role of "foreigners" in Angola, many political analysts and Western diplomats here say he is also alluding to Angola's large Portuguese and mixed-race population.
"Savimbi considers anyone who isn't a pure African a foreigner," said a young Angolan businessman whose father is Portuguese and his mother Angolan. "This is a very frightening time here."
Venacio de Moura, the Deputy Foreign Minister and one of the country's most seasoned politicians, declared that Mr. Savimbi was "a racist and a tribalist." Mr. de Moura added that he knew of Portuguese and mixed-raced families, many of whom have spent decades in Angola before and during the civil war, who had fled the country because they feared a pogrom if Mr. Savimbi won.
 
'His Worst Enemy'
 A Western political consultant who has advised both the Angolan Government and opposition parties about the elections said that Mr. Savimbi's fiery nationalism had alienated many better-educated urban voters who might have felt tempted to vote for change. "Savimbi is proving to be his worst enemy in this campaign," the consultant said.
Savimbi aides say there is nothing threatening about his message. Those who have found a racist or tribalist meaning in Mr. Savimbi's campaign declarations have "a guilty conscience," said Jardo Mulekalia, Unita's chief Washington representative.
"We have said time and time again that we consider anybody who was born here, whether white or black, Angolan," Mr. Mulekalia said. "If they feel that by referring only to Angolans we only mean black, then that's their problem."
Unita officials are quick to point to the ethnically and racially broad range of Mr. Savimbi's senior advisers. The core group is drawn mainly from Mr. Savimbi's ethnic group, the Ovimbundu, who come from Angola's mostly rural and agrarian central highlands, but they also consist of people from the Kimbundu and Luanda-Chowde groups in the northeast, the Bakongo in the northwest and a number of Portuguese.
Mr. Savimbi himself made a similar point at a recent rally in Baia Farta. "I would like to stress here that foreigners who want to come and work in Angola in order to develop this country are welcome," he told the crowd. But then he warned: "We do not want, however, people coming here to enslave us. This is our land."
 
The Message Is Clear
 The debate hinges in part on the personality and style of Mr. Savimbi himself. While professing that he is a staunch believer in the democratic process, the goateed 57-year-old rebel leader has often been accused of having an authoritarian streak and of encouraging a cult of personality.
Another reason that Mr. Savimbi's anti-foreigner theme has caused such a stir is that many Angolans feel that the upper levels of the ruling party are disproportionally filled with mixed-race Angolans, or mesticos as they are called in Portuguese.
Whether Mr. Savimbi is intentionally trying to foment dissent among Angola's ethnic and racial groups is open to dispute. What is clear, however, is that many people have no trouble understanding the message.
A businessman of Portuguese ancestry recently recalled sitting in a restaurant when a group of Unita soldiers struck up a conversation.
"They weren't hostile or anything like that," the businessman said, "but after we had a couple of drinks, they said -- and it was said in a casual and non-threatening tone -- that people like me were no longer going to control this country when Savimbi takes over."

HEADLINE: Daniel Ludwig, Billionaire Businessman, Dies at 95

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Daniel K. Ludwig, the self-made American shipowner and real estate man who was for years one of the world's richest men, died Thursday afternoon at his midtown Manhattan apartment. He was 95 years old.
The cause of his death was heart failure, and he had been in poor health for several years, said R. Palmer Baker Jr., a lawyer who is Mr. Ludwig's executor. 
 Mr. Baker said Mr. Ludwig had owned about 60 ocean-going vessels years ago, at the height of his shipping career. He said that over the years, Mr. Ludwig was also "a major participant on an international scale in the production of forest products, oil and gas, coal and other minerals, in hotels and other real estate development programs, and in a number of cattle-ranching and agricultural ventures."
The son of a Michigan real-estate man, Mr. Ludwig was best known in his later years for his unsuccessful billion-dollar development project in a Brazilian jungle enclave the size of Connecticut. In 1982 he made arrangements to give it up after problems that included Brazilian nationalism and bureaucracy and his own volatile executive style. Mr. Baker said Mr. Ludwig retained no land holdings in Brazil at the time of his death.
Mr. Ludwig (pronounced LUDD-wig) was secretive and had assets that were difficult to appraise. Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $1.2 billion late last year, but the current issue of Fortune magazine does not include him on a list of billionaires. In the early 1970's he gave "substantially all" of his foreign assets to the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Zurich, Mr. Baker said.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Baker said the current endowment of the institute was about $700 million. Asked what Mr. Ludwig's own net worth was, Mr. Baker declined to reply, but he said Mr. Ludwig's holdings in the United States at the time of his death included a substantial amount of real estate. He declined to elaborate, but he said Mr. Ludwig had no posts in any companies or charitable organization.
 
Shipping Empire Built on Credit
 New York businessmen familiar with Mr. Ludwig's holdings said that in the summer of 1990 ill health had left him incapacitated. They said parts of his business empire had been sold off, with the proceeds going to the cancer institute.
In earlier decades, Mr. Ludwig built a huge shipping empire mainly on credit, then embarked on a variety of large-scale, long-term undertakings, lavishly investing the cash earned by his ships and using them as collateral for more loans. His interests extended to more than a score of countries.
Mr. Ludwig went into shipping at the age of 19, using a borrowed $5,000. In 1968, when he was 71, Fortune magazine said he was one of eight Americans worth $500 million or more, and in 1976 the magazine said he and the insurance executive John D. MacArthur were the country's only billionaires or near-billionaires.
Mr. Ludwig's epic Brazilian development project, known as Jari, was in an isolated inland enclave in the Amazon region in the north of the country. He bought the jungle-covered land for $3 million in 1967, planning to reforest much of it with fast-growing Burmese melina trees to meet a world fiber shortage that he -- correctly -- thought was coming in the 1970's and 1980's.
The project, whose operations ranged from forestry and agriculture to mining and cattle-ranching, drew criticism from conservationists. .
But Mr. Ludwig and the foreign experts he brought in persevered, bulldozing existing forest, tapping deposits of kaolin and bauxite and building a 26-mile railroad, 3,000 miles of trails and roads and settlements that had 30,000 inhabitants by early 1982. Equipment imported to the enclave included a $200 million pulp mill.
Eventually, after more than a decade, Mr. Ludwig warned a Brazilian Government leader, Gen. Golbery do Couto e Silva, that he would close Jari if the Government did not ease stubborn bureaucratic problems he was facing, and provide him with financial relief.
The Brazilian leadership withheld the aid Mr. Ludwig sought, and he eventually set about abandoning Jari. His failing health was officially given as the reason.
 
$863 Million Gamble Showed Philosophy
 By early 1982 an arrangement had been worked out whereby a Brazilian state commercial bank, the Banco do Brazil, other companies and a Brazilian industrialist, Augusto Azevedo Antunes, were to come up with $280 million by the mid-1980's to take over the project. A new Jari company was to be formed, and its prospectus reported that Mr. Ludwig had invested $863 million in the undertaking since buying the land. The prospectus said his outlay had been the equivalent of $1.15 billion at 1981 prices.
That colossal, unsuccessful gamble by Mr. Ludwig reflected some of the same qualities that made him so extraordinarily successful in other enterprises: his tireless entrepreneurial drive -- he started his first business venture when he was 9 years old -- coupled with an unusual amount of imagination and foresight and with the constant use of what he called his antennae for sensing a potential profit.
"Nearly everyone has those antennae; most people just don't use them," he once told an interviewer. "I spend my time putting projects together."
For decades Mr. Ludwig's main corporate vehicle was a New York-based shipping concern, National Bulk Carriers Inc., which he owned outright and built into one of the world's largest private multinational corporations. The corporation once said in a brochure that it had more than 20,000 employees and "several billion dollars in assets."
But the businessmen familiar with Mr. Ludwig's holdings said in 1990 that the interests and operations of National Bulk Carriers had very greatly diminished. And Forbes magazine reported in October 1990 that his shipping interests had been permitted to dwindle.
Mr. Ludwig emphasized patience, discernment and creativity in his business affairs. "We may look at 20 possible ventures before we find one that suits our thinking," he once told an interviewer. "The raw materials of a deal, before it is assembled, look very different from the final arrangement."
In the 1940's a process for welding rather than riveting tankers was developed at a Virginia shipyard that Mr. Ludwig ran, and in the 1950's he went into shipbuilding in Japan to take advantage of low labor costs and other favorable conditions. There he turned out a succession of bulk carriers and ever-larger tankers, pioneering the development of what came to be known as the supertanker.
 
Hard Businessman, Casual Stroller
 Mr. Ludwig concentrated on his business and was casual and unpretentious about much of the rest his life.
A tall, lean man with a pronounced stoop, he used to be seen strolling in midtown Manhattan. He wore the same plastic raincoat for years. He liked to lunch in midtown restaurants, often alone. He used to make and receive many telephone calls himself. He often flew economy class. And for recreation he liked to watch television reruns of old movies starring his friend Clark Gable.
"Clark was all man," he once recalled crustily. "He stood head and shoulders above all those two-bit phonies in Hollywood today."
Mr. Ludwig was often profane and short-tempered in his business dealings. In 1938, after he made indirect use of one of his ships as security for a loan, the vessel went astray in a hurricane. When a worried banker called and asked, "How's my collateral?" Mr. Ludwig said, "When we find the goddamn thing I'll let you know."
And in the 1950's, cables used to arrive at the Ludwig shipyard offices in Japan with such blunt messages as: "Mr. Ludwig wants to know what the hell is holding you up."
Despite his crustiness, Mr. Ludwig was firmly loyal to some old associates. "I like to do business with friends," he told an interviewer in 1957. "Why the hell should I deal with somebody who isn't my friend?"
Mr. Ludwig was an economic conservative, and some of his famous friends and acquaintances were on the conservative side. They included Richard M. Nixon, whom Mr. Ludwig and his second wife, Gertrude Virginia Ludwig, had to dinner before he became President, and Ronald Reagan, whose photograph was said to be displayed in Mr. Ludwig's apartment.
 
Early Investment In a Sunken Boat
 Boating and shipping were in Daniel Keith Ludwig's blood. Four uncles were captains of vessels plying the Great Lakes, and he was born, on June 24, 1897, on the shore of Lake Michigan, in the little port of South Haven, Mich., near the site of a local landmark, Ludwig's Pier. It had been built by his grandfather.
As a 9-year-old boy, the story goes, Daniel Ludwig earned money by selling popcorn and shining shoes, and he paid $75 for a sunken small boat that he then repaired and rented out for more than $150.
He left school after the eighth grade, became a salesman for a ship supplies firm, went to night school and worked for a time at a marine engine manufacturing company.
It was then, at the age of 19, that Mr. Ludwig went into business on his own, using the $5,000, which had been borrowed mainly on his father's signature. He spent the money on an old paddle steamer, converted it into a barge and used it as the nucleus for a fleet of freight vessels, which he used for hauling molasses and wood. But business was slow and he looked around for ways to improve it.
"I had to hit on something or I was busted," he later recalled.
He went into the tanker business, starting by chartering a single tanker. In 1926, he hurt his back badly in an explosion on board a tanker. Undaunted by the years of pain that followed, he persisted in the shipping business.
During the 1930's, despite the Depression, Mr. Ludwig managed to expand his operations. A watershed in his career was a 1936 Chemical Bank loan. He used it to buy several freight vessels that he made over into tankers, substantially expanding his operations.
 
Extended Holdings Beyond Shipping
 By the end of World War II, Mr. Ludwig was the owner of the United States' fifth-largest tanker fleet. He set about building more and bigger tankers at the shipyard he leased in 1951 in the naval base city of Kure in southwestern Japan.
In the 1960's, having become one of the richest shipowners, he began branching out into many other fields, and by the mid-1970's, his interests included the United Pocahontas Coal Company in West Virginia, with an annual output of a million tons of low-sulfur, high-grade coal; mining in Australia (in 1976 he sold half a coal mine there to British Petroleum for $200 million); savings and loan associations; half-interest in an Australian insurance company, and a private merchant banking firm, European-American Securities Inc.
In October 1990, Forbes magazine reported that Mr. Ludwig's investments had included several savings and loan associations that it said were then operated by Resolution Trust. Forbes also said a large-scale development undertaking by Mr. Ludwig in New Jersey had become "stalled."
Mr. Ludwig was divorced in 1937 from his first wife, Gladys Madeline Ludwig, after 9 years of marriage, a biographer of Mr. Ludwig, Jerry Shields, wrote in a 1986 book, "The Invisible Billionaire: Daniel Ludwig." Mr. Ludwig married his second wife later in 1937.
Mr. Ludwig's executor, Mr. Baker, said the businessman's only survivor was his wife.
Mr. Baker said a daughter, Patricia Ludwig, was born to Mr. Ludwig's first wife during the marriage and survives, but that Mr. Ludwig did not acknowledge her as his child.

HEADLINE: 45 Are Charged In Drug Fraud Of Medicaid

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
In what Federal officials said was the largest number of Medicaid-fraud indictments ever filed in New York State, 45 people have been charged by a Federal grand jury in Manhattan with the illegal sale and redistribution of prescription drugs.
The indictments against 3 ringleaders, 32 pharmacists and 10 other defendants were filed on Thursday and announced yesterday by Otto G. Obermaier, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The 45 defendants were among 69 people arrested in raids conducted throughout the New York City metropolitan region on June 30 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 Thirteen pharmacies were closed and 46 searched in what the F.B.I. said was part of a national crackdown on the criminal diversion of prescription drugs for illicit sale on the streets and resale to drug stores.
Federal officials described a black market in which Medicaid recipients, whose medications are paid for by the state and Federal government, sold their prescriptions or the drugs to distributors, who would sell them back to druggists with large Medicaid clienteles at reduced prices.
Stanley Jacobson, of Northport, L.I., who was charged with being a ringleader, was said by prosecutors to have kept such a large inventory of the diverted drugs in a warehouse in Farmingdale, L.I., that he needed a computer to keep track of them.
Two others, Martin Bobb, of Port Jefferson, L.I., and Donald Solof, of Howard Beach, Queens, were said by prosecutors "to have amassed enormous wealth from the scheme, including a private airplane, an ambulette business, a real estate business, numerous bank accounts and substantial quantities of cash."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Senate Race;
In Bible Belt, Underdog Runs On Backing Abortion Rights

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, Aug. 25

 BODY:
For the Bible Belt, it was a political caricature from hell: Steve Lewis, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, distributing bumper stickers from the window of an abortion clinic.
In a normal election year that would not be the cartoon image a politician wants to see in The Daily Oklahoman, the largest-circulation newspaper in a state where religion often mixes with politics like barbecue and beans. 
 But running at least 25 points behind in the polls against Senator Don Nickles, the far better financed two-term Republican incumbent, Mr. Lewis has little to lose by striking out on the risky strategy of featuring his support for abortion rights.
He is trying to use the most controversial of family issues to drive a wedge between Mr. Nickles and the voters. The tactic could easily backfire by November, however, and even some of Mr. Lewis's own campaign workers admit they are afraid that will happen.
Some out-of-state abortion-rights advocates have expressed concern that the race could become viewed nationally as a referendum on the issue, a problem for them because Oklahoma is a state where their advocates are not nearly as well organized as the Christian fundamentalist right.
"It's a definitional issue that helps define whose side you're on," said Mr. Lewis, 49 years old, who is known around the state for an unsuccessful bid for Governor in 1990.
Mr. Lewis has told voters that unlike Mr. Nickles he would have voted against confirming Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court and that as a Senator he would support only Court nominees who promise to uphold Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
Mr. Nickles became nationally identified with uncompromising opposition to abortion during the Republican National Convention last week, when the platform committee he headed included a plank calling for a constitutional amendment banning all abortions, even in cases of incest and rape.
But the 43-year-old Republican drew notice at home when he decided not to mention the issue at all in a speech presenting the platform before the convention. In its coverage of the first day of the Houston convention, the lead story in the daily Tulsa World noted that Mr. Nickles never mentioned the "A-word" during his speech nor in remarks to the state delegation. The headline of the article read: "Nickles' Speech Shows Party Trying to Mute Abortion Issue."
Mr. Lewis's campaign staff and the Democratic State Committee tried to exploit the impression of uncertainty conveyed by the headline, releasing a flurry of news releases promoting abortion rights during the convention. In a tour of eastern Oklahoma on Saturday, Mr. Lewis proclaimed his support for abortion rights at every campaign event.
Speaking before customers at a restaurant in Ponca City, Mr. Lewis asked, "Are you for Don Nickles having a vote in deciding whether your wife or your daughter has a choice when it comes to a very personal matter of conscience?"
Some customers burst out cheering, but his remarks seemed to cut both ways. "He's talking about choice, but he's not talking about the choice of the child who is destroyed," said Emma Walcher, 66, a retired school teacher and a registered Democrat.
In contrast to his opponent, Mr. Nickles did not mention abortion in two speeches on Friday in Ponca City and Oklahoma City. Instead, he stressed less controversial topics like his desire to cut taxes and regulations on the oil and gas industry.
Local and national Democrats say Mr. Nickles ought to be vulnerable because their surveys show that few voters associate him with any legislative accomplishments. His homespun charm helped him prevail in a tough race six years ago when the Oklahoma economy was weaker than it is today.
Still, in a year when voter discontent has thrown every political certainty into question, the abortion issue has added an unpredictable new twist for Mr. Nickles and the rest of the Republican ticket.
"I'm a registered Republican but I don't feel very Republican these days," said Margaret Johnson, 39, a legal secretary in Oklahoma City. "I'm pro-choice."

HEADLINE: New $100 Million Sensor System To Direct New York Traffic Flow

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
After years of delay, New York City is installing an elaborate and costly system of sensors under its roadways to enable the Transportation Department to monitor congestion, identify trouble spots and control the flow of traffic by quickly changing the duration of red lights.
Spanning a city whose crowded streets and highways often seem to be little more than a gridlocked maze, the sensors and "smart" traffic lights are the major components of a planned $100 million traffic-tracking network. 
 The first phase of the system is to begin operating next summer in Manhattan, transportation officials say. A total of 1,100 electromagnetic sensors are to be embedded in the asphalt of roadways in the borough. The sensors will detect vehicles as they pass over and transmit information on their number, speed and type to a central computer in Long Island City, Queens.
 
Identifying Problems
 Traffic officials will use the data to identify tie-ups from ordinary congestion or from extraordinary events like an accident on the West Side Highway, a water main break in Herald Square or a protest on lower Broadway.
Aided by pictures from 50 closed-circuit television cameras to be mounted on light poles across the borough, the traffic officials will be able to alert traffic agents and the police to help clear the congestion. They will also be able to use the computer to adjust the borough's 3,000 traffic lights to move vehicles from the affected areas and keep others away. Now, the timing and duration of most traffic lights can be changed only at their control boxes on the street -- one at a time.
At least 400 sensors have been installed so far in Manhattan. An estimated 883,000 vehicles enter the borough on an average day.
A traffic-control system similar to that planned for New York is already in use in Los Angeles and Tokyo. Sensors alone are used on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Long Island Expressway. The New York system would be one of the most expensive and elaborate in the world, transportation experts said.
New York's methods of surveying congestion have advanced little since the days of the tail-finned Cadillac, and transportation officials hope that by reducing congestion, the new system will cut pollution and bolster the city's economy. A study by the Texas Transportation Institute of traffic congestion in major metropolitan areas estimated that New York loses $7 billion a year from traffic delays. The study took into account the cost of pollution controls, delays in transporting goods to merchants, accidents and auto insurance.
But some transportation experts and officials warn that the new network relies on advanced technology operating in a city with extremely complex traffic patterns. "These systems are so complicated that they are hard to model in a laboratory," said Anthony F. Hotz, executive director of the Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "There's never ever any real guarantee that the technology is going to work the way you'd like it to."
Others, including the president of the New York City Transit Authority, Alan F. Kiepper, criticize city officials for pumping so much money into a computer system as its roadways continue to deteriorate and financing for mass transit is reduced.
"The biggest problem in New York City," Mr. Kiepper said, "is too many autos and too few highways and underutilized capacity on public transit."
The city's Transportation Department began designing the network, which is financed largely with money from the state and Federal Governments, in the early 1980's. At that time, officials said they expected to have it installed in Manhattan by the late 1980's.
 
Cable Problems
 But Raman K. Patel, chief of systems engineering at the department, said recently that the city scrapped its original plan in the mid-80's after discovering that the cables it had expected to use to link the sensors to the control center would have been unable to transmit enough data. The problem was caught before any contracts had been let so the city had spent relatively little, Mr. Patel said. He could not provide a specific figure.
After that initial delay, the department ran into problems in 1988 when it began embedding the 1,100 sensors and connecting one million feet of underground cable in Manhattan, Mr. Patel said. Each sensor is 36 square feet, and takes two workers 8 to 10 hours to install. A sensor is embedded under each lane at an intersection.
When the network of sensors and "smart" lights is operating in Manhattan, it is also expected to enable engineers to control the traffic lights to increase the speed of inbound traffic during the morning rush and outbound at the end of the workday. The central computer will also feed the data from the vehicle sensors to government agencies and companies that provide traffic reports to radio and television stations. Both have long relied almost exclusively on traffic spotters in helicopters and on drivers and traffic agents on the ground.
"The problem now is that we just don't know enough about the traffic flow," said the Transportation Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio, "This is a way to provide us with far greater information about the use of our roads and bridges. It will enable us to make smarter strategies."
When the sensors detect street congestion, the Transportation Department will be able to intervene directly by manipulating traffic lights. But transportation officials say the system will also assist them greatly in monitoring and controlling traffic on the highways of Manhattan, even though they have no traffic lights. The officials say that when the sensors detect congestion on a roadway like the West Side Highway, they will be able to send traffic agents to clear the tie-up or even close entrances more swiftly than they can now.
After spending $45 million in Manhattan, the city plans to spend $50 to $60 million to expand the network to the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens by 1996, Mr. Patel said. Those three boroughs already have some sensors and some controlled traffic lights, but that system is far more primitive than the one being installed in Manhattan. The city has already installed a small network on Staten Island and does not plan to upgrade it.
Mr. Patel declined to estimate exactly how much the system would reduce congestion or pollution.
"I do not want to speculate," he said. "But we will make an impact across the board."
City officials hope that by the end of the decade, motorists may use computers in their vehicles, homes and offices to tap into the information from the sensors to help them plan the fastest routes around the city.
The department says its new system will help it respond better to crises like the one touched off by the aborted landing and fire aboard a Trans World Airlines jet at Kennedy International Airport during the thick of the evening rush hour on July 30. The incident forced the police to close the Van Wyck Expressway, a major highway in Queens, from Rockaway Boulevard to the airport to allow for passage of emergency vehicles.
 
In the Control Center
 That move caused gridlock on nearby streets and roads and extensive delays that stretched across the city and into Nassau County. At the Transportation Department's nerve center at 40 Worth Street in lower Manhattan, engineers and operators used a maze of computers and radios to monitor traffic and coordinate the city's response.
As radios squawked updates from traffic agents on the road and traffic reporters in the sky, Nelson Castillo, the center's chief of communications operations, pored over a map of southeastern Queens, trying to pinpoint the best routes for channeling traffic away from the Van Wyck and the airport.
The Grand Central Parkway seemed a good candidate for cars, but Mr. Castillo had no way of knowing how congested it was. No traffic agents were nearby and no traffic reporters from radio stations had mentioned the parkway in the last few minutes.
By chance, Leon Heyward, a Transportation Department official, was driving on the Grand Central Parkway, and Mr. Castillo learned from him over the department's radio frequency that congestion was moderate. "If we had the new sensors," Mr. Castillo said, "we could see where the traffic is backed up and how far it is backed up."
Officials in Los Angeles say their system of sensors, which first began operating for the 1984 Summer Olympics, has worked well. The Los Angeles Transportation Department has spent $60 million to install 3,200 sensors linked by computer to 800 traffic signals, said Edwin Rowe, the department's general manager. Downtown Los Angeles receives about half as many vehicles as Manhattan on an average day.


GRAPHIC: A traffic management system that is to be completerd next summer will allow Transportation Department engineers to speed the flow of traffic in Manhattan. Engineers can also control the pacing of traffic lights. That will help them to speed traffic into the city in the mornings and out in the late afternoones. The system is based on a network of electromagnetic sensors under the street. Here is how it would work.
Chart/Diagram: "Transportations: Speeding Up the Flow of Traffic"
Electromagnetic sensors under Fifth Avenue detect that traffic has come to a halt near 19th Street. The Transportation Department uses cameras to determine that a serious accident has occurred. It radios traffic agents to the scene; it also alerts companies that provide traffic reports to radio stations, which then tell motorists to avoid the intersection.
A control center in Long Island City, Queens, increases the duration of green lights on Broadway to speed traffic away from the accident and ensure that the delays do not spread. Traffic control officers direct vehicles to Broadway. (pg. 22)

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Drop on Worries About Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices were mostly lower yesterday in quiet trading.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 11/32 point, or $3.44 cents per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 7.42 percent, from 7.39 percent late Thursday. 
 Some traders sold bonds as the dollar dropped against some foreign currencies after tumbling to record lows earlier in the week.
A decline in the dollar hurts the bond market by decreasing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. A lowering of rates would enhance the value of fixed-income securities like bonds.
 
Acting on Profits
 Yesterday's selling followed a rise in bond prices Thursday, indicating that traders were taking some of their profits.
The market appeared uncertain about the course of the dollar, including whether it would continue to decline and what effect it would have on the economy.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen, while rising slightly against the German mark.
Elliott Platt, research director at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, said the market was affected in early trading by the University of Michigan's consumer confidence report for August. He said traders had anticipated a decline, but the report showed a moderate increase.
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities were unchanged to down 1/32 , intermediate maturities were off by a range of 1/16 to 7/32 , and long-term issues were down 11/32 , the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury bond index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.89, to 1,266.30.
 
Rates on Bills Are Up
 Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 3.22 percent as the discount rose a basis point, to 3.16 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.34 percent as the discount rose a basis point, to 3.25 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 3.45 percent as the discount rose a basis point, to 3.33 percent.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage at which bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 35/16 percent, down from 3 3/8 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 97 3/8, up 3/32 . The average yield to maturity was unchanged from late Thursday, at 6.36 percent.

HEADLINE: Japan Plans to Spend $86 Billion To Stimulate Its Lagging Economy

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Saying the economy here is in severe straits, Japan's Government tonight announced the largest economic rescue package in the nation's history to try to stimulate growth and strengthen a banking system that has been jeopardized by falling land and stock prices.
The centerpiece of the plan, aimed at jolting the economy, consists of a one-time increase in Government spending of 10.7 trillion yen, or about $86 billion. That money would be used to more than double public works spending for the current fiscal year, which ends next March 31, and to provide new incentives to encourage business investment.
 
U.S. Seeks a Bigger Market

 A second part consists of measures to stabilize banks and other financial institutions by making it easier for them to dispose of bad loans and by propping up land and stock prices. 
 The announcement is giving an immediate psychological lift to business confidence and the stock market. The Nikkei index, after soaring more than 1,000 points on Thursday in anticipation of the plan, rose 415 more points today to close at 17,970.
The United States has been pushing Japan to adopt measures to stimulate growth, in part because it believes a growing Japanese economy will provide a larger market for American exports. Because Japan imports so few products, its politically nettlesome trade surplus with the rest of the world is expected to reach a record of at least $120 billion this year.
The value of the measures is more than 50 percent higher than the amount contemplated two months ago and appears to have been increased by more than 1 trillion yen, or $8 billion, just in the last day.
The rapid increase reflects the growing concern of policy makers here as Japan's mighty electronics and automobile manufacturers begin to report losses, the country's weakened banks become reluctant to make loans for corporate investment and the unemployment rate of 2.2 percent, though relatively low compared with other countries, threatens to begin climbing.
"The Ministry of Finance and other Government agencies have finally accepted the view that the Japanese economy is very weak," said Yoshihisa Kitai, senior economist with the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
Government officials estimated that the measures, representing 2.3 percent of last year's gross national product, would increase economic growth by 2.4 percentage points in the next 12 months. In other words, if the G.N.P. would have grown 2 percent in that period, it should now grow 4.4 percent.
Other economists said that such a large package would indeed spur growth, but that the effect would be gradual. Japan's Parliament is not expected to meet until October to approve a supplementary budget to cover the increased public spending. After that, it will take several months for the money to actually be spent.
"Its real effect is only going to be on 1993," said Kenneth S. Courtis, strategist for Deutsche Bank in Asia, adding that Japan will not achieve its growth target of 3.5 percent for this fiscal year. Nevertheless, he said: "We've never seen a supplemental budget as big as this before. These are very big numbers."
Some business leaders said they were disappointed that the measures did not include tax cuts for individuals. Despite assertions by Japan that it wants to encourage consumer spending, the economic system here is heavily oriented toward helping manufacturers.
 
Purchase of Foreign Goods
 Japanese officials said they could not yet estimate how much imports would increase over all because of the economic package. But they said the Government itself would buy $250 million of foreign goods, mostly scientific and medical equipment, in connection with the extra public works spending this year. In addition to relying on general economic growth to spur imports, the plan announced today includes some special incentives, like low-interest loans for companies that want to sell foreign products in Japan.
The heart of the plan calls for increased public spending of 8.6 trillion yen, or $69 billion. Most of that will be used by both national and local governments to build roads, sewers, schools and other public works.
The remainder will be used to help the sluggish real estate market. That includes an additional 800 billion yen, or $6.4 billion, for housing assistance and 1.55 trillion yen, or $12.4 billion, to buy land for use in future public projects.
In addition to increased public spending, there will be loans and tax incentives valued at 2.1 trillion yen, or $17 billion, to help small businesses and to encourage companies to invest in energy-saving equipment and automation.
Government officials said Japan would probably be able to handle the increased spending without running a budget deficit or spurring inflation.
A second set of measures is aimed at shoring up the financial system and the stock market. Some of these were announced earlier this month, while some are new.
The economic downturn has hobbled banks with huge amounts of bad loans. And the fall in stock prices by almost 60 percent from the peak at the end of 1989 has made it difficult for banks to meet international requirements for their capital levels.
The Government said today that it would provide tax breaks to help banks write off bad loans. It also said that by the end of the year it would come up with concrete proposals to relieve banks of some of the land they have seized when borrowers failed to meet loan payments.
Analysts have likened this idea to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the United States, which was set up to help resolve the savings and loan crisis. But Japanese officials say that unlike in the United States, they do not want to use taxpayer money in this effort.
As for the stock market, the Government said it would make changes that would allow more money in public pension funds and savings programs to be invested in stocks. It will also postpone plans to sell stock in former Government monopolies including Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Japan Tobacco. And it will reduce the minimum number of shares that must be bought or sold at one time to make it easier for individuals to buy stocks.
This 10.7 trillion yen rescue effort, equal to 2.3 percent of the G.N.P., is the biggest ever in Japan not only in absolute amount but also relative to the size of the economy. The last big pump-priming effort, announced in May 1987, amounted to 6 trillion yen and 1.8 percent of G.N.P.
To be sure, what seems like a weak economy here might be envied elsewhere. The gross national product is expected to grow by 2 percent or so this year while in other recession-bound nations it shrinks. And, officially at least, there is still a labor shortage, although it is about to evaporate.
According to figures released by the Labor Ministry today, there were 104 jobs being offered for each 100 people seeking jobs. But that figure has dropped from 147 jobs for each 100 job seekers in March 1991. Moreover, many large corporations have announced that they will trim their work forces by thousands of people over the next few years and reduce hiring of new college graduates. That could lead to a rise in the unemployment rate.

HEADLINE: Some Recall the Apple Sellers and Hoovervilles

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Shipley's attempt to resurrect the reputation of Herbert Hoover (Editorial Notebook, Aug. 10) is a valiant effort. Unfortunately, I remember Hoover. Granted, he was a successful mining engineer. We also heard a great deal about his success in the World War I relief effort, especially during his campaign. 
 It is noteworthy that he wrote his own speeches -- unless you had to listen to them. If there were good ideas buried in that deluge of verbiage, they were obscured by his dreary monotone. When he took office, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. When he left it was 23.6. If "he did his best to end the Depression," he was a dismal failure. Like most Republican Presidents, he appointed many commissions to study these problems, while the economy and the average citizen suffered. The reports were generally shelved, and little was tried.
This is not dull history to me. I was there. I saw the apple sellers on the street corners. I saw the empty, pleading eyes of unemployed men wearing sandwich boards asking for a job -- any job. And there were the shacks made of old cartons for the homeless on many empty city lots. These were dubbed Hoovervilles.
Hoover probably did save the banking business with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, but note that it was created in the final year of his term. It took the bank holiday imposed by Franklin D. Roosevelt as soon as he took office to prevent serious runs on the banks. And it was the quick action of the Roosevelt Administration in presenting a series of "must pass" emergency bills to Congress that prevented further debacle.
I do not wish to demean Hoover's character. He was sincere, honorable, but believed only business could grow us out of crisis. That seems like the "trickle down" theory, which could more properly be called the "trickle on" theory.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Indeed for Forecasters

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For the third time in three years, the nation's most prominent economic forecasters have reversed themselves, and they now say the recovery they had expected by late summer will not happen until this winter -- if then.
With new blows to the American economy announced almost daily, some economists even acknowledge that their forecasting techniques might not be adequate to foresee accurately when the stagnation that has afflicted the United States for more than three years will come to an end. 
 That view shows up in public comments by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. It is reflected in the August survey of 50 forecasters polled monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators. And it showed up in interviews this week with economists who had predicted earlier this year that the economy by now would clearly be on its way to recovery.
 
'Structural Change' Cited

 
 "I am far more wary today than I was a few months ago of predicting how an economy in the midst of structural change is going to perform," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. He had said in the spring that by now a recovery would be under way.
The prolonged stagnation is an issue in the Presidential election campaign, of course. But in all their economic proposals neither President Bush nor Gov. Bill Clinton has embraced either of the two principal solutions offered by economists. One is to let the stagnation run its course; once consumers and corporations work off their huge debts, they will borrow and spend again, and that process cannot be artificially rushed.
The other argues for an artificial stimulant: Government should spend billions on public-works projects, driving up the deficit in the process, but putting people to work with new wages to spend. Companies, in turn, would invest and expand to satisfy the growing demand.
The problem with the first solution is that the wait could be long. The business cycle is not functioning as it has since World War II -- lifting the economy, then easing it into recession and then lifting it again in a familiar pattern of alternating, and more or less predictable, waves and troughs. Since mid-1989, the gross domestic product, measuring the nation's new wealth, has risen each quarter at an annual rate of less than 2 percent.
 
Postponing the Rebound
 Not since World War II has the economy been so weak for so long. The forecasts of recovery have mostly said that in six to nine months the economy would be growing at a job-creating annual rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. But with each disappointment, the recovery date has been pushed back at least six months.
The forecasters in the Blue Chip survey, for example, had predicted in January that the G.D.P. would be growing by 2.5 percent in the second quarter -- not the 1.4 percent growth actually reported. They had also said growth would break 3 percent in the current quarter, but in the August survey, they pushed back this achievement until early next year.
"There is a tendency among forecasters to be too optimistic," said Robert J. Eggert, publisher of the Blue Chip surveys. "If you look at the long-range trend, it is upward: growth with periods of recession. So there is a tendency to look at this trend and to project more growth, and we fail to recognize the forces that will cause the economy to dip below the trend."
The weak growth, in turn, has made the recession that began in July 1990 and apparently ended in the spring of 1991 -- a period in which the G.D.P. shrank -- hard to distinguish from the periods of meager growth. Most economists say the G.D.P. must grow at an annual rate of more than 2 percent to make incomes rise and to shrink unemployment, which rose to 7.7 percent in July from 5.2 percent in April 1989.
 
2 Pieces of Bad News
 Two recent events upset the forecasters. The first was the announcement that the unemployment rate had jumped in June to 7.8 percent from 7.5 percent in May, just when many forecasters thought the economy was on the verge of revival. The second was the announcement that economic growth in the March-through-June quarter fell to an annual rate of 1.4 percent from 2.7 percent in the first quarter.
In hindsight, Federal Reserve officials, including Mr. Greenspan, have concluded that the actual growth rate this year has been just under 2 percent, a level of weakness that for many Americans has become indistinguishable from recession.
"There is a loss of confidence that we understand why the stagnation is continuing, and that has led to a loss of confidence that it will end shortly," said Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board.
The great hope for months had been that sharply falling interest rates would prompt consumers and companies to resume borrowing and spending, not only for store purchases but also for new machinery, appliances and housing. But that stimulant to the economy has not occurred.
Until recently, economists in the Clinton camp had thought that while the economy would not revive on its own before Election Day in November, damaging Mr. Bush's re-election efforts, it would turn up by early next year, giving a Clinton Administration easier sailing. Now the growing possibility of economic stagnation in the opening months of a Clinton Administration "is a definite point of discussion," said Gene Sperling, economic policy director for Mr. Clinton.
While Mr. Bush advocates tax cuts to stimulate the economy, Mr. Clinton calls for more spending on public works. But both candidates stop short of advocating a higher budget deficit to pay for their proposals, bowing to arguments that rising deficits would be inflationary and wasteful.
 
Taxing and Spending
 Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposals -- including a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers -- would be offset by cutbacks in Government spending, while Mr. Clinton would balance public-works spending with tax increases on the wealthy and other measures, one being the diversion of military spending to public works.
"Mr. Clinton would not advocate a solution where he could be seen as using an anti-recession solution as an excuse for not worrying about the deficit," Mr. Sperling said.
Mr. Greenspan says the protracted stagnation is primarily a result of the debts piled up by households and companies in the 1980's, and many economists share this view.
Both sectors are slowly paying off debt, and Mr. Greenspan says he does not know when they will feel ready to borrow and spend again. "The degree of debt retrenchment has turned out to be much greater than experience since World War II would have suggested," he told the Senate Banking Committee last month.
Mr. Greenspan argues that once consumers and corporations regain confidence, healthy economic growth will resume on a surer footing than in the 1980's, particularly since Corporate America is steadily improving its efficiency, largely by laying off thousands of workers and increasing the output of those who remain.
He wants to wait out the process. But Robert M. Solow and James Tobin, both Nobel laureates in economics, argue that the economy should not be allowed to stagnate until the debt problem works itself out. "Economic policy is not a spectator sport," Mr. Solow said. He and Mr. Tobin are the leaders of a group of more than 100 economists calling for an increase in job-creating public spending, financed through a temporary rise in the deficit.
Aside from the debt problem, many economists say some blame for the protracted hard times can be assigned to the economic slowdowns in Europe and Japan, which are big customers for American products; to the cutback in military spending, and to numerous other factors, among them the sharp decline in the formation of small companies, a prime source of jobs in the 1980's.

Where Tax Bills Rival the Mortgages

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLAREMONT, N.H.

 BODY:
Owen and Camilla Wadleigh were proud owners of a gabled stone house that had been in Mr. Wadleigh's family since the mid-1800's, a house where Mr. Wadleigh's father grew up, as did his grandfather before him.
But in a matter of weeks, the Wadleighs will lose their much-beloved home at 43 High Street. Squeezed by rising local property taxes, the Wadleighs, who borrowed from a local bank to buy the house from the estate of Mr. Wadleigh's grandmother, aredeeding the house to the bank to avoid the additional costs of foreclosure proceedings. 
 "In six years' time, our taxes nearly doubled," to $2,000 a year from just over $1,000, said Mrs. Wadleigh, whose job as a legal secretary is the family's main source of income. "It's real difficult when you can't even afford to stay in your home, but when your taxes are as high as your mortgage, you have to wonder. There's just no way."
The Wadleighs' dilemma is unfolding with distressing frequency in this placid town of 15,000 people, where "for sale" signs on front lawns increasingly compete with "garage sale" signs. In a state that has neither a state income tax nor a state sales tax, Claremont's town leaders have leaned heavily on homeowners like the Wadleighs to pay bills, for everything from education, police and fire protection to parks and libraries.
The result is a local property tax rate in Claremont of $33.39 for every $1,000 in assessed value, the second-highest rate in the state after the $34.16 levied by Greenville. Although Alaska similarly has no state sales or income tax, it has oil wealth. All other states provide cities with some financial assistance that helps pay a municipality's bills so local property taxes are not prohibitively high.
Not so in New Hampshire, and in places like Claremont the consequences have been mounting. This year the city estimates it will assume ownership of 16 properties in lieu of taxes, more of them single-family homes than four years ago, when the city took over just eight properties.
"We certainly are not in the business of owning property," said Normand G. Bernaiche, the city assessor, but "the reliance on property taxes puts a heavy burden on the community."
Residents and business owners worry about the high tax rate and its effect on their town. "A lot of people are meeting their limit and have to sell their homes," said Clara Homiak, the owner of Harry's Shoe Barn in downtown Claremont.
Down the street at the Tremont House of Pizza, the co-owner, Neil Petersen, said property taxes on his house have jumped to $3,100 a year from $1,600 two years ago. "Taxes are too high," he said. "There should be a state sales tax."
The Wadleighs can only shake their heads at the tax climate in their state and their own situation.
"It's not easy for anyone to lose their home and certainly under these circumstances because it is a family home and it has a lot more sentimental value," said Mrs. Wadleigh, who is 28 years old and has a 5 1/2-year-old son, Kyle.
The couple moved into the two-story house on a large corner lot six years ago. As taxes increased, at a clip of $150 to $200 a year, the Wadleighs imposed a savings program on themselves to pay the twice-a-year tax bill.
At one point, Mrs. Wadleigh says, they were socking away $200 a month for taxes alone, a sum she says strained the family budget.
There were other circumstances that undermined the family's home ownership. Mr. Wadleigh, 31 years old, lost his job in January 1991 and for eight months could not find work; the stress, his wife said, led to a heart attack in November of that year.
Mr. Wadleigh is in better health now and is working as a manager at a Claremont restaurant. But the stretch of unemployment did not help the family's finances. And when the Wadleighs finally conceded the battle to high taxes a year ago, by putting their home on the market at $69,000, they were hurt again. Like much other real estate, it didn't sell.
The Wadleighs now live in a rented apartment in a nearby town, Lempster, that is cheaper, Mrs. Wadleigh said. But she lamented, "If it wasn't for my job, we would have left New Hampshire a long time ago."

HEADLINE: Income Rise Is Outpaced By Spending

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Faced with slight income growth, Americans dipped into their savings in July to maintain their standard of living, a Commerce Department report showed today.
The department said spending increased by three-tenths of 1 percent, to $4.08 trillion, last month, while incomes rose by just two-tenths of 1 percent, to $5.05 trillion. The pattern was similar in June, when a four-tenths of 1 percent spending rise also outpaced a minimal income gain of one-tenth of 1 percent. 
 Economists warned that as consumers reached into savings to keep up their spending habits, they were reducing the pool of capital available for investment.
"A lot of people are being forced to use their credit cards to borrow money, and so savings are falling." said Marco Babic, an economist with Evans Economics Inc. in Washington.
Savings fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $226.7 billion in July from $228.8 billion in June and $240.7 billion in May. That means that only 5.1 cents out of each dollar earned after taxes was put in savings last month, compared with 5.2 cents in June and 5.5 cents in May.
The savings figure is closely watched by economists not only as a barometer of consumers' economic welfare but also as a measure of capital available for productive investment.
Other than in January, when incomes were flat, incomes have risen by only fractional amounts each month this year. Gains in personal income -- wages and salaries as well as income from dividends and interest -- are essential for consumer purchases, which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity.
"The economic recovery will remain subpar as long as the consumer recovery remains subpar," said Ed Yardeni, an economist with C. J. Lawrence Securities Inc. in New York.
Private-sector wages and salaries were up by $4.5 billion in July from June, the department said, but goods-producing industries' payrolls dropped by $1.5 billion after decreasing $3.2 billion in June.
Separately, the department said the nation's trade deficit during the second quarter increased to an 18-month high of $24.4 billion in the second quarter from $17.2 billion in the first three months of 1992.

HEADLINE: A Twisting Walk to Inner Peace on a Painted Purple Canvas

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Stretched across the nave floor of the majestic Grace Cathedral like a tarpaulin hauled in from a football field, the 35-foot-wide labyrinth is nothing more than a bright purple pattern painted on an expanse of bleached canvas.
Yet the design has an extraordinary pedigree: it is a replica of a labyrinth built into the stone floor of Chartres Cathedral in France, and it inspires in the people who have come to walk along its sinuous, painted path a palpable mix of solemnity and joy. 
 A woman wearing glasses, a peasant skirt and a small, secret smile walked through the maze design one recent evening practically on tiptoe, her gaze turned toward the cathedral's gothic vaulting, her arms lifted away from her sides as if she were about to fly.
Two 9-year-old girls holding hands scurried along with swift, mincing steps, goading each other on and scooting impatiently around any adults in their way; and when they finished following the tightly coiled design, an intricate series of loops and switchbacks that measures a third of a mile long, the pair started it all over again.
 
Finding a Sense of Calm
 They were among more than 100 people gathered at Grace Cathedral on Nob Hill, perhaps the most photographed cathedral in the city, to take part in a ceremony that is at once ancient and New Age mysticism, called "walking the labyrinth."
Two evenings a month, the seven pieces of the makeshift labyrinth are pulled out of duffle bags, stuck together with Velcro and laid out for ritualized walking by anyone who cares to experience the maze, to stroll along its surprising torques and curves and, in so doing, to find a sense of calm.
The labyrinth design painted on the canvas, the only one to be seen in any American church, also evokes a grand sense of history. Back in the 13th and 14th centuries, visitors to Chartres and other soaring cathedrals like Rheim and Amiens would walk the labyrinth designs built into the naves as the spiritual culmination of their lengthy pilgrimages.
The tradition of meditative walking has long since lapsed among Westerners, and chairs now cover the labyrinths of the great French cathedrals so completely that even many devoted Chartres lovers are not even aware the stone maze exists.
But at Grace, the Rev. Lauren Artress, canon pastor of the Episcopal cathedral, is trying to revive the tradition as a tool for encouraging introspection and spiritual transformation, whatever one's religion.
"When I'm walking the labyrinth, I have the chance to think about all the people in my life who are very sick right now," said Joanna DeVito Larson, an unemployed employee counselor. "A friend has ovarian cancer, my brother is addicted to drugs, my sister is falling apart psychologically. It makes me very sad, but being here at Grace gives me the focus that helps me deal with my troubles."
The labyrinth, Ms. Artress said, is a profound archetype seen in most cultures throughout history. The ancient Greeks had the labyrinth of Minos, whose serpentine corridors on the island of Crete led to the Minotaur, a creature with the head of a bull, the body of a man, and a bottomless appetite for sacrificial young men and maidens. Hindus and Buddhists have the mandala, a circular design symbolizing the universe and totality. For medieval Christians, the labyrinth became a manageable substitute for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
 
Act of Celebration
 All good Christians vowed to visit Jerusalem during their lives, but most had to settle for a pilgrimage to great cathedrals like Chartres. Walking the labyrinth served as the final stage of the pilgrim's journey.
In the new rendition of the labyrinth rite, walking is less an act of penance than of celebration. Walkers are gently tutored on how to get the most out of the maze.
Going into the center, a walker is supposed to shed the solipsistic obsessions of everyday life. At the center of the labyrinth, a six-petal design, the pilgrim looks for illumination. "I call it clarity," Ms. Artress said. "You get insight into yourself."
On the way out from the center, the walker should feel a sense of communion with the cosmos, God, or some sort of higher, healing power. One woman at Grace, a retired lawyer who now writes for a living, described the experience of walking the labyrinth as "a dance I do with my soul."
 
Revealing Exercise
 A high school math teacher said he found the journey toward the center much harder than the journey back out. "I practically stumbled while I was going in," he said. "Going out was much more peaceful."
But even for the spiritually tone-deaf, walking the labyrinth is a revealing exercise. The turns never take the walker where the thinking brain had expected; the center of the maze remains elusive for an astonishing length of time, and one gains new appreciation for how an enormous amount of material can be compressed into a small space simply through artful winding.
Over the next few months, a permanent stone labyrinth will be built in the cathedral garden, and Ms. Artress will be taking the canvas labyrinth on the road, to show churches and other groups in Southern California, New York, North Carolina and elsewhere how to design one.
"You have to get the mystical figure in the center right," she said. Underneath the center is a 13-pointed star. "When you lay that star right," she said, "then all the paths are perfectly balanced."

HEADLINE: A Heaping Plate of Ventures for Chili's Impresario

 BODY:
On any given day or night, Norman Brinker, a tall, balding man who comes off as a slightly befuddled tourist, can be found wandering the parking lots of America's restaurants. "How was the food?" he asks patrons as they leave.
So far, at least, there has been nothing befuddled about Norman Brinker. The parking lots are probably his, or a competitor's, and what he is doing is his version of market reseach. 
 On Wall Street, Mr. Brinker, who heads the Chili's Grill and Bar restaurant chain, is regarded as a visionary on the order of Ray Kroc, the man who built McDonald's. Mr. Brinker has built Chili's, based in Dallas, into one of the fasting-growing restaurant chains in America. He expanded it from 23 stores in 1984 to 276 now, increasing revenues to almost $600 million, from $40 million. Over the last five years, both revenues and earnings of Brinker International, the publicly owned company of which he is now chairman and chief executive, have been growing at a rate of nearly 30 percent compounded annually. Chili's has $40 million in cash on hand -- and no debt.
 
 
5 Chains at Once
 Now Mr. Brinker is beginning a new venture that some say is both rare and risky: he is trying to run as many as five restaurant chains at once.
In so doing, Mr. Brinker, who is 61 years old, is leading a direct assault on his chief competitors, General Mills Inc., which owns Red Lobster and Olive Garden, the two largest full-service restaurant chains; the McDonald's Corporation, and Pepsico Inc., the country's largest restaurateur, which owns Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
In the last year, Mr. Brinker has added 31 new Chili's across the country. The restaurants serve a full range of moderately priced foods. He has recently acquired two other Southern chains and plans to expand them nationally: Romano's Macaroni Grill, an Italian-food chain that now has 13 units, and Grady's, which serves traditional American dishes, with 17 units. Beyond that, he has begun work on a new Italian chain called Spageddies, which recently opened its first unit, and a Mexican-food chain. His goal is to double sales by 1995.
"It is very rare for a company to successfully manage more than one restaurant chain" and do it well, said Steven A. Rockwell, restaurant analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore. But, he added, "if there is an individual who can do it -- set up the systems and attract the people -- it's Brinker."
That seems to be the consensus. "Norman truly is a great entrepreneur and a great innovator," said Joe R. Lee, chief financial officer of General Mills. "And he takes care of his investors really well." Scott Allmendinger, editor of Restaurant Business, a trade publication, said, "At every company he's been with, he's had the Midas touch."
 
 
Founded Bennigan's
 Before Chili's, Mr. Brinker ran the Pillsbury Company's restaurant group, which then owned Burger King and was the nation's second-largest restaurateur, behind McDonald's. At Pillsbury, he also founded Bennigan's.
In the last year, Chili's has moved into third place, behind Red Lobster and Olive Garden, in the category known as casual dining. In the meantime, Bennigan's has slipped to fifth place, from third, behind T.G.I. Friday's.
Casual dining, a field in which Mr. Brinker was a pioneer, refers to a sort of middle range between fast food and fine dining: full-menu table service in a restaurant environment, but at prices that may be only a few dollars more than a dinner at McDonald's. Dress is weekend casual, though waiters may be in black tie.
The time does seem right for expansion in casual dining, which is quickly replacing fast food as the industry growth leader. Even with the recession, customer traffic in the casual segment rose 8.4 percent in the 1989 fiscal year, 4.6 percent in the 1990 fiscal year and 1.5 percent in the 1991 fiscal year, while fast food rose only 1.2 percent, 2.4 percent and 1.8 percent in the same periods. Casual dining revenues rose 15 percent in 1991, compared with about 5 percent for fast food.
Fast food, for all of its growth, was aimed almost exclusively at young consumers at a time -- the 1960's -- when 15 percent of all Americans were between 13 and 20 years old. It took a number of years for fast food to grow beyond those demographics.
Casual dining, by contrast, is taking business away from all segments, from fast food, coffee shops and, especially, fine restaurants.
Throughout the 1988-91 period, customer traffic at fine-dining establishments fell 7.5 percent, then 7 percent, then another 11.6 percent, according to the National Restaurant Association.
 
Aging Customers
 "With the aging of America," said Mr. Lee of General Mills, "you'll get about 20 million additional people between the ages of 40 to 60 by the year 2000. Those people happen to be the highest frequenters of casual-dining restaurants."
Mr. Lee figures that at least 184 million more meals will be eaten out annually by 2000. The 45-to-54 age bracket will rise 47 percent, with the number of people from 55 to 65 rising 14 percent.
And younger Americans can be expected to switch from fast food as they mature, analysts say. As a rule, people who have come of age since the 1950's tend to eat out more often than earlier generations. And Mr. Brinker is one of those responsible.
"Prior to the 60's," he said, "people were looking at restaurants as places to eat, a place to get food," and that was it.
 F. Lane Cardwell Jr., planning chief of Brinker International, said Mr. Brinker "kind of rewrote that script" at Steak and Ale, which he ran for Pillsbury, "and said what people are looking for is some fun and good food."
 
Eliminating theGeneric Waiter
 It was really with Steak and Ale, he said, that Mr. Brinker introduced Americans to relatively inexpensive dinners in a pleasant but casual setting, a salad bar and waiters who introduced themselves by saying, "Hello, I'm Michael and I'll be your waiter this evening."
Mr. Brinker credits his shoe-leather market research, the endless polling of departing customers -- his and competitors' -- with helping him to keep up with changing consumer tastes.
He said he tried to introduce fixes, tiny and large, to keep the menu and decor at just the right point on what he calls the "life style curve."
"The difference between winning and losing is such a tiny little fraction," Mr. Brinker said. "If you're 'off life style' even a little bit, you won't be successful."
 Two other trends he tried to keep up with were people's concern for their health and their taste, so to speak, for adventure.
"From 1980 to 1985," he said, "the tons of spices sold in the U.S. went up five or six times."
And the increased seasoning of foods allowed restaurants to come up with healthier foods that were still tasty. No matter how healthy a food is, he said, "if it doesn't taste good it won't work."
Despite the hesitancy of others toward his plans for a huge expansion in five or more chains, Mr. Brinker seems confident. He reminds people that he has already done it.
At Pillsbury, he briefly ran four chains -- Steak and Ale, Bennigan's, Burger King and Poppin' Fresh -- and he says earnings tripled by the time he left the company.
The trick, he said, is to operate the chains as separate entities, under separate, stable management, with separate styles and ambiance.
"We've got a good shot at it," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on the Mark But Drops Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished trading mixed yesterday as the yen bounced higher after Japan released details of a large fiscal package to stimulate that nation's economy. Gold prices rose.
Investors were encouraged by the $86.3 billion-plus plan to fix Japan's economy through increased public works and investment, said Paul Stancs, a trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. in New York. 
 "It really gave the yen a boost that it sustained throughout the session," he said.
Heavy selling of German marks for yen helped the dollar against the mark but the mark-yen cross trading also aggravated the American currency's decline against the yen, traders said.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 123.05 Japanese yen, down from 124.75 yen Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar dropped 1.35 yen to close at 123.60 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.20 yen.
In New York, the dollar continued to drift higher after hitting a record low of 1.4015 marks early this week. The dollar edged upward to 1.4090 marks, from 1.4085 late Thursday, in New York trading.
But the dollar reversed course in Europe, slipping to 1.4060 marks in late trading from 1.4110 marks late Thursday. Low interest rates in the United States and a sluggish economy have discouraged investment in the dollar.
The meeting of deputy ministers from the Group of Seven major industrialized nations ended yesterday with no public statements on the dollar.
Ministers discussed the currency's recent weakness and interest rates. Traders were waiting to see if the Group of Seven might intervene on the dollar's behalf.
In New York, the British pound was quoted at $1.9825, up from $1.9800 late Thursday. In London, the pound was quoted at $1.9815, up from $1.9770 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.2610 Swiss francs, up from 1.2605; 4.800 French francs, down from 4.8015; 1,077.50 Italian lire, up from 1,077.00, and 1.19655 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19575.
Gold prices rose around the world.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $339.90 an ounce, up 70 cents from $339.20 on Thursday.
The Republic National Bank said gold rose to a late bid price of $339.75 an ounce, up 80 cents from Thursday.
Gold traded in London late yesterday at $339.95 an ounce, up from $339 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the bid was $340 an ounce, up from $339 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.57 an ounce to close at $340.59.
On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.674 an ounce, down from $3.705 on Thursday. Silver traded in London at a bid of $3.70 an ounce, unchanged from Thursday.

HEADLINE: Strike by Professors Is Settled At the University of Bridgeport

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Aug. 28

 BODY:
A two-year strike by professors at the University of Bridgeport has been settled, the administration and faculty union announced Thursday, with the union likening the settlement to a divorce.
As part of the settlement, both sides agreed not to disclose its terms. But people familiar with the agreement said the 66 professors and librarians who have remained on strike since September 1990 are dropping all claims against the university in return for buyouts of as much as a year's salary. They will not get their jobs back. 
 "We're getting a divorce," said Professor Donna Wagner, the president of Bridgeport's chapter of the American Association of University Professors. "After two years, most of the people on strike are really tired and needing to get on with their lives."
For the administration, the settlement eliminates some of its most scathing critics, as well as their claims on any new faculty positions that the university might create. The university has been restored to financial health by the Professors World Peace Academy, an affiliate of the Unification Church.
The university president, Dr. Edwin G. Eigel Jr., would not comment except for a statement saying, "We are working very hard to do whatever is necessary to bring an end to all our differences."
The strike was one of the bitterest at an American university, and the first in which the administration hired instructors to replace the strikers, effectively breaking the strike.
The cost for the financially struggling university was high, however. While the administration was seeking to eliminate nearly a third of the 158 faculty positions at the time and cut salaries as much as 30 percent, the strike and ensuing publicity drove away more than 1,000 students.
 
Academy Offer Causes Uproar
 Little more than a year later, trustees considered an offer of aid from the Professors World Peace Academy, setting off a new uproar. As the financial crisis deepened, trustees made plans to eliminate the university's liberal-arts programs, sought a merger with another institution and finally set a date for closing entirely.
This summer, however, the university did reach an agreement with the Professors World Peace Academy, which promised to invest as much as $50 million in the next several years in return for choosing a majority of the university's trustees. Classes will resume next week for an estimated 1,300 full-time and part-time students.
"This settlement closes the door on the past for the striking faculty," Dr. Wagner said. "Given the changes taking place at UB, this is necessary. We are relieved to put the dispute behind us."

HEADLINE: Heady Opportunities for Home Buyersw

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
Since the economy started to sputter a few years ago, home prices, which soared during the 1980's, have leveled off or declined nearly everywhere. Buyers have also benefited from steadily falling mortgage-interest rates.
As a result, homes throughout the country are more affordable now than they have been since the mid-1970's. Nationwide, mortgage interest rates have fallen about 2.5 percent since 1989. But even in a favorable market, the task of finding and paying for a house can be a daunting one. And when the price is right, there is often a temptation to overlook flaws or to rush the deal. 
 "My main piece of advice for anyone looking for a home today is to look for long-term value, not just a good price," said John Tucillo, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors in Washington. "A buyer who bases his purchasing decision on price alone might get a tremendous deal in terms of the dollars, but no appreciation potential."
Buyers should ask themselves, he said, how long they expect to live in their homes and should try to anticipate the neighborhood's long-term appeal.
"Buyers should not take on more than they can afford," Mr. Tucillo said. "But today they have the luxury of stretching it a bit, because interest rates are low."
In some areas, bargain hunters have additional opportunities in the discounted prices of homes sold in bank foreclosures, through builder-sponsored auctions or repossessions by public agencies like the Resolution Trust Corporation or the Federal Housing Administration. Depending on location, condition and the degree of desperation of the seller, the discount on distressed properties can range from 20 to 40 percent.
 
Special Sales
 But real estate professionals say that getting the most for your money means, above all, knowing what you are buying. "I tell buyers who are in the market for bargains to seek out vacant properties," said Michael Teer, a broker in Riverside, Calif. "When the home is empty, it is usually a sign that the seller, whether it is a bank or an owner who has moved on, is willing to be flexible."
But at the same time, Mr. Teer cautioned that vacant homes or those bought in special sales often come with problems. "A buyer will need to be particularly diligent when it comes to the inspection process," he said. "Finding a reputable structural engineer is critical."
Emma and Joe Benson bought a three-bedroom home in Riverside earlier this summer from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency set up to dispose of properties owned by failed savings and loan institutions. The $85,000 that the Bensons paid for the house was well below the market price for homes of its size and age. Mr. Benson is a skilled carpenter and can handle most home-repair jobs, so the couple was not put off by the structure's rotting roof, tattered kitchen flooring, cracked cement and soiled carpeting.
The Bensons will surely see a rise in the value of their home when their renovation is finished. But the same purchase could have been a risky investment for a buyer lacking Mr. Bensons' home-repair skills. If the cost of correcting flaws in a fixer-upper pushes the total investment beyond the structure's appraised value, the buy is no bargain.
 
Leasing With Option to Buy
 House hunters should not overlook rental listings. Often, a prospective seller who has not yet been able to make a sale but who is under pressure to move -- in cases of divorce or job relocation, for example -- will accept a short-term lease. "Lease with option to buy" contracts have spread as the market has slowed. The benefit to the tenants is that they get to try out the residence, and often the owner will agree to take part of the rent off the purchase price if there is a sale.
While an atmosphere of declining home prices can be a boon to buyers, lenders have tightened their mortgage-qualification standards in the face of falling values and mounting foreclosures. Still, mortgage money has not dried up. Bankers have rolled out the welcome mat for mortgage applicants with sufficient income, good credit ratings and job stability.
 
Prequalifying for a Mortgage
 Marie H. Roller, a senior vice president of Ridgefield Bank in Ridgefield, Conn., said house hunters could save time and avoid the trauma of seeing their deals fall apart by prequalifying for their mortgages. Ridgefield Bank is among the lenders that will give buyers letters certifying their ability to qualify for loans.
"The prequalification gives the buyers an idea of how much they can afford," Ms. Roller said. "Another advantage is that in a soft market, sellers are often nervous about whether potential buyers can get loans. The prequalifying letter gives the seller some comfort and can make the process move faster."
Gregory T. Barmore, president of the General Electric Capital Mortgage Corporation, a national mortgage lender based in Raleigh, N.C., said a common misconception is that buyers must make down payments of 15 to 20 percent to qualify for mortgages.
With mortgage insurance, usually about six-tenths of a percent of the mortgage amount, buyers can qualify for loans with as little as 5 percent down. Mr. Barmore said that nationwide, one-fourth of his company's mortgage loans are made to home buyers with down payments of 10 percent or less.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Quayle Draws Distinctions on Environment

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Aug. 28

 BODY:
Picking up where President Bush left off in Michigan three days ago, Vice President Dan Quayle portrayed the Democratic Presidential ticket today as "environmental elites" who have lost sight of the need to balance ecological protection with job creation.
 In a speech to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids, Mr. Quayle outlined what he identified as the underpinnings of the debate between Republicans and Democrats on the environment. 
We envision man as the harvester, working with the Earth to raise up homes and cities, respecting nature but shaping it to legitimate ends," Mr. Quayle said. "They view man more as an uninvited guest here on Earth, settling down and consuming resources to which he has no right."
 As he and President Bush have done in the past, Mr. Quayle based his charges on "Earth in the Balance" (Houghton, Mifflin), a best-selling book written by Senator Al Gore, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee. The book prescribes bitter medicine for preserving the environment, and it has provided the Republicans with ammunition for repeated blasts at Mr. Gore and his running mate, Gov. Bill Clinton.
 Mr. Clinton has not embraced many of the measures suggested by Mr. Gore, but that has not kept Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle from associating Mr. Clinton with the book.
 While campaigning in Michigan on Tuesday, Mr. Bush criticized Mr. Clinton's proposal to raise automobile fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon by the turn of the century from its current level of 27.5. He said the plan would cost 40,000 jobs in Michigan.
 Mr. Quayle reiterated that theme today, adding that "the National Academy of Sciences says that this level is not even technically achievable." But Richard A. Meserve, a Washington lawyer and physicist who served as the chairman of the academy's recent study on fuel efficiency, said that Mr. Quayle had misunderstood a report by the academy that had discussed whether cars that efficient would be attractive to American buyers.

CASTRO'S FINAL HOUR
The Secret Story Behind
the Coming Downfall of Communist Cuba.
By Andres Oppenheimer.
Illustrated. 461 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $25. 
 Fidel Castro has survived a host of calamities: the missile crisis, the trade embargo, the Mariel exodus, repeated harvest shortfalls and endless rationing. The C.I.A. and, more recently, the Miami exile community and many academics studying Cuba have predicted Mr. Castro's collapse. He has so far confounded them all.
It is only natural that the implosion of the Soviet bloc invites a new wave of apocalyptic predictions, like that now offered in the breathless title of a new book: "Castro's Final Hour: The Secret Story Behind The Coming Downfall of Communist Cuba." The transparent marketing behind such a title might easily be forgiven, especially since the very first paragraph of the book admits that the "final hour" may extend to weeks or even years. But the expectation of Mr. Castro's end is raised repeatedly. It looms over the entire narrative, though the evidence presented for it (predictable determinations that Cubans do not like living under Communism and that, left adrift without a Soviet lifeline, the orphaned revolution is undergoing great strains) does not lead to a clear conclusion.
Andres Oppenheimer, a veteran Latin American correspondent for The Miami Herald, tells us with insight and wit that corruption is rife, nobody works anymore, teen-agers are growing restless and hope has disappeared along with imports of Soviet oil and East German tractors. Mr. Castro, he says, is "setting the stage for a radical reaction against all he had stood for." But are Cubans ready to rebel? Mr. Oppenheimer suggests at one point that it is only a matter of time, although at another he notes, "The rapid deterioration of Cuba's standard of living following the 1989 changes in Eastern Europe had a paralyzing effect on most Cubans' political activism."
Beaten down by waiting on line most days for everything from soap to chickens, and frightened by an omnipresent security apparatus, Cubans are apparently too enervated to march or pick up a gun. Many of the most dynamic simply flee the island. Moreover, numerous poor people, Mr. Oppenheimer writes, cautiously support the regime because they are afraid the Miami exile elite will return to install a still harsher dictatorship and seize back their former mansions, which now serve as multifamily dwellings. Cubans grumble about fuel rationing, but they have taken to bicycle riding with a passion they once reserved for baseball.
Fortunately, the book's muddled analytical framework only partly distracts from some excellent reporting. Mr. Oppenheimer succeeded in gaining access to official sources as well as dissidents. He offers the definitive account of the 1989 Ochoa-De la Guardia show trial, involving a Government cocaine ring, and puts to rest persistent rumors that Mr. Castro faced an imminent coup; students of Cuban politics will learn that Mr. Castro purged and consolidated his security apparatus at the first sign that members of his inner circle were grumbling, but long before they considered a rebellion. He executed two of his closest aides to deflect an expected Bush Administration blitz of verifiable charges that his regime was trafficking in cocaine to earn hard currency.
"Castro's Final Hour" also sheds new light on several of the Cuban leader's foreign adventures in the days when he was impossibly overextended. Mr. Castro sent experienced officers to train Nicaragua's Sandinista army in counterinsurgency, and planned a joint Nicaraguan-Cuban invasion of Honduras and El Salvador in case the United States under Ronald Reagan invaded Nicaragua. Anticipating that the 1990 Nicaraguan election could end in a Sandinista defeat, Mr. Castro tried but failed to persuade President Daniel Ortega Saavedra to cancel the vote. And in nearby Panama, Mr. Oppenheimer tells us, Mr. Castro was far more involved than we originally knew, shipping 80,000 weapons there and training hundreds of Manuel Antonio Noriega's officers in anticipation of the United States invasion.
With Cuban soldiers in Angola to support the Marxist Government, Mr. Castro made himself an obstacle to a negotiated settlement of that country's civil war in the 1980's, long after the Russians and even his own generals realized an outright military victory was impossible. Havana could not afford to keep an army on the march so far from home, so his officers were forced to engage in the most complex illegal ventures. In one ploy, Mr. Oppenheimer discloses, they exchanged Cuban sugar on the Angolan black market for ivory and diamonds, which they proceeded to sell in Panama in order to feed and clothe their troops.
But the book stumbles again in the concluding chapter, "Requiem for a Revolution," when Mr. Oppenheimer returns to ponder the unconfirmable. He advises Mr. Castro to liberalize the political system before violence breaks out, even after he has concluded that Cuba's modest economic liberalization, undertaken to attract tourism, will quicken the regime's collapse. Evidently Mr. Castro has learned his own lessons from the falling dominoes of Marxist regimes from Moscow to Managua: Those that reform their political systems cannot prevent change from spinning out of their control, while those that restrict liberalization to economics alone, such as the Chinese and Vietnamese, may manage to hold off their final hour.

VOLTAIRE'S BASTARDS
The Dictatorship of Reason in the West.
By John Ralston Saul.
640 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $29.95. 
 "THIS age makes me so sick," George Orwell wrote in 1934, "that sometimes I am almost impelled to stop at a corner and start calling down curses from Heaven." Alienation of this all-embracing kind is a peculiarly contemporary phenomenon. Some of the latter-day alienated focus on the sheer beastliness of the here and now, while others seek to pinpoint the exact historical moment when things first started going downhill: the French Revolution, the American Civil War, the publication of "The Communist Manifesto," the introduction of the assembly line. But all have in common one source of disgust: it is modernity itself they reject.
John Ralston Saul, the author of "Voltaire's Bastards: The Dictatorship of Reason in the West," is a member of the historical-moment wing of antimodernity, and his moment is the Age of Reason. It is the premise of this very long and very angry book that the West has spent the last two centuries in the grip of a cult of reason that has brought it to the brink of ruin: "The philosophers of Europe, England and America threw themselves into the arms of reason, convinced that birth would be given to new rational elites capable of building a new civilization. . . . And yet the exercise of power, without the moderating influence of any ethical structure, rapidly became the religion of these new elites. And their reforms included an unparalleled and permanent institutionalization of state violence."
The Age of Reason, Mr. Saul contends, killed off religion, replacing it with a theology of power whose new priest is the technocrat. Regardless of whether they call themselves socialists or free-marketeers, all technocrats are the same under the skin, sharing as they do "an optimistic assumption that a schematic reorganization of society will be good for the human race." When hubris finally brings them down, they are invariably replaced by romantic "heroes" like Napoleon or Hitler, charismatic leaders who are no less confident of their ability to "deliver the rational state, but to do so in a populist manner." Since men on horseback are no more capable of ushering in the millennium than faceless managers, the West is doomed to lurch from hubristic failure to hubristic failure, presumably forever.
The first 76 pages of "Voltaire's Bastards," in which Mr. Saul lays out his thesis, are readable and occasionally stimulating. After that, things grow tedious, in large part because this relentlessly verbose book is almost completely lacking in narrative sweep. (Mr. Saul would have done well to spend an evening or two with Paul Johnson's "Modern Times" before sitting down to write.) Though he holds a doctorate in history, he writes like an autodidact, anxiously seeking to prove his expertise through the unselective piling up of detail on detail, and far too much of what he clearly intends as trenchant social criticism is flatulent cliche: "On Wall Street, on April 24, 1987, a rock band appeared on the floor of the American Stock Exchange to excite brokers with its music. The Hard Rock Cafe restaurant franchise was going public. The appearance of that band on the trading floor symbolized the service-industry mind, the role of hype in a deregulated marketplace and the idiotic joy which always appears in moments of economic anarchy."
To be sure, Mr. Saul is onto something when he singles out the blind worship of reason as the original sin of the 20th century. Unfortunately, a lot of people have been onto the same thing for a lot longer. Mr. Saul devotes little more than a page of "Voltaire's Bastards" to Edmund Burke, whom he praises as a thinker "closer to the middle way than were the optimistic rationalists, who imagined whole populations sliced free of their limiting past and present, then flipped over to fry in a new, clean future with all the inanimate passivity of a Big Mac." (That passage is a good example of Mr. Saul's taste in metaphor.) No mention is made here or elsewhere of the fact that Burke spawned a whole school of political philosophy, the conservative intellectual movement, whose members, the British political philosopher Michael Oakeshott in particular, have written extensively about the way in which post-Enlightenment rationalism encouraged widespread belief in what Peter Drucker has called "salvation by society" and paved the way for modern totalitarianism.
IT is true that Mr. Saul's critique of modernity is far more sweeping (and indiscriminate) than that of many conservatives, but he nonetheless seems ignorant of the fact that much of what he says has been said before, and said better. I say "ignorant" because Mr. Saul gives no sign of being aware that there is a conservative intellectual movement, much less that it is not identical with, say, any existing political party. To him there is only "the Right," which is almost as bad as "the Left": "The Right and the Left, like Fascism and Communism . . . are the naive answers that one would expect from a central ideology which, in its very heart, believes in absolute solutions." Mr. Saul is a Canadian who has spent much of his adult life in Europe, and his knowledge of American conservatism may well be sketchy. But whatever the reason, his failure to acknowledge the existence of earlier, more specific versions of his attack on modernity severely diminishes the impact of this book.
Some of Mr. Saul's other oddities of tone are doubtless explained by the fact that he is a writer of thrillers by profession. His first and most successful novel, "The Birds of Prey," is one of those portentous little tales about how a brilliant but cynical young writer suffering from soul-deadening ennui inadvertently stumbles across an international conspiracy, rediscovering the meaning of life and having a lot of great sex before dying at the hands of "the forces of order." The writers of such books usually have an obsessive streak, and Mr. Saul is no exception, judging by his near-compulsive interest in the alleged sins of St. Ignatius Loyola, Cardinal Richelieu, Robert McNamara and Henry Kissinger, each of whom seems to pop up like a cardboard target every 50 pages or so in "Voltaire's Bastards."
In the end, though, the most irritating thing about this book is that it leaves the impression that nothing much can be done to ameliorate the endless horrors of the modern world. The trouble with this sort of luxuriant, alienation-driven pessimism is that a little of it goes a long way. After 600 pages of humorless carping, one finally wants to ask the author, "And just what do you propose to do about the dictatorship of reason, Mr. Smartypants?" Here is his answer; it appears on the next-to-last page: "The secret, then, is that we must alter our civilization from one of answers to one which feels satisfaction, not anxiety, when doubt is established." (Stop the presses!) Perhaps that is an unfair question to ask a philosopher, but it is perfectly fair to ask it of a pseudo-philosopher, and when one finally lays down this book, it is with the perverse but irresistible desire to summon Marx to remind John Ralston Saul of the single most influential piece of advice uttered in modern times: "Philosophers have only interpreted the world; the point is to change it."

HEADLINE: DESIGN;
Curtain Calls

BYLINE: By Jody Shields

 BODY:
It seems only fair that decorative rebellion is about to get its due. For decades, artists have used unexpected materials to create interiors. But today, roused by a recycling, recession-driven, please-downscale-it's-the-90's attitude, interior designers have found materials like paper, plastic and aluminum foil more acceptable.
John Drews, interior designer and vice president of the New York decorating group McMillen Inc., and Mary Bright, an artist who is also a curtain designer, designed the window treatments made of paper and plastic that appear on these pages. "As long as the material covers the windows, it does the job," says Bright, who has also designed drapes in leather, burlap and twine. Drews has more of an establishment perspective. McMillen is 68 years old and counts the likes of the socialite Anne Cox Chambers among its swagged and valenced clients. The switch from thread and silk to a staple gun and paper "opened up a new bag of tricks" for Drews. 
 To appreciate the use of ephemeral materials in decor, it helps to forget about their normal, everyday uses. Plastic, one of the most practical, versatile and sturdy materials available, creates a translucent, almost weightless effect when used for curtains. Paper is sweetly fragile and flexible. The goofy glitter of foil can cover walls and furniture like a three-dimensional coat of paint. In a Santa Monica, Calif., house designed by the architect Michael McDonough, Izhar Patkin, an artist, wrapped a lamp in foil, defusing the seriousness of the rest of the decor.
Predecessors of this esthetic include Florine Stettheimer, a painter and colleague of Marcel Duchamp. In the early 1930's, she constructed cellophane drapes in the living room of her Manhattan apartment. Cellophane was also what she chose for the sets of the 1934 Virgil Thomson opera "Four Saints in Three Acts." She crumpled and draped it into a startling set that looked like spun sugar.
Cecil Beaton was another artist with a theatrical flair. In the 1920's, Beaton photographed celebrities against foil, plastic and tinsel backdrops. It "created an extraordinary atmospheric effect of shimmer, like sunlight on water," Beaton said. (Apparently bitten by this historical reference, Karl Lagerfeld revived foil backdrops for a recent ad campaign.)
In keeping with the low-key mood of the 90's, Deborah Turbeville used wrapping paper as the backdrop for a recent exhibition of her photographs. Andy Warhol -- but maybe not the fire marshal -- would have applauded her installation.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Deborah Turbeville used wrapping paper as a backdrop for a recent photography show. Cecil Beaton photographed the actress Norma Shearer in front of a crinkled plastic backdrop. Andy Warhol had the walls of his Factory covered with patches of aluminum foil in the early 60's. Lavish, floor-to-ceiling cellophane drapes were the artist Florine Stettheimer's signature. (pg. 65); The Drama of Avant-Garde Drapes -- The Cartier mansion in New York, designed by Ogden Codman Jr. in 1915, is the backdrop for Mary Bright's curtains, made of dry-cleaner's bags, slipcover plastic and pleating paper. They were held in place by a strip from a Levolor blind. (pg. 66); Curtains in a Classical Mode -- Following a classical drapery pattern, John Drews used simple materials and tools to construct his elegant curtains: sheets of Japanese rice paper, masking tape and a staple gun. The pleats were all pinched in by hand. (pg. 67)(Photographs by Todd Eberle for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: International Gumshoe

BYLINE: By L. J. Davis; L. J. Davis, a contributing editor of Harper's, writes often on financial subjects.

 BODY:
"It will probably be the most interesting thing we have ever done," says Jules Kroll.
The world's most famous gumshoe is matter-of-fact about his company's latest major international assignment: the Republic of Russia has hired it to locate the money -- an estimated $6 billion to $8 billion in 1991 alone -- believed to have been spirited out of the country by the directors of state enterprises when they realized that privatization was inevitable. The Russian Government wants Kroll to get the money back. 
 Wearing his trademark suspenders and holding, as usual, a cigar the size of a small fire extinguisher, the 51-year-old Kroll looks like a successful executive, which, of course, he is. The conference room in which he sits is unabashedly corporate, with its black marble-topped table, gray walls, discreet telecommunications center and forgettable artwork. The only signs of individuality, in these nonsmoking times, are the huge crystal ashtray and black cigarette lighter. Kroll's spacious corner office in mid-Manhattan is equally corporate and anonymous, with the exception of the Dick Tracy handcuffs on the console by the window.
It was during the anything-goes 1980's that Kroll came to be known as Wall Street's private eye. Kroll's operatives were able to trace the large and sometimes clandestine movements of money through so-called bank havens like Luxembourg, the Bahamas and Grand Cayman Island, which had stringent secrecy laws. As hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts proliferated on Wall Street, Kroll's people became adept at analyzing the creditworthiness of a possible buyer and the true financial value of a proposed acquisition. They were also able to detect illicit trading by investors who had obtained confidential information. In short, as the financial game grew wilder, and a bewildering array of junk bonds, bridge loans, payment-in-kind bonds and other money-raising tactics were invented, Kroll's job was to inform his clients if the game was worth the candle. It is an expertise that has been increasingly sought after by foreign governments.
Fifteen Kroll operatives are on the Russian case. Joseph R. Rosetti, the vice chairman and former chief of security for I.B.M., is in Moscow. So is E. Norbert Garrett, a managing director and former C.I.A. station chief in Cairo and Kuwait. The task appears to be a daunting one. Russia is a country with primitive computer systems and complex, frequently falsified, paper work that has a way of disappearing.
Although the investigation has begun in Moscow, Kroll says the most important clues are locked in the records of Russia's foreign trading partners. Money, when stolen in large quantities by white-collar criminals, always leaves a trail, because the thieves have to disguise their thefts as legitimate transactions and because they have to know where the money is hidden.
"We're going to be visiting and seeking records from Russia's major suppliers," Kroll says cautiously, "particularly in the food area and in oil-field equipment. And we'll also be looking at major foreign importers, again mostly of commodities. Outside Russia, commodities trading is highly computerized; records exist." He permits himself a thin, detective's smile. "We will, of course, be visiting these people and seeking their cooperation." (If he fails to obtain it, the Russian Government can, of course, subpoena those corporate records.)
For some time now, there have been rumors that a great deal of the former Soviet Union's gold is also missing. But on the subject of gold, Kroll will say only, "There are some things I can talk about and some things I can't." He does reveal he is being paid in scarce hard currency, which may be the nearly broke republic's most profound tribute to his skills. Kroll's services do not come cheaply. The firm will not release figures, but some observers say its minimum fee is $1,500 per agent per day.
Like Pinkerton in its 19th-century heyday and the fictional Sherlock Holmes, Kroll Associates has become a troubled government's natural choice when an investigator is required to undertake a task beyond the abilities of its own police and intelligence services. Kroll was hired by the Government of Haiti to locate the hundreds of millions of dollars appropriated by Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier, the former President for Life, and its investigations led to the seizure of bank accounts in New York, London, Luxembourg, Paris and Geneva. It did pro bono work for the House Foreign Affairs Committee in ferreting out part of the assets Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos concealed from the Philippine Government. Closer to home, Kroll Associates has been involved in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's investigation of the $500 billion savings and loan scandal, but Jules Kroll declines to discuss his company's involvement.
For more than a year, Kroll Associates has been engaged, on behalf of the Government of Kuwait, in a search for the immense private fortune of the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. In a much-publicized appearance on "60 Minutes," Kroll estimated Saddam Hussein's hoard, most of it stashed in Europe, at around $10 billion, a figure that others have since revised upward to at least $50 billion.
Last summer, Kroll Associates was in the news again. With a committee of the Peruvian Congress as its client, it investigated allegations that Alan Garcia, Peru's past President, might have stolen millions during his term of office, in part using a branch of the now-notorious Bank of Credit and Commerce International (B.C.C.I.) as his conduit. More recently, Kroll was engaged by the investigative body of the Brazilian Congress to determine whether Paulo Cesar Farias, President Fernando Collor de Mello's former campaign manager, might have spirited millions of dollars out of the country.
When Kroll is not actively investigating an international cast of scoundrels, he has occasionally been hired by them. Two weeks before his mysterious death, the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell summoned Kroll to his penthouse suite in the Helmsley Palace in Manhattan and asked him to investigate the "dark forces" he said were mobilizing against him -- "dark forces" that had nothing to do with the publisher's increasingly suspicious creditors. At the time of his death, Maxwell was working on a list of possible adversaries -- a list that, apparently, has disappeared. With the Maxwell family crying poverty, Kroll Associates is no longer on the case.
IF THE WORLD OCCUPIED BY Kroll Associates is sometimes under the spotlight, it is more often than not wrapped in shadow. Kroll and its prime competitor, Investigations Group Inc. (I.G.I.) of Washington, are widely regarded as the gold standard of financial private detection, but few of Kroll's clients are eager to show their faces.
Although Kroll Associates was conspicuously active on the Wall Street of the 1980's, the street's financial institutions are reticent about the private-eye firm. Merrill Lynch refused to discuss the subject. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley claimed that nobody in the company knew the faintest thing about Jules Kroll or his company. An executive at Goldman Sachs said that although the company had hired Kroll on occasion, he had no idea what they had done; the lawyers had handled it. At Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, one of the law firms in question, Arthur Fleischer Jr., the chairman, remarked that Kroll was "very good at what they did," and there the matter rested.
The reason for such evasion is simple: Few companies are willing to admit that they tried to sandbag an opponent with a private investigator, or that they had to call on his services because they had been sucker-punched by a white-collar criminal within their own ranks. And there are other compelling reasons for calling in Kroll: the speed with which it works (as contrasted with the overburdened police force) and its discretion.
Most of the work at Kroll Associates goes directly through 28 managing directors in offices in Washington, New Orleans, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, London and Paris. There is a joint venture in Hong Kong. Recently, Kroll created a consulting business in Eastern Europe with an established group, Planecon, which is heavily weighted with self-exiled, former Communist-bloc economists.
Kroll himself might take a personal hand in three or four high-profile cases a year. The Iraqi asset search was one; Russia is another. For Kroll, the Saddam Hussein and Russian cases are heartening proof that, in the pared-down world of the 1990's, his operatives would not have to make their living chasing ambulances and crashing through the doors of hotel rooms with flash cameras.
There are now a few corporate investigative agencies -- notably I.G.I. and Business Risk International (B.R.I.), based in Nashville -- but Kroll Associates has remained dominant in the field. By the middle of last year, it was a $50 million operation, twice the size of second-ranking B.R.I.
Kroll Associates has often been described as having done much to purge the investigative profession of a seedy image summed up in the mocking British phrase: the "dirty mac brigade." It taps into a huge and growing data base, and its immaculately dressed executives are top of the line. Besides Joseph Rosetti and Norbert Garrett, they include Brian Jenkins, a former Green Beret and for 17 years the international crime and terrorism expert at the Rand Corporation, and Robert J. McGuire, the former New York City Police Commissioner, who is president of Kroll Associates. Such men are able and well connected. (At Kroll, the managing directors are almost all male; the highest-ranking woman is the head of corporate communications and a managing director, Alice T. McGillion, a former First Deputy Commissioner in the New York City Police Department. Of the company's 40 investigators, 10 are women.)
Kroll's corporate advisory board, dissolved in late 1991 in a cost-cutting measure, consisted of similarly well-placed individuals and included former Ambassador Angier Biddle Duke and President Bush's brother Jonathan. At times, it is easy to forget that Kroll and his executives are, in fact, nothing more than a bunch of private eyes.
UNTIL THE GLORY DAYS OF the 1980's, there had never been a business like Kroll Associates. Almost anybody with rudimentary investigative skills can hang up a shingle, call himself or herself a private detective and hope for clients. But Jules Kroll made his name filling a new need. As Michael R. Milken, the junk bond wizard, created financial titans out of thin air, the entrenched powers of Wall Street came to a startling realization. They had no idea who these new guys were, and they didn't know where the sudden torrent of money was coming from -- important points when one was attempting to judge the legitimacy and soundness of a transaction.
Only a few years before, it was possible to find out about the people one was dealing with through a phone call or a discussion at the club with a financial counterpart one had known for years, or whose father one had known. But by the early 1980's, the old boy network that had quietly policed the nation's financial marketplace for half a century was no more, and the new environment was very unsettling. To find out what was going on, Wall Street turned to Jules Kroll.
An outsider was needed and Kroll's credentials were impeccable. He would be investigating his own kind: the self-made, the obscure, the guys from the outer boroughs who had not gone to the right schools, joined the right clubs or knew how to choose a proper bottle of wine.
Long before he became the owner of a waterfront estate in Rye, N.Y., Jules Barry Kroll was just another kid in Bayside, Queens, the son of a small-time printing entrepreneur. In 1967, after acquiring a law degree from Georgetown Law School (his undergraduate degree is from Cornell), Kroll joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office. After a year, because his father was ailing, he entered the family printing business, only to see it sold three years later. He was 30 years old, out of a job but, he hoped, on the brink of a new career in politics.
A Kennedy liberal (Kroll was an assistant to Robert F. Kennedy, then the junior Senator from New York, while attending Georgetown), Jules Kroll made a run for the New York City Council in 1971, with the backing of such seasoned liberal politicians as Robert F. Wagner Jr., Harrison J. Goldin and Robert Abrams. The campaign met the same fate as most other attacks on the formidable Queens Democratic machine of the 1970's. Kroll woke up on the morning after the election with no job and many debts. The family car was repossessed.
He formed J. Kroll Associates, whose purpose was preventive auditing, or purchasing control, a kind of police work in an industry where kickbacks, bogus suppliers and price fixing were almost taken for granted. Kroll's task was to keep the underlings of a company from stealing it blind and making sure that the customer got what it paid for. An early client -- and for a long time, his only client -- was Cadence Publishing, whose main product was Marvel Comics.
Kroll's knack for detective work was noticed. In 1979, Kroll Associates was hired to help in the defense of two major companies. One was Diamond International, a paper company then under attack by Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French entrepreneur. The other was Foremost-McKesson, a major distributor of wine, spirits and pharmaceuticals that had attracted the unwelcome attention of Victor Posner, the Miami corporate raider.
Sir James proved unstoppable, but Kroll operatives were able to help thwart Posner by sending aloft an aerial camera, whose pictures revealed that the raider was overstating the inventories at Sharon Steel, his primary vehicle for the proposed takeover. This, among other questionable activities, called Posner to the attention of the Internal Revenue Service, distracting him from his quest. (Subsequently, a Federal jury in Miami convicted Posner of income tax evasion.)
Suddenly, Kroll Associates, the corporate detective agency, was hot.
Corporations and government agencies had hired detectives often enough in the past. General Motors, for one, engaged private investigators to look into the personal life of Ralph Nader, when the consumer activist was publicizing the shortcomings of G.M.'s rear-engine Chevrolet Corvair. But a detective who could look at a potential investor and a pending deal and understand both -- that was rare indeed.
Drexel Burnham Lambert, one of the more flamboyant investment bankers on Wall Street, needed someone like Kroll. Drexel executives discovered early on in the takeover game that when it came to due diligence -- discerning the difference between a legitimate transaction and a cheap trick -- they weren't very good at it.
"You need people who can assimilate different kinds of complex information very quickly, analyze it and come back with creative ideas," says Terry F. Lenzner, a Washington-based former civil rights lawyer and Watergate prosecutor who blazed a distinguished trail of investigations himself before co-founding I.G.I. "Lawyers simply aren't trained to do that, and most of them don't know how."
By 1984, takeover-related investigations constituted three-quarters of Kroll's workload. But now and then, dirty hands and dirty mackintoshes were still called for, and Kroll Associates engaged in practices that were occasionally assailable.
A corporate raider like T. Boone Pickens was a tough opponent, but Pickens claimed that calling members of his private club and trying to obtain damaging information from his current and former employees constituted harassment. "We were conducting a perfectly lawful investigation," says Daniel E. Karson, general counsel of Kroll Associates. Pickens obtained an injunction in a Texas county court, forbidding Kroll from continuing its investigation; the court order was shortly thereafter thrown out, Karson says, by a Delaware court because the judge saw nothing wrong with Kroll's line of questioning.
Kroll operatives were accused of impersonating a reporter and a police officer while they were looking, on Goldman Sachs's behalf, into the affairs of Martin A. Siegel, the investment banker then under Federal investigation for passing along inside information. Jules Kroll denies this, although he concedes that Federal officers asked his operatives to stop harassing Siegel on the telephone. In James B. Stewart's book, "Den of Thieves," a Kroll operative was said to have bribed the Siegel family's baby sitter -- which Kroll also denies.
In an unrelated case, Justice Vincent Poppiti of the Delaware Superior Court forbade operatives from a Kroll subsidiary to conceal their identities and gave them a script to follow when they conducted interviews.
JULES KROLL IS A GREAT believer in bringing diverse disciplines to bear on an investigation. The case of the missing billions in Russia, for example, is expected to require many skills, including the services of the more than 500 outside consultants (behavioral researchers and independent private investigators among them) Kroll calls upon every year. This approach is used as well in the bread-and-butter cases that make up the bulk of Kroll Associates' business.
In investigating a routine white-collar crime, for example, Dan Karson, a specialist in this area, might assemble a team that includes several researchers, who would comb the enormous data bases, and a few investigators, usually ex-police officers, to do the legwork. Like most Kroll managers, Karson has the polished veneer of a business executive who happens to be a detective.
If the crime under investigation has been executed with sophistication, Karson will call on Kroll's extensive staff of investigative accountants, who are experts at detecting and analyzing intricate financial deceptions. And if time is of the essence, Karson will employ the company's accounting SWAT team -- the elite of the investigative accountants.
Well in advance of the changes in the marketplace, as the giddy 80's ended and the sober 90's began, Jules Kroll began to diversify. Environmental detective work is one developing area. It may involve nailing a company for dumping nitroglycerine in the municipal sewage system, or discovering if a client's prospective merger partner is doing so. Since the way in which companies had disposed of their toxic waste some 20 or 30 years ago almost never complies with today's laws, Kroll's operatives will find out, on behalf of various companies, what other companies had used the same waste dump, so that they can share the cost of the fines.
COMBATING urban terrorism is another new line of work.
On the afternoon of Sept. 9, 1991, a Monday, Howard Wallack, a senior vice president of Laidlaw Transit, called the Kroll office in Los Angeles with some arresting news: Three letters had been received, threatening to blow up Seattle's school buses on Friday, the 13th. The letters had been sent to Laidlaw, the principal bus contractor to the Seattle school district and a Kroll client; to the school board, and to the local news media. The bombs, said each of the letters, had already been placed in the buses' fuel tanks. The problem was Brian Jenkins's to resolve.
By nature a scholarly and contemplative man who reads Suetonius for relaxation, Jenkins has occasionally been bemused by the derring-do of the assignments that have come his way. A decorated captain who served in Vietnam in the Special Forces, his first task as a Kroll managing director -- on the night of a reception in honor of his appointment -- was to lead the lightning raid on the Phoenician Hotel and Resort in Phoenix. This lavish $300 million hotel was the crown jewel in the empire built by Charles H. Keating, the savings and loan executive who has since been indicted for fraud. Jenkins, a half-dozen other Kroll operatives and the Phoenix police successfully secured the Phoenician -- and all its financial records and papers -- for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
In the Laidlaw case, the local police conducted the day-to-day investigation while Jenkins had a team of behavioral experts examine the letters and draw up a psychological profile of the letter writer. Jenkins also hired a group of off-duty police officers to provide extra security for the Laidlaw buses. Following Kroll practice, he also assembled a crisis team.
Kroll's experts and the Seattle Police Department concluded that the bomb threat was a hoax, but there was no reason to treat it lightly. Laidlaw and its unionized drivers were in the middle of contract negotiations. At the same time, the city was tense over mandatory busing to integrate schools -- a particular flea in the ear of the writer of the letters.
When a local television station broke the news blackout on the threats, the Kroll team rolled out its crisis-control contingency plans. Meanwhile, Jenkins went to work to discover if there were bombs in the fuel tanks -- an obvious task but not an easy one, given the limited time.
"The buses were going to roll," Jenkins recalls. "Public attention was focused on them, and the authorities reminded us that the bombs were at least theoretically workable. Draining and disassembling the tanks in time was impossible. Specialized X-ray equipment might not work and wasn't available anyway. One of my colleagues, Mike Walt, a former F.B.I. agent with an undergraduate degree in zoology and graduate degrees in endocrinology and physiology, came up with an imaginative approach: How about an endoscope? If you can insert a tube with a tiny lens to examine a human organ, why not a fuel tank?"
After a little calling around, Jenkins came upon something called a borescope -- a device for inspecting the interiors of jet engines that was available from the nearby Boeing Company -- that fit the bill exactly. No bombs were found. The buses rolled on Friday with a minimum of disruption. Meanwhile, Laidlaw's fuel was found to be contaminated with bacteria, holding out the possibility of a profitable cleanup job for Kroll Associates' only subsidiary, Harrison/ Kroll Environmental Services, based in New Orleans.
American International Group, the large insurance company, has engaged Kroll Associates as a consultant in investigating international terrorism, cross-border crime and product tampering. Earlier this month, Kroll bought the Miami-based Palumbo Partners, which offers counterterrorist services and publishes a daily report on international terrorism for its subscribers.
Computer and communications crime is another promising field for Kroll. With its pioneering use of the latest computer technology in private investigation, the company is well positioned to enter a field that is particularly susceptible to the manipulations of the knowledgeable and unscrupulous.
"A law firm from the neighborhood called me," says Alan E. Brill, formerly in charge of computer security at the New York City Department of Investigations and now a Kroll technology specialist. "The administrative partner said he'd gotten a phone bill from his long-distance company. It came in a box. There were pages and pages of calls -- to Colombia, to Ecuador. He's used to a bill of around $4,000 a month. This one was $62,000. Unfortunately, the Federal Communications Commission says that if this happens to you, it's your problem." Brill told his client that to prevent a recurrence all he had to do was make a simple change in the software of the office's computerized telephone system.
"In every technology," Brill says, "there's a dark side that the hackers and the freakers of the world inhabit, and corporations never thought about the dark side."
Over the past year, a brisk new business has also developed in something called forensic accounting -- going back over the books of companies that were, in effect, mugged by their own employees during the 1980's when the companies were flush with money.
Today, business prospects look very bright indeed, and not just in the United States. "Sophisticated fraud in the United Kingdom is on a sharp increase and shows no sign of abating," says Patrick T. F. Grayson, a former British Army intelligence officer who heads the London office.
Where business fraud flourishes, so does Kroll Associates.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
Demolishing Myths About the Art of Ancient Japan

BYLINE: By Holland Cotter

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Behind its utilitarian title and strong archeological bias, "Ancient Japan" at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution sets some notable precedents for Japanese art in America. It is the first loan show from Japan to appear at the Sackler, and the first exhibition in the West devoted to that country's prehistoric art. More important, the 250 objects gathered here -- many of them of great beauty -- prompt a re-examination of long-held opinions about Japanese art.
They support, for example, the view that Japanese art is a highly synthetic phenomenon, assimilating foreign influences that enter its sphere. But they demolish the myth that it is fundamentally derivative, that it began only with the arrival of Buddhism from Korea and China and appropriated such techniques as lacquerware from continental Asia. "Ancient Japan" (through Nov. 1) confirms not only that a strong indigenous esthetic has always existed in Japan but that the melding of art and life for which the country is famous has roots deep in its own past. 
 Myths may, in fact, be the main reason that the material included in the exhibition has only been brought to light in the last two decades. Until World War II, Japan's official history insisted that the country's inhabitants had descended straight from heaven in the year 660 B.C. Any attempt by science to trace an earlier arrival time was, naturally, discouraged, and since Japan's largest prehistoric burial mounds are still regarded as imperial tombs, they haven't been excavated. With the continual digging to create new buildings and roads, however, the buried past has become unavoidable, and according to the excellent short documentary film at the entrance to this show, archeology has lately become a passion among the Japanese.
"Ancient Japan" is divided into five chronological sections: the Paleolithic, the Jomon, the Yayoi, the Kofun and the Asuka. The stone blades, adzes and scrapers in the first room are, like some of the other artifacts in the show, fairly short on visual interest (the guest curator, Richard Pearson, an anthropologist from the University of British Columbia, has wisely fleshed them out with photographs and texts), but with the Jomon period (10,500 to 400 B.C.), the show takes on the excitement of discovering a new and exotic art.
Jomon clay pottery constitutes the oldest known body of prehistoric ceramics in the world. In the earliest work, abstract surface designs were created by pressing twisted and knotted ropes into the wet clay. Later, relief elements -- pellets and clawlike rolls of clay applied before firing -- give the pots a vivid sculptural liveliness, with the same combination of ornament and accident favored by Japanese ceramics ever since. The outstanding pieces are those in which the lip of the vessel is elaborated into fantastic, openwork forms that reach upward like tangles of vegetation, leaping flames or elaborately wrought crowns.
By contemporary standards, these objects seem fit for a king. Yet the archeological record reveals that in the classless Jomon society these were cooking bowls used in daily life. The implication is clear that, millenniums ago, Japan was creating ordinary objects with the same degree of imaginative flair that it does today.
It is also interesting to note that while
Jomon ceramic styles appear to have been an exclusively Japanese phenomenon, other art of the period offers evidence of interactions between Japan and the rest of the world. Jomon lacquerware, for example, may have influenced the development of lacquerware in China, rather than the other way around, as is usually supposed. Jomon figurative sculptures raise tantalizing questions about more remote cultural influences. Tubular and doll-like, they were often ritually broken, but one that survives intact and is shown here has swollen, slitlike eyes that resemble the wood or bone goggles worn for protection against weather by the Inuits of North America today.
Although this trans-Pacific connection remained unexplored, there is little question that Japan experienced the influx of a new population, called the Yayoi after its pottery, around 400 B.C. These people seem to have brought with them a socially stratified society with an economic and religious elite. The Yayoi pieces in "Ancient Japan" include a new style of red-colored ceramics with bowls poised elegantly atop attenuated pedestals; here for the first time dishes for serving food and for eating it are differentiated. But the great objects here -- and they are among the most impressive Japan has ever produced -- are the cast bronze bells called dotaku.
Possibly derived from Korea, dotaku were first created to be rung and later were made strictly as esthetic objects. Their most striking feature is the fabric of patterns and images in low relief that plays over their surfaces. Amid curving lines like eddying water are scenes from rural life -- men fishing, women farming -- and remarkable depictions of wild animals, ranging from storks rendered with calligraphic economy to turtles seen as if in X-ray from above, to little beetles flitting across the surface of a pond. The proverbial presence of nature in Japanese art thus becomes brilliantly apparent in these prehistorical objects, and the distance between many of the images on these bells and those on 16th-century Momoyama screens seems slight indeed.
In the succeeding, Kofun period (A.D. 150-600), imperial Japan is to be found in its infancy. Studies of burial sites, including some of the great mound tombs called kofun, have revealed that great wealth was now concentrated in the hands of a few powerful rulers. Such wealth is typified by Chinese-inspired bronze mirrors and rich jewelry (including clunky, hoe-shaped bracelets that would look sensationally stylish today) displayed in the Sackler show, but the clearest impression of court life can be found in the hollow earthenware forms of humans, domestic animals, weapons and buildings called haniwa that were placed in processional formation atop tombs.
Although haniwa sculptures have long been familiar to American museumgoers, grouped together in the room at the Sackler they offer a stirring sight. Their schematic bodies range from two feet tall to lifesize, and their simplified faces -- anticipating, it would seem, the Noh masks of centuries later -- are extraordinarily expressive. A woman with a flat, bow-shaped coiffure and tiny feet might be a court beauty, though the bowl in her hand and the red pigment on her face suggest that she is a female shaman. Not far from her a dancing figure throws up his arms in an exuberant funerary dance; a warrior, his columnar body hidden behind his shield, stands at attention; a horse with an ornamental saddle waits stolidly nearby.
With the passing of the Kofun period and the beginning of the Asuka period (600-710), one can almost feel a change of gears in "Ancient Japan" as an archaic culture gives way to one well known to Western viewers. In place of the haniwa, the image of the Buddha, its graceful shape long developed and refined in China and Korea, prevails. Yet interestingly, the show plays down this transition. Anyone anticipating the climactic sight of one of the great Buddha groups of the Asuka period will be disappointed. In their place one gets more modest material: an eave tile in the form of a Buddhist lotus, a lovely little ink stone indicating the development of literature -- and written history -- under Buddhism, and the small bronze Miroku, or Buddha of the future, probably made for a portable shrine.
In the fresh perspective cast by "Ancient Japan," the Buddhist era was not, as it was once thought to be, the fountainhead of Japanese art. Rather, it was another station on what had already been a long, productive and incident-filled journey. Each of the earlier phases was, in its distinctive way, as spectacular as any that came before or after, and for the first time each has been given due attention.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
The Alchemy Needed to Rethink Times Square

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
Though the final curtain may not have fallen on Times Square Center, the massive office complex proposed for Broadway and 42d Street, news of the project's postponement has already begun to generate discussion about how Times Square should be rebuilt. Interest mounted two weeks ago, with the news that Robert A. M. Stern had been chosen to lead a design team that will create an "interim plan" for 42d Street pending further development of the area.
It would be a pity, though, if attention were focused solely on the architectural solutions to this blighted place. For what has arisen now is a spectacular opportunity to rethink the processes by which urban places are made. It's a chance to redefine relationships between the public, public officials, and the architects of public space. From these relationships, architecture arises. 
 With their uniform design of classical bases and mansard rooftops, the towers of Times Square Center were grotesquely wrong for a place that celebrates visual and social diversity. Even the architects, Philip Johnson and John Burgee, agreed. They went back to the drawing boards in 1988 and came up with somewhat snazzier packaging. But, in a way, the first design was better suited to the project's ruling mentality: a dated Victorian notion of authority.
That mentality was dramatically illustrated by an exchange that took place during the first public presentation of Times Square Center at a press conference in 1981. As the lavish models were unveiled, to the soothing strains of Pachelbel's Canon, a reporter noticed that the architecture bore little resemblance to the design guidelines commissioned by the New York State Urban Development Corporation at a cost of a quarter of a million dollars. The reporter asked Mayor Edward Koch why this was so. "I don't have to answer that question," the Mayor replied.
This wasn't just the usual Koch lip. Though the Mayor's accent was New York, his message was eminently Victorian. Silence is Golden. Don't speak until you're spoken to. Father knows best. And indeed the entire Times Square Center project was driven by a similarly authoritarian formula. Bring in the state, with its sovereign powers to sweep aside the city's public review procedures. Allow the developer to overrule the design guidelines. Hire the godfather of American architects to package the deal. Treat critics like public enemies: saboteurs, accessories to crime, antidevelopment zealots.
Obviously, design and development cannot be conducted by public referendum. The experience and expertise of politicians, developers and architects are major civic assets. But part of their expertise surely lies in the ability to enlarge the public's stake in important civic projects. Times Square needs more than political muscle. It takes cultural leadership to recognize the kind of place Times Square wants to be. This place does not want to be Rockefeller Center with traffic or Lincoln Center with neon. It wants to be an urban entertainment center for the year 2000: a place that could energize New York's cultural life for years to come.
And it takes cultural leadership to develop a solid base of public support. This process should not be left to P.R. experts and the wall of smiles they habitually construct between officials and the public. Such walls only incite the public to respond with a complementary display of frowns. It's up to officials and their architects to turn criticism into an occasion for dialogue. And that occasion is as important as the plan that sets it in motion.
The benefits of such a process could be architectural as well as political. For architecture, too, often remains mired in an authoritarian mode. Although Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Frank Gehry have offered more responsive approaches, too many buildings are stuck up there in the realm of "I don't have to answer that question." Mute formalism. Arcane theory. Period nostalgia. These current mannerisms do not speak to the conditions of contempory urban life.
Times Square is an ideal place to break through this communications barrier. For this Crossroads of the World has long been a symbolic intersection between art and communication. Here, advertising attains the dimension of a cultural monument, while theater sustains intermittent hope that art should aspire to broad popular appeal.
The best thing about the "interim plan" for 42d Street is that it will give architects a chance to learn from this crossroads. The plan, which is expected to be completed by January, has modest physical ambitions. It will contain guidelines for the renovation and re-use of buildings along 42d Street between Eighth Avenue and Broadway, including shops, restaurants, performance-art studios and at least two theaters. There will also be some opportunities for new buildings.
Robert Stern is not a bad choice for chief designer. The focus of Mr. Stern's writings on New York has always been urban as well as architectural. Now he will have a chance to realize a truly urban project. He brings to it an interesting mix of qualifications. As a writer and an architect, Mr. Stern has combined an aficionado's gusto with a showman's flair. His books on architectural history lend weight to a career that has sometimes seemed at risk of floating away with cartoon designs for the Disney Corporation. His writings suggest that New York's best days are behind it, that the architect's job today is to salvage the past from the relentless march of progress.
But given how close "progress" came to stamping out Times Square, it's not hard to sympathize with that position. Moreover, showmanship and connoisseurship will not be out of place in what is after all a job of architectural restoration and retail marketing.
It's a good sign that Mr. Stern has enlisted the collaboration of Tibor Kalman, head of the graphic design firm M & Co. Like Mr. Stern's, Mr. Kalman's intellectual roots can be traced back to Robert Venturi and his arguments for design as a form of mass communication. Unlike Mr. Stern, Mr. Kalman has given these ideas a forward spin, with his art direction for Interview magazine, his videos for Talking Heads and his eccentric designs for wristwatches.
Technically, Times Square Center is not dead. Like Freddie, this project may haunt us through years of grisly sequels. And there's a risk that the interim plan could itself become something monstrous. While it will not overwhelm the street with towering blockbusters, it could easily fall prey to the design overkill that afflicts festival marketplaces: too many banners, too much color coordination, too much programmed spontaneity. While the mix of architectural styles and commercial uses will encourage diversity, the overarching design plan -- and higher rents -- could work in the opposite direction, creating a theme park devoted to the "diversity thing." The designers are right to aim for diversity; the challenge they face now is to restrain their talents from subverting their intentions.

HEADLINE: Transition in the Baltic

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT; WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT is a correspondent in the London bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
IN a corner of the reception desk, in the sleek lobby of Riga's new Hotel de Rome, are two awkward-looking black boxes, each with a small whip antenna protruding from its top and a telephone handset clipped to its side. These are the house satellite phones, and for travelers staying at the hotel, they are the only working window on the world beyond Latvia. For about $5.40 a minute, depending on atmospheric conditions and sunspots, callers are able to do something they cannot do from the telephones in their rooms: make scratchy direct-dial calls to Western Europe or the United States.
With its well-stocked bars, polished multilingual staff and sun-splashed atrium, the 90-room Hotel de Rome is Latvia's finest hostelry, opened in December 1991. A joint venture involving a group of Latvian and German investors, and affiliated with Lufthansa, the German national airline, the hotel is a symbol of how life and times have improved for travelers to the Baltic states in the 10 months since they were given their independence from Moscow. But as business people and tourists who have traveled to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in recent months have discovered, the Baltic states still have a long way to go. 
 Independence may have redrawn old borders, but the Baltics remain part of a distinct and quite separate geographic region, one that they share with other former republics of the old Soviet Union. It is a kind of post-Soviet twilight zone, a land that is neither East nor West, where the political and economic rhetoric is utterly current, but the railroads, the airports, the telephones and most of the hotels still seem to operate as if it were 1955. The tension between what is different and what is not is especially acute in the Baltics, where the Russians have yet to withdraw more than 100,000 troops, a legacy of the days when the three republics were the nervous edge of the Soviet empire.
Indeed, traveling across the Baltics is only slightly easier, on the whole, than it was during the half-century that Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were under the heel of the Soviet Union. Back then, Intourist, the vast Soviet tourist agency, handled everything, from visas and travel intineraries to hotel reservations and ground transportation. The service and accommodations were miserable, but at least the traveler never had to worry about having to fend for himself or herself in some provincial outpost. The very idea of an unescorted American tourist on the loose in Riga was enough to give Intourist bureaucrats apoplexy.
Nowadays, travel here can be as uncertain and unnerving as it is in more remote areas of the world. It is only in the last year that there are hotels offering service and accommodations close to European or American standards, and the demand for them is so high that travelers who don't want to get shunted off to some cheerless Soviet-style lodging are advised to book well in advance and insist on some sort of written confirmation, by either telex or fax. Business people who work in the region all tell similar stories about arriving at the front desk after making a telephone reservation, and being told by the clerk that the only room available is a suite with private sauna -- for $300 a night. While Western airlines have added new flights, learning their schedules requires the cunning of a spy: the telephones at their local offices ring and ring, but often no one answers.
It seems, at times, there must be a critical shortage of telephone operators all across the region, a special frustration for overseas callers who have enough trouble getting a telephone to ring in the Baltics in the first place. One day last week, for example, no one was answering the number for reservations at the Hotel Latvia, despite repeated tries.
In Latvia and Lithuania, Russian rubles are still accepted as local currency, but that doesn't mean you can always spend them. If you try to pay a taxi driver with rubles, for example, he may feign horror, as if you were attempting to give him a small dead rodent. Dollars only, they insist. Like the newer hotels, a handful of new restaurants and taverns in the capital cities have opened that also insist on hard currency, rather than rubles, for payment. (In Estonia, the only legal tender accepted is the kroon, which was introduced as the national currency in June. Merchants are forbidden by law from accepting either rubles or hard currency.)
Meanwhile, no one seems to be able to agree on just what kind of travel documents are necessary. The Baltic Independent, an English-language newspaper published in Tallinn, recently pressed officials in Lithuania to explain their visa requirements for tourists and business people. The official reply: "It's better with a visa, but not necessary." Border controls -- in marked contrast to the old days, when grim Soviet officers appeared to regard each foreign passport as if it were a forgery -- are indifferent. At the Latvian border, our arrival by car only seemed to discomfit a Latvian guard, interrupting his midmorning reverie as he sprawled on a wooden bench, dozily listening to a large tape deck blasting a steady stream of Western rock and roll across the frontier into friendly Estonia.
Still, things are getting better. A Danish concern is planning to remodel the Lietuva, the largest hotel in Vilnius, and a Swedish group is spending $25 million to renovate the old Hotel Metropole in Riga, which it intends to reopen this fall as an 84-room luxury hotel. The same company has already taken over 56 rooms inside the old Riga, creating a hotel inside a hotel that is called Eurolink. The rooms have been completely rebuilt to European standards, including cable television and an adjoining bar and restaurant. In Estonia, Tallinn's Hotel Palace, the city's most comfortable, is operated by a Finnish hotel chain whose properties include Helsinki's Arctia Hotel.
Although none of the big international chains has come into the Baltics yet, several different groups of entrepreneurs are setting up private car rental services, and there is a wider range of restaurants than there was a year ago. (In Riga, a joint venture involving some American investors recently resulted in one of the Baltics' first fast-food restaurants, selling hamburgers and fried chicken.) Several large European and American telecommunications companies have even begun work on the tumbledown telephone system, which is still tied into the old Soviet network, requiring most overseas calls to be booked through an operator and shunted through Moscow, a process that is unreliable at best. Officials say some of the new international circuits will begin to come on line later this year.
Direct access to the Baltics is much easier these days. There are several nonstop air links between Western Europe and Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius. Riga, for example, has flights most days to and from Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Stockholm, Helsinki, Prague and Dusseldorf, as well as Moscow.
Baltic cruise ships now call regularly on ports in the three republics, and a small fleet of ordinary ferry boats and speedier hydrofoils commute daily between Tallinn and Helsinki, which are only 80 miles apart across the Gulf of Finland. In good weather, the hydrofoils make the crossing in less than an hour and a half, on sleek white-hulled boats whose interiors resemble airplane cabins; passengers are entertained by full-service bars and a television playing music videos.
Travel between the republics is somewhat more difficult. Although one tends to thinks of the Baltics as a geographic unit, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have distinct personalities, reflected in their separate languages, traditions and even architectural styles. While they share borders, and all back up to Russia, their faces are turned resolutely toward the Baltic, like neighbors on the same street whose relations with their next-door neighbors are cordial but frosty.
There is bus and rail service between the three capitals, but it is painfully slow. The train from Tallinn to Riga will take about eight hours, for example, but you can make the same drive by car in less than three. While some agencies rent cars you can drive yourself for about $150 a day, it's probably easier to hire a car with a driver, for about $200, particularly if you are traveling between the republics.
Here's a quick guide to some of the better hotels and restaurants in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania:
 
Tallinn
 The best hotel is the Palace, which was renovated in 1989 by a Finnish concern. As at other top-of-the-line hotels in the region, its 86 rooms and five suites are usually fully booked, so a reservation is absolutely necessary. The cable television system has both MTV and CNN, and the hotel advertises direct-dial telephones in the rooms, but it is, at best, a hit or miss proposition. In two days, I never got a call past the Estonian frontier. A single room, payable by credit card or kroon, the new Estonian national currency, is the equivalent of about $180.Telephone is (70142) 444761, fax (70142) 443098; one can also make reservations through a Finnish number, (3580) 6948022.
Second best is the 28-story Olympia, built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, when Tallinn was the venue for yacht and sailing competition. The 390 rooms range from about $88 to $140. Telephone (70142) 602438, fax (70142) 442521.
Tallinn has several fine restaurants, including the Baltics' first and only Indian restaurant, the Maharajah, (70142) 444367, just off the Town Hall Square in the old city. It is a bit stuffy and expensive, by local standards, with a three-course meal costing about $25. A few blocks away is Eesli Tall, (70142) 448033, a noisy local hangout where you will pay only about $2 or $3 for soup and a main course. It also serves Western wines and beers, which are more expensive.
 
Riga
 At the Hotel de Rome, singles start at about $150. There is a nice rooftop restaurant, Otto. Telephone (70132) 223171, fax, via Finland, (35849) 348175.
Across the square is the Latvia, an adventure in massive socialist architecture that has all the warmth of a bus garage, but serviceable rooms. Rooms begin at about $90. Telephone (70132) 229020, fax (70132) 283595.
The place to go in Riga is the Jever Bistro at 6 Kalku, a sleek tavern and restaurant in the old city. The Jever accepts only hard currency, and is a popular hangout for the city's fashionable set, including the growing population of Latvian-Americans.
 
Vilnius
 The Draugyste Hotel, beside Vingis Park, is a reliable standby, with many of its floors now occupied by diplomats and foreign business people while they search for permanent quarters. Its 200 Soviet-style rooms, complete with gigantic black and white television sets, are not the best, but service is generally good and the prices unbeatable. Bills are charged in rubles, and a single room starts at the equivalent of about $40. Telephone is (70122) 662711, fax (70122) 263101.
On the outskirts of town is the skyscraper Lietuva, built in the style of both the Olympia and the Latvia, with 747 rooms and 18 suites. Rooms start at about $65. Telephone (70122) 356016.
One of the best restaurants is Stikliai, (70122) 627971, at 7 Gaono Street in the medieval quarter. It's a favorite among diplomats and business people. The menu is in rubles, and a meal is less than $5.

Farmers Fighting Tax Reclassification

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IN the rural town of Morris, where 2,000 people occupy 18 square miles of Litchfield County's rocky hills, a dispute over a state law that permits preferential tax treatment for farms, forest land and other open space threatens to open a Pandora's box of lawsuits and land sales throughout Connecticut.
Public Act 490, sacred to farmers and large landowners since it was enacted in 1963, allows them to pay one-tenth the property taxes of ordinary property owners because they preserve open space and use almost none of the services required by residential and commercial development. 
 Three Morris farmers have sued the town for denying them continued tax abatement on parcels that they subdivided into building lots but did not sell or develop. When Harold Maddocks, the Morris tax assessor, removed those parcels from Public Act 490, the farmers' tax bills quadrupled.
Samuel Paletsky, one of the farmers, was charged $16,000 this year compared to $3,500 last year. Mr. Paletsky, who is 84 years old, subdivided 30 acres of his 125-acre farm into 11 lots ranging in size from 1 1/2 to 12 acres in 1977, before Morris adopted zoning regulations in 1979.
Nevertheless, his land was never reclassified until a total town revaluation was completed last year.
In the other cases, the two plaintiffs are Bernard Paletsky, Samuel's brother, who subdivided a single two-acre lot on his 150-acre tract, and James Greaves, who created three building lots on five-and-a-half acres of his 64-acre spread.
The lawsuits, filed in Litchfield Superior Court in May, state that the subdivisions exist only on paper, and since ownership and use of the land remain the same the preferential tax rate should prevail.
If the farmers lose in court, assessors around the state will have an opportunity to look at farmland differently. Having sole responsibility for qualifying farmland for Public Act 490, they could create a windfall of taxes. Affected property owners would have three alternatives: pay up, sue or sell.
"We believe that people will sell the land rather than pay the taxes," said Walter Welz, director of information for the Connecticut Farm Bureau, an association of farmers founded in 1919. "We think the law is clear, that never-developed subdivisions with no roads, no houses, are protected. Through the 80's, when prices peaked, the Paletskys could have made a killing. But they didn't."
Farmers, he explained, may be "capital rich," but they are "liquid poor."
"Taxes at the level Morris is requiring are a threat to farm ownership," he said, "except for the wealthy -- the affluent hobbyist or gentleman farmer, but not the working farmer of modest means."
According to Michael Rybak, the town's lawyer, that argument is beside the point. "These are not farms, they are inventory for sale," he said. "When [Samuel] Paletsky subdivided his land he did so knowing that the town was on the verge of adopting two-acre zoning. Most of the lots are under two acres. He can't have it both ways -- saying I have building lots to sell, and turning around to the assessor and saying this is farmland. He only uses it for the grazing of horses."
TWO court cases relevant to the dispute in Morris occurred some time ago. In 1967 a partial zone change was sought for a farm named Waldenron in South Windsor. One parcel that was still being farmed was reassessed at the industrial rate. And in 1979 Canterbury Farms sued the Town of Waterford because the assessor fully taxed a house lot that was still being farmed. "In both cases the court found in favor of the farmer," said Ms. Standish.
"When subdivisions are filed but nothing is done with them, we disregard them. The land remains under Public Act 490," she said. Disputing the contention that grazing operations are not farming, she said, "growing feed for livestock and horses is legitimate agriculture."
A similar subdivision case recently surfaced in Bethlehem, just south of Morris. "We decided that the property could remain under Public Act 490 and still be partially subdivided," said Charles Parmelee, who serves on a three-man elected Board of Assessors. "Morris has problems," he said. "I prefer a board because you have three minds working instead of only one."
Steven Paletsky, Bernard Paletsky's son, attempted to create a similar system in Morris by petitioning a town meeting in June to switch from a single appointed assessor to an elected board of assessors.
"About 270 people showed up and resoundingly turned him down," said Philip Birkett Jr., the First Selectman. "Mr. Maddocks became our assessor in 1990, with 30 years experience behind him. His position on 490 is his own, backed by the Board of Tax Review and by me."
Norval Lunan, chairman of the Board of Tax Review, to whom the landowners appealed their assessments before resorting to the courts, said "We based our decision on the premise that the law is meant for the preservation of farmland, forest land and open space. These people have no intention of preserving it. They can reinstate their 490 status by eliminating the subdivisions, but they declined to do so."
He added that "with the state holding back money, communities have to re-evaluate their tax base."
"Problems with 490 have increased in the past year or so," said Mr. Welz at the Farm Bureau. "Cuts in revenues from the state, the correlated increase in town budgets and the slow economy have made towns uneasy. They are scrutinizing the tax base and perhaps unfairly singling out 490 lands."
ON Aug. 18 Judge Walter M. Pickett Jr., of the Superior Court in Litchfield, acted on Mr. Rybak's motion to dismiss the three cases. He granted partial dismissal because the plaintiffs' papers were filed a day late by their lawyer, Peter Litwin of Litchfield, who is on vacation and could not be reached.
In addition, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs filed incorrectly for reclassification as farmland instead of filing for overvalued acreage. But he let stand a charge of unlawful assessment, which permits him to set a date for trial within one year.
Mr. Rybak has two weeks to consider further motions. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs intend to pursue their cases. "We will not give up," said Samuel Paletsky's son David. "Farmers don't do that."

HEADLINE: New Housing At Lowest Since '85

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
THE once frenetic pace of housing construction in New York City has slowed to a virtual halt over the last three years, impeded by the lingering recession, a dearth of Federal funds and a bureaucratic bog of rent and land-use regulations.
Housing experts are unsure exactly how many new units are needed today. They contend, though, that despite attempts by the administrations of Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins to stimulate both construction and rehabilitation, vast numbers of affordable homes for low- and middle-income residents need to be built, particularly in the outer boroughs. 
 "The issue, once you get beyond the absolute numbers, is price, and there is a substantial segment of the population that can't afford to pay rents that cover the costs of housing," said Charles Brecher, director of research at the Citizen's Budget Commission. "It's an income problem as much as a housing problem."
New housing production, according to the Department of City Planning, has been declining for each of the last three years, falling to 7,639 units in 1991, the lowest level since 1985. Manhattan had the most housing starts last year: 2,595. It was followed by Queens, which had 1,996, and Staten Island, which had 1,628. Brooklyn and the Bronx had the fewest, 764 and 656, respectively.
The decline is not a short-term aberration. The annual average of 10,276 units completed between 1981 and 1991 was only a third of the average of 34,800 new units built from 1961 to 1970, when substantial Federal aid was available.
The Planning Department figures on housing are based on final certificates of occupancy. Buildings under construction or occupied under a temporary certificate of occupancy are not counted. The figures also do not include units that have become occupied because of conversions from other uses or rehabilitation, the method by which much of what little new housing there is today is being created in the city. Indeed, in 1991, more apartments -- 7,800 -- were rehabilitated by the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development than were newly built in the entire city.
"If you look at housing starts in the city, it is frightening," said Will L. Zeckendorf, vice president of the Zeckendorf Company, one of the largest residential developers in the city. "There is virtually nothing being built now. In 1991, we built fewer units than Peoria, Ill."
The slowdown in construction has hit not only housing for low- and moderate-income residents, but also the segment of the market that developed the most feverishly during the 80's -- Manhattan luxury units, particularly condominiums. In 1991, there were 950 condominiums and 725 rental apartments built in Manhattan. This year, that number should drop to 300 condominiums and 700 rentals.
"It is getting down to nonexistent," said Yale Robbins, president of Yale Robbins, a real estate publishing and consulting concern. "There are buyers of units out there. There are also enough apartments to satisfy these buyers."
The lack of new construction is not limited to the city. Rosemary Scanlon, the chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that the 18,000 units built last year in the 17-county metropolitan region including the city was about 70 percent lower than in 1985.
"WE have had six consecutive years of decline," she said. "To build 18,000 units for an area of 15.5 million households is a minuscule amount."
"In Los Angeles, they built 112,000 units for an area with a population of 11 million," Ms. Scanlon added. "And our best year in the last 20 was 1985, when we built 64,000."
No studies have been done since 1985 to determine the size of the city's housing gap -- the difference between the number of existing units and the number needed to house its population and maintain a 5 percent vacancy rate. That 1985 report, sponsored by the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development, estimated the gap at 622,600 units, 391,600 to be obtained through moderate rehabilitation of existing units and 231,000 through new construction or gut rehabilitation. There are 2.9 million existing housing units in the city, according to 1990 census figures.
A report in 1984 by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal found the city needed 630,000 more units, 446,000 through moderate rehabilitation and 184,000 in new construction.
The next projection, part of the city's triennial vacancy report, will not be released until the end of the year.
"There are still severe problems," said Michael A. Stegman, chairman of the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who conducts the study.
At least 10,000 units should be built each year merely to replace older units, said Mr. Zeckendorf. "Even if we don't need more units, a healthy city should be replacing its older housing stock," he said. "We have a lot of older housing in the city, and out of our total we should be replacing 1 to 2 percent every year."
Aside from the issue of the number of units needed, there is also an affordability gap. "The issue is the allocation and the cost of housing relative to people's ability to pay, as much as it is the sheer quantity of housing," Mr. Stegman said.
Though the New York metropolitan area's median family income rose 76 percent, to $36,900, in 1990 from $20,919 in 1981, the median price of an existing home rose by almost twice as much -- by 133 percent -- to $172,000 in 1991, from $73,800 in 1981.
Even with today's low interest rates, a family with the 1991 median income would need to make at least a $17,200 down payment on the median-priced home, which would be equal to 47 percent of its annual income. It would also have to pay 41 percent of its income to meet mortgage payments on a 9 percent, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, not including taxes and other costs.
"The affordability gap is probably widening at this point," said Felice Michetti, Commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "We are seeing fewer and fewer low-rent units, and there is tremendous pressure on the rents. Where there have been increases in supply, it is just feeding the high end."
Most optimistic analysts lay the construction slowdown to the recession and the difficulty of getting credit and look forward a comeback sparked by a revival of the economy.
"The drop in housing production in New York City in the last two years reflects the slowdown in the local and national economies," said Richard L. Schaffer, the director of the Department of City Planning. "However, as the city emerges from the recession, falling interest rates may provide an incentive for new housing construction."
Others, though, point to entrenched structural problems, not only in the economy but also with the housing that is built and allocated in New York.
Peter D. Salins, a professor of urban planning at Hunter College, cited, in particular, the city's decades-old system of rent-regulation. He said that although housing shortages often motivate the impulse to regulate, regulation only exacerbates a shortage.
"Rent regulation discourages the developer because it may build housing that falls under its regulation," he said.
Mr. Salins added that rent regulation in New York reduces the number of people who trade up to homeownership or better apartments because rent-regulated apartments are priced too low to leave.
"You need a vigorous market of people looking for new housing to spur construction," he said. "You have to create a market for the stock by getting people to move from wherever they are right now."
HE also said that rent regulation, besides underhousing New Yorkers in quality and size, unjustly misallocates housing by creating a two-tier system that provides inexpensive regulated apartments for the vested, or long-term resident of the city, and higher priced units for newcomers.
The lack of a means test for rent-regulated apartments also means that some low- and middle-income residents pay more for housing in the open market than affluent residents living in rent-controlled or rent-stabilized apartments.
"New York has plenty of low-income housing," Mr. Salins said. "It's just that high-income people live in it."
Angelo J. Aponte, the New York State Director of Housing, disagreed that rent-regulation was a signifcant factor in the construction slowdown. He noted that rent-regulation does not apply to buildings built after 1974, unless they take part in a city subsidy or tax-abatement program, which many do. Instead, he cited the regional economic downturn and the drying up of commercial credit.
"There are no new buildings going up in New York City," he said. "We are in a real estate depression -- not a recession, a depression."
Apart from rent regulation, the city also has created a web of zoning constraints, environmental review procedures and site assemblage laws that hinder housing construction.
"WE have such a crippling regulatory atmosphere," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, a 10-year-old nonprofit collaboration of government officials, builders, bankers and business leaders. "The costs have really offset the falling interest rates and the increased demand."
Local officials, though, note that direct Federal assistance for housing declined by 60 percent between 1981 and 1989. Further, Federal tax shelters available in the early and mid-1980's for those who built or financed real estate projects, have largely disappeared.
The tax breaks, which let people sharply reduce their taxes by declaring passive losses, were largely eliminated with the revision of the tax codes in 1986, but not before drawing projects into development that were not completed until later.
"For a very long time before the weak rental market came in, we had a buildup of supply at the same time there was diminishing demand," Ms. Michetti said. "And that slows down or halts the construction of new units."
During the 1980's, the city responded to the dwindling amount of Federal assistance by creating several programs. Most of them, however, have not been as successful as hoped.
For example, the city's 421a program, which offered tax abatements to developers of new housing and was started early in the decade, was eliminated below 96th Street in Manhattan in December 1985, although developers could transfer abatements to lower Manhattan from affordable projects elsewhere in the city.
The restriction of the program also created a construction spurt from 1986 to 1989 by builders who raced to put in their foundations before the end of 1985. Unfortunately, many of the projects were completed just as the city's residential market began to slump after the stock market collapse in 1987.
Another example is the city's Battery Park City program, which was unveiled by Mayor Koch in 1986. The program was supposed to rehabilitate 24,000 derelict buildings by using $1 billion in profits from some of the luxury units built in Battery Park City in lower Manhattan. Thus far, though, the program has raised only $210 million, $143 million of which has been used to rehabilitate 1,122 completed units.
An additional $220 million was raised in the bond market in 1990, but the Dinkins administration used the money to close a budget shortfall. Moreover, investors are also uneasy about buying Battery Park City Authority bonds because of the financial problems associated with the project's largest tenant, Olympia & York.
MORE successful has been the city's $5.1 billion capital plan, which was announced in 1986 and is projected to have ready for occupancy 250,000 rental and owned units through gut rehabilitation of vacant and abandoned units, new construction and the moderate rehabilitation of existing units. About half of the total number of units have been completed, including 45,000 of the 53,000 gut rehabilitations.
The state has also contributed financial and administrative assistance to spur construction in the city. Between April 1, 1989, and April 1, 1991, 2,878 new housing units were completed using state money or Federal funds administered by the state.
Even so, the current shortage of new construction represents what Louis Winnick, a housing analyst with the Fund for the City of New York, called "a genuine bust" in housing. "The last one was in the 1960's," he said.
"This is a down cycle in a down trend," he added. "And the combination is fairly lethal."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Ferry Terminal Design;
6 Chosen for Competition

 BODY:
Six firms have been chosen to compete for the commission of designing the Whitehall Ferry Terminal -- better known as the Staten Island ferry terminal -- in lower Manhattan. The existing terminal was badly damaged by fire last year; its replacement will cost $112 million
The competitors, selected by city officials from a field of 54, are Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates; James Stewart Polshek & Partners; Aldo Rossi Studio di Architettura; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; Rafael Vinoly Architects and a joint venture of Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates and Anderson/Schwartz Architects. All of the teams are based in New York or have New York offices. 
 "Any one of them would be able to design an extraordinary new terminal which will provide a major new architectural statement," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, sponsors of the competition and managers of the construction project, which is expected to take five years. A winner is to be picked in November by a jury headed by Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the development agency. Other jury members are city officials, design professionals, a museum director, a civic leader and an architecture critic.

HEADLINE: Nonprofits Did Many of the Rehabilitations

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
MANY of the rehabilitated housing units completed within the last few years in New York City were the result of efforts by nonprofit community development groups like the Mid-Bronx Desperados and organizations like the New York Equity Fund, the Local Iniataives Support Corporation and the Enterprise Foundation.
Five years ago, the Crotona Park East section of the South Bronx was perhaps best known for its blocks and blocks of bombed-out buildings. Since then, however, virtually all of the abandoned buildings in the area have been renovated into affordable apartments for the working poor and the homeless -- largely because of the efforts of the Desperados and the Equity Fund, the largest private provider of financing for low-income housing in the city. 
 "A neighborhood that was a symbol of devastation is now a neighborhood that has been brought back to life," said Marc Jahr, the New York program director for the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a national non-profit group, which along with the Enterprise Foundation of Columbia, Md., created the Equity Fund.
Earlier this summer, the Desperados began renovating the last city-owned abandoned buildings in their neighborhood. "We are doing 65 units in four buildings," said C. Ralph Porter, the group's president.
Part of the financing -- $2.4 million -- for the $7.5 million project will come from $35 million in investment capital the Equity Fund received from four New York-based banks to help rehabilitate city-owned vacant buildings in low-income areas. Three banks, Bankers Trust J.P. Morgan & Company and Republic National Bank are investing $10 million each. The Bank of New York is contributing $5 million.
THE $35 million, more than half the Equity Fund's 1992 goal of $60 million, will be used by the Desperados and 12 other community-development groups to create 702 apartment units for 14 projects in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant, East New York and Crown Heights in Brooklyn; East Harlem and Manhattan Valley in Manhattan and Morissania, Crotona Park and Longwood in the Bronx.
The Equity Fund operates by exchanging tax credits for equity under the five-year-old Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, the nation's primary source of Federal aid for producing low-income housing. In New York City alone, the program, also used by other organizations, has helpedcreate more than 12,000 low-income apartments.
Since the fund's inception, it has raised $153 million, $46 million of it last year. The fund uses this equity to leverage additional public and private financing. Working with nonprofit developers, the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal and the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, it has helped create more than 3,250 units of affordable housing.
"The future of our city depends on these public-private partnerships," said Stephen M. Porras, fund manager of the Equity Fund. "Part of the frustration out in L.A. clearly had to do with the lack of opportunity."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Manhattan Supermarkets;
Space Shoppers Discover Bargains on the Shelves

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
EVERYONE agrees on the barebones fact: John A. Catsimatides, chairman of Red Apple Companies, has renewed the lease on the 8,000-square-foot space used by his Sloan's supermarket at 1343 Lexington Avenue, at 89th Street. But as for the details -- well, its Rashomon, real estate style.
Koeppel & Koeppel, which owns the building, says it is getting $55 a square foot, as well as 45 percent of any increase in real estate taxes. "In Manhattan, good supermarket space is rare, and the rarer the commodity, the better the rent," said William W. Koeppel, a partner. 
 Mr. Catsimatides, who is also the chairman of the ailing First New York Bank for Business, says he gained enough givebacks to bring the actual rent "substantially under $30" over the next five years, and to keep it below $40 for the 15-year life of the lease. "This is a good time to negotiate with landlords," he said.
Probably neither side feels particularly fortunate right now. New York landlords are having little trouble finding supermarkets to occupy cavernous (by Manhattan standards, upwards of 8,000 square feet) spaces -- but at rents well below what they are asking. And many of the hard-hit supermarket chains say that even $40 a square foot -- the average rent for supermarket space in Manhattan -- is beyond what they can pay. Some have put expansion plans on hold, while others have rented basements, garages and mezzanines, all in hopes of keeping rents down.
"Landlords are still asking $65 and $70 a square foot, but they're agreeing to formulas that bring it down to a lot less," said Linda Sue Wolff, a store leasing specialist at New Spectrum Realty.
In flusher times, many residential co-ops spurned supermarkets in favor of so-called "dry" operations that yielded fewer objectionable odors and vermin and a lot more prestige. And co-ops and commercial landlords alike discovered that, by cutting huge spaces into smaller parcels, they could replace one supermarket paying, say, $38 a square foot in rent with four quality stores willing to pay $70.
Late in 1986, for example, a small store adjoining an 8,000-square-foot A. & P. on Madison Avenue and 87th Street came up for rent. The A. & P. wanted to expand, and offered the landlord $50 a square foot for the space, ten times what they were paying for the market. "He simply laughed," recalled Michael Rourke, an A. & P. vice president. He had reason to: Mr. Rourke said a shoe store rented the space for roughly $90 a foot.
Those $90 rents are history in most areas, and landlords are again looking to supermarkets to pick up the slack. But many of the spaces have been carved up beyond repair -- Mr. Koeppel, for one, guesses that half the supermarket space in Manhattan disappeared in the 80's. And supermarkets cannot pay top dollar for the spaces that are left.
THE supermarkets are facing a killing recession of their own. Although cash-strapped consumers are eating home more, they are eating cheaper. That means pasta instead of steak, private labels instead of premium brands, fewer second helpings, and maybe forget the dessert. The Food Marketing Institute says that the national average per-customer supermarket receipt in fourth-quarter 1991, the most recent figure available, was $17.79, 5 percent below fourth quarter 1990's $18.64.
Supermarkets, which operate on margins of less than 1 percent even in the best of times, simply cannot absorb this new spartanism. Small chains, like Sloan's Supermarkets, are being forced to sell stores. That's how Mr. Catsimatides was able to buy the Sloan's on Lexington Avenue at 89th Street for his company six months ago. Larger chains are scaling back. At one time the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company had more than 50 stores in Manhattan. Today, it has 28.
Nonetheless, vacant supermarkets remain a rare sight. Sloan's had no trouble unloading 20 of its 31 supermarkets in Brooklyn and Manhattan, to Red Apple and other more prosperous chains that wanted the long-term leases or the locations. "People aren't buying up Sloan's for the business or the customers, but for the real estate," said Edward A. Friedman, president of Newmark Retail Services. "There are not enough affordable big spaces for supermarkets in this town."
New York is a mirror, albeit a distorted one, of the supermarket situation throughout the country. Nationally, only 6.7 percent of stores were remodeled last year, compared to 9.1 percent the year before, according to the Food Marketing Institute. And new stores accounted for only 2.9 percent of the 30,670 supermarkets extant last year, compared with 4 percent in 1990. So clearly, the recession has had a dampening effect on supermarket expansion everywhere.
Still, analogies between the rest of the nation and New York, where rents for cramped basements are nearly four times the national rate of $8 to $12 for typical 40,000-square-foot stores, can go only so far.
New York City shoppers expect markets to be within walking distance, so supermarkets can safely locate within a few blocks of each other. And, with large chains like A. & P. and Red Apple operating popular-priced and premium-priced stores under different names (A. & P. owns Food Emporium and Waldbaum's, Red Apple owns Gristedes), supermarkets that might appear to be competing are often working hand in hand to serve different income groups in the same area. Selling to what is pretty much a captive audience, they can charge prices high enough to compensate for their swollen rents.
All those factors made New York supermarkets willing to gamble on locations in prerecession days. A few years ago, Mr. Catsimatides opened a Red Apple and a cramped Gristedes in Battery Park City, expecting that the huge upscale development would grow by three or four more buildings and at least 4,000 more families. It didn't, and the stores' revenues are far below expectations. "We're a lot more cautious now," said Mr. Catsimatides. "We wouldn't open stores today in a location that didn't look like it would pay off right away."
Supermarkets have gotten pickier on types of space, too. For a time, it looked as though basements would be a good compromise for supermarkets hungry for new stores at bargain rents. But that trend was predicated on rents for existing street-level spaces remaining very high, and on lots of new buildings going up, built with basement stores in mind.
NOW supermarket executives have rethought the basement idea. "Basements only made sense when street-level space cost $100 a foot," said Mr. Catsimatides, who pays about $30 a foot rent for a Red Apple basement store on West 86th Street. Basements have lost their allure for more subtle reasons, too. "We get the feeling that New Yorkers would rather walk a few extra blocks than shop in a basement," said Jules F. Rose, Sloan's president.
Supermarkets are also less willing to shoehorn themselves into tiny spaces. For one thing, they need to stock more frozen food, reduced-calorie items and fresh produce to attract a convenience-minded, health-conscious populace. For another, the many bank consolidations and large store closings have made more large spaces available. "We won't even look at anything less than 8,000 square feet today," said Mr. Rose of Sloan's.
For now, the question of where supermarkets will or will not locate is moot. Supermarket executives say that, if their receipts are any indication, the recession shows no sign of abating any time soon. And when it does, many chains may have to use any improvement in their cash flow to remodel or maintain existing stores before they think about building new ones.
Still, there are isolated signs of expansion, particularly outside of Manhattan. A. & P. just opened a 55,000-square-foot Waldbaum's, complete with parking, two blocks from Yankee Stadium. And it opened a 60,000-square-foot Waldbaum's in Queens Village, in an old Macy's furniture warehouse.
And considering the continuing scarcity of supermarkets in Manhattan, activity, albeit on a smaller scale, will probably pick up there soon, too. "If you have an underserved market you get stores opening up," said Debra Levin, a supermarket analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It's that simple."

HEADLINE: ART;
Politics and Artists, Then and Now

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

 BODY:
THE perspective provided by a show at the Katonah Museum of Art should prove valuable to voters "coming down" from the conventions. Titled "In Good Conscience: The Radical Tradition in 20th-Century American Illustration," the exhibition proposes in the clearest possible terms that while times change the issues remain the same.
It was organized for the museum by Bernard Reilly Jr., head curator of prints and photographs at the Library of Congress. 
 Imperialism, war, capital punishment, unemployment, destitution, racism -- all the ills are here (except drug addiction, abortion and AIDS) that artists have been covering all century long. In 1927, for example, Hugo Gellert did a collage for a New Masses cover that involved a map of Mexico, a compass in the form of a skull and crossbones and the legend, "Is oil thicker than blood?"
If there is a difference between then and now it is in the more impassioned styles of earlier artists. John Sloan comments on the massacre that ended a strike at the John D. Rockefeller Fuel and Iron Company in Ludlow, Colo., with a brisk 1914 sketch in black chalk of a miner who stands in a wrecked house grasping a dead child and firing a handgun. Reflecting similar outrage, Robert Minor sums up the Pittsburgh steelworkers strike of 1916 with an equally swift chalk sketch of a man impaled on the bayonet of a National Guardsman.
Compared with these, Sue Coe's "War" (1991) is tame stuff, being a neat design of a woman with head bowed and a sea of gas-masked faces under a sky black with warplanes. Nor does the pulse beat faster at the sight of Marshall Arisman's "Old Man on Park Bench Eating Dog Food" (1977); the artist has devoted too much care to the can opener lying beside the man.
Since industrialization and the population growth it fosters are its chief prerequisites, the art of political and social comment developed later in the United States than in Europe. Daumier, a caricaturist who was jailed for his pains, and Gustave Dore had long since made their marks by the time Thomas Nast began contributing to Harper's Weekly. Mr. Reilly notes in his brochure introduction that the German-born Nast was the first social critic in American art, but that he was "less a champion of the common man than a loyal advocate of republican ideology."
It was left to Robert Henri and the Ashcan painters to focus on the ever-widening gap between rich and poor, and they, in turn, passed the baton to The Masses, which had Sloan for art editor and artists like Minor, George Bellows and the young Stuart Davis for contributors. The Masses died in 1917, but the dissent continued -- notably in The Nation, which employed Adolf Dehn and Louis Lozowick, among others, and of course in The New Masses.
Not surprisingly, the vintage period for dissent in this show extends from the mid-1920's to the mid-1930's. Reginald Marsh reports sedately on bread lines (for a New Yorker of 1928), Philip Evergood on derelicts (1932), James Daughterty on police brutality (1932) and Paul Cadmus on lynching (1925). More interesting esthetically, however, is Philip Guston's 1930 drawing of a Ku Klux Klan hanging, because it all but proves the artist's 1970's departure from Abstract Expressionism to figuration to have been a reversion.
Jacob Lawrence speaks for the 1950's with a large gouache of a window that has flies and a dead mouse on the inside and gives on to a view of tenements packed tighter than sardines in a can. Ben Shahn does the same with a revised pen-and-ink version of his famous 1931-32 painting, "Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti."
After this, and despite fine drawings by Antonio Frasconi and David Levine, the show loses momentum. It would appear that the most eloquent commentators of the last 30 years have been photographers.
After closing here on Sept. 27, the show travels to the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College.
Also at the museum is a retrospective by Alan Cober, who is dubbed "The Artist as Illustrator, the Illustrator as Journalist." The guest curator for this is Steven Heller, who is editor of the A.I.G.A. Journal of Graphic Design and Design and Style, as well as a senior art director at The New York Times.
The recipient of numerous graphic arts awards, Mr. Cober is currently a professor of art and distinguished visiting artist at the State University of New York at Buffalo. His other accomplishments include covers for Time and Newsweek, posters, a mural for the National Museum of American History and a book on Willowbrook, the state mental hospital, that is titled "The Forgotten Society." He covered the 1980 Presidential election.
Mr. Heller calls him a "maverick" who "played a crucial role in changing the practice and perception of commercial and editorial illustration." To an outside observer, however, Mr. Cober is part of the figural trend that has its roots in Picasso, Goya, the German New Objectivity Movement and the sculpture of Marino Marini. Named the "Outsider Movement" by the historian Selden Rodman, the mode took on in the United States after World War II only to be shunted aside by Abstract Expressionism.
It is a heroic form of realism that seems always to be pointing to a moral and it has attracted artists from Jose Luis Cuevas to Rico Lebrun and Leonard Baskin and may now be attracting a new generation of painters and sculptors. Nevertheless, its influence seems to have been strongest in the graphic world.
Whether working with pencil and watercolor, pen and ink or an etching needle, Mr. Cober is ever the rigorous draftsman but with a highly subjective approach. The 1975 portraits of the aging Joe Louis in pen and colored inks are evidently faithful to life; but the "villain" of the 1980's, Michael Milken, is depicted as a junkie mainlining money.
Mr. Cober frequently departs without warning into his own Surrealist imagination, as in the profile of a man whose nose is metamorphosing into crab's legs and in the portrait of himself wearing the shell of a horseshoe crab. There are few images not tinged with the bizarre, whether it is the beautifully worked portrait heads on shriveled bodies or the men wearing hats, tight overcoats and masks who are forcing Martin Luther King away.
The artist, however, can produce amazingly cool drawings of machinery. Indeed, the key to understanding Mr. Cober's mind may well be in the labyrinthine hand-colored etchings of engines.
This show remains on view through Sept. 27. Call 232-9555 for information.
"Warnings," at Nardin Fine Arts in Cross River, was to have been a companion to the Cober show, but for reasons unclear has metamorphosed into an anthology of paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture and photographs, and the same title serves. As with the "Conscience" exhibition at Katonah, the time span is considerable, but the artists are contemporary, most of them living in Westchester.
Anthony Toney is represented by a watercolor or two homeless women, dated circa 1937; his daughter, Anita, by a fairly recent Rouaultish-looking lithograph of three men titled "Highlights 3, Age." Paul Pascarella takes issue with humanity in 1990's paintings of a predatory bird, one titled "Desert Storm." Hananiah Harari, on the other hand, mocks it with his circa 1950 vision of an old man in evening dress doing a "Miss Haversham" in a room cluttered with mementos, including a giant Victrola.
Also noteworthy in the fine art department are the delicate watercolor of a wood thrush lying dead in tall grass, by Donald Mackay, and Leonard Beall Smith's bird carried in black basalt, both from the early 1970's.
Claire Yaffa, a Social Realist photographer in black and white, focuses on infant burials in Potter's Field. Geoff Kerrigan is more the moderate in his black-and-whites of prison visitors, but he tries for a concentration camp effect in the print of a woman holding a baby up to a barbed-wire fence. The photographer who scores highest is Barbara Brundage, with two black-and-whites, one of a crack baby no bigger than the hand of the nurse holding it and with the face of an old man, the other of a car speeding past a dead deer.
All the photographs seem to be recent, likewise Bill Delaney's "Pipe Dream," boxed under glass. An assemblage that intimates warnings of a wittier kind, it consists of a pipe that emits a cutout reproduction of an Ingres nude instead of smoke.
The show remains through Sept. 1. Call 763-8451 for information.

HEADLINE: MAKING A DIFFERENCE;
Gambling on the Gulf Coast

BYLINE: By VERONICA BYRD

 BODY:
When he starts his job Tuesday as the new chief of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, Lorenzo D. Creighton says, his first assignment will be to listen.
By hearing what his staff and state gambling officials have to say, "I will have a much better feel for what is needed in order to make the administration run smoothly," Mr. Creighton said. "I want people to feel comfortable. I want to hear their feedback." 
 Riverboat gambling along the Mississippi River started in the spring of 1991. Dockside gambling began Aug. 1 on the Gulf Coast.
While gambling "is not the cure-all" for the state's economic ills, Mr. Creighton said, "when you look at the various businesses that spring up around riverboat gambling operations, it's clear gaming can be a strong economic force in the community."
He acknowledges that not everyone has warmly embraced the return of riverboat gambling and says there is a delicate balance in regulating the industry.
"A lot of people out there are anti-gambling, but as I'm involved, gaming will be conducted with the utmost integrity," said Mr. Creighton.
As deputy director of the Iowa Gaming and Racing Commission, Mr. Creighton, who has a law degree from Drake University, worked with casino and riverboat gambling, as well as parimutuel betting on horses and dogs.
Having held jobs from prison corrections officer to high school teacher to bank officer before beginning a career in gambling regulation, Mr. Creighton, 39 years old, said his diverse background would come in handy: "It prepared me with a pretty eclectic view of how an administration operates."

THE ECONOMY

 
One Theory Says Andrew Will Help the Economy 

The first cost of Hurricane Andrew was a human one: at least 20 people killed, 30 injured and as many as 230,000 left homeless. And then there is the economy. Estimates are imprecise, but Andrew may have caused $30 billion in destruction. "The rule of thumb is that one-third of losses is insured," said Bob Bannon, a financial economist with I.D.E.A. Inc., a research and forecasting concern in New York. A further rule, Mr. Bannon said, is that when insured losses reach a certain point, insurance companies, banks and individuals are forced to liquidate assets. "We may see $8 billion to $10 billion worth of assets put up for sale, which could put severe downward pressure on the markets," he said. But when the sweep-up begins, the economy is expected to feel a little bounce. Housing is expected to pick up, and with it durable goods and government spending. "It could create a little boomlet," Mr. Bannon said.
 
The Job-Training Bandwagon
 
Last week, President Bush wandered into Clinton territory. Against the backdrop of the Lincoln Technical Institute in blue-collar Union, N.J., Mr. Bush proposed expanding Federal job-training programs by $10 billion over five years. (Gov. Bill Clinton made an expansion of training and apprenticeship programs a centerpiece of his platform.) But while Mr. Clinton said he would pay for his $3 billion-a-year program with a payroll tax of 1.5 percent to 2 percent on companies with more than 50 employees, Mr. Bush said he believed that "we can pay for this new job-training offensive without raising taxes on people or increasing overall Government spending." To do that, Mr. Bush said he would cut other domestic programs. Which ones? Mr. Bush did not say.

Stricter Diets
 
The Federal Government has been investigating the advertisements and claims of commercial diet centers for years. Battling the bulge is a $33 billion business. Last week, the five largest companies in that market -- Jenny Craig International, Nutrisystem, Physician's Weight Loss Center, Diet Center and Weight Watchers -- joined to petition the Federal Trade Commission to establish industrywide standards and regulations for advertising and claims. These companies, which offer weight-loss programs without medical supervision, said in their petition they want their competing businesses to operate under a uniform set of rules. But some people familiar with the industry are skeptical of the companies' motives. "This is a classic effort to stall the Federal process," said Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. "It's a strategy to evade hard-nosed settlements and evade providing a factual basis for their advertising claims."

'Dark Forces' in the Economy
For months, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, has been saying the economy is sailing into headwinds. More evidence came last week when the Commerce Department confirmed the earlier estimate that gross domestic product increased by just 1.4 percent in the second quarter, after growing by 2.9 percent the quarter before. But for Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company, the economic problems are more hurricane than headwind. "The forces of darkness are arrayed against the forces of light," he said. On the light side are low interest rates, low inflation and a low dollar -- which should spark growth. Opposing them are such forces as "the real estate depression, a weak world economy, the switch from a wartime economy to peace, and businesses trying to raise profits by keeping costs down." Together, Mr. Sinai said, these factors have created the "most aberrant business cycle in history."

Queasy Consumers

The first line of defense against recession is the consumer. Consumers account for two-thirds of all economic activity, but they spend freely only when they feel confident about the future. And lately, they have been feeling uneasy. The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence slipped to 58 in August from 61.2 in July. The index was an ebullient 100 in 1985. "The promise of business recovery, which was suggested by the markedly improved confidence readings recorded in the spring, has all but withered away," said Fabien Linden, director of the survey.

When the Publicity Is Free
 
Hollywood has never been known for its subtlety or sensitivity. So it was no surprise last week when Tri-Star Pictures said it would advance the release date of Woody Allen's new movie, "Husbands and Wives," and increase the number of cities where it would open. The movie -- about the relationship between an older man and younger woman -- stars Mr. Allen and Mia Farrow. Hollywood's marketing mavens think the publicity surrounding Mr. Allen's own troubled relationship with Ms. Farrow will help the film. "Because what's going on so closely mirrors the film," said Leonie de Picciotto, senior vice president of the Samuel Goldwyn Company, "there's going to be a lot of interest in seeing it."

D.E.C.'s Second Chance
 
Though it tried once before -- with poor results -- the Digital Equipment Corporation, the nation's No. 2 computer maker, said last week it would make another attempt to become a force in the world of personal computers. Digital said it would manufacture in Taiwan a low-priced line of computers called DECpc LP (for low profile), which would sell for as little as $899. Digital, which is big in mainframes and minicomputers, currently has just 1 percent of the PC market. But analysts are optimistic about its plans. "Right now, Digital isn't even a slice on the personal-computer pie chart," said Jack Karp, an analyst with the Meta Group in Westport, Conn. "With these systems, it ought to become an identifiable slice in the next 12 months."

Hard Times for Mentor
 
The latest victim of the slowdown in the computer industry is the Mentor Graphics Corporation, once a high-flying company. Mentor, which makes scientific work stations and writes software, said last week it would eliminate 100 to 200 jobs, freeze salaries and streamline its operations. The company will take a charge of $15 million to $25 million for the restructuring. Mentor posted a $5.66 million loss for the first half of 1992 on sales of $189.2 million.
 
Toward a New T.W.A.
 
The privately held Trans World Airlines took a major step toward reorganizing itself into an employee-owned airline last week when its creditors committee, the International Association of Machinists and the Air Line Pilots Association reached an agreement on wages similar to one previously worked out with the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants. The agreement, which still must be approved by the Federal Bankruptcy Court and the unions' membership, calls for a 15 percent wage reduction in exchange for a 45 percent equity stake in the newly reorganized airline. The reductions will save the airline $350 million a year.

Faraway Events Stall Saturn
 
The Saturn division is the General Motors Corporation's shining light. Its sales are sprinting, its quality is high and its dealers are rated among the best. But in the world of just-in-time inventory, Saturn's plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., had to shut down when a strike by members of the United Automobile Workers closed G.M.'s Lordstown, Ohio, metal fabrication plant. Workers at Lordstown are striking over job security, health and safety issues and a proposal to eliminate 240 jobs. Other plants could also be struck. Even though no cars are being built, Saturn employees are scheduled to show up for work tomorrow for training classes.
 
Continental, the Popular Airline
 
Last week, Air Canada and Air Partners L.P., bid $400 million for the bankrupt Continental Airlines, with $100 million in equity. It's beginning to look like a bidding war. A month ago, Charles E. Hurwitz, the Houston investor, bid $350 million for Continental with $25 million in equity. And earlier this month, Alfredo Brener, a Houston investor whose family owns a major stake in Mexicana Airlines, bid $385 million for Continental.

The Dollar's Bleak Future
 
After being buffeted for weeks and falling to a 47-year low against the German mark, the dollar finally regained a little of its composure, settling at 1.4105 marks on Friday. But with German short-term interest rates hovering at 9.8 percent and American short term rates at 3.25 percent, traders do not expect the dollar to regain its ground anytime soon. "We aren't going to see an end to this pressure until the Bundesbank gives some indication of when it's going to lower interest rates," said Alan Chase, senior trader at National Westminster Bank in London
 
Yeltsin's Spirit of Cooperation
 
When he first asked for aid, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia reluctantly agreed to the conditions of the International Monetary Fund. But with $24 billion in Western aid held up pending a formal agreement between Russia and the I.M.F., Mr. Yeltsin's Government has turned enthusiastic. Moscow now agrees to trim spending to less than 5 percent of gross domestic product and to keep monthly inflation in the single digits, as the I.M.F. requested. Russia and the I.M.F., are working out a slew of economic targets, including those relating to the ruble exchange rate. The I.M.F. said it was pleased with the progress -- a prelude to freeing the aid.
 
Economic Tonic in Tokyo
 
To rouse its slumbering economy from recession and add a little life to its stock market, the Japanese Government announced a new emergency spending package worth $86.3 billion. The package includes money for public works, for bailing out ailing banks and for investing in the stock market. The Nikkei 225 stock index rose 2.37 percent on the news.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
A Fast Way to Discover Patterns in Vast Amounts of Data

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
In their quest for an edge in the financial markets, a number of traders have turned to a computer system called the Market Information Machine, created by Logical Information Machines Inc. of Austin, Tex.
MIM, as its fans call it, combines a powerful desktop computer with an extremely fast method of searching data bases to sort through current and historical market data, looking for patterns or correlations. Once a pattern is discovered, it can be used to increase the chances of making a profitable trade -- in theory, at least. 
 "It's one of those things that you might not use for several days, and then something comes up and you say, 'Hey, what's the answer?' " said Frank J. Marinaro, vice president of research for the Gelber Group of Chicago, a bond trading office and commodity trading adviser. "Like yesterday, the bond market was down a full point. So we ask, 'Show me the bond market the week before and the week after, when bonds are down a point on the day.' That's a simple request. We can tack on other conditions, like, 'and when X happens.' " X might be a sudden rise in foreign currency movements, or a shift in a particular company's stock price.
Jeffrey Li, vice president of the Duich Investment Corporation of San Francisco and another MIM enthusiast, said: "If you look at correlation of interest rate levels versus the price of stocks, you know that as interest rates go lower the market is going to go up. But everybody knows that and will be on that trade." So the hard part, he said, is coming up with original ideas. "Usually it's been done before, and it's hard to make money when everyone is doing the same thing," he said.
Using MIM, traders can concoct ad hoc queries with multiple variables. For example:
* When the Consumer Price Index was up less than 5 percentage points over a 12-month period, and the price-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500 index was 10 or less, was the S.&P. up in the following 12 months? If so, by how much?
* Show United States bond prices from, say, the first hour of trading to 1 P.M. on days when a share of International Business Machines is down more than 10.
* The last time bond prices were up 1 percent and so was the German mark against the dollar, what happened in the bond and currency markets in the next three days?
MIM has a relatively easy-to-use method that allows traders to create such questions using point-and-click commands, or by typing the questions in plain English. In other data base systems, queries are usually constructed in a programming language. Few traders have the time to learn to be programmers, or to wait for staff programmers to prepare and process the request.
Anthony D. Kolton, president of Logical Information Machines and, by no coincidence, a former stock and commodity trader in Chicago, said he thought MIM would eventually prove itself in many uses outside the financial markets.
"Our technology will apply wherever there are vast quantities of data, and you want to ask complex questions," he said. Insurance companies might want to use the system for risk analysis, for example. "We're currently in the design phase to analyze consumer scanner data at grocery stores," Mr. Kolton said. Supermarkets generate thousands of megabytes of data, in areas ranging from inventory control and special pricing to sales at the checkout counter, but as with the stock market there is no convenient way to ask complex questions of it.
As he explained it, a manager might ask MIM: "Show me the sales of this certain product in this region when it's on sale on Saturday between 9 A.M. and noon, when the competitor is not running a coupon and when it's displayed on an endcap," the prime display area at the ends of aisles. "The way it is now, if you want the knowledge you have to do custom programming. Using this system, you can get quality research a lot quicker."
The great strength of the MIM seems to be its speed, which derives in part from the proprietary way the system takes advantage of a computer's high-speed memory, said Eugene Lowenthal, a former director of the advanced computer architecture program at the Microelectronics and Computer Corporation of Austin and now a director of Logical Information Machines. MIM traces its origins to research done at the corporation.
In the financial markets particularly, all the data needed for research are generally publicly available, but few traders have the luxury of enough time to spend researching data, poring over charts and reading reams of analysis. And often they are not willing to commit the time or money needed to have a researcher check out a convoluted hunch -- especially if the hunch requires going back through 70 years of stock market data and economic indicators.
Mr. Li of Duich Investment said he was impressed with how quickly MIM can sift through years of data and display the results as graphs. His system is loaded with about 1,500 megabytes of market data -- about 1.5 billion characters. "It retrieves data almost instantaneously," Mr. Li said. And, of course, "as traders, we really, really like speed," he said.
Duich Investment leases the MIM software, which includes the data base search engine and the historic market data, and runs it on a Unix work station. The software costs the company about $2,500 a month, depending on options.
Logical Information Machines said more than two dozen companies, including some of the biggest names on Wall Street, use its system. Financial and insurance companies are notoriously secretive about the equipment and technologies they use in competitive forecasting, and several companies declined to acknowledge that they use MIM. Those that did praised MIM despite its expense.
"One of our traders said it paid for itself after the first trade we did on it, and that was for the full year, hardware and software," said Mr. Marinaro of the Gelber Group.
Clearly, MIM is not for the casual investor, although no doubt some individuals would like to have instant access to decades of market data.
Because it is a one-stop shop, combining market data and the search engine, MIM may prove to be a model for future tools for the investor, once prices come down, as they inevitably have in the computer business.
Many traders have turned to powerful computers to take over the research chores. "Speed and accuracy are two of the most important criteria that money managers and traders would look for in any system," said Sharon S. Schwartzman, editor of Wall Street and Technology magazine.
One Wall Street trader for a large firm who spoke only on condition that neither his name nor that of his company be used said he had seen an early version of MIM and rejected it.
"It was clunky and difficult to use, it didn't have enough functions, and there was no ability to hook up our own data," he recalled. His company decided to develop its own computer-based system, he said. But recently, he added, he had seen the "very impressive" latest version of MIM -- and leased it.
"For the medium-sized shop, it's a must," he said. "We're a larger house, and we have got to have this stuff."

HEADLINE: Networking;
Bringing Laptops Into the Fold

BYLINE: By STEPHEN C. MILLER

 BODY:
People who travel with portable computers are sometimes called road warriors. Like the Mad Max character, they feel alone and surrounded by hostiles. Airport security won't let them on the plane until they can turn on the computer to show it's not an explosive, but the battery just died and no spare is available. The hotel telephone is wired so a modem can't be used. The disk containing that spiffy electronic slide show is damaged and the only copy sits several thousand miles away on the network file server.
While the road warriors are not physically connected to the network, more and more of them are demanding service as if they were. A sales rep who missed a $3 million sale because she couldn't get approval in time from her manager is not mollified by a network manager's explanations about the need for a node address, routing difficulties over a wide area network and the high cost of 56-kilobit data lines. Nor is she interested in a detailed explanation of why she couldn't E-mail the proposed contract changes from the customer's site, the way she would have in the office. 
 Network administrators and their managers who are not planning for the needs of the mobile computer user will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. The trends are clearly established.
Current portables, weighing less than six pounds, can duplicate most of the power and functions of deskbound machines. Prices, which once were double those of desktop machines, are dropping to a point where they are no longer a significant issue. Sales of portables are increasing at a faster rate than those of desktops.
Manufacturers of portable computers have recognized changes in the needs of the mobile user. Zenith Data Systems, for example, makes a line of laptops with built-in network interface cards that will plug into the network from a branch office wired to the network. The traveling user would instantly be connected to all the usual network services, like E-mail. Other manufacturers have announced similar options.
William Bluestein, senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., sees a wider implication for network managers in these "visitor work stations." "You're going to have a lot of people who don't work for your company connecting to the network with a laptop," he said.
Those "casual" users would include important customers, auditors and others who would provide services requiring some network access. It also raises the nagging question of network security.

HEADLINE: The Mall That Ate Minnesota

BYLINE: By NEAL KARLEN

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Minn., Aug. 25

 BODY:
Victor Gruen has been all but lost to history, his name ridiculed when it is remembered. As the designer of Southdale, the world's first fully enclosed shopping mall, Mr. Gruen languishes in the rogues' gallery reserved for those pioneers of plastic consumerism who gave America everything from aerosol cheese to Astroturf.
Yet, Mr. Gruen was thinking more of civics than shopping when he opened Southdale in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina in 1956. To Mr. Gruen, the mall was to have been America's new Main Street, a town common to bring together citizens increasingly displaced from each other by the burgeoning postwar sprawl of freeways and suburbs. 
 This new town square was to have churches and hospitals. One day, he had hoped, the mall would serve as an all-purpose, cross-cultural destination for the new global village.
He was wrong. And today, civic pride being what it is, visitors to the Twin Cities are not taken to see Victor Gruen's still-standing landmark, but to the coffeehouse where Bobby Zimmerman alchemized into Bob Dylan, the purple house where Prince once pranced and the boardinghouse where F. Scott Fitzgerald pounded out "This Side of Paradise."
Then, this month, the Twin Cities were struck with Victor Gruen's Revenge. "Now," said Emily Goldberg, a local film maker, "people visiting me get off the plane and demand to go right to the megamall. The megamall? This is what we're going to be remembered for?"
Perhaps. For this $650 million fully enclosed shopping center is not only the most grandiose mall in American history. Nor is the complex, known officially as the Mall of America, just a pumped-up Paramus-on-the-Prairie, one more cookie-cutter amalgam of stores, frozen-yogurt stands and packs of free-range adolescents in Guess jeans.
It is also a 78-acre full-sensory smorgasbord of consumerism whose indoor vistas, its builders hope, will redeem Mr. Gruen's misbegotten dream. As such, its consortium of developers projects that the megamall, as it is known colloquially, will draw more customers a year by 1996 than Walt Disney World or the Grand Canyon.
Perhaps. Many industry analysts, however, question the sanity of launching a monster mall in the middle of a recession, at a time when studies suggest that Americans would rather do almost anything with their leisure time other than shop.
According to surveys conducted by Chicago's M.A.S. Marketing, the time spent monthly in malls by the average shopper dropped from 12 hours in 1980 to four hours in 1990. And sales per square foot of retail space in malls nationwide have dropped 17 percent since the peak year of 1978, according to studies by Management Horizons of Chicago.
STILL, as they say in Minnesota, the bait seems fresh. Inside the mall, its 4.2 million square feet have been diced into almost 400 specialty stores anchored by huge renditions of rare-to-the-Midwest delicacies like Bloomingdales, Nordstrom and Macy's. Sears, Roebuck fills the last of the corner anchors of the megamall, which, when everything is counted, takes up the equivalent of 88 football fields' worth of space on four floors. Only 41 of those fields are used for retailing; still, it takes almost an hour to briskly cruise the mall, with no timeouts for shopping.
At first sight, the megamall's sheer footage is so intimidating that some local grumps now refer to the shopping center as "megadeath." Yet, vast sums have been spent here to reduce the number of consumers stricken with shopping-mall anomie.
To beat back claustrophobia, the mall's innards have been remade wherever possible to make shoppers feel as if they were outside. The most notable of these efforts is the mall's seven-acre Camp Snoopy. It sits in a central courtyard and rises from ground level to the fourth floor, stocked with 400 trees, 30,000 plants, a mountain and a four-story waterfall.
Upstairs, around the height of the highest peak on Camp Snoopy's roller coaster, are dozens of restaurants, both fast and fancy, as well as an assortment of nightclubs and a 14-screen movie house. When visitors depart, they exit what may be the world's largest parking structure, containing 13,000 free spaces within 300 feet of the mall.
Can it possibly work? "They'll come," said Michael Dorsey, a mall spokesman. "They're coming."
In the years since the first shopping mall, it became clear that Mr. Gruen's new Main Street was not that far removed from the old one in the days of Sinclair Lewis. In Lewis's novel "Main Street," the heroine finds that on her town's central drag: "It was not only the uninspiring, unapologetic ugliness and the rigid straightness which overwhelmed her. It was the planlessness, the flimsy temporariness of the buildings."
Today, this description of downtown Gopher Prairie sounds frighteningly like the blueprint for the malls that America grew up on, where drive-in shoppers browsed in charmless boxes to the accompaniment of Muzak.
Still, mall business remained solid through the 70's. The industry peaked in 1978, when sales per square foot of retail space averaged $197 a year, according to Management Horizons. Then came the downturn, as consumers, experts said, turned off to the shopping monoliths that in time seemed as soulless and over-baroque as a Las Vegas casino. Today, that yield is $163 a square foot.
The fall cannot be attributed solely to the recession. Over the last 10 years, shopping habits have changed. The days of aimless browsing through malls may have passed, as huge department stores are increasingly replaced by one-stop Wal-Mart-like discount chains and mini strip malls. People are increasingly shopping by television and catalogue but, studies show, rarely for pleasure.
And that, said the developers, is where they come in. Looking back to the long-lost vision of Mr. Gruen, they have tried to create a space that can make the megamall a destination, an idealized community, fun.
T HE easy part of that job is simple mall science, knowing, for example, to allow 4.5 parking spaces for every 1,000 square feet of leasable area inside. The hard part is selling the fantasy.
That fantasy is best expressed in the mall's theme song, written by Robin Batteau, New York's famed "Tarzan of the Jingle," whose resume includes lines like Chevrolet's "The heartbeat of America" and Coca-Cola's "Can't beat the feeling." For the mall, he came up with a wickedly memorable hook line played under the words: "There's a place for fun in your life, the Mall of America. You've got to see it to believe it. Who told you you can't have it all?"
To make that magic, the developers had to configure the mall's foreboding caverns to seem somehow inviting. So the complex was chopped into four winding corridors, each with a different theme. Matching their mood to a corridor, shoppers can start, say, in the gazebo- and wooden trellis-lined North Garden, the hallway billed as Main Street U.S.A.
The mix is critical. Because the megamall needs to appeal to the largest cross section of the population, its planners have planted the place with bonbons for every demographic. For each Abercrombie & Fitch, there seems to be a counterbalancing Filene's Basement.
Even shopping music has been democratized. Enlisting 3M, Muzak's arch-competitor, the mall has opted away from elevator music in favor of less somnolent stylings. Light FM, a radio service heavily inflected with Billy Joel and James Taylor, is piped into the mall's common areas, while current rock hits are heard in stores catering to 12- to 25-year-olds.
More than a million people huffed through the mall in the first week after Ray Charles was paid $50,000 to sing "America" during a grand-opening gala on Aug. 10. Other stars also came out. Larry Gatlin, who with his singing brothers owns a country-music show bar in the mall, was so moved by the spectacle that he could not stop repeating his mantra for business success: "Let's move some meatloaf!" he said to all who would listen.
Then there was pizza-pushing Wolfgang Puck, who went to the Mall of America to open his first restaurant outside California. The chef was chastised by an unimpressed woman from suburban Minneapolis who liked the food but was upset that Mr. Puck was eating as he served. "I don't care who he is," she said. "It's gross!"
As the bodies ebbed, flowed and banged up against each other during opening week, shopping proved a near-hallucinatory experience. From the epicenter near Camp Snoopy, it felt like an ecstatic mall rave, the staccato ka-ching of thousands of cash registers serving as the high-frequency techno-beat for hundreds of thousands of Midwest shoppers.
The mood over the megamall was not always so jovial. Ever since plans were first announced in 1985, developers have had to bull past vehement local naysayers. To bolster their case, the builders utilized an inspirational strategy of if-we-build-it-they-will-come. But the mall's first development script appeared to have been taken not from "Field of Dreams" but "The Music Man," with Nader Ghermezian, an Iranian rug merchant turned mall developer, playing Prof. Harold Hill, the silvery-tongued out-of-towner with a bright idea for civic improvement.
"You will have all the shoppers from New York, Rome, Los Angeles and Paris coming here," Mr. Ghermezian told Minnesota doubters at a 1986 news conference. "I bring you the moon and you don't want it?"
Maybe, said Minneapolis civic leaders as they pondered the models, then hauled up to Canada to see what Mr. Ghermezian and his three brothers, doing business as the Triple Five Corporation, had already done. What they found was the $1.1 billion West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, with 5.2 million square feet, still the world's biggest. Nader Ghermezian called his Canadian creation, which opened in 1981, "the Eighth Wonder of the World" -- and Minnesota decided it wanted the ninth.
Land was acquired in 1985 10 miles from Minneapolis in suburban Bloomington, on a site formerly occupied by Metropolitan Stadium, the demolished, much-beloved home of the Minnesota Twins. The Ghermezians originally planned on a mall even bigger than Canada's, but faced with some opposition and with having to refinance the project, they lured the Indianapolis-based mall kings Melvin and Herbert Simon to join the project in 1987, and the plans were scaled back.
On Aug. 11, the doors finally opened. And they came, in hordes nearing 150,000, to see what the developers said was the largest number of retailers ever to open on one day in one place. The Simon brothers, who own shares in the mall with the Ghermezians and several other silent partners, predict that by 1996 the Mall of America will draw 40 million customers a year, a third of them from more than 150 miles away.
BUT the doubters remain unmoved. For in the years since Mr. Ghermezian first pulled into Minneapolis, American shopping habits have changed.
"I hate to say this, but I think it is doomed to fail," said Therese Byrne, a Salomon Brothers real estate analyst. "I think everyone is shocked that the mall's backers actually went through with this. But I guess you can't back off when you're half-pregnant."
What the developers hope they are on to is the good-willed frenzy that seemed to vibrate through the floors of the megamall during its opening week. Those mobs -- as seen from above in a Camp Snoopy roller-coaster car on a weekday afternoon -- seemed as happy, brisk and surreally well choreographed as the June Taylor dancers.
Down below, however, is a suggestion that the mall may be cursed by the ghost of the major-league ball park that used to sit there. Metropolitan Stadium looms in the Midwest imagination the way Ebbets Field is recalled in Brooklyn, and Camp Snoopy sits directly above where home plate used to be.
"Metropolitan Stadium was one of the most pastoral ball parks ever," said Art Simon, a Minnesota native who teaches film theory at New York University and who not related to the Simons. "To pave that paradise is like building on an Indian burial ground: you tempt the gods."
But mall spokesmen seem unworried by the threat of old ball-park voodoo. To other doomsayers, the Mall of America need only point to its opening figures. In the first week of business, during those scarce gorgeous Minnesota summer days, more than a million people, it is estimated, went inside the mall, and 13,000 pounds of chicken were consumed at Camp Snoopy. At BareBones, a medical-supply store, 20,000 purchases were made, 432 screaming fly swatters were sold, and the line of people waiting to go inside often numbered 200. Only three cars were stolen from the parking area, and nobody died anywhere in the megamall.
And what if it all goes bust, if fancy stores go vacant and little stores unbrowsed? Then, experts in shopping-mall sociology say, the mix of tenants will get even wilder. A church, a car dealership, a casino or a hospital might move in, perhaps finally validating in failure Victor Gruen's prophesy of the shopping mall as America's new Main Street.
But right now there will be no talk of that at America's most grandiose shopping center. "The people will come," said Mr. Dorsey, the mall spokesman, repeating his own mantra: "They're coming."

HEADLINE: The Lace Is in the Gloves

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
"RIGHT!" barks Tony Canarozzi.
Kristen Connolly, a 25-year-old researcher for the Wall Street firm Tudor Investments giggles and pushes her right arm toward her 24-year-old colleague, Stacy Beecher. Ms. Connolly grins impishly, like a little girl on a playground trying to see just how far she can go. Her punch is tentative, soft, halting. 
 "Jab! Jab!" Mr. Canarozzi yells.
Ms. Connolly exhales into two quick left jabs. She purses her lips and breathes faster.
It's 6:45 P.M. at the Institute for Fitness, a tiny private gym at 76 Beaver Street in the Wall Street area where Mr. Canarozzi is the boxing coach. Four other pairs of professional women have also traded success-dress for cotton shorts and T-shirts. Their hands have been wrapped in strips of protective cotton, their flawless manicures tucked into red Everlast boxing gloves. They're suited up for the latest rage on the fitness frontier: aerobic boxing.
Since the mid-1980's, when Ivy League-educated Wall Streeters started sliding into sweaty gyms to punch bags, jump rope and, eventually, face off in rings, A. J. Leibling's "sweet science" has been popping up more and more in the popular consciousness. There was Mickey Rourke, then "Diggstown." Last month, Allure magazine pictured the actress and model Carre Otis sparring in a gym. Dan Golomb, chairman of the Everlast Sports Manufacturing Company, noticed a sudden surge in the sale of small-size boxer shorts. ("The ones the women typically buy," he said.) Aerobics studios across the nation began offering boxing classes.
"Our clients wanted more than aerobic dance," said Nicole Chevance, the manager of the Jeff Martin Studio on the Upper West Side. "The response to the first classes this summer was amazing. And it was all women."
A typical boxing workout begins with 15 minutes on the Stairmaster, followed by five 3-minute rounds of fast-paced jump rope. Next comes 10 minutes of punching, first a heavy bag, and then a smaller speed bag, followed by 15 minutes of drills in steps, ducks and punches. After that, the would-be boxer faces a partner holding "focus pads" -- cushions meant to absorb punches with 1,000-pound force -- and practices punching in 10 3-minute rounds. A hundred sit-ups and a 3-minute round of fast-paced shadow boxing end the session.
Lilly Rivera, a personal trainer at the private gym of a Wall Street investment firm who began boxing two months ago, estimates that the workout burns 600 to 800 calories, more than most aerobics classes that last as long, and offers better-rounded training. In addition to upper- and lower-body development, she said, boxing teaches coordination, quick reflexes and agility.
The fascination of pugilism for women is already moving beyond the tidy, mirrored confines of aerobics studios. Women are beginning to enter the ring at Gleason's Gym, the Brooklyn boxing center where professionals train.
"There's been a tremendous increase in women, mostly the lawyer and M.B.A. types," said Ira Becker, an owner of the gym. "But we trained Twyla Tharp and more actresses than I can name.
"Initially, they see the value in terms of fitness, but eventually it goes deeper. Eventually they want to spar."
When the first punches connect with the body of another, they make a thunk: a particular, determined, relentless sound; a scary sound that Norman Mailer once described as "a heavy ax in the distance chopping into a wet log." For women learning to box, the ax-into-wet-log sound is just as shocking as that of Ibsen's Nora slamming the door. The sound of a woman landing a punch is the sound of a shattered taboo.
Mr. Canarozzi, a former middleweight who trains women at the Institute for Fitness as well as at Gleason's, protects his prodigies from the shock of the sound. After the first 30 minutes of his workouts, hearts are racing, endorphins surging. The women are sweat-drenched, breathless -- Stepford wives to the sound of his voice. He barks orders for every exercise, every drill, assuming all responsibility for the initiation of violence and removing it from the conscience of his pupils.
"Duck to the right! Duck to the left! Jab, jab! Right! Duck to the right! Duck to the left! Left hook! Right! Right!"
Ms. Connolly's impish grin tightens. She bends, sways and slams into the focus pads that Ms. Beecher is holding. Each punch comes with the kind of gasping grunt that Gestalt therapists dream of. Her teeth are bared. She punches again and again. She punches until Mr. Canarozzi yells, "Stop!"
Immediately, as if awakened from a hypnotic trance, she stops. She giggles. She swings her Breck girl ponytail and stares at her boxing gloves.
"Gee," she says.
Later, Ms. Connolly called boxing a stress reliever. "You're concentrating so much that nothing else matters," she said. "Afterwards, I feel totally clear and calm."
Other women who have entered the ring agree.
"It takes intense concentration and precision, a combination of physical and psychic energy," said Wendy G. Finch, the 33-year-old director of sales for Chanel Fragrances Exclusive in Manhattan, who boxes three times a week at Gleason's. "When I leave here, I am clear, self-confident and peaceful."
THE cultural shadow boxing that draws women into the ring is as arresting as the social underpinnings of any great fight. Dempsey versus Tunney, wrote Elliot J. Gorman, was basically a contest between brutal, lower-class frontierism (Dempsey) and clean-cut Victorianism (Tunney). Women who box symbolize an affluent economy, the blurring of sexual distinctions, a continuing power struggle and, perhaps as much as anything else, a need for utility and precision.
In her 1987 essay "On Boxing," Joyce Carol Oates wrote that since gladiatorial times in Rome, the fascination with boxing has been at its highest in the wealthier, more advanced societies. In the decadent era of Nero, women boxed publicly. In the essay, Ms. Oates wondered whether an effete and indulgent prosperity didn't engender a need for "the outward signs and gestures of 'savagery.' "
Watching women, I kept seeing the same smile. It appeared after the aerobics, after the punching, when the women got inside the coach's focus pads and ran, flailing, into his chest. Mr. Canarozzi conceded that all the several dozen women he trains "have a lot of anger toward men."
But the smile I saw repeatedly wasn't that of the victim; it was the smile of the reassured.
"How often do you come up against a real guy like this anymore?" asked Teri Giorgi, a hair stylist who had just "boxed into" Mr. Canarozzi, getting inside the pads to his chest.
The exercise seemed to solidify the shift in distinctions between the sexes. "Some of the guys I work with can't believe I go to boxing classes," said Judy Salvatore, an administrative manager on a securities trading desk who boxed with bangles of drop pearl earrings from both lobes. "I say, it's 1992. Wake up. If some weirdo comes after me on the subway, I'll deck him. It's 1992. I can take care of myself."
Y OU think differently about yourself after three lessons. Like most women who have taken to the sport, I was overeducated, overexercised and underinterested in punching anybody out. But as soon as I walked into a gym that reeked of human effort and faced Mr. Canarozzi, a barrel-chested old-time coach in a sweatshirt with a whistle around his neck, some kind of invisible gauntlet seemed to have been thrown down. I felt voyeuristic, inside some male citadel and bound to prove that I belonged.
Aerobic boxing made my daily hour on the Stairmaster seem like a walk in the park. By the time the coach tied on my gloves, I was in an altered state of consciousness: "the zone," athletes call it.
The coach ordered punches, and I knew what an attack dog feels like when its owner says, "Sic!" I felt safer than I've felt in years when I boxed into Mr. Canarozzi's chest and he wrapped his bear arms around me in a boxer's embrace.
"O.K., fighter," he said to me. To an assistant he said, "Take her gloves." He told me later that I'd fought like an animal and he didn't want me to hurt anybody. I don't remember that part.
I remember the focus and feeling of purpose in the exercise. After 10 years of aimless aerobics, motion with a mission was a relief. I lost three pounds during each workout, as opposed to the pound and a half I normally lose working out. My shoulders, trapezoids, lateral chest muscles, thighs and calves ached afterward.
I was euphoric after my lessons with Mr. Canarozzi. There was also a nameless sort of longing that I couldn't define until I dropped by Gleason's one night last week. A group of women I'd watched Mr. Canarozzi train on Wall Street had gone there for the first time to train. All professed a deep distaste for violence and had no aspiration, they said, for an appearance in the ring.
But inside the fetid sweat- and bloodstained world of Gleason's, punching bags alongside welterweight and middleweight contenders, all kept looking toward the four rings in the center of the gym. They moved closer to the rings. They touched its canvas mat, tested its ropes. The bell rang every three minutes.
Punches thunked soggily and steadily. Each of the six women who'd been studying aerobic boxing "for the exercise" narrowed their eyes over their raised gloves and focused on the ring.
Mr. Becker, the owner, studied the women and smiled.
"Male or female," he said, "it doesn't matter. They learn the craft, and eventually they're going to say, 'Let's box.' It's inevitable."

HEADLINE: How to Repel Immigrants' Threat

 BODY:
The generally supportive and approving tones describing the local front in the third-world invasion of the United States ["Hispanic Influx Being Felt on East End," July 12] is reprehensible. With the left-wing political culture doing everything it can to discourage assimilation, promote bilingualism and cheapen the value of American citizenship, no one on Long Island or in the nation can afford to be apathetic, let alone passively supportive, of the breakdown of national soverignty which characterizes United States immigration policy.
In an age of increasing technological sophistication, the United States can not afford to continually accept massive immigration by slash-and-burn third-world peasants. The overload of non-Western immigrants threatens the cultural and political traditions which created this republic and made it the envy of the world. 
 The dangers posed by growing communities of illegal immigrants was graphically exposed by the fact that one-third of the rioters in South-Central Los Angeles were illegal aliens, and the Washington Heights riots were orchestrated by drug gangs manned primarily by illegal aliens. The argument that these people are needed is contradicted by good evidence that over the last 20 years immigrants, especially from Latin America, extract more wealth in social services than they create in labor. With unemployment as high as it is among blacks, college and high-school students, it is doubtful that these people are as necessary as some businesspeople contend -- though no doubt they may be cheaper.
The failure of the Suffolk County government to take steps to aid in repelling this invasion of our nation is more than disconcerting. It is despicable. For a Town Councilman to state that "we have no choice but to welcome them" is an admission of governmental and moral bankruptcy. You don't welcome people who have violated our law and threaten our national cohesion and institutions. The correct response for governmental leaders, and indeed all citizens, is to inform the I.N.S. whenever these people are identified, so they may receive the only benefit they have any claim to -- a fast return trip to their country of origin.

HEADLINE: 'How Stupid Do They Think We Are?'

BYLINE: By Ross Perot; Ross Perot is author of "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country."

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
The other day, a plumber stopped me and said, "Ross, there's not a nickel's worth of difference between the two political parties." A construction worker told me, "If I hear one more phony speech about 'family values,' I think I'll throw up!" The most frequently repeated statement by good, hard-working people since the Democratic and Republican conventions has been: "How stupid do they think we are?"
Both parties act as if they bear no responsibility for the $4 trillion debt that burdens our country. But the world financial markets tell the story, as the dollar dropped to new lows against the German mark after the Republican convention. A computer engineer summed it up: "We can't be a superpower unless we are first an economic superpower -- just look at Russia." 
 Sam Walton became America's richest man by standing in the aisles, listening to his customers and taking swift action to meet their needs and desires.
Unfortunately, the parties have lost touch with the American people. Neither party has a Sam Walton. They spend so much time listening to the special interests -- from the foreign lobbyists to the tobacco industry -- that give them the huge amounts of money needed for their campaigns that they can't hear taxpaying citizens.
An interesting thing happened this year. Five and a half million people, who feel they have no voice in the country they own, joined together in a petition signing process to put me on the ballot.
Even after I announced that we could best solve the country's problems if one or both of the political parties would squarely face the issues and deal with them, the people continued getting petitions signed and have now formed a national organization, United We Stand America. The process has been completed in 48 states and should be successfully completed in all 50. Their goal is to influence every Congressional race, as well as the Presidential race, and they are active in every state. At their request, I am actively supporting them.
I am not the centerpiece of this effort. My role as a candidate is incidental. This effort is focused on rebuilding our country. Only the owners -- the people -- can do it.
Earlier this year, the Republicans and Democrats spent several months arrogantly wandering around asking, "Who are these people getting petitions signed?"
I can tell you exactly who these people are. These are people who love their country, work hard, rear good children, play by the rules, love the principles on which this country was founded -- and don't like to see those principles violated. They are disgusted with gridlock government, finger-pointing, check bouncing and neglect of domestic and economic issues. They are concerned about their jobs and their children's futures, as we export entire industries, deindustrializing America and putting our people out of work.
Why should Democrats and Republicans in every political race listen to these people? Here is one good reason: their numbers are so large that they can be the swing vote that determines who wins Congress and the White House in November.
Just to eliminate any confusion by the candidates and political parties about what the people who make up United We Stand America are concerned about -- here is a partial list. I hope the parties will treat it as a wake-up call.
* Rebuild the job base and put our people back to work.
* Stimulate the growth of small businesses by making capital and credit available. Today they are starved for both. Credit can be made available by changing the banking regulations. Capital can be made available by eliminating all capital gains taxes for money that goes directly into the treasuries of small businesses.
* Develop an intelligent, supportive relationship between Government and business.
* Develop strategic plans on an industry-by-industry basis to strengthen and rebuild our large companies. Target the industries of the future and develop specific plans to be the world leader in those industries. Our successful international competitors do this. We don't.
* Build and maintain our manufacturing base. We cannot be a superpower unless we are a world leader in manufacturing. Never forget that if we have to defend our country we will need to be able to make a range of products, from steel and integrated circuits to shoes (remember Valley Forge?), and convert our factories to wartime use.
* Eliminate the deficit. Pass necessary legislation to balance the budget. Put in place a program to pay off the national debt. The President's check-off box is a gimmick. It won't begin to pay for just one year's interest on the debt.
* Get rid of illegal drugs and dramatically reduce crime and violence throughout our country. Talk won't do it.
* Rebuild our cities. Make our "alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears."
* Make our public schools the finest in the world. Today, they rank at the bottom of the industrialized world.
* Restructure our health-care system to make it cost effective. Today, it is the most expensive in the industrialized world, but not the best. Minor changes suggested by both parties won't fix the problem.
* Develop a new tax system that is fair, paperless for most Americans and raises the money necessary to pay our country's bills. The parties don't even talk about this.
* Make it a criminal offense for foreign countries, foreign companies or foreign individuals to hire lobbyists or contribute money -- or services -- to political campaigns. Both parties have foreign lobbyists in key campaign roles.
* Pass laws prohibiting cashing in on prior Government service.
* Develop truly fair free-trade agreements. Today we are giving entire industries to other countries.
* Develop an intelligent energy policy. We have no policy. Our country is totally vulnerable in case of war.
* Give the President a line-item veto.
* Pass laws to stop Congress from exempting itself from laws it imposes on the rest of the country.
* Bring the overly generous Congressional retirement plan in line with private-sector plans and get rid of unnecessary perks in Government. Slash staffs in the executive and legislative branches.
* Pass laws requiring the return of all excess political campaign funds to the Treasury.
* Pass laws to reduce the time required for Federal election campaigns, reduce the cost of Federal campaigns and create equal opportunity for all new candidates by providing equal television time.
* Replace the Electoral College with the popular vote.
* Eliminate political action committees and pass laws eliminating all possibilities for special interests to give large sums of money to candidates.
* Hold elections on Saturday and Sunday, instead of Tuesday. Make it easy for working people to vote. Prohibit the release of election information until the polls close in Hawaii.
* Finally, and most importantly, bring us together. United teams win. Divided teams lose. Play to our multicultural strengths. Stop preaching the messages of hate and division in your campaign themes.
And now, a message to both parties. Please remember that those who have participated in the United We Stand America movement are intelligent, thinking, responsible people.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Show of Force on Iraq Signals New Direction

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
The creation of a "no-fly zone" over southern Iraq by the United States and its allies last week was ostensibly aimed at preventing President Saddam Hussein from continuing to terrorize and slaughter the region's large, dissident Shiite Muslim population in the name of quelling its persistent, if ineffectual insurgency. But it also signaled the start of a reversal of Administration policy toward Iraq, which has failed in its implicit goal of ousting Mr. Hussein.
After 18 months of studiously ignoring, first, Mr. Hussein's brutal crushing of the March 1991 Shiite uprising after the Persian Gulf war and more recently, Iraq's repression of the southern Shiites, the Bush Administration is sending condolences to the victims. 
 Though the new policy, in which President Bush demanded that Iraq halt all flights over the 47,500 square miles of southern Iraq, was praised by many analysts and quickly endorsed by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, its timing prompted questions about political motivation, a suggestion that Mr. Bush and his team heatedly denied last week. Nevertheless, said the Middle East expert Fouad Ajami, who supports the thrust of the new policy, the Administration's "election-eve conversion" made such suspicions unavoidable.
Clearly there are new circumstances. Mr. Hussein only began using fixed-wing aircraft in raids against the Shiites in April. A United Nations report detailing Iraq's human rights abuses of the Shiites was presented only on Aug. 11. And only in recent months has Iraq increased harassment of United Nations inspectors, human rights monitors and relief workers.
Moreover, officials note, the Western and Arab coalition authorized by the United Nations to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait lacked a specific mandate to protect Iraqi minorities until April 1991, when Mr. Hussein's savage repression of the Iraqi Kurds prompted the Security Council to approve Resolution 688. By then the Shiite uprising in the south had already been put down.
Finally, they say, the Administration needed time to mobilize logistical support for a joint response, and above all, time to determine that such action would not jeopardize the Arab-Israeli peace talks under way in Washington. Those talks are widely seen as the most impressive byproduct of the gulf confrontation. Yitzhak Rabin's election victory over the intransigent Likud Government insured that the talks would progress, as, indeed, they have.
 
Fears of Dismemberment
 Only a year ago, the White House accepted Arab warnings that the creation of a no-fly zone would lead to the effective partition of Iraq, a prospect anathema to Sunni Arabs, the Shiites' bitter historical rivals, and who have traditionally relied on Iraq to counter militantly Shiite Iran. The dismemberment of Iraq, in turn, could lead either to the creation of a Shiite Islamic enclave in southern Iraq, or even worse, they feared, to Iranian influence or domination there. For far too long, officials now acknowledge, they believed that Mr. Hussein would be ousted by the Sunni military men who surround him.
Critics, like Laurie Mylroie, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, argued futilely that the Iraqi Shiites were nationalists, and that they probably lacked the political cohesion needed to form a separate state. The Iraqi opposition, even those based in Iran, were committed to keeping Iraq intact.
But fear of Islamic fundamentalism and of Iran led to inaction. United States officials calculated that it was better to risk keeping a de-fanged Hussein in power than to risk dismembering Iraq.
Now, officials conclude, that assessment was wrong. Perhaps, paradoxically, it was the Kurdish and Shiite rebellions just after the war that led Sunni military officers to rally to Mr. Hussein, but the Iraqi leader has not become more vulnerable. Even worse in an election year, his taunting of United Nations inspectors reminds Americans that he is still around. The value of getting rid of him increased as pro-Clinton bumper stickers began appearing on the cars of unemployed auto workers -- "Saddam Hussein Has a Job. Do You?"
 
The Latest 'Ism'
 The evolution of Administration thinking about militant Islamic fundamentalism also played into the reassessment. In a speech in June outlining Administration policy, Edward P. Djerejian, an Assistant Secretary of State, stressed that America would not seek to portray Islam as the latest "ism" to be fought -- a natural successor to the cold war which in the 1960's prompted the United States, Saudi Arabia and even Israel to support militantly Islamic groups as a bulwark against Godless communism, the same groups that now threaten American interests in the region. Washington, Mr. Djerejian said, has no quarrel with the great Muslim religion, but rather with those who use religious cover to espouse extremism, violence, intolerance and terrorism, and who use democracy to gain power and destroy democracy. In an interview last week he named some culprits: the Shiite group Hezbollah in Lebanon, Sunni Muslim Hamas in the Israeli-occupied territories, and the Governments of Sudan, and, of course, Iran.
Yet despite the Administration's obvious antipathy to Iran's support for Hezbollah, its fears of Iran's designs on southern Iraq (which Iranian officials adamantly deny), Washington, he said, is prepared to engage in a "dialogue" with Iran. It is Iran that has refused to talk.
Absent such a dialogue, the perceived threat of Iranian meddling in southern Iraq has not changed dramatically. And the Administration is obviously still concerned about what might happen there should Baghdad lose effective sovereignty. Administration officials, for example, are known to oppose sending arms and aid to the Iraqi Shiites to fight Saddam by creating an Iraqi Shiite mujahedeen, as they did in Afghanistan.
But absent such support, Ms. Mylroie says, Hussein will cling to power. The Administration, she argues, still has no actual strategy for getting rid of him if he does not rise to this provocation. "What we've had," she says, "is a tactical shift when a strategic one is required."
Nevertheless, the shift reflects a marked change in priorities. Whatever risks inherent in the no-fly zone are now outweighed by the dangers of doing nothing to try to hasten Mr. Hussein's ouster. The Administration's fear of Islamic fundamentalism, justified or not, has taken second place to Mr. Bush's need to appear a man of action. The Administration has found a new, if temporary "ism" to oppose in the Middle East -- Saddam has replaced the Red Menace.

HEADLINE: Conversations/Juzo Itami;
A Director Boasts of His Scars, and Says He Is Right About Japan's Mob

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Drawing his finger along a fresh scar stretching from one end to the other of his famous craggy cheek, and then across the soft flesh behind his ear, which had also been disfigured, Juzo Itami described how three gangsters had toyed with his life.
"They cut very slowly; they took their time," he said. "They could have killed me if they wanted." 
 Like violent runes, the series of pale lines carved professionally in the face of one of Japan's most respected film directors in May spelled out a gruesome message. It was a warning that one should not challenge, as Mr. Itami has in his latest film, the integral role that organized crime groups play in Japanese society. Indeed, for decades few had.
Mr. Itami tried to demonstrate in the movie, to be called "Minbo -- or the Gentle Art of Japanese Extortion," when it is released in the United States later this year, that the mobsters are paper tigers whose ferocity crumbles when confronted with careful resistance. But does the attack prove him wrong?
"The fact that I was attacked proves that what I pointed out in my film was correct," he insisted, in one of his first interviews since the assault on May 22, a week after the film opened. "If I was wrong they wouldn't have reacted so strongly.
"I pointed out the truth, and they wanted to stop this information from spreading," he added. "In a way, it was a very subtle way for them to try and make it seem there was some contradiction."
The attack on the roguishly handsome Mr. Itami, who at 59 years old has pursued successful careers as an actor, screen writer and director, was just one reminder of how deep the problem of organized crime runs today in Japan. A new law took effect earlier this year granting the police new powers in cracking down on the yakuza, which the gangsters have fought. This made Mr. Itami's movie that much more timely.
Then last week, Shin Kanemaru, the kingmaker of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, admitted he had accepted an unreported 500 million yen cash contribution from the head of a trucking concern with extensive mob connections. One article said Mr. Kanemaru had dined several times with the head of the second-largest yakuza group in the country.
 
Shocking Badge of Honor
 If such signs of influence have made some think twice about challenging the gangs, Mr. Itami is not among them. He boasts of his scars and brandishes a shocking photo of his wounds, taken shortly after the assault, like a badge of honor. It brings out a side to this pre-eminent satirist of modern Japanese ways that is not often in view -- immense pride and a sense that the Japanese ought to do better standing up for themselves as individuals.
Mr. Itami is best known in the West for "Tampopo," a hilarious send-up of Japanese noodle-eating habits, and "A Taxing Woman," which turns the adventures of a tax inspector into a revealing look at the Japanese penchant for tax evasion.
He is nearly 6 feet tall, which meant that his head just about grazed the beams in his sleekly modern office in an apartment building in Roppongi, a popular entertainment district in Tokyo. The office is an elegant mix of contemporary and traditional. The modest-sized room is surrounded by matched grain, natural wood panels, with impressive stereo and video systems resting just behind the straw tatami mats, where he conducted an interview sitting cross-legged at a low Japanese-style table.
But the reminders of his ordeal are never far away. He said that his summer had felt even hotter than usual because he had been unable to escape to his country home on the nearby Izu peninsula, Tokyo's Hamptons.
"It's the police, who secretly watch me all the time,"he said. "They say it would be too dangerous to go to my house."
The yakuza have long been pictured in popular films and novels as principled if earthy characters, who break the laws of mainstream society but follow their own code of honor. The reality, of course, was far different. Everyone knew that their central weapon was violent intimidation and that their strength came from their numbers, not their courage.
But the myth, in a way, provided an excuse for years of tolerance of the yakuza, who co-existed with the police as shadow enforcers in their own world. The recent police crackdown is an attempt to change that, but a series of scandals have shown how the yakuza have entered the economic mainstream in recent years, with connections not only to top politicians but also major corporations.
For Mr. Itami, this power represents not just a loss of control to the underworld, but a loss of self-esteem for the Japanese. He said he resents most the way the yakuza break peoples' spirit and pride to extract money. Their favorite means of earning money is extortion schemes, which generally involve humiliating their victims and demanding payments for fabricated slights and wrongs.
 
Culture of Death
 Mr. Itami said the recent scandals and the highly publicized attack against himself have started to change attitudes. He admitted that the evidence is thin but he said that in a nation of people extremely sensitive to the prevailing winds of opinion there is a growing sense of disapproval of the yakuza.
In his next film, Mr. Itami will be pursuing another theme related to this notion of holding on to one's pride. Death, as he puts it, is the film's central character. The film is his rejection of the way the modern Japanese have tried to banish it from their lives. "Traditionally, when people were about to pass away they stayed at home, surrounded by the people close to them," Mr. Itami said.
"The dying person was the central actor. People had this idea of a gallant death, done with deep bravery. People around them accepted the fact that this person is about to pass away and communicated with them. There was a culture of death.
"People now use science," he added. "Science means the defeat of death. They no longer want to look death in the face. Death is worthless, scary, like something you flush from your house. You take this person to the hospital because you don't want this thing to happen in your house."
Mr. Itami is clearly trying to explore what he regards as some of the more penetrating themes of Japanese society, but he did admit to some discouragement. The film industry in Japan is shrinking. His anti-yakuza movie proves the point.
"The film's timing was very good, and the attack on me made people more interested," Mr. Itami said. "But even with all those elements it still only brought in 1.5 billion yen at the box office. This shows you the decline in the Japanese film industry. A few years ago it would have been 5 billion yen.
"When a Japanese wants to dream, they see Western films or animated films, not Japanese films," Mr. Itami said.
He discussed with some resentment the sums Japanese corporations were spending to buy studios in Hollywood, rather than investing the money in the Japanese film industry. "It's easy to buy your software from another company, but it's risky to buy an American company," he said. "I can't imagine they're capable of managing these companies."

HEADLINE: Payments to the Retired Loom Ever Larger

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
To the elderly they represent a sacred trust, their rightful due. To critics, "welfare for the well-off." To bureaucrats, they are "non-means-tested entitlements." And to politicians they are instruments of political suicide.
But for anyone who imagines curing the budget deficit, the huge, mostly tax-free benefits that flow to the elderly, mainly via Social Security and Medicare, present unavoidable targets -- money monsters that must be tamed. 
 If, as many economists think, the $300 billion deficit should be Public Issue No. 1, then these soaring payments should be Topic A. That does not mean that they will be discussed meaningfully in this Presidential campaign.
The President has ducked the issue, proposing a cap on entitlement programs without saying who should suffer, and exempting Social Security. Bill Clinton, who pilloried Paul Tsongas during the primaries for suggesting mild curbs on payments to the rich, now seems intent on obscuring his own hesitant notion that those payments should be taxed. Even Ross Perot, who called the deficit "the crazy aunt you try to hide in the basement," flinched when asked about reducing benefits for rich retirees, saying that maybe it should be voluntary.
"If current trends continue, conflict between the generations is inevitable," says Mr. Tsongas, who now is trying to mobilize the public to fight the deficit.
Whatever the politics, "entitlement" programs -- those for which spending is determined by formulas set in law rather than by Congressional appropriations -- are engulfing the budget. They now account for more than half of all Federal spending. Four-fifths of them are not "means-tested," or linked to the incomes of recipients. Dominating the scene are the benefits offered to the elderly.
In 1993, Social Security alone is expected to surpass defense as the largest single item in the Federal budget, paying out $302 billion, a fifth of all Federal spending, Congressional Budget Office projections say. Medicare is expected to cost less -- $146 billion, but its costs are climbing much faster.
No one suggests that affluent retirees are entirely responsible for the deficit, or the entire answer. Rather, it is the sense that these programs are taboo that troubles many. "If you talk of imposing pain on those most capable of bearing that pain, or distributing the sacrifice most equitably, I think you can make a fairly strong case that the upper-income elderly should bear a portion of that sacrifice," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office.
"From a substantive point of view, there's no question" that benefits for the elderly should be trimmed, said Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who runs the House Budget Committee. "But from a political point of view, you're challenging what are probably the toughest constituencies out there." Affluent senior citizens, he noted, "make their presence known."
John Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, says his organization accepts in principle the notion of shared sacrifice, but believes that the elderly are being used as scapegoats and that runaway medical costs are the real problem.
"Deficit reduction won't work if all it does is whack at everything and leave the fundamental causes unaddressed," he said.
But reducing benefits for the affluent elderly, however "affluent" is defined, is no budgetary panacea. In 1991, about 20 percent of all Social Security payments went to people with family incomes over $50,000, according to Federal data analyzed by Neil Howe of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Five percent went to those with family incomes over $100,000.
These numbers overstate the security of some recipients who have little income but live with better-off relatives. And over half the recipients have family incomes below $30,000 a year, although some hold substantial assets. Many barely scrape by: in 1990, 29 percent of people 65 or older lived with less than 125 percent of the official poverty line for the elderly -- less than $9,881 for a couple or $7,835 for a single person.
For big savings, new taxes or cuts in benefits would have to reach down to retirees in the middle range, even those with incomes around $30,000.
And even then, this is only a partial solution. The most common proposals for increasing taxation of Social Security benefits, for example, would raise an extra $6 billion to $24 billion in 1994. Not peanuts, but hardly enough to vanquish the deficit.
 
Social Security
Doing Well Right Now, But a Disaster Looms
 Viewed in isolation, Social Security is for now filling rather than draining Federal coffers. For the next two decades or so, until the baby boom generation starts to retire, the Social Security taxes collected will be much larger than the benefits paid out.
Whatever its short-term balance, though, any program that accounts for one-fifth of Federal spending presents a plump target -- and, to the extent that its benefits flow to the well-off, what many see as a fair one.
"You don't have to be part of the problem to be part of the solution," Mr. Reischauer said.
Common sense to many economists, but tinkering with Social Security benefits sounds like betrayal to many elderly people. Plaguing the debate is a wide misunderstanding about how Social Security actually works.
Many, perhaps most of the elderly believe they are simply getting back what they are owed, money they paid in during their careers. In fact, the average person retiring today will get benefits equal to what he or she paid in -- including employer matching contributions and interest -- after about 10 years of retirement, according to the Congressional Research Service. Every cent after that is a subsidy paid by current workers.
 
Only a Paper Surplus
 "Social Security has been sold to the public as if it were a saving scheme," said Benjamin Friedman, an economist at Harvard University. "But people who are now retired are receiving back vastly more than anything that corresponds to a market return on what they paid in." In turn, younger workers can expect to get back less than they contributed during their working years.
For now, taxes are far greater than payments. But when the income and payment lines cross -- an event now expected in the year 2015 as baby boomers retire en masse -- there will be no pot of savings on which to draw. Rather, there will be a pile of i.o.u.'s from the Treasury, because the Social Security trust fund is invested in non-marketable Federal securities. The surplus in the trust fund is only a paper one.
Congress at that point will either have to raise Social Security taxes, use other revenues or cut benefits. By 2025, the annual shortfall will total $60 billion in today's dollars, according the the Congressional Research Service.
Perhaps the most commonly voiced proposal for trimming Social Security is to limit the annual Cost of Living Adjustment, which accounts for a large share of program growth. Some suggest holding the increase below the consumer price index each year, or skipping the increase in some years.
The idea appeals to politicians: How much can someone complain about a percentage point or two? In truth, it hurts the poor the most, and holding the increase just 2 percentage points below the price index over 10 years would mean a huge cut of more than 20 percent.
Fairer and more rational, in the view of most economists and budget experts, would be to make more benefits subject to the income tax, which would protect those with low incomes. Since 1983, individuals with incomes over $25,000 and couples over $32,000 have paid income tax on half their Social Security benefits. Still, middle-income elderly people pay less than half the total taxes of younger families with comparable incomes.
"If you could get most members of Congress in a dark closet, they will tell you that we ought to be taxing more of Social Security benefits than we are today," said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "Liberals and conservatives, away from the press, say that is the way to do it."
If Social Security were treated the same way as private pensions -- with the funds that were not previously subject to taxes being taxed at the time they are received -- then about 85 percent of benefits, rather than half, would be taxed.
And if the income threshold below which no benefits are taxed were eliminated, $24 billion would be raised in 1994.
 
Medicare
Doctors' Bills Send Costs Out of Control
 While Social Security costs are rising steadily, those for Medicare and Medicaid are soaring.
Medicare is the health insurance program for everyone 65 and older; it is partly paid for by payroll taxes and premiums paid by recipients, but requires a growing subsidy. Medicaid is the smaller but still gigantic program that covers care for the poor and nursing-home care for many of the elderly; its costs are paid from Federal and state taxes.
Controlling medical costs is today's apple pie issue, but there is little agreement about who will take the hit. Will providers be paid less, will patients pay more, or will services be rationed?
Proposing a cap on Medicare without specifying how to allocate the pain, as the White House has done, "is like saying the waves shall not advance," Mr. Aaron said. "You need a large scale reform of health care financing for the nation as a whole."
Whatever is done to contain medical costs, the more sensitive issue for the elderly is whether those who can afford it should pay more. One proposal is to raise the Medicare premiums for insurance that covers services outside the hospital. These premiums now cover only one-fourth of the real cost. Another approach uses the income tax. Taxing the subsidy value of Medicare would distribute the burdens more fairly, and could raise $15 billion a year by 1997.
Mr. Aaron said that benefits for the elderly may not be as untouchable as they seem. In 1983, he chaired the Federal advisory commission that proposed taxing some Social Security benefits for the first time. "The reaction was overwhelmingly and unanimously, 'Are you crazy?' " he recalled. Nonetheless, the 50 percent tax passed, and Congressional heads did not roll.
Mr. Bush, not wanting his lips read again, has steered clear of any proposals that might be construed as tax increases. But Mr. Clinton, when pressed, has clearly left the door open. He treads a careful, and perhaps intentionally obscure, line. On Aug. 10, for example, in response to a question on "CBS This Morning," he said: "I won't dip into Social Security benefits. I think you pay for them, you're entitled to get them. It's a trust . . . "
But he continued: "I do believe that there are people with high incomes . . . with annual incomes well in excess of $100,000 a year, who are getting Social Security benefits way over what they ever paid for. And only half of that income is subject to taxation. So, for upper income people, I think more of that should be subject to taxation."
To get through Congress, any changes in benefits for the elderly will have to be part of a much broader package, spreading the sacrifices widely. Whether the association of retired persons would cooperate, said Mr. Rother, its chief lobbyist, "depends on what else is there."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Democrats as the Devil's Disciples

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
During the celebrated trials in Salem, Mass., children fell into writhing fits at the sight of an accused witch. That was, of course, 300 years ago, when the fear of witchcraft was common. It couldn't happen again.
 Or could it? 
 So intense are the political passions of 1992 that the Rev. Pat Robertson, a former and possibly future Republican candidate for President, prophesies that children may again be foaming at the mouth as victims of sorcery in modern America.
Mr. Robertson warned that a proposed equal rights amendment to the Iowa state constitution was part of a "feminist agenda" that he described as "a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians."
President Bush, fortunately, has had no such apocalyptic "vision thing" as that. And Mr. Robertson's jeremiad on witchcraft and infanticide in Iowa was not a product of the Republican National Convention in Houston or issued on behalf of the Republican Party. Some Republicans, moreover, professed to be backing away last week from the "religious war" that Patrick Buchanan proclaimed at the Houston convention.
The evangelist-politician was writing, instead, on behalf of the Christian Coalition, an organization that arose from the hot ashes of his 1988 Presidential campaign. Representatives of the Christian Coalition virtually dominated that convention and the platform Mr. Bush accepted; and the Robertson letter fit snugly into a pattern of dire Republican threats that a Democratic victory would abandon the nation to debauchery and deviltry.
Mr. Buchanan, another former and future Republican Presidential candidate, had the delegates up and roaring with his none-too-subtle suggestion that Democrats are sexually weird -- his charge that "20,000 liberals and radicals" had gathered at the Democratic National Convention in New York "dressed up as moderates and centrists in the greatest single exhibition of cross-dressing in American political history."
In the first days of the campaign, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a purveyor of brimstone if ever there was one, pounced on the sexual theme. The Democrats, he said, had a "Woody Allen plank" in their platform because "they have no concept of families."
The President later picked up Mr. Buchanan's notion of a "religious war." He told a campaign audience that the Democrats had written thousands of words into their platform while leaving out the letters "G-O-D."
The nation was warned, during and after the convention, that Hillary Clinton is not only a radical feminist but favors children suing their parents; that if her husband is elected President, homosexuals and lesbians will take over the Oval Office and "environmental extremists" the economy; and that Mr. Clinton's past marital problems showed that he could not be trusted, even to defend the country from foreign assault, much less to guard it against the alien manipulations of a "media elite."
The tried-and-true crime issue also might have been resurrected when Vice President Quayle made the bizarre suggestion that Governor Clinton is a closet opponent of the death penalty -- even though the Governor had let several executions go forward in Arkansas, including one in 1992. But he once had said that Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York would be a good choice for the Supreme Court. Mr. Cuomo does oppose the death penalty -- and that was all the evidence Dan Quayle needed to suggest that Mr. Clinton was hiding what might really be soft-on-crime views.
Fear led to the "witch hunt" in Salem in 1692. It might be too strong to call the early Republican campaign of 1992 another witch hunt. But these claims and charges were not only directed at the presumed fears of Americans; these fears seemed actually to reflect the profound convictions of many of those who met in Houston.
If so, fear is a theology as well as a strategy. A strategy largely based on fear worked in 1988, but 1992 is different in at least two ways. One is a slumping economy, now perhaps moving into a "triple-dip" recession. In hard times, most Americans expect the Government, personified by the President, to act. Polls show they expect no less of George Bush in 1992 -- at least that he say more than he has about the economic action he plans to take in a second term.
The other difference is a Democratic Presidential candidate far more willing to fight back than Michael Dukakis was for much of 1988. Whatever else may be thought of Bill Clinton, he already has shown himself to be a tough and resilient candidate, able to hand out punishment as well as take it. And he, too, knows how to play the fear game -- witness his claim that Mr. Bush, having broken his word once and raised taxes, cannot be trusted not to do it again.
No doubt influenced by post-convention polls, Mr. Bush's senior political adviser, Charles Black, repudiated Mr. Gingrich's linkage of Woody Allen's troubles to the Democrats. William J. Bennett, the former Secretary of Education, conceded that the election did not pit "the forces of light against the forces of darkness."
But you'd never have known that if you were watching the televised sessions from Houston. And it's early yet. The roots of fear -- religious, sexual, social -- seem to lie deep in American life and particularly among the so-called conservatives who dominated the Houston convention. If coaxed into malodorous growth in the two remaining months of the campaign, the theology of fear may prove more effective than the strategy.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
RISING COMPLAINTS OF PRICE GOUGING

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 29

 BODY:
With supplies of ice, basic foods and building materials scarce and many restaurants and gas stations still closed in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, state officials said today that complaints of price gouging were pouring in.
"There are people charging $5 for a bag of ice that normally costs $1," said Robert A. Butterworth, Florida's Attorney General. "They are charging $125 for a motel room that was $35 before the storm." 
 By midday Saturday, the Attorney General's office and the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services had received nearly 2,500 complaints. Callers reported tuna fish at $8 a can, $15 for a gallon of water, gasoline selling at $2 a gallon, candy bars priced at $4, and $200 chain saws selling for $900.
 
'It's Disgusting'
 "It's disgusting," said Toni Riordan, a spokeswoman for Florida's Department of Community Affairs, which is coordinating the state's response to the disaster.
Mr. Butterworth said he believed that most businesses that have reopened had not raised their prices. He also said many people who have set up roadside businesses in the heart of the disaster zone were selling things at fair prices.
One of those selling items on the road was Jon Kyseth, who owns a used car lot in Charleston, S.C. He had set up shop along a devastated stretch of highway framed by downed power lines and shredded trees. His car is his warehouse, he said, and the car's hood his showcase for flashlights, chain saws, work gloves and bottles of propane gas.
"I went through Hurricane Hugo," Mr. Kyseth said, "so I know people need these things. I drove down here thinking I could make some money but also help these people, give them fair prices and make sure they don't get gouged the way we did in Charleston."
 
Comparing Gougers to Looters
 Mr. Butterworth, who has nearly 40 investigators and lawyers working on the complaints, said, "As far I'm concerned, there's no difference between a looter and a person whose gouging victims of this disaster."
Mr. Butterworth said violaters of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act face fines of up to $10,000. He said officials of Dade County, where the worst of the hurricane damage occurred, have made price gouging a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine and up to 60 days in jail. The state is intervening, aids to Mr. Butterworth said, because the economy has been disrupted and some merchants have gained an unfair advantage.
Mr. Butterworth's office said more than 75 subpoenas for sales records have been issued so far, including seven to major national companies. No arrests have been made yet.
Most of the business people accused by customers and investigators of price gouging have tried to shift responsibility for the higher prices.
"The retailers tell us it's the wholesalers and the wholesalers say it's the retailers," said Mona Fandel, the Attorney General's Chief of Consumer Affairs. "Everybody blames everybody else. That's why we're issuing subpoenas."
Many business people and those selling items on the roadside insisted they were doing a public service, going out of their way to provide critically needed supplies and equipment. Many of their customers agreed.
In the heavily damaged town of Naranja, Ed McKelvey, the vice president of the M.C.R. Lumber Company, was scrunched down on an office chair in a patch of drying mud, selling roofing paper and nails as fast as he could make change.
Tar paper was selling for $15 a roll, compared with $8 before the storm. "The wholesalers shot the price up," Mr. McKelvey said. "We're adding 50 cents or $1 to the price. We're trying to make as much available to the community as we can. Believe me, for a dollar a roll I don't need to be out here."
Hilda Olvera, who manages a McDonald's Restaurant, was buying tar paper for the first time. She had no idea what it ought to cost. "It seems reasonable to me," she said as a young man filled her trunk.
Many of those selling items on the roadside said they were selling at or below standard prices.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
A Contest of 2 Generations, Molded by 2 Different Wars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
With both nominating conventions completed and the fall race begun, the 1992 election has emerged as a generational contest of unusual intensity and scope, a choice between two men of two very different epochs, shaped by two very different wars.
The 68-year-old George Bush may be the last President of the age of World War II, the war in which every President since Harry S. Truman has served, excepting Jimmy Carter, who was a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy during the war. The 46-year-old Bill Clinton, born a year after that war ended, is the first Presidential nominee of the age of the Vietnam war.
 
Peril for Both Candidates
 Over this week and last, the old, unresolved differences between the time of America's good war and that of its failed war have begun to occupy a place at the center of the 1992 race, informing debates on matters ranging from party ideology to personal morals. 
 It is, the events of this week showed, a discussion that holds peril for both sides.
On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton had to stand before the American Legion and offer, as he put it, "one final statement" on how he had come to not go to Vietnam. His incomplete explanation left Republicans gleefully convinced that they have in this issue the perfect means by which to portray the Democrat as a closet hippie and a dishonest man.
 
Cooling on 'Family Values'
 But the "family values" debate that is rooted in these generational politics, and that the Republicans began with a great, angry to-do in their nominating convention in Houston, appeared by this week to have very nearly backfired, repelling as many voters as it had reached. By midweek, senior Bush Administration and campaign officials had called for a cooling of the hot-button talk.
The differences between the 1940's and the 1960's, and between Mr. Clinton's age and Mr. Bush's, shape the way each candidate depicts the choice between them.
In the choice as portrayed by the Democrats, Mr. Clinton is John F. Kennedy, the young, vigorous candidate poised to lead the country into an exciting (but not radical) era of growth and change, a time of bold experiments in leadership. Mr. Bush, in this picture, is an old, stuck-in-his-ways, golf-playing duffer, incapable of seizing the historical moment. "Change" is the keyword of Mr. Clinton's campaign.
In the choice as portrayed by the Republicans, Mr. Bush is Dwight D. Eisenhower, the sober, sensible steward, shaped by the ways of the old, good days, and imbued with the half-mythic values of those days. He does not promise so much to induce change as to manage it, and he does not promise to make things better as much as he warns that his opponent will make them a great deal worse. Mr. Clinton, in this view, does not represent the promise of the early 1960's but the traumas of the decade's later years; he is a secret radical hiding behind the mask of moderatism. "Trust" is Mr. Bush's answer to Mr. Clinton's "change."
Nowhere is the generational contrast between Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton sharper -- and a cause of greater hope to Republican strategists -- than in the matter of who did what in each generation's war. Mr. Bush, acting in a manner fairly typical of the men of his class and time, was an officer and gentleman-hero of his war; Mr. Clinton, acting in a manner fairly typical of the men of his class and time, was a protester and an avoider of his.
 
Making Their Cases
 On Tuesday, both men stood before the audience at an American Legion convention and made cases for themselves that centered on just this matter.
"You know that I never served in the military," Mr. Clinton told the veterans. "You know that I opposed the war in Vietnam. But I want you to know this: I was never against the heroic men who served in that war. I honored their service then, and I honor it still."
He went on: "If any of you here choose to vote against me because of what happened 23 years ago, that is your right as an American citizen, and I respect it. But I hope that you will cast your vote looking toward the future rather than remaining fixed to the problems of the past."
Mr. Bush began by casting back 20 years before 1960 to, as he put it, "the world we knew," a phrase that evoked remembered youth and old songs. "Fifty years ago this summer, America is at war," he said. "At the age of 18, I went off to fight. Like many of you, I was scared, but I was willing. And I was young, but I was ready. And like so many of you, I had barely lived when I began to watch men die."
 
Clinton Stressed the Theme
 The generational theme began with Mr. Clinton; it has been present since the inception of his campaign, when he spoke in October 1991 of an America "on the threshold of a new era, a new millennium," and used the word "generation" four times in the first six paragraphs.
At the Democratic convention in New York last month, Mr. Clinton imitated Mr. Kennedy in a well-choreographed appearance in the convention hall the night before his acceptance speech, and the biographical movie that preceded Mr. Clinton's speech featured President Kennedy, in a moment heavy with torch-passing symbolism, shaking hands with an awe-struck 16-year-old Bill Clinton.
In their convention, and in the week since, the Republicans have sought to turn this argument for generational change sharply against Mr. Clinton, by reminding voters that he is not really of Mr. Kennedy's generation (Mr. Kennedy shared Mr. Bush's war, not Mr. Clinton's) but Abbie Hoffman's, and to link the Democrat with a decade remembered unhappily by many as a time when liberalism was turned into radicalism.
In a convention speech that opened this effort, Marilyn Quayle said: "Much has been said lately about the need in this country for a new generation of leadership; that the moment has come for a couple of baby boomers to take the helm of this great and complex nation; that the time has come for generational change."
She then said, with Mr. Clinton clearly in mind: "Not everyone joined the counterculture, not everyone demonstrated, dropped out, took drugs, joined in the sexual revolution or dodged the draft. Not everyone concluded that American society was so bad that it had to be radically remade by social revolution."
 
Broadening the Attack
 Other speakers broadened the generational attack. Hillary Clinton, whom friends at Yale recall as a committed leftist, and who has left a trail of legal writings and involvement with advocacy groups that place her clearly closer to the left edge of liberalism than her husband seems to be, was brought into play as a sort of stand-in for Mr. Clinton. The suggestion in the Republican strategy was that she represents the views Mr. Clinton secretly holds, too, but will not admit.
The "family values" assault was generational, too, contrasting the warm appeal of the idealized 1950's family as embodied in "Father Knows Best" with the equally idealized depiction of single motherhood in today's "Murphy Brown."
This approach, on its face, would seem to offer promise for Mr. Bush and peril to Mr. Clinton. It is, after all, rooted in fact. Mr. Clinton is a product of his generation. He did demonstrate against the war, he has (sort of) acknowledged smoking marijuana, and he has been the subject of much sexual gossip. Most important, he did avoid the draft during the Vietnam war.
 
Clinton's Vulnerability
 This last issue, which Republican strategists plan to make much, illuminates the vulnerability Mr. Clinton faces in matters related to his generation.
In his efforts to avoid Vietnam, Mr. Clinton first worked his way through academic deferments. When these were no longer available, and after he had received an induction notice while attending Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, he promised to join the Reserve Officers Training Corps at the University of Arkansas. In the fall of 1969, after President Richard M. Nixon had announced that draft-eligible students like Mr. Clinton could finish the school year before induction, and proposed a lottery system to select inductees, Mr. Clinton put himself forward for the draft. He drew a high number in the lottery and was never drafted.
Mr. Clinton has said repeatedly that he exposed himself, however briefly, to the draft because he felt it was the honorable thing to do. But on Dec. 3, 1969, two days after the lottery showed he was safe, Mr. Clinton wrote an extraordinary letter to the Army colonel who had supervised the R.O.T.C. program at the University of Arkansas.
In the letter, he thanked the colonel for "saving me from the draft," acknowledged that he had misled the colonel about his intentions and views on the war and said that he had "decided to accept the draft in spite of my beliefs for one reason: to maintain my political viability within the system."
 
Changing Accounts
 Moreover, the statements Mr. Clinton made about his wartime actions when the subject first came up this year do not hang together well. He was quoted in news reports in the spring as saying he had never received an induction notice, and later as saying he was not sure. In his remarks to the American Legion, he acknowledged having received the induction notice before signing up for the R.O.T.C.
Speaking to reporters the day after Mr. Clinton spoke to the American Legion, Charles Black, a senior political adviser to the Bush campaign, identified this area as "an issue of huge vulnerability" that, he cheerfully admitted, he was "trying to stir up interest in."
Mr. Black made it clear that the Republicans regard Mr. Clinton as vulnerable on this issue not because he did not fight, but because Mr. Clinton's maneuverings around the draft and his varied explanations of those maneuverings lend resonance to the core Republican assertion, that he is misrepresenting his generational self, hiding from the voters what he really stands for. "He has to put this draft issue to rest and the credibility issues that surround it, and he certainly didn't do it yesterday," he said.
 
Possible Strategy Weakness
 But the appearances by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush before the veterans also illustrates what may be a great weakness in the Republican strategy. Appearing before a group of men who could be expected to be receptive to the Republican's continuing attack, Mr. Clinton received a notably warm reception -- about as warm as that accorded Mr. Bush.
Polls taken in the days since the convention have found a lack of interest among voters in debating such things as the rights of homosexuals and the ways of radical feminists. What the voters did seem to be interested in hearing about was the economy, health care and crime. It may be that most people are finally tired of fighting about who did what in the cultural wars.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
For Red Cross, the Chance To Help and Raise Money

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Overwhelmed by the scope of Hurricane Andrew's destruction in South Florida and Louisiana, the American Red Cross has begun a national appeal for money to support its relief effort.
Some of the appeal's immediate success -- million-dollar gifts from corporations and foundations -- reflect the dual role of disasters in the Red Cross's existence in highlighting the group's mission and providing a backdrop for fund-raising efforts. This week, for instance, Elizabeth Dole, the president of the American Red Cross, was soliciting money for both the immediate needs of South Florida and the longer-term needs of the Red Cross's disaster relief program. 
 At the same time, emergency officials are publicly grumbling about a Red Cross effort that, they say, plays better in the press releases from national headquarters than it does in the disaster areas.
The criticisms, from people like Kate Hale at the Emergency Operations Center in Dade County, often try to distinguish between the local volunteers, some of whom have worked tirelessly to supply shelter, food and water for the newly homeless, and the national organization.
After an appearance Wednesday night with Mrs. Dole on the CNN program "Larry King Live," Ms. Hale complained to reporters in Miami that the Red Cross chief was exaggerating the number of shelters in operation.
 
Housing 85,000
 But it is hard this early to quantify what the nation's best-known relief organization has done to help the victims of Hurricane Andrew. Of the more than 200 shelters opened by Red Cross around the state in Florida on Sunday, housing at least 85,000 people as Hurricane Andrew neared the coast, 14 remained open Friday, housing 2,071 people, the group said.
The Red Cross is also a conduit for the thousands of volunteers it has on standby in case of disasters. Like those in Dade County who were transformed by the hurricane this week into shelter directors, they are prepared to abandon their jobs until the crisis passes.
"It's a massive responsibility to be ready for a disaster anywhere on American soil," said Mrs. Dole, the former Labor Secretary who has led the Red Cross since 1991, in an interview on Tuesday in Miami. She spoke about her responsibilities: raising money for disaster relief, and allocating it to get the most assistance possible to the greatest number of people.
' "In California alone in the last three years we've had earthquakes, the Oakland fire and the riots in Los Angeles," she said. "Fund-raising has become a big part of what I'm doing."
While a disaster like Hurricane Andrew is both a chance to meet human needs and an instant showcase for the Red Cross's humanitarian mission and need for donations, local government relief agencies reap nothing from disaster but big problems and bigger bills, a situation that can produce frictions.
Such was the situation in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California. San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos and other officials who had helped raise contributions from local businesses were furious to see some of the $52.2 million earmarked for the earthquake-ravaged areas being appropriated for use elsewhere. The Red Cross later agreed to use the money in the area.
Fund-raising is central to the Red Cross's existence. Private donations are one of the most important sources of funding for the Red Cross. Most of these come regularly from the network of 2,100 local United Ways, which, on average, provide 70 percent of the funding of local Red Cross chapters.
Nationally, the Red Cross and its local chapters have a budget of $1.4 billion. About $800 million is raised and spent in its blood donation program, which is kept separate from the rest of the group's operations, said John Campbell, the vice president for finance at the American Red Cross.
About $150 million of the remaining $600 million goes to national headquarters to pay for donations to international relief efforts, services to the armed forces (such as informing military personnel of births and deaths in their families), management and disaster services. More than 2,600 local chapters use the remaining $450 million to provide services in their communities.
However the money is distributed, the Red Cross said, their resources to meet human needs has been strained by a series of disasters on American soil since Hurricane Hugo. "Just like Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake, we don't have the funds to fund Andrew," said Mr. Campbell. "We have to fund-raise."
The timing may not be right. Local United Ways chapters are nervous over whether their fund-raising efforts will be hurt by a recent scandal over lavish perquisites for officials in the national office. The economy may also have an effect.
 
Falling Short
 In fiscal year 1990, Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta earthquake in northern California were the big-ticket items in a period when the American Red Cross spent a record $224.2 million on disaster relief. But publicity about the disasters helped fill the coffers of the national headquarters' Disaster Relief Fund, a $30 million reserve for times when the money budgeted for disaster relief fall short.
Since then, however, the number of disasters grew while their visibility decreased. The Red Cross spent $184.4 million in fiscal 1991, which ran from July 1990 through June 1991, for relief of floods in Texas, mudslides in Puerto Rico and floods in American Samoa, without the publicity and contributions produced by a hurricane or earthquake. The disaster relief reserve was depleted.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
Ailing Louisiana Now Has to Recover From Storm

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARENTON, La., Aug. 28

 BODY:
Driven from their ruined homes -- three dark, damp cabins with freshly punctured roofs -- Leroy Hose, his family and his neighbors sat outside, surveying another calamity in the fields all around them.
Wilting under the heavy heat that follows a hurricane, a sugar cane crop lay all twisted, flailed and muddy. 
 Teen-age girls took turns curling each other's hair while Mr. Hose listened to an old blues song on a tape recorder running off his car battery. The crop does not belong to them. It belongs to the same grower who owns the old, sagging cabins and pays the men $4.80 an hour to work the fields.
 
Post-Hurricane Arithmetic
 Mr. Hose has already calculated the trickle-down economics of a natural disaster. "If Uncle Sam doesn't take care of the boss, the boss doesn't get a profit," he said. "If there's no profit, there's no work, and if I don't work, the kids don't eat."
All along the swath Hurricane Andrew cut through southern Louisiana, people are doing their own arithmetic. Instead of dealing with manifest catastrophes like a house or business in pieces, most of the storm's victims in Louisiana are agonizing over uncertainties, not knowing how quickly their homes will be repaired or how long their livelihoods will suffer.
And for some there are more immediate needs.
Sunlight filters through the rafters of Mr. Hose's cabin. Past a stack of mattresses beginning to mildew and a little pile of stuffed animals bloated with water, the ramshackle kitchen holds a valued cache: a few cans of pork and beans.
"We're getting real short on supplies right now," he said, "I heard help is coming, but how am I going to find it?"
 
Tens of Thousands Displaced
 Unknown to him, at least two relief kitchens were operating in towns less than 20 miles away, but down roads choked with tree limbs and power lines.
In Florida, relief officials have been overwhelmed by the hundreds of thousands of victims packed into areas of concentrated devastation. In Louisiana, where 25,000 to 30,000 people were displaced by the storm, according to Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, the challenge has been to reach victims scattered from the suburbs of New Orleans and Baton Rouge down through tiny, remote settlements deep in the coastal bayou country.
So far, relatively few complaints have been heard here about the overall size or speed of the relief effort, but there is growing impatience with the way it is being distributed.
"I know there are generators up the road, and there are some down the road," said Gus Lipari, Mayor of the small town of Patterson. "If I could get every generator that's been promised to me by one agency or another, I'd light up the state, but I haven't seen one of them."
Like many other communities, Patterson survived the initial storm damage almost solely with hometown efforts. The water was kept flowing with equipment provided by local businesses, and the streets are being cleared by volunteer crews who are fed by a local grocery.
But four days after the storm, worries about the future are beginning to set in. "By now I can see us getting past the emergency stage," said Mayor Lipari. "But I have a hard time seeing what kind of economy we're going to be left with."
 
Economy Already Battered
 Once the heart of a thriving energy industry, the area of south-central Louisiana hardest hit by the storm lost its economic glow when the price of oil fell in the 1980's. More recently it has suffered from a sharp drop in drilling.
This summer, hopes sprang from two directions. A bountiful oyster harvest was under way, and a bumper sugar cane crop was in the fields.
Now oystering has been suspended while state officials determine if the beds have been polluted, and many parts of the seafood industry face severe property damage. Governor Edwards has calculated that half the sugar crop was destroyed, for a loss of $200 million to an industry that has yet to recover from a freeze in 1989.
As Hurricane Andrew swept across the sugar belt, the counterclockwise circulation of its winds left the cane twisted and tangled.
"We like it standing up nice and straight," said Herman Louviere, who farms 2,200 acres of sugar near Jeanerette. "Now we've got to fight it all the way for the harvesting and the planting."
When the hurricane struck, farmers had just begun the planting process: taking cuttings from the current crop that will be laid out in furrowed fields to produce crops for the future. The twisted cane will not produce good cuttings, and when the current crop is harvested, probably in October, the tangled canes will jam harvesting machines and leave a great deal of cane in the fields as waste.
State Senator M. J. Foster, scion of an old land-owning family, captured the bleak mood of the hurricane's victims with a dire prediction. "This could be the end of the Louisiana sugar industry," he said, "and if the sugar goes, I don't know what we'll have left."
He stood on the portico of a fine Greek Revival plantation house built in 1837. With walls 16-inches thick, the mansion had survived with minor damaged, but there was ruin in the gardens for which Oaklawn Manor was named. Tourists by the bus loads have come to see the 40-acre grove of ancient live oaks, and now the long twisting limbs sculptured by nature over centuries lie on the ground in an impenetrable thicket of dead wood.
Mr. Foster ran through a chronology of recent calamities: busts, freezes and floods and now Hurricane Andrew.
"You can only take so much bad luck," he said.

HEADLINE: Entrepreneurs in China Attain the Age of Greed

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
James Shen is a tall, well-dressed 29-year-old who for the last five years has lived the Chinese dream: He has worked abroad for a Western company, earning a Western salary.
So when Mr. Shen, who sells flame-retardant chemicals for a British company, returned to his native Shanghai this month to visit friends, he had a rude surprise. 
 "I'd worked abroad, so I figured I was rich," he said over breakfast in the $105-a-night hotel where he is staying. "But I came back and discovered that I was poor. There are so many rich people here now, so many millionaires."
A dozen years of some of the highest economic growth rates in the world have nurtured the re-emergence in China of the super-rich, a class that the Chinese masses used to struggle against and now struggle to join. The average monthly salary in China may be less than $35 at the official rate of exchange, but for anyone who thinks of this as a nation of impoverished peasants wading in rice paddies, it is a shock to inspect the gleaming counters of Shanghai's Glorious Clock and Watch Shop.
"With consumer standards rising, we're planning to sell Rolexes soon," said Shi Guanghui, the middle-aged assistant manager of the shop, as he sneaked a disapproving peek at an American visitor's plastic digital watch. "A lot of other shops already have Rolexes."
Mr. Shi said he is already doing a brisk business selling Rado watches from Switzerland that cost as much as $3,000. The Rolexes will cost up to $20,000 each, and Mr. Shi said there would definitely be customers.
A potential customer is Su Yaopeng, who says he is in the real estate business. Mr. Su is doing well: last month he paid $55,000 in an auction for Shanghai license plate Z0518. It is regarded as an auspicious number because it sounds vaguely like the words for "make me rich."
 
No Longer Lean, Just Mean
 Meeting the needs of a changing society, the Chinese language has in the last few years come up with new expressions, "dakuan" and "kuanye," which are equivalent to "fat cats." The concept did not exist in more orthodox Communist days when everyone was supposed to be egalitarian -- and lean.
The dakuan can be found shopping in the boutiques of Nanjing Road, buying Italian suits or French cosmetics despite the huge tariffs that can make lipstick cost up to $50. Every now and then, they take a call on their cellular telephones and make a note to themselves with European fountain pens.
One place to spot the dakuan is in the new brokerage houses around Shanghai, where the elite come to play the stock market. The big players get special rooms where they can relax and watch trading on computer screens as they issue buy and sell orders.
At first, the brokers extended this privilege to anyone with more than $35,000 invested. But there were too many of those, so now an investor must have a stake of nearly $100,000 to get special treatment.
To be sure, most Chinese are still peasants who have never been to Shanghai and are lucky if they have electricity. The average peasant made $132 last year, and some can afford meat only once or twice a year. Yet at the same time, the ranks of the dakuan are growing very rapidly: about four million families have annual incomes of $5,500 or more, and there are 10,000 private cars around the country.
Typical of Shanghai's new dakuan is Gu Desheng, a tall 37-year-old with a high school education. Until 1984 he was a driver for a food company, earning about $10 a month, but then he quit and decided to do business on his own.
After making and selling toys for a few years, Mr. Gu amassed a bit of capital. He traded his apartment for one on the ground floor and last year turned it into an elegant restaurant -- the "We Happy Restaurant," a sign at the entrance proclaims in English, reflecting the fashion for English names.
Mr. Gu and his wife and child live in a tiny loft they built over the restaurant, and they put $20,000 in savings into refurbishing the restaurant. It is now equipped with stereo music, air-conditioning, a bar and a set of aquariums near the door to keep fish and snakes alive and squirming until customers order them for dinner.
With a monthly profit of $600 or more, and growing, Mr. Gu is now considering several other locations for additional restaurants.
"I've never heard of anyone in Shanghai not making money on a restaurant," Mr. Gu said. "Some people quit because they find it a lot of work, but nobody goes bankrupt."
 
Putting Everything on the Tab
 Some of the cash that the dakuan throw around is "heiqian" -- black money -- obtained through illegal means. Bribery, prostitution and smuggling are booming industries in coastal China. There is a black market in Beijing in fake receipts for food and lodging so officials can pad their expense accounts.
Still, most of the money is either honestly obtained or else is huiqian -- gray money -- from practices of uncertain legality. For example, an engineer recently developed a product using the premises of his employer, a state-owned company, and then sold it to a semi-private factory. He was rewarded with a new apartment and nearly $8,000.
"The wealth these days mostly isn't heiqian; it comes principally from business," said Wei Wenyuan, executive director of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. "The Chinese economy isn't very well developed, so people can go into sales and distribution and make money by taking advantage of price differences."
A couple of dozen students at Qinghua University are said to have earned $20,000 or more as sales representatives. One Beijing University senior, Huang Lin, earned enough by selling photocopiers that he reportedly invited some of his classmates out for an evening of karaoke singing -- and unflinchingly paid the $650 bill.
"Some kids have relatives who work in a factory and can arrange huge purchase orders," said a Shanghai art student. "Then the kids can sell a lot and make a mint."
One reason why private enterprise in China often prospers is that the competition comes largely from state-owned companies that are legendary for their sloth and discourteousness. State restaurants, for example, tend to offer cold, overpriced food served by rude waiters.
Zhang Fugen, a 55-year-old entrepreneur wearing a gold Bulova watch, ran a bustling restaurant out of his home by catering to people's tastes -- if they spoke with a Cantonese accent, he served food lightly stir-fried; if they spoke with a Sichuan accent, he added peppers. Mr. Zhang, who has since replaced the restaurant with a craft shop, says he has savings of $40,000.
"I'd say my life has improved a hundred times over," he said. 'Aside from my income going up, I've sent my two sons to study in Japan, and now they've got good jobs there as well."

HEADLINE: Iraq Softens Anger Over Air Quarantine in South

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Iraq tempered its angry response to American air patrols today and made what seemed to be an appeal for sympathy, conceding that the plan by the United States and its allies to take control of the skies in the south would further weaken the country.
The Government-run newspaper Al Jumhouriya said in an editorial that the United States and its allies had waged a long campaign to weaken Iraq through "wars, economic sanctions and partition plans." 
 The latest strategy, the newspaper said, threatens to put Iraq "in its weakest state" by creating "a southern pocket to dismember Iraq."
Since allied warplanes took to the air over southern Iraq on Thursday, flying reconnaissance patrols and vowing to strike against any Iraqi fighter south of the 32d parallel, Baghdad's air force has made no move to challenge the so-called no-fly zone.
 
Protecting Shiite Rebels
 The United States, Britain and France say the zone is needed to protect Shiite Muslim rebels in the south from assaults by Iraqi warplanes and helicopter gunships.
Though commentary was subdued today, Al Jumhouriya and other Baghdad newspapers insisted that the Iraqi people remained united behind President Saddam Hussein and would never submit to what is described here as a "colonialist-Zionist plot" to break up the country.
A senior official in Cairo said the Iraqi arguments appeared to be addressed mainly to Arab governments that have raised doubts about the allied strategy and refused to endorse it.
Kuwait has publicly supported the plan, though other Arab Gulf states, like Saudi Arabia, have provided extensive logistical support. But other governments, including Egypt, Syria and a number of Gulf states, have expressed concern that a weakened and unstable Iraq could break up and foster instability in the region.
"Iraq knows there is no point in arguing with the coalition, so they are trying to muster more sympathy and support among the Arabs, especially in the gulf," said the senior official here, a foreign affairs specialist.
 
Fears Over Iran
 There is particular concern that Iran's fundamentalist Shiite Government, which Arab governments regard as hostile, will exploit a power vacuum in southern Iraq.
The Iraqis, who have recently used ground forces as well as planes and helicopters to attack the Shiites, have said that they are pursuing rebels and Iranian infiltrators who are trying to overthrow Mr. Hussein's Government.
Unconfirmed reports this week from Iraqi dissident groups suggest that Baghdad may be using its ground forces to control the Shiites while it waits for the American-led allies to relax or end their air patrols.
In Beirut, an official of an Iraqi dissident group said today that the Baghdad Government had rounded up and arrested thousands of Shiite Muslims in the days before the United States and its allies began to enforce the ban on Iraqi flights south of the 32d parallel.
Sheik Abu Maythem al-Saghir, an official of a group that calls itself the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, estimated that 10,000 people were arrested earlier this week, mostly at random, in the cities of Basra, Amara, Nasiriya, Diwaniya and Najaf. There was no way to confirm that report independently.
The official Iraqi News Agency reported later that the Cabinet was briefed today in Baghdad on the air operation. The Cabinet vowed to treat the operation "with the disdain it deserves and meanwhile to continue the political and mobilizing activity inside and outside Iraq," the report said.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
TALES OF ROUNDUP IN NORTH
 GUSHTEPE, Iraq, Aug. 29 (AP) -- Drivers in northern Iraq said today that Iraqi security forces had rounded up a large number of Shiites in the region this week and taken them away on trucks as Western allies prepared to begin air patrols in the south.
The reports could not be independently confirmed. The roundup was described by drivers carrying goods and people between Kirkuk, a major Iraqi oil city, and the Kurdish-dominated region to the north. They were interviewed at a Kurdish guerrilla checkpoint near this village, just south of the Kurdish city of Erbil.
All of the drivers spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared retaliation by the Baghdad Government.
The first allegations that Shiites had been seized in the north were made on Friday by Kurds interviewed by a London-based television station run by opponents of President Saddam Hussein.
Iraq drew Shiites to Kirkuk from southern Iraq in the 1980's with promises of land and money to "Arabize" the city, which has a mainly Turkmen and Kurdish population.
Iraq's Shiites, who make up 55 percent of the country's 17.5 million people, are concentrated in the south, where Mr. Hussein is trying to suppress a rebel movement. Reports on Friday said security forces, including the elite Republican Guard corps, took Shiites to a military camp at Tob Zawa, just outside Kirkuk, last week. But the latest reports said the roundups took place within the last three or four days.
"The reports, if true, are extremely alarming," said Eric Goldstein of the New York-based human rights group Middle East Watch. He said on Friday that thousands of Kurds who were taken to Iraqi barracks at Tob Zawa during Mr. Hussein's 1987-88 campaign against the Kurds later disappeared.
Today, one driver said he saw 40 to 50 Shiite families removed by truck from Kirkuk. Another driver said he saw about 20 busloads of people whom he believed to be Shiites taken to the village of Mahmoor, about 30 miles southwest of Erbil.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Calls for an Inquiry Into Delays in Storm Relief

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Aug. 29

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton said today that an effort should be made to "look into" why problems have plagued the hurricane disaster-relief effort in Florida and Louisiana.
But he pulled up short of blaming President Bush for any of the troubles, saying he did not want to politicize the issue in an election and that any investigation should be carried out in "as nonpolitical a way as possible." 
 "I do believe an important job of a President is the management of disasters," the Democratic nominee told reporters here at an appearance before a wildlife group. "I think they need to look into it. But I don't want to get into assessing the blame there because I don't know what the facts were. We ought to look into how it can be changed for the future."
The Bush Administration has been hit by complaints over the past several days that it moved ineptly and too slowly to aid the victims of Hurricane Andrew, particularly in Florida.
Today, the Bush campaign said that Mr. Clinton, despite his claims to the contrary, was jumping on criticisms of the disaster relief for political advantage. "He's trying to exploit what is a terrible situation for political gain," said Torie Clarke, a campaign spokeswoman. "He should be ashamed of himself."
 
President Defends Response
 Yesterday, worried that the complaints about the relief effort might further erode his already weak position in the campaign, the President strongly defended his Administration's relief efforts, asserting that Federal disaster teams had responded "within a few hours."
"When we were asked to move," he said, "we moved these massive numbers of forces. But I'm not going to participate in the blame game."
While Mr. Clinton said he did not want to politicize the hurricane relief issue or blame the effort's shortcomings on President Bush, he did not hesitate to attack his opponent on a number of other issues today.
He asserted again this morning, as he had yesterday, that the Bush campaign was deliberately distorting his tax record. But unlike yesterday, he did not charge that his opponent's attacks called into question the "character" of the Bush campaign and constituted "raw cynicism."
The Bush campaign was quick to return the fire in what has become perhaps the most contentious and acerbic feud of the 1992 campaign.
Ms. Clarke, charged that the Governor had "sunk to new lows."
"Bill Clinton and his campaign," she added, "have resorted to name-calling and flat-out lying in an effort to distract the American voters from his tax-increase record and agenda."
 
Finger-Pointing Over Taxes
 The Bush campaign contends that Mr. Clinton has raised taxes and various fees 128 times since he became Governor. Clinton aides say the correct figure is 59. They also say that by their calculations the President not only broke his "read my lips" promise and imposed a tax increase as part of the budget compromise but also imposed other new taxes and fees at least 326 times.
Bush campaign officials said today they could not comment on the Clinton campaign figure of 327 increases but were confident once they added up the various increases, the true figure would be considerably less. They said they would make the figure available next week.
In his speech to the Arkansas Wildlife Federation, Mr. Clinton accused the President of neglecting the environment by putting economic needs before human needs.
And in a second speech today, to wildly cheering partisans attending the biennial Arkansas State Democratic Convention here, he said he was "desperately, desperately" trying to make the 1992 race a positive campaign but was constantly being thwarted by negative campaigning by the President.
"The present political climate has run us down," he said. "It has made us less than we ought to be. Every time we want to reach out or reach up, it diverts us."
Mr. Clinton asserted that in the end, the 1992 contest would come down to "a race of hope against fear."
"It's going to be about the courage to seize the future or whether we just stand with what we've got for four more years and hope we decline more slowly," he said. "I'm tired of seeing children grow up with the prospect of doing worse than their parents."
Actually, Mr. Clinton argued, the future could hardly be brighter in many ways, if only the nation would look beyond despair toward good things that have happened recently. He cited the end of the cold war, the decline of Communism and the tremendously diminished prospect of nuclear war between super powers.
"Just think," he said. "When we tell about all that, our grandchildren won't even know what we're talking about."
The Governor said that if the nation could mesh the interests and efforts of labor, business, education and government, it would be able to "handle" its opportunities.
"There's nothing we can't do," he fairly shouted.
Mr. Clinton's address to the Democratic gathering was something of a nostalgic homecoming for him. He was visibly moved by the tumultuous cheer that greeted his arrival.
"It brought tears to my eyes," he said when quiet returned to the auditorium where he was speaking. "Most of what I know I learned from you. I have done my best to honor the traditions that I learned here in this campaign for President."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
Florida Relief Effort Prefers Money to Goods

 BODY:
In the wake of Hurricane Andrew, southern Florida has been swept by another kind of deluge: cars, trucks and vans packed with goods for the storm victims and with people volunteering their services.
Fraternity brothers from South Carolina drove trucks full of canned goods to the Miami area. A paper company sent 20 tons of toilet paper, tissues and paper towels. A beer company sent aluminum cans full of water. 
 But relief organizers in Florida and in national headquarters say that grateful as they are for the flood of donations, they would rather have cash donations. They say the infusion of money is a boon to the hard-hit economy, and transportation and storage costs often make the donations of goods impractical.
"People hear that they have not eaten in a couple of days and want to send packages of food," said Larry Mackler, a spokesman for the Red Cross in New York. "But that is a costly procedure, you have to think of storing and shipping."
 
Climate of Confusion
 The steady stream of deliveries continues, however, in a climate of confusion. Rae Patterson, an assistant director of the Seventh-Day Adventists' charity effort, said that on some days the organization has been asked to send faxes authorizing donors to make deliveries in order to get past the Florida Highway Patrol, which is stopping many trucks entering the state because of packed highways.
"But then we heard that they don't need a fax," she went on.
Mrs. Patterson said her organization was using a church in Fort Lauderdale to insure that every truck arriving has a site from which to distribute goods with volunteers ready to unload the trucks. A volunteer worker said trucks came through yesterday carrying water, canned food, diapers and tents and mattresses.
The general secretary for the Florida branch of the Salvation Army yesterday described how the Florida Highway Patrol was stopping trucks and vans to check whether they had proper paperwork for interstate travel and sending them back if they did not.
The Salvation Army official, Lieut. Col. Doris M. Fizer, said her office in Tampa received frantic calls from donors who lacked a written destination for their deliveries.
Colonel Fizer said: "The trucks can't get through, the highways are jammed. The highway patrol have been calling asking what proof they have that they are making deliveries and ask if we are expecting them. We tell them 'yes.' "

HEADLINE: Turkey Puts on a New Face and Sidles Up to Europe More Coyly

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey

 BODY:
Across the long decades of the cold war, this vast land, composed of a sliver of Europe and a slab of Asia, knew exactly where it stood.
As East confronted West, Turkey was the last outpost on the frozen Anatolian steppe; it offered the United States air bases and missile installations, and it guarded the long southeastern flank facing the Soviet Union. It was a loyal and doughty member of the Western alliance that might one day aspire to full acceptance among those its huge army and outmoded tanks were supposed to protect. 
 These days the calculations have changed and Turkey is quietly seeking to redefine its relationship with the Western world, acknowledging that the long hoped-for peace dividend of membership in the European Community seems as remote as ever because its members do not want it to join.
"There is a wind blowing over Turkey," a senior Foreign Ministry official said. "It is coming from Europe and blowing Turkey away from Europe."
 
The New Sales Promotion
 As they review the changes, Ankara's diplomats are seeking new ways to entice the United States and Western Europe.
Instead of offering a bulwark against Communism, they are promoting their land as influential and stable in a region of instability and Islamic fundamentalism that encompasses the new nations in Central Asia and the anti-Western governments of Iran and Iraq.
They are quietly scaling back Turkey's public clamor for integration into Europe -- Ankara's most fundamental goal for decades -- and seeking economic advance to support a longer-range bid for membership in the European Community.
"There's this feeling that Turkey's expectations have been lowered," an official said. "That is a tactic. Instead of knocking on Europe's door every day, we are saying, 'Let's do our homework on the economy.' "
The armed forces of 850,000 are to be modernized and trimmed to 500,000, offered more as a potential peacemaker than cannon fodder before a Soviet advance. Under United Nations auspices, for instance, Turkey says it wants to send peacekeeping troops to Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite the region's memories of occupation by Ankara's Ottoman forebears.
 
Host at Economic Conference
 And by casting itself as a role model of Western-looking, secular democracy to the new Central Asian republics, Turkey is seeking to enhance its value to the West Europeans, both as an integral part of their defenses and a land that offers far more than guns and soldiers.
Turkey sought to underscore its new regional profile by convening an 11-nation gathering in Istanbul this year that brought together leaders from as far apart as Albania and Russia in a declaration of intended economic cooperation in the Black Sea region. It also was host to the 47-nation Islamic Conference Organization at a gathering supposed to marshal Muslim support for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As much as ever, though, Turkey confronts a deep reluctance among many Europeans and some Americans to share its visions, a reluctance that officials, including President Turgut Ozal, ascribe to Western aversion to Turkey's Muslim culture: while the Ankara Government is unflinchingly secular, 99 percent of its 60 million people are Muslims.
Greece, Turkey's perennial adversary, is blocking any move toward closer integration with Europe until Turkey makes concessions on Cyprus. Both Greece and Turkey are under strong American pressure to advance the stalled dispute, which began with Turkey's invasion of the island in 1974.
 
At Loggerheads Over Kurds
 The European Community has told Ankara that it will have to wait in line behind other lands from both Western and Eastern Europe, and greatly improve its economic performance, before it can even hope for community membership.
While Turkey says it has an "enhanced strategic relationship" with the Bush Administration, the United States Congress is urging that more than $450 million in military aid grants to Turkey be made into credits that Ankara will have to pay for.
As Europe itself ponders its own future defense structures, Turkey fears it could be left on the sidelines. And, most important of all, on the key issues of human rights and the plight of the Kurds of northern Iraq and Turkey, Ankara is at loggerheads with some of those same Western powers it is seeking to court.
The latest Amnesty International report on Turkey accuses the police of routine torture of suspects. Turkish human rights groups have charged the security forces with gunning down scores of civilian demonstrators at a major Kurdish festival in southeastern Turkey on March 21. [More bloodshed followed in August when 50 hours of fighting between rebels and Government forces in the southeastern town of Sirnak sent thousands of people fleeing their homes.]
 
Iraq Is a Sticking Point
 Arguably, though, it is over the issue of how the West should handle Iraq that Ankara is most at variance with its allies.
At the start of the Persian Gulf crisis in August 1990, Turkey was one of the first Western coalition members to enforce sanctions against Baghdad, closing down the pipelines that carried a full half of Iraq's oil for export and that earned Turkey millions of dollars.
And last year Ankara agreed to permit American and British warplanes to fly from Incirlik air base in southeastern Turkey over northern Iraq as a deterrent to further Iraqi onslaughts against the Kurds.
But as tension with Baghdad mounted again this summer, Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel has made clear that his country would not assume the same high profile and would not permit allied warplanes to fly combat missions against Iraq from Turkish bases.
Turkey acknowledges that the allied flights may be preventing Iraqi attacks that would cause a further, unwelcome flood of Kurdish refugees into Turkey. But as the deterrence continues, the Kurds of northern Iraq seem to be taking advantage of the protection to advance toward a Kurdish mini-state, possibly setting an example for Turkey's own Kurdish minority, six million of whom live in southeastern Turkey.
 
War Grows More Vicious
 "The Turks fear that if there's such an entity in northern Iraq, there would be a similar pressure for a Kurdistan in Turkey," a Western diplomat said. Ankara is fighting an increasingly vicious war against separatist Kurdish insurgents in the southeast precisely to prevent that.
On some issues Ankara's interests are more closely aligned with those of Baghdad than those of the West: both want the economic benefit of reopening the oil pipeline; neither wants the region's Kurds to pursue their separatist visions. Ankara pointedly refused to recognize the administration set up by Kurds in northern Iraq earlier this year.
"If Turkey does not want an independent Kurdish state" in northern Iraq, a high official said, "there is no independent Kurdish state."

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Riot Anger Spills Into Competition for Jobs

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Hammers fell silent last week on the wooden frame of a new shopping center in riot-torn South-Central Los Angeles as workers paused to hear the angry shouts of a small group of intruders.
"You white guys won't give us black people a chance," Jake Bellamy, a member of the Black Carpenters Association, shouted at one of the foremen. "You aren't fair. You don't know nothing about fair. Black men can do this work, too. They need to do this work to give their children a better future. Is your child better than mine?" 
 Three days later, on Aug. 21, more than 100 protesters, including Mr. Bellamy, took over the work site in the latest of a series of demonstrations that have become a new outlet for the anger that erupted into rioting four months ago.
 
Desperate for Work
 The protesters say desperation over finding jobs was one underlying cause of the riots. They say the absence of black workers on some inner-city rebuilding projects is a harsh reminder that these problems have not been resolved.
"It seems to me that the substance of the issue is that, void of buildings burning and ashes smoldering, people really are going back to business as usual," said Danny Bakewell, the leader of a black group called the Brotherhood Crusade.
"We are saying to the people operating in our community, 'You have an obligation and a responsibility to hire the people who live here,' " added Mr. Bakewell, who has organized a number of the demonstrations.
 
Changing Neighborhoods
 But the demographics of South-Central Los Angeles have been shifting rapidly, and the area, traditionally black, is now home to an equal number of Hispanic residents. The work-site demonstrations have aroused new tensions in neighborhoods where competition between black and Hispanic residents for shrinking jobs and services has been increasing sharply.
Hispanic workers were among the crews at some of the projects singled out by the protesters, and some Hispanic leaders have spoken out against Mr. Bakewell's work-site protests. One militant group has threatened to lead counterdemonstrations, arguing that the black-jobs campaign threatens the employment of Hispanic construction workers.
The demonstrations have persuaded some employers to hire black workers, and they have reminded others in the area of the need to integrate their construction crews.
But the roots of the anger run deeper, tapping still-unresolved social problems.
 
'People Are Still Angry'
 "I want to say to you that the riots didn't stop because the rage had ended," said Rodney White, a leader of the Black Carpenters Association, a small private group that was formed to protest a shortage of blacks in construction trade unions. "They stopped because of the National Guard. But the people are still angry down here, very angry, and I'm talking specifically about black males."
At the corner of Florence and Normandie Avenues, where the first serious violence of the riots broke out and where another demonstration this month shut down the rebuilding of a burned-out gasoline station, idle young black men talk angrily about a society that seems to have quickly forgotten their problems.
"The riot is over, and it's back to business as usual: nothing for us to do," said a shirtless young man who displayed across his back the tattoos of the 8-Trey Gangster Crips, a violent street gang. "All I can say is, next time it's going to be worse."
The work-site protests, which include both gang members and men in suits and neckties, have been mostly peaceful, though some violence and vandalism has been reported.
 
Problems Deeply Rooted
 On the site singled out by the black carpenters group, the general contractor, George Inouye, said: "I've been in this business for a number of years, and I do understand the problems that they have. But when people like this come up and scream and yell at me, it's difficult for me to know just what they want."
The economic and racial problems here are so deep that the composition of work crews can amount to little more than a symbol, said James Johnson, director of the Center for the Study of Urban Poverty at the University of California at Los Angeles.
"The seeds of the rebellion are inherent in the restructured economy and the massive job loss between 1978 and 1989, when about 200,000 jobs disappeared from the Los Angeles economy, most of them centered in South-Central Los Angeles," he said in an interview.
"These were high-paying, highly unionized jobs in manufacturing, jobs that were the lifeblood of the communities in South-Central Los Angeles, providing stable employment and livable wages that allowed people to maintain stable families," he said.
 
'The Lethal Combination'
 With the jobs gone and families disintegrating, and with the school system registering an inner-city dropout rate between 60 and 80 percent, Mr. Johnson said, "What you have in South-Central Los Angeles is a large population of mostly males who are neither at work nor in school, and that is the lethal combination."
And with the rapid influx of Hispanic residents into the area, he said, "What is happening is that you find blacks and Latinos competing for resources off the same dry bone."
As their population in South-Central Los Angeles approachs 50 percent, Hispanic residents have claimed a larger share of affirmative-action jobs and have sought a Hispanic balance in reapportionments of city, county and school districts.
They fought for more jobs at Martin Luther King Hospital, which was built after the Watts riot of 1965 to address black needs, and they raised loud complaints when no Hispanic candidates were included in the final selection for a new Los Angeles police chief.
 
Growing Urban Underclass
 The competition has been heightened as various groups, including a newly militant Korean community, have jostled for their share of reconstruction aid and jobs after the riot.
"We can't accept that the city continues to act as if immigrants aren't here," said City Councilman Mike Hernandez at a recent public forum, arguing for more Hispanic representation in rebuilding plans. "They're creating and perpetuating an underclass."
Sergio Munoz, news director of the Spanish-language KMEX television channel, called the workplace demonstrations an act of provocation and said, "Of course there is competition for jobs. We are all here legally, and so we should compete for the jobs. What I see wrong is when some leaders try to take advantage of this to pit one community against the other."
Some Hispanic leaders, like Nick Sandoval, president of the Hispanic Contractors Association, are seeking to calm the post-riot competition, saying it feeds already volatile tensions.
"We are all professionals. We want to share the pie," he said. "We want to go by our percentages and have parity."
But even this approach angers some blacks who see their share of the pie dwindling.
"They seem to feel that the Hispanic population is so large now that a few of us need to come off the scene and make room for them," said Nareshimah Osei, who led the shutdown of the work site at Florence and Normandie Avenues.
But with the riot, he said, "The door has been kicked open for those of us who are willing to stand up and fight for our community."

HEADLINE: China Frets as U.S. Mulls Taiwan Jet-Fighter Deal

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 29

 BODY:
The Chinese Government is worried that the United States and France may soon sell fighter planes to Taiwan, but is finding itself with little maneuvering room to block the sales, according to Chinese and foreign officials and scholars.
Officials in the Bush Administration have said that the President is leaning toward approving a proposed $4 billion sale of about 150 F-16's to Taiwan, a move that would save thousands of American jobs. 
 France must decide whether to sell Mirage 2000-5 fighters to Taiwan, a move that would also help keep production going and save jobs in hard economic times.
For Taiwan, which has been trying desperately for years to buy modern fighter planes, the prospect of having a choice would have been considered unimaginable just a year or two ago. But for China, which regards Taiwan as part of its territory and until now has successfully pressed Western countries to curb military sales to Taiwan, the proposed deals suggest an alarming trend.
Trade between Taiwan and China is soaring and relations are warming. But because Beijing refuses to renounce the use of force to "recover" Taiwan, the Taiwanese Government argues that it needs modern jet fighters to balance the Chinese Air Force, now strengthened by two dozen SU-27's purchased last year from Russia.
In the past, Chinese leaders reacted very strongly to block sales by Western countries to Taiwan, even lowering the status of its diplomatic relations with the Netherlands from an ambassadorial level in the early 1980's after it sold submarines to Taipei. But the Beijing Government appears to have less leverage now.
Many experts say that China understands the difficulties faced by President Bush in his re-election campaign and will be restrained in its reaction if he approves the F-16 sale after a review now under way.
"If the Bush Administration says: 'We have to do this. You know the best friend you've got in the world is Bush, and the best approach to take is a low-key one,' I think that would get some resonance here," said one American official, who insisted on not being identified.
In the past, the pressure to sell weapons to Taiwan came primarily from those who sympathized with its Government and its claims to represent all of China.
But these days the pressure is mainly economic: Taiwan, with more than $80 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, wants to buy weapons at a time when the military industry in many countries is shrinking.
Taiwan is also parceling out billions of dollars in domestic projects in the coming years, and it is likely to reward those countries that also sell weapons.
Although China also offers business opportunities to Americans, the jet sale to Taiwan, by directly saving jobs, could contribute to Mr. Bush's re-election chances.
China has warned France several times against selling the Mirage jets to Taiwan, and a Chinese buying mission recently boycotted France, but the threats have not been particularly harsh. Its tactics toward Washington has been even milder.
"China, of course, is paying attention to this, and it opposes the deal," said a senior Chinese official, in a reference to the proposed American sale. "At the least, China would express its objection.
But he said, "If you sell, there's nothing we can do."
Some American analysts say that China must take particular care in reacting to any deal because it faces a yearly vote in Congress over renewal of its favorable trade status.
Asked what China's response to a sale would be, the Foreign Ministry said the United States should "implement in a practical way the obligations" undertaken in the joint communiques between the countries.
What the Chinese are suggesting is that the sale could violate a communique issued by the United States and China in 1982 that says American arms sales to Taiwan should not exceed "either in qualitative or in quantitatve terms" the level of arms supplied in the previous four years.

HEADLINE: Voices of Hunts Point Talk of Drugs and Decay, but Rebirth Too Voices of Hunts Point Talk of Drugs and Decay, but Reality Too

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
On the streets of Hunts Point, young men and women, aimless and bored, hang out in front of storefronts covered with graffiti, abandoned buildings and vacant lots. Dealers brazenly sell drugs, paying children 5 cents to collect used crack vials. A guard at the McDonald's on Garrison Avenue tries to keep prostitutes from using the bathrooms as shooting galleries.
On other streets, children play stickball late into the evening as their parents linger on the sidewalks and stoops to escape hot, humid apartments. A woman on Bryant Avenue grows tomatoes and peppers in her front yard. Government officials from France tour the neat rows of new town houses bearing plaques trumpeting the day they opened. 
 These are the two worlds of Hunts Point in the Bronx -- two conflicting realities that collided early Wednesday morning in a bloody barrage of bullets on Longwood Avenue that wounded 12 people but, miraculously, killed no one.
The shooting, which the police said appeared to involve rival drug gangs trying to expand their turf, underscored the competing visions of a neighborhood, like others in New York City, on the cusp of a rebirth after the urban devastation of the 1970's and 1980's.
"You have stable micro-neighborhoods living next to a war zone," said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "How do you resolve this is the great question."
In more than two dozen interviews since the shootout, men and women, young and old, spoke of their different versions of Hunts Point, what is wrong and what would make it better. They spoke of their lives and their families, of fear and despair, of devotion to the neighborhood and hope for its future.
 
Jose Suares
Store Worker, 21 years old
Michael Santiago
Unemployed, 21 years old
 At the corner of Lafayette and Bryant Avenues, a spot that neighbors say is full of drug dealing, Jose Suares and Michael Santiago pointed proudly to a poem they helped spray-paint on the wall of a bodega:
Never forget!
What we may do is wrong, but it is a way of life!
We are forced to survive by any means necessary!
Why?
Because we're just products of our environment.
Created by the getto, born in the getto, also taught in the getto.
All we really are is victims of the getto!!!
"We've memorized it," Mr. Santiago said. "It tells it like it is."
The poem was written by a friend, they said. When they first heard it, they insisted on enshrining it on the wall in an elaborate mural. Next to the poem is a brief "R.I.P." for a friend, Charlie, who was shot to death on the corner last summer. Other friends are memorialized on other blocks of Hunts Point.
Mr. Suares and Mr. Santiago grew up in Hunts Point. They say that they have spent most of the summer hanging out late into the night on this and other corners. Mr. Suares said he has a job that pays $5 an hour at a clothing store. Mr. Santiago is unemployed. Both dropped out of high school. Asked about their plans for the future, both shrugged.
On Thursday night, cars drove by and their passengers called out to friends and others loitering on the corner. Prostitutes sauntered past.
Mr. Suares: "The shooting the other night -- that was typical. I've been here all my life, and it's always been the same."
Mr. Santiago: "That's everyday life here. Stick around here a little longer and you'll hear the gun shots."
Mr. Suares: "There's nothing that can be done about it. Kids grow up and they see everything going on. No one grows up and becomes a drug dealer because they were born with it. They see other people who are getting paid lots of money, and they want to get paid too."
Mr. Santiago: "It's a chain of events. You come and see a 16-year-old guy driving a 300z, a Benz or a Beamer, you want one too. You go to the streets because you make your money faster.
"And you do it for fame. It impresses the girls."

HEADLINE: Fort Dix May Become Federal Prison

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

 BODY:
The Pentagon and the United States Bureau of Prisons are close to an agreement to convert Fort Dix, the sprawling Army base in central New Jersey that has been stripped of its function as an active duty training center, into the largest prison in the Federal system.
The plan calls for five empty barracks to be converted, by early 1994, to a low security prison complex for 3,200 convicted drug offenders and white-collar criminals, Daniel R. Dunne, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, said in a telephone interview yesterday. The prison would be larger than any of the Government's 67 other prisons, he said. 
 He estimated that the conversion would provide 500 to 700 permanent new jobs to help soften the economic blow of the Army's retrenchment at the 75-year-old base in Burlington County. Nearly 4,000 civilians worked at Fort Dix, one of the county's biggest employers, when the change in its military status was announced a year ago. About 3,100 of them have lost their jobs, leaving about 900 civilian jobs when active duty training ends next month, officials said.
A final agreement on the prison plan has not been reached, but there do not appear to be any major roadblocks, officials said.
 
Community Comment Sought
 "It's really a win-win-win situation for everyone involved," Mr. Dunne said. "It's an excellent opportunity for the taxpayers. We'd move into a facility that's already established. Both organizations see the importance and economic significance this has and are looking to make it work."
Mr. Dunne said a study of the environmental and economic impact of the proposed prison was completed early this summer. Military and prison officials are soliciting reactions to the proposal from local officials and residents in Wrightstown, Pemberton Township and other communities around Fort Dix.
The 30-day period for gathering comment ends on Sept. 7. Afterward, Defense Department and military officials will begin a final review of the plan, Mr. Dunne said.
So far no strong objections have been raised.
 
'It Sounds Good'
 "There's been no groundswell of opposition," said Paul Tuliano, a former member of Pemberton Township's zoning board who has been long active in the community's civic affairs. "Economically, it sounds good."
Mr. Tuliano noted that New Jersey created a state prison at other existing buildings at Fort Dix in the early 1980's and that local officials have routinely favored renewing the lease for that prison.
Last month, the township council in Pemberton Township wrote to the Bureau of Prisons in support ofthe proposed prison and the jobs it would generate, Harold Morin, a council member, said yesterday.
"The people going into it aren't going to be any worse than those in the state prison," Mr. Morin said. "The state prisoners are killers, rapists, everything."
Inmates in low-security prisons are "normally not people who have a history of violence or serious offenses," Mr. Dunne said. Their average sentence is five years, he said. Sixty-four percent of low-security inmates are in a Federal prison for the first time and 67 percent were convicted of drug-related offenses, he said.
The Fort Dix prison, he said, would be surrounded by two 12-foot high chain-link fences separated by coils of razor wire. Each fence would also be topped by the wire coils.The prison would comprise about 209 of the base's 31,065 acres, a few blocks from its main jogging track.
Mr. Dunne said the proposed prison is part of an "extensive expansion" planned by the prison bureau. Its 67 prisons house 71,000 inmates, 44 percent above capacity, and the number of inmates is expected to increase to 100,000 by 1995, he said.
Currently the largest Federal prison, in Atlanta, has about 2,140 prisoners.
 
Economic Impact of Millions
 For months, Government officials, including United States Representative H. James Saxton, whose district includes Fort Dix, have been scrambling for ways to ease the local economic impact of the Army's cutbacks at the base.
Under a nationwide military consolidation plan announced in July 1991 by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, Fort Dix's historic mission -- training regular Army troops -- is to end on Sept. 30. On Aug. 21, the final 600 recruits of the 3 million trained at the base since it opened in 1917 graduated from boot camp.
Post commanders are now preparing for the base's new role as a base for weekend and summer training of National Guard and Army Reserve units.
The retrenchment will mean a loss in annual earnings of about $125 million, according to a 1991 study by Burlington County's Department of Economic Development. That figure includes the salaries of the dismissed civilian workers at the base, as well as of employees of the base's suppliers who lost their jobs.
A new prison employing 500 to 700 would make up a fraction of the loss. Mr. Dunne, the spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, said that the annual payroll for the prison that is planned would be $17.8 million. The prison's estimated annual operating budget will be $25.2 million, including about $7.2 million for food, supplies, electricity, water and other utilities.
Of the 500 to 700 new jobs, Mr. Dunne said, 200 to 280 will go to members of the bureau's staff around the county and 300 to 400 would be newly created clerical, administrative, medical, food service, and maintenance positions.
The proposed prison is expected to cost from $5 million to $10 million, considerably less than a new facility. A new low-security prison with 700 beds, less thanone-fourth the size of the one planned, would cost about $50 million, Mr. Dunne said.
Some of the lower cost stems from the planned use of existing medical buildings, gymnasiums and mess halls near the converted barracks.
About 70 percent of the construction cost will be spent on labor and the other 30 percent for materials, Mr. Dunne said. Local companies will be allowed to bid on the project.
The proposed prison would be the Federal system's first low-security facility on a military base and the first in the Northeast.
There are minimum-security prisons, which do not have perimeter fencing, at Seymour-Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, and Eglin and Homestead Air Force Bases in Florida. The inmates at Homestead were transferred to other Federal prisons before Hurricane Andrew struck the base last week, causing extensive damage.

HEADLINE: California Senate Reluctantly Passes Grim Budget

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug. 29

 BODY:
The two-month-long budget crisis in California took a large step toward conclusion early this morning when the State Senate reluctantly passed an austere recession-era budget that cuts deeply into health and welfare services and state support for cities and counties.
The bill, which closely resembles the no-new-taxes plan proposed by the Republican Governor, Pete Wilson, now goes to the fractious State Assembly, where its fate is uncertain. But with the Democratic-controlled Senate having passed it by a solid 33-to-5 vote, the Assembly has been put in the difficult position of either yielding to the Governor or plunging the state still deeper into crisis. 
 Unable to bridge a $10.7 billion budget gap, the state has been paying its bills with i.o.u.'s since July 1, and centers for the retarded and many health programs for the poor and old are on the verge of shutting. Schools are set to reopen in another week or so amid huge uncertainty about how much money they will have.
 
A Few Concessions
 The Senate action came at 1:30 this morning after days of intense negotiations during which Senate leaders extracted a few concessions from Governor Wilson to make the budget a little more palatable to the Assembly. For example, Mr. Wilson agreed to drop his demand to eliminate adult dental care for the poor under the state's Medi-Cal program and to cut welfare grants by 5.8 percent instead of 10 percent.
Still, the President pro tem of the Senate, David A. Roberti, a Los Angeles Democrat, said, the budget was a harsh one for a state that is suffering through a "great recession, almost depression."
It would cut $1.3 billion from the $2.9 billion that the state would have normally given to cities, counties and special fire-fighting and other districts; reduce money for regional centers for the retarded; limit Medi-Cal eligibility for nonresidents; cut support for the University of California and the California State University systems by $402 million; double fees at community colleges, and delay the opening of two new prisons.
And, most controversially, the budget would maintain support for public schools, kindergarten through 12th grade, but only with complex bookkeeping acrobatics devised by Governor Wilson that "recapture" $1.1 billion in excess money paid to schools last year and then "lend" them money from future years for this year.
Under the budget passed by the Senate, the schools would have to repay the money in better times unless revenues are insufficient to maintain per-pupil spending. This measure is bitterly opposed by the education establishment and the powerful Speaker of the Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr., a San Francisco Democrat, and will be the main focus of debate in the Assembly.
 
'We Have No Choice'
 Senator after Senator rose last night to decry the proposed budget as "anathema," "horrible" and "lousy," but then voted for it in glum resignation.
"We must act; we have no choice but to act," said Senator Roberti, adding later, "It is long since the time when the public will tolerate a philosophical fight between Republicans and Democrats."
One of the few Senators to vote against the bill was Diane E. Watson, a Democrat who represents the South-Central Los Angeles area torn by riots in late April and early May. "We should stand up to the Governor," she said. "He is a mean-spirited guy."
Reflecting the views of many liberal Democrats, Ms. Watson said that the Governor did not really want a budget passed and hoped that the resulting chaos would help him win voter approval of a measure he has put on the November ballot that would enhance his powers over the budget.
An extraordinarily raucous debate is likely in the Assembly. Under the State Constitution, the budget must obtain a two-thirds vote in both houses, possible in the genteel Senate but extremely difficult on the 80-seat Assembly, which has 47 Democrats and 33 Republicans and where it is unclear whether the Governor is more disliked by his fellow Republicans than by Democrats. The budget must obtain 54 votes to pass.
Voting was not expected until Sunday or Monday, when the session officially ends.
On Friday afternoon, Speaker Brown denounced the education part of the package, likening it to "skimming in Las Vegas."
The Governor has said he would veto any budget that raises taxes or rolls over obligations into future years. But if his Senate-amended budget passes, it would mean many new fees for Californians and almost certainly higher taxes as local governments try to replace lost state subventions.

HEADLINE: Trenton G.O.P. Shifting School Aid to Suburbs

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
After abandoning a plan to amend the State Constitution to cut the underpinnings from a law set up to funnel aid to the state's urban schools, the Republican legislative majority is now preparing to shift money back to suburban districts.
Administration officials agree that something must be done to revise the Quality Education Act, acknowledging that a drop in tax revenues and the strict guidelines of the current aid formula could hurt suburban districts. At the same time they are concerned that the courts might not agree with changes that would slow down a long-term court-ordered plan: to bring school spending in poorer districts closer to that of wealthier districts. 
 "Obviously we are going to have to have an adjustment to the formula, but we want to insure that it is equitable and fair," said Education Commissioner John Ellis.
Thomas Corcoran, the Governor's policy adviser for education, said, "You want to avoid a situation such as occurred in Texas, where the courts took charge of the allocation of state aid to schools," appointing a special master after the legislature was unable to agree on a plan.
 
Courts Are Not Veto-Proof
 Republicans have been at odds with Mr. Florio, Mr. Ellis and the Democrats over the school aid formula ever since it was approved two years ago. Now that they have veto-proof two-thirds majorities in both houses, they can enact whatever legislation they want.
But cuts in the original aid package made by the Democrats because of budget problems are already being challenged in court, and any further reductions are also likely to face a legal challenge.
State Senator John H. Ewing of Bernardsville and Assemblyman John A. Rocco of Cherry Hill, the Republicans who are chairmen of the Senate and Assembly Education Committees, served notice this week that drastic revisions were in store, arguing that middle-class districts would be placed in "educational jeopardy" if nothing is done.
"New Jersey is faced with an unnacceptable choice if we leave the Q.E.A. intact," Mr. Ewing said. "Either middle-class districts will lose $234 million, or the state must raise taxes for school aid."
Either choice, he said, is "unacceptable."
 
'Virtually Meaningless'
 Governor Florio called the aid projections, which the Republicans derived from figures given by the bipartisan Office of Legislative Services, "virtually meaningless," saying that"income growth and property values, especially in these volatile economic times, are impossible to determine so far in advance."
Although the Republican leaders said in a statement that they would "endeavor to insure that there are no losers," any revision in the aid formula seems likely to shift money away from poorer districts, unless more money is found to help the schools.
But urban districts would not get less money than they do now; rather the projected increase, now $205 million, would be reduced. The Republicans said they would release specifics of their plan in September, then seek reaction before introducing a bill.
School financing has been a contentious issue in the state since 1990, when Mr. Florio persuaded the Legislature to increase the state income tax, partly in anticipation of court action on school aid.
 
Aid to Poor Cities Required
 As the Governor expected, the State Supreme Court ruled that year in a long-pending case called Abbott v. Burke that the state had to revise its aid formula to pump more money into 30 districts like Newark, Paterson, Jersey City, Hoboken and others that had substantial poor and minority populations, as well as relatively low incomes and property tax bases.
The Quality Education Act was designed to revise the formula, increasing state aid to those special needs districts each year until the districts reach parity in spending with others in the state.
Of a $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990, $1.1 billion was earmarked for education. But the overall tax increase was the decisive factor in the overwhelming defeat of the Democratic Legislature last November.
The Republicans promptly repealed $608 million of the tax increase by rolling back the 1-cent increase in the sales tax imposed by the Democrats. None of that money was intended for education, which is financed by the income tax, but the action coincided with hard economic times that have hurt tax collections of all kinds.
"The problem is the recession," said Mr. Corcoran. "There is just less revenue than we expected."
 
Taking From Urban Schools
 Compounding that is the differing political realities of Republican and Democratic legislators. Republicans mostly represent more affluent suburban districts, while the Democrats tend to come from urban areas, with bigger school problems and less wealth. So even before the revenue picture grew quite so dark, the Republicans complained that too much money was being spent -- some said "wasted" -- on the urban schools.
The Democrats note that the courts ordered more spending in poor districts. They add that it costs more to educate inner-city children with more social problems.
Last year, the Florio Administration managed to quiet outcries from the Republicans and the more affluent and middle-income school boards by adding $342 million to the school aid package through a revision in the state pension system.
Republicans nonetheless continue to chafe under the school aid formula, and even went so far as to propose an amendment to the State Constitution that would have struck down a provision mandating the state to provide "thorough and efficient education" to all its children.
It was that clause that the State Supreme Court used in ruling in 1990 that the state had to provide more money to poorer districts to bring them closer in spending to the wealthier ones.
Now the Republican majority has abandoned the effort to amend the constitution, at least for this year, partly because an attack on the words "thorough and efficient" seemed to many critics like an attack on educational quality. Instead, they have decided to work on revising the education act itself.

HEADLINE: Minority-Contract Rules Raise Issue of How to Measure Discrimination

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
In 1990, just a year after making record sales, Bill Howell's Brooklyn-based oil company was cutting staff and costs to stay afloat. Certainly the recession hurt, but to Mr. Howell, the culprit was something less tangible, if more insidious: discrimination.
Arousing his suspicions was the timing of his financial downturn. In July 1990, New York State suspended a program that gave preferences to minorities and women bidding on state contracts. Without the program, Mr. Howell, who is black, lost out on bids for $300,000 in state business -- almost half the annual sales of Howell Petroleum Products. 
 "No one gave us a reason, but I knew," he said. "They no longer had to buy from minorities. So they didn't."
On the battlefield over affirmative action, both sides can claim backing from Mr. Howell's story. To supporters of preference programs, it demonstrates why governments should set aside a percentage of their contracts for minorities and women. To critics, it only shows that Mr. Howell could not compete in the open market.
 
Two Studies, One Result
 In recent months, both New York State and New York City have issued studies of the share of government contracts received by women and minorities. In both, minorities and women represented 25 percent of the qualified contract bidders, but received less than 8 percent of the public money spent in a given year.
Based on its study, the city began a program last month intended to insure that up to 20 percent of its spending goes to businesses owned or controlled by minorities or women. And earlier this month, after releasing its own four-volume study, the state announced that it would restore a similar program it had suspended in 1990 after a United States Supreme Court ruling struck down a minority preference program in Richmond.
The studies are important because they apparently hold the key to whether minority preference programs will pass muster with the courts. In essence, in the Richmond ruling in 1989, the Supreme Court said that state and local governments could operate preference programs -- if they demonstrated "with some specificity" the existence of discrimination.
But to critics of such programs, the studies are fraught with inaccuracies, weak analyses and questionable methodologies. Though they may demonstrate barriers against women and minorities, the critics say, they do not necessarily prove that discrimination has occurred. Opponents have vowed to challenge the state and city programs in court.
 
A Matter of Proof
 At stake are hundreds of millions in public dollars for contracts ranging from paper clips to road signs to prison construction.
The debate over the studies cuts to a deeper question: how can a government actually prove the existence of widespread discrimination?
"The nature of discrimination is such that there is not going to be a lot of documentation of what happened," said Franklin M. Lee, chief counsel with the Minority Business Legal Defense Fund in Washington. "There's not going to be a corpse where you can see the crime has been committed."
Such a question has confronted scores of governments and public agencies since the Court ruled in Richmond v. J. A. Croson.
Since the decision, which did not affect Federal set-aside programs, as many as 236 race- or gender-based preference programs across the country have been suspended or substantially altered, according to the Minority Business Defense Fund. And more than 80 studies have been conducted providing statistical ammunition to defend the programs.
New York State's study cost $360,000; New York City's $300,000.
 
Political Issues Raised
 Underlying the debate are broader political issues concerning the emerging role of immigrants and minorities in city governments. For Mayor David N. Dinkins, who in his election campaign in 1989 promised to give more city contracts to minorities, the issue could come full circle: Rudolph W. Giuliani has promised to attack the city's set-aside program in next year's campaign.
"In a city that is trying to save money to help the poor, we are going to pay 10 percent more to do this," Mr. Giuliani said. "We are creating social friction that is race based."
Dinkins administration officials say their program is merely trying to address long-standing discrimination by leveling the playing field.
Across the country, at least 16 challenges to state or local preference programs -- most brought by white-owned construction companies -- are wending their way through courts. In New York State, two contractors have asked the courts to reinstate suits that were dismissed when the state's minority-preference program was suspended.
City and state officials say their preference programs differ from those of the past in that they set flexible goals, not rigid quotas, although critics question whether there is any difference.
 
Minority Concerns Favored
 Under the state program, contractors who pledge to give a certain -- as yet undetermined -- percentage of work to minority or women subcontractors will be favored. Those who fail to meet their goals could lose contracts, said Lynn Canton, director of the state's division of minority and women's business development.
The city program allows department heads to award contracts to minority and women-owned firms whose bids are up to 10 percent higher than the lowest bids from white-owned firms. In some cases, agency heads can limit bidding only to firms owned by women or minorities.
New York State spends about $7 billion each year for all of its goods and services, and New York City about $2.5 billion, so even a small percentage change in the contracts awarded to minorities and women will translate into millions of dollars.
 
Vigilance Against Fraud
 Before a company can qualify for the programs, it must submit for review by the city or state about a dozen documents showing that minorities or women own or control 51 percent of it.
But officials concede that preventing fraud can be difficult. Past set-aside programs were plagued by scandals in which minority companies were actually fronts for white executives. Since then, New York State has toughened its certification process, said Joseph A. Spinelli, the State Inspector General.
The state has prosecuted two cases of fraud in such programs since 1988. In both, the defendants pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of filing false documents and served no jail time.
At the heart of the criticism of the discrimination studies that are being used to justify minority preference programs is the fact that most do not account for factors other than discrimination in explaining why companies owned by women and minorities do not fare well in obtaining government contracts.
Studies that do not compare companies of the same size and age are skewed, they contend.
"A company with 50 employees will not be able to perform on a $500 million contract as well as one with 500 employees," said Michael Kennedy, special counsel to the Association of General Contractors of America, which represents 32,000 construction contractors nationwide.
 
Response to Criticisms
 Critics also question the studies' use of anecdotal information.
"There are generalizations made about government officials or bonding agencies or banks, but there are rarely specifics," said George R. LaNoue, an economist at the University of Maryland who has testified in court cases involving minority preference programs.
Authors of the studies have answers to these criticisms.
Dr. David S. Evans of the National Economic Research Associates, who directed New York City's study, said many companies owned by minorities and women were smaller and younger than their white-owned counterparts precisely because of discrimination. Accounting for the size or age of companies in his study would have "contaminated it with the very thing we want to measure: discrimination," he said.
Mr. Lee of the Minority Business Legal Defense and Education Fund said that while anecdotal information could be unreliable, it should be taken seriously when stories consistently pointed in one direction.
"If there wasn't discrimination, how do you account for the broad cross section who say the same things?" he said.

HEADLINE: Conductor-Sleuths Nose Out Bogus Rail Tickets

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
Fred T. may look like any other conductor on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, but he has a special undercover assignment: catching counterfeiters.
Usually, he can tell a bogus ticket by touch alone.
In the last few months, he has caught an advertising executive, a civilian employee of the Coast Guard and most recently "a very high-priced lawyer." 
 "There's some sophisticated equipment out there, a laser copier that does a very, very good job," said Fred T., who asked that his full name not be used to protect his undercover status.
Thanks to the advent of color copiers and a tight economy, Metro-North officials say, more people are trying their hand at counterfeiting tickets. So far this year, the railroad has arrested 10 people, compared with nine people in all of 1991, said Inspector John Lynch of the Metro-North police.
 
Stakes Are High
 Railroad officials estimate that fewer than 1 percent of the line's 100,000 riders may be using counterfeit tickets. But with a monthly pass running as much as $200, the stakes for the railroad are high.
One of the major tools against counterfeiting is "punch day," when a conductor punches a hole in tickets after closely examining them. Punch days are becoming increasingly frequent on Metro-North, officials said.
Special conductors like Fred T. are trained to catch even the most sophisticated forgery, running the tickets between their fingers and holding them up to the light.
When counterfeiters are found, they are usually arrested by the Metro-North police at the next stop. The excuses are usually familiar ones. "They say, 'I got it from a friend' or 'I bought it while I was standing in line for my ticket,' " Inspector Lynch said.
 
Broke Up Small Ring
 Fred T. can take credit for breaking up a small counterfeiting ring.
He was grocery shopping with his wife and got a tip that someone was selling bogus tickets nearby at a bar in New Rochelle.
"A guy would go into the bar and the bartender'd say, 'Working in New York? How do you get in, the train? What do those commuter tickets cost now, $114?' " the conductor said.
Then the bartender would say he just happened to have a counterfeit ticket he could sell for $25. "And the guy'd leave another $25 at the bar," said the conductor.
The bartender was convicted of counterfeiting and served part of a one-year sentence. In New York, forging a ticket is a felony, while in Connecticut it is only a misdemeanor. Inspector Lynch said Metro-North is seeking legislation to make counterfeiting a felony in Connecticut as well.
 
Fewer Problems on L.I.R.R.
 Counterfeiting is a lesser problem on the Long Island Rail Road, which conducts five punch days a month. Sam Zambuto, a railroad spokesman, said two people were arrested for counterfeiting tickets last year, and one has been charged so far this year.
Metro-North commuters dashing off the train here said they found the more frequent checking of their tickets annoying, but most said they welcomed the punch days.
"Frankly, I'd prefer they check the tickets closely when I'm paying more than $200 a month for my ticket," said Lauren Williams of Milford, a manager of a computer company in Manhattan who commutes daily. "I don't want to hear a forger's riding for free."
Edward Ohms, Metro-North's assistant director of transit planning, said the railroad is trying to develop a ticket that will outsmart the forgers with their laser technology. In the meantime the railroad is relying on more spot checks.

Cone Gets To Toronto But Can't Find Plate

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Home is a hotel room, and so who knows where the heart is. There are moments when David Cone feels his in his throat. There are moments, infrequent but inescapable, when it is hard for him not to feel it in pieces.
"Shellshocked," Cone said of himself. 
 The trade, of course, was what had so irretrievably altered his universe. The trade, sudden and to his mind suspicious, that had sent the right-hander from the Mets to the Blue Jays last Thursday. The trade.
"Sadness is an emotion that is prevalent," said Cone. "The excitement can overwhelm it. Nevertheless, it's there."
The trade, though, had to give way to the game, and the game was always something David Cone could deal with. He'd blocked out scandal to pitch for the Mets. He'd closed his mind to demoralization to win for the Mets. He'd pitched on and on and now, the game was upon him.
"To pitch, to be thrown into the fire so soon, it's the best medicine," said Cone.
The game, though, proved to be an awful tough tonic. Cone, in his debut as the latest principal in Toronto's patented strong-arm tactics for prevailing in the American League East, was wild and erratic and consequently bludgeoned by the Brewers in a 7-2 defeat today. He wasn't a savior. He wasn't even as good as Chris Bosio.
Cone, his mind reeling from the shock of the trade but also in pursuit of a theory to rationalize it, arrived in Toronto Friday night and was assigned a locker in the club's space-age clubhouse. "It's like the Jetsons," said Cone.
The cartoon feel of the night lost its comic edge soon enough. The Brewers mauled the Blue Jays for 31 hits and 22 runs Friday night to pull within four and one-half games of Toronto.
"Didn't get scared off, did you?" Cone was asked by Bob Bailor, the first-base coach for the Blue Jays.
Not much scares Cone, but the right-hander had spent the first half of the marathon of runs and pitching embarrassments charting pitches. Toronto's pitching problems, the cause behind the effect of the trade for Cone, couldn't have been any more starkly dramatized. Jimmy Key, the night's starter who was icing his left shoulder afterward, suggested the long Brewer innings might have left Cone wanting to ice his wrist.
"Jack Morris took the chart away from me after the fourth," said Cone.
What was to be handed Cone, then, was as obvious as the Skydome. The Blue Jays, who will pay slightly less than $1 million for Cone's seven regular-season starts, want quality of the highest sort. Unable to shake the Orioles and Brewers, they were feeling the tremors of panic.
"Coming from where I came from, from the deadness, it's an electric opportunity," said Cone. "Deal with pressure, deal with a big game."
Not today, though. Cone's trademark pitches mutinied. He walked seven, three of whom scored, and he was nearly run over as the Brewers stole seven bases off him.
In perhaps his most painful stumble of the afternoon, Cone, who had given up three runs through five innings, promptly sabotaged the 3-2 game the Blue Jays had made of it with a Joe Carter two-run homer in the sixth. He walked the leadoff man in the seventh and two more before it was over, as the Brewers scored four runs to wrap up the game.
"I started to press in the seventh, and fell apart," Cone said. "It's unnerving. That's what I'm supposed to thrive on. But I'll get better. I'll help this club."
 
Staring at the Tracks
 But for the moment, Cone was left to return to his hotel room at Skydome, the one with the window that looks out on railroad tracks, the one he stares out of as he tries to trace his route to this spot. He was traded for a pair of prospects and with the explanation that it was all executed because of economics.
The Mets, the right-hander learned through the club's news conference transcript, figured the potential free agent would demand a deal of five years and that such a contract didn't figure in the organization's calculus of investment risk. Never mind that they never asked Cone what it would take for the All-Star and National League's strikeout leader to stay on.
"I haven't had time to put it all in perspective," said Cone. "I will always speak my mind, but I may hold my tongue for the moment. I do not want to sound like a scorned, tortured, traded athlete."
In his more vulnerable moments, though, that is what he feels like. He finds the club's "asumption" that he wouldn't sign for fewer than five years disingenuous. The appeal to him of a deal with a shorter term and inflated annual figures is and always has been real. His affection for New York and the Mets remained true to the end.
"Yes, I am paid an enormous amount of money, and, yes, trades are all part of the sport," said Cone. "But I felt like I extended myself to the utmost for the Mets, that I was willing to throw 166 pitches and put myself at risk for the Mets, and that I was let drop without so much as a phone call. Maybe it means nothing to anybody and maybe it shouldn't. But it's hard not to feel unappreciated."
 
Did Mets Bear a Grudge?
 The urge, then, to search for a conspiracy theory is hard to fight. Cone doesn't discount the notion that the club's executives have borne a grudge since Cone abruptly halted talks on a long-term deal with the Mets and went on to win his arbitration case against the club last spring.
"It was a heated case," said Cone. "I don't think they were prepared."
As a result, Cone believes, the Mets might have decided right then that he wouldn't be in their future plans, and that he was used accordingly in 1992.
"I'd joked with coaches all season that they were trying to wring everything out of me, and that I definitely must have been a goner," said Cone. "There was joking back, an awkward dialogue. And when they let me throw 166 pitches, that was the first time I saw the writing on the wall.
"Let me say this," said Cone, who threw 166 pitches in a 1-0 shutout of the Giants on July 17. "I wanted the baseball. If I'd wanted out of that game, I could have asked out. I take responsibility. But it's the manager's decision, too."
 
He Won't Issue Any Excuses
 And so there will be continued questions throughout Canada about the status of Cone's arm, especially after his outing today. Cone said he felt flat, but he attributed that largely to the fact that with the trade and the travel, he hadn't picked up a baseball since Tuesday. He said he had been aware that the Brewers ran, but wasn't prepared for how "all-out" their stealing was.
"But all the excuses," said Cone, "all of it goes out the window."
And for Cone, there is a certain healthy unburdening that has come with his closing the door on the Mets.
"There's relief, I suppose," he said. "And there is a tremendous opportunity for a great experience. There's possibility here, right now. I want to pitch a big game and begin to feel a part of it here."
Cone, with mixed emotions, is still waiting after today. Toronto, with crossed fingers, waits with him.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Free Agents May Find Many Closed Wallets

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The Mets' decision to trade David Cone rather than give him millions of dollars as a free agent did not come as a surprise to at least one general manager. Even while Al Harazin, the Mets' general manager, was saying a couple of weeks ago that he would not trade Cone, his counterpart on another team, during a discussion of the coming free-agent market, remarked, "The Mets may have more constraint because they're so awful this year."
Perhaps that general manager had greater insight into Harazin's thinking than Harazin himself. Whatever, by trading their best pitcher to the Toronto Blue Jays, the Mets have begun what can be considered the Cone constraint. 
 Except the Cone constraint could have ramifications well beyond the Mets, who want to reduce the $44.5 million payroll they have labored under this season. It certainly adds intrigue to what is expected to be the key question of the off season:
With the coming free-agent class potentially the most glamorous ever, are clubs prepared to spend the type of money to which top-flight free agents have become accustomed, or will some players suffer economic shock, discovering that the money they expected isn't there?
 
Plenty of Big Names
 Cone, Doug Drabek, Greg Maddux, John Smiley, Greg Swindell are the most attractive starting pitchers heading for free agency. The hitting part of the potential market includes Barry Bonds, Kirby Puckett, Mark McGwire, Ruben Sierra, Joe Carter and Paul Molitor.
As the salaries soar to superstratospheric levels, more teams drop out of the competition for the superstar types. With so many of those players available, then, will they find enough teams willing to spend the kind of money they seek? After all, how many Kirby Pucketts can one team sign?
"When there have been impact and premium players available, they have always been well-rewarded," Fred Claire, the Los Angeles Dodgers' general manager, said. "I don't know of any exception to that. Of course, we've never had as many potential impact players as far as I can recall."
Bobby Bonilla, who was the most attractive free agent available last winter even though his credentials fell short of some in this year's group, signed with the Mets for $29 million over five years, a record annual average income until the Chicago Cubs gave Ryne Sandberg $28.4 million for a four-year extension that prevented him from joining this year's free agents. Danny Tartabull signed with the Yankees for $25.5 million for five years.
 
Here Comes Reality
 Sandy Alderson, the Oakland Athletics' general manager, said he thought it was possible that some free agents might fall short of their quest for riches.
"I think that came close to reality last winter," Alderson said. "Danny Tartabull came very close not to being shut out but to being surprised by what was available until the Yankees bailed him out. This year, with the sheer number of free agents who will be available in the winter, given an additional year of fiscal evolution -- that is, expenses have risen to a level much closer to or beyond our revenues -- you're going to see some of that."
The San Diego Padres are one of those teams that does not plan to participate in the expensive sweepstakes. Bonds, who lives near San Diego, has expressed a desire to play there, but he would have to take maybe 50 cents on the dollar to interest the Padres.
"The number of teams that can afford them is diminishing," Joe McIlvaine, the Padres' general manager, said of the big-name free agents. "For a team like the Padres, it would be extremely difficult, almost impossible, to sign a player of that magnitude for the bucks they're talking about. We'd almost have to strip our team to pay for them."
Player agents are aware of the possibly shrinking market, but they remain confident that the top layer of free agents will go through the procedure economically unscathed. They aren't so certain about the players just below the top.
"I do have a feeling it will be tough for a lot of guys," said Chuck Berrty, Sierra's agent. "I think that will happen to a degree. There will be some who can get jobs at any level, but at what point does that number stop? Are there three, six, nine spots available? Somewhere down the ladder guys are going to be surprised."
Wade Boggs, whose string of successive .300 seasons is about to end at 10, is expected to be one of those who have a surprise awaiting them. One agent, not his, who always has a good read on the market, referred to Boggs as a player who "has become the quintessential mediocre third baseman." The tarnished Boston star, the agent said, "is going to find no one giving him $4 million a year and losing a draft choice."
Scott Boras, who represents Maddux and Benito Santiago, said he believed that some players having off years will adopt a different strategy.
"Players may decide to use salary arbitration," he said, "and go at it another year where there is less talent available, where there is a better market. I think that plan B will be utilized by a number of players if there is a question of the market. That could be a very viable alternative. If a club doesn't offer arbitration, he can sign wth someone for one year and be a free agent next year."
Tom Reich, an agent with years of free-agent experience, noted that the top pitchers won't have anything to fear. "The economic market is totally different for pitchers and everyday players," he said.
That's one of the reasons the Mets decided to trade Cone. Once the Cubs confirmed Reich's view by offering Maddux a five-year contract (for $27.5 million), Harazin concluded that someone might indeed offer Cone five years, but that it wasn't going to be the Mets. Harazin is not alone in his thinking about placing constraints on that type of offer.
"I was shocked when I read about the Maddux negotiations," the A's Alderson said. "My immediate reaction was the only thing dumber than making the offer was rejecting it."
 
The Skydome Is the Limit
 The David Cone trade carried with it another significant development.
In 1982, when the Yankees traded Tommy John to the California Angels on Aug. 31, the transfer of his salary on that day, when rosters are used to compile average team salaries, catapulted the Angels' average past the Yankees' figure, $423,403 to $411,988. That made the Angels No. 1 after the Yankees had held that spot the first four years the Players Association computed average team salaries.
Cone's move from New York to Toronto virtually assures the Blue Jays the No. 1 spot in this year's salary standing. Although Cone earned $3,362,637 of his salary with the Mets and will earn only $887,363 with the Blue Jays, the entire $4.25 million salary will be included in the Toronto total. That's the way labor and management salary practices work.
The roster changes created by the trade left the Blue Jays with an average salary of $1,517,272, the Mets $1,367,635.
 
An Ace, Without the Bandages
 If Mike Harkey's body ever lets him, he could become one of the best pitchers in the major leagues. The Chicago Cubs wait patiently, if with frustration.
After shoulder and knee injuries deprived him of a chance of pitching in the majors in 1989, Harkey had an outstanding rookie season in 1990, compiling a 12-6 record. An early-season shoulder injury led to surgery May 2 last season and limited him to four starts. The shoulder wasn't right this year, either, and he began the season on the 60-day disabled list.
But he finally was able to pitch again after the All-Star Game break, and he reeled off four victories without a loss and a 1.93 earned run average in his first six starts. It was no coincidence that the Cubs' resurgence occurred once Harkey joined the starting rotation.
The 25-year-old right-hander began a Cubs' four-game winning streak with his first victory, extended a winning streak to four games with his second, ended a four-game skid with his third and started a five-game winning streak with his fourth.
Harkey was scheduled to try to extend the Cub's streak to six last Tuesday, but he aggravated a groin pull he suffered in his previous start and couldn't pitch. The Cubs lost the game. They're grateful that this time they won't lose Harkey for long.

HEADLINE: Washington's Spin on Keiretsu

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Yoshi Tsurumi in "Don't Beat the Keiretsu. Join Them" (Forum, Aug. 2) describes Japanese keiretsu as benign groupings of companies helping each other in adversity and pooling resources to develop new businesses. Because some foreign companies sell to, or have joint ventures with, keiretsu members, he concludes that Americans should join keiretsu rather try to break them up. 
 This facile analysis bears little relation to reality. Of course foreigners sell to keiretsu members. But, as studies have indicated, keiretsu companies buy significantly less from abroad than would normally be expected of an economy the size of Japan. Furthermore, cooperation in the form of a joint venture or other long-term relationship is far different from participation in the organizational structure that binds the keiretsu members so closely. Most importantly, why should a foreign firm feel that it must enter a joint venture relationship in order to obtain access to an "open" market?
When foreign companies attend the regular meetings of keiretsu member presidents and are able to dispatch fast-track employees for two-year details to keiretsu firms, then Professor Tsurumi's view that foreigners can join keiretsu might be a reality. If one were to suggest these ideas to Japanese executives, I expect they would die from laughter rather than from karoshi (overwork).
The United States does not want to "break up" keiretsu; it wants an end to the exclusionary nature of these business groupings.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
As Vincent Dispute Heats Up, Disagreement Is Everywhere

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
One of the most belligerent periods in baseball history will reach a crossroads this week when the major league club owners gather in a Chicago suburb to confront each other over the future of Fay Vincent as commissioner.
The outcome of the meeting Thursday is utterly unpredictable, but a strong chance exists that the commissioner, who will not attend the meeting, and his relentless opponents will wind up in court fighting over his job. 
 Feelings are so heated that one Vincent supporter said he was going to the meeting because "someone's got to stand up and say you're full of beans," although he phrased it a bit stronger. And a Vincent opponent said, in reply, that "what he'll probably find is that someone will get up and tell him the same thing."
"Is it unhealthy?" the second owner asked. "It's not more unhealthy than things are now."
Vincent's opponents say that baseball has deteriorated into this angry, paralyzed state because of the commissioner. His supporters say those owners have created the turbulence by their irrational, venomous attacks on Vincent.
"My wife says, 'You people created a fair amount of the discontent,' " one opponent related. "That's true to a certain extent."
 
Few Public Accusations
 Most of Vincent's opponents have declined to discuss their complaints against him.
"I just feel we have so many critical issues facing us because people don't have confidence in him anymore," Bill Giles of the Philadelphia Phillies said Friday, mentioning labor and television as two of the issues. "I don't think it's healthy for the industry, that it's in the best interests of baseball that he remain as commissioner.'
Asked what Vincent has done wrong, Giles said, "I'm going to express my views next Thursday."
Although the dissident owners want Vincent to resign -- his term runs through March 31, 1994 -- he has said he never will. Although they say they can dismiss him with a majority vote of the 28 owners, he has said they cannot, majority vote or any other way.
The two sides don't agree on numbers either. The opponents say they have a majority; they have, in the last couple of months, used figures ranging from 15 to 25. The supporters say no anti-Vincent majority exists.
"I'm quite certain," Giles said when he was asked if the opponents had a majority. "I'd say there are at least 15." Giles, who has said he believes Vincent should resign, declined to identify his colleagues who feel as he does.
 
12 Definite Opponents
 Based on conversations with owners and other executives who would identify the stance of the owners, those clubs definitely aligned against Vincent add to 12: the two Chicago teams, Los Angeles, San Francisco, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, California, Milwaukee, Minnesota, Cleveland and the Yankees.
Owners or high-ranking executives of nine teams have said in interviews that they support Vincent: the Mets, Houston, Montreal, Florida, Baltimore, Boston, Oakland, Kansas City and Texas. Ted Turner of Atlanta has been quoted by others in baseball as saying he supports the commissioner. Marge Schott of Cincinnati has not made any public statements, but she is believed to be a Vincent supporter.
Seattle, Toronto, San Diego, Colorado and Detroit are considered neutral going into the meeting, with Seattle and Toronto probably leaning toward support.
Chuck Armstrong, the Mariners' chief operating officer, who served a previous term as president of the club, said the team's new operating owner, John Ellis, plans to listen to both sides Thursday.
"We're new at this," Armstrong said, "but our dealings with the commissioner have all been favorable. We appreciated him coming to Seattle right after the All-Star Game break at our request. He did a fabulous p.r. job in the community. I have only positive things to say about the commissioner."
 
Baseball's Economy at Issue
 Vincent's transgressions, in the eyes of his opponents, appear to range from his penchant for attending baseball games and sitting in a cart on the field chatting with managers, players, umpires and reporters, to a view of labor relations that some owners feel is too soft toward the players' union.
The state of baseball's economy is at the heart of much of the opposition. Owners see escalating player salaries and declining revenues from a national television package that has to be negotiated. Some of the owners would like to take a hard-line position against the union and break it if they can. They know, however, that Vincent would not stand for that approach.
His opponents say he interfered with their negotiating effort during their 1990 lockout, even though Bud Selig of Milwaukee, the head of the Player Relations Committee, gave him the go-ahead and five of the six members of the P.R.C. board endorsed the settlement he negotiated. The only negative vote was cast by Houston's John McMullen, who now is one of Vincent's staunchest supporters.
In an episode three months ago that turned nasty, Selig and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox tried to get Vincent to relinquish his authority in labor relations, but he declined. Another owner said that the commissioner was ready to give them most of what they wanted -- "He wouldn't give up the best-interests clause" -- but they persisted and created an uglier confrontation.
 
Expansion and Realignment
 Allocation of $190 million in expansion fees and realignment of the National League were two Vincent decisions that angered some owners. After Selig and Douglas Danforth of Pittsburgh failed in nearly six months to reach agreement on allocation of the expansion money between the two leagues, they dropped it in the commissioner's lap. Another owner said the American League could have had nearly 30 percent in negotiations but felt it could do better with Vincent.
The commissioner, after hearing presentations from both sides, awarded the American League 22 percent, or $3 million a club, compared with the National League's $12.33 million a club.
After the Cubs vetoed realignment of the National League in a 10-2 vote that favored it, six clubs asked Vincent to order the clubs realigned. He so ordered and provoked a lawsuit by the Cubs challenging his authority, and now two of the six clubs are among his opponents.
The Tribune Company, owner of the Cubs, has taken the lead in the fight to oust Vincent. It resents his effort to reduce the impact of superstations on local telecasts of games; the company owns a superstation.
But what often seems like an intense dislike for Vincent apparently stems from more than these issues. One lawyer involved in baseball, who has spoken with some owners about the matter, said they view Vincent as "too haughty, too dictatorial, he doesn't know his place, he's arbitrary, he's too big for his britches, he doesn't know who he works for."
The lawyer also said several owners joined the opposition after Vincent summoned three Yankee officials to question them about their testimony in the Steve Howe hearing. The owners, the lawyer said, were outraged that the commissioner would "stomp all over" their rights.
Nothing, however, was said about the owners' trampling the players' rights when they colluded against free agents for three years, as two arbitrators found. Vincent is the only member of management who ever has acknowledged publicly that the owners indeed colluded in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.
"I don't quite understand the venomous feelings involved in this thing because it's not justified," one Vincent supporter said. "Is the commissioner perfect? Of course he's not. But neither are the owners. You can't expect him to win a popularity contest."
One member of the not-so-loyal opposition conceded that maybe everything that is perceived as being wrong with baseball is not Vincent's doing.
"Whether it's the commissioner's fault or not is debatable," he said. "But the problem is the problems that beset this industry. Why did we get to this point where there's all this distress?"

HEADLINE: BOATING;
Fall Boat Shows Seek to Turn Browsers Into Buyers

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
The annual round of fall boat shows, which begin in earnest next month, has called upon marketers to put their best foot forward in hopes of making buyers out of boating's reluctant window shoppers.
The Newport International Boat Show, scheduled for Sept. 10-13 in Newport, R.I., plans to consolidate its annual sailboat and powerboat shows in an effort to fill up what might otherwise have been a sparse showcase of boats. 
 "There has been a continuing weeding out of boat manufacturers," Carla Holmes Little, manager of the Newport show, said last week. "People who come to the shows really keep an eye on how many boats are in the water. That's your critical mass in a boat show. We felt our show couldn't take another hit in a series of slow years."
As many as 165 boats will be on display in the water, and at least another 75 boats, including inflatable craft, dinghies and rowing shells, will be shown on land. Marine accessories, which include navigational equipment, clothing, books and engine hardware, will be located in booths on shore.
Manufacturers of both sailboats and power craft are hoping that the financial morass of the last three years might be beginning to clear. But failed businesses and reduced inventories of boats and gear has made it more difficult than ever for boat show organizers to display the marine industry's best side.
 
'In a Survival Mode'
 The number of boats sold in the United States in 1991 dropped 18 percent from 1990, according to statistics compiled by the National Marine Manufacturers Association of Chicago, an industry trade group. The association had described the boating industry as "in a survival mode."
The N.M.M.A. now estimates that boat sales for 1992 are in a holding pattern. "If there is any growth, it will be moderate," Greg Proteau, an association spokesperson said recently. "There are fewer outlets to buy boats, and stocking levels are as low as they've ever been. The industry has contracted."
A sluggish economy is largely the reason for the slow market. But the industry also places the blame on a Federal luxury tax, initiated in 1991, that levies a 10 percent tax on boats costing more than $100,000. The marine manufacturers group estimates that the levy has cost the industry more than 20,000 jobs in the last 18 months. Intense lobbying efforts in Congress are working for the repeal of the tax.
Despite the dim outlook for manufacturers, some industry officials see a light for consumers. John Grunow Jr., chairman of International Marine Holdings of Guilford, Conn., said in a recent interview that buyers with spending power are apt to get their money's worth at the upcoming boat shows.
"Consumers can expect a lot of innovation because the boat dealers realize that they have to come up with ideas to excite the consumer," Grunow said. International Marine owns 11 boat equipment companies.
At the outer edge of the new boat spectrum is a new solar-powered yacht built by Mog Canal Boats Inc. of Raleigh, N.C. The 30-foot yacht is propelled by twin electric engines that are fed by a bank of 16 6-volt batteries. The batteries are charged by 140 square feet of solar panels above deck.
George McNeir, president of Mog, said that when the batteries are fullycharged, the boat is capable of running for 40 hours at 3 knots. The yacht, which looks like a cross between a powerboat and houseboat, sells for about $150,000. It will be on display at the United States Powerboat Show on Oct. 15-18 in Annapolis, Md.
Jeff Holland, spokesperson for boat shows in Annapolis and Stamford, Conn., said his organization was planning several promotions as a way of enticing buyers. "We have found over the past 8 or 10 years that attendance has been quite steady at the Annapolis shows," Holland said. "What we're doing seems to work just fine, although the number of boats in the water has fallen. But it's not a panic issue at this time. We're plugging along."
His group, Boat Shows of Annapolis, is offering a two-for-one admissions fee Sept. 24-25 at the North Atlantic Sailboat Show in Stamford, which continues through Sept. 27. An adult ticket costs $6 per person. Organizers sent out special mailings to areas yacht clubs as well and are offering discount tickets to local businesses.
At the Norwalk International In-Water Boat Show on Sept. 17-20 in East Norwalk, Conn., visitors can enter a drawing for a free sailing trip with America's Cup skipper, Dennis Conner, in the new 60-foot yacht he plans to sail in the next Whitbread Round the World Race. The contest is sponsored by the Boat Owners Association of the United States and the USA Yacht Club, based in New York.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Clinton Cabinet?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Next to electing Bill Clinton, no issue grips the Democratic power elite more than whom he will name to fill top national security posts.
The Arkansas Governor will come to this task, if elected, with one plus and some problems. The plus is he can lean on Al Gore, who has considerable experience and standing in this field, and his key aide, Leon Fuerth. 
 A minus is that Mr. Clinton's credentials here are suspect. He probably would feel the need to turn to establishment figures to reassure an anxious nation. Even John Kennedy, who had foreign experience, reached out for comforting names like Douglas Dillon for Treasury and Dean Rusk for the State Department. (Note: J.F.K. also threw in some surprises like Bob McNamara for Defense.)
But there is no longer much of an establishment, particularly for Democrats. They have controlled the executive branch, where reputations are made, for only 4 of the last 24 years. So, Clinton appointees would not be as well known and reassuring as the Kennedy Cabinet.
Also, Mr. Clinton says he wants to broaden the definition of national security to include, if not center on, matters like global economic policy and the environment. Yet, the more he would depend on relatively known Democrats and moderate Republicans, the less his government would reflect this new priority.
With these considerations in mind, I telephoned two dozen people who probably would be consulted by a Clinton transition team, and asked for names and comments. The following are the lucky winners (i.e. those who may now indulge in new and perhaps illusory hope).
Secretary of State: Warren Christopher, number two in the Carter State Department (comforting and very cautious); Lee Hamilton, slated as the next chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (sound on policy, no proven executive ability), and Tom Pickering, former U.N. Ambassador and career diplomat (an established pro).
Secretary of Defense: Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee (experienced and expert, unloved by the military); Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee (all of Aspin's pluses and good military ties, but quirky and perhaps too conservative), and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs (very able, but of uncertain party loyalties).
National Security Adviser: Tony Lake, a Carter State Department policy planning chief and now a top Clinton aide (all-around first class, pragmatic, but not well known); Peter Tarnoff, President of the Council on Foreign Relations (former career diplomat and formidable doer); Richard Holbrooke, senior Carter State Department official (brilliant on blending policy and politics, controversial), and Bernard (Mick) Trainor, a former Marine general, now at Harvard (good head, but narrow background).
C.I.A.: Dave McCurdy, chairman of the House intelligence panel (close to Clinton, knowledgeable, unproven executive skills); Bob Inman, retired admiral and former number two at the agency (a well-connected pro, unclear political loyalties), and David Aaron, top Carter N.S.C. official (extraordinarily able and controversial).
Secretary of the Treasury: Pete Peterson, Nixon Commerce Secretary, now an investment banker (politically savvy, intellectual powerhouse, reassuring); Felix Rohatyn, investment banker (terrific ideas, highly respected, little government experience), and Bob Rubin, banker (great manager, short on policy background).
Other names came up frequently for key jobs. Winston Lord and Sam Lewis, both former career diplomats, received rave reviews for U.N. Ambassador. Jessica Tuchman Mathews, a Carter N.S.C. aide, was often cited glowingly for the Environmental Protection Agency and for the Department of Energy. Richard Gardner, a lawyer and teacher, was cited favorably for his exceptional knowledge of "new issues."
High praise for international economic positions went to economists Fred Bergsten, Bob Hormats and Joan Spero (all smart, experienced policy hands) and Roger Altman, a deft banker. John Sculley of Apple Computer was suggested as someone who could handle converting defense jobs. Jim Jones, head of the American Stock Exchange and a former Congressman, got high marks for many posts, including budget director.
More to come. Don't call; I'm going on vacation.

HEADLINE: Contempt for the Voter

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am all too often amazed at the contempt in which American politicians appear to hold the electorate. The latest instance is the showcasing of Marilyn Quayle at the Republican convention (news article, Aug. 18). As a career-sacrificing homemaker, she is supposed to act as a foil to the successful lawyer Hillary Clinton and lure us voters into the Republican fold, attracted by her superior dedication to "family values." 
 Do the Republicans seriously think that the intellectual field of any voter is so narrow and trivial that he or she will be influenced by the domestic choices of the Vice President's wife, when America is sinking under such problems as the economy, crime, drugs, unemployment and abortion legislation, to name a few?
As a registered Republican, I am insulted, and I worry that if intelligence and concern of the voters about important issues are so lightly esteemed by the Republican Party, what will they not try to put over on us if elected?

HEADLINE: Who Won Cold War?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The American electorate is being led to believe that the cold war was won in the four years between Ronald Reagan's ascension to power in 1981 and Mikhail S. Gorbachev's emergence as leader of the Soviet Union in 1985. Completely forgotten are four decades during which the containment policy, forged in the late 1940's by the Truman Administration, and continued by successive administrations, provided the rationale for the Western alliance to counter the threat of Soviet expansionism. 
 The final decline of the Soviet Union, however, was triggered by the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, which ended when the Soviet Union under Nikita S. Khrushchev backed down to President Kennedy's demands for the removal from Cuba of the offending nuclear missiles. In 1964, Khrushchev was dumped; the Soviet leadership under Leonid I. Brezhnev was determined to deal from a position of strength. They initiated a massive expansion and modernization of military forces, greater than any seen before in peacetime.
The Soviet military had first call on industrial production, which still had not fully recovered from the devastation of World War II; the increased burden curtailed any real growth in the economy, which stagnated. Soviet military strategy changed from a defensive to an offensive posture, capable of projecting power beyond its borders through large, mobile ground forces, longer-range combat aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, global surveillance and a blue-water Navy with its own aircraft and forward bases. Behind the facade, the Soviet Union was really the world's largest underdeveloped nation!
Even the United States, the richest country on earth, couldn't afford such waste. It lasted only as long as the tired, scared old men in the Kremlin, the immediate heirs of Stalin did. As Mr. Reagan's luck would have it, Brezhnev, Yuri V. Andropov, Konstantin U. Chernenko and the others expired on his watch. That's how he won the cold war.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Campaign of Hate Can Only Harm U.S.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "George Bush, Prisoner of the Crazies" (Op-Ed, Aug. 16), Garry Wills portrays the political despair that has led the Republican Party to flatter the extreme right. But the festival of cultural hatred that took place in Houston shows the systematic social evil of what Mr. Wills sees as a desperate political strategy. 
 For 12 years, Republican administrations have economically weakened the majority of the population, retaining the support of that same majority through a constant appeal to its fears. Now that the Republican economic game is up and anti-Communism won't play, these appeals intensify.
 The convention's relentless gay-bashing is the ugliest current example. It is unlikely that the white middle-class voter to whom the Republicans want to appeal has given much thought to the chance that a same-sex family will move in next door. But homophobia represents the political correctness of the right. By appealing to this "acceptable" prejudice, the Republicans deliberately and cynically fan the fires of other unacceptable prejudices -- racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia -- through which they hope to win the election.
The politics of cultural hatred is too dangerous to be acceptable as an electoral tactic, even more so when it is based on a long-term record of division and exclusion. The significance of the tactic is not so much that it might -- and that it should -- assure Republican oblivion, but that it might render American society more divided and more dangerous than it has already become in the last 12 years.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Lifting the Lid on Excitement

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
WHEN you complain to the manufacturers, as I sometimes do, that they ought to be making more cars that people want -- and specifically more hardtop coupes and convertibles -- you get some interesting answers.
They'll say, yes, yes, we're working on it. Or they'll shrug off the idea and tell you that people don't drive around with their windows down as they did in the 1950's. With dollar signs in their eyes, they'll say that air-conditioning is a big seller and that consumers really don't want a breath of fresh air. 
 I particularly like that last answer, since it conveniently ignores the fact that, often as not, it is impossible to drive with the windows open. The designers have long since taken away our working vent windows, and many of today's cars have rear panes that are sealed or that go down only halfway.
But the answer is something of a paradox in another sense. When you bother to count, these same people actually have put a surprising number of ragtops out there for our consideration and they are trying to have it both ways.
In all, convertibles are produced by about 25 manufacturers, with prices ranging from $10,254 for the Geo Metro sold by General Motors to about $250,000 for a top-of-the-line Aston Martin from Britain. And more than 30 separate models are in American showrooms, over a third of them from Detroit.
Probably the most traditional of those, in size and design, is the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and the '93 entry will begin arriving at dealerships this week.
The Cutlass is the only soft-top available from Olds, and sales -- even without advertising -- have grown from a paltry 425 in 1990 when it was introduced to 3,984 this year. The projection for '93 is more than 7,000 cars, and an Oldsmobile spokesman said the company is trying to make up its mind about whether to do more.
The choice shouldn't be difficult, since dealers have been hungering for the cars and each one is sold before it is made. According to Vic Ide, Oldsmobile's manager for advanced concepts, advertising has been all but nonexistent because production capacity has been limited and demand already exceeded supply.
The limit on capacity occurs because the convertible actually begins life as a standard Cutlass Supreme coupe that is then shipped to an outside contractor for conversion.
"The car starts at G.M.'s Doraville assembly plant in Georgia," Ide said, "and the bare body goes to Creative Industries, a shop about 15 miles away, just outside of Atlanta. At that time, the coupe's roof is cut off and it gets the rest of its convertible structure. Next, it comes back to the G.M. plant and gets painted and put on its wheels. Then it goes back to Creative Industries for the top installation."
The added structure involves 80 separate body parts, mainly for strengthening. When complete, the convertible weighs 3,589 pounds, 368 pounds more than the original coupe and about as much as a four-door sedan.
"Trust me, we tried to do all of this in-house," Ide said, "but we just couldn't make economic sense of it. The shipping back and forth is expensive, but we wanted all the pieces to be primed for corrosion protection, and creating the convertible was just too disruptive as a part of the assembly process."
The extra parts, the hither and thither and the car's natural sizzle add up to a base price of $22,500, about $4,000 more than a comparably equipped Cutlass coupe. And what you get for the money is a four-place ragtop with the longest wheelbase of any current convertible, a car with surprising room in back, and with a 3.1-liter V6 driving the front wheels through a standard automatic transmission.
For '93, the only serious change is an optional 3.4-liter V6 engine, which will produce 200 horsepower, 60 more than the electric-blue tester (medium quasar blue metallic) with its gray leather interior (graphite) and options that drove the price up to $25,452.
Lisa Crumley, marketing manager for the Cutlass, said the convertible and the coupe seem to appeal to the same age group and the male-female split also is about the same, with men registered as 51 percent of the buyers. But there are differences, and the convertible comes out on top.
"The audience for both of the cars is relatively young, with an average age of 45," she said. "But the convertible buyer has a family income of about $98,000 a year as opposed to $58,000 for the coupe. Seventy-three percent are professional people, compared to 45 percent for the coupe. So the convertible is much more upscale."
As a result, according to the marketing manager, Olds will feature the car in its advertising this year, hoping to generate more interest in its entire line. "The convertible is a real success story for Oldsmobile," she said. "We sell it to exactly the kind of buyer we would like to sell to."
I think I've been saying that. And just wait till somebody comes up with two-tone paint.
 
 
 
BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO GO TOPLESS
 ASSUMING you know how much you want to spend and whether you want to buy domestic or import, there are still a number of things to think about before deciding on the convertible that's right for you.
First, do you want a two-seat roadster, or do you need room in the back for friends, kids, grandkids or the pet giraffe? Most of today's ragtops are of the two-seat variety, but some -- like the Olds Cutlass, the Dodge Shadow and the Infiniti M30 -- offer rear seating.
Is there any room in the trunk? Check out the space and think about how you will use the car. The lamented and long-gone full-size convertible offered the same room as a sedan, but today's models often are less than adequate for a couple of bags of groceries.
How hard is it to put the top up and down? A high price for the car does not necessarily mean that you get a power roof, witness Cadillac's $60,000 Allante. On the other hand, manual tops like the one on Mazda's $15,000 Miata are easy to work. Try before you buy.
If possible, drive the car on the highway. Does the wind buffet you? Can you hold a conversation or listen to the radio? With the top up, can you see anything out of the rear? Does the car rattle and can you live with it?
Last, is the top lined, and do you care? Inner liners are classy and they cut wind noise. They come, naturally, on more expensive cars. The soft cream liner on the $243,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche is particularly nice.

HEADLINE: Voices of Hunts Point Talk of Drugs and Decay, but Rebirth Too

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
On the streets of Hunts Point, young men and women, aimless and bored, hang out in front of storefronts covered with graffiti, abandoned buildings and vacant lots. Dealers brazenly sell drugs, paying children 5 cents to collect used crack vials. A guard at the McDonald's on Garrison Avenue tries to keep prostitutes from using the bathrooms as shooting galleries.
On other streets, children play stickball late into the evening as their parents linger on the sidewalks and stoops to escape hot, humid apartments. A woman on Bryant Avenue grows tomatoes and peppers in her front yard. Government officials from France tour the neat rows of new town houses bearing plaques trumpeting the day they opened. 
 These are the two worlds of Hunts Point in the Bronx -- two conflicting realities that collided early Wednesday morning in a bloody barrage of bullets on Longwood Avenue that wounded 12 people but, miraculously, killed no one.
The shooting, which the police said appeared to involve rival drug gangs trying to expand their turf, underscored the competing visions of a neighborhood, like others in New York City, on the cusp of a rebirth after the urban devastation of the 1970's and 1980's.
"You have stable micro-neighborhoods living next to a war zone," said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "How do you resolve this is the great question."
In more than two dozen interviews since the shootout, men and women, young and old, spoke of their different versions of Hunts Point, what is wrong and what would make it better. They spoke of their lives and their families, of fear and despair, of devotion to the neighborhood and hope for its future.
 
Stephen E. Karsch
Lawyer, 52 years old
 While some see Hunts Point as a neighborhood weighted with urban ills, Stephen E. Karsch sees it as the most promising business site in New York, a hub of commerce and industry that already provides the metropolitan area and parts of the eastern seaboard with much of the meat and produce supplied to supermarkets.
"The most interesting part of the area is that if you could ever make all the pieces fit together -- the creation of a sound industrial base with the large potentially employable number of people -- you've got a utopia," said Mr. Karsch, a lawyer who is co-president of the Hunts Point Terminal Produce Cooperative Association Inc., which is made up of 69 wholesale merchants and had more than $1 billion in sales last year.
For Mr. Karsch, a Long Island resident, the area's economic development and the accompanying improvement in the lives of its residents are inevitable. The question is whether the city will hasten the process.
"The Hunts Point peninsula is very undeveloped in relation to what it represents," he said, pointing to the area's available undeveloped land, its central location and the large labor force nearby. "It has north-south, east-west road access unlike any other borough."
Mr. Karsch said that the city should direct state bond money to Hunts Point for road improvement and other infrastructure projects. There also needs to be an effort to improve residents' reading skills, he said, so that they can better serve businesses. He did not dismiss drugs and crime, but said they would dwindle with economic development.
"In the long run if the infrastructure dollars are there and proposals like the ones for business enterprise zones come to pass, industry will be attracted by it and you're going to lift up that community."

Ernest (Butch) Kelley
Social worker, 38 years old
 For the last 17 years, Ernest (Butch) Kelley has tried to convince people that there is hope for a renaissance in Hunts Point, fighting against the notion of many outsiders, he said, that the area is a "gun-toting war zone that cannot be saved."
Mr. Kelley, who grew up in this South Bronx neighborhood, said that in the last few years, he has been encouraged by the sounds of jackhammers and backhoes renovating long-abandoned buildings, allowing thousands of people to move into new apartments. But the shooting on Wednesday morning, he added, was a painful reminder of the difficulties of improving the neighborhood.
"I was kind of shocked by the shooting," he said, sitting at the offices of United Bronx Parents, a community service group, a few blocks from the crime scene. "That area has started to pick up somewhat. There are kids playing on the streets again. It hadn't been that way for a long time."
Mr. Kelley, who now lives in another part of the Bronx, is a senior counselor at the center and is familiar with the problems -- the drugs, the unemployment, the lack of job training and recreation for youths -- that plague the neighborhood.
"What makes changing it so difficult is that families have come to accept this as commonplace," he said. "They believe that there is no hope. They don't want to see drugs on the street, but they're afraid to speak out. They don't feel that there's anyone to call."
Mr. Kelley nodded his agreement when Victor Goitia, a volunteer at the center, said that more community centers could change the neighborhood's attitude. "Maybe if they started to clean up the streets a little bit more, give the people job training, give them someplace where they can work out their problems, that would help," Mr. Goitia said.
Mr. Kelley said: "When I was growing up here, there were a lot of community centers that stayed open every night and brought people together. Now, there's not a lot for the kids to do. Neighbors don't talk to each other."

HEADLINE: As the Nation's Economy Collapses, Zairians Squirm Under Mobutu's Heel

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Aug. 23

 BODY:
A Madison Avenue hair stylist who calls himself Mr. Andrew says that every two weeks for the last eight years he has traveled here to cut the hair of President Mobutu Sese Seko.
Taking into account Mr. Andrew's first-class air travel from New York, hotel accommodations at the luxurious Inter-Continental Hotel and whatever fee he earns, each presidential haircut is estimated to cost the citizens of Zaire at least $5,000. 
 A few blocks away from the Inter-Continental, in a fetid, fly-infested ward of the Kinoise Clinic, Mwanda Ngimbi is slowly starving to death.
Mr. Mwanda entered the hospital in May after he was robbed and shot by a bandit. He was well enough to leave the hospital in mid-June. But Mr. Mwanda, who earned about $15 a month as a taxi driver, had no money, and hospital officials are holding him under armed guard until he pays his medical bills, which now total about $450 and are mounting daily.
 
Behind the Desperation
 Since the hospital is not feeding Mr. Mwanda and he has no money to buy food, he depends on the charity of other patients. But that is not nearly enough, and now, suffering from severe malnutrition, he is too weak even to sit up.
If Mr. Mwanda is a symbol of Zaire's desperation, Mr. Andrew is a symbol of its cause: the corruption and mismanagement of the Government. While its impressive natural resources sit largely undeveloped, this sprawling Central African country of nearly 40 million people is one of the world's poorest, and getting poorer at a rate that has been gathering ominous speed since September 1991, when a paroxysm of looting and arson wiped out much of its modern industry.
"The vast majority of Zaire is now back to subsistence levels," said Herman Cohen, the American Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, who came here early this month on a fact-finding mission. "And for the first time we're seeing cases of malnutrition."
"It has always been serious," he added, "but now it's getting dangerous."
 
So Rich, and Yet So Poor
 Mbongo Nguodja Harouna, a human rights campaigner whose group, the Voice of the Voiceless, has been trying to win the release of Mr. Mwanda and others in his predicament, said: "People have never suffered like this before. A lot of them have simply given up hope."
Called the Belgian Congo until independence in 1960, Zaire is as big as the United States east of the Mississippi. It is sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous nation, after Nigeria. It is one of the world's major producers of copper and cobalt. It has climatic and soil conditions suitable for growing a wide range of tropical crops, including cotton, rubber, coffee, palm oil and sugar.
This potential has long been frittered away by corruption, brutality and random violence. But the notion persisted that if only the "bad Zairians" who surrounded and ill served Mr. Mobutu were reined, in the country would right itself. Few here dared openly blame the President himself.
There was also a widespread belief among Zairians that the country was too valuable to the West for it to let the misery continue and that if only the Western powers would turn their attention to solving the crisis Zaire would become the great power it was destined to be.
Those days are over. With the end of the cold war, many here have come to realize that the West, and especially the United States, has no intention of rescuing the Zairians from themselves.
 
Repression Is His Weapon
 "We've supported them, yes, and we supported Mobutu," said a Western diplomat with long experience in Africa. "But those days are long over. It's a painful thing for many of them to realize, but Zaire is no longer of great strategic interest."
Even without Western help, Mr. Mobutu hangs on despite a rising public clamor for his removal from the autocratic power he has exercised for 27 years.
The President retains his grip through old-fashioned repression. Virtually every night, unmarked vehicles roar through Kinshasa's dusty streets, bearing grim-faced men in khaki uniforms without insignia. A recent report by the Zairian Human Rights League said these men -- known to Kinshasa residents as the "owls" -- were members of Mr. Mobutu's Special Presidential Guard, and had made numerous assaults against those perceived as political threats to the Government.
"So many people have been attacked and killed by the owls that we can no longer keep track of them," said Mr. Harouna of the Voice of the Voiceless.
But Mr. Mobutu's power has been eroded. He spends most of his time aboard his yacht in the Congo River, and has entered Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, only twice this year, both times briefly and without advance notice, under the cover of night and with a squadron of heavily armed guards. People say that if he were to enter Kinshasa openly and move among this city's five million citizens it is doubtful that he would get out alive, given his tenuous control over the country's security forces.
 
New Constitution Planned
 Bending to public outrage, Mr. Mobutu's representatives have been meeting with opposition leaders since July 1991 in a national political conference intended to draft a new constitution and set a schedule for multiparty elections. This month the delegates began drafting a new constitution enshrining a multiparty system and elected Etienne Tschisekedi, Mr. Mobutu's most prominent opponent, as Prime Minister of a transitional government.
Mr. Mobutu has recognized these changes, but balked at the delegates' symbolic move to change the country's name back to the Congo, nullifying a name change made by Mr. Mobutu in 1971 as part of his policy of ridding the country of vestiges of its colonial legacy. Critics have seized on the name Zaire as a symbol of the President's autocratic rule.
The political conference has deferred the name change. It also appears to have fallen short of the opposition's main objective, namely to force Mr. Mobutu from office, or at least strip him of most of his presidential powers.
"The one thing that everyone agrees on is that we're a long way from getting rid of Mobutu," an opposition leader said. "He's incredibly tenacious, and appears determined to hold onto power at any cost."
Buana Kabwe, chairman of the Zaire League of Human Rights, said: "Everything else in the country may be falling apart, but nothing has changed for Mobutu. He still treats the treasury as if it's his private purse. And he couldn't care less about our suffering."
 
Unpaid Soldiers Mutiny
 Mr. Mobutu's penchant for conspicuous consumption appears unabated. Among his overseas real-estate holdings, for example, are chateaus in Spain and Belgium, a town house in Paris, a villa near Monte Carlo, an estate in Switzerland, a horse ranch in Portugal and a villa in the Ivory Coast.
Last September, Mr. Mobutu's rule seemed about to end. Mutinous soldiers, angered because they had not been paid, began a week of looting and violence.
According to a report in July by Africa Watch, a New York-based human rights advocacy group, as the rioting spread throughout the country, it eliminated most of what remained of the modern productive sector, outside of mining. In the Kinshasa area alone, 90,000 jobs were lost, and in the course of the looting at least 240 people were killed. Today, whole sections of the country are under the control of local commanders who routinely ignore orders from Kinshasa.
The rioting also led to the evacuation of virtually all expatriate workers -- about 20,000 people, mostly from France, Belgium and the United States. They included most of the country's university professors, teaching hospital staff members, and geologists in the mining industry, as well as a host of Belgian development assistance workers who provided a wide range of services to villages in the interior.
 
Many Seek to Leave
 The economic collapse since the September riots has been staggering. The annual inflation rate is more than 5,000 percent, largely because the Government abandoned an economic recovery program devised by the International Monetary Fund in early 1990 and increased spending. In January 1990, the national currency traded at about 300 to the dollar; today the rate is about 650,000 to the dollar.
The September rioting also prompted many Zairians to join the long lines for visas outside every Western embassy. They include many of this country's best-trained and best-educated citizens.
Antoine Beltchira Kalubye, a neurosurgeon at the University of Kinshasa's teaching hospital here, said he knew of at least 100 physicians who had left the country in recent months, most for better paying jobs in South Africa. Senior physicians here make about $75 a month; in South Africa, they can earn about the same amount in a day.
Consequently, the quality of medical services has declined, hardly reassuring patients who are already leery of the system after the wide publicity given to cases of patients held hostage for their medical bills.
"It has become very bizarre," Dr. Kalubye said. "Nowadays the last place people want to come if they fall sick is the hospital."
 
'A Long Way to Go'
 George Nzongola, a Zairian and a professor of African studies at Howard University in Washington who recently returned here after living 18 years abroad, said conditions were worse now than they were before independence.
"Under colonialism, the decade of the 50's was a period of prosperity in the Belgian Congo," said Mr. Nzongola, who is a delegate at the national conference. "The colonialists invested in economic and social services. So most people had access to very good schools and ate three meals a day."
"One person recently told me that we've gone backward 250 years," Mr. Nzongola added, "I hope he's not right."
Asked whether he expected conditions to change, even if Mr. Mobutu were suddenly to disappear from the political scene, Mr. Nzongola shrugged his shoulders.
"We've got a long way to go," he said, "and I hope it's not too late."

Chart: "At a Glance: Zaire"
 
HISTORY
 
Zaire (called Congo until 1971) was under Belgian control from 1885 to June 1960. A period of instability followed independence until November 1965, when Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in a bloodless coup. He has ruled as an autocrat ever since.
 
ECONOMY
 
Although Zaire was classified by the World Bank as the world's 12th poorest country in 1990, with a per capita income of $220, it is the world's largest producer of cobalt and the second-largest producer of industrial diamonds.
 Exports of both commodities are believed to have fallen by as much as 50 percent in the last two years.
 Zaire's other important mineral product is copper, which accounts for 35 to 55 percent of the country's export earnings. Copper production has fallen by 40 percent since 1986.
 Inflation has sharply eroded the value of the Zairian currency. In April, all Zairian banks closed because of cash shortages. Except for the police and armed forces, most civil servants have not been paid for several months.
 
PEOPLE
 
Zaire's nearly 40 million people are divided among many tribes, with the largest being the Kongo, Kwango-Kwilu, Mongo, Luba, Bwaka and Zande. The majority speak Bantu languages, though the north is linguistically Sudanese. The lingua franca is French.
 
GEOGRAPHY
 
Zaire is the third largest country in Africa, one-quarter the size of the United States. Its dominant geographic feature is the Congo River. With vast forests and plenty of rainfall, Zaire has huge agricultural, logging and hydroelectic potential.

HEADLINE: A Lower Gear for Japan's Auto Makers

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
The Nissan Motor Company has gone to great lengths to give customers what they want. Japanese buyers of the Nissan Sunny, known as the Stanza in the United States, can choose from nearly 200 variations with different engines, bodies, tires and transmissions. The company has sold fewer than a dozen units of some combinations.
 But those days are over. Nissan, which said Friday it will lose money this year for the first time in about four decades, is trying to save money by cutting back on the number of variations it is offering, even it if means sacrificing market share. It is also leaving some models on the market longer than the customary four years. And it is trying to use the same parts in more models. Right now, for instance, there are about 70 kinds of steering wheels used in its automobiles, when far fewer would do. 
The move at Nissan is part of a big change occurring in Japan's auto industry. Buffeted by a slowdown in sales and a host of other problems, Japan's auto makers are being forced to modify the vaunted system by which they design, produce and sell automobiles, even as this system is being emulated around the world.
 The system, first developed by Toyota and often called "lean production," involves rapid introduction of models, a flexible manufacturing system that can make many kinds of cars on the same assembly line, low inventories and long-term relationships with suppliers.
 But now, manufacturers are starting to cut the number of products they offer, slow the pace at which they bring out products, reduce their reliance on low prices as a marketing strategy, keep larger inventories and loosen historic bonds with suppliers. And a severe labor shortage in Japan might make it more difficult to attract and retain the skilled, disciplined workers who are a hallmark of the system.
 
Reworking the Toyota System
 "We're looking right now at the most significant shift and the greatest pressure on the Japanese system since it achieved pre-eminence in the early 80's," said Harley Shaiken, professor of work and technology at the University of California at San Diego, who is studying Japanese auto factories this summer. "The Toyota system that powered Japan in the 80's will need an overhaul for the 90's."
 No one expects Japanese companies to abandon lean production, only to modify it. And no one expects the big Japanese producers to fade as a force on the world scene, or even to have problems of the magnitude experienced at times by General Motors or Chrysler.
 But the Japanese manufacturers could become less invincible than they have been in the past, giving Detroit some breathing room. And they could suffer some decline in market share, as they have this year in the United States, where Japanese share of the car and light-truck market has fallen to 24.0 percent in the first seven months of this year from 25.4 percent in the same period last year.
 Driving the changes is the fact that Japan's automobile industry is now in its second year of declining sales and production, making this the most severe downturn the Japanese producers have seen in decades. Total production of Japanese cars, trucks and buses in Japan peaked at 13.5 million in 1990 and will probably be less than 12.6 million this year, according to Merrill Lynch. (Overseas production totaled about 2 million cars in 1990, and is apparently still growing, but the calculations for 1991 and projections for this year have not yet been made.)
 Because of the economic recession in Japan, sales of passenger cars here have fallen 6.3 percent in the first seven months of the year, after registering a 4.6 percent drop in 1991. The domestic market is particularly important for Japanese companies because it is one they alone control, giving them a revenue base that helps them compete elsewhere.
 In the United States this year, sales of Japanese cars and light trucks are down 2 percent, in part because of price increases greater than those of American competitors and because American cars are gaining in quality.
 What really worries executives here is the fear that growth might be over for good. Japan's roads can't handle more cars and exports to Western Europe and the United States are limited by trade agreements. Japanese factories in Europe and the United States can circumvent those restrictions and grow, but in any case, the United States and European markets are also mature.
 
Time to Pay Bills
 The slowdown has hit just as bills for huge plant investments are coming due, dragging down profits. Toyota, Japan's largest manufacturer, announced last week that worldwide operating income for its last fiscal year plunged 56.3 percent to its lowest level in at least a decade.
 The slowdown only compounds other problems in the industry. Japanese companies are under international pressure to use more foreign parts, work shorter hours and reduce cutthroat competitive ways. The tumble in Japan's stock market has made it more expensive to raise money, making profits more important to the financing of vital projects like pollution-free engines. And, many experts say, the Big Three auto makers in the United States are closing the gap with Japan in productivity and quality.
 All this, analysts and executives say, changes the landscape tremendously. "The Japanese industry is at a structural crossroads," said Yoshifumi Tsuji, who has just taken over as the president of Nissan.
 Many analysts have no doubt that Japan will adjust to these problems, as it has in the past. "What they're doing is transforming themselves into companies that will be profitable in a no-growth environment," said Maryann Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York. Eliminating excesses from their system and increasing profits will only strengthen the companies, she said, providing more money to invest in new products and technology.
 Other experts say that the talk of gloom and doom in Japan these days -- and of a resurgence by Detroit -- is merely part of an effort by Japan to defuse trade tensions and head off bills in Congress for even stricter limits on Japanese sales in the United States. "Detroit would wish they had so many problems," said Joseph T. Gorman, chairman, president and chief executive of TRW Inc., a major automobile parts supplier. Defying the Forecasts
 Of course, there have been predictions in the past that growth was over or that the Japanese auto industry would face serious problems, but something always saved the day.
 In the early 1970's, sales slumped because of the recession caused by the surge in oil prices due to the Arab oil embargo. But higher gasoline prices then provided a great boost to small Japanese cars like the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla.
 In 1985 the value of the yen was raised, making Japanese products more expensive abroad. But then, Japan's domestic market defied all predictions and experienced a huge boom. Japanese companies also expanded production in the United States to circumvent export restrictions and moved into new product categories, particularly luxury cars.
 But it is difficult to see where growth will come from in the next few years. Southeast Asia, India, China, the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Latin America all are potentially big markets. Japanese companies are particularly well established in Southeast Asia. But so far, executives say, those markets are too small to compensate for a lack of growth in the Japan, the United States and Europe.
 There are also fewer new product areas left for the Japanese to enter. Some experts say that with their advantage in product quality and efficiency being narrowed by Detroit, Japanese companies might shift to competing on the basis of technology. The company that comes up with a practical electric car or a fuel-efficient engine could see its sales spurt.
 But it's not clear that the Japanese will win this competition. While they lead in developing fuel-efficient internal combustion engines, they lag in alternative-fuel technology, said Stephen Usher, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International in Tokyo.
 If growth does not resume, it could put an intense strain on the Japanese formula that has seen virtually nothing but growth for 40 years. "No one knows for sure what will happen if the growth rate goes down more or less permanently," said Takahiro Fujimoto, a professor of economics at Tokyo University. "The impact on the supply system or the work system might be significant."
 In the past, he said, auto workers, suppliers and stockholders subordinated their desires for the sake of the company's competitiveness, knowing they could share in the fruits of growth. But if growth cannot be assured, he said, these parties might demand a greater piece of the pie.
 
A Shrinking Work Force
 The Japanese companies have already been hurt by a long-term shortage of labor, owing to the shrinking population of young people and the fact that those prosperous youngsters shun assembly-line work. That has forced them to invest heavily in automation and to move plants to more remote areas where it's easier to recruit workers. But that has made it harder for the companies to coordinate with suppliers for the delivery of parts in the small quantities needed for the just-in-time inventory system.
 If auto sales no longer rise steadily, it will also be harder to insure lifetime employment, the underpinning of worker loyalty here.
 The supplier system, in which each company has a network of suppliers, is also coming under stress from lack of growth. Some suppliers are expected to fold and others are selling outside their corporate group.
 Another hallmark of the Japanese system has been the rapid introduction of new models. Japanese companies often introduce a new model after the old one has been on the market for four years, in contrast with five or more years for American companies. Moreover, while Henry Ford, the pioneer of mass production, once offered customers one type of car in any color as long as it was black, the Japanese lean-production system allows for a greater variety of products in smaller production runs.
 Between 1985 and 1991, Nissan increased the its number of models to 60 from 39, but diluted its average sales per model to 22,364 from 26,771, according to Baring Securities.
 Now, however, the growing financial pressure is causing a retrenchment in this practice. Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru cars and has suffered heavy losses, said recently that it would cut in half its number of models. Nissan, while not cutting back on the number of models, is cutting the number of variations of each model.
 "The variety has gotten beyond the ability of factories and suppliers to handle it," said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. who is studying Japanese auto production.
 "The countermeasures to all these problems is to take a step back to something that looks more like conventional mass production," he said. "In some ways, they're becoming more like us." Such a change, he said, could increase profits but would probably reduce market share and lessen the chances for a hit niche product like the Mazda Miata.
 To make things easier on their suppliers, the auto companies are diverting a bit from the just-in-time inventory system.
 
A Longer Product Life
 The Japanese companies are looking at increasing product life cycles. A joint venture of Mitsubishi and Volvo said it would operate on a five-year cycle. When Nissan announced its new March, a small car to be sold in Europe as the Micra, it said the product would have a 10-year cycle.
 Auto companies are also trying to raise prices, but the Japanese market is so depressed that it is proving impossible.
 In the United States, however, Japanese price increases have generally been greater than those made by the American companies in the last year, in part owing to the weakness of the dollar against the yen and to political pressure to be less aggressive in the United States.
 To what extent the auto makers are departing from past practices depends on their situation. Nissan, the second-largest auto maker here, has been the boldest; it is in perhaps the toughest situation among the major companies. It has lost market share in Japan and the United States in the last decade. And it has run up high debts for new factories.
 Mazda is also stretched too thin, analysts say. It introduced 12 models in the last two years and has five sales channels in Japan. But sales through June fell 8.5 percent, the greatest drop among Japan's major manufacturers. But company spokesmen say there are no plans to reduce sales channels and models.
Honda was early in bracing for low growth. Its major investments in new plants are behind it, so they won't drag down earnings. In March, it announced a reorganization aimed at cutting costs, in part by giving manufacturing experts a greater say in how cars are designed.
 Still, Honda's market share in the United States, its main market, has been dropping and the Ford Taurus is now threatening to topple the Honda Accord from its three-year reign as best-selling car in America.
 An exception to the gloom and doom is Mitsubishi Motors, which gained market share in 1991 because of its strength in recreational vehicles, the hottest product area now.
 With vast financial resources and optimism about sales growth, Toyota is resisting some of the more fundamental changes. Instead, it is trying to get through the downturn by "accumulating minor efforts" to cut costs, said Tatsuro Toyoda, who will become president in a month. The company is trying to use more common parts and might consider reducing the number of models, he said.
 The problem is that if one company, especially Toyota, keeps fighting with low prices, numerous models and short model cycles, other companies might feel compelled to do the same. Indeed, if the overall market is not growing, the only way an individual company can grow is by increasing market share.
 Japanese auto makers "don't know how to adjust ourselves to such a market," said Taizo Yokoyama, a managing director of Mitsubishi Motors. "Our experience is we can survive only through expansion."
A JAPANESE BUSINESS TABOO IS FADING
 The news earlier this month that the Toyota Motor Corporation was negotiating to buy bolts from the Saga Tekkohsho Company might have seemed routine. But in Japan, it was like Macy's talking to Gimbels.
 That is because Nissan, Toyota's archrival, owns a third of Saga Tekkohsho. The transaction attests to changes that are starting to loosen the bonds of Japanese supplier networks, or keiretsu, that have been a hallmark of Japan's success.
 In a keiretsu, an auto maker, say, owns parts of various suppliers with which it works closely. These first-tier suppliers in turn buy components from second- and third-tier suppliers.
 While General Motors or Ford tend to make most of their parts in-house, Japanese companies typically rely on their suppliers to design and build 70 percent of their parts. The suppliers also end up being the shock absorbers of the system, absorbing price cuts and layoffs to help cushion the main company from economic downturns.
 But now the keiretsu system is starting to crack. Slowing sales have forced more suppliers to seek new customers, even auto makers of rival keiretsu. In truth, said Takahiro Fujimoto, a professor at Tokyo University, there has always been some cross-keiretsu selling, with the exception that Toyota suppliers didn't sell to Nissan and Nissan suppliers to Toyota. But now even that taboo is ending, he said.
 In addition, Japanese companies are under pressure to loosen the keiretsu system to make it easier for foreign companies to sell auto parts in Japan.
 Analysts say that some suppliers, particularly second- and third-tier ones, will go out of business in the current downturn. That might leave fewer, bigger suppliers that will sell to more than one company. But, said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Inc. in New York, it could lead to lower-cost parts and allow the smaller Japanese auto companies to better take advantage of the sophisticated Toyota and Nissan suppliers.
SQUEEZING THE SMALL FRY
 The downturn in Japan's automobile industry could end up shaking out the smaller of Japan's automobile companies. Even during boom times, analysts were saying the market could not easily support a dozen Japanese vehicle manufacturers.
 Already, a Japanese-style consolidation has been under way, with companies remaining independent but being controlled by larger companies. Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru cars, has had huge losses and is now essentially controlled by Nissan. Daihatsu, which pulled out of the American market this year, is part of the Toyota group.
 Rumors are now swirling that Isuzu Motors, which has also been losing money, is thinking of getting out of passenger cars to concentrate on its main business of trucks. The company vigorously denies the rumors.
 In any case, almost all of Isuzu's meager supply of cars -- 130,000 vehicles last year and dropping -- is sold to General Motors, which resells the cars as the Geo Storm. G.M., which owns 37 percent of Isuzu, in December sent one of its executives to help run the Japanese company. Stephen Usher, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International, said G.M. might do well to buy Isuzu and use it to produce G.M. cars for sale in Japan.

HEADLINE: Wasting Away

BYLINE: By Keith Schneider; Keith Schneider is a national correspondent specializing in environmental reporting for The New York Times.

 BODY:
From the bright sunlight and mesquite of the high plains in southern New Mexico, it's a five-minute elevator ride down to the spectral darkness of the world's first deep geologic repository for nuclear wastes. Nearly 2,200 feet underground, the air is warm and tastes of salt dust stirred up by the fleet of forklifts, carts and debris haulers that turn the wide passages mined from rock salt into thoroughfares as busy as a small-town main street.
In one corridor, light floods from the mouth of a storage room filled with stainless-steel pumps and red digital gauges. Overhead, steel beams, rock bolts and wire mesh support the roof. Down another corridor, the sound of metal pounding on the rock salt walls resonates with the same painful clarity of a jackhammer breaking up concrete. Burly miners run the big machines, their headlamps like bouncing scratches of light against the midnight black. 
 What began in the early 1950's as Project Salt Vault has now become the most elaborate and expensive tomb ever built in the United States. The Department of Energy has been testing a 40-year-old theory in the $1.3 billion waste plant: that prehistoric salt beds might be the best place to entomb radioactive wastes. Salt lies deep in the earth and can easily contain deadly radiation. Salt is also comparatively soft and creeps like ice under intense geologic pressures. Over time, rock salt would gradually flow around the buried radioactive wastes, sealing them in a permanent hard cocoon.
The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant -- or WIPP, as it is popularly known -- is a seven-mile lacework of shadowed passages and murky storage rooms 26 miles east of the town of Carlsbad. It is the closest the Government has ever come to a final solution for ridding the country of the lethal byproducts of manufacturing nuclear arms. With the exception of Sweden, which is testing a deep repository mined from granite, no other nation is close to developing a permanent radioactive waste site of this scale.
WIPP had all the makings of an ideal solution if it were not for a serious flaw. Desperate to find an answer to ridding weapons plants of accumulating radioactive poisons, the Government chose the site in New Mexico not on the basis of carefully analyzed geological data but on economic and political grounds -- specifically, in response to layoffs in the potash industry around Carlsbad.
The nuclear-waste repository is hemmed in by underground pressurized reservoirs of brine that, sometime in the future, could flood the repository, pushing contaminants to the surface to harm future generations. In 1981, crew members drilling a test well at a site known as WIPP 12, about a mile north of the center of the repository, narrowly escaped serious injuries when they punctured a reservoir and the pressurized brine blew out their rig. The incident, which was not widely publicized, illustrates a major weakness in the repository's location. If knowledge of WIPP's existence should fade -- a certainty, given the shortness of human memory and given the repository's design life of more than 240,000 years -- future generations drilling the area for oil or gas or for other uses could penetrate the pressurized brine reservoir beneath the repository.
Evidence of water seeping into a repository designed to be bone dry became apparent as early as 1984, but construction work continued. Government scientists also found that the salt walls were closing in at a rate three times faster than expected. Cracks in the ceilings and walls began to appear in 1989, but were not noted in an environmental- impact statement published that year meant for Congress and the public. A year later, a roof in an experimental room collapsed; five other collapses have occurred since.
For most of its existence, WIPP was managed by the Energy Department as though it were a simple salt mine and not a vital nuclear project that merited full public disclosure and open public debate. As word of the repository's technical problems began to filter out of Carlsbad in the late 1980's, citizens in the state grew restive about its safety. A broad popular movement against it quickly developed in New Mexico.
In 1990, the anti-WIPP forces elected Tom Udall -- the scion of one of the Southwest's most powerful political families -- as state Attorney General. Udall, the son of former Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall, had run on a platform promising to bar the opening of WIPP until every safety question had been answered and the Government had followed the letter of its environmental laws.
For the 44-year-old Udall, WIPP represented an almost transcendent moment: to press the nuclear-weapons industry to obey state and Federal environmental laws. He knew how much the Energy Department's $5.5-billion-a-year cleanup program meant to reclaiming some of the most beautiful stretches of the West that have been contaminated by the Government's nuclear-arms industry. But he also insisted that permanent nuclear-waste disposal sites be safe.
Facing Udall a continent away was Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, a 65-year-old nuclear engineer and retired admiral who was completing a distinguished career in the atomic-arms industry. Asked by President Bush in 1989 to deal with the chaos in the industry, Watkins quickly seized on WIPP as the best chance not only to solve the industry's most vexing waste-disposal problem but also to make a significant mark on the technology he loved.
Watkins believed the lessons learned in New Mexico might prove invaluable in calming public fears and that WIPP would lead to the construction of a separate repository in Nevada for even more lethal radioactive wastes from civilian nuclear-power reactors. He was adamant that WIPP open in 1991, whether or not he had Congressional approval.
The fate of the nuclear-waste repository, therefore, lay in the hands of two men who have never met and who came from two generations shaped by different views of the Government's responsibility to the land and the people.
"I LOVE WIPP!" JAMES WATKINS shouted to a crowd of Energy Department employees and civic officials in a rare public outburst three years ago in Albuquerque. The occasion was a dinner to boost morale and alert his critics that he was intent on following through on his pledge to President Bush to get WIPP opened.
That morning, dressed in coveralls and wearing a hard hat and miner's lamp, Watkins had taken the long elevator ride down to the salt passages for a tour of WIPP. Energy Department engineers who accompanied him remember how impressed they were by his pointed questions. Here, at last, was a leader who was well versed in engineering and construction and who understood the complexities of managing a project like WIPP. Watkins is a nuclear submariner and former chief of naval operation; his predecessors were two lawyers and one dentist.
Watkins's desk-pounding tirades after receiving bad news or for disciplining aides have become legendary at the Department of Energy. The same intensity and need to gain control of any situation are evident at work and at home. Two years ago, he stopped one of his daughters from marrying a man he considered unsuitable for her.
When Watkins took command of the Energy Department in March 1989, the WIPP program was in turmoil. Six months before, the department's first try at opening WIPP imploded during a Congressional hearing. Under withering cross-examination by Mike Synar, a Democratic Representative from Oklahoma and one of the toughest critics of the department, Federal engineers said they did not know if the repository had been built correctly and could be operated safely.
In many ways, the problems at WIPP represented a collapse in the management, morale and mechanics of the American nuclear-arms industry. A cold-war curtain of secrecy, coupled with inattention by Congress and a succession of administrations, had allowed poorly maintained nuclear reactors and dangerous nuclear processing plants to continue operating without any sort of public scrutiny.
The public was not informed of nuclear accidents at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina and at the Hanford reservation in Washington State. The industry's lethal radioactive and chemical wastes were spread across miles of open ground in the West, poured into rivers and lakes in the East and dumped where it was most convenient and least expensive throughout the 12 states where there are nuclear-weapons plants and laboratories. When the true extent of the environmental contamination and the dangerous operating conditions were finally exposed in 1988, the Reagan Administration ordered nuclear-arms production plants shut down.
Watkins, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was hired by President Bush to fix a broken industry.
RADIOACTIVE WASTES are the only substances produced in the 20th century that will still be deadly to the inhabitants of the 2,000th century. The quest for a disposal site for civilian and military radioactive wastes began formally on Feb. 28, 1955, when the Atomic Energy Commission, the predecessor of the Department of Energy, asked the National Academy of Sciences to establish a committee of eight scientists to develop "a program of research pertinent to the methods of disposing of radioactive waste materials in geologic structures." On March 11, 1957, the committee completed a report that identified beds of rock salt that lay under New York, Michigan, the Gulf Coast and the Great Plains from Kansas to New Mexico as the most promising sites for permanent disposal.
The Atomic Energy Commission assigned the search for a suitable disposal site to scientists at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, one of the three original secret nuclear plants where materials for the first atomic bombs were developed in the mid-1940's. In 1962, after being invited by the leaders of Lyons, Kan., to investigate an abandoned 70-year-old salt mine near town, Oak Ridge scientists selected the site for the Government's first attempt to build a deep geologic repository for civilian and military radioactive wastes.
The Government spent $100 million on the Lyons project before abandoning it in early 1971. Chief among the problems was the Government's failure to take into account dozens of unmapped oil and gas drilling holes around the old Lyons salt mine. State geologists argued that if water from underground reservoirs ever filled the bore holes, the surrounding salt would dissolve, the repository could be flooded and radiation flowing to the surface would result in a deadly manmade environmental disaster.
In October 1971, the Atomic Energy Commission scientists proceeded to Carlsbad. They had been invited there by executives of the United States Potash Company, which had closed a mine east of town three years earlier, but which was familiar with the deep salt beds that lay beneath the region's potash reserves. This 2,000-foot-thick seam of salt beginning 850 feet below the desert was the southern edge of the same Permian Basin salt beds that lay under Lyons.
In August 1972, the Atomic Energy Commission announced that southeastern New Mexico was under consideration for a repository. Carlsbad residents welcomed the news. The potash industry, which had employed as many as 3,000 workers in the mines east of town, was in decline as a result of competition from Canadian mines. The town was familiar with deep rock mining and eager for more secure Government jobs.
AT THE FOOT OF the Lost River Range in the desert of eastern Idaho lies an enormous white dome, inflated by air and containing thousands of white barrels and gray boxes of plutonium wastes. Piled outside are thousands more barrels covered with soil and grass to contain radiation and to prevent damage from the elements. In all, this lonely stretch of dry lands at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, an Energy Department weapons plant, is home to 129,000 drums and 11,000 boxes of sludge, clothing, glass vials, metal cuttings and countless other pieces of debris contaminated with plutonium.
For 37 years, Idaho had been the Government's nuclear-waste safety valve. Plutonium wastes from the Rocky Flats plant near Denver, which milled plutonium into spheres that triggered nuclear weapons, were shipped by rail north to the desert dump on a weekly schedule. Periodically, the wastes became a public issue. The Energy Department sought to quell concern by assuring Idahoans that it would end shipments and move the wastes to a permanent repository. Some of the promises were 20 years old. In October 1988, after the first attempt at opening WIPP failed, Cecil D. Andrus, the Democratic Governor of Idaho, barred any more nuclear wastes from entering his state. Thus, finding a permanent home for plutonium wastes became a pressing matter.
Seven months later, Watkins began his campaign to open WIPP, preparing for it as though it were a military tactical exercise. First, he established special teams of engineers from the Energy Department to review every document and to develop a new data base on the repository's design, engineering, construction and operations. By mid-1991, the final safety analysis report and the department's operational readiness review were completed. These two documents -- certifying that the repository was safe to operate -- were reviewed and approved by internal and independent committees.
The next task -- understanding how the repository would function over the full length of its 240,000-year life, or the time that plutonium remained radioactive -- proved much more problematical. Nobody had tried to predict the performance of a manmade structure tens of thousands of years in the future, but such information was necessary to gain a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency to operate the repository.
Watkins proposed to open WIPP for a five-year program of experiments involving up to 9,000 drums of wastes. To meet an E.P.A. requirement for the tests, the Energy Department had to find out what was inside each drum. Such data would be useful in determining how the wastes might behave underground, the E.P.A. said.
In Idaho, engineers looked at the barrels of waste sitting in a building commonly used for indoor tennis and scratched their heads. For years, the department's employees used the barrels like wastepaper baskets, throwing in contaminated debris, never imagining that someday someone would want to know precisely what was in them. Finding out was not a simple matter of opening the lids or cutting the drums open. Plutonium dust is highly mobile and in even tiny quantities can be lethal if ingested or inhaled.
So the Energy Department spent millions of dollars to install remote sensing equipment at the Idaho laboratory. The equipment is supposed to be able to chronicle the contents, measure the radioactivity and determine how much gas has formed inside from the decay of organic chemicals and other debris. Such gas formation has turned out to be a critical part of WIPP's long-term safety, since scientists have determined that over thousands of years the gas could build up in the repository and cause an explosion or enough pressure to crack the walls and cause radiation to escape.
There were only two problems with the content-deciphering process: time and cost. According to WIPP's Federal managers, it takes a week for technicians in Idaho to complete the examination of a single drum, at a cost of $100,000 per drum, with each drum accompanied by a 2,400-page report. At this rate, it would take 180 years and $9 billion just to prepare enough wastes to conduct Watkins's experiments.
In October 1991, when Watkins said the plant was ready to open, the Energy Department had just one test bin with four barrels of waste to drop into WIPP. Watkins was well aware of this, says Arlen Hunt, the manager of WIPP. None of the WIPP officials suggested to Watkins that he hold off the opening until more barrels were ready.
A third critical item on Watkins's plan was to gain the legal and legislative authority to open WIPP. This involved the control of the land above the repository, which has belonged to the Department of the Interior since 1850, when New Mexico became a United States territory. The 1983 land order that allowed the Department of Energy to construct a nuclear-waste repository also prohibited the transport of radioactive materials into it. Watkins sought to have the prohibition lifted. Despite clear opposition during nationwide public hearings, Manuel Lujan Jr., Secretary of the Interior and a retired Republican Congressman from Albuquerque, did just that on Jan. 22, 1991, without offering any public explanation.
"This was a temporary withdrawal for experiments," Lujan says. "This is my home state. I was a Congressman for 20 years and during all that time I dealt with nuclear issues. I felt comfortable in approving this decision."
Lujan, however, did not give Watkins complete carte blanche. He directed the Energy Secretary to limit the number of barrels to the amount that could be retrieved in the event WIPP did not become a permanent dump. Lujan also insisted that wastes could not be shipped to WIPP until Watkins could certify that the repository had passed all its technical requirements and was ready to open.
That moment came in September 1991, when the last of the independent panels reviewing WIPP's readiness issued its approval. Faced with the high cost of maintaining the repository -- nearly $500,000 a day -- and demands from the Governors of Idaho, Colorado and Nevada to open WIPP, Watkins had to move. On Oct. 3, he notified Lujan that all the work was finished. Later that day, Watkins alerted New Mexico that the first truck, with just four drums of contaminated glassware, would roll on Oct. 10 from Idaho.
THIS WHOLE subject of the nuclear industry highlights the incredible faults and problems with secrecy and power and arrogance," Tom Udall says late one winter afternoon as he is about to head home from his office in Santa Fe. His Volkswagen Rabbit initially slips on the icy streets, but soon settles down.
"The attitude that existed then, and still exists, is 'We know what's best,' " Udall says. "It's that attitude that has hurt them across the board with their credibility with the public."
Like his father, Tom Udall is first and foremost an environmentalist. He admired his uncle -- Morris Udall, who ran for President in 1976 and served as the chairman of the House Interior Committee for 14 years until he retired last year. But he revered his father, Stewart, who, during his eight-year tenure at the Interior Department under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, preserved tens of millions of acres of wild lands as national parks and monuments and wrote some of the basic American environmental laws, including the Wilderness Act of 1964.
Tom Udall carries himself with his father's straight-backed assurance and even talks like him. Like his father, he is a lawyer (his law degrees are from Cambridge University and the University of New Mexico), and his first encounter with the nuclear-weapons industry came in 1978, as he was about to become an assistant United States attorney in Albuquerque. That September, the senior Udall asked his son for help in investigating a case in St. George, Utah. The city was east of and directly downwind from the Nevada Test Site, the Government's atomic-bomb testing range.
Radioactive debris from many of the atomic blasts in the 1950's and early 60's had fallen on St. George. By the late 70's, St. George was seeing excessive levels of cancer. In a Mormon population that did not smoke or drink, women were killed by lung, breast and ovarian cancer; men, by bladder, skin and soft tissue cancers; children died of leukemia. The high incidence of cancer in St. George and across the Colorado Plateau would later be confirmed by health researchers from the University of Utah and the United States Public Health Service. But in 1978, the Department of Energy's field officers in Albuquerque and Las Vegas dismissed reports of health problems as the hysterics of an ill-informed public.
The Utah case and several others Stewart Udall brought on behalf of Navajo and uranium miners in the Southwest became landmarks in environmental and public-health law. They were the first to reveal how the Government's nuclear cold warriors had disregarded the safety of their own people.
On Oct. 3, 1991, when word reached Tom Udall that Watkins had announced a shipment of radioactive wastes to New Mexico, he proceeded to mount a counterattack. On Oct. 9, he sent Deputy Attorney General Manuel Tijerina to Washington to file suit in Judge John Garrett Penn's District Court to block the shipment. Three weeks later, Udall also flew to Washington, spending five days preparing his case. On Nov. 15, he walked into Judge Penn's court.
Citing the Interior Department land order of 1983, which prohibited the transport of radioactive wastes to WIPP, Udall characterized the unexplained change of policy in January 1991 as the unlawful breaking of a solemn pact by the Government with the people of New Mexico.
"From the start of this project, this promise was contained in Congressional testimony, in budget documents, in letters back and forth between assistant secretaries in the Department of Energy and the Department of Interior, and in various public land orders. The promise was . . . embodied in the law."
Displaying a photograph of the myriad structural problems he contended still existed with WIPP, Udall singled out the roof collapses. In effect, he argued, once the Energy Department put any radioactive wastes in WIPP, it would not be able to get the drums out at the end of the five years of tests. This was tantamount to a permanent change in the use of the public land, and only Congress, Udall said, had the authority to permanently withdraw Federal land.
Udall's case boiled down to proving that the repository was unstable. And the proof was in the Government's own documents. Pressed by the geological weight of the rock layers above it, WIPP's salt walls are closing in at a rate three times faster than the Government had anticipated. The result is that the first rooms mined in WIPP in the early 1980's began collapsing in 1990.
On June 19, 1990, a team of technicians were stunned to see a pile of rubble lying in the room they had been taking measurements only days before. "We could have been in there when it happened, and thinking about it even now scares the hell out of me," says Tia Mills, a 25-year-old member of the team, who left WIPP last October. "Every time we went into that room, we discussed it among ourselves that we shouldn't be in there, because when that stuff comes down it doesn't give you any warning."
That incident caused a furor at WIPP. Managers were transferred. An investigation revealed that rock gauges were picking up swifter rates of salt movement in the ceiling of the room, but at WIPP no one had read the computer printouts for at least one month prior to the collapse. "We're looking at that data now day by day," says Wendell D. Weart, WIPP's chief scientist and a geophysicist at the Sandia National Laboratories, which is WIPP's technical adviser.
Scientists at Sandia have dismissed the importance of most of the roof collapses. According to Weart, five of the six ceiling collapses were in experimental rooms mined early in the 1980's that had been heated to study the salt's "creep." He insists that formulas have been developed for predicting a collapse -- well before ceilings collapsed and rooms shown to be unstable were sealed off.
Early last year, Watkins appointed a panel of independent mining experts to study the situation. It concluded that the stability of the ceiling in the storage room to be used for the experiments could not be guaranteed before the tests were completed. Some panel members suggested a system of beams and bolts to support the ceilings, which Watkins ordered installed last summer. State and Federal mine inspectors who evaluated the system said they were confident the new ceiling support would keep the room open long enough to conduct the tests.
But Udall wasn't convinced. Jack Parker, a geologist and mining engineer from White Pine, Mich., and a member of Watkins's special panel to evaluate the collapses, said in an affidavit for Udall that the roof supports would not work.
The Energy Department's lawyers argued that Stewart Udall was overstating the problems and the repository was sound and safe. They also argued that Lujan's removal of the restriction prohibiting the transport of nuclear wastes into the area was legal and valid.
On Nov. 26, however, Judge Penn issued a temporary injunction. It declared Watkins's maneuver to be illegal and barred the Energy Department from hauling any wastes to WIPP. The judge agreed with Udall that the Interior Department and the Energy Department had no authority under law to change the land order in January 1991. The Energy Department, further stated the judge, had "presented no convincing evidence that the hazardous-waste materials they seek to introduce in the WIPP site can be retrieved." He concluded that Udall had shown that New Mexicans could suffer harm if radioactive wastes were introduced in a repository that was not ready to accept them.
On Feb. 3, 1992, Judge Penn made the prohibition permanent until the Energy Department did as Udall demanded and gained Congressional approval for the opening of WIPP. The same day, the judge also ruled on separate lawsuits filed by two national environmental groups and two state environmental organizations; he barred Watkins from placing any wastes in WIPP until the Energy Department completed the process of securing a hazardous-waste handling permit from the State of New Mexico.
In March, the Energy Department appealed the rulings. On July 10, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the lower court's decision, affirming the law that said Congress must enact the necessary legislation to open WIPP.
In June, the National Academy of Sciences said in a report on WIPP that most of the experiments planned by the Energy Department for its opening had little scientific merit.
Last month, the House approved its version of a bill that would transfer the land above the repository from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Energy. But the House version included at least five new barriers that could indefinitely prevent WIPP from opening. Among the provisions in the House bill is one that requires the Environmental Protection Agency to establish new standards for the disposal of radioactive wastes before any can be put in WIPP. In 1987, the old standards were struck down by a Federal Appellate Court in Boston for being too lax, and the E.P.A. has yet to complete a draft of the new standards. Another provision in the House measure will require public comment and E.P.A. review of any test proposed for the repository.
The Senate had passed its version of the bill last November, and a conference committee to resolve the differences between the two bills has just begun to meet.
Lately, Watkins and his aides have adopted a glum new motto that is heard frequently in the dark halls of the Energy Department's Washington headquarters: Waste is a terrible thing to mind. The fear among the Government's engineers and their critics is that WIPP's considerable problems may be insurmountable and that a billion-dollar investment may go down the drain.
Although the theory of using salt to emtomb radioactive wastes is a sound one, say many scientists, what WIPP has shown is that in the 1990's, when it comes to nuclear issues, the technical problems are far less formidable than the political ones. Since the Manhattan Project of World War II to build the bomb, the ethos of the industry's leaders has been to build technically sophisticated, one-of-a-kind nuclear facilities under costly crash programs. What opponents of the WIPP program are saying is that the building of these nuclear facilities cannot be decided solely by scientists or the Energy Department: the public has to be involved in every phase of development if such projects are to have any chance of success.
In the meantime, the Energy Department is spending $14 million a month to keep WIPP's staff (now numbering 900) together and the equipment operating. Plutonium wastes slated to be buried at WIPP remain stored in hundreds of thousands of steel drums in California, Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Illinois, Tennessee, South Carolina and Ohio. Vast stretches of land contaminated by dangerous nuclear-bomb industry wastes still need to be cleaned up in these and 20 other states as well as in Puerto Rico and several Pacific Islands; if and when that is done, it is anybody's guess whether the mountains of contaminants that will be collected will have a final storage place.

HEADLINE: Bus Companies Get Ready for School

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
IN the wake of a recent fatal charter-bus crash in New Jersey, the approaching new school year brings questions about where school districts get the buses that transport thousands of Westchester students each day, and how they monitor the performance of the drivers and the vehicles.
"Transportation is especially important in the northern part of the county where distances are greater," said Dr. Jeffrey Hansen, deputy superintendent of the Bedford Central School District, which is composed of five elementary schools, a middle school and a high school. 
 "We supply bus service to 3,000 students within a 50-mile radius and that includes special-ed students who must be taken to schools as far away as Manhattan and Nyack," he said. "Our transportation budget is $3 million a year."
This year, the contract that covers about 40 percent of the students in the Bedford district has been awarded to the Bedford Bus Company, a division of the White Plains Bus Company that has been certified to carry students. Dr. Hansen said that Bedford was one of five companies bidding on a three-year, $3.7 million contract.
Dr. Hansen said districts choose bus companies by first sending out specifications to local companies interested in obtaining the business.
 
A Rigorous Process
 "Specifications are very detailed," he said. "We ask them about their financial ability. We tell them the number of mechanics we expect them to have on duty, and we ask them how many backup people they employ. We also demand that they provide us with an on-site safety coordinator. Eventually we contact the Department of Motor Vehicles to check out the backgrounds of their drivers."
Then, in accordance with state law, the contract must go to the lowest bidder. But unlike some small charter bus companies that skirt the law by evading state registration and inspection requirements, chartered school buses must meet stiff state and national regulations before they can carry students.
"They don't go out on the road until they are certified by a State Transportation Department inspector, who makes the inspection in person," Dr. Hansen said. "And the inspectors are very strict. I've seen them fail a bus because a tiny piece of chrome was missing from a bumper."
Running a bus company properly, said John Silvani, the president of the White Plains Bus Company and its Bedford Bus division, requires both a lot of capital and a lot of labor.
Referring to the charter bus companies that are not licensed to carry students, he said: "The way the system is set up is that it relies on owners to see that their drivers are tested, their buses are inspected and that all the information is reported properly to the state. Who knows how many gypsy charter companies are operating illegally. The Department of Transportation doesn't know because they don't have enough inspectors to go out in the field and track down every company that puts an ad in the Yellow Pages."
A new coach costs $250,000, Mr. Silvani said. "Then there's a minimum $5 million liability insurance per vehicle. That's a big investment. The gypsies buy an old Greyhound for $25,000 to $30,000 and they register it improperly. Eventually they drop the insurance and keep the plates and for all practical purposes that bus is invisible -- there are no records of it anywhere until something happens."
 
Operates 200 Buses
 Mr. Silvani, who bought the White Plains Bus Company 18 months ago, has been in the transportation business since 1968, when he began as a part-time driver for the Riverdale Country Day School while he was an undergraduate at Manhattan College in Riverdale.
"Although my father, who is a professor at Fordham, encouraged me to study mechanical engineering, I went into the bus business because I found it so interesting," he said. "I started driving a school bus for a Yonkers company."
Mr. Silvani operates a fleet of 200 school buses. In addition to the Bedford School District, he has contracts with school districts in White Plains, Elmsford and Harrison. The White Plains Bus Company also serves day camps and conducts an active charter bus business.
"This year we have several of the new forward-control school buses," he said, referring to a new snub-nosed model with a wraparound windshield. "They cost $45,000 apiece, which is 20 to 30 percent more than a conventional school bus, but they have superior visibility."
The newer school buses in his fleet have seat belts, but the state has not required that older buses be retrofitted with belts because school officials say it would be too costly and would not necessarily improve safety on the older models.
Drivers earn $12 an hour, with a guarantee of a minimum four hours work a day, or 20 hours a week, he said. Senior drivers can earn $32,000 to $33,000 a year.
Mr. Silvani said that unlike the 1980's, when unemployment was low and recruiting drivers was difficult, "today we are finding both quantity and quality out there."
"We've hired several professionals, including a construction engineer who was laid off last year," he said. "We like drivers who live in the community, retirees and women. About 35 to 40 percent of our drivers are women but we'd like more because women are especially good with the younger children."
New drivers are given a classroom and road-training program before taking the Department of Motor Vehicles test, he said.
 
A Demanding Job
 "They also have to pass a rigorous physical test, which, among other things, measures hand-eye coordination," he added. "Recently we had 60 candidates at the Fox Lane campus in Bedford preparing for the Motor Vehicle test. Among them were a 57-year-old retired janitor and a 50-year-old former president of a division of a Fortune 500 company who lives in Bedford, took early retirement and found he wants to do something -- and that something is driving a school bus."
Mr. Silvani said he works closely with the Bedford School District to coordinate the schedules and design the routes for 400 separate bus runs a day, a total of 5,000 miles.
"A bus ride is part of the whole school experience a child goes through," he said, adding that he believes a bus company's performance affects the educational environment. "But our drivers are trained to keep discipline in accordance with the school's own practices."
Transporting youngsters to school is a recession-proof business, Mr. Silvani remarked. He said profits average 5 to 10 percent a year.
"In this business, building equity is more important than operating profits," he said. "The real profit comes from owning equipment. A $45,000 bus that you can sell for $15,000 nine years later becomes an asset."

CITY OF EROS
New York City, Prostitution, and the Commercialization of Sex, 1790-1920.
By Timothy J. Gilfoyle.
Illustrated. 462 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95. 
 IN January of 1857, the Rev. William Berrian matter-of-factly informed his congregation at Trinity Church, one of New York's wealthiest and most prominent parishes, that during his 50-year ministry he had visited "houses of ill fame" some 10 times. "The congregants, and other New Yorkers, reacted with surprising aplomb," writes Timothy J. Gilfoyle in "City of Eros," a fascinating study of prostitution in 19th-century New York City. "So commonplace and central was prostitution to metropolitan life that even the philanderings of a prominent minister hardly shocked New York."
From 1820 to World War I, prostitutes lived and worked in almost every neighborhood in the city and solicited in bakeries, cigar stores, delicatessens, barber shops, hotels, saloons, theaters and the best restaurants. They were visited by men of every ethnic group, social class and occupation. There were brothels located in Corlears Hook, at the easternmost end of Manhattan, for the laborers and seamen who lived nearby; and brothels on the West Side, convenient to Columbia College and the neighboring College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Mr. Gilfoyle, an assistant professor of history at Loyola University in Chicago, does not simply catalogue the omnipresence of the prostitutes. He situates their trade in the economic life of the city. As he tells us, "the major factor inducing young women to sell their bodies was the low wages for female labor. . . . Like peddling, scavenging and ragpicking, prostitution turned something with little value into something with cash value."
The women were not the only ones who made money -- and certainly not the ones who made the most -- from selling their bodies. The city's landlords, from the aristocratic John R. Livingston to the anonymous corner grocer, profited by renting space to prostitutes at premium rates. Corrupt politicians and policemen demanded and received protection money for looking the other way. Rent money and payoffs together went a long way toward insuring the survival of the trade, no matter how vociferous and well organized the remonstrations of vice crusaders like the Rev. Charles Parkhurst and Anthony Comstock.
Mr. Gilfoyle's story ends rather abruptly in the 1920's, when, according to his account, "commercial sex grew less public and increasingly covert." Though the reformers, the politicians and the police would take credit for the cleanup, the simple truth was that the economic and social forces that had made prostitution a viable proposition for working women now pushed it to the margins. Prostitution would not of course disappear entirely from the city, but it would never again be as public or profitable as it had been.
"City of Eros" is social history at its best, beautifully written, with a mosaic of rich detail that informs but does not overwhelm the narrative line. Mr. Gilfoyle introduces us to dozens of incredible characters and allows them to speak directly to us from the pages of court records, guidebooks, vice commission investigations, newspaper reports and exquisitely stylized descriptions of the New York underworld. One wonders at times if he does not place too much faith in the veracity of his witnesses -- especially the vice crusaders who had a stake in exaggerating the prevalence of prostitution. And while he is to be commended for rescuing these working women from anonymous victimhood, there are moments when Mr. Gilfoyle overreaches his mark and underplays the exploitation, degradation, violence and disease that must have been as much part of prostitutes' lives as the dollars they earned.
Still, in the end one comes away convinced that his account is an honest and accurate one. At a moment in our history when talk of family values is cheaper than ever, it is well worth our effort to ponder, as Mr. Gilfoyle has done, the economic necessities that have played so large a part in shaping our sexual mores, our practices and, yes, even our values.

In the Thriving Land of Fairy Tale Sales

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
Whoever said that fairy tales were really written for adults never anticipated today's children's book market. From sales of E. B. White's classic, "Charlotte's Web," to classics-in-waiting like "Tar Beach," or the best seller "Polar Express," children's books have been enjoying an almost recession-proof growth for five years. Likewise, bookstores, book clubs, wholesalers, publishing houses and even schools have been sharing in the bounty.
As millions of children think about starting school again, the publishing industry is already thinking about the winter holidays. This is when stores start stocking up for the gift-giving season, and though some retailers worry about a downturn, the industry's projected sales figures for 1992 look as upwardly mobile as ever. 
 Since 1986, publishers' net sales of children's books have doubled, to more than $1.1 billion in 1991 from $546 million, and industry studies project that sales this year may rise to $1.3 billion. That may sound like a lot of copies of "The Cat in the Hat," but in fact children's publishing has expanded way beyond its usual horizons thanks to several demographic, social and economic changes in the last decade.
First, the baby boom generation had babies. Generally older and better educated, these parents began buying books not just for pleasure but for preparation.
"Everything is for the children," said Cathy Linsk, owner of Watchung Books in Montclair, N.J., commenting on a trend she says has made parents and schools more focused on children's interests. "We even do a lot of ordering for public schools." And many in the industry say that educators and librarians are now just as likely to buy directly from a local store, often in search of books that are more culturally diverse.
"Having trade books in the classroom has opened up a huge new market," said Diane Roback, children's book editor of Publishers Weekly. Many schools are experimenting with literature-based reading programs that use storybooks instead of traditional texts. As a result, publishers' sales to children's retail stores have soared to about 40 percent from 20 percent a few years ago.
 
A New Story
Big Stores Just for Little Ones
 The most remarkable sign of this new demand is the number of children's bookstores that have sprouted across the country -- from The Treehouse in St. Cloud, Minn., to Books of Wonder in New York and Beverly Hills. Even well-known chains like Barnes & Noble and Waldenbooks now have junior chains for the junior set.
Just this month, B. Dalton Booksellers, a division of Barnes & Noble Inc., opened the first new mall store for children, called P. B. Pages. ("P. B." doesn't stand for anything, the company says.)
According to Book Industry Trends 1992, an industry sourcebook, the 76 percent growth of children's bookstores last year was second only to fast food restaurants. In 1985, there were only 215 independent children's bookstores in the country. Today there are nearly 500.
"There weren't a lot of children's books until we had that mini-baby boom," said Maureen Golden, a Barnes & Noble vice president who has expanded the company's children's departments. "Publishers started to fill the gap and we decided to give our children's sections more of an identity."
In addition to P. B. Pages, Barnes & Noble -- which has total revenues of about $892 million -- has opened 23 vast "superstores" since 1987. These stores all have B & N Jr., a children's store-within-a-store where parents can browse through some 15,000 titles shelved in brightly labeled sections. In some B & N Jr. stores kids can even attend pajama parties.
Waldenbooks, with total revenues of about $1.1 billion, also has a chain of 21 children's stores, called Waldenkids. Since these stores began catering just to children in 1987, sales have increased by about 135 percent, said Carol Baklarz, director of store operations. Both Waldenbooks and Barnes & Noble are publicly traded companies. Tower Books and Toys 'R' Us also have been expanding their children's books departments.
Some independent sellers see such expansion as a threat, though most seem to feel secure in their niche.
"Children's book sales are keeping us alive," said Ms. Linsk, whose Montclair store, which opened in November, also carries some books for grownups. "They're enabling us to maintain a nice adult selection."
Charles and Gertie Geck, an accountant and librarian respectively who live in St. Cloud, Minn., opened 12 years ago what Mr. Geck said was the first children's bookstore in the state. "Kids are definitely reading more," he said. "And they're reading books that have a lot more meat to them."
Children's books are more sophisticated now than they ever have been. The prominence of AIDS and other issues, like divorce, has brought a more open discussion of sexuality and life styles in society in general. "Daddy's Roommate," for example, is about a boy whose parents divorce and whose father then moves in with a gay lover.
 
Clubs for Kids
Spreading the Word By Mail
 Another indication of the sales trend in children's books is the rise in children's book clubs. In the last three years, both the Doubleday Book Club and the Book-of-the-Month Club started children's book clubs.
"The growth of clubs reflects the growth of independent stores," said Steven Geck, senior editor for the Children's Book-of-the-Month Club. These clubs are much like the adult clubs. Unlike the Scholastic Book Club, which is school-based, they are clubs that send catalogues out to individuals about every three weeks and offer discounts of up to 60 percent.
According to the Association of American Publishers, book club sales in 1991 were about $753 million. Though some industry studies suggest that book club sales are slipping, those clubs devoted to children's books say their sales are growing steadily. The clubs target children from the ages 2 to 12, and they typically offer thousands of titles .
"People join book clubs for different reasons than they go shopping," said Miranda DeKay, editor in chief of the Doubleday Children's Book Club, which began in 1989. "Not everyone lives near a good bookstore, and they aren't going to drive 40 miles with two toddlers. Clubs save time and money."
Scholastic is the country's oldest book club, beginning in the 1920's with classroom magazines. It caters to teachers who join the club and bring catalogues of mostly paperback, discounted books to their students. Prices range from 75 cents to $14.95.
"Part of our mission is to offer books that are affordable," said Jean Fiewel, editorial director for Scholastic Book Club and publishing company.
The club's 1991 revenues were about $150 million, about half the company's total. Scholastic publishes 400 books a year, but offers a mix of its own and other companies' books..
 
The Best Sellers
Distributors Who Even Reach Parents
 The creativity and teamwork involved in putting a children's book together, publishing it and distributing it around the country is a separate marvel.
In an industry where consumer advertising is almost unheard of and reviews are infrequent, wholesale distributors have become influential marketeers. The Ingraham Book Company, based in Nashville, is the largest of these, with six distribution centers nationwide. It has about 160,000 titles from more than 2,000 publishers, including 19,000 children's books.
Far from being just a supplier, wholesalers review a client's book needs, provide special catalogues to children's booksellers and even produce "tail spinners" -- brochures for the customers that highlight new titles. Ingraham even offers its customers a computer system for inventory analysis. Another company, Wordstock, gives a bookseller a weekly list of the top 50 best-selling children's books.
Unlike the adult market, children's best sellers typically take years to emerge, and then stay on the list for years. A publisher's backlist of older books is often more profitable than its current titles. "Charlotte's Web" is the No. 1 one best-selling paperback today, according to Publishers Weekly. It was first published by Harper & Row (now HarperCollins) 40 years ago.
 
 
TRANSLATING DR. SEUSS
 Why wait for high school for your child to learn another language when "La Gallinita Roja" (The Little Red Hen) is available now for that brilliant 3-year-old?
Mirasol, the Spanish-language division of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, started a year ago and now has translations of 12 titles from its regular list.
"There are an enormous number of children whose first language is Spanish," said Stephen Roxburgh, publisher of the children's book division who helped to start the imprint. Though several houses publish some translations, Mirasol is the only imprint for Spanish language books.
Random House, the country's largest children's book publisher, publishes many Sesame Street, Dr. Seuss and Berenstain Bear picture books in paperback for Spanish language readers.
"We're doing this in an experimental way," said Janet Schulman, publisher of books for young readers at Random House. "The Spanish-speaking market is one with large purchasing power."
Books in other languages, including French, German and Japanese, have been available for years, but the growth of the children's book market has encouraged publishers to explore different corners of the market.
"A lot of parents adopt children from other countries," said Charles Geck, co-owner of The Treehouse, a children's bookstore in St. Cloud, Minn. Mr. Geck has been surprised by the demand for books in different languages.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Senate Race;
Where Anita Hill Is the Silent Third Candidate

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Against the low drone of an air-conditioner at a roadside inn near Scranton, a dozen campaign workers sat briefing Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, on how a certain woman was threatening his bid for re-election.
One by one, they gave their reports, about how Republican women still empathized with her, about how everyone would have to work hard to convince people, given the situation, that Mr. Specter supported women's issues and how, in fact, some people were beginning to come around. 
 The woman at the top of everyone's agenda was not Lynn Yeakel, the Democratic nominee whose upset primary victory made her a household name, although her candidacy against Mr. Specter was implicit in the discussion.
The woman was Anita F. Hill, the University of Oklahoma law professor whose appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall galvanized women across the country and forced Senator Specter, the panel's lead questioner, to defend his role in the hearings while asking for people's votes.
 
Accusing Hill of Perjury
 If the now-famous scene of white men questioning a black woman about sexual harassment has come to symbolize the exclusivity of national politics, many would say that Senator Specter has, deservedly or not, come to be seen as the parliamentarian of the men's club.
His interrogation of Professor Hill, his public accusation that she perjured herself, the repeated playbacks of it in Ms. Yeakel's primary campaign commercials and the questions that now still arise about the hearings are referred to in the Specter organization as the "Anita Hill situation."
The hearings are an issue in many women's candidacies this year. But more than in any of the other campaigns, Professor Hill is, in effect, the silent third candidate in a tight race in Pennsylvania, a contest that is the closest of any to a referendum on the hearings.
"Here," said Bonnie DiCarlo, a field consultant in Pittsburgh for the Yeakel campaign, "we can actually get the man who did it."
Indeed on the campaign trail, some women clench their teeth and blurt out words like "vile" and "despicable" when asked about Senator Specter's questioning of Professor Hill. Many women said they believed Mr. Specter's tone of questioning was arrogant and patronizing.
At a meeting of the United Automobile Workers in Harrisburg, a woman asked Mr. Specter if voters could "expect more of this kind of conduct" if they re-elected him. At a reception in Scranton, faithful Republicans whispered, shamefaced, that they believed Professor Hill's accusations that Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her years before his Supreme Court nomination, when the two worked together in Government agencies.
 
Specter Confronts Issue
 Rather than ignore such anger, Senator Specter attacks it head-on. Whether he is in Pittsburgh or Gettysburg, to mine workers or homemakers, the converted or the skeptical, he brings up the hearings before anyone else can. It is an old prosecutor's strategy of getting the bad news over with.
"What I was trying to do was find out what happened between one man and one woman a long time ago," he says to each of his audiences. "It has candidly been a learning experience for me to see the depth and extent of the raw nerve that was touched by the hearings. I have learned that sexual harassment is much more widespread than I had previously thought."
He asks that he not be judged by the hearings alone. "Whatever anyone thinks of my questioning of Professor Hill, there is nobody in the Senate with a stronger record on women's issues than me."
Senator Specter is indeed viewed as one of the stronger Republican supporters of women's issues. He supports abortion rights and supported the family leave bill.
He says the Anita Hill matter is the only weapon his opponent has against him. "I start with the proposition that I have a tough race on my hands," Senator Specter said in an interview this week. "I feel bad that so many people felt such anguish over the subject."
 
'Omnipresent' Issue
 Some of his supporters says they believe he has taken an unfair beating and do not like to see him doing back flips to please critics. "He's done everything but emasculate himself," said John Minora, a Scranton lawyer and a longtime supporter of Mr. Specter.
Political analysts say he has little choice but to confront the issue. "It's there, it's omnipresent," said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University in Millersville, Pa. "He might as well bring it up. It comes up one way or another."
But this race is much more complicated than whether voters sympathized with Professor Hill or Mr. Specter. The campaign pits a moderate Republican, two-term Senator against a liberal advocate for women's issues who has never held elective office and is riding a national movement.
"People are looking for change," Ms. Yeakel said in a recent interview. "I embody change."
On the campaign trial, Mr. Specter is the master politician, slapping backs and pumping palms, never having to be reminded to acknowledge the state legislator or small-town mayor who arranged the campaign breakfast.
Ms. Yeakel is the eager newcomer who is still getting to know local organizers, still fine tuning some of her positions and who, despite growing up around politicians, still approaches campaigning with a kind of wonder, calling Mr. Specter "the ultimate scary opponent."
"This is like an out-of-body experience," she said in the interview. "It's like being in a movie. It's as if I'm watching myself and saying, 'Who is that person and what is she doing?' "
Mr. Specter's strategy has been to dismiss Ms. Yeakel as a single-issue candidate and emphasize his experience on the Appropriations Committee and his role as a Senate compromiser.
Ms. Yeakel's strategy has been to link Mr. Specter to the Hill-Thomas confrontation and to the Bush Administration, while casting herself as an agent of change in the mold of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and she never lets a speech go by without referring to "the failed policies of the Reagan-Bush-Specter era." She rarely mentions Professor Hill; she does not have to.
Both campaigns have their problems. Mr. Specter is carrying the weight not only of the hearings but of a sour economy and voter discontent with incumbents and President Bush. Most analysts say they consider the race close, although among women voters polls show Senator Specter trailing Ms. Yeakel by nearly 2 to 1.
It would not likely help Mr. Specter with women that one of his supporters, Larry Yatch, a former state Democratic chairman, was quoted in The Harrisburg Patriot-News and other newspapers as mocking Ms. Yeakel and other women with the remark, "Here, I've got breasts; vote for me."
It has been a tough few months for Ms. Yeakel as well. She is trying to define herself to voters who know her only for her advertisements linking Mr. Specter to Professor Hill and who have increasingly come to learn about her through negative reports and her own campaign missteps.
Probably her biggest gaffe was at a televised news conference in Erie last month where she stood in front of a shuttered department store and blamed the economic policies of Mr. Specter and President Reagan for its closing, only to find out later that the store had closed when Jimmy Carter was President.
Among damaging developments for Ms. Yeakel are some that could hurt her among black voters, a group that she needs badly to win in November. Senator Specter has done well with blacks in previous campaigns, winning a third of the their votes in 1980 and a fifth in 1986.
 
Specter Tries to Soften Image
 In the last few months, Ms. Yeakel has tried to deflect criticism about her affiliation with an all-white country club, to which her husband belongs and which she says she no longer visits, and segregationist stands taken by her father, Porter Hardy, when he was a Democratic Congressman from Virginia in the 1960's. He opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Mr. Specter crams his schedule with appearances before women, and he has tried to soften his image by talking more about his childhood during the Depression as the son of Russian-Polish immigrants. He has distanced himself from the Bush Administration and the Republican Party, but he has also reminded audiences of the value of experience in Washington. The other veteran Pennsylvania Senator, John Heinz 3d, died in a helicopter crash last year and was succeeded by Senator Harris Wofford, a Democrat.
The question facing both candidates as they travel the coal country and suburbs and mill towns of Pennsylvania is, will people remember the Clarence Thomas hearings, and if they do, how many votes might it cost the incumbent?
 
'His True Colors Came Out'
 There are a lot of women who feel the way Liz Bettinger, a plastics plant worker who is a ranking official in the A.F.L.-C.I.O., does: they have not been able to forgive Mr. Specter. "You look at him, and you see Anita Hill," Ms. Bettinger said. "You can say you're for women all you want, but his true colors came out."
Then there are women like Lisa Demler, an engineering consultant in Allentown, who see Mr. Specter as a good soldier just following orders. "It was a nasty job, and I wasn't proud of it," Mrs. Demler said. "But looking back, I wouldn't hold it against him."
Supporters of Mr. Specter are acutely aware of the cloud hanging over their candidate. The men and women who sat around a cramped conference table in Scranton gave reports from the front.
"There's a segment out there that, frankly, believes she was telling the truth and they're militant about it," Mr. Minora told the group. "That's the problem."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Issues -- Tort Reform;
Selling Voters on Bush, As Nemesis of Lawyers

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The President's aides have found something they think is even scarier to voters than Willie Horton: lawyers.
George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle have begun painting Bill Clinton as a captive of a special interest group, "sharp lawyers" in "tasseled loafers" who, as Mr. Bush put it in his speech to the Republican convention, are "running wild," terrorizing doctors and even Little League coaches with personal-injury suits, malpractice suits and other kinds of liability cases. 
 Many trial lawyers said they were insulted right down to their tassel-free footwear. Many, including one lawyer in New Rochelle who is seeking $5 million from Barbara Bush's stepmother in a personal-injury lawsuit, also protested that the President could not possibly have been referring to them.
 
Shoot-Out Over Liability
 The Clinton campaign has countered that it is the President who is the captive of special-interest groups, fighting consumers on behalf of insurance companies and large corporations who want to curb the average American's access to civil court and large damage awards.
As family values become a less prominent campaign issue, passed over for lack of popular demand, a battle over legal values may surface in its place. Complex issues involving the state courts, tort law and the public interest have been drawn as starkly as the plot of an old-fashioned western. But instead of cattlemen and farmers, the combatants are insurance companies and the lawyers who sue them.
Though trial lawyers view themselves as the champions of the little guy, theirs is not the kind of vocation that tugs at the heart strings of voters. "If you gave the average American a bullet and asked whether he would shoot the lawyer or the insurance company man," said James Carville, Mr. Clinton's senior campaign strategist, "you'd create a lot of angst out there."
It is hardly a secret that as a group, lawyers have an image problem. This summer, the Maritime center in Norwalk, Conn., charged visitors $7.50 to view its live shark exhibit, but lawyers were offered free admission as "a professional courtesy."
Recent public-opinion surveys suggest that Americans viscerally dislike lawyers and feel that society is, in the words of one Bush campaign focus-group participant, "sue-happy." Republican strategists say such attitudes make them increasingly confident that "tort reform," the term generally applied to any law designed to dissuade people from suing or juries from handing out generous awards, can be made a partisan campaign issue.
As Fred Steeper, a Bush poll-taker, put it rather gleefully: "Trial lawyers today have the same favorability rating as Richard Nixon in 1974."
Tort reform first surfaced as an issue in state legislatures in the 1970's, when insurance premiums for doctors, schools and drivers began skyrocketing. It crystalized as a Presidential campaign issue last year. Mr. Quayle, who as head of the President's competitiveness council has led the charge, argued that excessive litigation had forced up the cost of insurance, which in turn had forced up the costs of goods and services, causing the United States to lose its competitive edge with other industrialized countries.
 
A State Court Problem
 The Administration has been pushing for changes in Federal tort law, but in fact the vast majority of lawsuits are litigated in state courts. So most reforms lie with state legislatures, and the best any Administration can hope to contribute to the cause is moral authority. Among other things, the Administration has proposed caps on damage awards and forcing a losing plaintiff to pay legal costs.
On the political stage, however, the Bush campaign has developed an election year syllogism worthy of Ionesco: Mr. Clinton is a lawyer. Lawyers are bad. Mr. Clinton is bad.
The Bush campaign has pointed out that lawyers, as a group, have contributed twice as much to Mr. Clinton as they have to Mr. Bush. According to a recent study by the Center for Responsive Politics, Mr. Clinton has received nearly $2.6 million from lawyers and lawyer-lobbyists; Mr. Bush has received $1.3 million.
Clinton aides cite the same study's finding that Mr. Bush received more than $2.6 million from the real estate, financial and insurance industries.
 
Lawyers, Teachers and Labor
 The latest round in the battle occurred Thursday, when Vice President Dan Quayle made public a letter from the president of the Arkansas Trial Lawyers Association praising Mr. Clinton's opposition to tort reform. Mr. Quayle cited the letter as evidence that the Democratic candidate was "totally in the pocket of trial lawyers."
The Republicans have also attacked the American Bar Association as overly liberal, citing as evidence appearances at the A.B.A.'s recent national convention by Anita F. Hill and Hillary Clinton.
"The A.B.A. is a pillar of the Democratic Party, along with teachers and labor," said Jim Pinkerton, a Bush campaign adviser. "The left has an impulse to declare everyone a victim, and lawyers pounce on that."
In 1988, the Bush campaign portrayed the Democratic nominee, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis as a soft-on-crime captive of the American Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Pinkerton said that tort reform could be as potent an issue this year because it could be presented as a cause of the nation's economic troubles.
 
Issue or Diversion?
 "Everyone pays higher insurance costs," he said. "People look at the cost of a stepladder or a dose of insulin and attribute it to liability."
Mr. Clinton's advisers dismiss the talk of tort reform as a diversion. "I don't think average voters think litigation has put a stanglehold on the American economy," Mr. Carville said. "I think people think Mr. Bush's economic policies are responsible for the stranglehold."
And from Park Avenue to Houston, lawyers in wingtips and cowboy boots are defending their honor. "Tort reform is just code for closing the courthouse door to poor people," said Joseph D. Jamail Jr., a Texas trial lawyer. Mr. Jamail is widely known as the King of Torts for winning a $10 billion award for Pennzoil in its suit against Texaco -- 40 times the largest amount previously awarded in an American damage suit.
 
Lawyers May Fight Back
 Robert MacCrate, a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell, and a former president of the American Bar Association, said of the Republican pressure, "It offends me, but I feel the attacks are so specious and distorted that they can only redound to the detriment of the accuser."
The American Bar Association is not so sure. It has hired a Washington consulting firm to help restore its image. "They want to fight back," said Tim Ridley, a consultant with the Communications Company, a division of the political consulting firm, Squier, Eskew, Knapp and Ochs Communications, which is advising Mr. Clinton.
"They want the Administration to know they are not the fifth column of the Democratic Party," Mr. Ridley said, adding that only about a third of the A.B.A.'s members are Democrats, with the rest either Republicans or independents.
Tort reform is not entirely a partisan issue. Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, has spoken out in favor it. Mr. Clinton supports a few limited measures, such as voluntary alternative dispute resolutions. And despite the opposition of consumer advocates like Ralph Nader, some longtime liberals favor it.
And Charles Peters, editor of the Washington Monthly, while agreeing with Mr. Quayle that "Democrats have sold out to the trial lawyers lobby," also believes that Republicans have taken the right stand for the wrong reasons.
Faulting the President and Mr. Quayle for not demanding concessions from doctors, hospitals and insurance companies, he said sternly: "I consider it completely accidental that the Republicans have embraced the cause of virtue."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
Alien Terrain Replaces What Was Once Home

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., Aug. 30

 BODY:
It was the trees that so many people spoke of.
In the midst of the devastation, the privations and the pain, the people of Homestead last week sometimes stopped, mid-conversation, and remarked on a pine tree that had grown with them, an acacia that was a benchmark for their lives, a towering mangrove that was a testament to their own struggles, achievements and now loss. 
 They spoke of the scent of the leaves, the shape of a particular trunk or crown, the shade from the burning South Florida sun and the stretches of green that had made Homestead special. All gone.
They pointed, disconsolately, at groves of fruit trees -- lime, avocado, mango and star fruit -- that were literally lifted up from fields to the east and deposited, roots skyward, to the west like a lost scene from "The Wizard of Oz."
As they gazed dully at a landscape transformed, they said that they could hardly find their way around. Street signs and shop signs were reduced to scraps of steel and flecks of paint. Even buildings were barely recognizable skeletons of wood and steel. Residents interrupted themselves with a start as they tried to give directions. With looks of befuddlement they would pause and apologize: "Oh. That's gone. My landmarks are gone. I don't know how to tell you where to go."
With so many trees down, the hulks of houses, buildings and other new focal points suddenly stood out against the desolate landscape. Even the animals were wind-shocked, easily spooked, yet drifting close, as though encouraged to find fellow survivors.
 
Lost Parrots and Broken Cars
 Few wars or acts of God have ever had this fury. In a matter of hours, in the dark before dawn, the winds of Hurricane Andrew swept through southern Dade County on Monday and took Homestead off the map. This is the story of the town that was, of what it has lost, and what it may eventually become again as residents, shop owners, retirees, farmers and fruit growers try to piece themselves back together after what may be the most destructive natural disaster in America's history.
Every corner of the Homestead region knew a tragedy. Rising to speeds of 150 miles an hour, the winds wiped out Ken Kwan's $100,000 worth of tropical parrots and drove the door right off its hinges even though five people stood inside, their weight pitched hard against the force.
In Leisure City, a town just northeast of Homestead, the winds blew the aluminum siding from the Air Base hangars and sent them flying like razor blades. Cars were sliced in half, and steel sheets sat the next morning impaled like knife blades in concrete walls and wooden siding. Few could have imagined the force. No one had ever seen anything like it.
In the Redlands, an area of fields and fruit groves north of Homestead, a huge truck lay a distance of two football fields back from the road, tipped on its side in the middle of a bean field.
Over at the Americana Village Estates mobile home park off Krome Avenue at 180th Avenue, residents showed off the littered, sodden remains of new furniture and expensive carpet and pointed to where walls and roofs used to be. Old photographs of better times and well-tended gardens exchanged hands.
They talked of the closeness the neighborhood enjoyed, the park's swimming pool and club house, the Monday night bingo games, the Tuesday ceramic classes and the long morning runs down rural roads that stand like a grid among the groves of the Redlands.
Eva Serrano, a native of Hoboken, N.J., who lived in mobile home lot 265, cried as she spoke of a daughter who had died of brain cancer in 1978. For years, she said, she had saved her daughter's bedroom set as something to remember her by.
It was shredded in the wind when the east wall of her mobile home trailer blew away and the rest of her home was demolished.
"My sister's home is gone," she said flatly. "My mother's home is gone. My brother's home is gone. We can't stay here now, because now there are rats."
Homestead residents started burning the debris from their demolished houses and toppled trees today, and huge plumes of black smoke rose above the town and could be seen and smelled as far away as downtown Miami. Rain teemed for the second straight day, soaking furniture and clothes that residents had tried so hard to dry.
The rain brought another problem, as clouds of mosquitoes rose from the damp ground, bringing with them the threat of disease. Those houses that were left standing had no wire screens to keep the insects out.
For some, the hurricane was only the beginning of a chain reaction of troubles. Carmen Rivera Myers and her husband, William, survived the storm by moving into their daughter's house in Princeton, several miles to the northeast. They went back to Homestead on Tuesday to find the roof of their apartment building demolished but their own home hardly damaged.
Then the rains came.
At 2 A.M. Sunday, in a downpour, they were awakened by the sound of their living room ceiling caving in.
"We got up," said Mrs. Rivera Myers. "We ran to see what the sound was. The ceiling had collapsed. And while we stood there, the bedroom ceiling went, too. Now our place is completely demolished. We have lost everything."
Tonight, Mrs. Rivera Myers was bunking in a stuffy, overcrowded room at Homestead Middle School. Her husband, who has been unemployed since November 1991, stayed in the ruined apartment with a gun, watching over their remaining possessions. Already, bands of thieves had moved through the apartment building, carting off what they could and siphoning gas from cars in the lot.
Settling back on a small cot and hoping to get her first good sleep in six days, Mrs. Rivera Myers said the apartment had become a hazard. Food was rotting everywhere, and the standing water they had left before the storm had already gone bad.
Like many others she saw a reason in the disaster: to cleanse a town she said was already headed down the wrong track. After the hurricane, she said, her son had taken her on a drive through Leisure City. "All he did was point and say, over and over, that is a crack house, that is a crack house," she said. "Maybe this will clean our town up. I pray."
 
A Town of Fertile Land And Fickle Fortunes
 Homestead is a multilingual city of about 27,000 just 30 miles south of Miami. But it is a state of mind, too, for residents who use the name to speak loosely of a broader swath of land that includes the Homestead Air Force Base to the east, the fields and fruit groves of the Redlands inland, to the northwest, and the last-chance hotels and restaurants that are strung along U.S. 1 for tourists heading south to the Keys.
As residents sifted through the rubble that covered the ground for miles in all directions last week, they spoke of the region's charms, its problems and its idiosyncrasies. They said it was just another town along the road, really; a "mudhole" of a town, a town for "rednecks," one that has seen good times both come and go.
Built by immigrants and newcomers from other states who for the last 80 years came for the sun, it has shrunk and grown by turns, following the twists of fortune that attended every crop failure, bad storm or economic slump. Even the Air Force base, the biggest employer and biggest customer around, was destroyed once before by a hurricane, in 1945, and then rebuilt.
Blessed with a climate that nurtures crops of all kinds, Homestead is cursed, too, with the fickleness of that climate and the vagaries of the tourist trade. Even before the hurricane, the persistent recession had already choked off visitors' dollars and left the place waiting for better times.
It was a town for gamblers of one sort or another, with a thriving illegal drug trade, a mosaic of ethnic groups, a deep bitterness toward Washington. People say, perhaps overstating the case a bit, that there are more guns than people here.
Farming, fruit and the cocaine trade made for the largest fortunes. Smaller ones were the work of ingenuity, pluck and imagination. It was a sprawling place with a small-town feel where the rodeo each February had all the government employees going to work in cowboy hats or frilly dresses.
Somewhere in the ruins of what this place once was, there lies a road map of what it might have been. There is a bicycle velodrome on that map, an equestrian park and an Olympic shooting range. "We had a lot of plans," said Maj. Charles Habermehl, a mustached, plain-talking officer with the Homestead Police Department who has been working nearly around the clock as the operations commander for the emergency. "But forget about the velodrome when you don't even have any buildings standing."
Some projects were already completed. Most are now gone or in need of so much repair that they might as well be. The town's community pavilion, once the site of boxing matches, clog-dancing demonstrations, huge family reunions and the rodeo, was blown to pieces. The Homestead Sports Complex, which had recently housed some of the trials for the Olympic baseball team, was badly damaged, too.
All week, residents struggled for a way to describe what they saw. Veterans spoke of war. Others said only a nuclear holocaust could have such impact. Some merely repeated, over and over on the first days, that nothing could have prepared them for this.
The Air Base was virtually totaled. So were entire city blocks. Almost no structure came through unscathed. But the damage was selective, almost capricious. One house might stand intact next to a dozen fragments made of a wall here, a piece of flooring there. Amid a junkyard's worth of debris is a refrigerator, bolt upright, the food rotting inside it. Most areas looked as though they had suffered enemy shelling for weeks. Some, like the Quail Roost trailer park in Redlands, were smashed end to end into uncountable pieces.
 
Under the Palms, Living Was Never Very Easy
 To give homeless families a decent place to rest, Jessie Hanna, a 26-year-old maintenance worker with a Howard Johnson's hotel on U.S. 1, has been cleaning up debris in the ravaged hotel, which has one of the few working phones in the area but still lacks electricity and running water. His own house, an $80,000 home across from the air base, was gone, he said, nothing more than heaps of wood and litter. The only rooms left standing were the laundry and the garage.
"I worked so hard trying to accomplish something, and now I don't have it," he said as he took a break on a water-soaked chair on the terrace of a first-floor room.
Mr. Hanna said that he and his wife, Dorothy, who is 39 and works at a retirement home in Cutler Ridge, would somehow pick up and start over. He was fond of the town. "Our big thing was palm trees," he said. "It was like Hawaii."
Homestead's particular story, like any town's, cannot be told by a mere aggregation of facts and figures. But there are plenty of numbers: an average per capita income of $9,700, compared with $14,600 for the state; 15 percent of the population at work in agriculture, forestry and fishing; another 14 percent working in construction with farmland increasingly giving way to developments; the balance at the air base, unemployed or working in private businesses, real estate, the tourism industry or whatever could be found.
After Eastern Airlines shut down last year and dumped another load of newly unemployed workers into the struggling economy, men and women who once made more than $30,000 a year -- pretty good money here -- were looking for retail jobs paying minimum wage. Something in the town was going sour. Yet the immigrants kept coming and the hardships kept on growing.
Some, like Mr. Hanna, still made a good life and looked forward to the future. "I was feeling good about myself," he said. "But now I have to start all over. I came here today to work. But my mind isn't right. I'm not in the groove for it. I can't get myself back."
Homestead was incorporated in 1913, nine years after a south Florida railroad line tied it to markets to the north. The flatlands were transformed from a backwoods filled with snakes, wildcats and otter into a livable place with the flavor of the frontier.
Though in the past several years Homestead had been spruced up with some expensive homes and new downtown facades, a certain grittiness always remained. For every majestic royal palm on the repaved downtown blocks along Krome Avenue, there were just as many hard-luck neighborhoods. Homestead has always been a little lost between the bright lights of Miami and the breeziness of the Keys. But last week the isolation hurt. Homeowners who had lost everything said with bitterness that the slowness of the disaster relief effort was only to be expected. "They always forget about us," said Major Habermehl.
The major, who emphasized that he was a solid Republican, complained nonetheless that President Bush, in his tour of the area Monday, went no farther south than Cutler Ridge, a heavily damaged town to the north that is more of a Miami suburb.
"We never count on anyone," he said. "It's just that way. But this time, I kind of take it personally."
 
Thoughts of Renewal In a Foreign Landscape
 By midweek, as the first of the relief airlifts arrived and the thwack of helicopters was all around, the farmers and grove owners had walked their acres and assessed the damage. Rosario Strano, a second-generation Italian-American tomato farmer, stood in front of his house and pointed with amazement at a red house down the road.
"All these years," he said, "and I have never seen that house before." The view was clear. Every tree around the place was flat.
At the fruit packing house of J. R. Brooks and Sons Inc. business limped ahead at a bare fraction of capacity. Neal Palmer Brooks, the concern's affable 53-year-old owner, surveyed the damage.
His fields were insured by Lloyd's of London. He is confident that his family's venture will spring back despite losses to most of his groves and most of his packing operation. But he is worried that other growers will give up. Mr. Brooks had already responded to market pressures by expanding his operations into Costa Rica and the Bahamas. "My company will go on," he said. "But if we lose a lot of growers we will lose all their experience, their training, their knowledge and their feel for this. Just look around. The groves blew out of the ground. They blew across the road. They blew down the road. They are stacked up like tumbleweed against the fences. Gone."
Gone, too, from the hidden groves to the once busy downtown, were the signposts of the night. No street lights pierced the darkness, no flickering televisions in living rooms or neon signs. After dark, when the curfew fell and the streets cleared and men stood on porch fronts, guarding whatever they had left with loaded guns, only the red glow of flares set up near National Guard encampments broke a curtain of pure black. The trees were gone, and looking up one saw a glittering canopy of stars, brilliant and mute against the eerie silence down in Homestead.

HEADLINE: California Legislature Passes Budget With Big Cuts

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug. 30

 BODY:
The two-month-long fiscal crisis in California has moved closer to conclusion with the passage of an austere recession-era budget package that cuts deeply into health and welfare services and state support for colleges, cities and counties.
The State Assembly passed the main $57 billion budget bill on Saturday evening after an impassioned speech by Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. urging colleagues to pass the bill even though it closely resembled the no-new-taxes budget favored by his main political rival, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
 The State Senate had passed the measure by a wide margin early Saturday after its Democratic leaders reached an accord with the Republican Governor. The vote in the Democratic-controlled Assembly was much closer: with a two-thirds vote necessary for passage, the budget passed, 54 to 23.
Though the Assembly has not yet acted on the crucial bills that would carry out spending cuts necessitated by the budget, the votes appeared to signal the end of the budget impasse that has all but paralyzed the state government and threatened the poor and disabled with loss of health care and other services. The Assembly planned to take up the bills late today.
 
Cutting Aid to Cities
 Unable to bridge a $10.7 billion budget gap, the state has been paying its bills with i.o.u.'s since July 1, and many health programs for the poor and old are on the verge of closing.
The new budget would cut $1.3 billion from the $2.9 billion that the state would have normally given to cities, counties and special fire-fighting and other districts; reduce money for regional centers for the retarded; cut support for the University of California and the California State University systems by $402 million; double fees at community colleges, and delay the opening of two new prisons.
It would maintain support for public schools, but only with complex bookkeeping acrobatics devised by Governor Wilson that "recapture" $1.1 billion in excess money paid to schools last year and then "lend" them money from future years for this year. The schools would be expected to repay the money in better times. This measure is bitterly opposed by teachers' unions and school administrators.
Isolated by the agreement between the Senate leadership and Governor Wilson, the 80-member Assembly yielded out of frustration and weariness.

Specter of the Storm
Damage from Hurricane Andrew to natural gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico will cut production for several weeks, until repairs are completed. Prices for gas contracts rose sharply on Friday, and analysts predicted that customers in the Northeast and Midwest would see bigger heating bills this winter. In addition, some analysts said Andrew's ravages may have ended a long depression in the natural gas market. [Page D1.]
Top executives of large insurance companies toured Florida municipalities where almost all property had become a casualty of the hurricane. Several said the damage was more intense than anything they had ever seen, and the faces of corporate leaders from Allstate, State Farm, Prudential, Aetna and other companies turned expressionless at the destruction. [D1.] 
 The nation's lime crop was largely destroyed. Most of the trees were stripped of fruit and leaves, and others were toppled. [D4.]
The hurricane devastation in Miami created havoc for television stations. Worst hit was WCIX, which is owned by CBS. [D6.]
 
The Economy
A sure way for the nation to increase its output is to provide more education, a group of often-bickering economists agreed at a weekend meeting in Wyoming. [D8.]
Japan's huge economic rescue package is the type of powerful stimulus that Washington policy makers wish they could adopt. But pressured by the budget deficit, Bush Administration officials feel too hemmed in to embrace a huge pump-priming program that could increase it by $50 billion or more. [D1.]
The nation's retailers report that sales of notepads, sneakers, lunch pails and pens recovered a bit of their old buoyancy as students prepared to head back to school. [D2.]
Machine tool orders fell 2.8 percent in July, reflecting a sharp drop in orders from foreign customers, a trade group said. [D3.]
 
International
 Analysts generally praised the Japanese Government's economic rescue package as a good start in restoring public confidence. But they also say it represents the abandonment of an important pledge: to bring the country's astronomical land prices down. News Analysis. [D8.]
The cost of traveling in Europe is pinching Americans this summer as the dollar's value plunges. [A4.]
 
Companies

U.S. Tourist Dollar Paying a Value-Deleted Tax

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Robert Hite of Denver sat on a bench outside the Tower of London (admission price: $13), munching on his cheapest meal in days, a quarter-pounder from McDonald's ($3.25), and running over the expenses he has incurred during his family's vacation in England.
"The one that really sticks in my mind was the ice cream," he said, sitting alongside his wife, Joanne, and his son, Cass. "We went into a place in Salisbury and had an ice cream, and it was $6 a bowl. That really got to me." 
 The cost of traveling in Europe is getting to a lot of Americans this summer. The prices of almost everything in Western Europe tend to be sharply higher than in the United States even in normal times, but in recent weeks, as the value of the dollar has dropped precipitously relative to the world's other major currencies, the shock to American travelers has been particularly severe.
In Britain over the last several days, the pound has cost about $2.10 after factoring in the commission charged by most banks and money-exchange centers. That reflects a decline in the dollar's value of about 8 percent in a matter of weeks, and it is a far cry from the mid-1980's, when the value of the pound flirted for a time with $1.
 
$25 for a Pair of Socks
 Those were the days when airlines in the United States advertised weekend shopping trips to London, touting the bargains travelers could find. The other day, seeking not a bargain but just the fun of shopping in one of the world's great department stores, Mrs. Hite visited Harrods.
"I walked right out without buying anything," she said. "I thought I'd buy a pair of socks, just so I could say I'd gotten something there, but it was $25. For a pair of socks!"
There are economic advantages to the United States of a weak dollar, most notably the help it gives to companies that export their products, which become less expensive to foreign buyers. And if the cost of tourism for Americans in Europe is exorbitant, it is extremely attractive for Europeans who want to visit the United States while their pounds, marks and francs have so much purchasing power.
British tour operators have begun offering cut-rate Christmas-shopping trips to New York. British Airways, for example, is offering round-trip air fare and two nights in a hotel for the equivalent of about $580 for people traveling between Nov. 1 and Dec. 12. Some of the offers have been promoted so aggressively that customs authorities here felt compelled recently to issue a statement warning that all purchases brought into the Britain were subject to duties and fees including the 17.5 percent value-added tax, a levy that cuts deeply into any cost savings.
But trade patterns and the vicissitudes of the foreign-exchange markets are not foremost on the minds of most Americans in Europe. For them, there seems to be a simple rule: assume that everything could cost twice as much as in the United States, and do not be surprised if it is even more. While many of them said they had been prepared for the high cost of hotels, they said they were taken aback by the price of food, sightseeing admissions, souvenirs and the other incidentals that can eat away rapidly at their traveler's checks.
 
Fewer U.S. Visitors
 Scott Blake Harris, a lawyer from Washington, brought his wife, Barbara, and their son, Colin, with him to England on a business trip, so many of his expenses were paid for. Still, he said as they stared up at Big Ben, the trip had been "shockingly" expensive.
"The last time I was here it was about $1.25 to the pound, and now the dollar is worth nothing," he said. A quick meal of pizza and spaghetti cost them $35. "It's affecting the way we're eating," he said, only half-jokingly. "Less."
Hotels and tour-bus operators said the number of American visitors this summer appeared to be down significantly, a finding confirmed by a quick stop at any major tourist site, where in the babble of languages, American English can be heard relatively infrequently.
Those who have come are clearly trying to work themselves into a state of fiscal stoicism.
"We knew it was coming and it's still shocking," said Stan Davis of Lawrence, Kan., as he stood outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, where watching the guards remains free. He and his wife and their two children just arrived here for three months while he teaches law at University College, London, and they said they were already adapting to the unexpected costs.
"What's not going to happen is eating out a lot," Mr. Davis said. His wife, Linda, said they would be able to get by without much trouble, but only if they learned where to shop most inexpensively and generally kept their outlays down. "It's like New York with a bad rate of exchange," Mrs. Davis said.
 
No Plans to Return

The best strategy for coping, some tourists said, is trying not to compute the cost in dollars of each expenditure mentally. "Look, if you go on vacation and you have to spend a few more dollars, so what?" said Bertha Kaplan of Manhattan as she stood outside Westminster Abbey. But she could not resist noting that she had just paid $14 for a small guide book.
"This is the opportunity of a lifetime and we're going to enjoy ourselves," said Scott Ripper of Brookfield, Ill., as he stood outside the Tower of London. "Yeah, the Tower costs $13 each, but if you go to Disneyland it costs $30 and you don't get the incredible history you get here."
Still, Mr. Ripper added, "we're not going to be coming back here next year, that's for sure."
Mrs. Hite said that despite the expense they were still seeing all the sights they had planned on, and that the trip had been enjoyable.
"But you know, though we didn't set a budget, we never expected to spend everything we brought with us," she said. "Guess what? We're going to."

HEADLINE: Economists Put Forth Plans to Stimulate Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 30

 BODY:
For two days, an all-star cast of economists gathered in the Rocky Mountains here to search for their Holy Grail: a formula to reverse the trend in which growth in the industrial world has slowed decade by decade since World War II.
If the often-bickering economists were able to forge a consensus on anything, it was that providing more education is a sure way for a nation to increase its output. 
 Time and again, the economists stressed the importance of improving "human capital," meaning that a better-educated, better-trained work force can lift a nation's growth rate.
"Human capital can be important for research and development and for adapting technologies from other countries," said Robert J. Barro, an economics professor at Harvard University.
 
Effect on Output
 If an industrial nation raised the average amount of schooling for its population by one year, he said, output per capita would increase three-tenths of 1 percent a year. If sub-Saharan countries increased the average level of schooling, currently two years, by one year, he said, output would grow by seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Mr. Barro and some 50 other economists, who ranged from hard right conservatives to moderate liberals, came to Jackson Hole for a conference, "Policies for Long-Term Economic Growth," which was sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
During breaks from hiking in the Rockies and rafting down the Snake River, the conferees produced a potpourri of proposals that included tax incentives to increase America's anemic savings rate, a consumption tax to encourage investment over consumer spending, and reintroducing an investment tax credit for machinery and equipment to increase productivity.
 
Most Popular Theme
 But of the many disparate proposals, improving human capital emerged as the conference's most popular theme.
Lawrence F. Katz, another Harvard economist, supported Mr. Barro's conclusions, saying an improved work force is often accompanied by increased physical investment by business, which helps spur productivity and growth. Countries that tend to invest more money in improving their work force than in physical investment, like factories or machinery, he said, tend to have a fairer distribution of income.
"One can view human capital investment as win-win," Mr. Katz said. "It is associated with greater growth and better distribution of the pie."
 
The Case for Machinery
 He noted that people with more education tended to have fewer children and that this helps to raise output and productivity per capita. Children in countries with low fertility rates generally receive more education than those from high-fertility nations.
In another paper at the conference, two other Harvard economists -- Harvard dominated the conference with six professors on hand -- contended that it was important for countries to invest more in machinery and equipment. These professors, Lawrence H. Summers and J. Bradford De Long, said investment in machinery had far greater returns than investments in other areas, like buildings, because machinery helped disseminate new technologies and push workers to upgrade their skills.
"Equipment investment is much more likely to promote technological change and be a carrier of technological change," said Mr. Summers. Mr. De Long estimated that there was a 30 to 40 percent return on investment in machinery, with half going to companies and half to societies.
Several speakers urged the United States Government to subsidize spending on machinery by establishing an investment tax credit. They said this would help offset subsidies that favor investments in areas that do not enhance productivity, like housing.
But Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns and a member of the Reagan Administration, attacked these calls for favoring certain categories of investment. "We would be in great error if we go back to a more planned-economy approach," he said, asserting that faster growth would result from lower taxes, less regulation and less Government intervention in the economy.
 
Creating Distortions
 Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, argued that it would be wrong to establish subsidies for machinery, asserting that the wide range of tax subsidies, including mortgage interest deductions for homeowners, distort investment and make the economy less efficient.
He said Washington could spur long-term growth by shifting spending away from areas that do little for productivity. He cited farm subsidies and the Government's spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on medical care for people in the last six months of their lives.
"Our problem is shifting resources from wasteful uses to more productive uses," he said. "The Government spends too much foolishly and not enough wisely."
Professor Meltzer stressed that free trade was crucial for faster growth. He pointed to studies showing that developing countries that embrace free trade gain new technologies faster and develop industries that can better withstand foreign competition.
Numerous speakers called on Government to embrace measures that encourage investments that raise productivity. "In the choice between savings incentives and investment incentives, we should choose investment incentives," said Alan J. Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
He said incentives aimed at spurring savings -- the capital that finances investments -- are an inefficient way to increase investments that enhance productivity. The increased savings resulting from tax incentives, he said, might be invested overseas or used to build housing.
Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist who is president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, disagreed, saying more needs to be done to raise America's anemic savings rate.
"Our net savings rate is just 2 percent of gross domestic product," he said. "It's off the charts in international comparisons of savings rates. In the long run domestic investment is constrained by low domestic savings."
 
Importance of Inflation
 Several economists said low inflation was important for raising long-term productivity and economic growth, since high inflation distorts prices, worries investors and often slows capital spending. The paper by Professors Summers and De Long pointed to evidence that countries with highly independent central banks -- those willing to shun political pressures and adopt tight money policies to crack down on inflation -- enjoy faster productivity growth than other nations.
Professor Summers and Professor Auerbach said the United States could raise long-term growth by substantially increasing investment. Mr. Auerbach said that raising growth by a full percentage point a year would require a 50 percent increase in investment a year. Vastly increasing investment would require a sharp shift away from consumption spending on everything from camcorders to medical care to baseball game tickets.
"Prosperity tomorrow requires sacrifice today," said N. Gregory Mankiw, another Harvard professor. "It is a rare politician who is willing to be the bearer of such truths."

HEADLINE: Tracking the Back-to-School Bounce

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Peppering their cautious assessments with a variety of caveats, the nation's retailers report that sales of notepads, sneakers, lunch pails and pens have recovered a bit of their old buoyancy this month as students prepare to head back to school.
But while they appreciate any sign that sales are regaining at least a small semblance of normalcy, many retailers no longer worry if they fail to get a significant bounce from the back-to-school season. Normalcy, they say, has undergone an evolution. 
 Once the harbinger of the Christmas season to follow, when retailers earn the bulk of their profits, the back-to-school season no longer serves as the merchant's crystal ball. Changes in school calendars and shopping patterns, as well as the ability to replenish inventory in three or four days, have diminished the importance of August on the retail calendar, retailers and analysts say.
 
More Sales in the Fall Now
 "We used to use August as the bellwether of critical fourth-quarter sales, but now August sales are pushed into September and even October," said Janet Magnano, a retail analyst at Burnham Securities. "The business has become more evenly distributed than it used to be."
The sluggish economy is intensifying the shift, as financially strapped consumers are choosing to buy things when they need them instead of on a seasonal basis, said Mike Searles, president of Kids "R" Us, the children's clothing division of Toys "R" Us.
Of course, the weeks before school are still critical for stores like Mr. Searles's, which primarily sell children's clothing or stationery. "This is our Christmas right now," he said.
Retailers also say sales have spread out because students postpone their back-to-school buying until they see what their peers are wearing, pushing sales further into the fall. And as merchants become better able to control their inventory, they buy less, knowing that they can replenish their stocks quickly if the need arises.
Gary Prushansky, director of marketing for the Bic Corporation, which does a booming business in pens this time of year, said retailers placed their orders later this year and bought only for the back-to-school season. In previous years, retailers bought more Bic pens than they expected to sell during back-to-school to take advantage of special pricing promotions Bic has for the season.
Despite retailers' caution, Mr. Prushansky said Bic would record strong sales gains. Instead of keeping stock in the warehouse, retailers have been using computerized technology to replace merchandise.
"Everybody has a way of doing business now that works on having less inventory," Mr. Prushansky said.
Such strict controls on inventory should help retailers avoid the price cuts that have been used during the recession to stimulate sales at the expense of profit margins, analysts say. The prudent strategy may serve them well, given low levels of consumer confidence and income growth.
 
A Later Labor Day
 This year's late Labor Day weekend, which falls a week after it did last year, will further emphasize the new trend. Most back-to-school buying occurs in the week before and the week after the holiday, and many retailers say sales were drowsier than normal in the first two weeks of August.
"More back-to-school spending will fall in September than usual," said Orren F. Knauer, vice president of investor relations at the Kmart Corporation. "But even without the late Labor Day, spending patterns around back-to-school have changed." As a result, he said, Kmart's August sales growth is likely to be somewhat less than the increase it posted in July, traditionally a slow sales month, while September sales will probably surge.
More fundamental changes to the calendar include year-round school in a growing number of school districts, particularly in Florida and California, where several chains have strong presences. And even in school districts that operate on a more traditional calendar, some start before Labor Day while others wait until it has passed. In some school districts in Texas, for example, school started the third week of August, while in Minnesota, schools open after the holiday.
"We're doing well, although probably not as well as we had expected up to this point," said Gary Vasques, senior vice president for marketing at Caldor, a chain of discount stores in the Northeast. "But we feel that with the late Labor Day and lots of schools waiting to open till after that, it's going to come in September."
 
The Safe Staple
 Denim is de rigueur and school supplies with an environmental conscience are staples in every backpack. Products featuring characters on the hit television show "Beverly Hills 90201" are still best sellers, as are spinoffs from movies like "Beauty and the Beast" and "Batman Returns."
Sales of denim, Mr. Vasques says, regardless of color or style, were rocketing far beyond the company's plans, a trend echoed by other retailers.
Blue jeans and denim shirts and anything with Western accents like fringe are best sellers at stores across the country. "When the economy is unstable or a little rocky, Western becomes a fashion force because it's a safe, staple American look," explains Carol Edwards, publicity manager for men's and children's merchandising at J. C. Penney.
Overall sales have increased over last year, but have still fallen short of expectations. "From what I understand, so far August hasn't exactly been a barn-burner," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, an industry newletter. "It's definitely better than last year, but frankly I think most retailers were anticipating even more than that."
In a survey of 600 mothers by Tactical Retail Solutions, a New York-based retail consulting firm, almost 60 percent said they planned to spend the same amount of money on back-to-school clothes and supplies as they did last year. Almost 30 percent said they would spend more, while 13.6 percent said they would spend less.
"We expect that to translate into moderately positive sales gains among discounters and category killers like Kids 'R' Us," said Isaac Lagnado, principal of the firm. "But traditional department stores are not likely to get much of a bounce from back-to-school spending."

HEADLINE: Hurricane Ruins Much of Lime Crop

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Count the nation's lime crop as another casualty of Hurricane Andrew. An estimated 95 percent of America's limes come from the hard-hit area of Florida's southern Dade County, near the town of Homestead.
State officials and citrus growers who have toured the area say the lime crop is destroyed. Most of the trees were stripped of fruit and leaves, they say, and others were toppled. 
 "It looked horrible, like someone had taken a chainsaw to most of the trees," said Larry Murray, vice president of sales for Indian River Foods, an orange and grapefruit processor, who drove through the Homestead area on Thursday.
 
Some Crops Unharmed
 Still, Florida's big citrus industry was largely spared by the hurricane. The crucial region for orange and grapefruit crops, covering about 700,000 acres, was to the north of Andrew's path.
"It was a tightly wound hurricane in Florida, cutting a 35-mile wide path of destruction," said Bobby F. McKown, executive vice president of Florida Citrus Mutual, a cooperative representing most of the state's citrus growers. "So while it hit the lime crop, it was pretty much a nonevent for the citrus industry as a whole."
In the main citrus-growing regions, Andrew had no more effect than a "normal thunderstorm," Mr. McKown said.
Florida's lime crop is valued at $20.3 million a year. But the bigger financial loss to southern Dade County's agricultural economy will come from the damage to the house-plant industry, said Robert Freie, the Florida statistician for the Federal Agriculture Department. The state's $150-million-a-year house-plant industry is centered in southern Dade County.
 
Mexican Limes Differ
 Lime prices are set to jump, because roughly 60 percent of American consumption is produced in Florida. Most of the imports come from Mexico. Moreover, Florida-grown limes are the larger, seedless Persian variety, while most of the imports are Key limes, which are smaller and have more seeds.
"I expect the price to bounce a couple of dollars a box by next week," said Henry Hubner, manager of the Hahn Food Products Corporation, a fruit wholesaler in the Bronx. Mr. Hubner buys the limes he sells to restaurants and hotels in boxes of about five dozen. He said that last week he paid about $8.50 a box.
Yet higher lime prices, or even scarcity of the preferred variety, should not have too much effect on American consumers. At Gallagher's Steak House in Manhattan, where up to 200 gin and tonics (with lime) are served on a busy night, Leo Bennett, a bartender, said: "It shouldn't affect the price of a drink. And even if they have to switch from limes to lemons, most gin and tonic drinkers will suffer through."
Harold E. Kendall Jr., the vice president of the Kendall Foods Corporation in Gould, Fla., whose products include limes and avocados, said: "We've gone through this before, and we'll be back. After all, we have a solemn duty to provide limes for all the gin and tonics in the world."

HEADLINE: Weak Foreign Demand Depresses Tool Orders

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools fell 2.8 percent in July, reflecting the weakness among foreign customers that plagues several sectors of the United States economy, according to a report to be released today by an industry trade group.
The trade group, the Association of Manufacturing Technology, tallied last month's orders at $205.6 million, down from the $211.5 million of orders in June. But compared with orders a year earlier, the July figure was up 6.4 percent. 
 Domestic orders for machine tools grew by 3 percent in July to $180.6 million, the trade group said, but the month's gain was more than offset by a sharp drop in foreign orders, which slumped 31.5 percent to $25 million.
 
Indicator of Economic Health
 Machine tool orders are monitored by economists as one indicator of the nation's economic health. July's results served as another reminder that a United States economic recovery faces an obstacle in the weak economies of Europe and Japan, where buying of American products is down.
Although the dollar's steady fall this year has made American products more attractive overseas, economists have expressed concern that auto, aircraft and computer exports, among others, would be affected by lower purchasing power abroad.
On the bright side, the association said that so far this year machine tool orders totaled $1.47 billion, up 8 percent from the similar period of 1991. Domestic orders during that time were up 25 percent, to $1.28 billion.
"Every month this year domestic orders have been ahead of the same month in 1991," Albert W. Moore, president of the Association of Manufacturing Technology, said in a statement. "This continued pickup of orders is a positive sign."
Machine tool orders were relatively steady at the start of the year, climbed to $242.8 million in March and then dropped to $219 million in April and to $159.2 million in May. Orders rebounded to a revised total of $211.5 million in June, earlier reported as $208.6 million.
Shipments of machine tools, which are often lower than orders because some orders are canceled, slid 23.1 percent in July to $184.3 million, compared with June. Shipments fell 13.4 percent compared with July 1991. For the first seven months of 1992, total shipments of machine tools fell 5.6 percent to $1.44 billion.
In specific tool categories, orders for metal-cutting tools grew 6.4 percent in July from the previous month, to $154.9 million, and were up 7.7 percent compared with July 1991.
Shipments of metal-cutting tools dropped by 17.3 percent, to $133.4 million, compared with June, and by 10.7 percent compared with July 1991. Shipments of metal-cutting tools for the year to date are virtually even with last year's pace.
Orders for metal-forming machine tools slipped 23 percent to $50.8 million, compared with the previous month, but jumped 6.5 percent compared with July 1991. Shipments of metal-forming machine tools dropped by 35 percent to $50.9 million compared with June, and by 19.7 percent compared with July 1991.

HEADLINE: Tokyo-Style Plan Too Costly for U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 30

 BODY:
The Japanese Government's huge new economic rescue package, aimed at catapulting Japan out of its worrisome slump, is the type of powerful stimulus package that Washington policy makers wish they could adopt.
But pressured by the $350 billion Federal budget deficit, Bush Administration officials feel too hemmed in to embrace a huge pump-priming program that could increase the deficit by $50 billion or more. 
 "United States fiscal policy has been immobilized by the failure to deal with the budget deficit," said Stanley Fischer, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Professor Fischer was in Wyoming this weekend, along with dozens of other leading economists, for a conference organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
Bush Administration officials and many conservative economists contend that if Washington embraced a large-scale fiscal stimulus program, it would probably push up long-term interest rates because the bond markets are already so worried about the deficit. By hampering home buying and business investment, higher rates would sabotage the stimulative effects of increased deficit spending, they say.
If Administration officials are envious of what Japan is doing, the Tokyo plan does offer some solace: the Japanese package could spur America's exports to Japan by billions of dollars a year.
As Japan's economy grows faster, that will increase its demand for foreign goods; the United States supplies about one-third of Japan's imports. Not only that, faster growth could strengthen the yen, which could also help American exports. This could also help reduce Japan's rapidly growing trade surplus, the source of tensions with Washington.
 
Help for the World
 Indeed, with growth languishing in the United States and Europe, the Japanese package could prove a much-needed locomotive for world growth.
"The Japanese program is likely to help reverse the Japanese recession and it will have important repercussions for the world," said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard University economist.
Japanese officials predict their $86 billion economic package will increase economic growth by more than 2 percentage points over the next 12 months, from the modest 2 percent that was anticipated to a robust 4.4 percent. Those numbers must make the Bush Administration jealous because, with Election Day rapidly approaching, it is dogged by high unemployment and stunted growth of less than 2 percent.
The program that the Japanese Government announced on Friday calls for investing $69 billion to build roads, sewers, schools and other public-works projects. It includes spending the other $17 billion on housing assistance and on buying land for future public projects.
Yoshio Suzuki, vice chairman of the Nomura Research Institute, said Japan's stimulus package would make its economy "go back to its former growth track of over 4 percent a year" and would make Japanese manufacturers "as competitive as ever." The package offers tax incentives to encourage companies to invest in automation and energy-saving equipment.
 
Aiding Stocks and Banks
 The program also aims to help Tokyo's shell-shocked stock market by, for example, allowing public pension funds to buy more stock. Another objective is to shore up the troubled banking sector by helping banks dispose of bad loans by propping up real estate prices.
Japan is able to embrace fiscal stimulus, a classic countercyclical tool, because it has a sizable budget surplus, when receipts for its Social Security Trust Fund are included.
"The fundamental point is Japan has a fiscal surplus of 3 percent of gross domestic product," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "Japan is in fact the only major industrial country in a position to launch a major expansionary program."
 
Money for States and Cities
 In contrast, America's budget deficit represents more than 5 percent of gross domestic product. Even so, early this year Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and James Tobin, a Nobel Prize winner at Yale, headed a group of 100 economists who urged Washington to spend $50 billion more a year on public works to push America's stalled economy forward. They asserted that month after month of slow growth was worse for the nation than a $50 billion increase in the deficit.
Professors Solow and Tobin said the $50 billion should go to states and cities, many of which are in such bad financial straits that they have raised taxes, laid off workers and aborted public-works projects -- moves that further depress the slumping economy. They argue that states and cities would restart public-works projects and rehire workers using the Federal money, giving a quick lift to the economy.
"The continuing weakness of the United States economy makes fiscal expansion look more attractive if it can be done in a way that does not undermine confidence in a long-term solution to the deficit problem," said Professor Summers of Harvard.
To spur growth without pushing up the deficit long term, he proposes that some Federal grant money that is due states in future years be given this year.
 
Administration Arguments
 Administration officials say such proposals may hardly increase growth, asserting that they would push up long-term rates and might not produce additional spending because states might merely cut taxes once they receive the Federal money.
With its emphasis on improving infrastructure, the Japanese package sounds somewhat like Gov. Bill Clinton's proposals to spend $80 billion over four years on building railways, highways and a new telecommunications system. His call for spending money on America's rundown infrastructure has a different emphasis from the Japanese program: the aim of the Clinton program is not to pull the nation out of recession, but to make the economy more efficient.
"Japan is perceived as having a crying need for infrastructural investment," said David D. Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services. "It's not that its infrastructure is run down; it's that it's incomplete."

Hurricane Likely to Reshape The TV Market in Miami

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Routine television audience measurement was disrupted last week by the absence of the nation's 16th-largest television market from the national Nielsen ratings.
The devastation in Miami caused by Hurricane Andrew created havoc for the city's television stations, two of which are owned by networks. Worst hit was WCIX, the station owned by CBS. The station's broadcast tower was blown over by the hurricane winds, knocking the station off the air for 12 hours. The station managed to resume its signal by relying on a low-power station that CBS owns north of the city, but still managed to reach only about 40 percent of the normal Miami viewing area. 
 That could have led to a severe competitive disadvantage, except for the fact that the lack of electricity in other parts of the city prevented other stations from being seen widely.
But both the NBC-owned station, WTVJ, and the ABC affiliate, WPLG, were able to marshal their resources and put together 24-hour coverage of the storm and its aftermath, while WCIX had far fewer resources to call upon because of damage to its news-gathering equipment.
WTVJ is expected to reap particular benefits from its storm-related coverage once the city returns to normal. The station's weather reporter, Bryan Norcross, was widely credited in Miami last week for providing the best and most comprehensive information throughout the storm. Mr. Norcross was on the air for 22 straight hours, giving out information and even direct advice to many threatened by the storm. It is expected that his performance may ultimately increase his station's news ratings significantly.
 
Chaos for the Ratings
 Johnathan Rodgers, the president of CBS's stations division, said ratings measurement in the market had been thrown into chaos, with no way for any advertiser to know what was being seen. "No one knows who's watching what," he said.
Jack Loftus, a spokesman for the A. C. Nielsen Company, said: "In the days after the storm, the Miami ratings were nowhere. We lost too many homes to do any sort of count."
He said the homes counted in the national people-meter survey, which determines national ratings, were wiped out for one day and reached no more than 20 percent of their normal reporting level any day last week.
"There is no telling when that market will be back to full service," Mr. Loftus said. "We may have to resurvey the whole area. I have a feeling it will be later rather than sooner."
Mr. Rodgers added: "We're used to saying the ratings measure homes with television. Now we're talking about homes with electricity."
It will be weeks before the economic impact on the television market can be assessed. "We haven't even begun to think of the economic consequences of this," said Allen Shaklin, the general manager of WCIX.
The personal consequences have been especially serious for WCIX, with more than half the station's employees -- including Mr. Shaklin -- left homeless by the storm. Many of them moved into the station temporarily. CBS in New York had food and building supplies shipped to Miami in an effort to help them.
Mr. Rodgers said the station would build a new broadcast tower. "That's covered by insurance," he said. "We also have insurance for loss of business. But to what extent that will cover the actual losses, we have no idea right now."

HEADLINE: Firms Wary About Hiring

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Recent hiring trends suggest that the economic recovery will remain sluggish in the fourth quarter, the temporary help contractor Manpower Inc. said today.
Of 15,000 companies surveyed, 21 percent plan hiring increases in the quarter, while 11 percent plan to cut their work forces, Manpower said. 
 The percentages are virtually unchanged from a year earlier, when 21 percent planned to hire more workers and 12 percent planned cuts.
"We see no signs of a significant downturn, but at the same time there is little evidence that robust hiring activity will take place," said Mitchell Fromstein, president of the company, based in Milwaukee.
He said the softness of the economic upturn and concerns over possible changes in the Government after the November election are keeping employers cautious.
"There seems to be a wait-and-see attitude that is likely to prevail for several months," Mr. Fromstein said.
Manpower assesses hiring trends every quarter through its telephone survey of public and private employers in 465 American cities. The survey found that hiring plans were at much the same levels as earlier in the year, except for expected hiring increases in the wholesale and retail sector before Christmas and a downturn in hiring for construction jobs.
The South and Midwest showed the strongest hiring outlooks, and the Northeast and West the weakest.

That Face, Those Fees, for Many Ads

BYLINE: By JAY E. ROSEN

 BODY:
More and more, advertisers are using a select group of high-profile models to promote their products.
Whereas in the past, many of these so-called super models seemed to be the exclusive property of top fashion houses, today they can be seen hawking everything from one-of-a-kind outfits to Gap jeans and diet soda. 
 Of course, models like Fiona Campbell-Walter, Jean Shrimpton, Verushka, Twiggy and Lauren Hutton have been used in the past to capture consumers' attention. But now, with recession-weary marketers trying to save money by cutting back on the number of advertisements they run, many are taking other steps to insure that their products are noticed.
 
Seeing the Same Faces
 And this can result in a seeming paradox: in tough times, these marketers are willing to spend extra money to use well-known models, rather than less-expensive models who are also far less known.
As such, consumers are increasingly seeing the same faces promoting a wide range of products.
For instance, Christy Turlington can be seen in ads for Anne Klein, Maybelline and Calvin Klein fragrance; Irene Pfeifer in ads for the Gap, Tse Cashmere, Emmanuel sportswear and Incognito perfume, and Cindy Crawford in ads for Pepsi-Cola, Revlon and Capezio bags.
"The impression many people are getting is that there are only five models out there," said John C. Jay, executive vice president of marketing and creative services at Bloomingdale's.
Mr. Jay is critical of the overuse of such models by advertisers who believe they are playing it safe. "To say 'Who's hot? Let's get them,' is not creative," he said. "It's brainless."
 
Providing the Right Image
 Still, some advertising executives said such models were often needed to provide the right image for their products.
Ted Sann, vice chairman and executive creative director of the ad agency BBDO New York, said he decided to use Ms. Crawford for the Pepsi campaign because her personality caught his attention.
"We originally tried other, less-known models, but the magic was missing," he said.
Mr. Sann said research by Pepsi and BBDO showed that the Crawford ad had proved successful in consumer likability, awareness and retention. He said a USA Today poll ranked a Pepsi ad featuring Ms. Crawford and two young boys spying on her as the second favorite commercial during the Super Bowl. Nike's ad, with Bugs Bunny, rated No. 1.
Joe Hunter, executive vice president and part owner of Ford Models Inc. in New York, said the modeling industry had been able to maintain some stability during the recession because of the increased demand for such models and the higher fees that some can command.
 
What Models Can Earn
 The average fee for most models, many of whom do catalogue work, is $1,250 to $3,500 a day, several people in the industry said. But well-known models may receive $3,500 to $6,000 a day. And the superstar models usually negotiate even higher fees.
Ford, like most modeling agencies, receives a 20 percent service fee from the client and a 20 percent commission from the model.
Mr. Jay contends that as the economy improves, there will be more opportunities for models in big-name campaigns. "Different clients will have different needs," he said.
For example, Deryl George is a frequently requested model who currently appears in Versace fragrance ads, as well the fashion pages of GQ magazine. But the 33-year-old model believes the days of seeing the same five or six faces everywhere may soon be coming to an end.
"During the high point of the recession, there was a group of about 10 of us whom I seemed to be bumping into at every assignment," he said. "But lately I'm seeing less and less of them and seeing new faces every day."
 
A Face in the Catalogues
 One such model is Donnie Eichar. With the exception of some editorial work in YM magazine and the European fashion publication Donna, Mr. Eichar, 20, who started modeling a year and a half ago, does mostly catalogue work.
So far, Mr. Eichar does not seem too concerned about not getting that many big assignments from advertisers or magazines. "Those assignments are only a small percentage of the work out there for models, and most models are doing what I am doing," he said.
On the other hand, Gillian Mather, a 27-year-old model from Australia who has appeared in print campaigns for Diet Coke and Bailey's Irish Cream, doubts that most models will benefit greatly even when advertising budgets increase again.
"When you have women ages 12 to 35 from all over the country able to recognize the models in the ads, that's an indication that people love this approach," she said of using the well-known faces.
The modeling industry is also feeling pressure from the increasing use of illustrations, fewer models in advertisements and in some cases the use of no models, or "no-frills advertising," like full-page ads with straight copy or a picture of a pair of headphones sitting atop a stereo instead of somebody's head.
 
Not 'a Knee-Jerk Reaction'
 Mr. Jay insisted that larger advertisers usually did not choose to forgo models to save money. Instead, he said, they sometimes found ads without models more effective. "We don't want to act in a knee-jerk reaction and insist that every ad has to have a model in it," Mr. Jay said.
And Pauline Bernatchez, owner and president of Pauline's Model Management, a midsize New York agency, did acknowledge that ads without models were sometimes a practical way to attract customers. "The words sale and reduced can sometimes be more seductive than a beautiful woman," she said.
Mr. Hunter said almost all areas of modeling were feeling the recession's pinch. He noted that two of his most successful models, who only do hand modeling, were finding less work. "Not only did advertisers stop using complete people, they stopped using body parts as well," he said.

(Stacey P. Morgan for The New York Times); Cindy Crawford, a superstar model who does ads for Revlon as well as Pepsi-Cola and Capezio bags.

HEADLINE: Fischer and Spassky Ready to Play Chess Not Far From a War

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: SVETI STEVAN, Yugoslavia, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Even by his own eccentric standards, the reclusive American chess genius Bobby Fischer has come up with something seriously weird in agreeing to make a comeback against his old rival Boris Spassky at this coastal resort just 70 miles from the carnage of the Balkan war.
Defying United States Government threats of stiff fines or even long imprisonment for breaking the current United Nations sanctions on Yugoslavia, Mr. Fischer has holed up in a medieval fort-turned-hotel overlooking the clear waters of the Adriatic. His heavily guarded suite, No. 118, is known as Villa Sophia because Sophia Loren once stayed here. 
 If Mr. Fischer, famous for flirting with commitments and then backing off, does indeed start the first game as scheduled on Wednesday, it will be the first time he has played in public since he won the world championship from Mr. Spassky 20 years ago in a match that narrowed the cold war to a chessboard and held the world riveted.
Surrounded by olive trees, pines, oleander and palm trees, Mr. Fischer, who is 49 years old, is shielded from even the faintest echo of the nearby fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the encircling mountains. Since arriving a month ago, he has spent most of his time in his rooms preparing for the match, though he did, the hotel staff said, allow himself a respite with his chess-playing, 18-year-old Hungarian girlfriend, Zita Rajcszanyi.
Washington is trying to stop him from playing. American officials in Belgrade said they had written repeatedly to Mr. Fischer's hotel warning him that he could be fined as much as $250,000 or go to prison for up to 10 years if he plays. The match, with total prize money of $5 million, is considered a business transaction by the United States Treasury and so a breach of the sanctions.
The American officials said they had received no response. Mr. Fischer, the Yugoslav organizers of the match say, is not unduly concerned by the views of Washington. "Mr. Fischer can stay here for the next 10 years," said Klara Mandic, a close friend of the Belgrade-based businessman who arranged the encounter. Mr. Spassky, who has French citizenship and whose family lives outside Paris, has apparently not been pressed on the issue by the French Government.
Posters, banners and T-shirts throughout this resort, which was much favored by the former Yugoslav Communist leader Marshal Tito, proclaim the match "the world chess championship revenge match of the 20th century." It is, in fact, merely an exhibition match, albeit an extraordinary one.
 
Refused to Defend Title
 Mr. Fischer forfeited the world title in 1975, three years after his victory over Mr. Spassky in Reykjavik, Iceland, by refusing to defend it against Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union. He was the first world champion to give up the title without losing. The current champion, Gary Kasparov, has dismissed the new Fischer-Spassky encounter as a crassly commercial matching of two has-beens.
Others are not so sure. Mr. Fischer, despite his long absence, still has the world's second-highest rating behind Mr. Kasparov. Many chess masters are tantalized by the prospect that, even two decades after his last public games, Mr. Fischer could reproduce something close to the relentless strategic brilliance and devastating precision with which he crushed Mr. Spassky in Reykjavik and insured his status as one of the greatest players ever.
"It's enormously intriguing," said Lothar Schmid, the German grandmaster who refereed the stormy match in Iceland and who will again be the referee here.
Whatever its quality, the match clearly has its shabby side. It is being played for a large sum of money on the fringes of a continuing war in which at least 9,000 people have died in recent months. Neither player has as yet commented on that fact.
The encounter has been organized by a mysterious Serbian trader turned private banker named Jezdimir Vasiljevic, who is apparently as rich as he is ferociously nationalistic. Yugoslav magazines and newspapers have linked him to currency speculation and trafficking of various kinds, including arms dealing, but have produced no proof of their claims. Mr. Vasiljevic, whose recently established Jugoskandic Bank is financing the match, has said he hopes to profit through spinoffs like books and other ventures. He did not respond to a request for an interview.
 
'Anything Could Happen'
 The match contract calls for the winner to get $3.35 million and the loser $1.65 million. The two former world champions are to play until one of them wins 10 games, with draws not counting. If each player wins nine games, the match, to be played in a specially prepared basement room in the waterfront Maestral Hotel about a mile from Mr. Fischer's villa, will be declared a draw and the prize money shared equally.
These are rules Mr. Fischer has long favored despite many players' objections. When a version calling for only six victories was used in the 1984-85 Kasparov-Karpov title match, play was finally stopped after more than five months: both contenders were exhausted and neither had enough victories to win. Usually, match rules provide that draws will count a half-point and that the number of games will be limited to 24.
"Anything could happen," said Dimitrije Bjelica, an international chess master and former friend of Mr. Fischer's. "After so many years, it is very hard to say what the quality of the games will be. It's like trying to do a remake of a great movie classic 20 years after it first appeared. You just don't know how it will come out."
Certainly, much has changed on both the personal and geopolitical level since the Reykjavik encounter, which Mr. Fischer, playing with a devouring accuracy that sometimes verged on the cruel, won by 12 1/2 to 8 1/2 after losing the first two games. His prize money then amounted to $156,430.
In 1972, with both the cold war and the Soviet Union still in existence, bitter, sometimes apparently absurd charges of spying, and even of the use of chemical and electronic warfare, characterized the match. A recurrence of this seems unlikely under the new world order.
At the time, Mr. Spassky was an enormously respected world champion. Since then, living the good life in France, he is said by friends to have let himself go somewhat. He is now, at age 55, tied for 96th to 102d place on the ratings list of the Paris-based International Chess Federation.
Mr. Fischer is also a changed man in some respects. The lean, gaunt figure with hooded eyes, who brooded over the chess board like a predatory bird, has given way to an overweight, balding, bearded figure, unmistakably middle-aged, whose expression sometimes seems strikingly vacant.
Has his genius disappeared with his looks? Reports over the past 20 years have portrayed him as living an unusual life in Los Angeles, at times in his own apartment and at others in cheap hotels where he would check in under pseudonyms.
He has, former friends say, been given to anti-Semitic outbursts even though his mother is Jewish. At one time he became deeply involved in a fundamentalist sect called the Worldwide Church of God, which believed that Christ would return to earth in 1975 after a nuclear holocaust.
It was through this sect that he met a woman named Claudia Mokarow, whom he is said to have addressed as "Mommy." Mr. Fischer has never given interviews and has declined to do so here.
 
Still Formidable?
 To what extent he has kept up his chess during his long period of seclusion has remained a mystery. But it is generally believed that he has assiduously continued to study and follow the game, which became his monomaniacal passion as a child.
Mr. Fischer became a grandmaster at the age of 15 and won the United States championship for the first time when he was 16. His subsequent career was brilliant, but marked by outbursts over playing conditions -- often supported by less-outspoken colleagues -- that made his presence in any tournament unpredictable.
His stormy character has apparently not changed. Organizers said that the table on which the games against Mr. Spassky are to be played had already been altered seven times to Mr. Fischer's requests, and that they were still not clear that he was satisfied. The lighting, also built to suit Mr. Fischer, remains under discussion as well.
But up to now, the American chess giant has shown no sign of pulling out. Surrounded by four burly bodyguards -- one in front, one on either side, and one behind -- he has become a familiar sight on the steep stone alleys of the tiny peninsula on which his hotel is set.
Simonida Djordjevic, an artist with a gallery on the peninsula, said that Mr. Fischer strode in a few days ago and roared "Stop!" to his bodyguards. Then, taking what she described as huge strides, he raced around the works before freezing in front of a painting of a naked woman. Then he dropped to his knees and caressed the canvas, saying how beautiful it was.
On the way out, he asked how much a poster cost. Miss Djordjevic told him it cost nothing, which she said left Mr. Fischer incredulous. He took several. "He is a strange man indeed," Miss Djordjevic said.
Just what has lured Mr. Fischer here and tempted him to come out of seclusion is unclear. Over the past two decades, he has received many lucrative offers but spurned them.
He is known to like Yugoslavia, now reduced to a rump state comprising Serbia and Montenegro about half the size of the country he first visited 30 years ago, and is a friend of the grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric and other Yugoslav players. But his affection for the country appears an insufficient explanation for so unlikely a voyage.
One theory is that Mr. Fischer, a man with a huge ego, has been piqued into returning by two recent humiliations. One was Mr. Kasparov's recent achievement in passing him on the ratings list to become the highest-ranked player in the world. The second was the achievement of the young Hungarian woman, Judit Polgar, in becoming a grandmaster at an earlier age than Mr. Fischer did.
Another theory is simpler. It is that Mr. Fischer might be interested in marrying his new girlfriend and that she has been asking him just what they are going to live on.

HEADLINE: Review/City Opera;
A 'Barbiere' Worthy of Trust With Both Head and Heart

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
If the New York City Opera continues to revise and rethink its coverage of the standard repertory, it could do worse than to use its current production of "Il Barbiere di Siviglia" as a model. Rossini's opera returned to the New York State Theater on Friday evening.
Desmond Heeley's set is unusually well suited to the proportions of the company's stage. Its rotating components, turning exteriors to interiors and back, have an elegant simplicity. They are clever but not fussily so. Mr. Heeley's costumes, especially for Rosina, offer what seems to be a calculated tastelessness, one that lends an interpretive weight all its own to Rossini's characters. 
 Christian Smith is the stage director responsible for this year's reinterpretation of the Lotfi Mansouri production. At the opening sequences, one cringed a little for the evening to come. Fiorello (Jeff Mattsey) swamped the serenade scene with hyperactive gesture; Jan Opalach's Bartolo appeared a caricature of a caricature, an inflation of a thousand other Bartolos from a thousand past performances.
Yet gradually, the troubling elements assimilated into a coherence. The double takes assumed a certain subtlety. Choreographed gesture and freeze-frame tableaux introduced the comic element of man-as-machine. By the final ensemble of Act I, the listener was very much with this "Barbiere" and by the end, its firm friend.
Robert Orth's Figaro rescued one's confidence in the performance with his famous opening announcement, "Largo al factotum." Mr. Orth uses the toothy leer to good effect; his baritone is high enough for the part, broad when it needs to be and with an agility that is up to Rossini's athletic requirements.
Both romantic leads are less striking but they served their purposes. As Almaviva, Paul Austin Kelly offered a thin, metallic tenor. It can scrape uncomfortably against the high end of the role's tessitura, but the flexibility is there when it is needed. Mr. Kelly survived in decent health.
Kathryn Gamberoni as Rosina sang with a soprano that can penetrate this big house at climaxes but seems to lack the underlying resonance that creates command and presence at quieter levels. She is a singer in firm control, however; every vocal gesture is intelligently thought out; fioritura is expertly handled. I don't know whose idea her judicious tempos in "Una voce poco fa" originally were, but they made eminently good musical sense.
Mr. Opalach sang with the appropriate weight, and one got more or less used to his histrionics. Harry Dworchak was a splendid Basilio, rich in voice and with a sure sense of understated comedy. Susanne Marsee sang Berta's aria "Il vecchiotto cerca moglie" with bluff emphasis. John Lankston was Ambrogio; William Ledbetter played the Official.
The City Opera orchestra conducted by Scott Bergeson played with a sincerity that translated into rough enthusiasm. The chorus sang together; indeed, communication between stage and pit was generally good. Ken Tabachnick's streaks of light and shadow gave the storm sequence a nice vividness.

Stalking a Japanese Money Mafia

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

Silent Thunder
By Peter Tasker
287 pages. Kodansha International. $20.
Here's a fairly new category: the international financial thriller from Japan. The theme has been brushed against before, most recently in Michael Crichton's "Rising Sun," but that was told from an American viewpoint and wasn't a traditional suspense novel. Of course, any number of nonfiction books have described the powerful role of the Japanese economy in world commerce. What makes Peter Tasker's "Silent Thunder" welcome as pure entertainment is that it pulls out all the fictional stops yet does so convincingly. 
 It comes as a surprise to learn that Mr. Tasker isn't a native of Japan but a British financial strategist who divides his time between Hong Kong and Tokyo. He and his characters seem totally familiar with the culture of Japan, including its polite business surface and its darker subterranean life. Even for an author who is an Oxford graduate, it is daring to create a Japanese private investigator in a first novel and, what's more, have him serve as your narrator and protagonist.
The private investigator, Mori, is a former angry young man who was expelled from his university 20 years ago for sloganeering and torching files kept on students. That ended his chance to be an executive at a major corporation; because his scholastic record followed him, he couldn't get past the outer office for an interview. Mori is marked down forever as a troublemaker, a man with no respect for consensus and group harmony: the opposite of a good Japanese company man. Being an outsider, he doesn't have to play by the rules: the perfect background for a P.I.
Most of Mori's work is routine: finding runaway teen-agers, pre-marriage investigations, stalking unfaithful spouses, gathering evidence in divorce cases. He operates out of a windowless office in a ramshackle building that was built to withstand earthquakes (shades of Sam Spade in San Francisco). The only busy enterprise in the building is a pornographic video store on the ground floor where, for an added fee, extra services are performed.
The case Mori handles for a bereaved mother and father, living in an unspoiled part of the country, is different. Their married son, who had been at the top of his class at Tokyo University and gone on to an important job in the Ministry of Finance, had jumped, fallen or been pushed from a window on the 20th floor of an expensive Tokyo hotel. His parents cannot imagine that their brilliant son committed suicide, as the official police report says, so they hire Mori to discover the truth behind his death.
When Mori tracks down a former classmate of the dead man, he detects that they are being followed. The classmate recalls a conversation in which his friend told him about dangerous information he had uncovered concerning a coming crisis in the international financial markets. Mori learns that a secret network exists in the highest circles of Japan -- not just in the Ministry of Finance but in other ministries, the major financial institutions and the media -- to manipulate the markets. Not long after he leaves Mori, the classmate is killed.
The secret network turns out to be Silent Thunder, a syndicate interested in more than the fantastic sums of money it already commands. Silent Thunder has operatives all over the world. Its leaders want to use the financial markets to turn Japan away from the decadent West and revive an old dream of controlling all of Asia.
Down a narrow lane about a mile from the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, Silent Thunder's power brokers gather in the back room of a restaurant to scheme, drink and indulge their other appetites. A young actress is stretched out on a tatami mat before them, playing an undemanding role, "requiring her just to lie still while the men picked slices of sashimi and other delicacies off her naked body." In this and in more exotic scenes, the world of kinky sex and the world of high finance are linked by the would-be masters of the universe.
Who are the fictional members of Silent Thunder and are they as close to reality as the German neo-Nazi characters encountered by George Smiley in John le Carre's novels? The author writes: "After the war, much the same group gathered to plan how to outmaneuver the Occupation authorities and their dangerous liberal reforms. In this room in 1955, the 'black curtain men' -- so called for their similarity to the faceless puppeteers of Bunraku theater -- negotiated the merger of the Liberal and Democratic Parties, thus starting off a political ascendancy that had yet to be broken."
In hyperactive plotting, Mr. Tasker introduces a second set of characters in Washington. There, led by a successful poll taker, a group of Government operatives decide that a certain rising young Senator with boyishly handsome features and carefully tousled blond hair will be the next President of the United States. It's not hard to guess whom the author is trying to portray.
When Mori's shrewd investigation collides with the ruthless members of the secret society, "Silent Thunder" soars. In the course of the novel, the reader learns a bit more than may be necessary about cash-laundering systems in the Eurobond market and other financial manipulations across the International Dateline. Yet "Silent Thunder" hangs together as a financial thriller. At the end, Mr. Tasker allows himself the last word: "As the Russians used to say of their history books, 'It's all true, except for the facts.' "

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Ad Campaign;
Clinton: Focusing on the Economy

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

 BODY:
TELEVISION SCRIPT -- Announcer: "Something's happening. People are ready. Because they've had enough -- enough of seeing their incomes fall behind and their jobs on the line. Enough of a Government that just doesn't work. They're ready for change. And changing people's lives, that's the work of his life. Twelve years battling the odds in one of our nation's poorest states. Arkansas now leads the nation in job growth. Incomes are rising at twice the national rate.
"Seventeen thousand people moved from welfare to work. That's progress, and that's what we need now. Change. Real solutions. Bill Clinton has an economic plan to rebuild America that invests in our own people. Education. Training. Eight million jobs in the next four years.
"A new direction. Those making over 200,000 a year have to pay more. The rest of us get a break. But don't take their word. Read it yourself. It's a plan to put people first again. And six Nobel Prize economists say it'll work. For people. For a change. Bill Clinton for President."
ON THE SCREEN -- Colorful images from the campaign's bus tours, many in slow motion. The images are patriotic: small children, people along roadsides with American flags, Mr. Clinton reaching into crowds to shake hands. Mr. Clinton is also seen working at his Governor's desk and delivering his speech at the Democratic National Convention. (Sixty seconds).
ACCURACY -- The Clinton campaign issued a flurry of documentation for the claims in this ad, including statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Commerce and the Arkansas Department of Human Services to support figures on job and income growth and the contention that eight million jobs will be created in four years.
The claim that Mr. Clinton's tax increases will affect only those earning $200,000 or more is undercut by the campaign's own previous assertions that some people making more than $150,000 will see their taxes rise.
Officials of the Bush campaign said the ad emphasizes only the good news about Arkansas's record and Mr. Clinton's economic plan. Other rankings have shown that Arkansas comes in near the bottom in income per person and in environmental protection. In addition, Bush officials argue that Mr. Clinton's economic plan would cause job loss through military cuts.
SCORECARD -- The commercial will run in several states this week, but the Clinton organization will not say which ones. Like the 15-second commercials that were broadcast during the Republican convention, this ad seems intended to challenge the Republicans to respond. By continuing to focus on the economy, the Democrats are sticking to their determination to focus the debate on what they believe is the President's weak spot.

At 40, Connors Won't Grow Up or Give Up

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
Last year, just after turning 39, that awkward age when most tennis superstars have long since been shunted off to the country club to give lessons to suburbia's weekend warriors, Jimmy Connors went on a warpath of his own beneath the singular spotlight of the United States Open.
He didn't simply compete at the U.S.T.A. National Tennis Center in Queens; he commandeered the joint. 
 By gate-crashing the semifinals of the Open, a feat not managed by any other man of his advanced years at any Grand Slam tournament since Ken Rosewell did it here in 1974, Connors provoked near-hysteria in the sports world and beyond. And Connors did it his way, kicking and screaming and mugging for his equally impassioned audience in a series of improbable comebacks that not only reaffirmed his position as the grand old man of tennis, but also transformed him into an icon for the pre-geriatric generation.
He raised both fists, hazed five stunned opponents and set the sultry air above the National Tennis Center ablaze with electricity before Jim Courier, now ranked No. 1 in the world, siphoned the sizzle from the Connors bandwagon. Without the Connors entertainment quotient, the final weekend of the 1991 Open unfolded with an eerie sense of anticlimax: if Jimbo couldn't win it, it didn't really seem to matter who did.
"It was Jimmy's show," acknowledged Stefan Edberg, who took home the title but left the limelight to the veteran.
Connors has won the Open five times, the last time in 1983, and holds a record 97 victories in the tournament, which begins again today. The grit, noise, hubbub and irreverence that characterize New York and its Grand Slam also characterize Connors.
But last year, his 21st year of competing in the Open, was the magical one. It seemed to cast a spell not only on Connors's tennis, which lept into an ultra-kinetic second childhood, but on hundreds of thousands of spectators for whom he became, from the midnight when he reversed a two-set deficit against Patrick McEnroe in the first round, a down-home folk hero with the otherworldly powers of Peter Pan.
This year, doctoring a sore thigh and unconvinced of his durability in the five-set grind demanded by the Grand Slam format, Connors is determined to lash out in the direction of the big reprise.
When the 33d-ranked Connors turns 40 on Wednesday, he wants to give himself and his fans the ultimate birthday gift: a first-round victory that night over Jaime Oncins in the 1992 Open, to ignite the whole crazy process all over again.
"When I think about it, I still can't put into words what that felt like, and nothing before and nothing after will ever equal last year, I don't think," Connors said one day last week as he sat in his Manhattan hotel suite, with feet propped up and the television wailing, and wondered if it might be humanly possible to plot a similarly fantastic journey in 1992.
"Whatever happens to me now is irrelevant, but, man, I hope whatever it was that happened last year comes back and happens again. Enough is never enough, I guess," said Connors, for whom this final Grand Slam of the year will likely be the last of his career.
Have his priorities changed any?
"You always hear what a traumatic birthday 40 is, but I don't have time to think about it. My goal now is to reach 80," said Connors.
And if tennis remains an elixir, he'll keep using it. "My new hero is George Burns -- he's 95 years old and he signs a 15-year contract," Connors said. "I think that's great. Some people say I'm living in the past, and probably I am a little bit."
 
'These Kids Today'
 Connors figures he has competed "in three or four eras, from Gonzalez to Borg to McEnroe and Lendl to these kids today."
And it's the lack of gumption in "these kids today" that has kept Connors's pug nose firmly attached to the competitive grindstone.
"They all play great tennis, they do the job, but I mean, at 39 I shouldn't be beating these guys," he said of the current crop of front-rank players, which includes the Americans Courier, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. "What disappoints me is that that's all there is to them, doing the job, and there's nothing else behind that."
"They say they're players, not salesmen," said Connors, who glibly sells everything from sneakers to painkillers to deodorant but counts tennis as his main product. "They don't realize those people in the stands are paying good money during a serious recession to be entertained, to be made to feel like they're part of something."
 
A Dream Comes True
 At the 1991 Open, Connors said, he always connected with the crowd the way he had dreamed of.
"That was something I tried to do for the whole 20 years of my career, to take my tennis, put it on the high burner, turn on the crowd and make the place sound like a football or basketball or baseball game was going on," he said.
Leaping and gyrating and groaning from the primal effort of fending off a series of attacks from players half his age, schmoozing airily between points with courtside patrons and his cronies in the broadcast booth, Connors turned the Open into his own forum.
It was part heart, part drama, part cabaret and was, according to John McEnroe, "the once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing that only happens with the great ones."
"For a 40-year-old guy to get out there and put fear in the heart of any guy who has to play him is kind of incredible," McEnroe continued. "It's kind of what makes him a Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of our sport."
Last year's odyssey was nothing short of a personal resurrection for Connors, who just 11 months earlier had undergone major wrist surgery in the hope of prolonging a career he was not yet prepared to relinquish to the aches and pains of middle age.
The October 1990 surgery, which had not come with any guarantee, did the trick. By early 1991 he was out of his cast and back on the beat. He had always geared his recuperation to the 1991 United States Open, but there he was in May at the French Open, the only Grand Slam tournament he has never won, duking it out with a thunderstruck Michael Chang, the 1989 champion in Paris.
Connors, paralyzed by cramps in his lower back, had to abandon the match after winning the first point of the final set, but his bravado there seemed to set the stage for what happened at the Open a year ago. Despite the sore back, he had served notice that Jimbo was back on the prowl, and last year he raised his ranking 888 spots as proof.
After first-round losses at the French Open and Wimbledon earlier this year, Connors had estimated his chances of playing the United States Open as no better than 50-50 because, he said, "I was experiencing the closest thing to burnout I've ever had."
"After last year's Open, I just never stopped running, and it took a mental toll," he explained. "But I'm ready to go. I figure this is the Open that will really put me in the position to understand if I can continue on and play five sets or not. I already know I'm ready to whip anybody in three -- no problems there."
Not many 40-year-old men still call themselves Jimmy, or allow their mothers to preside over the day-to-day management of their careers. Not many 40-year-old men can be so prone to using blue body language and red-letter vocal language and get away with having their behaviour labeled mischievous rather than malevolent. But Connors seems to make it all work for him.
"People are paying him more attention, and more money, now than they did when he was No. 1," said Gloria Connors, whose son finished the years 1974-78 at the peak of his profession. "I guess that's what age does for you. Jimmy doesn't move as well as he used to, but he can still chase those young fellows off the court."
Connors has indicated that he intends to sponsor his own seniors tour next year rather than continue to put up with the ATP Tour establishment, which, he said, "gives the players no power even though they say it's player-run."
"I'll play six or eight events on the regular tour, if they'll have me, and then we're going to get this other tour rolling," said Connors, who will model his vehicle after the Senior PGA Tour. He expects to be joined by Vitas Gerulaitis, Ilie Nastase, Bjorn Borg and John Lloyd.
"We'll be playing real tennis -- that's the only kind I play," he said.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Pitch Floats Like a Butterfly, Stings Like a Bee

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
It floats and flutters. It dips and darts. It makes catchers cringe, it makes hitters grumble and it makes even confident managers pace the dugout.
What is it? A balloon dropping off the upper deck in the bottom of the ninth inning? An annoying team mascot interrupting play while Jose Canseco is batting with the bases loaded? 
 Of course not. Any of those vexations would be bearable compared to this baseball oddity. The floating, fluttering, hitter-harassing, catcher-cursing pitch being described is the knuckleball.
"I never got real excited about catching it," said Mike Stanley of the Yankees. "And I never get too excited about hitting it."
You remember the knuckleball. Think back now. There was Emil (Dutch) Leonard, one of the first pitchers to knuckle under in the 1930's. There was Hoyt Wilhelm, who pitched until he was 49, pitched in more games than anyone else and probably threw more knuckleballs than anyone else. There was Wilbur Wood, who had four straight 20-victory seasons, and then there were Phil and Joe Niekro, the brothers who learned the pitch from their father in a Lansing, Ohio, backyard and perfected it into 538 triumphs. They could all throw knucklers that turned .330 hitters into frustrated sitters.
 
And Wakefield Makes Three
 Wait, you haven't seen any knuckleballs lately? Well, 44-year-old Charlie Hough is still throwing one for the Chicago White Sox. Tom Candiotti, 35, is tossing one at his fourth major league address, this time in Los Angeles. And the new knuckleball pitcher on a very small block is a 26-year-old rookie, Tim Wakefield, who has kept the Pirates gliding toward another pennant with his wacky pitch, leading him to a 4-1 record and 2.02 earned run average.
The emergence of Wakefield, his ease on the mound and the little strain the knuckleball causes on the arm has drawn new attention to the forgotten pitch and resurrected a question that has been asked for decades: How come there are not more knuckleballers?
"The knuckleball is the last thing teams look for," said Phil Niekro. "I don't know why, but there doesn't seem to be much interest in it."
Candiotti, who is 9-11 despite his nifty 3.10 e.r.a., offers a reason why. "With the scouting system the way it is nowadays, you have to throw the ball pretty much at 90 miles an hour to get signed," Candiotti said. "So you've got to change the scouting system and get them out there looking for more guys who can be knuckleball pitchers."
Just look at Wakefield's twisted path to the big leagues. He hit .189 at Class A Watertown in 1988, and a teammate told Manager Woody Huyke that the light-hitting first baseman could throw a knuckleball. Four years later, he is one of only three major leaguers throwing the pitch and also wondering about the fuss it has spawned.
"It's just one stupid pitch," Wakefield said. "People make such a big deal out of it."
Said Pittsburgh Manager Jim Leyland: "They have him in the Hall of Fame already, and that's ridiculous."
 
A Rare Matchup
 All three knuckleball pitchers wear No. 49 (Wilhelm's number) so that should make them easy to trace. Candiotti and Wakefield even pitched in the same game Wednesday, and it was a memorable day for knuckleballers as both were superb before the Pirates emerged with a 2-0 victory. Wakefield tossed a complete-game six-hitter and Candiotti surrendered nine hits in the first matchup between knuckleballers in the National League since Joe Niekro and the Astros beat Phil Niekro and the Braves, 5-3, on Sept. 13, 1982.
"When you have a good game, it looks like the easiest pitch to throw and it makes the other hitters look so bad," Candiotti said. "But when you have a bad game, you know why there are not more knuckleball pitchers."
Only three out of almost 300 pitchers in the majors earn their salary tossing the knuckler, a pitch batters know is coming and still have trouble hitting. But if it frustrates hitters, why does the list of knuckleballers remain tiny?
"It's hard to do," said Hough, whose 6-10 record is deceiving as his e.r.a. is 3.76. "It's probably even harder to get a chance to do it."
 
No Time to Experiment
 The White Sox and Yankees have tried developing knuckleballers in the minors without success, but few teams have followed that route because the pitch is extremely difficult to throw for strikes.
"You normally don't see more than three or four throwing it at one time in the big leagues," Niekro said. "Hopefully, there will always be someone around throwing it."
To which Hough added: "There is no time to experiment with it. Now, you got to be quick."
Hough had to be quick to carve out a career for himself, and he never would have made it to the major leagues without the knuckleball. Back in 1969, Hough injured his shoulder and started tinkering with the knuckler. After only 10 minutes of placing his middle and index fingers above a circular seam on the baseball, bending them slightly and keeping his wrist stiff as he threw the ball, Hough said he knew he could master the pitch.
Beaming over the discovery, he found Tommy Lasorda, his minor league manager at Spokane, Wash., and relayed the news.
"I can throw a knuckleball," Hough announced. "And from now on, that is what I'm going to do."
"Good," Lasorda said. "Because if you didn't do something, you were going to get released."
With his new pitch, Hough went from being almost unemployed to being on the Dodgers in 1970 with the bases loaded and Willie Stargell batting in the ninth inning of a one-run game. Hough threw a knuckler, and another and another. Finally, the count was 3-2 and he threw two knucklers that Stargell fouled. Then Hough slipped a fastball by him, ending the game and completing an auspicious debut.
"Last fastball I ever threw to him," said Hough, who has 201 victories in the midst of his 20th season.
Wakefield probably has trouble remembering the last fastball he threw. In one game this season, 102 of his 105 pitches were knucklers.
"Everybody talks about the way it moves," Wakefield said. "I hear that all the time. I guess it's a really nasty pitch."
Nasty is an apt description. Though Niekro and Hough claimed they did not know exactly why a knuckleball does what it does, they might have been playing possum. They knew they never altered their grip on the ball, but they changed the speed and release point of the pitch to create various knucklers and further confound hitters.
Professor Robert Adair of Yale University, a physicist who wrote, "The Physics of Baseball," explained why a knuckleball can dance like Michael Jackson.
"The knuckleball is thrown so that the stitches on one side catch the air," Adair said. "It is smooth on the other side and that gives an imbalance. The disruption of the air gives you less air resistance and the ball moves in that direction."
A translation?
"It's a tough pitch to hit," Adair concluded.

HEADLINE: Riverside South: Still Questions

 BODY:
Will the abandoned Penn Yards -- 74.6 prime acres on Manhattan's Hudson River waterfront -- ever be put to good use? The last 30 years are littered with false starts. Now, a coalition of civic groups has persuaded Donald Trump to scale back his first proposal, a dense design that included the tallest building in the world. Exit Television City. Enter Riverside South.
Mr. Trump's newest version, with 16 apartment buildings, a huge film studio and a riverfront park, is an improvement on its outsize predecessor. Even so, the City Planning Commission is obliged to ask Mr. Trump a lot of tough questions before approving Riverside South. Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger has already won some intelligent concessions; more may be required. 
 The highway. The project's centerpiece is a 21.5-acre park along the river, made possible by moving an elevated portion of the old Miller Highway inland and down to grade level. But that road, better known as the West Side Highway, is being rebuilt right now, with $62 million in Federal and state funds.
What will happen to the riverfront park, and the whole project, if the highway can't be shifted?
Sewage. Riverside South, which stretches from 59th Street to 72d, will further burden the troubled North River sewage treatment plant. At Ms. Messinger's insistence, Mr. Trump guarantees that the project will not add to volume. How? By building a new treatment plant on-site, or by cutting down on the flow of water by retrofitting toilets, faucets and showerheads elsewhere in Manhattan, partially at his expense. Both plans seem unrealistic.
Subways. The 72d Street subway station, already dangerously crowded, needs expansion. Under the Messinger agreement, Mr. Trump will contribute $5 million to a job that will cost between $30 million and $50 million.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority argues that Mr. Trump should pay the entire cost. The M.T.A. is ultimately responsible for its own facility. But Mr. Trump has an obligation. Is $5 million enough?
The Park. The proposal envisions a waterfront park so complicated and sophisticated that it will cost the developer $63 million to build, and perhaps 10 times the park average to maintain. Under the Messinger agreement, Mr. Trump will relieve the city of half the maintenance cost. But wouldn't a less-ambitious park leave Mr. Trump with more cash for, say, the subway station, and save the city money as well?
Density. Is 8.3 million square feet, including 5,700 apartments, too much? That's considerably less than Television City's 14 million square feet, but still very large. Could the project be scaled down and remain economically viable?
The Planning Commission will vote in October. Then, within 50 days, the City Council gets its turn. Time is on the city's side to refine an ambitious plan that still has room for improvement.

Vile Rumors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I heartily endorse "Strange New Pals in the K.G.B." (editorial, Aug. 13). Few Americans noticed the shattering effect K.G.B. half-truths and outright concoctions had on the fledgling democratic movement in Eastern Europe. Take, for example, Czechoslovakia's parliamentary crisis when doctored files of leading dissidents were released. Many honorable men and women were "exposed" as informers. Looks like the same wave of filth is beginning to wash American shores. 
 Russians may have a lot to learn about market economics, but we can still teach America about disinformation. Every village pupil knows the credibility of information lies in its source. In Russia, slander campaigns made a legend of Andrei Sakharov and elected Boris Yeltsin president.
Dissemination of vile rumors in the United States indicates a slide in journalistic standards toward the old Soviet press. Responsible journalists don't choose spouses by their approachability -- mistaking easy virtue for faithfulness. So why mistake Russian sources?
Maj. Gen. Oleg Kalugin of the K.G.B., to whom you refer, received a journalism degree from Columbia University. For decades the Soviet Union sent K.G.B. officers as exchange students. Such men have the training to sound credible in fluent English. But the best stories, like the best spouses, are sometimes hard to get.
