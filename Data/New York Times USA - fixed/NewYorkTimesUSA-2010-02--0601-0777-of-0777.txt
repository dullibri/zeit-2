HEADLINE: Release Delayed, 'Shutter Island' Soars

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The gamble worked: ''Shutter Island,'' yanked from the fall release schedule by a cost-cutting Paramount Pictures, arrived in theaters on Friday and was a strong No. 1 at the North American box office. 
 This R-rated thriller, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, sold an estimated $40.2 million in tickets, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. In limited release overseas ''Shutter Island,'' which cost $75 million to make (after deducting tax rebates from Massachusetts, where the film was shot), sold an additional $9.1 million, according to Paramount.
 The robust result for ''Shutter Island'' validates Paramount's decision in August to abandon the film's initial release date of Oct. 2, though a marketing campaign was already well under way. The delay irritated fans and knocked the film out of contention for the 2009 Academy Awards.
 ''We have rarely felt more pressure about an opening,'' said Rob Moore, Paramount's vice chairman. ''Everyone was standing over us to see if the decision was a good one. Luckily, the result was phenomenal.''
 Hollywood was as surprised by the delay -- especially since it seemed to push around a power player like Mr. Scorsese -- as it was by Paramount's frank explanation. The studio said it simply could not afford to release the movie in the fourth quarter because of an industry-wide slump in DVD sales, among other financial concerns.
 Neither Mr. Scorsese nor Mr. DiCaprio has had an opening this big, even when adjusted for inflation. The previous high-water mark for Mr. Scorsese was ''The Departed,'' which sold about $27 million over its first three days in 2006. Mr. DiCaprio's previous record was the 2002 comedic drama ''Catch Me if You Can,'' which had a $30 million opening.
 Exit polls for ''Shutter Island'' showed the audience was equal parts male and female and of a wide age range, a rarity for an R-rated picture and a good omen for sales in the weeks ahead. The movie, which received mixed reviews, is based on a Dennis Lehane novel and focuses on a mystery at a hospital for the criminally insane.
 The ensemble comedy ''Valentine's Day'' (Warner Brothers) was second for the weekend with about $17.2 million for a new total of $87.4 million. ''Avatar'' (20th Century Fox) continued to chug away in third place, selling about $16.1 million in tickets for a new total of $687.8 million.
 ''Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief'' (Fox) was fourth with about $15.3 million ($58.8 million total). The expensive thriller ''The Wolfman'' (Universal Pictures) fell sharply in its second week to fifth place with about $9.8 million ($50 million total.)

HEADLINE: City's Public Hospitals Fear Huge Loss in Subsidies

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
The city's public hospital system, the largest in the nation, is facing a fiscal crisis because New York State is threatening to cut its financing for the care of poor patients at a time when the number of uninsured patients has soared, city officials said Sunday.
 The cuts, included in Gov. David A. Paterson's executive budget proposal, could drain from the public hospitals up to $370 million, much of it in federal financing, and shift the money to programs in voluntary, or private, hospitals, the city officials said. 
 The officials said the cutbacks were the latest in a series of steps by the state to close a huge deficit by pulling back on longstanding budget commitments. 
 State budget officials said, however, that much of the proposed cutback was the result of federal stimulus money running out. They added that the governor's proposal also called for the State Legislature to enact cuts to private hospitals, and that some of that money would go back to the public hospitals. 
 Yet the dispute between the state and the city goes deeper, with both sides at odds on how much would be cut and how, and even on where some of the money comes from. 
 Alan D. Aviles, the president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the 11-hospital public system, said the proposed cuts would severely weaken the system, putting it on a downward spiral similar to that faced by the city's Roman Catholic hospital system. New York's last Catholic hospital, St. Vincent's in Manhattan, is now near bankruptcy and struggling to avoid shutting down.
 ''If you look at the Catholic system and St. Vincent's, the instability in that system didn't happen overnight,'' Mr. Aviles said Sunday in a telephone interview. ''Four or five years down the road here, we have to be looking at a replay of what happened to the Catholic medical system.'' 
 The current budget struggle not only pits the state against the city, it also pits the public hospital system, the main safety net for the poor, against the city's private, nonprofit hospitals, many of which are also struggling under the burden of a large number of poor patients.
 City officials said they had learned just last week that unless the Legislature stepped in, the governor's budget would slash $370 million from the public hospitals, including $70 million in Medicaid reimbursements and a nearly 50 percent cut, or $300 million, in a federal program called Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, which subsidizes institutions with large numbers of indigent patients.
 For many years, the hospital corporation received about $330 million annually in disproportionate share payments, Mr. Aviles said, but in each of the last two years the agency received an additional $300 million to help it care for the steep increase in uninsured patients. In the governor's proposal, he said, the public hospital system would lose all of that $300 million increase unless the Legislature approved $187 million in cuts to the same program for private hospitals. 
 If the Legislature reduces payments to the private hospitals, he said, under the executive budget city hospitals would receive whatever disproportionate share money was left in the state's allocation. He said state officials had told him that the balance would amount to $109 million. 
 At the same time, he said, the number of uninsured patients treated by city hospitals has increased 14 percent over the last four years, to nearly 453,000 from 396,000, with most of the increase coming as the city plunged into recession in 2007 and 2008. The public hospitals now provide almost half, or 48 percent, of all uncompensated clinic visits statewide, according to hospital corporation data.
 State officials acknowledged the basic situation described by Mr. Aviles but said the reduction would be far smaller than he predicted.
 They said a large part of the increase in disproportionate share money for the public hospitals had come from federal stimulus money, which had now run out. But they said that Mr. Paterson's budget anticipated that the Legislature would cut disproportionate share money to private hospitals, and that if it did, all $187 million in savings would be shifted to the Health and Hospitals Corporation. 
 ''We're very attentive to the impact on H.H.C.,'' John Ulberg, director of health care finance for the State Health Department, said Sunday.
 Mr. Ulberg and Wendy Saunders, the governor's deputy secretary for health, said that with their more optimistic projections, the cut to the public hospitals would total $31.5 million.
 But Mr. Aviles said that only a small amount of the shortfall, about $30 million, involved stimulus money, and that the proposed cuts, if fully enacted, would significantly add to the budget deficit of nearly $1 billion that the public hospital system was already facing. He said the system, which has a budget of $6.5 billion, would be forced to consider layoffs, on top of 1,000 jobs lost through attrition over the last year, and reductions in some of its specialty programs, like bariatric, or weight-loss, surgery. 
 He said he hoped that New York City would soften the blow by continuing to provide its matching portion of the contested disproportionate share payments, which comes to $150 million, but he added, ''Certainly that is not a foregone conclusion.''

HEADLINE: Oil Servicer To Buy Rival In $11 Billion Agreement

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Schlumberger, the giant oilfield-services company, announced on Sunday that it would acquire Smith International in an all-stock transaction valued at $45.84 a share. 
 The purchase price works out to more than $11 billion, based on the 247.4 million Smith shares outstanding in November. It would be the biggest acquisition in the United States so far this year. 
 The deal, if completed, would position Schlumberger well ahead of its next-largest rival, Halliburton. And it would keep Schlumberger growing apace with the oil sector itself, where producers have also been looking for acquisitions. 
 The giants of the oil industry want to combine with smaller companies that already own or control oil and gas fields to increase their reserves without finding new places to drill. Oilfield-services companies like Schlumberger are seeking to expand as well, so that they can offer bigger clients more products and services. 
 Schlumberger reported revenue of $22.7 billion in 2009, while Smith had $8.2 billion in revenue last year.
 Smith is the industry's biggest provider of drilling fluids, and the second-biggest provider of drill bits, according to a report issued last week by RBC Capital Markets. The report said that by acquiring Smith's drill-bit business, Schlumberger would secure a ''critical link'' in the chain of products and services that it sells to oil and gas producers. 
 A statement posted on Schlumberger's Web site said the offer was a 37.5 percent premium over Smith's closing stock price on Thursday. Smith's stock rose about 13 percent on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources, that a merger was close. Schlumberger's stock price fell about 3 percent on Friday. 
 Smith shareholders would receive 0.6966 of a Schlumberger share for each share they owned. The terms, which the statement said had been approved by both companies' boards, would leave Smith's current shareholders with 12.8 percent of Schlumberger's outstanding common stock. 
 The transaction must be approved by Smith's shareholders and by antitrust regulators. The companies' statement said that they expected the deal to close in the second half of this year. 
 Schlumberger said it would realize a pretax savings of about $160 million in 2011 and $320 million in 2012, after subtracting the costs of absorbing Smith's operations. The company is expected to shed some operations to satisfy antitrust regulators. 
 The two companies already had extensive industry ties. They own a 60-40 joint venture called M-I Swaco, which supplies drilling fluids to the oil and gas sector. Smith's chief executive, John Yearwood, is a former Schlumberger executive. 
 Schlumberger operates corporate headquarters in Paris, the Hague and Houston. Smith is based in Houston. 
 Schlumberger's chief executive, Andrew F. Gould, said in the statement that the company believed that more drilling, in increasingly difficult environments, was necessary to meet world energy demand. 
 The statement also said that adding Smith's drilling fluids and other products to Schlumberger's lines would help clients drill more economically under increasingly challenging conditions. The company did not respond to a call requesting further information. 
 In the statement, Mr. Yearwood said, ''Our customers will see accelerated technology development'' through the acquisition. 
 Schlumberger had a weak performance last year as the global recession cut demand for energy, which affected drilling. As the economy has shown signs of recovery, oil prices have risen. Schlumberger's latest earnings report, in January, predicted that its businesses would improve as energy demand grew.

HEADLINE: Limited Share-a-Cab Test to Begin Soon

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Share a cab, stranger? 
 Starting on Friday, the New York City taxi ride -- one of the city's few remaining redoubts of solitude -- will go communal. Up to four passengers will be able to share a yellow taxi ride, car-pool style, along three preset routes in Manhattan. 
 The flat fare will be $3 or $4 a head, significantly less than the regular metered rates, and riders can ask to be dropped off at most points along the route. The shared rides, which will pick up passengers at designated taxi stands, will be allowed only on weekdays from 6 to 10 a.m. 
 The share-a-cab program, a one-year experiment by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, amounts to a sea change in the strictly defined social world of the yellow cab. Private reflection may be forced to yield to the studied stoicism familiar to bus and subway riders accustomed to close quarters with strangers. 
 ''New Yorkers are grown-ups,'' said Matthew W. Daus, the taxi commissioner. ''I think they're going to work it out.'' 
 On one route, passengers will be picked up at a stand at West 57th Street and Eighth Avenue, near Columbus Circle, and driven to Grand Central Terminal via Park Avenue. Passengers can ask to be dropped off anywhere along Park from 57th to 42nd Street.
 The other routes also end at Grand Central, with one beginning at West 72nd Street and Columbus Avenue, and one at East 72nd Street and Third Avenue. 
 Park Avenue is also the designated drop-off corridor for those routes. 
 Passengers can pay with a credit card or cash, and the city suggests paying the fare upon entering the cab to avoid delays. 
 Shared rides were expected to start last fall, but the program has repeatedly been pushed back. The original plan called for additional group-ride stands at Grand Central, Pennsylvania Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. 
 Mr. Daus said these stands, along with two at La Guardia Airport, were forthcoming, but did not say when. 
 Group taxi rides, while commonplace in Washington, are a curiosity in New York, save for the transit strike of 2005 and a brief strike by cabdrivers in 2007, when the city unveiled a zoned fare system that let cabbies pick up multiple passengers. 
 The city was also inspired by a similar sharing arrangement that has long existed in Yorkville on the Upper East Side, where riders can pay $6 for a trip to Wall Street. There, passengers line up on a street corner for the next available cab, and drivers often wait for all four passengers to pile in before departing. 
 Cellphone chatter is verboten on these shared trips, and the traditional hierarchy of taxicab seating is turned on its head: riding shotgun, usually avoided by New Yorkers, is preferred when the alternative is a cramped back seat.
 Such social wrinkles -- do I avoid eye contact? -- may never have been anticipated by Emily Post. The city has no plans to address proper behavior in its signage or official rules, but Mr. Daus said that inspectors will oversee the stands in the early weeks of the experiment. 
 ''It would certainly have to have an etiquette,'' said Graham Hodges, a professor at Colgate University and the author of a social history of New York City cabdrivers. 
 Mr. Hodges, a former cabby himself, wondered if the taxis' close quarters could result in the harassment of some passengers. 
 ''Who would be the person who polices that?'' he asked. ''A driver would have to pay more attention to the back seat, rather than the laissez-faire attitude that's existed for about a century or so.''
 Officials say that both the cabbies and the passengers will benefit: on the Columbus Circle route, for instance, each rider will pay $3, about half of the normal cost. With a full car, the cabby can pocket twice the normal fare. The other routes charge $4 per person. 
 But a cabbies' group said the plan would cost drivers business.
 ''Every additional passenger that gets into one cab, that means a second cab is left empty,'' said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. ''It's horrible to implement a program like this in such hard economic times.''
 But would a driver earn more with four passengers instead of one? ''Only if you're the driver who gets those rides,'' Ms. Desai said. ''People are trying to earn a living, not hit the lottery.''

HEADLINE: A Model of Harmony Is Found in a Flashpoint City for Iraqi Sectarian Fighting

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS; Duraid Adnan and Mohammed Hussein contributed reporting from Baghdad, and an Iraqi employee of The New York Times from Samarra.

DATELINE: SAMARRA, Iraq 

 BODY:
Busloads of Iranian pilgrims arrive every day at this city's Askari Shrine, one of Shiite Islam's holiest places, which was badly damaged by a bombing four years ago that prompted reprisal killings and pushed the country to the brink of civil war.
 The city, where firefights between American soldiers and Sunni insurgents took place as recently as last year, is now generally peaceful -- and has been presented as a model of the harmony that can be achieved in other violent areas of the country. 
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who is running for re-election, has said that Iraq's security forces are able to keep the peace in Iraq without any American role. But in Samarra, local commanders do almost nothing without checking with the American military first, raising concerns about what will happen after the scheduled departure of United States combat troops at the end of August and the exit of all American forces from the country by the end of next year.
 Even in its peace, there are rumblings of discontent in Samarra. 
 The city's pacification has meant its division by a long stretch of gray blast wall separating the shrine and its pilgrims from the rest of the city; by rare -- and even then, often brittle -- social interactions between Sunnis and Shiites; and by the presence of dozens of police and army checkpoints. The economy is ruined, and the danger of fresh violence persists. 
 Still, Samarra has come so far from its days as a place of unrelenting violence that many in Iraq insist that it can ultimately be an example of nation building for the rest of the country. There is agreement among both the American military and the Iraqi government that Samarra must succeed if Iraq is to move forward without further fits of sectarian killing.
 ''National reconciliation started here when the people asked for international help in rebuilding the Askari Shrine,'' said Mahmood Khalef Ahmad, Samarra's Sunni mayor, who was wounded by gunmen from Al Qaeda a few years ago. ''What we have achieved here should be a clear example to other provinces in Iraq.''
 Much of that success, however, is due to the generally unseen hand of the United States, even as Americans minimize their current role in Samarra. Publicly, Mr. Ahmad is also dismissive of the continuing American influence in Samarra. But the mayor was appointed to his post by the American military, and as is the case of almost every other political, tribal or security official in town, he consults with the American military and civilians on an almost daily basis -- though almost always in private.
 The transition from America's exclusively military role in Iraq to one of moderator, persuader and occasional arm twister is not new, but it has taken on new urgency with the progression of the withdrawal and the difficulties in establishing democratic principles in a country unfamiliar with them. 
 ''We are coaching them, we are advising them, we are often a go-between,'' said David Stewart, team leader of the State Department's 55-member provincial reconstruction group for Salahuddin Province, where Samarra is located. ''Our goal is to be out of the picture.''
 The military has also adopted a behind-the-scenes strategy in Samarra. It has established a 24-hour joint operation center with the Iraqi police and the Iraqi Army where situational updates arrive in both Arabic and English. 
 The United States forces also have a team of enlisted men and officers working with Samarra Operations Command, which is responsible for the city's security and answers directly to Prime Minister Maliki.
 ''The interaction is constant,'' said Col. Hank Arnold, commander of the Fourth Infantry Brigade Combat Team, First Infantry Division from Fort Riley, Kan., the American military unit currently responsible for Samarra.
 Moreover, American forces meet nearly every day with the city's Awakening Councils -- well-armed groups of former Sunni insurgents who acknowledge having killed American troops in the past.
 And, according to Iraqi security officials in Samarra, American soldiers also continue to undertake raids -- with and without the participation or knowledge of their Iraqi counterparts, which would appear to violate the Status of Forces Agreement, which regulates the activities of American troops and their eventual withdrawal from Iraq. 
 ''They have many operations that we don't know about inside and outside the city,'' said Bassim Majid Jafar, deputy chief of the Samarra police. ''We don't know everything they do. But we trust them. The relationship is good.''
 Samarra resembles a dusty armed camp.
 It is policed by about 3,000 Iraqi security force members and an almost equal number of Awakening Council fighters. 
 Buildings, many made of mud, are crumbling. Bullet holes mark houses, walls and shop windows. The roads are riddled with potholes. While many Iraqi towns are packed with traffic jams because people have been able to afford relatively cheap imported automobiles, Samarra has little traffic and many people ride bicycles and mule carts. Open sewers flow through some neighborhoods. 
 The blast wall that protects the shrine but divides the town prevents pilgrims from shopping, eating in local restaurants or staying in hotels. Many businesses have been abandoned.
 ''The streets have been blocked, many buildings have been destroyed, and the people of Samarra have lived like strangers in their own city,'' said Mahdi Aran, a member of the local provincial council. ''If they want life to come back to the city, they have to take the wall down.''
 The Americans, who put the wall up, also say they would like it removed and replaced with an iron fence with gates and security cameras. But Colonel Arnold said he was awaiting the approval of the government in Baghdad, which is more skeptical about the safety of the shrine than the Americans.
 Repairs are under way at the 10th-century shrine but are still two years from being completed. It is topped by gray concrete instead of its famous golden dome, but it still attracts more than one million pilgrims each year, many from Iran. 
 While many Sunnis in Samarra view the Shiite shrine with reverence, many also regard it with anger. They say that it is a symbol of Iran's dominance of the city and that it attracts far more government attention and money than the city's predominately Sunni population does.
 Sheik Khalid Flaeh, an Awakening Council leader, said he was trying to halt what he believed was an attempt at a Shiite takeover in town.
 ''Iran has a big conspiracy in Samarra,'' he said. ''Iranians go to buy a house from the owner and offer to pay four times the amount. But we will not allow people to sell their houses to Iranians.'' He said he used fear to discourage home sales.
 ''We defeated Al Qaeda, and as long as we are here, there will be peace,'' he said about Sunni tribes in Samarra. ''But if there are no jobs, if they are not allowed to join the police and army, I might not be able to prevent them from joining Al Qaeda.''

HEADLINE: With the Senate Set to Vote on Jobs Bill, Governors Say They Still Need Assistance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the Senate poised to take a first test vote on a jobs bill, governors said Sunday that they still needed assistance from the federal government but urged Congress to focus more on creating jobs in the private sector.
 Governors were sharply divided on the merits of the $787 billion economic stimulus bill adopted by Congress last year with strong support from President Obama. And their differences colored their views on proposals for another round of job-creating legislation. 
 A handful of Republicans, including Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, denounced the 2009 law. 
 It was largely a ''waste of money that is now sustaining government at a time when we need to be shrinking government,'' Mr. Pawlenty said on the NBC program ''Meet the Press.''
 Mr. Pawlenty, a potential 2012 presidential candidate, described the logic of the stimulus program in derisory terms: ''We're going to take a dollar from you in the private sector, bring it into government, spin it around, take 5 to 20 percent for overhead, and redeploy it into the private economy and call that growth.''
 By contrast, three Democratic governors -- Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania and James E. Doyle of Wisconsin -- said federal money from the stimulus law had been a godsend. Without it, they said, the consequences of the recession would have been much worse.
 A Republican, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, agreed. 
 ''I have been the first of the Republican governors to come out and to support the stimulus money,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said on the ABC program ''This Week.'' ''I say to myself, this is terrific, and anyone that says that it hasn't created jobs, they should talk to the 150,000 people who have been getting jobs in California.''
 The Senate is scheduled to vote Monday on whether to cut off debate on a slimmed-down version of a jobs bill, devised by the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada.
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Republicans ''may well'' vote for the bill, though they want to have an opportunity to debate and amend it. 
 The House passed a much more ambitious and costly jobs bill in December. Mr. Reid's bill would cost $15 billion, about one-tenth of the cost of the bill passed by the House with no Republican support. Mr. Reid has made clear that his bill is the first of several economic-relief measures that he will try to push through the Senate this year.
 The bill offers employers an exemption from Social Security payroll taxes for each worker hired this year who has been unemployed for at least 60 days. It would also provide a tax credit to businesses that retain such workers for 52 weeks.
 However, Mr. Reid's bill does not include an extension of unemployment insurance benefits or health benefits for workers who have lost their jobs.
 Democratic governors said it was imperative for Congress to extend those benefits, as well as extra assistance provided to state Medicaid programs.
 Mr. Doyle said the extra Medicaid money had been invaluable to states, hospitals and nursing homes and to low-income people who depend on Medicaid. 
 Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said his state had benefited from the economic stimulus money. But he asserted, ''We could have created twice as many jobs with half as much money.''
 ''State government has benefited from the stimulus package, because it's poured in billions of dollars,'' Mr. Barbour said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''The problem is, we need private-sector jobs.''
 Mr. Barbour praised the idea of a payroll tax holiday for businesses that hire new workers.
 Mr. Doyle, like Mr. Barbour, said Congress should also take action to ''loosen credit for small businesses,'' many of which have difficulty getting loans, even if they are good credit risks.
 Mr. Obama recently proposed giving $30 billion to community banks to increase lending to small businesses.
 Mr. Rendell said the 2009 stimulus law had been highly effective. ''We could fill every baseball stadium in the country with people who got jobs or whose job was saved by the stimulus,'' he said.
 But Mr. Rendell said Mr. Obama had not adequately explained the value of the program. ''Ironically,'' he said, ''the best communicator in the history of political campaigning turned out in his first year in office to not communicate very well.''
 ''The stimulus has done a great job for America,'' Mr. Rendell said, ''but we lost the spin war. And once you lose it, it's hard to get it back.''
 Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said Congress was considering many good ideas to create jobs and revive the economy.
 But, Mr. Markell said, ''These solutions are being held hostage by petty bickering.''

HEADLINE: OBAMA TO SEEK FEDERAL POWER OVER INSURERS

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama will propose on Monday giving the federal government new power to block excessive rate increases by health insurance companies, as he rolls out comprehensive legislation to revamp the nation's health care system, White House officials said Sunday.
 The president's legislation aims to bridge differences between the bills adopted by the House and Senate late last year, and to frame his debate with Republicans over health policy at a televised meeting on Thursday. 
 By focusing on the effort to tighten regulation of insurance costs, a new element not included in either the House or Senate bills, Mr. Obama is seizing on outrage over recent premium increases of up to 39 percent announced by Anthem Blue Cross of California and moving to portray the Democrats' health overhaul as a way to protect Americans from profiteering insurers.
 Congressional Republicans have long denounced the Democrats' legislation as a ''government takeover'' of health care. And while they are likely to resist any expansion of federal authority over existing state regulators, they will face a tough balancing act at the meeting with the president to avoid appearing as if they are willing to allow steep premium increases like those by Anthem. 
 Republican leaders had not formally accepted the president's invitation to the meeting. But the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on Sunday that he would attend. ''I intend to be there, and my members will be there and ready to participate,'' Mr. McConnell said on Fox News. 
 The president's new provision also seemed to offer Republicans an opening for a new line of criticism -- that Mr. Obama and Democrats are anticipating the possibility of hefty price increases for health insurance even after their big legislation is adopted. 
 Mr. McConnell said the president, in proposing a new version of the Democrats' legislation, seemed to prejudging the outcome of the session. ''If they are going to lay out the plan they want to pass four days in advance,'' he said on Fox, ''What are we discussing on Thursday?'' 
 The White House has held details of Mr. Obama's bill extremely tight, leaving even top Democrats in Congress anxiously awaiting the text to be released Monday. But administration officials said it would incorporate legislation proposed last week by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, in response to the Anthem increases. Officials said it would ''help make sure that people are not unfairly subject to arbitrary premium hikes.''
 Anthem, California's largest for-profit insurer, has announced premium increases for nearly 700,000 customers, citing the soaring costs of medical care and the effects of a weak economy in which many younger and healthier people are dropping insurance. But the increases, far outpacing the rate of medical inflation, led to outrage among officials in Sacramento and Washington. 
 The Obama administration has sought to portray the situation as a warning of what could happen to many more Americans if Congress does not act to overhaul the health system. 
 The president's bill would grant the federal health and human services secretary new authority to review, and to block, premium increases by private insurers, potentially superseding state insurance regulators. The bill would create a new Health Insurance Rate Authority, made up of health industry experts that would issue an annual report setting the parameters for reasonable rate increases based on conditions in the market. 
 Officials said they envisioned the provision taking effect immediately after the health care bill is signed into law. 
 The legislation would call on the secretary of health and human services to work with state regulators to develop an annual review of rate increases, and if increases are deemed ''unjustified'' the secretary or the state could block the increase, order the insurer to change it, or even issue a rebate to beneficiaries.
 The new rate board would be composed of seven members, including consumer representatives, an insurance industry representative, a physician and other experts like health economists and actuaries, the White House said. The board's annual report would offer guidance to the public and states on whether rate increases should be approved. 
 But the focus on rate increases is also spotlighting questions about whether the Democrats' plans do enough to control rising health costs. Anthem and other insurers say they do not. 
 And it is unclear if the new powers or the rate board would have much long-term impact. The Democrats' legislation ultimately seeks to sharply curtail the existing individual insurance market in which companies like Anthem Blue Cross now sell their policies. Instead, such policies would be heavily regulated by the federal government and sold through new insurance exchanges, where consumers could compare prices and benefits packages and choose policies that best fit their needs. 
 The president's bill, like the measures adopted by the House and Senate, is expected to require most Americans to obtain insurance, and would provide new federal subsidies to help moderate-income people afford to buy private coverage. 
 And though Americans have heard officials in both parties talk for nearly a year about ''President Obama's health care plan,'' the legislation unveiled on Monday will actually be the first comprehensive proposal put forward by the White House. 
 Senator Feinstein, in an interview, pointed to the $12.2 billion in profits reaped by the five biggest private insurers in 2009. ''When you look at the profits in '09, up 56 percent over the year before,'' she said, ''you begin to understand that something is going on that is not in the interests of the American people.'' 
 Ms. Feinstein said that only 25 states allowed their insurance commissioners to regulate rates and that California was not one of them. ''For the life of me, I am not sure why not,'' she said. ''The time has come for the secretary of health and human services to step into this.'' 
 Mr. Obama has portrayed Thursday's meeting as a chance to break the partisan gridlock that has stalled any progress on health care this year. He has called on the Republicans to come forward with proposals of their own.
 But absent some dramatic turnabout by Republicans, Democratic leaders will have only one other possible path -- approving changes to the Senate bill by attaching them to an expedited budget measure, precluding a Republican filibuster in the Senate. Even many Democratic lawmakers are skeptical that the complex health care legislation can be moved through using that parliamentary maneuver.
 And many have been reluctant to say they would support a compromise measure without first knowing what was in it. 
 Leaders of the National Governors Association meeting in Washington on Sunday expressed frustration that they had been largely shut out of negotiations over the future of the health care system, even though they would be responsible for carrying out many of the changes envisioned by federal officials. They said they wanted more of a voice in shaping those changes.
 ''It's important that governors be at the table and bring our perspective to the debate,'' said Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont, a Republican who is chairman of the National Governors Association.
 Mr. Douglas said governors were deeply involved in discussions with Congress and Mr. Obama on the economic stimulus law adopted early last year. But he said, ''We have not had that kind of relationship in the current debate'' on health care.
 Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, said: ''Governors have something unique to contribute. Washington, D.C., is full of think tanks, theoreticians and advocacy groups. Governors are the ones whose feet are on the ground. We have a sense of what will work and what won't work. Our perspective is not the only one. But we can bring some practicality to this discussion.''
 Mr. Douglas, Mr. Bredesen and two other governors -- Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a Democrat, and Michael Rounds of South Dakota, a Republican -- spoke at a news conference at the winter meeting of the governors association. They and other governors plan to convey their concerns to Mr. Obama at a White House meeting on Monday.

HEADLINE: Obama to Propose New Reading and Math Standards

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In a proposed change to the No Child Left Behind law, the Obama administration would require states to adopt new academic standards to qualify for federal money from a $14 billion program that concentrates on impoverished students, the White House said Sunday. 
 The proposal, part of the administration's recommendations for a Congressional overhaul of the law, would require states to adopt ''college- and career-ready standards'' in reading and mathematics.
 The current law, signed by President George W. Bush in 2002, requires states to adopt ''challenging academic standards'' in reading and math to receive federal money for poor students under the program known as Title I, but leaves it up to states to decide what qualifies as ''challenging.'' 
 The result was that states set their standards at widely varied levels, some as rigorous as those used in high-performing countries like Japan, but others at far lower levels that lay out at best, mediocre expectations for their students.
 ''Because economic progress and educational achievement go hand in hand, educating every American student to graduate prepared for college and success in a new work force is a national imperative,'' the White House said in a statement. ''Meeting this challenge requires that state standards reflect a level of teaching and learning needed for students to graduate ready for success in college and careers.''
 President Obama was scheduled to announce the proposal in a meeting on Monday with governors who are gathered in Washington for the annual winter meeting of the National Governors Association.
 Since last year, 48 states have been collaborating to write common standards in math and reading, coordinated by the governors' group and with the encouragement of the White House. Texas and Alaska decided not to participate in that state-led effort.
 The common-standards effort has produced a draft, and earlier this month Kentucky became the first state to approve the substitution of the new standards for the state's own standards in the two subjects. 
 How successful or quickly the governors, legislatures, state boards of education and other authorities in other states will be in agreeing on adoption of the new standards is not clear.
 ''In better aligning the law to support college- and career-ready standards,'' the White House statement said, its proposed rewrite of the No Child Left Behind law would ''require all states to adopt and certify that they have college- and career-ready standards which may include common standards developed by a state-led consortium, as a condition of qualifying for Title I funding.''
 The four Democratic and Republican leaders of the House education committee announced last week that they were working together on the latest overhaul of the law.
 In its 2011 budget request earlier this month, the White House said it hoped to replace the law's much-criticized school rating system, known as adequate yearly progress, with a new accountability system.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''For Paterson Confidant, Fast Rise and Questions'' (front page, Feb. 17): 
 Rather than defining someone based on mistakes he made as a teenager, why not tell the story of a man who has completely transformed his life and is now making positive contributions to society? 
 In addition to the stigma of having a criminal record, people trying to find work upon their release from prison are faced with strict and counterproductive legal restrictions on the types of jobs they can have. Like David W. Johnson, an aide to Gov. David A. Paterson, these are people who have paid their debt to society and are trying to rebuild their lives. 
 While the article mentions some of the good work Mr. Johnson has been involved in, it does not acknowledge that civilized society believes fundamentally in second chances and offering people real opportunities to change. 
 Furthermore, this article gives no real reasons for Mr. Johnson not to have ascended to this position. In fact, New York State law bars employers from denying qualified job seekers a position based solely on a past criminal conviction, requiring them instead to make individualized assessments. 
 Denying someone a job on the basis of a criminal history essentially denies him or her the opportunity to contribute to the economy, the tax base, and the strength and safety of our communities. 
 Employers across the state should follow the governor's lead and realize that formerly incarcerated people are an untapped resource who need and want a chance to succeed and become productive citizens. All Governor Paterson did was open a door; Mr. Johnson did the rest. JoAnne Page

HEADLINE: Failing Grade

 BODY:
At least one in five adult workers in New York City lacks a high school diploma. New York State has the highest failure rate for adults who want to get an equivalent credential by taking the General Educational Development Test, or G.E.D. For the sake of these workers -- and New York's economy -- the city and state need to work together to rebuild the failing system that is supposed to prepare people for the G.E.D. 
 In her State of the City speech last week, Speaker Christine Quinn said the City Council is committed to fixing the system and outlined several new ideas. To fully rebuild the G.E.D. system, the State Legislature will also need to put a lot more money into the program. 
 New York would do well to emulate Iowa's highly successful preparation program. In 2008, 99 percent of test takers there passed the arduous exam. 
 The secret is this: People in Iowa are given adequate preparation. First they are required to take a diagnostic test. Depending on how they do, they are offered literacy courses or other instruction and given official practice tests before they take the exam.
 New Yorkers generally find it difficult to find adequate information about the test and where it is given. Many turn up on test day knowing almost nothing about the G.E.D., including the fact that the test lasts about seven hours. 
 In her speech, Ms. Quinn discussed some ways to address these problems. She said the city and its private-sector partners will soon launch a central Web site that will familiarize people with the exam, direct them to literacy training and ensure that each test taker reserves one seat only. (Right now, too many people are being turned away from the exam because of multiple bookings.) 
 In addition, Ms. Quinn has proposed that people who sign up for the exam be required to take the official practice test, so G.E.D. providers could better assess their abilities and recommend remediation if needed. 
 Ms. Quinn also has proposed that people without diplomas who apply for services under the federally financed job training and placement program, known here as Workforce1, be directed to G.E.D. services. The Council should not stop there. It should make sure that many more of the people who are now required to undergo job training in exchange for welfare benefits get into solid G.E.D. programs. 
 That's the best way to advance New Yorkers' skills and their chances of finding good jobs.

HEADLINE: How the G.O.P. Can Fix Health Care

BYLINE: By CHARLES KOLB. 
CHARLES KOLB, former domestic policy adviser to President George H. W. Bush and president of the nonpartisan Committee for Economic Development

 BODY:
HEALTH care reform should have two critical goals: reducing costs and covering more people. To meet them, Democrats and Republicans must abandon simplistic, ideologically driven proposals that animate each party's base. Liberals cannot insist on Medicare for all, and conservatives cannot insist on markets for all, plus tort reform. Neither approach will work. 
 Medicare is an inherently inflationary fee-for-service system that rewards volume, not value. Market-based strategies cannot cover the uninsured or prevent some insurance companies from covering only healthy Americans. 
 Our existing employer-sponsored system -- a pre-World War II dinosaur awaiting extinction -- offers most Americans little, if any, real choice among competing insurance plans. Both parties should jettison it in favor of giving Americans better health care choices.
 To do this, Congress should not micromanage people's health care decisions by imposing price controls or setting up more bureaucracy. Rather, it should introduce competition to the insurance market by creating a system of regional exchanges, similar to the one now operated by the federal government for its employees, to allow everyone the opportunity to choose an insurance plan. Then Americans would be able to shop for health insurance and pocket what they save by choosing lower-priced plans. Appropriate risk adjustment -- a mechanism by which insurers who cover more sick people are compensated by insurers who cover fewer of them -- could reduce the incentive of some insurance companies to sign up only the healthy. 
 Congress should also end the current tax exemption for employer-sponsored insurance coverage. This change would encourage people to pay more attention to the price of their health insurance. And it would provide the money that will be needed to help underwrite coverage for the uninsured. 
 Finally, no backroom deals -- for pharmaceutical companies, individual members of Congress or anyone else. 
 We have a rare opportunity to lower America's health care costs, extend coverage and provide better care. What's uncertain is whether our bipartisan leadership is up to the task.

HEADLINE: Climate Change

 BODY:
Yvo de Boer's resignation on Thursday after nearly four tumultuous years as chief steward of the United Nations' climate change negotiations has deepened a sense of pessimism about whether the world can ever get its act together on global warming. Mr. de Boer was plainly exhausted by endless bickering among nations and frustrated by the failure of December's talks in Copenhagen to deliver the prize he had worked so hard for: a legally binding treaty committing nations to mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases. 
 His resignation comes at a fragile moment in the campaign to combat climate change. The Senate is stalemated over a climate change bill. The disclosure of apparently trivial errors in the U.N.'s 2007 climate report has given Senate critics fresh ammunition. And without Mr. de Boer, the slim chances of forging a binding agreement at the next round of talks in December in Cancun, Mexico, seem slimmer still. 
 Yet his departure is hardly the death knell for international negotiations. It is not proof that such talks are of no value or that the U.N. negotiating framework in place since 1992 should be abandoned. Even Copenhagen, messy as it was, brought rich and poor nations closer together than they had been. And more than 90 countries representing 83 percent of the world's greenhouse gases promised, at least notionally, to reduce their emissions. 
 But his resignation does remind us that the U.N. process is tiring, cumbersome and slow. It reinforces the notion that some parallel negotiating track will be necessary if the world is to have any hope of achieving the reductions scientists believe are necessary to avert the worst consequences of climate change. 
 The Copenhagen pledges, even if all of them are met, will merely stabilize global emissions by 2020. What really matters is what happens after 2020, whether the world can achieve reductions of at least 50 percent by midcentury. That won't happen without big cuts by big emitters like the United States, the European Union, China, India and Brazil. 
 Even before Copenhagen, global leaders were exploring parallel tracks. Former President George W. Bush brought together some of the big emitters, and President Obama has expanded on this idea with the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, a group of 17 countries that plans to meet regularly. The Group of 20 has put climate change high on its agenda, and bilateral efforts -- technology exchanges between China and the United States, for instance -- are under discussion. 
 The underlying thought is that the ultimate goal is a safe planet, and that absent a top-down global treaty, that goal is probably best achieved by aggressive, bottom-up national strategies to reduce emissions. Not that these are a sure thing; the United States, embarrassingly, has no national strategy. Until it gets one, it can hardly lecture anyone else. Nor will the world stand a ghost of a chance of bringing emissions under control.

HEADLINE: How the G.O.P. Can Fix Health Care

BYLINE: By JAMES P. PINKERTON. 
JAMES P. PINKERTON, fellow at the New America Foundation and former domestic policy aide for , Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush

 BODY:
WHEN Americans think about health care, they think first of health, not finance. They go to the doctor to get well, not to show off their government-issued insurance card. So President Obama's health care reform plan was doomed from the moment the American people figured out that his goal was to spend less on health care. 
 While the president's idea of ''bending the curve'' on health care means cuts in Medicare, to the American people bending the curve means living better and longer. To the folks on Main Street, it means not appointing Kafkaesque committees to measure ''quality-adjusted life years'' but fostering a vibrant climate of scientific research and opening a wider pipeline for new medicines. 
 Sixty-seven percent of Americans say they are not getting enough medical treatment, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data. But we want not just more care; we want better health. Thanks to the public-private effort that decades ago brought us the polio vaccine, we no longer spend money on wheelchairs and iron lungs. We could do the same today for other diseases. Finding a cure is cheaper than paying for care.
 Our medical industries can improve our economy as well as our health. As Robert Fogel, the Nobel-winning economic historian, wrote last year, health care is ''the growth industry of the 21st century.'' We won't escape from the recession by provoking a recession within the health care sector. When people are healthier and more productive, they will need less chronic care, and tax revenues will rise out of the expanding economic pie. 
 A ''more health'' plan is a win for individual health, a win for economic growth and, yes, a win for the cause of long-term health savings.

HEADLINE: Gender Trade-Offs

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Changing gender roles have created some rather complicated choices, and that helps explain why it's hard to assess progress toward gender equality, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
It's pretty hard to get something for nothing. That's one reason why economists like to analyze trade-offs.
Changing gender roles in our society have created some rather complicated trade-offs, and that helps explain why it's hard to assess progress toward gender equality.
Women on nonfarm payrolls - a measure that includes part-time workers - now slightly outnumber men. Employers find women attractive to hire in part because women typically earn less than men with the same education.
A recent comparative analysis of 21 countries by two sociologists at the University of Washington, Becky Pettit and Jennifer Hook, reports that women's labor-force participation tends to be lower in countries where their earnings relative to men are higher.
For instance, in Germany and Italy, a smaller percentage of women work for pay than in the United States, but those who are employed earn more, on average, relative to men. Women who overcome the obstacles to employment there tend to be high earners.
Across all countries, overall inequalities in wage income influence average differences in men's and women's earnings. So do public policies such as child care provisions that help adults cope with trade-offs between paid and unpaid work - and, more broadly, between economic independence and family commitment.
These trade-offs remain sharply significant in the United States.
Median weekly earnings for women working full-time came to 80 cents for every dollar a man earns in 2008, compared to about 62 cents in 1970. But women are much less likely than men to work full time, year round, because they typically take time out to care for family members. One study that examines differences in earnings over a 15-year period shows women earning, on average, less than 40 cents for every dollar a man earns.
Women who don't marry or have kids earn about the same as men with the same qualifications. Going without a family life seems a rather steep price to pay for equality.
Men experience a different, often less costly trade-off: Becoming a parent typically leads them to increase their hours of market work. They give up some leisure and some family time, but their earnings go up, along with their lifelong career prospects.
Married men devote significantly more time to housework and child care than they used to. But many fathers remain unmarried, and the risk of divorce remains relatively high, between 40 and 50 percent.
Divorced men are more likely to remarry than divorced women, and often successfully find someone younger and healthier than themselves who will take care of them as they age.
Some argue that the advent of no-fault divorce laws made it too easy for men to leave marriages, increasing women's economic vulnerability. But the cost of staying in a bad marriage is quite high. Analysis of differences across states in implementation of no-fault rules reveals that they significantly lowered both women's suicide rates and domestic violence, including murders of wives.
College-educated women seem better positioned than other women to have their cake and eat it too. Relatively high earnings make them attractive to potential marriage partners and improve their bargaining power, which helps them persuade men to take on more responsibilities for family care.
Once married, they can use their earnings to buy high-quality substitutes for their own time, often from less-educated immigrant women providing domestic services, child care and elder care.
Partly because they tend to marry at a later age, when both they and their partners are more mature, college-educated women are less likely to divorce. If they do divorce, however, they're better able to hire a good lawyer.
These factors may help explain why women are now more likely than men to enter and complete college. The access to better jobs that a diploma provides helps them improve the trade-off between independence and commitment.
That trade-off remains far more costly for less-educated women, who face a high risk of poverty when they become mothers.

HEADLINE: Tax Tips for Same-Sex Couples

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: Gay couples have complicated financial lives, and preparing their tax returns is no exception. In this post, we offer some tips on what to keep in mind during tax season. 

 BODY:
Gay couples have complicated financial lives, and preparing tax returns is no exception.
Since the federal government doesn't recognize same-sex marriage, gay couples who are living in states that do recognize their various legal unions must still file separate federal returns. That requires more record-keeping and planning than their heterosexual counterparts -- and oftentimes, gay couples will have to pay more to an accountant to prepare their returns.
But the consequences aren't all negative. By remaining unmarried, some same-sex couples will avoid the so-called marriage penalty. This occurs when a couple's combined income pushes them into a higher tax bracket than if they had remained single. Or, they may qualify for more tax deductions or credits that phase out as their income rises.
On the other hand, plenty of same-sex couples end up paying higher tax bills than their heterosexual married counterparts, including those with a stay-at-home parent. That's because the tax code tends to favor married couples with disparate incomes or a nonworking spouse.
No matter which category you fall into, tax experts say the best way to minimize the tax bite is to look at both partners as an economic unit. If the higher-earning partner won't get the full child tax credit, should the lower earner take it? Who should file as head of household, which has more favorable rates than the single filing status?
"Gay taxpayers will do best when they look at their tax results as a household, and not as individuals," said Tina Salandra, a certified public accountant in New York.
Just be prepared to spend some extra time strategizing. "If you are filing separately but are really leading very joint lives, there are many extra things you need to do," said Jeff Pretsfelder, a senior tax analyst at the tax and accounting business of Thomson Reuters.
We list some of those items below, along with several other things you need to keep in mind:
New Items for 2009 If you bought a home and expect to be eligible for the home buyer's tax credit, remember that you must split the $8,000 credit with your partner. "The I.R.S. was very clear that if two unmarried people or a same-sex couple buy a home, they need to split the credit," Ms. Salandra said. But there is a potential benefit: Since the home buyers' credit phases out as your income rises, and same-sex couples don't combine their income on their federal returns, the lower-wage earner may still qualify for half the credit even though the higher earner is above the limit, she added.
Separately, the Internal Revenue Service issued guidance in a memo from its chief counsel's office that clarifies how much mortgage interest is deductible for people who own homes jointly. Taxpayers who file as single or married filing jointly can generally deduct all of their mortgage interest on up to $1 million in mortgage debt and $100,000 in home equity debt (or half those amounts if married filing separately).
Some same-sex couples - or the professionals advising them - have interpreted that to mean that partner could deduct interest on up to $1 million in debt. But in a memo in March 2009, the I.R.S. said that the $1 million limit applies to the home, and not each taxpayer (at least in a situation where two taxpayers co-own their only residence). So a gay couple who jointly owned a Manhattan apartment could deduct interest on only up to $1 million in debt, not $2 million. "That is incredibly significant for gay couples, especially in a high real estate market like New York City," Ms. Salandra said.
Filing Status. Unlike heterosexual married couples, same-sex couples can choose to have one partner file a federal return as "head of household," where tax rates are lower than filing as single. To qualify, you must be unmarried or considered unmarried, have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home and live with a "qualifying person," like a dependent child. So generally, only one partner (who is also the legal parent of a dependent child) can claim this status on a federal return. But it's not impossible for two partners to claim head of household -- one partner, for instance, may be supporting an elderly parent, while the other is supporting a child.
It often makes sense for the higher-earning partner to file as head of household, but not always.
States operate according to their own rules. And not all states that recognize same-sex marriage extend that recognition for tax purposes. New York, for instance, says it recognizes gay marriage, but it doesn't allow married couples to file joint state returns.
But if you live in a state that recognizes your union -- whether you're married, registered domestic partners or part of a civil union -- you will probably be required to file joint returns (or married/civil union/domestic partner filing separately). But each state varies, so be sure to evaluate which filing status will save you the most money.
Strategies If you have joint accounts, property or children, the question then becomes who should deduct what and what filing status each partner should take, if one or both have the option of filing as head of household.
Generally speaking, the person who pays the expense gets the deduction, said Chris Kollaja, an accountant and partner at A.L. Nella in San Francisco. For instance, if you paid 60 percent of the mortgage payments, you could deduct that percentage of interest, while your partner could deduct the remaining 40 percent. But to take a deduction, you need to have an ownership stake in the property.
"Like any two people who are roommates that don't file a joint return, there is the question of who pays for certain things, and there is a need to document that," Mr. Pretsfelder said.
Extra Paperwork When it comes to jointly held accounts or property, you should call your bank or brokerage to get two copies of the forms that report any sort of miscellaneous income (including the 1099 form, which lists any income earned other than wages, salaries or tips, or the 1098 form, which lists mortgage interest paid). The banks usually send out only one form to the person whose Social Security number is listed first, which doesn't affect heterosexual couples filing jointly.
If, say, you split the interest income collected on a joint savings account for tax purposes, you will want to attach a letter to each partner's tax return, along with a copy of the relevant form. The letter should state that the accounts are held jointly, and that you're splitting the interest, the dividends or whatever the item.
"The partner whose Social Security number is not on the tax form may be challenged by the I.R.S., saying we have no records," Ms. Salandra said. "That is all remedied by a letter and documentation that shows the other taxpayer's name on the joint account."
Gifts While heterosexual couples can freely transfer money, property or expensive cars and gifts to one another without tax consequences, same-sex couples cannot: anything valued above $13,000 per calendar year is considered a taxable gift. So Ms. Salandra recommends that her clients keep a joint bank account to pay their joint expenses -- and that each partner keep records of how much he or she contributed to the account.
"I caution them not to put more than the gift limit over than what the other person was putting in," Ms. Salandra said. If you did give your partner a gift valued at more than $13,000 last year, you are required to file a gift tax return by April 15, and the amount will be counted against your $1 million lifetime exemption.
Heterosexual married couples "can arrange their affairs any way they want without a tax burden, and generally that doesn't happen for gay and lesbians," Mr. Kollaja said.

Professional Help It often pays to get professional help, especially from an accountant who is well versed in these issues. PridePlanners, a group of financial planners who serve gay and lesbian clients, has a list of providers by state.
But same-sex couples can expect to pay more in tax preparation fees. This is especially true for couples who live in states that recognize their unions and require them to file their state returns jointly (or married/civil union/domestic partner filing separately). That's because the couple must first file separate federal tax returns (as single or head of household). But the tax preparer must also create a dummy federal tax return using a married filing status, so that they can use that data for filing the joint state return.
While a heterosexual married couple needs to file only two returns, a same-sex married couple living in a gay union state must file three returns, but technically fill out four. (In ourarticle that tallied up the extra costs that same-sex couples incur over the course of their lifetimes, we found that same-sex couples could spend around $12,300 more on tax preparation fees than their heterosexual counterparts).

HEADLINE: Nathaniel Rothschild Calls for Ban on Sovereign Default Swaps

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: Nathan Rothschild, the heir to the British branch of the family and former co-president of Atticus Capital, told Les Echos in an article published Monday that he thought C.D.S. for sovereign debt should be banned.

 BODY:
Nathaniel Rothschild, the heir of the British branch of the family and former co-chairman of Atticus Capital, told Les Echos that he thought credit default swaps, or C.D.S.'s, for sovereign debt should be banned.
Asked about the role of "speculators" in the Greek crisis, Mr. Rothschild told the newspaper it was "very, very big."
"It all happened too easily," he said. "Governments should take measures, for example forbidding C.D.S.'s on sovereign debt. I think this crisis is 'much ado about nothing.' "
Mr. Rothschild went on:Greece represents 2.7 percent of the euro zone's G.D.P. There must be a solution, and the European countries will find it together. They can, because Europe's primary deficit isn't doing so bad compared to the United States, Japan and others.His comments took a different tack than those of George Soros, who, in a piece in The Financial Times, was less sanguine about the future of the euro zone.

HEADLINE: Daring to Think 'Private Jet' Again

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HAPPY days are not quite here again in the business aviation industry, but at least there are some breaks in the clouds.
 Gingerly, some business travelers are venturing back into private aircraft after the battered economy -- and a public outcry against that perk of fat cats, the corporate jet -- walloped the general aviation industry starting in 2008.
 The signs of a small and tentative rebound are discernible. In January, business aircraft flights, as monitored by the aviation research firm Argus, rose 5.3 percent over January 2009. 
 Starting late last year, business jet operators saw ''a very distinct, small, consistent upturn in demand,'' said Fred Reid, president of Flexjet, a company owned by Bombardier that sells fractional shares in aircraft, as well as charter flights and so-called jet cards for buying flight time in 25-hour blocks.
 But the market dynamics have been shifting. Big publicly held companies are still wary of using corporate jets, even if there is a clear economic justification for, say, flying a group of executives or technicians to places not well served by commercial airlines on trips where time is of the essence.
 In 2008 and 2009, as the economy stumbled, some major companies sold or sharply trimmed their fleets. In many cases, they shifted to less expensive (and less ostentatious) fractional-share jet ownership or chose to book charter flights, or both. Others simply dropped out of corporate aviation entirely.
 One result was a glut of late-model business jets at fire-sale prices on the used market last year. Industry officials say that surplus has begun to shrink, and that prices of used planes, while still depressed, are rising again. 
 But deliveries of new aircraft have not yet reflected a rebound, as credit remains tight and companies continue to cut back on flying hours in general, according to data released last week by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, a trade group. The industry, long dominated by American companies and technology, has laid off tens of thousands of workers since 2008 and hasn't indicated it will be hiring anytime soon. 
 Last year was a particularly bad one after five years of record growth. So even though the industry slowly regained some ground in the second half of the year, shipments of business jets were still off 33.7 percent compared with 2008, to a total of 870. Shipments of turboprops, the high-end propeller planes increasingly used for corporate flying, were off 17.6 percent, to 441, the trade group said. 
 This year, however, ''flying hours are on the rise'' and inquiries about new orders are growing, Robert Wilson, the trade group's chairman, said in an industry briefing last week. Last year, billing for all general aviation planes, jets as well as piston-driven aircraft, was off 21.4 percent, at $19.5 billion.
 Flexjet and others have been gaining some ground by emphasizing the benefits of flexibility, as opposed to outright ownership of a plane or fleet. At the same time, the continuing deterioration of the commercial air travel system is a big marketing advantage. 
 As any business traveler knows, it's far more time-consuming and difficult now to get to or from midsize and smaller markets, given reduced flight schedules and capacity. Then there are the rising airline fees and the security delays. 
 ''One of the things that has happened is that people, for whatever reasons -- financial distress, concern at the board level about public and employee perception -- had to go to commercial aviation. And for people who hadn't done that in a while, they're suddenly reminded of how utterly, dreadfully inefficient that is,'' Mr. Reid said.
 Operating on surveys showing that nearly eight of 10 business jets fly with four or fewer passengers, and over 90 percent of those trips are for three hours or less, a start-up company called JetSuite last fall began providing flights by the hour or day. JetSuite now has seven new Phenom 100s, entry-level light jets made by Embraer. JetSuite operates primarily in California and other parts of the West. 
 In the past, companies would purchase big business jets because of the need for occasional ''superlong-haul flights'' overseas, said Alex Wilcox, JetSuite's chief executive. 
 ''It was often a matter of ramp ego, of who had bragging rights to the biggest plane,'' he said, even if that plane was not efficient for most of the company's flying needs, which are often short haul.

HEADLINE: Medical Paper Trail Takes Electronic Turn

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
As far back as I can remember, medical care has been paper-driven. When you see a new doctor or return to one you haven't seen for a while, you are asked to complete a written medical history that includes every illness or condition you have ever had (along with operations and their dates), every drug and over-the-counter medication and supplement you take, the major illnesses and causes of death of members of your family, and perhaps other medical facts of possible interest to the doctor.
 If you are able to recall and record such facts fully and accurately, especially if you are currently ill, injured or in pain, you're a better patient than I'll ever be. Yet today some 80 percent of practicing physicians rely entirely on this kind of paper trail -- patient records that can be misplaced or lost, or unavailable in an emergency.
 But the future holds potential for a major improvement that capitalizes on modern technology. It goes by different names depending on who maintains it -- electronic health record, electronic medical record, personal health record -- and its promise goes way beyond doctors' having to rely on the incomplete or inaccurate memories of their patients. 
 President Obama's economic stimulus included $19.2 billion for health information technology, and a number of hospital systems around the country are taking advantage of this financial incentive and investing their own money to foster the creation and use of electronic records that are expected to improve the quality, efficiency and safety of medical care. (One such effort, at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, was the subject of an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine last month.)
 In an editorial in that publication in 2007, Dr. Cara B. Litvin, then a resident physician at New York University Medical Center, wrote that too often ''care was suboptimal simply because records were not available.''
 Dr. Litvin, now an internist at the Medical University of South Carolina who teaches doctors how to improve care using electronic records, pointed out that the Veterans Health Administration has used its computerized patient record system for the past decade, and its doctors report that it has greatly improved the care of some eight million veterans. Prescriptions, laboratory tests, studies, consults, reports and progress notes from all visits by patients to any Veterans Affairs hospital are stored in each patient's electronic record.
 With privacy constraints in place to prevent unauthorized access to electronic health records -- a requirement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 -- patients could get electronic copies of their own medical records and have them sent directly to a doctor, hospital or other designated recipient.
 Currently, however, the various hospital and medical groups that have gone electronic ''speak different languages and cannot transmit information between systems,'' Dr. Atul Gawande, the Harvard-based surgeon and the author most recently of ''The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right'' (Metropolitan, 2009), said in an interview. ''Integrating the systems so that we can send information across the country is the holy grail.'' 
 The Benefits
 A digital account of one's medical records can do far more than relieve doctors' dependence on unreliable memories. It can also have these benefits:
 Avoid duplication of tests, from blood tests to M.R.I.'s. If you've already been tested recently by one provider, the results can be accessed electronically by another doctor within the same system. This can sometimes be life-saving in a crisis situation. If a test has a built-in hazard, not having to repeat it enhances patient safety. Or if a test must be repeated, the doctor can see immediately whether an important change has occurred since the last test. 
 Reduce medical errors. Within a hospital system, having a record of complications that accompany a particular procedure can help the system identify and rectify the problem before more patients suffer needlessly. An electronic system could reduce pharmacy errors that result from misreading a doctor's prescription and misplaced decimal points and warn of drug allergies and potential drug interactions in individual patients. If a drug is recalled, with an electronic record every patient on the drug can be alerted quickly.
 Make surgery safer. Dr. Gawande said he had just finished four operations, each of which had more than two dozen things to do or think about afterward, like lab tests, blood clot checks, antibiotics, bed arrangements, nursing instructions and so forth. When he and his colleagues had to rely on memory, some important steps were usually forgotten. But with an electronic reminder all now get done. 
 Encourage better self-care. ''Well-informed patients are better able to participate in their own care,'' Dr. Steven Shea of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons said in an interview. If patients have access to critical parts of their health records, especially their test results, they may be ''more likely to engage in healthy behavior and more likely to bring symptoms to the attention of their doctors,'' Dr. Shea said, adding, ''In my experience, the better informed patients are, the more efficient and productive the medical visit can be.''
 Improve care of chronic illnesses. Fewer than half of patients with chronic ailments regularly take prescribed medications or get the periodic checkups their doctors recommend. An electronic system can alert the physician to noncompliance and when it is time for another office visit. Electronic reminders and prompts can help patients get better preventive care, Dr. Litvin said, like when they should have a colonoscopy, get a flu shot or get certain lab tests. Electronic records may also help to reduce waste in the system by identifying the most effective treatment regimens for common conditions.
 Identify the right drug and dose. In the not too distant future, as DNA-based variations in drug responses are identified, electronic records will enable doctors to choose the most effective medication and dose for each patient. For example, in determining a safe and effective dose of the blood thinner Coumadin, months of risky trial and error could be eliminated by tailoring the dose to each patient's unique genome.
 The Concerns
 Privacy concerns have been the main deterrent to ''wiring'' medical records. But Dr. Litvin notes that the information is password-protected, and that insurers and employers would not have access to a patient's electronic medical record unless the patient authorized it. ''The benefits to providing quality medical care way outweigh any privacy issues,'' she said.
 As with any innovation, there is a learning curve associated with establishing and using electronic records. ''There was a lot of pain in adopting an electronic system,'' Dr. Gawande said. ''But now that it is up and running, none of us would go back, not for a minute. A well-designed system can dramatically improve medicine's ability to get better results.''

HEADLINE: President of San Francisco Fed Sees Slow Recovery, Especially in Jobs

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The United States faces the prospect of a jobless recovery, with painfully slow employment growth and the economy not operating at its full potential until 2013, a top Federal Reserve official said Monday.
 The official, Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that a sharp increase in worker productivity was ''here to stay.'' 
 She predicted that unemployment, now at 9.7 percent, would fall to 9.25 percent by the end of the year and around 8 percent by the end of 2011. And she described the current inflation rate as ''undesirably low.'' 
 The Fed has repeatedly said that it would not start to tighten credit for at least several months. When the time comes, Ms. Yellen said, the Fed will probably start by raising the interest rate it pays on bank reserves. Only after that will it gradually sell the Treasury securities and mortgage-related assets it bought to hold down long-term interest rates and support the recovery. 
 Markets are acutely interested in the timing and sequence of the Fed's withdrawal of monetary stimulus, particularly after the Fed raised the rate it charges banks for short-term loans last week, a largely technical move but a crucial step toward the normalization of lending. 
 Ms. Yellen, who was chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration and is one of the best-known economists among the Fed's leaders, spoke at the University of San Diego. In hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is to present the central bank's semiannual report on monetary policy to Congress. 
 Ms. Yellen offered a fairly grim outlook. Although gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the last quarter -- the best gain in six years -- the improvement was attributable to businesses reducing their inventories, rather than growth in sales, making a ''V-shaped recovery'' unlikely, she said.
 She estimated that the economy would grow about 3.5 percent this year and 4.5 percent next year. Although the Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate to near zero in December 2008 and made big loans and asset purchases, Ms. Yellen said, ''all in all, monetary policy can't give the same kick to the economy that it delivered in past recoveries.'' 
 Ms. Yellen also tried to explain why Okun's Law, which describes the relationship between unemployment and changes in output, ''let us down big time in 2009.'' Given the lag between potential and actual output, unemployment should be lower than it is.
 Ms. Yellen said she believed that the culprit was an increase in business efficiency and labor productivity.
 ''Strapped by tight credit and plummeting sales, businesses have overhauled the way they manage supply chains, inventory, production practices and staffing,'' she said. ''Stores don't order merchandise unless they think they can sell it right away. Manufacturers and builders don't produce unless they have buyers lined up. My business contacts describe this as a paradigm shift and they believe it's permanent.'' 
 Ms. Yellen believes that ''economic slack and downward pressure on wages and prices are pushing inflation down.''
 Large federal deficits have helped to buffer the economy from the financial crisis and the recession, but if they persist into the recovery, they could push interest rates up and absorb private savings that would be otherwise used in productive investments, Ms. Yellen said. 
 Still, she said there was ''no evidence that government deficits cause high inflation in advanced economies with independent central banks, like the Fed.'' If anything, she said, Japan -- which has run big deficits for years -- has ''suffered from persistent deflation, not inflation.''
 She called the underutilization in the American economy ''the most worrisome challenge for price stability over the next few years.'' 
 One of the problems cited by Ms. Yellen was the bleak state of the commercial real estate market, where mortgage-backed defaults and losses have been rising. 
 On Monday, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote to Mr. Bernanke and other federal regulators, asking them to report on efforts to stabilize that market.

HEADLINE: Applications For Help On Heat Bills Rise by 15%

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
The number of households applying for home heating assistance has climbed to record levels for the third straight year, rising by 15 percent to a projected 8.8 million this winter, state energy officials said Monday. This compares with almost 7.7 million recipients last year and 5.7 million in 2008. 
 Average heating costs have declined slightly since 2009, and the increase in applications reflects, in part, the mounting troubles of those suffering prolonged unemployment, including many people who had not sought the aid in the past, said Mark Wolfe, director of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association, which represents state aid officials in Washington.
 Under the federally financed aid program, known as Liheap, states provide low-income applicants with grants averaging about $500 -- or considerably more in colder northern states where heating a home with fuel oil can easily run to $1,800 or more for the winter. Later in the season, some people in dire straits also receive smaller emergency grants. 
 Congress approved $5.1 billion for the energy program, the same as last year. In the fall, with indications of another jump in demand, some states reduced the benefit amounts to stretch the money further. Unless Congress votes to provide extra money, state officials said, some states may cut off applications in the next month or two and scale back aid for weatherization and summer cooling. 
 A large majority of recipients are low-income elderly and disabled people and families living beneath the federal poverty line, which is $22,050 for a family of four. But households with incomes up to 150 percent or even double the poverty line are eligible in many states and, this year, applications have risen from people who are newly on the borderline of poverty. 
 ''New applicants run the gamut from fixed-income seniors to an increase in the working poor to those of modest means who have lost their jobs or been displaced from homes they may have lost to foreclosure,'' said Phil Hailer, spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development. 
 In Massachusetts, where applications are up by at least 15 percent over last year, the state has reduced the maximum benefit amount to $1,240, from $1,495 in 2009. 
 Among larger states, aid applications have climbed particularly in California (17 percent), Michigan (28 percent), New Jersey (24 percent) and Wisconsin (20 percent), according to data provided to the national association of assistance directors. 
 Many states forbid utility shutoffs in the winter, and, with or without aid, struggling families sometimes put off payments, building up arrears. Officials expect a surge in shutoffs of gas and electricity in the spring, when the moratoriums end and consumers find themselves owing large amounts.

HEADLINE: Domingo to Undergo Surgery After Suffering Abdominal Pain

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Placido Domingo, the peripatetic tenor, conductor and opera house impresario, suffered severe abdominal pain while performing in Tokyo last week and will undergo ''preventive surgery,'' his spokeswoman said on Monday. 
 He is hoping to miss no more than six weeks of performances, returning for a late-March run in the title role of ''Simon Boccanegra'' at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin, said the spokeswoman, Nancy Seltzer.
 Before then his schedule called for a series of performances in ''Tamerlano'' at the Royal Opera House in London and a Zurich Opera performance of ''Boccanegra.'' The ''Tamerlano'' performances have already been canceled. 
 Mr. Domingo, 69, suffered ''intense pain and discomfort'' while singing and conducting in Tokyo, Ms. Seltzer said. The pain lasted for more than a week, she said in a statement. He traveled to New York for a medical examination, and doctors recommended the surgery.
 She declined to characterize the nature of the surgery or what condition it was designed to prevent. ''I know he's a public figure, but aren't certain things allowed to be private?'' she said. She said the surgery would take place in New York, without identifying the hospital, and that the operation had not been scheduled.
 Mr. Domingo displays an extraordinary energy as he travels the world, leading performances in the pit and displaying a still-healthy tenor voice. He is also general director of the Los Angeles Opera and the Washington National Opera, prompting periodic concerns over whether he is spread too thin. Those worries intensified during a recent round of financial troubles at both companies.
 Officials of the companies and Mr. Domingo's supporters reject the notion that Mr. Domingo's busy schedule detracts from running the companies, and point out that the financial problems at arts institutions are widespread in the recession.
 A spokesman for the Los Angeles Opera did not immediately respond to a question about whether Mr. Domingo's surgery would affect any official duties. A Washington National Opera spokesman said Mr. Domingo remained ''in close contact'' with the company's team ''at all times.''
 ''Knowing Mr. Domingo's tireless commitment to the company, we have every expectation that he will continue to carry out his responsibilities with the same passion and dedication that he brings to each of his roles,'' the Washington National Opera said in an e-mailed statement. ''We wish him a speedy recovery.'' 
 As Ms. Seltzer put it in an e-mail message: ''Please know he's not having brain surgery, and, knowing Placido, he will be working as they roll the gurney into surgery and again as he leaves recovery.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the announcement that the tenor Placido Domingo would undergo surgery after experiencing severe abdominal pain last week referred imprecisely to plans for the production of ''Tamerlano'' scheduled for next month at the Royal Opera House in London. While Mr. Domingo's performances have been canceled, the production of ''Tamerlano'' has not been. (Kurt Streit will replace Mr. Domingo in the opera.)

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Takes a Close Look at the Unwired

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER and JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
For many Americans, having high-speed access to the Internet at home is as vital as electricity, heat and water. And yet about one-third of the population, 93 million people, have elected not to connect. 
 A comprehensive survey by the Federal Communications Commission found several barriers to entry, with broadband prices looming largest. The commission will release the findings on Tuesday and employ them as it submits a national broadband plan to Congress next month.
 Of the 93 million persons without broadband identified by the study, about 80 million are adults. Small numbers of them access the Internet by dial-up connections, or outside the home at places like offices or libraries, but most never log on anywhere. In a world of digital information, these people are ''at a distinct disadvantage,'' said John Horrigan, who oversaw the survey for the F.C.C.
 Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the F.C.C., is promoting faster and more pervasive broadband infrastructure as a tenet of economic growth and democracy.
 The study, conducted last fall, interviewed 5,005 residents by telephone. It indicates that the gap in access is no longer between slower dial-up and faster broadband; the overwhelming majority of people who have Internet access have broadband.
 ''Overall Internet penetration has been steady in the mid-70 to upper 70 percent range over the last five years,'' Mr. Horrigan said in an interview on Monday. ''Now we're at a point where, if you want broadband adoption to go up by any significant measure, you really have to start to eat into the segment of non-Internet-users.''
 Those nonusers are disproportionately older and more likely to live in rural areas. Those with household incomes of less than $50,000 are ''much less likely'' to have broadband access, according to the F.C.C. report. 
 Asked about the reasons for not having broadband at home, almost half of respondents cited a prohibitive cost, and almost as many said they were uncomfortable using a computer. Forty-five percent answered ''yes'' to the statement, ''I am worried about all the bad things that can happen if I use the Internet.'' Others said they viewed the Internet as a waste of time. 
 Respondents were able to give multiple answers, and most did. Consequently, ''policy solutions that provide comprehensive aid to people are most likely to have the most payoff,'' Mr. Horrigan said.
 Twelve percent of those surveyed who had not adopted broadband said that they could not connect to broadband where they lived. Because this figure is self-reported by the residents, it may not be entirely accurate.
 The F.C.C. was mandated by Congress to produce a detailed plan with specific recommendations to hasten the national adoption of broadband in the United States. The plan is expected to be unveiled by the F.C.C. on March 17. It will recommend, among other elements, an expansion of broadband adoption from the current 65 percent to more than 90 percent, Mr. Genachowski said in a blog post on an F.C.C. Web site last week.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''What's Wrong With Us?'' (column, Feb. 16): 
 Bob Herbert's excellent and frightening article about America's infrastructure was a reminder how such improvements elude federal oversight. Just as Wall Street's shortcomings led us into a recession, the country's infrastructure teeters on similar pillars. 
 Officials need a calamity to occur before the finger-pointing begins. If Wall Street can be restored from its excesses, why can't attention be given to our bridges (and tunnels)? Does America have to hold a lottery to raise funds for such restoration? Without a proactive agenda, each crossing becomes a gamble against time.

HEADLINE: Leaving the Trash Behind

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
The aviation industry is often criticized for contributing to global warming through airplane exhaust. But waste of a different kind also has the potential to create environmental problems. 
 Even before they board, air travelers throw away trash of all sorts -- including paper, plastic and food waste -- and airports and airlines recycle only a small portion of it. 
 An estimated 7.5 million pounds of trash is generated every day. While the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, says that 75 percent of that trash is recyclable, it has found that only 20 percent reaches a recycling center. 
 ''It does not make sense to acquire oil from the Middle East or the north slope of Alaska and turn it into a plastic bottle, use it once and throw it away,'' said Allen Hershkowitz, a scientist at the council. 
 The council's figures are from 2006, but are the most recent. The lack of current data was one concern of the Air Transport Association and the Airports Council International. They persuaded the Transportation Research Board, an adviser to the federal government, last November to determine what prevented airports from embracing recycling since travelers seemed to want it. 
 Recycling procedures vary by airline and airport. Environmental programs involve many entities: airports, municipalities, private waste companies and federal security agencies. As a result, each of the nation's 552 commercial airports has its own way of handling waste.
 ''The issue is very local,'' said Nancy Young, the transport association's vice president of environmental affairs. Continental Airlines has been recycling oil, antifreeze and other aircraft maintenance products for two or three years. Recently it began onboard collection of bottles, aluminum cans and cardboard boxes. Leah Raney, managing director of global environmental affairs for Continental, said it was recycling these items through kitchens it owns at hub airports.
 ''We had so many employees that wanted to recycle,'' Ms. Raney said. ''We heard it from customers and from our employees, and that's why we are determined to set it up.''
 Oakland International Airport in California began separating paper, cardboard and bottles from airport trash in 2003. Since adding food scraps to the list in 2004, it handles 455 tons a year, diverting 37 percent of its waste from landfills, said Rosemary Barnes, the airport spokeswoman. The airport has also cut in half the number of trash pickups each month, helped in small part by the Silver Dragon Cafe, a new restaurant tenant that uses compostable food containers.
 ''I recognize to make a difference, it comes from the top down,'' said Lilly Mar-Chee, the restaurant's owner, who acknowledged it was difficult to decide to spend 10 to 20 percent more for the containers, made from potato starch, while opening a business during the economic downturn. ''We are committed to using resources in a sustainable way.'' 
 Even when recycling is available, airport procedures can sometimes make it hard for travelers to use it properly. At Portland International Airport in Oregon, officials discovered that 48,000 to 78,000 recyclable bottles ended up in the trash annually because they had been discarded at security checkpoints. 
 ''The public does a really good job in general, but when we came to the checkpoints there's all kinds of liquids in the trash,'' said Stan Jones, the environmental compliance manager at the airport. The airport installed liquid dumping stations at the checkpoints, allowing travelers to pour out unused liquids and reuse or recycle the bottles. Mr. Jones said liquid collection was an environmental decision with an economic benefit. With more bottles being recycled, trash containers are lighter and fewer custodians are needed to remove them. 
 ''There's a number of benefits,'' he said. ''People can empty their bottle and take it through security. The other is we're getting liquids out of recycling and out of the garbage.'' 
 While a few airports have contacted Portland about following its lead, many more are establishing or refining recycling programs. At Newark Liberty International Airport, all tenants must recycle basic materials, according to Susan M. Baer, director of aviation for the airport's operator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 ''How you achieve it?'' Ms. Baer asked about getting people to think about the environment. ''By growing generations of people who want to recycle and making it possible for them to do so.'' 
 This month, Green America, an environmental group, started a campaign to get air travelers to pay attention to how trash is handled and to report what they find at the organization's Web site. 
 ''We can pressure them into doing more recycling and ramping up their programs,'' said Victoria Kreha, coordinator of Green America's responsible shopper program, who also wrote a report grading airline recycling efforts. 
 A few passengers take things into their own hands, among them Beth Terry, 44, an accountant from Oakland. When Ms. Terry flies, she brings bamboo eating utensils, a cloth napkin and a glass straw. 
 ''I don't want to waste another plastic cup or another plastic chip bag,'' Ms. Terry said. She blogs about her personal campaign to reduce consumption of plastic at fakeplasticfish.com.

HEADLINE: America's Elite, and the Discontented

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Power Elite,'' by David Brooks (column, Feb. 19), valuably extends David Halberstam's question about talent and credentials: why ''men who were said to be the ablest to serve in government in this century'' led the country into Vietnam. 
 Ditto the men and women who led the country into Iraq, and who are now leading us deeper into Afghanistan. All attended top schools, and many have been described in Washington as ''brilliant.'' 
 But articulateness gets seriously confused with intellect.
 ''Brilliance'' among these best and brightest says nothing about qualities of judgment, teamwork, perspective and the courage to change one's mind -- let alone about prudence and humility. 
 Like David Halberstam, Mr. Brooks is to be thanked for offering more careful depictions of ability.
 Derek Leebaert Washington, Feb. 19, 2010
 The writer, a management consultant, is the author of the forthcoming ''Magic and Mayhem: The Enduring Illusions that Undercut America's Real World Power.''
 To the Editor:
 It is difficult to understand David Brooks's belief that Americans today feel less connected with leaders who have emerged from the crucible of meritocracy.
 America has struggled for centuries with increasing diversity and the resulting shifts of power. And we are better for it. As a daughter of Korean immigrants, I have greater faith in our businesses and government because today there are leaders whose stories reflect my own. 
 No doubt the Condoleezza Rices and Sonia Sotomayors have their failings, just as the WASP male elite is capable of partisan, reckless decision-making. But for meritocratic leaders, influence is based on performance, not birth. They are not incentivized to maintain the status quo.
 This is important because we live in a faster-moving, more heterogeneous world. It is because of meritocracy that America's leaders are better equipped to navigate these complex times. I trust them more than ever before. 
 Gina Kim Shoreview, Minn., Feb. 19, 2010
 To the Editor: 
 Though David Brooks rightly decries the loss of trust in American institutions and describes some reasons for it, he misses the root cause.
 Eras of rapid capital growth, like the Gilded Age that ended in 1929 and the new one that began in 1980, increase economic inequality. What Mr. Brooks calls meritocracy is a new class division, based not on cultural but economic change. 
 Though the new ruling class is multicultural, its members live in settings walled off by home prices and income disparities that perpetuate inequality at the school district level. 
 Like the populists of the last Gilded Age, Tea Partiers today correctly perceive that they have been losing relative prosperity and power for decades. Only dramatic measures to increase social mobility by fostering employment and education, on the scale of the New Deal and the G.I. Bill in their effects, offer hope of reversing this trend.
 Peter Gardella Purchase, N.Y., Feb. 20, 2010
 The writer is a professor of world religions at Manhattanville College.
 To the Editor: 
 David Brooks has put his finger on the alienation of the American public. The meritocracy has morphed into an incestuous, self-congratulatory group with great talents for book learning and test-taking but sadly lacking in ''street smarts'' and common sense. 
 Since many of these were lured to Wall Street and then to Washington, they captured our government, where they were recycled by succeeding administrations. There they systematically demolished the fire walls in our financial system. 
 When any criticism is brought up, one is immediately told how smart he (usually) is. Unfortunately, being smart doesn't necessarily make one right.
 What was President Obama thinking when he appointed Lawrence H. Summers and Timothy F. Geithner, who helped engineer this calamity?
 Mr. Obama's first order of business should have been to address the pocketbook issues of a ravaged public. Instead, he chose to make his mark on history by pursuing a poorly understood health care bill in the face of a frightened public.
 Meanwhile, the public seethes while it watches Wall Street tycoons revel in their greed and the government looks on.
 Katherine Ebert Wellesley Hills, Mass., Feb. 19, 2010
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks astutely bemoans the failure of American government to fulfill the ''promise of the meritocracy,'' correlating the increased talent level and work ethic that characterize many of today's more modern leaders with an actual decrease in their public standing. 
 To the list of proffered causes I would add the principle of conflict of interest, specifically, the appointment of otherwise smart and successful business people or professionals who cruise cozily between industry and government and whose policy recommendations, therefore, may be held hostage to personal agenda or bias -- real or imagined -- and be viewed as contrary to the public good.
 Jonathan H. Zins Westport, Conn., Feb. 19, 2010
 To the Editor:
 While David Brooks has hit upon the symptoms of our moral malaise, he has missed the cause. 
 As a society we have lost our sense of virtue. People are taking obscene amounts of money simply because they can. The sense of obligation to a deeper moral truth has been lost. Why? 
 One reason is that the meritocracy described by Mr. Brooks is inherently individualistic. Our moral sense depends upon a sense of community, and those ties seem to have become lost. I can't help but think that this is a result of the growing secularism of our society. 
 While there is no obvious reason secularism cannot be moral, history seems to show that without religious community, society loses its moral sense. God is gone, and the greedy immorality of our ruling class is a result.
 (Rev.) Mitchell Brown Wilmette, Ill., Feb. 19, 2010
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks accurately notes that the United States is fairer and more open than it was 60 years ago. At the same time, he notes that people are more distrustful of government. He observes that ''the more government has become transparent, the less people are inclined to trust it.''
 Is it possible that the public's increasing distrust of government reflects exquisite observational judgment on its part -- that, truly, the emperor has no clothes?

HEADLINE: Iceland Asks For U.S. Help In Loan Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
The prime minister of Iceland said on Monday that her country was seeking the help of the United States to ensure that Britain and the Netherlands did not use a dispute over aid to depositors of its collapsed banks to hold up international loans. 
 The announcement came as Iceland's government and opposition officials met to discuss revised terms offered by Britain and the Netherlands on a $5.4 billion ''Icesave loan.''
 That loan is to be used to reimburse those governments for repaying domestic depositors who lost their savings when Iceland's three biggest banks, which had expanded aggressively in Northern Europe, collapsed in October 2008. The repayment terms remain the subject of intense debate.
 The two countries are offering Iceland sweeter terms after President Olafur R. Grimsson moved to block a previous agreement in early January, saying the measure should be submitted to a national referendum, in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- polls showing the debt deal would fail if put before voters. The referendum is to take place on March 6.
 Many Icelanders argue that the depositor loan would impose an impossible burden on future generations. 
 The International Monetary Fund agreed in November 2008 to give Iceland $2.2 billion in aid, of which just over $1 billion has been disbursed. 
 The Fund must carry out a second review of Iceland's restructuring plan before it will release $168 million more, and that review is also necessary to unlock $690 million in aid from the Nordic countries and Poland. 
 Urdur Gunnarsdottir, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir told legislators in Parliament that the country had requested a meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to solicit America's help.
 Ms. Gunnarsdottir, the spokeswoman, emphasized that Washington was not being asked to intervene directly in the dispute. ''People here want to ensure that the I.M.F. funds and the Icesave deal are separate,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Rally Pauses Amid Caution About Economy

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Volatility returned to Wall Street on Monday, ending a four-day winning streak for stocks, as worries over the energy sector overshadowed hopes that banks would continue to bring in generous profits. 
 With little on the economic calendar, the attention turned to Washington and the political struggles underpinning the debate over monetary policy.
 Investors spent Monday trying to divine what the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, would say when he testified before a House committee on Wednesday. With unemployment high and many parts of the economy still depending on government support, investors were betting that Mr. Bernanke would reiterate his pledge to keep interest rates near zero in the immediate future. 
 ''It certainly seems like the tone of what he says about the recovery is going to be a lot better,'' said Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase. ''But the private sector is not self-sustaining just yet, and it is too early for the Fed to engage in a broad policy normalization.''
 That consensus was enough to spur a rally for banking stocks, with JPMorgan Chase rising 2 percent, Wells Fargo climbing 2.34 percent and Citigroup gaining 1.17 percent. Low interest rates have translated into extraordinary profits for banks, allowing them to borrow cheaply and lend at higher rates. 
 Adding to the financial sector's gains, shares of Bank of America rose 2 percent after a federal judge approved a $150 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 But the winning day for banks was undermined by a drop in commodity prices, which sent shares of energy companies down. Natural gas prices fell about 2.5 percent, and copper declined 1.6 percent. In response, Chevron tumbled nearly 1.5 percent and Exxon Mobil fell 0.7 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 18.97 points, or 0.18 percent, at 10,383.38. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.16 points, or 0.1 percent, closing at 1,108.01. The Nasdaq fell 1.84 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,242.03.
 Analysts noted that trading was light on Monday, heightening the volatility on Wall Street. They said investors were recalibrating their portfolios before a spate of data later this week on sectors including the housing market and retail sales. 
 ''There's a lot of different views on where the market is headed,'' said Dan A. Faretta, senior market strategist for LaSalle Futures Group. ''Right now the market is kind of taking a breather.''
 Shares of drug makers stumbled after President Obamaannounced details of his $950 billion health care proposal. The plan would reduce the deficit by $100 billion over the next 10 years, but investors remained concerned that it could diminish the profitability of health care companies.
 Shares of the drug maker Merck fell about 1 percent. 
 Last week, the Federal Reserve took its first small step toward tightening policy by raising the rate it charges on short-term loans to banks. 
 Several earnings reports on Monday provided some signs that the recovery was on track. 
 Lowe's, the home improvement chain, said its profit had grown 27 percent in the fourth quarter and that revenue was strong. Shares of the company slipped 0.3 percent, however, as investors were concerned by the company's financial forecast.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 6/32, to 98 19/32. The yield rose to 3.8 percent, from 3.77 percent late Friday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities:

HEADLINE: Bank's Deal With S.E.C. Is Approved

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
In a ruling that freed Bank of America from some legal problems, a federal judge wrote on Monday that he had reluctantly approved a $150 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 But even as the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of the Southern District of New York, approved the settlement, he delivered harsh words for the S.E.C., saying that the agreement was ''half-baked justice at best.''
 The settlement stems from the bank's merger with Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis. In the months before the deal closed, Bank of America did not tell its shareholders about Merrill's hefty bonus payouts or the mounting losses that eventually led to a second government bailout of $20 billion. 
 In a written opinion released Monday, Judge Rakoff declared that the evidence showed that the bank had failed to adequately disclose the bonuses and the losses.
 However, he said it was unclear if the lack of disclosure had resulted from negligence or ill intent. 
 The judge, known for his maverick ways, said the settlement amount was paltry, but he said the deal, the second one the S.E.C. proposed, had met his minimum threshold for approval.
 ''This court, while shaking its head, grants the S.E.C.'s motion and approves the proposed consent judgment,'' the judge wrote. 
 The court order ends a seven-month chapter that began in August when the judge rejected the S.E.C.'s first settlement, which would have forced the bank to pay $33 million in penalties and included only a slim statement of the facts in the case. It was, the judge said in his latest ruling, a ''vacuous proposal.'' The S.E.C. was forced to come up with something more substantial to avoid a March 1 trial date that Judge Rakoff had set.
 ''We are very pleased that the settlement with the S.E.C. has been approved,'' Bank of America said in a statement.
 An S.E.C. spokesman, John Nester, said the agency was also pleased with the ruling. 
 ''The settlement was based on a thorough and objective assessment of the facts and the law,'' Mr. Nester said, ''and sends a strong message that companies must give shareholders all material information about corporate transactions subject to shareholder approval.'' 
 Though Bank of America has continued to argue that its disclosures were proper, the judge made it clear that he disagreed, a view that could add momentum to some of the shareholder lawsuits related to the case.
 ''Despite the bank's somewhat coy refusal to concede the materiality of these nondisclosures, it seems obvious that a prudent bank shareholder,'' the judge wrote, ''would have thought twice about approving the merger or might have sought its renegotiation.''
 The bank still faces a complaint filed last month by Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York. The judge, after studying some of the evidence in Mr. Cuomo's case, left room for that case to reach a different conclusion than the S.E.C.'s. 
 In particular, the judge said the S.E.C. had substantial evidence to support the bank's claim that the dismissal of its general counsel, Timothy J. Mayopoulos, ''was unrelated to the nondisclosures or to his increasing knowledge of Merrill's losses.''
 That is the position the bank and its executives have argued since last spring, but Mr. Cuomo's office asserts that the firing was related to advice from Mr. Mayopoulos.
 Judge Rakoff said he had not determined which was right, but he said he was comfortable that the S.E.C.'s conclusion was reasonable.
 ''It is important to emphasize, with respect not just to the Mayopoulos termination but with respect to all the events that the attorney general interprets so very differently from the S.E.C., that the court is not here making any determination as to which of the two competing versions of the events is the correct one,'' the judge wrote.
 Mr. Cuomo's complaint differs from the S.E.C.'s in that it charges the bank as well as its former chief financial officer, Joe Price, and the chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, who retired early in part because of the mounting investigations into the merger.
 The judge said in his order that he would have preferred that the fine be paid by the executives who were responsible for the lack of disclosures, rather than shareholders. The S.E.C. has worked out a system that will fine mostly the old Merrill shareholders rather than the old Bank of America shareholders, who were harmed. 
 The bank and the S.E.C. agreed last week to a few modest changes that the judge had proposed related to the bank's corporate governance. The final settlement depends on the parties submitting the settlement with those changes. 
 The bank did not agree to the judge's proposal to allow the S.E.C. and the court to play a role in its choice of compensation consultants. In his ruling, Judge Rakoff said that refusal was not enough to persuade him to block the settlement.
 As he put out his final words, Judge Rakoff summed up what he thought of the controversial Merrill deal. It is a ''merger that may yet turn out well,'' he wrote, ''but that could have been a bank-destroying disaster if the U.S. taxpayer had not saved the day.''

HEADLINE: Recession Tightens Grip On State Tax Revenues

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The recession can now claim another troublesome record: state tax collections shrank at the end of 2009 for a fifth consecutive quarter, the longest period of continuing state revenue declines since at least the Great Depression, according to a new report. 
 Over all, state tax collections fell to $134.5 billion in the last quarter of 2009, a 4.1 percent drop from the $140.2 billion collected during the same period a year earlier, according to the report, which will be released Tuesday by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government.
 While the drop in tax collections was less severe than earlier in the year -- the record for the steepest drop was set last spring when tax collections fell by 16.6 percent compared with the same period in 2008 -- the continuing declines are putting even more stress on states.
 The revenue decline comes despite the tax increases imposed by many states since the recession began. With less tax money coming into state treasuries and expenses for programs like Medicaid continuing to mount, many states will probably be forced to consider further tax increases, spending cuts and layoffs -- actions that some economists warn could put a drag on the nation's fragile economic recovery. 
 The Rockefeller Institute report, which was written by Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst, warns, ''State tax revenue will continue to be insufficient to support current spending commitments, and more spending cuts and tax increases are most likely on the way for many states.'' 
 Oklahoma reported the largest revenue drop in the quarter, a 26.9 percent decline compared with the same period the previous year, followed by Arizona, which reported a 17.1 percent drop. Seven states reported growth in revenues, but the report notes that the gains ''were often driven by legislated tax increases rather than growth in the economy and tax base.'' 
 The report predicts that more states will begin seeing revenue growth soon, particularly in sales tax collections as retail sales rebound, but warns that state tax revenue will likely remain below its pre-recession peak ''for quite some time.''
 Many states are hoping that the federal government will provide them with more aid this year, now that much of the state aid included in the stimulus package has been spent. The National Governors Association, which continued its meeting in Washington on Monday, has warned that the fiscal year beginning in July will be ''the most difficult to date.''
 Some states have already tapped so-called rainy day funds, and others have turned to a variety of one-time gimmicks to balance their budgets. Now, many states find themselves in the budgetary equivalent of looking for loose change under the sofa cushions. Some governors are even counting on more federal aid in their proposed budgets for next year, even though it is far from certain that the money will be approved. 
 Others warn that doing so would be imprudent. ''It would be irresponsible,'' Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, a Republican, said in a recent interview. ''It's irresponsible to count money that hasn't even passed Congress.''

HEADLINE: Duane Reade And Its Road To Health

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Good thing Duane Reade is in the pharmacy business.
 Over the years, the chain that seemingly dots every corner of Manhattan has been in dire need of some strong medicine for what some thought was one of the sickest patients in the private equity world.
 Taken private by a small Chicago firm, Oak Hill Partners, in 2004 for $750 million, the deal was described only two years later by BusinessWeek as ''an L.B.O. on the critical list,'' adding that a ''three-year debt binge turned the drug chain from gem to junk.'' 
 Like a homeowner overstretched with a big mortgage on an underwater property, some bondholders whispered back then that the company might have to file for Chapter 11.
 Now, we have the latest chapter in the twists-and-turns story of a New York institution.
 Last week, Duane Reade agreed to be sold to its giant rival Walgreen for a whopping $1.1 billion, including debt -- an earthshaking deal for Manhattan that even topped the local evening newscasts. 
 After all, there are 253 of the stores in the city, and love 'em or hate 'em, everyone's got an opinion (type Duane Reade and Facebook into Google, and the first two results are for an ''I Hate Duane Reade'' Facebook page, higher than Duane Reade's own corporate Facebook page).
 But Duane Reade is as much a story about selling milk and toothpaste at 2 a.m. as it is about Wall Street, financial engineering and shifts in the private equity industry. 
 Duane Reade was born in 1960 when a couple of brothers, the Cohens, started Duane Reade on the corners of -- you guessed it -- Duane and Reade streets. 
 In 1992, after building stores all around the city, the brothers looked to cash out, as many family-run businesses do. 
 The brothers found a willing buyer in Bain Capital of Boston, which leveraged the business and took advantage of the favorable economic winds in 1997 and sold a majority stake to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (the investment bank that was later merged with Credit Suisse). Andrew Nathanson, a banker at D.L.J., then turned around and took Duane Reade public in 1998, just as the dot-com boom was in full swing and lifting everything under the sun, even mundane drugstores. 
 For several years, Duane Reade continued to bumble along, expanding its footprint around New York City with its convenient yet famously cluttered stores.
 By 2004, the economy was just beginning to recover from the bubble's bursting and Mr. Nathanson had left the sinking ship of D.L.J. once it was sold to Credit Suisse. Mr. Nathanson later found himself at Oak Hill, casting for acquisition targets. 
 With debt at historically cheap prices, he went about rebuying Duane Reade, teaming up with the company's chief executive, Anthony Cuti, taking the company private and loading it up with $500 million of debt. 
 With private equity firms buying companies and flipping them within a year or two, Duane Reade looked like a sensible financial-engineering play. 
 All the trend lines showed that as New Yorkers got older, Duane Reade would be in even greater demand. All they had to do was to keep the proverbial shopping cart from hitting the basket of ChapStick at the checkout line.
 And they blew it. By 2006, the business was hemorrhaging money and a series of scathing articles called Duane Reade a ''zombie: dead, but walking among the living,'' as BusinessWeek put it. It didn't help that Mr. Cuti may have inflated the company's income; he has since been indicted on charges of securities fraud. (Mr. Nathanson retired from Oak Hill that same year and died in a surfing accident last summer.)
 But here's where the story takes a surprising, and positive, turn. While private equity firms often talk a good game claiming they are operators, and not financial engineers, Oak Hill proved that it actually could run a company.
 It installed a new management team led by John A. Lederer, the chief executive, that re-imagined the entire experience.
 Been to a Duane Reade in the last couple of months? Some of the refurbished stores are actually a delight to shop in; the sales lines are shorter and the stores refreshed. (Thank you in advance for all the e-mail messages from everyone who disagrees.) Indeed, it was these improvements that caught the eye of Walgreen's management, many of whom had written off Duane Reade altogether. 
 Usually rivals acquire each other to gain market share, but this deal appears to be as much about getting the knowledge that Duane Reade's management has developed to help recreate that experience for Walgreen in other urban areas. 
 That's not to say that Walgreen wasn't looking to gain market share and squeeze savings -- it was -- but it was also about taking advantage of its operational excellence. 
 Walgreen first approached Duane Reade over the summer, but the talks went nowhere because Oak Hill was in the middle of refinancing its debt. But by December, Project Dakota, as it was known around Walgreen, was in full swing with the deal finally announced last week.
 Despite the $1.1 billion price tag for Duane Reade, the deal didn't turn out to be a home run for Oak Hill, which is another theme of the changing landscape of private equity. 
 Oak Hill made 1.5 times its money over six years, or about 11 percent on an annualized basis. On a relative basis to the market, that's not a bad outcome. And considering what people were saying about Duane Reade four years ago, it is a great return. 
 But compared with the returns of yore -- firms making two, three, four times their money -- this deal may actually represent the new normal. Nothing fancy, just the basics. Kind of like Duane Reade itself.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 26, 2010

 CORRECTION:
The DealBook column on Tuesday, about the sale of the Duane Reade drugstore chain, misstated the location of the first store. It was on Broadway between Duane and Reade Streets -- not ''on the corner'' of Duane and Reade, which run parallel. The column also gave an incomplete name for the private equity firm that took the chain private in 2004 and misidentified the location of that firm. It is Oak Hill Capital Partners, not Oak Hill Partners, and it is based in New York, not Chicago.

HEADLINE: 5 Republicans Help Advance Jobs Measure

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Five Republican senators broke ranks with their party on Monday to advance a $15 billion job-creation measure put forward by Democrats, a rare bipartisan breakthrough after months in which Republicans had held together to a remarkable degree in an effort to thwart President Obama's agenda.
 The 62-to-30 vote -- two more yeses than the minimum required to get past a procedural roadblock -- cleared the way for the Senate to vote Wednesday to approve the measure, which Democrats said would create tens of thousands of new jobs at a time when the unemployment rate is hovering near double digits and is expected to remain high for years to come. But it is not clear whether the House, which has backed a broader approach, will go along without making substantial changes. 
 With the midterm elections already revving up and the parties facing deep ideological divides over a host of issues, there was no evidence that Monday's vote was the beginning of a trend. But after being repeatedly stymied by Republicans on a series of initiatives and nominations over the past months, Democrats were elated with the outcome and expressed gratitude to Republicans who sided with them in cutting off a potential filibuster.
 ''Today, jobs triumphed over politics,'' said Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California.
 Senator Scott Brown, the newly elected Republican from Massachusetts, was the first member of his party to cast his vote for the measure. He was followed by Senators Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, George V. Voinovich of Ohio and Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, who voted after it became evident that Democrats would prevail. Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska was the sole Democrat to vote no. 
 Mr. Brown, breaking with his party's leadership on one of his first high-profile votes, said he backed the measure grudgingly, since even its sponsors acknowledged its limited scope.
 ''It is the first step in creating jobs, not only for the people of Massachusetts but for the people of the country,'' said Mr. Brown, who said he intended to pursue other proposals, like an across-the-board cut in payroll taxes.
 The bill was drafted by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and is built around an approach that has won bipartisan support in the past: a $13 billion plan to give companies who hire unemployed Americans an exemption from paying payroll taxes on those workers through the end of this year. It also provides a $1,000 tax credit to employers who keep new workers on the payroll for at least for 52 weeks. 
 Mr. Obama, who will be meeting with Republicans later this week on health care, praised the Senate action. Facing an erosion of support for Mr. Obama among independent voters who say they are not seeing the change that the president promised to bring to Washington, the White House has been looking for opportunities to show that the president can help transcend partisanship.
 ''The American people want to see Washington put aside partisan differences and make progress on jobs, and today the Senate took one important step forward in doing that,'' he said.
 Republicans complained about the way the bill was handled and that they would be prohibited from offering amendments.
 ''Millions of Americans want to get back to work,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. ''That's why Republicans will offer ideas that will make it easier for businesses to hire new workers. Those ideas should be considered, too.'' 
 The outcome of the vote was in doubt throughout the day, and Democrats were prepared to accuse Republicans of simply trying to block any Democratic initiative, since many Republicans had backed the job provisions as part of a larger $85 billion measure that also included billions of dollars in corporate tax breaks.
 ''Enough with the political games,'' Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said before the vote.
 Democrats said they planned to call repeated votes on jobs legislation to force Republicans to explain to the public why they were balking at the measure when they supported the underlying provisions. But the decision by the five Republicans to help bring the bill to the floor short-circuited that argument, though Democratic political operatives immediately aimed criticism at Senate Republicans who supported the failed filibuster.
 Like Mr. Brown, Ms. Snowe said she did not think the measure went far enough, and she also protested the Democratic decision to bar any Republican amendments. But the senator, who was particularly supportive of some business-oriented provisions in the measure, said those concerns were outweighed by the need to show Americans that Congress was acting.
 ''We have to demonstrate outside the Beltway and to Americans that we need to move forward initiatives that are going to benefit small businesses and individuals in a tough economy,'' Ms. Snowe said.
 The vote prevented Mr. Reid from being second-guessed about his handling of the legislation. In a move that angered Republicans, the majority leader earlier this month jettisoned the broader $85 billion measure, which had attracted bipartisan support. 
 He said he instead wanted to focus on core elements of the jobs package in an effort to move it more quickly and then follow up with other provisions on tax benefits and added jobless pay and health care coverage for the unemployed. But his maneuver raised the possibility that the effort could collapse; instead, Mr. Reid pulled out a victory.
 ''I hope this is a beginning of a new day here in the Senate,'' Mr. Reid said after the vote.
 He also promised to return with other jobs-related bills after the Senate disposed of the initial measure.
 Besides the payroll tax exemption, the bill would also extend a tax break, included in last year's stimulus package, to encourage business to make capital expenditures. The provision would allow businesses to write off up to $250,000 in capital investments in 2010 rather than depreciating the costs over time. It is projected to cost the government $35 million over 10 years. 
 The Democrats' measure would also reauthorize the highway trust fund, providing an extension of spending on road and transit programs through the end of the year, allowing billions of dollars in projects to move ahead. Democrats say public works construction is a quick and effective way to lift employment.
 The bill would also allow state and local governments to issue Build America Bonds that provide a direct payment from the federal government for a part of the interest paid on bonds that finance government works projects.

HEADLINE: Into The Mire

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Barack Obama came to Washington with the nation's hope for change riding on his shoulders. He promised to reform the health care system. He hired many of the country's top experts who had written brilliantly about how to do reform.
 He immediately moved away from some of their ideas. This was understandable. America isn't Plato's Republic. It's not a nation governed by experts. It's a democracy. To get things passed, you've got to allow for political reality. 
 So President Obama promised to keep health insurance the same for most Americans. This meant it was going to be harder to bring down costs. This meant it wouldn't be possible to replace the fraying employer-based insurance system. But these compromises could be justified.
 Then the Congress began its deal-making. There were special favors put in for certain senators. There were special arrangements made for big Democratic donors, like the trial lawyers. These were compromises, too. They were ugly, and they soiled everybody involved. But, again, they could be justified for reasons of political expediency. The bill that emerged from the Senate was not to everybody's liking. It wouldn't reduce the nation's overall health care spending.
 But at least the Senate bill had some integrity. It would cover 30 million people without adding to the deficit. It did this in real ways. It included real Medicare cuts. Most importantly, it included an excise tax on luxury insurance plans.
 The excise tax is one of those ideas health care economists of all stripes love. Currently, we have a perverse tax system that taxes salaries but not health benefits. This exclusion favors the rich over the middle class. It encourages extravagant health spending.
 According to the Congressional Budget Office, taxing health benefits is one of the two most effective ways to bring down health care costs. Plus, it brings in a ton of revenue. According to the Lewin Group, a health care consulting firm, the excise tax in the Senate bill would bring in $957 billion between 2020 and 2029. This is what pays for expanding coverage. This is why the president could promise to veto any bill that adds a dime to the deficit.
 But, alas, this is Washington, 2010. The muck rises. The compromises never stop.
 As the year went on, health care reform grew more unpopular. If you average the last 10 polls, 38 percent of voters support the reform plans and 53 percent oppose. Obama's reform is more unpopular than Bill Clinton's was as it died.
 As the political costs rose, members of Congress squealed louder. Congress is not a bastion of courage in the best of circumstances. When it is asked to actually pay for its expenditures, it verges on hysteria.
 Some Republicans campaigned against the excise tax. John McCain had made the excise tax a centerpiece of his reform plan. But Scott Brown of Massachusetts and others ran against it.
 Unions went next. They demanded a special deal so their members would be exempt from the tax. The Democrats caved and gave it to them.
 Blood was now in the water. Everyone smelled weakness. If the White House hopes to pass something in this atmosphere, it needs every Democratic vote it can get. It needs to cater to every special-interest plea. Right now, the White House has no leverage.
 Efforts to kill the tax mounted. On Jan. 27, Nancy Pelosi told a group of journalists, ''The excise tax has no support, very little support, in our caucus.'' The pollsters said it was a loser. That was a sign the Congressional leadership wanted it dead.
 On Monday, the White House made another compromise. On the surface, it seems mundane. The imposition of the excise tax will be delayed until 2018, and the threshold at which the tax kicks in will be raised. In reality, the delay turns the tax into another Washington gimmick. Lord, give me virtue, but not yet.
 The odds are high that the excise tax will never actually happen. There is no reason to think that the Congress of 2018 will be any braver than the Congress of today. It will probably get around the pay-go rules or whatever else might apply and it'll postpone the tax again. The excise tax will turn into another ''doc fix.'' This is a mythical provision in which doctors are always about to get their reimbursements cut. But somehow they never do because the cuts are always pushed back, year after year.
 So we've sunk another level in our tawdry tale. The White House, to its enormous credit, has tried to think about the long term. But it has been dragged ever lower into the mire by Congressional special interests that are parochial in the extreme.
 This bill may be deficit-neutral on paper. But it has just become a fiscal time bomb. The revenue will never come. Compromises have to be made to keep it (barely) alive. But responsibility ebbs. Politics wins.

HEADLINE: Dysfunction Function: Charting the Ideal and Real Legislative Process

BYLINE: DINAH MACK and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Comparing the basic legislative process with the real process, complete with the political machinations at work when a bill works its way through Congress. 

 BODY:
Overview | How does the way Congress was designed to function differ from how it actually operates? How do bills really become laws? What factors contribute to Congressional gridlock? In this lesson, students chart the basic process of how a bill becomes a law, and then consider Senator Evan Bayh's criticisms of the Senate. They then dig into a current piece of legislation and create a detailed flow chart showing the complexity of the real process. Finally, they create "political trees" for members of Congress, showing key relationships, connections and interests. 
Materials | Computers with Internet connection, projector, poster board or oversize paper sheets, markers and research materials
Warm-Up | Show "I'm Just a Bill" from the "Schoolhouse Rock" series and/or hand out copies of the lyrics (you might even lead a sing-a-long). 
Then hang a piece of poster board or large sheet of paper on the board (or use a SmartBoard) and tell students to draw on "I'm Just a Bill" and their previous learning so that the class can work together to create a flow chart of how a bill becomes a law. This flow chart should show the basic process in which bills are developed, written, voted upon and enacted. Invite students to call out ideas and act as the scribe to create the flow chart.
Here is an example of what the completed flow chart might look like (note that you can click on each step to reveal an explanation). You may even wish to briefly compare the completed class chart with this one. 
When the basic flow chart is complete, ask students: Do all bills follow these steps exactly to be considered, voted on and, potentially, enacted? What other factors are at play in the legislative process? Have you heard anyone say that Congress is "broken" or "dysfunctional" or suffering from "gridlock"? What do you think that means? What recent legislation have you heard about? Have news reports about the status of that legislation reflected the basic lawmaking process?
Related | In the Op-Ed article "Why I'm Leaving the Senate," Senator Evan Bayh explains his recent announcement that he would not seek re-election after 12 years of serving as a United States senator from Indiana. In the piece, Mr. Bayh characterizes the Senate as dysfunctional: 
Challenges of historic import threaten America's future. Action on the deficit, economy, energy, health care and much more is imperative, yet our legislative institutions fail to act. Congress must be reformed.
There are many causes for the dysfunction: strident partisanship, unyielding ideology, a corrosive system of campaign financing, gerrymandering of House districts, endless filibusters, holds on executive appointees in the Senate, dwindling social interaction between senators of opposing parties and a caucus system that promotes party unity at the expense of bipartisan consensus.
Read the entire Op-Ed article with your students, using the question below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
What are some of the challenges that Mr. Bayh believes "threaten America's future"?
        
According to Mr. Bayh, what are some of the "many causes for the dysfunction"?
        
In Mr. Bayh's opinion, how does the Senate now differ from the Senate during time his father, Birch Bayh, served, from 1963 to 1981?
        
What changes does Mr. Bayh suggest would make the filibuster a more effective tool to create consensus?
        
What does Mr. Bayh state is required from both Congress and the public to keep the country from peril?
You may also wish to show students the video "Senator Evan Bayh Won't Seek Re-election," in which Mr. Bayh elaborates on his feelings and thoughts about what's wrong with the Senate.
Activity | Explain to students that they will choose a specific bill - currently under consideration or recently enacted - to research, and then make another flow chart, this time with more detail and attention to the various twists and turns in the legislative process, including, as far as possible, "backroom" politics and negotiations.
You might have pairs or small groups each do their own research and flow chart on the same legislation. Or you might assign each group a portion or aspect to research (perhaps taken from Mr. Bayh's list of "dysfunctions"), and then create one classwide flow chart.
For example, to track the recent jobs bill that advanced through the Senate, students read the article "In Passage of Jobs Measure, a Glimpse of Bipartisanship," along with the Caucus blog posts on its proposal and how it progressed, and the editorial "How Not to Write a Jobs Bill."
Additionally, they read the actual bipartisan bill or a summary of the bill, and read other reports and analyses, like Politico's coverage. Students can also watch C-Span clips showing parts of Senate sessions and other coverage of the jobs bill. 
For a slightly more complex task, students might track the route of health care reform legislation, perhaps starting here, including the Feb. 25, 2010, health care summit and its aftermath. Other resources for charting the health care bills include the interactive feature Comparing the House and the Senate Health Care Proposals, Times Topics: Health Care Reform, the Prescriptions blog and the "living story" The Struggle Over Health Care. 
In addition to the links provided in Related Resources above, other helpful resources for students include: 

        
Project Vote Smart provides voting records, issue positions and other information on lawmakers and lawmaking, along with a glossary of terms.
        
The United States Senate Web site's section on legislation and records, which provides the full text and summaries of bills.
        
The United States House of Representatives Web site, which provides current House proceedings, information on the legislative process and a full list of committees.
        
The C-Span Congressional Chronicle archives show Congress deliberating on bills.
Tell students to be sure to include in their flow charts not just official acts, like subcommittee meetings and votes, but also public statements made by political party leaders and members of Congress, as well as expert analysis, to get at the political issues like partisanship that are at play in the process.
When the flow charts are completed, display and discuss them and what they reveal about the political forces that affect the lawmaking system. Ask: Is it easy to pass a bill through Congress? Do the political parties need to work together to ensure that progress is made? What safeguards are put in place to make sure that bills are discussed and challenged before they are passed? Should reforms be made in Congress to make it easier to create change? If so, what reforms would you support, and why?
Going Further | Individually, students choose one member of Congress to research, and then create a "politics tree" for their senator or representative, showing his or her background, political relationships, affiliations, major campaign donors, "pet" issues and relevant lobbies, seniority and so on. They might read The Times Magazine article "Where Scott Brown Is Coming From" as inspiration. 
Students tracking the health care debate read the article "Up Next! On Live TV! A Battle Over Health Care?" and then watch the live broadcast of the discussion on Feb. 25, 2010. While they watch, students should record their impressions on language, tone and bipartisan cooperation.

HEADLINE: Wall Street '09 Bonuses Increase 17% To $20 Billion

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
It's about as official as it gets: the big money is back on Wall Street. 
 Flush with record profits in 2009, investment banks and securities firms paid employees in New York City an estimated $20.3 billion in annual bonuses, according to a report released Tuesday by the New York State Comptroller. That was up from $17.4 billion for 2008. The tally, which is based largely on personal income tax receipts, provides a signpost for what has been one of the most controversial bonus seasons in Wall Street history. For New York, the rapid return of big paydays at banks -- a development that has prompted an outcry from many ordinary Americans -- is something of an embarrassment of riches, since bigger bonuses mean more money for the public coffers. 
 The comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, acknowledged the divide between the financial industry and other professions, but said that the financial industry's new prosperity would ultimately trickle down to the rest of the New York economy. His office estimated that the industry could exceed $55 billion in profits last year. 
 ''The key thing now is, do we all benefit?'' Mr. DiNapoli said at a news conference.
 The 2009 bonus payouts trailed the record $25.6 billion awarded in 2005, when the housing bubble was inflating and the stock market was flying high. But Mr. DiNapoli and pay experts said the total value of 2009 bonuses was far larger than Mr. DiNapoli's estimate, since many banks paid bonuses in the form of deferred stock, which was not immediately taxable, rather than cash.
 While the comptroller's office estimates that bonuses were up 17 percent from 2008, Alan Johnson, a Wall Street compensation consultant, said the payouts were in reality about 30 percent higher.
 ''For the city of New York and the state, this is good news,'' Mr. Johnson said.
 After the billions in taxpayer bailouts, the numbers highlight the divide between Wall Street -- where the recovery has been stronger than Mr. DiNapoli's office had expected a year ago -- and the rest of America, where growth is slow and unemployment remains high.
 But even as pay recovers, the switch to stock awards from cash is hitting the amount of taxes flowing to the state because bankers do not have to pay taxes on their deferred awards immediately, although some choose to do so. Mr. DiNapoli said the dent in tax revenues was worth it if the result was better behavior on Wall Street and an avoidance of the unsustainable ''highs and lows all of us went through.''
 Even so, the comptroller's report said, the rise in bonuses added an extra $600 million to the state's coffers over a year ago, and an extra $75 million to the city's.
 As to the question of when the rest of the economy would benefit, he said that previous studies found that for every job created in the securities industry, three jobs were created elsewhere in the state's economy. 
 Employment on Wall Street fell by 31,500 jobs between November 2007 and August last year. But since then, the industry had begun to recover, if only weakly, creating 3,900 new jobs through December, the comptroller said. 
 The report issued Tuesday found that compensation at the biggest brokers rose faster than at smaller institutions. Compensation at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and the investment banking operations of JPMorgan Chase rose 31 percent last year. 
 The average taxable bonus across the industry rose to $123,850.

HEADLINE: Despite a Price Gain in December, Signs of Worry on Housing

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The wobbly state of the housing market was made clear on Tuesday with the release of data showing that home prices managed a modest increase in December even as many more Americans owed more on their properties than they were worth.
 The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0.3 percent in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, with most of the cities improving from November. 
 It was the seventh consecutive month that the index showed rising prices, a welcome respite after several years of wrenching declines. But another 600,000 households slipped underwater during the fourth quarter, with their homes valued at less than their mortgages, according to the data firm First American CoreLogic, a real estate research company. 
 The total number of households with negative equity is now 11.3 million, or 24 percent of all residential properties with mortgages, up from 23 percent in the third quarter, First American said.
 Negative equity is a major concern among policy makers because it can compel disillusioned borrowers to forsake their properties, contributing to the foreclosure problem. The breaking point for homeowners, research shows, is when negative equity reaches about 25 percent. 
 Five million people are now at or beyond that point, First American estimates, up from 4.5 million in the third quarter.
 The research firm recalibrated its data in the third quarter, which means earlier negative equity numbers are not comparable. But it said that the number of severely underwater borrowers was growing even faster than it expected a few weeks ago.
 ''Home prices in the worst areas -- Florida, Nevada and Arizona -- fell more than we had expected, increasing the amount of negative equity,'' a First American senior economist, Sam Khater, said.
 First American's home price index, released last week, fell for both December and the fourth quarter. That contrasted with the improving Case-Shiller numbers. 
 The two firms measure different groups of homeowners using different methodologies. The disparate results indicate how difficult it is at the moment to get a fix on the housing market. 
 There is a widespread feeling among analysts that the market is being kept afloat by the government's emergency measures, especially the tax credit for buyers. The market's true level will become apparent only after the tax credit ends in the spring -- assuming it is not renewed as it was in the fall.
 Prices in the West Coast cities tracked by Case-Shiller, including Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Diego, increased the most in December. Laggards were Chicago, New York and Tampa, Fla.
 ''The recovery has slowed since the summer months, but it has not completely fallen apart,'' Maureen Maitland, S.& P.'s vice president for index services, said. ''We're in a bit of a flat period.''
 Las Vegas, the worst hit of all the major housing markets, managed its second consecutive monthly gain. ''Vegas was so battered there is now a tiny bit of hope,'' Ms. Maitland said. ''You can only fall so much.''
 In the case of Las Vegas, that was apparently a drop of 57 percent from its peak. Seven of 10 homeowners with mortgages in Nevada owe more on their properties than they are worth, according to the First American data. In Arizona and Florida, about half the owners are underwater. 
 Further price declines could give many of these owners the impetus to walk away. If interest rates rise and the tax credit is not renewed, another slump is expected. Nationally, prices are already about where they were in summer 2003. Further declines could add up to a lost decade for housing prices.
 Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., said he expected the market to drop after the tax credit expired. At that point, he said, ''more of the true fundamentals will come through on pricing.'' 
 In the spring, the seasonal adjustment factors will tend to weigh on Case-Shiller prices, rather than bolster them as they do now. Without the adjustments, most of the cities in the index fell in December. The composite dropped 0.2 percent for the second consecutive month.
 On an annual basis, the 20-city index was down 3.1 percent. That figure has improved consistently for a year. Only three cities -- Detroit, Tampa and Las Vegas -- are still showing double-digit annual declines.
 The quarterly return for the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index of national home prices, which incorporates data from a broader slice of the country, was also released on Tuesday. That index fell 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2008.

 BODY:
F.D.I.C. Mission:
 Slay the Zombies
 Killing zombies isn't just a job for horror movie heroines. It's also the primary task of Sheila C. Bair, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 Ms. Bair's challenge has increased as the number of so-called problem banks on the F.D.I.C.'s watch list has spiked. But there is little reason the F.D.I.C. can't exterminate the banking industry's living dead. 
 On Tuesday, the agency reported that 702 problem institutions were on its watch list as of the end of 2009. Those institutions had combined assets of $403 billion, or the equivalent of 3 percent of the nation's economic output. While those figures may seem scary, the F.D.I.C. also managed to collect $46 billion in new cash from banks, bringing its total cash and liquid securities to $66 billion. 
 That may not seem to be much of a cushion. After all, the average estimated loss rate for bank failures since 2007 -- excluding the collapse of the giant Washington Mutual -- is 23 percent of assets. 
 Assuming no truly gigantic banks founder -- that is, the ones considered ''too big to fail'' -- the F.D.I.C.'s kitty is currently around $27 billion shy of being able absorb all its sick banks.
 Not all of the banks on the F.D.I.C.'s list will be seized. Many banks work their way through difficulties, raise private capital or are taken over by healthier rivals. And the F.D.I.C. can levy another special assessment on banks before asking the taxpayer to pitch in. Add it all up, and the F.D.I.C. has no financial excuse to avoid cleaning up the mess. 
 Yet the pace of bank seizures -- up by half so far this year -- hasn't kept pace with the growth of the problem bank list. The worry is that zombie banks will suck up deposits and hoard capital that might otherwise be lent out by healthy institutions. 
 The winter storms that closed down Washington this month complicated travel plans for F.D.I.C. staff members. But the main lesson from the savings-and-loan debacle of the 1980s and 1990s was that delays in closing insolvent banks increase resolution costs for the F.D.I.C. and, ultimately, taxpayers. 
 With spring around the corner, Ms. Bair needs to set her sights on a big zombie hunting trip. 
 Japan's Recovery
 The conventional wisdom is that Japan has never really recovered from the bursting of the stock market and real estate bubbles in 1990. That view is basically wrong.
 Sure, prices have not recovered. The stock market is still almost 75 percent below its peak, and land prices are down 60 percent. After two decades of nearly stable consumer prices, the Japanese government is once again badgering the central bank to do something to create a bit of inflation.
 This appeal, like so many before it, is likely to end inconclusively. Japan will continue with its longstanding pattern of near-stable prices, slow growth and gargantuan government deficits. But the economy is basically in pretty good shape.
 While the economic growth -- about 1 percent a year since 1990 -- seems unimpressive, the number of people below retirement age has been shrinking by 0.4 percent a year. Annual growth in per capita gross domestic product in the United States over the same period was 1.4 percent -- not much different from Japan's.
 Other economic indicators suggest Japan is managing pretty well. Even midrecession, car sales are only 20 percent less than at the 1990 peak. 
 Housing starts are down 50 percent, but the population was rising then and is declining now. The 5 percent unemployment rate is modest by Western standards. And the 1.4 percent yield on the 10-year government bond hardly seems a vote of no confidence in the government or the country.
 The country's financial burden -- gross government debt at 200 percent of G.D.P. -- could yet prove too much to bear for a rapidly aging and steadily declining Japanese population. But for now, Japan should be more a sign of hope than gloom for the United States, Britain and euro zone countries that have endured a severe financial collapse.
 Japan had advantages in dealing with its financial collapse. It has a high savings rate, a big trade surplus and a powerful tradition of cultural and political unity. Few Western countries have all of these. Most also face almost Japanese-style demographic challenges. They will be fortunate to do as well as Japan.

HEADLINE: As Deadline Nears, G.M.'s Sale of Hummer Faces Several Big Obstacles

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Hostility from Chinese regulators and financing problems are increasingly likely to scuttle plans by an obscure Chinese machinery company to buy the Hummer division from General Motors, people close to the negotiations said on Tuesday. 
 General Motors has already extended repeatedly its deadline for completing the deal, with the current deadline at the end of this week; the original deadline was last September. But the buyer, the Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company, has failed to win regulatory approval for the deal at a time when senior Chinese officials are trying to put a new emphasis on limiting China's dependence on imported oil and protecting the environment.
 Chinese banks are now pulling back from offers to lend money to Tengzhong for the deal and Western banks are leery of becoming involved, people close to the transaction said. Auto industry analysts are deeply skeptical the deal will be completed.
 ''The deal is on the ropes, if it's not on the canvas yet,'' said Michael Dunne, the president of Dunne & Company, a Hong Kong auto consulting firm.
 Tengzhong is still trying to complete the transaction by setting up a subsidiary outside China to buy Hummer, according to Chinese media reports on Tuesday that were confirmed by people close to the deal. These people asked for anonymity because of the political and financial sensitivity of the deal.
 ''As long as they are talking, they are going to try to make a deal,'' said one of these people.
 General Motors and Tengzhong declined to comment. 
 Tengzhong had been prepared to pay $150 million to $200 million for Hummer, and would not assume debts as part of the planned transaction.
 Providing new details on the proposed deal, people close to the negotiations said that the biggest obstacle to emerge in the last few days was not regulatory approval, as suggested by the Chinese media, but rather bank financing.
 Regulators have informally agreed not to object if Tengzhong makes the purchase through an offshore subsidiary, said another person knowledgeable about the transaction. But if an offshore subsidiary is used, Hummer would not qualify as a Chinese company after the deal and would not be able to open a low-cost assembly plant in China any time soon to supplement production in the United States.
 China only allows foreign automakers to set up 50-50 joint ventures with Chinese car companies, and each of these deals also requires individual approval from regulators.
 While Tengzhong has the cash to pay for the Hummer brand, it needs bank financing to operate the division, redesign vehicles and set up new production facilities in China. Some of China's biggest banks had agreed to provide that financing, but have now pulled out partly because they prefer to lend to projects with Beijing's blessing and partly because of concerns about whether Hummer can be run profitably without a factory in China, one of the people close to the transaction said.
 Tengzhong has been desperately trying to persuade Western banks in the last few days to lend it the money to operate Hummer while keeping it outside China, but has found little enthusiasm so far, this person added. 
 Hummer sales have plunged in the last two years because of the combination of high gas prices and the slump in the global economy.
 G.M. had planned to keep making the Hummer H3 and H3T for Tengzhong through 2012 in Shreveport, La.

HEADLINE: At Home, Toyota's Woes Include Mounting Anger Among Former Friends

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Toyota City.

DATELINE: KARIYA, Japan 

 BODY:
As Toyota's president Akio Toyoda faces American lawmakers on Wednesday, his company will be facing something else here in Japan's auto manufacturing heartland: an unprecedented level of opprobrium. 
 Come what may, Toyota used to be able to count on a reflexive loyalty in this small city, where the rows of smoke stacks and metal-roofed factories rise like something out of Dickens. But after years of feeling the sting of Toyota's cost-cutting, some of the workers and suppliers that used to be the company's biggest cheerleaders are instead experiencing a sense of grim pleasure over the company's woes.
 The change is rooted in the changing behavior of Japanese corporations. Communities like Kariya that once enjoyed a near familial relationship with Toyota, have been feeling forsaken for years as this country's social contract has changed. 
 While employment is still for life for Toyota's full-time workers, some complain that the company is now miserly with wage increases. Over time it has steadily reduced the ranks of its short-term contractors and pressured its suppliers to decrease prices. 
 For decades, thousands of tiny auto parts companies like Sankyo Seiko were Toyota's loyal legions, and toiled in relative obscurity to supply the behemoth. But the auto giant's demands in recent years for ever lower prices have driven many of these companies out of business. 
 After successive price cuts, Toyota now pays them about 30 percent less for the same part than it did a decade ago, despite the higher cost of raw materials like steel, many companies say.
 ''Toyota just squeezes us, like it's trying to wring water from a dry towel,'' said Masayuki Nishioka, 49, whose factory in Kariya makes the rubber seals for Toyota's car windows.
 Last month something snapped for Sankyo's owner, Teruo Moewaki. He appeared on local television to do the unthinkable: criticize Toyota, announcing that he would no longer accept orders from the automaker or its affiliates. 
 ''I said on TV what they all want to say, but are afraid to,'' said Mr. Moewaki, 60, standing in the dark one-room workshop where he and his three employees operate gritty machines. ''Toyota said we were all one big family. But now they are betraying us.''
 The outburst turned Mr. Moewaki into an instant local celebrity. But he is not the only one speaking out. 
 To hear many here tell it, in good times Toyota failed to increase wages for employees and forced painful price cuts on parts suppliers even as it earned record profits. Since the global downturn, these critics say, Toyota has released thousands of contract workers and squeezed parts makers even further.
 While this may seem like normal, even prudent, management, many in Japan see it as an act of betrayal. In fact, Toyota has become a symbol here of how corporate Japan has begun to violate the nation's unspoken postwar social contract, in which big paternalistic companies share the wealth with employees and business partners in good times and help them weather the bad. 
 ''Toyota is attacked so much because it has become the face of corporate Japan,'' said Hisao Inoue, the author of two books on Toyota. ''All Japan's social problems, economic problems, political problems all seem to pile up on Toyota.''
 Mr. Inoue said the criticism can be unfair, and is part of a broader reaction here against globalization and the embrace of American-style competition under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Still, some dozen books have been published in the last five years, with titles like ''The Dark Side of Toyota'' and ''The Toyota You Don't Know.'' 
 Even through the early 1990s economic collapse, as big companies squeezed costs or shifted production overseas to compete with lower-price rivals from South Korea and China, this manufacturing belt around the central city of Nagoya, an area known as the Detroit of Japan, seemed immune. Toyota continued to grow even as Japan stumbled in other industries, like consumer electronics. 
 Now there is a palpable sense of alarm in the air. Cities like Kariya appear to be turning into a new rust belt of abandoned industrial neighborhoods, with economists estimating the number of small manufacturers in this part of Japan has dropped by half in the last two decades to about 180,000. Unemployment has also taken off in Aichi prefecture, where Nagoya is located, doubling to 4.5 percent last year from the year before.
 One of the newly jobless is Osamu Miura, who worked for two years monitoring quality control at a sprawling plant making Prius hybrids in nearby Toyota City, where the automaker is based. Two months ago, the company said it would not renew his contract, making him one of thousands in that category after the global financial crisis began.
 But unlike most of the others, Mr. Miura has refused to go quietly. Every day, he has donned his immaculate company uniform and Toyota cap to report for work at the factory gate, where he is invariably turned away. On a recent rainy afternoon, a half-dozen current and former Toyota employees, members of a small labor union, joined him in front of the gate to hand out fliers to passing workers. 
 ''Toyota is going in the wrong direction, and so is Japan,'' said Mr. Miura, 40, who taped a blue placard to his chest that said, ''Let me work!''
 ''Standing up against Toyota is still a taboo,'' said Hiroshi Oba, 56, a Toyota employee at the Prius plant who said he was putting his chances for promotion at risk by standing with Mr. Miura, ''but these job cuts are a social problem that we cannot ignore.''
 Paul Nolasco, a spokesman for Toyota, said the company was aware of such criticisms, but called them one-sided. He said that while the number of contract workers had fallen to 2,300 early this year, from 10,000 before the Lehman Brothers crisis in September 2008, some 900 contract workers have been given full-time jobs since 2008.
 It is also hard to gauge the full extent of anger at Toyota. Japan's establishment media have been restrained in their criticism even during the recalls for fear of angering the company, the nation's largest advertiser. Toyota critics here say the community still frowns on criticism of the region's largest employer, making many afraid to speak out.
 But that is changing, too. Saichi Kurematsu, chairman of the Airoren, a federation of labor unions in Aichi prefecture, said that complaints once limited to the far left are entering the mainstream. He said attendance at his federation's rallies against Toyota has jumped sevenfold since 2003, the local media now write about his activities and even small company owners, once antiunion, welcome his criticisms of Toyota.
 ''There has been a dramatic change in how people view Toyota,'' Mr. Kurematsu said. 
 Mr. Moewaki, the factory owner who spoke out on TV, said small companies are moving out of the auto industry to survive. 
 ''Toyota just fills its own pockets now,'' Mr. Moewaki said. ''It is already clear that we cannot rely on Toyota anymore.''

HEADLINE: The Washington Area Primps as Northrop Grumman Shops for a New Home

BYLINE: By EUGENE L. MEYER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The announcement last month that Northrop Grumman would move its headquarters to the Washington area after 72 years in Los Angeles has set off a feverish competition among local governments to land the company, one of the nation's largest military contractors. 
 The move will involve just 300 employees in a worldwide work force of 120,000. But apart from generating immediate benefits like business- and income-tax revenue, Northrop Grumman's new headquarters is likely to draw subcontractors who want to be near the main office of a company that had $33.8 billion in sales last year, mostly from government awards. 
 The first group of 150 employees is scheduled to arrive by the summer of 2011, Northrop Grumman said. With the real estate consulting firm CB Richard Ellis, the company has focused on five locations in Virginia, three in Maryland and two in the District of Columbia that would provide 150,000 to 200,000 square feet, according to several people involved in the site search who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. It intends to make a final selection as early as next month.
 ''It's incredibly good news for the greater Washington region,'' said Matthew Erskine, executive director of the Greater Washington Initiative, a marketing arm of the Greater Washington Board of Trade. ''A corporation as significant as Northrop Grumman doesn't take this kind of decision lightly.''
 The company is already a major presence in the region, with about 40,000 employees in Virginia (half at its Newport News shipbuilding facility), 20,000 in Maryland and 100 in the District of Columbia. 
 In announcing the shift, the company said it was moving its headquarters to be close to its ''large customer base in the Washington, D.C., region,'' referring to the military and intelligence agencies located there.
 The District of Columbia first got wind that a large corporation was considering relocation sites in the area late last year, said Valerie Santos, deputy mayor for economic development. 
 ''We got a call,'' Ms. Santos said. ''They wouldn't tell us who they were calling for. They wanted to know if D.C. had an attraction-retention program.'' Then came last month's announcement from the company, along with its statement that financial incentives and geographical access to federal power centers would be the deciding factors in its site decision. 
 Company officials visited the state capitals of Richmond, Va., and Annapolis, Md., this month to discuss those states' respective bids.
 ''Competition only works if everyone knows there is a competition,'' said Gaston Kent, vice president for finance at Northrop. ''Our process is open and transparent because that's the way we do business.'' 
 State officials in Maryland and Virginia have not discussed the substance of their offers. The District of Columbia, on the other hand, has put its bid out for public view, in the form of legislation now before the City Council, where it has seven sponsors and the support of Mayor Adrian M. Fenty. The city's package includes up to $19 million in property tax abatements and $5.5 million to help defray relocation costs. 
 ''D.C. is prepared to meet and exceed any financial benefits put forth by Maryland or Virginia,'' said Councilman Jack Evans, the lead sponsor of the bill. 
 The incentive package is similar in form to what the district successfully offered to the CoStar Group, a commercial real estate information company, to lure it from Bethesda, Md., this year. 
 For the most part, officials have been running a publicly positive campaign. ''You want people to come to you because you're the best,'' said the president of the Maryland State Senate, Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., who gave Northrop officials a tour of the historic State House in Annapolis, ''not because you trump a sister state or fellow jurisdiction. You like to compete on a friendly basis.'' 
 But regional rivalries have surfaced.
 ''Would you rather be in downtown Washington or Crystal City?'' in Virginia, Mr. Evans said. ''Bethesda is just a hike. The bottom line is they want to be close to the Pentagon, Capitol and White House. It's almost like a no-brainer.''
 Mr. Miller said Northrop Grumman officials were impressed with Maryland's AAA bond rating, among other factors. He said the company was looking at National Harbor and College Park, both in Prince George's County, and locations in adjoining Montgomery County. 
 Montgomery County is home to the military contractor Lockheed Martin, which is larger than Northrop Grumman in total employees and sales. But Maryland's corporate tax rate, 8.25 percent, is higher than Virginia's, 6 percent. Washington's is 9.97 percent. 
 Four major corporations have recently moved their headquarters to Fairfax County in Northern Virginia. These include Volkswagen of America, which received a total of $10.6 million in incentives from the county and state to move there from Auburn Hills, Mich. Gerald L. Gordon, president of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, declined to discuss Northrop Grumman.
 ''We brokers have our opinions of where and where not they may be going,'' said Mark Larsen, president of Larsen Commercial, a brokerage firm in Fairfax County, who in the past has represented Northrop in real estate transactions. 
 Mr. Larsen said he was betting on Tysons Corner, the shopping and office hub in Fairfax County right off the Capital Beltway and where Northrop Grumman already leases space.
 ''Defense contractors generally prefer the Virginia side because that's where many of the Department of Defense offices are,'' Mr. Larsen said. 
 Whatever the outcome, said Terry Holzheimer, the director of economic development for Arlington County, Va., Northrop Grumman's move has ''brought out the competitive spirit, let's say that.''

HEADLINE: Feeling at Sea On the Roads Of New China

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
COUNTRY DRIVING 
 A Journey Through China From Farm to Factory 
 By Peter Hessler 
 438 pages. Harper. $27.99. 
 American travel writers over the past century have taken special delight in describing the intricacies, and the lunatic comedy, of driving etiquette in foreign countries. Some enterprising publisher is bound to scoop up the best of these observations and issue a queasy-making anthology: ''Carsick: A Global Reader.''
 When that anthology does arrive, Peter Hessler's new book, ''Country Driving: A Journey Through China From Farm to Factory,'' deserves a special place in it. It's not merely that Mr. Hessler convinces us that the Chinese, being new to driving, are simply awful at it. He makes the additional, and delightful, case that perhaps no other people ''take such joy in driving badly.'' 
 The Chinese rarely use turn signals or windshield wipers or seat belts or headlights. They tailgate and honk like mad. ''People pass on hills; they pass on turns; they pass in tunnels,'' Mr. Hessler writes. ''If they get passed themselves, they immediately try to pass the other vehicle back, as if it were a game.'' 
 The Chinese government is little help. Traffic lights are occasionally mistimed, Mr. Hessler notes, showing green in all directions. A left turn lane might be on the far right side of the road. Highway patrols are so rare that officials put fiberglass statues of police officers at some intersections, to function like traffic-calming human scarecrows. Get a dent? Hop out and haggle for an instant settlement. 
 Mr. Hessler is a staff writer for The New Yorker, and he was that magazine's Beijing correspondent from 2000 to 2007. ''Country Driving'' is his third book about China, after ''River Town'' (2001), which was about two years he spent there teaching English while in the Peace Corps, and ''Oracle Bones'' (2006), a multi-layered survey of that country's past and present. 
 His new book is an exploration of China's burgeoning highway system, and it definitely contains some epic drives: Mr. Hessler, for example, undertakes a 7,000-mile trip across northern China, following the Great Wall all the way from the East China Sea to the Tibetan plateau, his rental car packed with a tent and food supplies that will make your teeth ache: Coca-Cola, Oreo cookies, candy bars, Gatorade. 
 But ''Country Driving'' isn't really an Asian version of William Least Heat-Moon's ''Blue Highways.'' Mr. Hessler's book is more ambitious than its subtitle makes it sound. This work is as much about staying put -- about hunkering down and observing -- as it is about barreling down the highway. 
 Mr. Hessler spends years in a small farming village in the mountains north of Beijing, and more years in a quickly growing city in southeastern China. He watches, and takes careful notes, as both places are irrevocably changed by major new expressways. And every now and again he hits the road himself.
 The big story Mr. Hessler has to tell in ''Country Driving'' is about a country that's feverishly on the move. Speaking of the early years of the last decade, he writes, ''To drive across China was to find yourself in the middle of the largest migration in human history -- nearly one-tenth of the population was on the road, finding new lives away from home.'' His book chronicles the flight from rural China, and from farming and folkways, to new cities and their sprouting factories. 
 The story of this emerging China has been told before, of course, by other writers, and by Mr. Hessler himself, in his previous books and magazine journalism. But the reporting in ''Country Driving'' is impressive in its scope. This book contains dozens of characters and multiple set-pieces and subplots. Along the way Mr. Hessler delivers eloquent disquisitions on everything from how to buy a used car in China and what hospital stays are like to the history of the Mongol conquest and the pros and cons of the Great Wall as a defensive structure. 
 Mr. Hessler is an impeccable compiler of facts, in the John McPhee Eagle Scout mold, and he lays these facts out elegantly. There are moments when you worry he is making a fetish of his clear, careful sentences, moments when tidiness comes awfully close to somnambulance. There isn't much libido in Mr. Hessler's writing -- not a lot of passion, not much self-revelation.
 But like the quiet kid in the back of the classroom who ultimately becomes the best man at your wedding, Mr. Hessler, with his good-naturedness and tact, grows on you. So does his sly humor, which accumulates slowly, like the toothsome crust at the bottom of a rice pot. After picking up his share of hitchhikers in northern China, he begins to define the smell of the sickly-sweet perfume the women often wear: ''Eau de Inner Mongolia.'' 
 And after explaining how Chinese rental car agencies, exasperatingly, ask you to return a car with exactly as much gas as was in it when you drove away, rather than returning it full, he writes: ''The Chinese people had invented the compass, paper, the printing press, gunpowder, the seismograph, the crossbow and the umbrella; they had sailed to Africa in the 15th century; they had constructed the Great Wall; over the past decade they had built their economy at a rate never before seen in the developing world. They could return a car with exactly three-eighths of a tank of gas, but filling it was apparently beyond the realm of cultural possibility.'' 
 As Mr. Heller makes his way across China in a series of rental cars, watching trucks blow past him, he observes that almost any product we buy in the developed world has ''probably already spent time on a Chinese road, and someday it may return there to be recycled.''
 He mourns the countryside that is rapidly vanishing in China, but he also admires the grit of the rural people who escape. ''They had a gift for self-invention,'' he writes, ''that rivaled anything in Dickens.'' 
 ''Country Driving'' is most affecting in its portrayal of lives ripped up at the roots, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. He describes the ''hollow feeling'' many Chinese have, because rapid change has left them exhausted and uncertain. 
 Peter Hessler is a fine tour guide for the new China, a writer who is capable of tossing aside the country's (deplorable) maps and admitting: ''In China, it's not such a terrible thing to be lost, because nobody else knows exactly where they're going, either.''

HEADLINE: Markets Decline on a Sharp Drop in Consumer Confidence

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Nervousness about the economy's underpinnings, particularly the plight of the American consumer, led to a steep sell-off on Wall Street on Tuesday.
 The major indexes fell sharply as the fragility of the economic recovery came into plain view. Consumer confidence weakened to an unexpectedly low level, and the housing market showed steady but slow signs of renewal.
 Investors seemed most startled by a barometer of consumer sentiment, which fell to its lowest level in 10 months in February. They had hoped that a steadily improving jobs market and strength in crucial sectors like manufacturing would translate into rosier household attitudes. 
 But a survey by the Conference Board, a private research group, showed that concerns over the prospects for employment helped drag consumer confidence to a reading of 46, down from 55.9 the previous month and below a forecast of 55. 
 Within minutes, analysts were trading puzzled gasps. ''Shocking drop,'' one research note said. ''A bit suspect,'' another added.
 Stephen P. Wood, chief market strategist for North America at Russell Investments, said the data underscored the idea that the recovery would be ''a slog -- grinding and sluggish.'' 
 ''The consumer has been damaged but it is not dead,'' Mr. Wood said. ''Things are not deteriorating, but they're not measurably improving in housing and jobs.''
 Shortly after the release of the data on consumer confidence, a decline in stocks intensified and spread to all sectors.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 100.97 points, or 0.97 percent, at 10,282.41. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 13.41 points, or 1.21 percent, at 1,094.60. The Nasdaq posted the biggest losses, falling 28.59 points, or 1.28 percent, at 2,213.44. 
 Several big-name manufacturers fell significantly on Tuesday. Shares of Caterpillar dropped 2.36 percent, and Boeing declined 1.88 percent.
 Shares of large financial firms also slid as the government said its list of troubled banks rose to 702 at the end of 2009 -- a 16-year high -- casting doubt on the health of the financial sector. Citigroup dropped 3.18 percent, Wells Fargo shed 2.57 percent, and JPMorgan Chase fell 2.37 percent.
 A report on the housing market offered some signs of hope. Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index rose 0.3 percent in December -- the seventh consecutive month of gains -- with most of the cities improving from November. Compared with a year earlier, prices were 3.08 percent lower -- slightly better than expectations.
 But good news for the housing market is often greeted with hesitation on Wall Street, since home prices remain about 30 percent off their highs in 2006. For now, the momentum appears to be upward -- albeit at an exceedingly slow pace -- helped by the government's stimulus efforts aimed at luring buyers and pre-empting foreclosures.
 Amid the nervousness about the stock market, the dollar strengthened, pushing the price of a euro to $1.35. The price of oil, which tends to rally with the stock market, fell 1.5 percent, to $78.86 a barrel, contributing to losses in shares of energy companies.
 Companies continued to report better-than-expected financial earnings on Tuesday. 
 Home Depot said its profit in the fourth quarter was stronger than expected and said the outlook for the year had improved -- sending its stock up 1.42 percent. On Monday, its competitor Lowe's reported similarly positive earnings. 
 Retailers showed mixed results on Wall Street. Macy's said it expected sales to grow more than expected this year, helping drive its stock up 1.08 percent. Target reported earnings that were 54 percent higher, thanks to robust holiday sales, but its stock fell 1.15 percent. 
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 29/32, to 99 16/32. The yield fell to 3.68 percent, from 3.8 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of two-year notes and four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Major Retailers Post Profits, But Forecasts Are Cautious

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
For retailers, 2010 may be more about winning sales from competitors than tempting consumers to buy more.
 Discounters like Target and Kmart posted improved sales performances on Tuesday, while the department store chain Macy's also forecast better sales in 2010.
 Demand picked up for items that sat out the recession on store shelves. But executives at stores cautioned investors that they did not expect a huge improvement in sales trends this year while unemployment remained high. 
 At Sears, which owns Kmart stores, net income more than doubled, to $430 million, or $3.74 a share, from $190 million, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding store-closing costs and hedge fund gains or losses, earnings in the fourth quarter, ended on Jan. 30, were $3.99 a share. The company's forecast on Jan. 7 was $3.36 to $4.06.
 Analyst estimates were $2.62 to $4.05, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue slipped 0.2 percent, or $33 million, to $13.25 billion, affected by 62 fewer stores. The company also had a 2.5 percent decline at stores in the United States open at least a year, a measure of retail health.
 Macy's said it expected a 1 to 2 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year for the current fiscal year, in contrast to a 5.3 percent decline last year.
 ''While we still see little meaningful near-term improvement in macroeconomic conditions, we do believe there is opportunity to gain market share by increasing same-store sales,'' said Macy's chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren.
 But consumer caution was also evident in weekly sales numbers. Research from the International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs found the same-store sales index rose 0.9 percent in the week ended Saturday, compared with a year earlier. Council research forecasts a 2 percent rise in February same-store sales over all.
 Macy's reported net income, of $466 million, or $1.10 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.77 billion, or $11.33 a share.
 In the fourth quarter, ended on Jan. 30, sales fell 1.1 percent, to $7.85 billion, compared with sales of $7.93 billion in the same period last year. That was above the $7.84 billion that analysts had expected.
 Excluding one-time items, Macy's earned $1.40 a share, 3 cents more than analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected. Some analysts, however, said even that might not have been enough.
 ''After what we've seen, where companies were blowing through consensus numbers and offering guidance that was dimes, not pennies, above'' forecasts, said Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones, ''it has the implication that there's not as much potential for these big earnings surprises to the upside.'' Mr. Arnold has a hold rating on Macy's shares.
 Target said its customers were not buying just essentials, like food, but had added a few more home improvement and apparel items to their baskets. It expects sales of such discretionary merchandise to improve.
 At Target, net income was, $936 million, or $1.24 a share, compared with $609 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding a lower provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30, earnings were $1.17 a share. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.16 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Sales rose 3.7 percent, to $19.72 billion, from $19.0 billion in 2008. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.6 percent. Its gross margin rate increased 1.8 percentage points, to 29.1 percent.
 Target also said it was on track to post its third consecutive gain in same-store sales in February.
 Target's stock slipped 1.2 percent, falling 58 cents, to $50.06. Sears fell 1.9 percent, dropping $1.86, to $93.80. And Macy's rose 1.1 percent, up 20 cents, to $18.67.

HEADLINE: For the Census, Knowing Where to Look In New York Is Half the Battle

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
One River Place blends easily into the dense forest of Manhattan skyscrapers, its vanity address camouflaging its precise location. Still, even in New York City, a 40-story tower containing 900 apartments should be difficult to miss. 
 But the Census Bureau did. 
 The apartment building at 500 12th Avenue, between 41st and 42nd Streets, was one of the first residential developments on the western fringes of Hell's Kitchen when it opened in 2000. It was so far west, in fact, that it never showed up on the residential property map the bureau prepared for the 2010 census.
 New York City planners discovered the oversight and alerted the bureau. Likewise, the city told the bureau about two nearby 60-story buildings with a total of 1,400 apartments that opened last spring after the bureau had finished compiling addresses for this census. 
 As the federal Census Bureau starts its most ambitious effort ever to count the country, no other city presents a bigger challenge than New York, with its huge immigrant population crammed into easily missed and often illegal nooks and crannies. 
 In all, the city has provided Census officials the addresses of at least 127,000 apartments or homes -- nearly 4 percent of all the housing in the city -- that the bureau did not have. Most of the addresses are in one-, two- and three-family homes that had been subdivided, legally and illegally. 
 A decade ago, 55 percent of the census forms in New York were sent back, compared with the national rate of 67 percent. In some city neighborhoods, the response rate was less than 40 percent. 
 ''As a place of unparalleled population diversity and an eclectic mix of housing types, New York City has always been hard to count,'' said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the population division of New York's Department of City Planning. ''This is especially true in the last decade, when the city experienced voluminous housing growth.''
 The 2010 count of New York has not officially begun, but city demographers have already discovered about 300,000 people, including the tenants of those three Manhattan buildings, whom the bureau might have missed because it did not have their addresses. 
 They have also highlighted neighborhoods -- including Washington Heights in Manhattan, Astoria in Queens and Bay Ridge in Brooklyn -- where roughly 600,000 immigrants who arrived over the last decade have settled and how to find them. 
 Dozens of city workers have fanned out across the city, tallying mailboxes and doorbells on hundreds of homes where multiple families might be living or where tenants might be squirreled away in illegally converted attics and basements. The Census Bureau needs to ''see behind the door,'' Dr. Salvo said.
 The decennial census is about a lot more than counting heads. The count is vital in reapportioning Congressional and state legislative districts, and in the distribution of billions of dollars in federal aid. This year, everyone will get the same form with just 10 questions, including the names and the number of household residents, their age, sex and race and if they are of Hispanic origin. 
 The questionnaires will be mailed to more than three million New York households in about two weeks and are due back by April 1. Filling out such a short form and returning it in a prepaid envelope might seem simple enough (and takes less time, the bureau says, than hard-boiling an egg). 
 But mindful of the obstacles, the Census Bureau and New York City officials have embarked on an unprecedented cooperative campaign to increase compliance. 
 The bureau's New York regional office has hired 70 workers to reach out to ethnic groups, clergy members and civic groups to help promote the count. It has rolled out a media blitz that includes billboards and vans that have traveled throughout the city. And the bureau is coordinating closely with Dr. Salvo and Stacey Cumberbatch, who is the city's full-time census coordinator.
 Her office has reached out to groups like the United African Congress and the Y.M.C.A.'s New Americans Initiative to brief recent immigrants about the importance of the census. 
 Beginning in late March, the Census Bureau will provide Ms. Cumberbatch with real-time questionnaire return rates by neighborhood so she can dispatch follow-up teams. 
 ''It is essential that New York City receive an accurate census count, because the census is statistical reality -- a reality that will define us for the next 10 years,'' Dr. Salvo said. ''If you're missed in the census enumeration, it's like you don't exist.''
 The city and the Census Bureau hope to avoid a repeat of the 1990 census, when the city challenged the count and the bureau acknowledged that it had missed more than 240,000 New Yorkers.
 Because the bureau relies, in part, on the previous census in compiling its list of residential addresses, its records are often outdated. In some cases, people are living at street addresses, like Riverside Boulevard in Manhattan over former railyards in the West 60s and 70s, that did not even exist in 2000. 
 This time the bureau is aiming for a questionnaire return rate in New York of 70 percent. 
 ''There are some census tracts that could easily meet that, like the Upper East Side, where there are homeowners, English speakers,'' said Lester A. Farthing, the bureau's New York regional director. ''Our biggest challenge is working on tracts where the mail response was low. You need to saturate New York to get the word out.''
 The bureau will open sites throughout the city to help people fill out the questionnaires and to provide forms in various languages -- the mailed forms are in English or, in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, in English and Spanish. One key message: None of the information is shared with any other government agencies.
 ''Our greatest challenge is trying to convince the majority of the foreign-born population that the census is safe, that you're not going to be hurt or harmed,'' Mr. Farthing said. 
 The bureau is concentrating on neighborhoods that are considered hard to count because residents are disproportionately poor, unemployed, live in apartment buildings, have no telephones, have moved there recently or are single parents. 
 People who do not respond to the survey will get a follow-up form, and if they ignore that, they will get a visit from an enumerator or census taker; 40,000 were hired in New York in 2000. 
 ''If you're worried about someone coming to your door,'' Mr. Farthing said, ''the answer is, mail it back.'' 
 The City Planning Department has been so aggressive in pursuing people the census might miss that demographers have dubbed it ''the Salvo effect.'' Acting as human bloodhounds, 60 agency workers have spent part of the past three years combing through records and conducting on-site inspections.
 ''It's amazing how many cable TV lines go into a house where one family supposedly lives,'' Dr. Salvo said.
 In 2000, the city's population officially topped eight million for the first time, thanks largely to the Salvo effect. In 2008, the population stood at 8,363,710, according to the bureau's annual American Community Survey. Dr. Salvo expects the 2010 census to record 8.4 million residents.
 To find overlooked New Yorkers, researchers even considered using water bills to estimate how many times toilets were flushed and gauge population based on average human needs. But, Dr. Salvo said, ''That is too unreliable, from an empirical standpoint.''

HEADLINE: InterContinental Takes a Chance With a New Hotel

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Boutique and high-style hotels have sprung up in New York in recent years, their lounges studded with celebrities and their restaurant menus developed by famous chefs. But big hotels that cater to tourists and business travelers have come along only rarely.
 The 607-room InterContinental, scheduled to open in July in the heart of the theater district, will be the largest hotel built from the ground up since the nearby Westin, with 863 rooms, was completed by the same developer in 2002. 
 With the hotel industry struggling in the downturn, this might not seem a propitious time to be opening a large hotel. While room occupancy in Manhattan remains the highest in the country -- an average of 81.6 percent last year, according to PKF Consulting, which specializes in the lodging industry -- hotels drastically cut their rates to attract customers. Revenue per average room, the standard industry measure, declined 25.8 percent, to $196.18, from $264.41, more than anywhere else. 
 Industry specialists said that a decline of one percentage point in room revenue results in two percentage points of net losses because of the fixed costs associated with hotels, including labor, insurance and taxes. 
 The InterContinental was designed to be a refuge from the surrounding hustle and bustle, said Robert Snyder, an executive vice president at Tishman Hotel and Realty, the developer of the 36-story hotel, on Eighth Avenue at 44th Street. 
 The hotel's interior was designed by Jeffrey Beers, who was responsible for the recent well-received renovation of the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach. It will be ''quiet, not glitzy,'' with lots of dark wood and stone, Mr. Snyder said.
 Mr. Snyder said he was heartened by signs that the market was beginning to pick up, which is good news for the industry. At the Westin, at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street, which slashed rates last year to keep its rooms filled, advance bookings have increased significantly and operators no longer see a need to do as much discounting, he said. Just as New York has taken the deepest hit in the recession, he said, it is likely to make the swiftest recovery. 
 Hotel occupancy in Manhattan increased 8.5 percent in January from the previous January, the fifth consecutive month of improvement, according to Smith Travel Research of Hendersonville, Tenn. So far, rates have not kept pace. But if occupancy continues to rise, operators will have the confidence to begin charging more, industry specialists said.
 ''We're not out of the woods, but I'm getting more optimistic every day,'' said John A. Fox, a senior vice president at PKF. 
 Still, for many hotel operators who financed their properties in the boom years with complex layers of debt, there was plenty to worry about.
 Bradley Burwell, a senior associate at CB Richard Ellis, the giant brokerage, estimated that at least half the hotel mortgages in New York were in technical default, meaning that the properties were not generating enough cash flow to maintain the debt service reserve agreed to in their loan documents. What has saved many owners from actually defaulting is that most are pegged to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which remains very low. ''That's essentially free money that people have today,'' Mr. Burwell said. ''It's saving a lot of deals from going into default.''
 A dozen New York City hotels have defaulted on their loans or are in foreclosure, receivership or bankruptcy, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research firm. Among these were the W Hotel on Union Square, the Four Seasons on 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues, and the Time Hotel on 49th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenues.
 But many other hotels are facing challenges. Realpoint, a ratings agency in Horsham, Pa., that monitors hotel loans that have been packaged as securities, had 31 New York City hotels on its ''watch list,'' including the Gansevoort in the meatpacking district, the Bryant Park Hotel at 40th Street near the Avenue of the Americas and the Park Central Hotel on Seventh Avenue and 56th Street.
 As with other real estate sectors, lenders are reluctant to foreclose on troubled hotels, and most are choosing instead to wait for a recovery, said David Loeb, a managing director at Robert W. Baird & Company, a financial services firm based in Milwaukee. ''There's some chance that might work,'' he said, ''that if you are just patient, these hotels may get back in compliance'' with the terms of their loans.
 Though the Westin was also on Realpoint's watch list because its securitized loan was due to mature next month, the mortgage was recently extended for one year, Mr. Snyder said.
 Bjorn Hanson, a hotel specialist at New York University, said the downturn had been hardest on hotels that got the overflow business when hotels in more desirable locations were fully booked. Boutique hotels have also suffered. ''In this economic environment, many travelers see them as frivolous,'' he said. 
 In December, WestLB A.G., a German lender, sued to foreclose on its $52.3 million loan to the Cooper Square Hotel, a 145-room boutique hotel with several other layers of debt, which opened in late 2008 near Astor Place. ''It's a great example of a hotel that was built with way too much money,'' Mr. Burwell said. He said that the rooms were small and cost about $828,000 each to build. 
 As one gauge of today's hotel values, Hersha Hospitality Trust, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, bought two hotels developed by Sam Chang on 39th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, Hampton Inn Times Square South and Candlewood Suites Times Square, for $295,000 a room after an earlier deal, believed to be at a much higher price, fell through. 
 Mr. Hanson said the industry's recovery was likely to be impeded by the large number of new hotels being built in the city, most planned when the economy was soaring. They were expected to put further pressure on room rates by offering introductory discounts. Forty hotels, with 7,200 rooms, were under construction, which will swell the city's inventory by about 10 percent, said Bobby Bowers, a senior vice president at Smith Travel.
 ''We're not thinking that 2010 is going to be particularly great,'' Mr. Bowers said. ''But I would much rather be opening a hotel now, as opposed to a year ago.''
 Mr. Burwell said the new hotels would not compete directly with the InterContinental. Most will have fewer than 300 rooms, and many will be far smaller. And nearly all will be below 42nd Street, though the Related Companies was developing a large hotel with an undetermined number of rooms on 42nd Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues.
 Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which operates the Westin, recently announced that it would redevelop the dowdy 665-room Sheraton Manhattan in Times Square, on 51st Street and Seventh Avenue, as part of an effort to reinvigorate the Sheraton brand. 
 With a relatively modest 10,000 square feet of meeting space, the InterContinental was being marketed to business travelers and tourists rather than for large meetings. Each room will have a laptop computer. (There will be a charge for Internet use.) Not to be outdone by the new boutique hotels, the InterContinental will also have a celebrity chef, Todd English of Boston, who is best known for the Olives restaurants. 
 Tom McConnell, a senior managing director at the brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield, said he expected the hotel would attract business from events at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Customers booking large blocks of rooms want to be in Times Square rather than downtown and are often notinterested in either low-end chain hotels or boutique ones. ''From the Javits standpoint, you could use three or four of these properties,'' Mr. McConnell said.

HEADLINE: Just Like Mombot Used to Make

BYLINE: By IAN DALY. 
Yasue Aoi contributed reporting from Tokyo.

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
 IN an empty fluorescent-lighted hallway on the second floor of Smith Hall here at Carnegie Mellon University, Prof. Paul Rybski and a pair of graduate students showed off their most advanced creation. 
 The culmination of two years of research and the collective expertise of 17 faculty members, undergraduates and doctoral students in the Human Robot Interaction Group, it is a robot outfitted with a $20,000 laser navigation system, sonar sensors and a Point Grey Bumblebee 2 stereo camera that functions as its eyes, which stare out from its clay-colored plastic, gender-neutral face.
 With Dr. Rybski looking on like a proud parent, a bearded graduate student clacked away at a laptop on a roving service cart, and the robot rolled forward to fulfill its primary function: the delivery of one foil-wrapped Nature Valley trail-mix flavor granola bar.
 ''Hello, I'm the Snackbot,'' it said in a voice not unlike that of HAL 9000, from ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' as its rectangular LED ''mouth'' pulsated to form the words. ''I've come to deliver snacks to Ian. Is Ian here?'' 
 I responded affirmatively. ''Oh, hello, Ian,'' it said. ''Here is your order. I believe it was a granola bar, right?''
 Yes, it was. ''All right, go ahead and take your snack. I'm sure it would be good, but I wouldn't know. I prefer a snack of electricity.''
 Designed to gather information on how robots interact with people (and how to improve homo-robo relations), the Snackbot has been carefully considered for maximum approachability in every detail, from its height to its color. The snack, not surprisingly, is the central component of that approachability.
 ''We figured, what better way to get people to interact with a robot than have something that offers them food?'' Dr. Rybski said.
 The Snackbot is but one soldier in a veritable army of new robots designed to serve and cook food and, in the process, act as good-will ambassadors, and salesmen, for a more automated future.
 In 2006, after four years of research and more than a quarter-million-dollar investment, Fanxing Science and Technology, a company in Shenzhen, China, unveiled what was called the ''world's first cooking robot'' -- AIC-AI Cooking Robot -- able, at the touch of a button, to fry, bake, boil and steam its way through thousands of Chinese delicacies from at least three culinary regions.
 AIC-AI needs a special stove for cooking, but many of the mechanized culinary wizards developed since then can work on almost any kind of stove, as long as the robot is either shown ahead of time how a particular stove works or the stove's characteristics are programmed into the robot's software. 
 In 2008, scientists at the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory in Lausanne, Switzerland, came out with one such teachable chef, the Chief Cook Robot, which can make omelets (ham and Gruyere were in its first) and bears a resemblance to the Pillsbury Doughboy. That same year, at the Osaka Museum of Creative Industries in Japan, a programmable robot began preparing takoyaki (octopus balls) from scratch, a chef's bandana wrapped jauntily around its upper module.
 Last June, at the International Food Machinery and Technology Expo in Tokyo, a broad-shouldered Motoman SDA-10 robot with spatulas for arms made okonomiyaki (savory pancakes) for attendees; another robot grabbed sushi with an eerily realistic hand; and still another, the Dynamizer, sliced cucumbers at inhumanly fast speeds and occasionally complained about being tired and wanting to go home.
 Then, a month later in Nagoya, Japan, the Famen restaurant opened, with two giant yellow robot arms preparing up to 800 bowls of ramen a day. When it's slow, the robots act out a scripted comedy routine and spar with knives.
 ''The concept of this restaurant is that Robot No. 1 is the manager, which boils the noodles, and Robot No. 2 is the deputy manager, which prepares for soup and puts toppings,'' said Famen's owner, Kenji Nagaya. ''Human staffs are working for the two robots.''
 In the throes of an economic downturn, with unemployment rates mounting, the very idea of a robot chef might seem indulgent at best -- at worst, downright offensive. But these robots aren't likely to be running the grill stations or bringing you chowder anytime soon -- and the bad economy might be part of the reason. At $100,000 a pair, Mr. Nagaya said, the cost of his robots is ''too high to make bowls of ramen.''
 But they may be worth the cost at Mr. Nagaya's other workplace, the robotics company Aisei in Nagoya, where he is the president. ''I have made and programmed industrial robots at our company so long, and I was thinking to set up a place to promote our business,'' he said. ''I love ramen a lot, and ramen restaurants are always featured in magazines and on television in Japan, so I thought opening a ramen shop with robots would have a huge impact on promoting our business.''
 Mikio Shimizu, the president of Squse, a company in Kyoto, Japan, that is responsible for the sushi-grabbing hand, said that his ultimate goal is to become the world's largest maker of functional prosthetic hands.
 Narito Hosomi, the president of Toyo Riki, a company in Osaka, Japan, that programs the robots responsible for the octopus balls and savory pancakes, said that the final destination for the robots, which cost $200,000 each, was more likely a factory than a kitchen.
 But ''it's not interesting to watch robots welding,'' Dr. Hosomi said. ''If you see robots do the same work as you do in everyday life with the tools you use, it would be easier to understand the functional capability of robots. The okonomiyaki robot is a medium for that purpose. We say a robot can make okonomiyaki, takoyaki -- well, what would you like a robot to do for you?''
 While cooking is certainly a more universal way to showcase a robot's abilities than, say, laser-welding, it is also unique in its ability to tackle something deeper: namely, the public's collective ''Terminator''-fueled angst over a future populated by vengeful hominoid machines.
 Dr. Heather Knight, a roboticist at the NASAJet Propulsion Laboratory, said that the industry is trying to change ''the perception of robots.''
 ''The Japanese have always been more comfortable with it, but particularly in the West, there's this whole Frankenstein thing that if we try to make something in the image of man, to make a new creature, we're stealing the role of God, and it's going to turn out wrong because that's not our role,'' she said. ''So how do you change this perception that robots are going to be way too intelligent and destroy us? One of the fastest ways to people's hearts is food, right? Any girlfriend or wife would say that.''
 In fact, Dr. Aude Billard, whose team designed the egg-handling Chief Cook Robot, said that she decided on omelets because ''it was the first dish my partner cooked for me.'' The omelet making was meant to show how a robot could be ''taught'' to accomplish complex tasks. It was also ''something that all the guys in the lab knew sufficiently well to be able to train the robot,'' she said.
 But perhaps the biggest accomplishment of this new wave of sustenance-bearing machines is their departure from what defined their predecessors. The Fritz Lang level of efficiency normally associated with robots is notably absent -- and that's no accident.
 ''A simple rule of robotic personality seems to be: don't make things the most efficient way,'' said Magnus Wurzer, who has been running the Vienna-based Roboexotica, a festival where scientists have gone to build, showcase and discuss ''cocktail robots'' since 1999.
 One entry, Beerbot, detects approaching people and asks for beer money. When it acquires enough, it ''buys'' itself a beer. Bystanders can watch it flow into a transparent bladder. As for other humanizing behaviors, ''like a robot that doesn't stop short at lighting a cigarette but actually goes ahead and smokes it?'' Mr. Wurzer says, ''We had that.''
 Roboexotica has inspired a stateside version as well, which just had its third annual celebration in San Francisco.
 And in at least one case in Europe, a robot actually got behind a bar. From 1999 to 2002, a scarlet-eyed metal robot named Cynthia poured drinks at Cynthia's Bridge Bar and Lounge in London. But according to Mr. Wurzer, ''she was too costly to maintain once the bar was sold by the robot's maker.''
 One reviewer at virtual-london.com, a travel-information Web site, said that Cynthia's problems went deeper: ''She whirls into action, pouring drinks to perfection, mixing them, recounting awful jokes and chuckling to herself while frightened customers feel grateful she's not allowed out from behind the bar.''
 However hard it may be to master, humanizing behavior was what the Snackbot's creator were seeking, too.
 ''How do you get a service robot to interact with humans?'' Dr. Rybski asked. ''That's a real hard problem. It's different when you're working with a human versus a pipe on an assembly line.''
 To prepare, one of Dr. Rybski's graduate students, a slender and quiet Korean woman named Min Kyung Lee, spent two days staked out behind a campus hot dog vendor, taking notes on how he interacted with his customers. She used what she learned to program the robot's dialogue.
 Aside from the obvious challenges of instilling a machine with personality is the other, long-held axiom in the world of robotics: what might seem second-nature to humans can be all but impossible to teach a machine.
 Mr. Wurzer said that one scientist at Roboexotica built a robot solely dedicated to the preparation of mojitos -- ''with the grinding and stomping and all.'' And yet the most challenging task for all the robots, he said, was probably the one thing that no human bartender ever botches: handling the ice. 
 The Chief Cook Robot still relies on human beings to crack the eggs -- the shells are far too delicate for its metal hands. The okonomiyaki-making robot still needs the vegetables prepped, a task arguably better suited to a robot.
 And while robots could certainly be developed and trained for these tasks, some culinary arts are so delicate and ancient -- so venerated and sanctified -- that even these machines' creators wouldn't trust them to inhuman hands.
 ''Would you like to have a robot hand that makes sushi?'' said Mr. Shimizu, of Squse, which programmed the sushi-grabbing hand. ''Do you really want it? For making good sushi, a robot never can beat a human professional sushi chef. A robot never can go beyond a human's skill or human intelligence.''
 But the real obstacle to a world full of mechanized sous-chefs and simulated rage-filled robo-Gordon Ramsays may be something much harder to fake: none of these robots can taste.
 Keizo Shimamoto, who writes a blog on ramen noodles and has eaten at Famen, the two-robot Japanese restaurant, said that the establishment was ''kind of dead'' when he ate there last year. Though the owner said that people do taste the food, according to Mr. Shimamoto, ''It was a little disappointing.''
 It's one thing to get people to stop by to see the robots. ''But to keep the customers coming back,'' he said, ''you need better soup.''

HEADLINE: Acai, a Global Super Fruit, Is Dinner in the Amazon

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

DATELINE: CAMETA, Brazil 

 BODY:
 CLUSTERED high up in the slender, tilting palms of the eastern Amazon, the little purple orbs known as acai look mighty, like blueberries that took a very wrong turn out of Maine. These are no mere muffin makers, though.
 Virtually unknown outside the Amazon two decades ago, and until 2000 not exported from Brazil -- its major producer -- acai (pronounced ah-sigh-EE) is now an international celebrity, riding the wave of the antioxidant craze and rain-forest chic. On the beaches of Rio de Janeiro, surfers seeking an energy boost spoon acai smoothies from bowls. In the United States, companies touting its antioxidant powers blend the fruit into Snapple red tea; Red Brick Pizza's frantically trendy multigrain, whole-wheat artisan crust; and everything from dietary supplements to beauty products.
 But for families who live here along the winding, interlaced rivers at the hub of acai production, the fruit has long been a vital part of their diet, a cheap way to fill up and a taste of home. And now, for some, it is a source of newfound prosperity.
 In places like Cameta, a town of about 117,000, and Belem, the capital of Para State, a bowl of acai pulp is a filling side dish especially valued by poorer families. 
 Unlike the pulp used in Rio's smoothies, the kind here is not presweetened or frozen, but fresh from cylindrical machines known as batedores de acai, ''acai beaters,'' that remove the thin layer of fruit from the pit. Most every neighborhood has stands or small stores where customers get a daily or weekly supply.
 Belem's most famous acai market, the Feira do Acai, near the city's 17th-century periwinkle-colored Ver-o-Peso market building, bustles before dawn as wholesalers stack baskets of the fruit on the cobblestone square. 
 By 9 a.m., the countless stands around the city have opened for business, processing the fruit into thick, medium or thin varieties depending on how much water is added. 
 When the merchants are ready they hang red signs to indicate that acai is for sale. As in towns throughout the region, in Belem residents pick up pulp by the liter to have with lunch or dinner.
 Even some chain supermarkets have in-house acai counters. Diego Lopes, a 21-year-old acai processor at a Lider supermarket in Belem, says he has acai with lunch and dinner every day.
 ''Think of it as a cheeseburger,'' Mr. Lopes said, explaining to an American reporter. ''You can't have a meal there without a cheeseburger, right?''
 Acai's international reputation as an energy booster and diet aid tickles those who grew up with it as a caloric side dish. 
 ''I find it funny,'' said Leticia Galvao, a psychologist who was having a lunch of seafood and acai with her husband and 1-year-old daughter at a restaurant called Point do Acai. ''Generally, when you have acai here, you take a nap. There, it's an energy drink.''
 Her husband, Cid, added: ''After this bowl, I'm going to try to watch the soccer game. But I'll fall asleep, almost certainly.''
 Ms. Galvao said that her brother, a doctor living in the southern state of Parana, wasn't a big acai fan growing up. But these days he asks anyone visiting him from Belem for a liter of the fresh stuff. 
 ''Acai has the taste of our land,'' she said. ''It's a way of reconnecting. It's a taste of childhood.''
 Although acai smoothies are rare in Para, deep purple acai is a popular flavor at two big ice cream chains based in Belem, Cairu and Ice Bode, and the white-and-purple swirl of acai and tapioca is especially refreshing. You can also find acai candy in gift shops, and acai tarts in bakeries.
 Sugar is an issue, though. Many locals who insist it should never be added to the fruit -- a crowd that trends older and more rural -- crave unsweetened acai as other traditionalists love their coffee black, their single-malt Scotch neat or their chocolate at 80 percent cacao. And like black coffee, straight Scotch or bitter chocolate, unsweetened acai takes some getting used to.
 The velvety texture of the thicker varieties is wonderful, but the taste is more -- how to put this? -- earthy. O.K., it tastes like dirt. Making matters worse, the manioc flour that's often mixed in to thicken it has the consistency of sand.
 But visitors who hold back on the sugar will find a more complex flavor that, while it remains grassy and earthy, is also fresher and purer than acai that's been pasteurized, frozen and subjected to the corrupting (though delicious) influences of, say, bananas or granola. 
 While the old ways of eating acai continue in the Amazon, increased demand elsewhere in the world has driven up prices and made life easier for people like 53-year-old Orisvaldo Ferreira de Souza; his younger brother, Josivaldo; and their elderly parents.
 The de Souzas live in a battered wooden home on stilts on Itanduba Island, about an hour by boat from Cameta's town center. Like the families who live up and down the river from them, they make much of their living off the acai harvest from what they calculate is 8,000 acai palms on 35 acres.
 ''Two or three years ago, we had a lot of trouble selling the product,'' Orisvaldo Ferreira de Souza said. ''We had to bring it to town, and sometimes we came back without selling it.''
 Back then, he said, a standard ''lata,'' or 14-kilogram basket, brought about two or three Brazilian reais, or roughly five cents a pound at today's exchange rates. But now, the harvesters don't even have to leave their land: buyers ply the river right up to their rickety wooden pier offering 10 reais or more. ''Just yesterday, six buyers came by,'' he said. ''We sold 10 baskets each to two of them.''
 Some would have been sold in town for local consumption. But more and more of it has been hauled in trucks on rutted highways and over ferry crossings to processing plants like those near Belem, six hours away. From there, frozen packs of presweetened pulp (neither the fruit not the fresh pulp last long) are shipped to the rest of Brazil or, increasingly, the rest of the world. 
 Exact export figures are hard to come by, but in Para, which produces almost 90 percent of Brazil's acai, the export category that essentially refers to acai pulp surged from 380 metric tons in 2000 to 1,700 metric tons in 2005 -- to 9,400 metric tons last year.
 For the de Souzas and families around them, added income has meant that they can buy meat and chicken in town, attach motors to their boats, purchase power generators or solar panels and afford parabolic antennas and televisions to watch soccer, news and soaps.
 That's a big change from when Mr. de Souza was growing up, learning to scale trees to break off the big bunches of acai hanging just below the palm fronds. 
 Ivan Saiki, director of Cam-ta, a cooperative and fruit processor in Tome-Acu, another major acai-producing municipality, said: ''Before the boom, the harvest came and the acai was worth practically nothing. Before, nobody had television, nobody had a motorized canoe. Now many have their own electricity at home. It's greatly improved the life of the river communities.''
 Many farmers can now hire workers to harvest acai -- which mostly still involves scaling trees with bare feet protected only by a strap called a peconha, made from bark strips or leaves. 
 The fruit was traditionally collected from wild palms. Now companies have acai plantations, and collectors are raising more acai palms on their land, according to Antonio Cordeiro de Santana, an agricultural economist at the Rural Federal University of the Amazon. With cultivation more concentrated, resistance to disease and productivity have decreased, he said, even as the number of acai palms in Para has exploded.
 Still, money flows in as the rest of the world works hard to slip acai into ever more products (Acai Mango Zinger tea! Emergen-C Acai Berry packets!).
 Though the price increase has been good for those raising acai, it comes at a cost to urban poor families.
 In 2004, a study showed that 61 percent of those making minimum wage or less in the Belem area ate acai daily but that only 16 percent of the highest-income groups did so. 
 That would seem to threaten a valuable source of nutrition for the poor. But Mr. Cordeiro said that recent surveys that his team conducted in metropolitan Belem found that consumption of acai had not slowed, although some poorer families were buying the more watery variety.
 Across the street from a woman selling acai out of a dilapidated wooden shack in the poor Jurunas neighborhood of Belem, a grizzled older man named Joao Manuel said that higher prices have not stopped him from eating acai. ''Fifteen years ago, it was like beans for us,'' he said. ''Now, it's more expensive than beans. We eat it just the same; it's only that now we feel it in our wallets.''
 ''For me, even without sugar,'' he said, ''acai is sweet.''

HEADLINE: Outlook for All Points West Festival in Jersey City This Summer Is in Doubt

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
It may be only February, but for the concert industry the summer is already here, with artists completing their tour schedules and festivals releasing their lineups. Bonnaroo, in Tennessee in June, has announced most of its 100-plus acts, and blogs have been buzzing for weeks about who is expected for Lollapalooza in Chicago in August. 
 One name, however, has been conspicuously absent from the chatter: All Points West, the three-day festival at Liberty State Park in Jersey City. Begun two years ago by the promoters behind Coachella, the trend-setting event in the California desert, All Points West got off to a rocky start, with fan complaints in 2008 about slow ferries from Manhattan, and heavy rain last year. 
 Executives at AEG Live, the promoter of All Points West, say they have not yet decided whether it will return for a third year. 
 ''There is no question that our biggest challenge is finding suitable headliners, and it has been more challenging this year than in the past,'' said Mark Shulman, a veteran talent buyer for AEG. ''No final determination of any kind has been made for 2010.''
 But many in the music industry doubt whether All Points West, which has been held in August, will return this summer. A number of prominent booking agents and other executives, most of whom requested anonymity because they did not want to jeopardize business with AEG, said that nothing had been booked and that it would be very difficult for AEG to put a lineup together this late in the year, since most artists' plans for the summer were already set.
 ''It seems more and more clear these days that a headlining artist is a necessity to run a productive and successful festival,'' said Frank Riley of High Road Touring, which represents Wilco, Feist and Ryan Adams, among others. ''Without a clear headliner in place at this point, it seems unlikely that the festival will take place in August 2010.''
 In its first year All Points West was headlined by Radiohead and Jack Johnson; last year it was Jay-Z, Coldplay and Tool. Officials at Liberty State Park said that AEG had applied for dates there this summer but that none had been confirmed.
 For many years the summer concert field was dominated by amphitheater and arena tours, but over the last decade festivals have sprouted up around the country. With thin margins and a challenging economy, however, some of them have already begun to disappear: Rothbury, a two-year-old festival in Michigan presented by AEG and others, has been postponed for 2010, and Pemberton, near Vancouver in Canada, was put on in 2008 but has been on hiatus for the last two years.
 The New York market has proved particularly difficult for festival producers, who cite high costs and competition with the city's rich cultural calendar as obstacles to establishing a successful event. Over the last 10 years a number of festivals have been tried in and around New York, including Field Day, Bonnaroo N.E., Across the Narrows and Vineland, but none have taken root.
 AEG executives acknowledged difficulties with All Points West and indicated that it would need an overhaul to continue.
 ''I don't know how great an experience it was for the fans,'' said Skip Paige, a vice president with Goldenvoice, an AEG affiliate that has been involved in All Points West. ''If we're going to do that show again, we want to be able to make it great and have it be something that people respect.''

HEADLINE: Zuckerman Courts G.O.P. While Ford Polls Voters

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
As they weigh whether to make a bid for the Senate seat held by Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the publisher of The Daily News, is quietly reaching out to state Republican leaders, and Harold E. Ford Jr., a former congressman, has conducted a poll of New York voters, people told of the moves said. 
 The behind-the-scenes activities highlight how seriously both are examining a run for the office, which, until now, Ms. Gillibrand had appeared likely to hold onto with little competition. 
 Mr. Zuckerman spoke privately with former Gov. George E. Pataki several days ago to solicit advice on how to run on the Republican ballot line, should he enter the campaign, according to two people told of the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity, for fear of offending the two powerful men. 
 Mr. Pataki advised Mr. Zuckerman, 72, to hire Republican operatives in New York to assist his campaign and cement his relationship with the party, a person briefed on the talks said. Mr. Zuckerman, a real estate and publishing tycoon, is not registered with a party in New York and would need permission from the state Republican committee to run on its ballot line. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, David M. Catalfamo, confirmed that the former governor had spoken with Mr. Zuckerman and ''holds him in very high regard.'' Mr. Catalfamo declined to comment on what the men discussed. 
 Around the same time, Mr. Zuckerman met with Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the Republican state party, whose support would ease the path to the Republican nomination, these people said. Spokesmen for Mr. Cox and Mr. Zuckerman declined to comment. 
 In conversations, Mr. Zuckerman has told party officials that voter unrest has given the Republicans a rare chance of retaking a Senate seat in New York. The state's voters last elected a Republican to the Senate in 1992, when Alfonse M. D'Amato defeated Attorney General Robert Abrams, a Democrat. 
 As Mr. Zuckerman mulls a Republican candidacy, Mr. Ford, a former five-term representative from Tennessee, tested the viability of a potential Democratic Party campaign against Ms. Gillibrand with a detailed telephone poll over the weekend.
 The survey, overseen by the Democratic pollster Douglas E. Schoen, gauged voters' reactions to a variety of claims about Mr. Ford and Ms. Gillibrand. In one series of questions, respondents were asked to react to descriptions of Ms. Gillibrand as a product of ''corrupt'' Albany who voted ''95 percent of the time'' with New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer; helped develop strategies for the tobacco industry; and had a conservative record out of step with voters.
 In another line of inquiry that appears to test Mr. Ford's vulnerabilities, he was characterized as a carpetbagger, a member of the National Rifle Association, a flip-flopper on the issue of legalizing same-sex marriage and a Wall Street executive who has not disclosed his bonus.
 The poll took about 20 minutes, according to two people who participated in it, took detailed notes about the questions and later shared them with The New York Times. Mr. Ford appears to have paid for it out of his own pocket. Spokesmen for Mr. Ford and Ms. Gillibrand declined to comment. 
 The survey offers a glimpse into Mr. Ford's potential campaign strategy. It asked whether a person would be more or less likely to vote for him if he were endorsed by The New York Post, former Mayor Edward I. Koch and the onetime Senate hopeful Caroline Kennedy. It also asked about the potential impact of endorsements for Ms. Gillibrand from President Obama, the Long Island newspaper Newsday and Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo.
 Some questions appeared to assess possible campaign themes and slogans for Mr. Ford, 39, who is expected to decide next week whether to run. The poll sought feedback on the assertion that he was a ''national leader'' of African-Americans, in the style of Mr. Obama; had a bold plan to revitalize the economy; and was independent of the troubles in Albany.

HEADLINE: Gates Sees Danger in Europe's Anti-Military Views

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has long called European contributions to NATO inadequate, said Tuesday that public and political opposition to the military had grown so great in Europe that it was directly affecting operations in Afghanistan and impeding the alliance's broader security goals.
 ''The demilitarization of Europe -- where large swaths of the general public and political class are averse to military force and the risks that go with it -- has gone from a blessing in the 20th century to an impediment to achieving real security and lasting peace in the 21st,'' he told NATO officers and officials in a speech at the National Defense University, the Defense Department-financed graduate school for military officers and diplomats. 
 A perception of European weakness, he warned, could provide a ''temptation to miscalculation and aggression'' by hostile powers.
 The meeting was a prelude to the alliance's review this year of its basic mission plan for the first time since 1999. ''Right now,'' Mr. Gates said, ''the alliance faces very serious, long-term, systemic problems.'' 
 Mr. Gates's blunt comments came just three days after the coalition government of the Netherlandscollapsed in a dispute over keeping Dutch troops in Afghanistan. It now appears almost certain that most of the 2,000 Dutch troops there will be withdrawn this year. And polls show that the Afghanistan war has grown increasingly unpopular in nearly every European country.
 The defense secretary, putting a sharper point on his past criticisms, outlined how NATO shortfalls were exacting a material toll in Afghanistan. The alliance's failure to finance needed helicopters and cargo aircraft, for example, was ''directly impacting operations,'' he said.
 Mr. Gates said that NATO also needed more aerial refueling tankers and intelligence-gathering equipment ''for immediate use on the battlefield.''
 Yet alliance members, he noted, were far from reaching their spending commitments, with only 5 of 28 having reached the established target: 2 percent of gross domestic product for defense. By comparison, the United States spends more than 4 percent of its G.D.P. on its military.
 Dana Allin, a senior fellow with the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, called Mr. Gates's remarks ''very striking.''
 ''Whether this is a conscious statement to sound a real sharp warning, there's no question that the frustration among the American military establishment is palpable regarding coalition operations in Afghanistan,'' he said.
 Mr. Gates did soften his message a bit, noting that, not counting United States forces, NATO troops in Afghanistan were to increase to 50,000 this year, from 30,000 last year.
 ''By any measure,'' he said, ''that is an extraordinary feat.''
 More sobering, he said, was that just two months into the year, NATO was facing shortfalls of hundreds of millions of euros -- ''a natural consequence of having underinvested in collective defense for over a decade.''
 NATO's problems -- greatly magnified by the expansion of its mandate beyond European borders, following 9/11 -- called for ''serious, far-reaching and immediate reforms,'' Mr. Gates said.
 Indeed, the secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, last month turned to an unlikely source -- Russia -- to request helicopters for use in Afghanistan, arguing that this would help reduce the terrorism threat and drug trade on a border of the former Soviet Union. 
 Mr. Rasmussen, speaking at the same meeting as Mr. Gates, said that NATO's members needed to better coordinate their weapons purchases. The European Union and NATO should collaborate on developing capabilities like heavy-lift helicopters, he said, and avoid ''spending double money.''

HEADLINE: Questions Surface After Haitian Airlift

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON; Simon Romero contributed reporting from Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
It was widely billed as the first uplifting story in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated Haiti's capital: two young American women rescued 54 Haitian orphans in an airlift organized by Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania and supported by top Obama administration officials.
 More than a month later, Governor Rendell is enjoying a reprieve from months of negative budget news coverage, the local church that sponsors the American women's work with orphans is reportedly receiving record donations and 42 of the orphans are in the care of American families who had applied to adopt them. 
 But for 12 of the children, last month's airlift transported them from one uncertain predicament to another. As it turns out, those children -- between 11 months and 10 years old -- were not in the process of being adopted, might not all even be orphans and are living in a juvenile care center here while the authorities determine whether they have relatives in Haiti who are able to take care of them.
 The details of the children's departure -- and what that could mean for relations between the United States and the Haitian government, which later detained 10 Americans for trying to take children out of the country without authorization -- remain unclear. 
 Ambassador Raymond Joseph, Haiti's envoy to the United States, said he refused to approve Governor Rendell's request to remove children from the country who were not already in the adoption pipeline. But an aide to Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said the Haitian government accepted assurances from Mr. Rendell and American officials that the children would be well cared for in the United States. The adviser, Alice Blanchet, said of the governor, ''I have no reason to second guess his intentions.'' 
 Senior Obama administration officials acknowledged in interviews that the lines of authority were fuzzy in Haiti on the day of the rescue mission, Jan. 18. And they said that American officials concerned about the well-being of the children had allowed Mr. Rendell to remove them from Haiti even though they had not received clear authorization to travel by the Haitian government and were not in the process of being adopted by American families, as required by a United States humanitarian parole policy announced the day Mr. Rendell landed in Haiti.
 ''This wasn't supposed to happen this way,'' said one senior State Department official, who like others asked not to be identified in order to speak candidly about the episode. ''But it's not as if it was a normal day in Haiti, either.''
 When asked what he had done to persuade the administration to grant an exception for the 12 children, Mr. Rendell said in a phone interview, ''I don't know how it happened, but I didn't ask a lot of questions, and if you had seen the faces of those children as we loaded them onto the airplane, you wouldn't have asked a lot of questions, either.''
 Several administration officials who spoke at length about the rescue effort suggested that they were led by their hearts. There were two American women and 54 small children living in precarious conditions without reliable access to food, water and sanitation. Telephone lines were down. And nearly all government offices had been flattened.
 Matt Chandler, a spokesman at the Department of Homeland Security, said: ''This was an extraordinary situation. There wasn't the benefit of time. And there was a gut decision that the administration believed was in the best interests of the children.''
 Child-protection advocates, who generally believe that hastily removing unaccompanied children from areas hit by disasters risks severing family bonds and exposing the children to further trauma, took a different view. 
 Diane Paul, an expert on natural disasters and human rights at the Brookings Institution, pointed out that most children living in Haitian orphanages had families who gave them up during hard economic times, but ultimately hoped to recover them. ''How do we know someone in Haiti is not looking for them?'' she asked, referring to the 12 children.
 For now, they are living in a sweeping 5,000-square-foot cottage at the Holy Family Institute just outside Pittsburgh. The institute's snow-covered playground and indoor swimming pool make it seem a world away from the squalid streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. The director, Linda Yankoski, said leaders of Pittsburgh's small Haitian community were volunteering to cook for and work with the children. And she said the children did not seem traumatized by their transition.
 In coming days, officials said, Red Cross workers plan to interview the children and establish if they have families in Haiti. 
 The Pennsylvania governor, a Democrat, said he got involved with the rescue effort after learning about two Pittsburgh-area women -- Jamie and Ali McMutrie -- who were caring for dozens of children outside a Port-au-Prince orphanage that had been damaged in the earthquake.
 From their camp amid the rubble, the young and telegenic McMutrie sisters started a campaign on Facebook and Twitter that captured the attention of people across Pennsylvania. Their pleas for help became part of a national outcry by families seeking to adopt Haitian children that led the Obama administration to take the unusual step of offering humanitarian parole to hundreds of orphans.
 Most of the 54 children in the McMutrie sisters' care were eligible for parole, the authorities said. But the women refused to leave Haiti without the dozen children who were not.
 That is where Mr. Rendell's high-level political connections became most important. Upon landing at the Port-au-Prince airport, he said, he used a cellphone and a BlackBerry that faded in and out of service to press for authorization to take all the children to the United States.
 He and Representative Jason Altmire, another Democrat who was also participating in the mission, began contacting everyone they thought could help back in Washington, including Rahm Emanuel, President Obama's chief of staff, Huma M. Abedin, a senior aide to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Pennsylvania's two senators, Arlen Specter and Bob Casey, both Democrats.
 Denis McDonough, the president's deputy national security adviser, who happened to be at the Port-au-Prince airport trying to fly home that day, was also enlisted to help.
 Mr. Altmire recalled getting one or two more children approved with nearly every phone call. Mr. McDonough got a message on his BlackBerry granting the children authority to come to the United States. And five and a half emotionally exhilarating hours later, most of the group was on its way to Pittsburgh.
 One little girl, named Emma, had gotten left behind in the shuffle and was brought to Pittsburgh the next day.
 Since then, Mr. Altmire said, no one involved with the effort had looked back. He recalled one little boy who clutched a photo of his adoptive parents.
 ''That put the whole thing in perspective for me,'' Mr. Altmire said. ''I knew all our efforts were worth it.''

HEADLINE: Fearful the U.S. Is Slipping, a $3.5 Billion Effort Aims to Help Tech Start-Ups

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Technologists have been worrying aloud for years that America is losing its competitive edge as other countries invest more heavily in technology education and innovation. 
 To counter that trend, Intel and 24 venture capital firms said Tuesday that they planned to invest $3.5 billion in American start-ups over the next two years.
 In addition, Intel, Google, Cisco Systems, Microsoft and 13 other employers pledged to add jobs in 2010 -- specifically by hiring 10,500 graduates of American colleges, largely those with computer science and engineering degrees. 
 The initiative, called the Invest in America Alliance, is spearheaded by Intel, the world's largest chip maker, and was announced on Tuesday by the company's chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
 ''Unfortunately, long-term investments in education, research, digital technology and human capital have been steadily declining in the U.S.,'' Mr. Otellini said, according to a transcript of the speech. ''So, too, has the commitment to policies that made us such an entrepreneurial powerhouse for more than a century.'' 
 Other countries, including China, India, Taiwan, Finland, Korea and the Netherlands, have become ''far more potent competitors in the next phase of the global economy,'' he said. 
 As part of the alliance, two dozen venture capital firms -- including top-tier names like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Venrock and DCM -- have committed to investing portions of their funds in start-ups founded in the United States. Intel Capital, the company's venture capital arm, will invest $200 million. 
 The United States is quickly losing ground to China and India, said Robert Compton, a venture capitalist and entrepreneur who produced a documentary on education in the three countries. 
 Fewer than 10 percent of college graduates in the United States have engineering degrees, compared with more than one-third in India and China, and more foreign-born graduates of United States universities are returning to their home countries, he said. 
 ''Early indicators are that we are not the center of innovation anymore,'' Mr. Compton said. ''It is shifting to the East.'' 
 Another indicator of the shift is patent filings, which increased 30 percent in China last year while declining 11 percent in the United States, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. 
 But some analysts say they doubt that more venture capital for American start-ups is the solution. 
 ''If they were really serious about it, they would be fixing visa systems so foreign students would stay here,'' said Vivek Wadhwa, an executive-in-residence at Duke University, where he researches the impact of globalization on engineering and the competitive advantage of the United States. 
 And others say that the competitive threat from abroad is overblown. The United States benefits no matter where new technologies are invented, because Americans are more innovative at using and commercializing technologies, said Amar Bhide, a visiting professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who expands on that argument in his book, ''The Venturesome Economy.'' 
 ''The World Wide Web was invented in Switzerland, and I think we have taken far greater advantage of that than Switzerland,'' he said. 
 Whether or not American innovation is under siege, it is unclear how much of a difference Intel's initiative will make. Hiring 10,500 people will make only a small dent in the nation's unemployment rolls. And most of the venture firms are not raising new funds to invest in start-ups, but committing money that would most likely have gone to American start-ups anyway. 
 Venture capital firms based in the United States already invest 70 percent of their money in start-ups in this country, while Chinese and Indian companies each receive just 3 percent, according to the National Venture Capital Association. 
 ''We're not changing our behavior,'' said Dixon Doll, co-founder of DCM, which has committed $200 million to the alliance. ''We're all just saying this is something we can get behind for the good of the country.'' 
 The announcement from Mr. Otellini comes as both Intel and its venture capital arm could use a public relations lift. The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust complaint against Intel. Rajiv Goel, a former managing director at Intel who worked closely with Intel Capital, has admitted to leaking confidential corporate information in the Galleon insider-trading case.

HEADLINE: ABC News Plans to Trim 300 to 400 From Staff

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER and BILL CARTER

 BODY:
ABC News will sharply reduce its news-gathering staff through buyouts and possible layoffs, the company said on Tuesday. ABC employees said they expected the cutbacks would affect 300 to 400 people, or roughly 25 percent of the news division's work force.
 The cuts at ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, are among the steepest ever made at a network news division. A spokesman said ABC News currently employed roughly 1,500 people. 
 In a memorandum to staff members, the ABC News president David Westin called the cutbacks a ''fundamental transformation'' for the division that would result in a leaner, smaller organization. ''The time has come to rethink how we do what we are doing,'' he wrote. 
 Mr. Westin said in an interview on Tuesday that the reductions were an effort to get ahead of economic pressures squeezing the broadcast business.
 ''These are forces larger than any of us -- business forces, just the realities of broadcast versus digital, as well as financial forces, given the advertising market,'' Mr. Westin said.
 For decades, the network news divisions have suffered audience erosion, the result of competition from cable, the Internet and changing consumer habits. Under pressure from their parent companies, they have endured rounds of smaller cuts over the years. One of ABC's chief competitors, CBS News, said this month that it was laying off dozens of employees. 
 Some ABC News staff members, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized by the network to speak to other outlets, said they believed that Mr. Westin had been compelled to act by Disney management. Mr. Westin cast the moves as part of a long-term adjustment to protect against an uncertain future. ''It's better for the organization if we embrace change rather than get dragged into it,'' he said.
 Mr. Westin said the news division was not in extreme economic duress. 
 ''ABC News has always kept its head above water, even in really bad times,'' he said. ''But as I looked out over the next several years I could not in good conscience say that things are going to get better and there's going to be a big turnaround in broadcast revenue. As a result I concluded we needed to move now.''
 He would not comment on reports that the goal was a 20 percent cost reduction across the board at ABC News. 
 Inside the news division, an announcement about cost reductions had been anticipated for weeks, causing what one employee called a ''dark cloud.'' 
 ''It's been very gloomy here for a while now,'' said the employee. ''But everyone sees the reality of the industry, and everyone wants to stay competitive.'' 
 ABC plans to combine its weekday and weekend staffs of ''Good Morning America'' and ''World News,'' and rely more heavily on freelancers for newsmagazines like ''20/20.'' The network will also further reduce its news bureau structure by replacing some bureaus with more flexible so-called digital journalists who work on their own in foreign capitals.
 Furthermore, it will expect more staff members to produce, record and edit much of their own material. Mr. Westin added in the memo, however, that traditional crews will still handle most of the network's news gathering. 
 ''Over all, we will eliminate redundancies wherever possible,'' Mr. Westin said in the memo.
 He left no doubt that though the network would seek ways to save through the use of digital equipment, the main impact of the cost reductions in the division will fall on employees.
 ''The majority of our costs are in personnel,'' Mr. Westin said, adding that he did not intend to minimize the impact the cuts would have. ''Many of these people are respected colleagues.''
 Layoffs will depend on the number of people who volunteer for buyouts in the next 30 days. Mr. Westin said he expected the process to take roughly 60 days.
 Asked about the impact of the cutbacks on ABC's programs, Mr. Westin said, ''I frankly don't think it will be particularly noticeable for viewers.''Jason Samuels, an associate professor of journalism at New York University and a former senior producer at ABC, said Tuesday's move ''makes sense,'' but added, ''ultimately the pressure to continue churning out network quality news with a pared-down staff is a recipe for burnout.''

HEADLINE: Albany Erred by Tying Up Judges' Raises, Court Rules

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
ALBANY -- New York's highest court ruled on Tuesday that governors and legislators had violated the State Constitution by trying to tie pay raises for state judges to unrelated legislation, including bills to raise lawmakers' own salaries.
 In a 5-to-1 decision, the Court of Appeals found that by refusing to consider a judicial pay raise on its own merits, the legislative and executive branches had created a ''judicial pay crisis,'' undermining the independence of the judicial branch and violating the separation of powers doctrine. 
 ''The state defendants assert that it is within their legislative rights to consider judicial compensation not on the merits but relative to unrelated policy initiatives,'' the court said in its decision, written by Judge Eugene F. Pigott Jr.
 ''But they overlook the fact that they are treating judicial compensation, which falls within the scope of their constitutional duties, as if it were merely another government program appropriation as opposed to compensation for members of a co-equal branch.''
 The ruling, which addresses three separate lawsuits filed by current and former state judges, stops short of ordering the Legislature to grant a pay raise to judges, though the opinion did leave open the possibility that the court may attempt to do so in the future.
 ''We do not believe that it is necessary here to order specific injunctive relief,'' Judge Pigott wrote. ''When this court articulates the constitutional standards governing state action, we presume that the state will act accordingly.''
 In a dissenting opinion, Judge Robert S. Smith argued that the salary logjam had not yet created a crisis for the court system or deprived it of able judges. The court's chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, recused himself from deliberations because he was a plaintiff in one of the cases that the ruling addresses. The court's judges themselves would be entitled to any pay raise that lawmakers adopted. 
 In a video message on Tuesday to judges of the state court system, Judge Lippman said that while the decision did not order a specific salary increase for judges or even lay out a precise time frame for the Legislature to act, lawmakers were under an obligation to act ''in good faith and expeditiously'' to resolve the conflict.
 ''I am calling upon the other branches, publicly and privately,'' he said, ''to comply with the court's decision and honor their constitutional obligations and the respective functions of the different branches of government.'' 
 But legislative leaders -- and the governor -- appeared in no hurry to act. 
 Morgan Hook, a spokesman for Gov. David A. Paterson, said that the governor believed judges had gone too long without raises and that it had ''the potential to do great harm to our very accomplished judicial branch.''
 ''Governor Paterson is once again urging the Legislature to enact his proposal to establish a Quadrennial Commission that periodically would review and adjust judicial compensation and make a recommendation to the Legislature to be determined on a nay or yea basis without linkage to any extraneous notions,'' Mr. Hook said. ''The judiciary deserves such a straightforward analytical approach.''
 But, he added, ''a full pay raise at this time would be a large burden as we try and close a $8.2 billion deficit.''
 In a statement, Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, said that while he believed that judicial salaries should be raised, the Assembly would consider doing so only ''when economic conditions improve.''
 John L. Sampson, the Democratic conference leader in the State Senate, echoed that comment. ''Encouraging our best and brightest to become and remain judges in New York is essential to protecting the peoples' right to a sound system of justice,'' Mr. Sampson said in a statement. ''However, during the worst fiscal crisis in decades, it is difficult to justify pay raises for anyone in public service.''
 The ruling by the Court of Appeals follows years of steadily rising caseloads for the state's 1,300 judges, whose salaries cannot be reduced while they are on the bench but cannot be raised without an act of the Legislature.
 Judges' pay was last raised in 1998. Currently, salaries range from $156,000, the annual pay of the Court of Appeals' chief judge, to $5,800, the amount earned for some part-time state judges in cities like Albany, Buffalo and Yonkers. 
 Since then, the court found, inflation has drained as much as one-third of the value of judges' salaries. During the same period, the court found, the judges' workload had risen to 4.5 million cases each year, from 3.5 million. 
 Twice in recent years, once under former Gov. George E. Pataki and once under Mr. Paterson, the state budget has included a so-called dry appropriation for judicial pay raises, setting aside money but preventing it from being spent without further legislative authorization.
 That authorization never arrived, as legislative pay raises became a classic Albany political football. 
 For its part, the Legislature has refused to pass legislation increasing judges' salaries unless it will also increase lawmakers' salaries. Members of the Assembly and Senate currently earn a base salary of $79,500, though many earn tens of thousands of dollars more in leadership bonuses known as lulus. Unlike all but the part-time judges, moreover, lawmakers can and usually do hold outside employment.
 Governors have played the game, too. When the Senate passed a bill in 2007 that would have created a commission to review salary increases for both the Legislature and the judicial branch, the governor at the time, Eliot Spitzer, refused to agree to a deal unless the bill included ethics and campaign finance measures.

HEADLINE: Health Care: Toward the Big Day

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Up Next! On Live TV! Battle Over ...Health?'' (news article, Feb. 21):
 Bipartisanship is a misunderstood concept. It's a utopian idea. At best utopian ideas are empty, and at worst they lead to a sacrifice of common sense, and sometimes more dangerous sacrifice.
 Democracy is about majority rule and minority rights, not minority right to rule. Why bother having elections if everyone has to agree? Partisanship is how our democracy works. Ideas are presented and debated, programs are presented, candidates represent a position, and we vote. 
 Of course there's nothing wrong with compromise to move things ahead, and partisanship does not include breaking the rules to get things done. But it's a mistake for the Democrats to insist on being bipartisan in the current atmosphere. 
 The public pays lip service to bipartisanship, but not as an end in itself. It wants things done. And the public won't remember how many Republicans voted yes if the program put in place is a good one. 
 Democrats who think that they have to soften toward the middle are playing into the hands of the right. Now is the time to be tough, to be partisan. 
 Roy Tedoff Hortonville, N.Y., Feb. 21, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Republicans say we cannot afford to expand health care in the current economy, whereas Democrats argue that our health care system is actually worsening our economic problems. Great leaders do not unify and advance us by winning intellectual debates like this, however, but rather by calling for shared sacrifice for the achievement of vision.
 On Thursday, President Obama has to do more than call Congressional leaders to find ''common ground'' by acknowledging points of Republican merit and Democratic flexibility. To regain the trust and support of the American people, he must have the courage to do what he and other leaders have avoided thus far, which is to get beyond systems talk and its implication that we can change for free, and call on us to get in shape physically and economically and admit and engage the sacrifices that this requires.
 Chris Wuthmann San Carlos, Calif., Feb. 21, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''How the G.O.P. Can Fix Health Care'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 22): 
 It is obvious that the coming televised meeting of President Obama and the Republican entourage will at most be another evening of entertainment. 
 Having read the ''fixes'' that the Op-Ed contributors offered, I find it almost laughable to read their dialogue of ''how to.''
 Free enterprise, the primary platform of their arguments, is the primary reason we are in the fix we are in. Republicans tout the competition that will flow from well-run insurance companies, conservative medical institutions and nongreedy doctors. Regulatory bodies will monitor this utopian medical world. Need one say more? 
 The only way to resolve our health care dilemma is to take the primary motive of profit out of the equation as most of the first world -- Europe, Canada and elsewhere -- has done. The public option, an alternative supplied by a government of, by and for the people, is the only answer and would offer us a truly competitive choice.
 Rod Latta Guilford, Conn., Feb. 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 How refreshing to read the thoughts of Republicans on reforming health care. If President Obama and Democrats had been open to these ideas earlier, we might have seen proposals more acceptable to many Americans and been further along in the reform process today.
 Instead, the Democrats have been the party of ''no thanks,'' currying deals with some stakeholders while in effect ignoring others. As mentioned elsewhere in The Times on Feb. 22, even governors have been excluded from health care reform deliberations. 
 Too many stakeholders, including the many Americans who are happy with their health care or who oppose bigger government, have been ignored. It's hard to understand how Democrats and a president who campaigned on openness could be so blind to so many.
 Andrea Economos Scarsdale, N.Y., Feb. 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 How are liability protection, increased competition and Medicare reforms going to get health insurance for my sister, who had breast cancer two years ago? 
 Right now, the insurance companies are competing to see who can deny her coverage the fastest.
 Gwenn Jensen Centennial, Colo., Feb. 22, 2010
 To the Editor: 
 Re ''Into the Mire,'' by David Brooks (column, Feb. 23):
 Mr. Brooks avoids the ugly truth when he cites public opinion turning against health care reform. He doesn't mention that Republican lies about ''death panels,'' among other fictions, were the major reason opinions changed. 
 The facts are these: Republicans have opposed every significant reform effort for the last 70 years, including Franklin D. Roosevelt's efforts to get us out of the Depression and Lyndon B. Johnson's signature achievement, Medicare. 
 Medicare is a hugely successful program with low administrative costs, around 3 percent. Americans of every political stripe enjoy its benefits, including Republicans. These same Republicans now oppose other advancements in health care reform, using excuses like ''it costs too much.'' 
 No doubt the children of these Republicans will reap the benefits of current reform, just as my father, a conservative Republican who opposed Medicare, enjoys his Medicare benefits today.
 Cynthia Glenn Seattle, Feb. 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''I Cost More, but I'm a Specialist,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Feb. 21):
 Mr. Kristof made me laugh today. This rarely happens when I read about health care. Attacking the system from an angry perspective hasn't worked to get real reform; maybe humor will. 
 I particularly responded to the comments about the insurance company strategy of putting customers on hold for long periods to discourage them from making an appeal. As a primary-care physician, I have endured this treatment. 
 The American people still don't understand that our system is highly flawed and that neither party in Congress is apt to fix it.

HEADLINE: Democrats Seek to Push Ahead $15 Billion Jobs Bill, With More Steps to Come

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senior Democrats say the House is preparing to quickly pass a $15 billion job-creating measure once it is approved by the Senate, illustrating new urgency on the part of Democrats to show they are taking steps to improve the national employment picture.
 Though House Democrats late last year passed a more sweeping $154 billion jobs and economic recovery package, senior aides and top lawmakers said the House was eager to send President Obama the Senate measure -- perhaps by the end of the week -- to secure an immediate victory on jobs. Democrats would then try to pass other initiatives intended to produce new employment opportunities. 
 ''We need to get a jobs bill on the president's desk ASAP,'' said one top Democratic aide, who was granted anonymity to discuss party strategy.
 Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, was not ready on Tuesday to make a firm commitment about the Senate proposal, particularly since the Senate had not yet completed its consideration of the measure and not all Democratic leaders had given their consent to embracing it. But he acknowledged that speedy consideration was a realistic option.
 The push behind the relatively modest package of tax breaks for employers who hire the unemployed and aid for public works projects is a sign that, even as Democrats continue to press for a broad health care overhaul, they are also working to notch more incremental accomplishments as they try to build a record for the November elections.
 ''We have a jobs agenda, not a jobs bill,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said. ''We're going to have more votes, and create more jobs.''
 After a year in which the health care legislation consumed much of the attention of Congress, Democrats are trying to pivot to make clear that lagging employment is now their primary concern. Mr. Hoyer, in a meeting with reporters, repeatedly pointed out that while health care legislation was important, employment issues would take top priority.
 ''We want to focus on jobs,'' Mr. Hoyer said. 
 Mr. Reid said he intended to follow up the initial legislation with a measure to promote travel, which he said would create a significant number of tourism and service industry jobs and benefit his home state. He said a subsequent jobs-related bill would emphasize help for small businesses, an approach that has bipartisan support in the Senate as well.
 Democrats also intend to push ahead with extensions of unemployment benefits and health coverage for the jobless, programs that are due to expire at the end of the month. Lawmakers also expect to extend corporate tax breaks that were jettisoned from an earlier bipartisan jobs measure.
 The current Senate jobs proposal developed by Mr. Reid was advanced Monday night when five Republicans joined Democrats in shutting off the threat of a filibuster, clearing the way for its expected approval on Wednesday. The Republicans' decision to side with Democrats provided at least a temporary respite from the sharp partisanship that has plagued the Senate over the past year.
 The first Republican to cross party lines on the jobs vote was Senator Scott Brown, the newly elected senator from Massachusetts whose victory ended the 60-vote Democratic majority in the Senate. Republicans had hailed Mr. Brown's election as a turning point that would allow them to sustain filibusters even against a united Democratic majority. 
 Instead, in one of his first votes, Mr. Brown helped Democrats overcome a potential Republican filibuster, a decision that attracted criticism from conservatives who only a few weeks ago were celebrating his campaign and election. 
 But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on Tuesday that he was not disappointed by Mr. Brown's action.
 ''The Republican Party represents all parts of the country, different points of view,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''We don't expect our members to be in lock step on every single issue, and we're happy to have him here.
 ''I think it's made a huge, positive difference for us and for the whole legislative agenda.''

HEADLINE: Home Improvement Retailers See Glints of Rebound

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
After more than a year of not spending money on their homes, consumers began refurbishing their kitchens and painting their living rooms in what appears to be the early stages of a comeback for the home improvement industry. 
 Home Depot and Lowe's, the nation's largest home improvement retailers, posted better-than-expected earnings this week. They said that they did not have to turn to discounts as much as they did last year, and that some customers splurged on higher-priced goods and services like carpet installations. 
 Of Home Depot's top 40 markets in the United States, all but two showed year-over-year improvement in the most recent reporting period. Some markets in California and Florida, among the states hit hard by the recession, even had sales growth at stores open at least a year, a barometer of retail health. 
 Frank Blake, the company's chairman and chief executive, said during a conference call on Tuesday that there was ''cause for optimism in 2010,'' though he described it as a transitional year, not a year of robust growth. 
 ''Calling the year 'transitional' doesn't sound very exciting,'' Mr. Blake said, ''but we have been waiting for this transition for a long time.''
 For the three months that ended Jan. 31, Home Depot had a profit of $342 million, or 20 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $54 million, or 3 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 0.3 percent, to $14.6 billion, which executives attributed to store closings. Sales at stores open at least a year were up 1.2 percent -- the first increase in years. Also, Home Depot increased its quarterly dividend for the first time since 2006. 
 On Monday, Lowe's posted a profit of $205 million for the three months that ended Jan. 29, or 14 cents a share, compared with $162 million, or 11 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales increased 1.8 percent, to $10.2 billion. Same-store sales declined 1.6 percent, but that was still the best performance in more than three years.
 Robert A. Niblock, the chairman and chief executive of Lowe's, said during a conference call that the results suggested ''that the worst of the economic cycle is likely behind us.'' 
 Yet while consumers appear to be taking on more discretionary home improvement projects, retailers are still under pressure. 
 Mr. Blake underscored that the housing industry remained stressed, mortgage defaults continued to increase and unemployment was high. Mr. Niblock of Lowe's noted that the industry was still contending with ''the psychological impact of consumers wondering when home prices will finally bottom.''
 Indeed, Home Depot's professional business -- merchandise typically bought by builders and contractors -- was weak, though the rate of decline was not as bad as in previous months. The company's worst-performing categories included lumber, hardware, electrical goods and other high-priced construction-related categories. Lowe's, too, said sales to its commercial business customers were soft.
 Both Home Depot and Lowe's said that the average amount spent at their cash registers declined from figures in the period a year earlier, though that was not exactly bad news. 
 ''It's still down, but down a lot less,'' Carol Tome, Home Depot's chief financial officer, said in an interview on Tuesday. ''We were very pleased with that.'' 
 Sales in Home Depot's most recent reporting period were driven by the kitchen and bath, paint, flooring and plumbing categories as well as its international businesses. Sales in maintenance and do-it-yourself repair categories continued to be strong. So were simple decor-related categories like ceramic tile, carpet, paint, faucets and bath fixtures.
 Transactions of $900 or more, which represent about 20 percent of Home Depot's sales in the United States, declined less than 1 percent. As Craig Menear, Home Depot's executive vice president for merchandising, put it: that is ''a significant improvement compared to double-digit declines in previous quarters in 2009.'' He attributed the improvement to consumers snapping up values in Home Depot's appliances, water heaters and windows categories. 
 Lowe's said sales of flooring, cabinets and countertops were strong, a sign that consumers were willing to take on more costly projects. 
 Both companies said their results were also helped by cost cuts. 
 Analysts who study the home improvement industry predict a slow recovery. Mike Baker, a research analyst with Deutsche Bank, noted in a research report that the biggest threat to the sector's recovery ''is another leg down in housing, particularly as government stimulus factors dissipate.'' 
 Both Home Depot and Lowe's predicted business would pick up toward the end of the year. For 2010, Home Depot expects earnings of $1.79 a share, and a same-store sales increase of 2.5 percent. Lowe's said that for the year it expects earnings of $1.30 to $1.42 a share, and a same-store increase of 1 to 3 percent.
 Shares of Home Depot rose 43 cents on Tuesday, to $30.75; Lowe's fell 26 cents, to $22.81.

HEADLINE: States Lag In Meeting Weatherizing Goals So Far

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and LESLIE KAUFMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's plan to create jobs and rein in energy costs through a steep increase in money for weatherizing the homes of low-income Americans has so far borne little fruit, with many of the biggest states meeting less than 2 percent of their three-year goals to date, the Department of Energy's inspector general said in a reportTuesday.
 The inspector general, Gregory H. Friedman, called the lack of progress ''alarming.'' Far into the nation's winter heating season, the program for the most part has neither saved energy nor put people to work, Mr. Friedman wrote. 
 ''The job creation impact of what was considered to be one of the department's most 'shovel ready' projects has not materialized,'' the report said.
 The assessment, issued a year after the weatherization program was created under the fiscal Recovery Act, comes as Congress moves toward passing a second bill to stimulate employment. Republicans and Democrats have been arguing over whether that second bill will add enough jobs in time to help revive the economy. 
 Responding to the report, Cathy Zoi, the Energy Department's assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy, acknowledged Tuesday that the weatherization program could have gotten off to a faster start but said that it was gaining momentum quickly. 
 ''Since September 2009, we have tripled the pace of Recovery Act-funded home weatherization,'' Ms. Zoi said in a statement. 
 She added that the department was bolstering federal oversight of the program to ensure that the states continued to strengthen their efforts. 
 Most of the weatherization projects involve improving insulation and replacing leaky windows and doors in the homes of low-income residents.
 Under the 2009 Recovery Act, $5 billion was allotted for weatherproofing apartments and houses over three years, up from $450 million in the previous fiscal year. States were authorized to spend up to 50 percent of the money they received by the end of December, the report said. 
 Yet the report said action was hobbled by bureaucratic delays and by the recession itself, as spending cuts resulting from the economic downturn forced states to trim personnel expenses.
 Many states either furloughed the state employees who would administer such programs or instituted hiring freezes that prevented state offices from processing additional work -- even though the federal government would have paid the additional salaries, the report found. 
 Another stumbling block was a decision by Congress to require contractors on the weatherization jobs to pay prevailing wages, the report said. To determine what those salary levels were, the Labor Department undertook a survey. 
 In the meantime, the Energy Department instructed states to go ahead and put people to work and to keep records so the federal government could make retroactive payments if necessary. But most states did not begin hiring until the wage question was resolved last fall, the report said. 
 As a result, as of mid-February, one year into the stimulus plan, less than 8 percent of the money had been disbursed, the inspector general said. 
 The pace of actual weatherizations was also dismal, the report said. New York State, for example, had a goal of weatherizing 45,400 units over three years, but by December had finished only 280, a completion rate of 0.62 percent, the report found. One reason, it said, was a hiring freeze in New York City. 
 Progress in Pennsylvania, which weatherized 1.28 percent of the houses and apartments it had intended to, was slowed by a deadlock over the state budget, the report said. Illinois wanted to hire 21 workers to oversee work on nearly 27,000 homes; it hired none because of a spending freeze, and completed only 331 homes, or 1.23 percent of its three-year target. 
 But some state officials said that the numbers did not reflect current progress. 
 Gordon Anderson, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, which administers the weatherization program there, said that as of Tuesday, the state had carried out 1,057 weatherizations under the federal program and that it expected another 459 to be completed by the end of next week. 
 Mr. Anderson cited logistical complications for the slow start-up.
 ''We went from a budget of $13 million for weatherizations to $327 million,'' he said, ''so we needed to get a serious plan in place to assure that our agency and all our contractors had the inadequate capacity to administer the funds.''
 Officials in other states also emphasized that the program required some time to put in place properly. Many said the number of houses they were weatherizing with the recovery money was now rising sharply. 
 Jim Plastiras, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said that action had been delayed by the confusion over wages, which was not resolved until October, but that efforts were now gathering steam. The state now has 17,400 homes in progress, Mr. Plastiras said. 
 The government commissioned the inspector general's report to ensure that forceful safeguards were in place to ensure that the $5 billion achieved its purpose of creating jobs, improving the quality of life in low-income households and reducing the waste of energy.

HEADLINE: Regional Group Leaves Out U.S. and Canada

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
Leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean agreed Tuesday to form a new regional group that brings Cuba into the fold but excludes Canada and the United States. 
 Some of the divisions within the group were on full display during the two-day meeting on Mexico's Caribbean coast, and most of the details of the new bloc -- including its name -- remain to be worked out. 
 But by creating the new group, President Felipe Calderon of Mexico could claim a diplomatic success. ''We will strengthen our voice in the concert of nations through this new mechanism, to become protagonists and no longer mere spectators of what happens in the world,'' Mr. Calderon said as the meeting of 32 heads of state closed.
 All of the invited leaders attended, including President Raul Castro of Cuba. His appearance appeared to mark an end to more than a decade of strained relations between Mexico and Cuba. 
 The gathering also highlighted how diverse the region's politics have become, divided among a populist left-wing bloc led by President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, center-left leaders like President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil and conservative leaders, including Mr. Calderon and Sebastian Pinera, who will take office as Chile's president next month. 
 Some of the leaders, including Mr. Chavez, would like the new bloc to supplant the Organization of American States, which they and other critics say is dominated by the United States. But Mr. Calderon said Tuesday that Mexico would continue to participate in the O.A.S. Mexican officials have said that the new bloc would streamline the work of a patchwork of regional groups, particularly on issues like poverty and economic development. 
 Another aim of the meeting was to create a way to prevent local tensions from flaring up into more serious regional conflicts. 
 Those tensions were on full display on Monday, when an argument flared between Mr. Chavez and President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia, who have been at odds for years over Mr. Uribe's close relationship with the United States. 
 Mr. Chavez accused Mr. Uribe of tolerating paramilitary groups who threatened Venezuela and he prepared to storm out, witnesses told reporters. 
 But Mr. Uribe was said to have shouted: ''Be a man, stay here, because sometimes you insult from a distance, but when we're face to face, we don't talk.'' Mr. Calderon and Mr. Castro intervened to calm both men down. 
 In response, the leaders designated Mr. Calderon, Mr. da Silva and President Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Republic as a ''group of friends'' to mediate between Colombia and Venezuela. 
 Declarations at the end of the meeting repeated some longtime grievances, including one that called for an end to the United States' trade embargo against Cuba.

HEADLINE: Extending Our Stay in Iraq

BYLINE: By THOMAS E. RICKS

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 IRAQ'S March 7 national election, and the formation of a new government that will follow, carry huge implications for both Iraqis and American policy. It appears now that the results are unlikely to resolve key political struggles that could return the country to sectarianism and violence.
 If so, President Obama may find himself later this year considering whether once again to break his campaign promises about ending the war, and to offer to keep tens of thousands of troops in Iraq for several more years. Surprisingly, that probably is the best course for him, and for Iraqi leaders, to pursue. 
 Whether or not the elections bring the long-awaited political breakthrough that genuinely ends the fighting there, 2010 is likely to be a turning-point year in the war, akin to the summer of 2003 (when the United States realized that it faced an insurgency) and 2006 (when that insurgency morphed into a small but vicious civil war and American policy came to a dead end). For good or ill, this is likely the year we will begin to see the broad outlines of post-occupation Iraq. The early signs are not good, with the latest being the decision over the weekend of the leading Sunni party, the National Dialogue Front, to withdraw from the elections. 
 The political situation is far less certain, and I think less stable, than most Americans believe. A retired Marine colonel I know, Gary Anderson, just returned from Iraq and predicts a civil war or military coup by September. Another friend, the journalist Nir Rosen, avers that Iraq is on a long-term peaceful course. Both men know Iraq well, having spent years working there. I have not seen such a wide discrepancy in expert views since late 2005. 
 The period surrounding the surge of 2007 has been misremembered. It was not about simply sending 30,000 more troops to Iraq; it was about using force differently, moving the troops off big bases to work with Iraqi units and live among the people. Perhaps even more significantly, the surge signaled a change in American attitudes, with more humility about what could be done, more willingness to listen to Iraqis, and with quietly but sharply reduced ambitions. 
 The Bush administration's grandiose original vision of transforming Iraq into a beacon of democracy that would alter the Middle East and drain the swamps of terrorism was scuttled and replaced by the more realistic goal of getting American forces out and leaving behind a country that was somewhat stable and, with luck, perhaps democratic and respectful of human rights. As part of the shift, the American commander, Gen. David Petraeus, also effectively put the Sunni insurgency on the American payroll. 
 Looking back now, I think the surge was the right thing to do. In rejecting the view of the majority of his military advisers and embracing the course proposed by a handful of dissidents, President Bush found his finest moment. That said, the larger goal of the surge was to facilitate a political breakthrough, which has not happened. 
 All the existential questions that plagued Iraq before the surge remain unanswered. How will oil revenue be shared among the country's major groups? What is to be the fundamental relationship between Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds? Will Iraq have a strong central government or be a loose confederation? And what will be the role of Iran (for my money, the biggest winner in the Iraq war thus far)? 
 Unfortunately, all of these questions have led to violence in the past, and could again just as the Obama administration's timeline calls for troops to leave areas that are far from quiet. The plan this year is to pull out about 10,000 troops a month for five months, beginning in late spring. That will halve the American military presence, with the remainder (other than a ''residual force'' of unspecified size) scheduled to be withdrawn in 2011. The withdrawal plan was written on the assumption that the elections would be held late in 2009 or early in 2010. Under the plan, troop numbers would be kept level to ensure stability in a vulnerable period, especially if the Sunnis were to feel that the electoral process was unfair, or if they were not given a role in the new government commensurate with their success at the polls. 
 But given the changed timetable, just as Iraqi political leaders are struggling to form a new government, American military leaders will be distracted by the myriad tasks of supervising major troop movements. On top of that, the deeper the troop withdrawals go, the more potentially destabilizing they will be -- because the first withdrawals will be made in areas that are considered more secure, or where Iraqi forces are deemed more reliable or evenhanded. 
 By June, American troops may be leaving areas that are far from quiet, and where new tensions may be brewing as a result of the elections. Once again, the United States would be rushing toward failure in Iraq, as it did so often under the Bush administration, trying to pass responsibility to Iraqi officials and institutions before they are ready for the task. 
 By late summer, the Obama administration could find itself in the uncomfortable position of reconsidering its vows to get out of combat in Iraq by August and to remove all troops by the end of next year. This will be politically difficult for the president, but he has shown admirable flexibility in his handling of Iraq. My impression is that the American people now wish they had never heard of Iraq, but understand just what a mess it is and are willing to give the president a surprising amount of leeway. 
 Extending the American military presence will be even more politically controversial in Iraq, and for that reason, it would be best to let Iraqi leaders make the first public move to re-open the status of forces agreement of 2008, which calls for American troops to be out of the country by the end of next year. But I think leaders in both countries may come to recognize that the best way to deter a return to civil war is to find a way to keep 30,000 to 50,000 United States service members in Iraq for many years to come. 
 These troops' missions would be far narrower than during the surge era; their primary goal would be to train and advise Iraqi security forces and to carry out counterterrorism missions. (It is actually hard to get below 30,000 and still have an effective force; many troops are needed for logistics, maintenance, medical, intelligence, communications and headquarters jobs, and additional infantry units are then needed to protect the people performing those tasks.) 
 Such a relatively small, tailored force would not be big enough to wage a war, but it might be enough to deter a new one from breaking out. An Iraqi civil war would likely be a three- or four-sided affair, with the Shiites breaking into pro- and anti-Iranian factions. It could also easily metastasize into a regional war. Neighboring powers like Turkey and Iran are already involved in Iraqi affairs, and the Sunni Arab states would be unlikely to stand by and watch a Shiite-dominated regime in Baghdad slaughter the Sunni minority. A regional war in the middle of the world's oil patch could shake the global economy to its foundations and make the current recession look mild. 
 In addition, a continued American military presence could help Iraq move forward politically. No one there particularly likes having the Americans around, but many groups seem to trust the Americans as honest brokers. And there would be a moral, humanitarian and political benefit: Having American soldiers accompany Iraqi units may improve the behavior of Iraqi forces, discouraging relapses to Saddam Hussein-era abuses, or the use of force for private ends and feuds. Advisers not only instruct Iraqi commanders, they also monitor them. 
 As a longtime critic of the American invasion of Iraq, I am not happy about advocating a continued military presence there. Yet, to echo the counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen, just because you invade a country stupidly doesn't mean you should leave it stupidly. The best argument against keeping troops in Iraq is the one some American military officers make, which is that a civil war is inevitable, and that by staying all we are doing is postponing it. That may be so, but I don't think it is worth gambling to find out.

HEADLINE: Bust the Health Care Trusts

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. REICH

DATELINE: Berkeley, Calif. 

 BODY:
 MY health insurer here in California is Anthem Blue Cross. So far, my group policy hasn't been affected by Anthem's planned rate increase of as much as 39 percent for its customers with individual policies -- but the trend worries me, as it should everyone. Rates are soaring all over the country. Insurers have been seeking to raise premiums 24 percent in Connecticut, 23 percent in Maine, 20 percent in Oregon and a wallet-popping 56 percent in Michigan. How can insurers raise prices as much as they want without fear of losing customers? 
 Astonishingly, the health insurance industry is exempt from federal antitrust laws, which is why a handful of insurers have become so dominant in their markets that their customers simply have nowhere else to go. But that protection could soon end: President Obama on Tuesday announced his support of a House bill that would repeal health insurers' antitrust exemption, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled that she would put it toward an immediate vote. 
 This is promising news. Forcing insurers to compete for our business would do at least as much good as the president's proposal to give the federal government, working with the states, the power to deny or roll back excessive premiums. The fact is that half of the states already have the power to approve rates and they don't seem to be holding insurers back much. 
 Health insurers like Anthem claim they have to raise rates (as well as co-payments and deductibles) because of the economic downturn. Employers are reducing coverage and cutting payrolls. As a result, more people are buying individual policies, but they tend to be older and sicker. Younger and healthier Americans are simply going without insurance, and thus not subsidizing their costlier fellow policy-holders. 
 This can't be the whole story, because big health insurers are making boatloads of money. America's five largest health insurers made a total profit of $12.2 billion last year; that was 56 percent higher than in 2008, according to a report from Health Care for America Now. 
 It's not as if health insurers have been inventing jazzy software or making jet airplanes. Basically, they just collect money from employers and individuals and give the money to providers. In most markets, consumers wouldn't pay this much for so little. We'd find a competitor that charged less and delivered more. What's stopping us? Not enough choice.
 More than 90 percent of insurance markets in more than 300 metropolitan areas are ''highly concentrated,'' as defined by the Federal Trade Commission, according to the American Medical Association. A 2008 survey by the Government Accountability Office found the five largest providers of small group insurance controlled 75 percent or more of the market in 34 states, and 90 percent or more in 23 of those states, a significant increase in concentration since the G.A.O.'s 2002 survey. 
 Anthem's parent is WellPoint, one of the largest publicly traded health insurers in America, which runs Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states and Unicare plans in several others. WellPoint, through Anthem, is the largest for-profit health insurer here in California, as it is in Maine, where it controls 78 percent of the market. In Missouri, WellPoint owns 68 percent of the market; in its home state, Indiana, 60 percent. With 35 million customers, WellPoint counts one out of every nine Americans as a member of one of its plans. 
 Antitrust laws are supposed to prevent this kind of market power. So why are giant health insurers like WellPoint exempt? Chalk it up to an anomaly that began seven decades ago in the quaint old world of regional, nonprofit Blues. They were created in part by hospitals to spread the costs of expensive new equipment and facilities over many policy holders. Collaboration was the point, not competition. The 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act made it official, exempting insurers from antitrust scrutiny and giving states the power to regulate them, although not necessarily any power to regulate rates. 
 The system worked fairly well until about two decades ago when insurers began morphing into publicly held, for-profit cash machines. A new breed of medical entrepreneur saw opportunities to profit from a rapidly aging population eager to get every new drug and technology that might extend their lives, and a government committed to doling out hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare and Medicaid. 
 With size has come not only market power but political clout. Big for-profit insurers deploy enough campaign money and lobbyists to get their way with state legislators and insurance commissioners. A proposal last year to allow California's Department of Insurance to regulate rates, for example, died in committee. These companies have even been known to press states to limit how many other health insurers they license. 
 And when they can't get their way, insurers go to court. In Maine -- one state that aggressively regulates rates -- WellPoint's Anthem subsidiary has sued the insurance superintendent for reducing its requested rate increase. 
 Political clout can be especially advantageous at the federal level, as the big Wall Street banks have so brazenly demonstrated. Over the past two and a half years, WellPoint's employees and associates have contributed more than $922,000 to federal political campaigns, and the company has spent $7.8 million lobbying Washington policymakers, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. It should not be surprising that WellPoint was one of the leading opponents of the public insurance option, which would have subjected it to competition even where it had sewn up the market. 
 Antitrust is no substitute for broader health care reform, but it's an important prerequisite. If a handful of giant health insurers are allowed to dominate the industry, many of the other aspects of reform (establishing insurance exchanges, requiring people to have insurance, even allowing consumers to buy insurance across state lines) won't bring down the price of insurance. 
 Regardless of what happens at the White House's health care meeting on Thursday, we've got to make sure health insurers compete for every one of our dollars. First chance I get I'm going to find another health insurer here in California -- unless Anthem has such a lock on the market I can't find a better deal.

HEADLINE: Water-Cooler Effect: Internet Can Be TV's Friend

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Remember when the Internet was supposed to kill off television?
 That hasn't been the case lately, judging by the record television ratings for big-ticket events. The Vancouver Olympics are shaping up to be the most-watched foreign Winter Games since 1994. This year's Super Bowl was the most-watched program in United States history, beating out the final episode of ''M*A*S*H'' in 1983. Awards shows like the Grammys are attracting their biggest audiences in years.
 Many television executives are crediting the Internet, in part, for the revival. 
 Blogs and social Web sites like Facebook and Twitter enable an online water-cooler conversation, encouraging people to split their time between the computer screen and the big-screen TV. 
 The Nielsen Company, which measures television viewership and Web traffic, noticed this month that one in seven people who were watching the Super Bowl and the Olympics opening ceremony were surfing the Web at the same time.
 ''The Internet is our friend, not our enemy,'' said Leslie Moonves, chief executive of the CBS Corporation, which broadcast both the Super Bowl and the Grammy Awards this year. ''People want to be attached to each other.''
 Seeking to capitalize on the online water-cooler effect, NBC showed the Golden Globes live on both coasts for the first time this year, and the network reportedly wants to do the same for the Emmy Awards this fall, so the entire country can watch (and chat online) simultaneously.
 But sometimes the effect works even when the program is not live. Rachel Velonza, a 23-year-old from Seattle, knew that Johnny Weir failed to win a medal in figure skating long before she ever turned on a television last Thursday, but she stayed up until almost midnight, enduring NBC's much-ridiculed tape delay because she wanted to see for herself why he wound up in sixth place. She knew all her friends were watching because they were talking about it on Twitter (which says it counts 50 million posts every day) and Facebook (which says it surpassed 400 million members this month).
 ''Even though knowing ahead spoils the program, you just can't help but see for yourself what all these people are talking about,'' she said.
 NBC says it thinks the habits of people like Ms. Velonza partly explain why the ratings for the Olympics are up noticeably.
 ''People want to have something to share,'' Alan Wurtzel, the head of research for NBC Universal, said from Vancouver. He said the effects of online conversations were ''important for all big event programming, and also, honestly, for all of television going forward.''
 If viewers cannot be in the same room, the next best thing is a chat room or something like it.
 That's what MTV found last fall during the Video Music Awards: the Twitterati were in a tizzy when Kanye West snatched a microphone from Taylor Swift in the middle of her acceptance speech. The show had an average of nine million viewers, its best performance in six years.
 The Recording Academy, which presents the Grammys, mounted a digital campaign to promote the awards show this year, signing up Facebook fans and monitoring Grammy-related Twitter messages.
 Peter Anton, the academy's vice president for digital media, said it was not a coincidence that the awards show notched a 35 percent gain over last year's audience totals.
 Watching the Olympics, Della Lee, a disabled mother of twins in Springfield, Ore., found herself joking on Twitter about curling with dozens of fellow viewers, and was much more deeply engaged in the broadcast as a result. ''I really got into curling yesterday! It's a fun sport,'' she wrote to a friend later.
 The effect is obviously not limited to television. Online conversations can also help or hinder opening weekends for movies and the ratings for politicians. Recent studies of online social networks have affirmed what researchers have long recognized: people seek to be around and be influenced by like-minded individuals.
 There are other factors contributing to the ratings spikes: attention-grabbing shows (the Super Bowl featured the New Orleans Saints, a popular underdog), gradual population growth and an economic contraction that some analysts say is leading to more people spending more time at home in front of their TV and computer screens. 
 Along with those reasons, ''increased usage of social media is definitely driving the ratings,'' said Jon Gibs, a vice president at Nielsen. He said the Olympic data showing simultaneous TV-and-Web viewing signaled the growing importance of interactivity to the television experience.
 Some of the marquee Olympic events are tape-delayed this month, even though Olympic results are instantly available on the Web. But people are still watching the Games in prime time. 
 Brad Peterson, a lighting designer in New York, heard about the skier Lindsey Vonn's crash before Thursday's replay of it on NBC, but watched regardless. After all, he said, ''I didn't know when, how and who won.'' 
 For Mr. Wurtzel, the Olympics are a lab, and so far he said he has found that people who follow the Olympics both on TV and online wind up being heavier viewers of television.
 Media companies are starting to consider how to incorporate that water-cooler effect -- and how to harness it for day-to-day TV shows, too. For the Olympics, NBC is promoting something called ''You Be the Judge,'' which lets viewers submit their own scores for figure skaters through a Web application and compare their scores to other viewers. The network's Web site also features a gadget that tracks Twitter opinions about the Games. 
 Chloe Sladden, director of media partnerships for Twitter, said sites like Twitter let people feel plugged in to a real-time conversation.
 ''In the future, I can't imagine a major event where the audience doesn't become part of the story itself,'' Ms. Sladden said.

HEADLINE: At F.D.I.C., Bracing For a Wave Of Failures

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is bracing for a new wave of bank failures that could cost the agency many billions of dollars and further strain its finances. 
 With bank failures running at their highest level in nearly two decades, the F.D.I.C. is racing to keep up with rising losses to its insurance fund, which safeguards savers' deposits. On Tuesday, the agency announced that it had placed 702 lenders on its list of ''problem'' banks, the highest number since 1993. 
 Not all of those banks are destined to founder, and F.D.I.C. officials said Tuesday that they expected failures to peak this year. But they also warned that the fund might have to cover $20 billion in additional losses by 2013 -- a bill that could be even greater if the economy worsens. 
 F.D.I.C. officials say the fund has ample resources to cope with its projected losses. 
 ''We think that we have the cash we need,'' Sheila C. Bair, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, said in an interview on Tuesday. She said it was unlikely the F.D.I.C. would need to tap its emergency credit line with the Treasury Department, although she did not rule out such an action. 
 Despite resurgent profits and pay at the giants of American finance, many of the nation's 8,000 banks remain under stress, according to a quarterly report the F.D.I.C. released Tuesday. 
 About 140 banks failed in 2009, and Ms. Bair said she expected even more than that to go under this year. The F.D.I.C. does not disclose which banks it considers at risk. 
 Bad credit card, mortgage and corporate loans escalated in the final months of 2009 -- the 12th consecutive quarterly increase -- albeit at a slower pace. During the fourth quarter, the banking industry as a whole turned a mere $914 million profit. ''We've gone from the eye of the hurricane to cleaning up after the hurricane,'' said Frederick Cannon, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. 
 Still, with so many banks failing, the federal deposit insurance fund has been severely depleted. At the end of 2009, it carried a negative balance of $20.9 billion. 
 The insurance fund is in better shape than such numbers might suggest, however. Officials estimate that bank failures would drain about $100 billion from the fund from 2009 through 2013. But of that amount, a total of roughly $80 billion in losses were recognized last year or projected for 2010. By that math, the agency is expecting an additional $20 billion of losses over the next three years.
 After slipping into the red last fall, the F.D.I.C. moved swiftly to refill its coffers. The agency imposed a special assessment on banks that gave it an immediate $5.6 billion cash infusion. That assessment was in addition to the ordinary payments that banks make to the F.D.I.C. fund.
 In September, the F.D.I.C. ordered banks to prepay quarterly assessments that would have otherwise been due through 2012. That provided an additional $46 billion to restore the fund to normal. For accounting purposes, the agency will add that money to the fund in small doses over the next 13 quarters, which explains the current negative balance. 
 Together, these moves buy time for the agency to determine its next steps in the event its losses worsen. In such a case, banks might be called on to chip in more money, either through new special assessments, prepaid fees or premium increases. F.D.I.C. officials said no such plans were in the works. 
 ''The good news is that the industry will power through this,'' said Bert Ely, a longtime banking industry consultant in Washington. The fund has ''taken a lot of hits along the way, but I still don't expect the taxpayer to ride to the rescue.'' 
 To protect the fund, the F.D.I.C. also has found creative ways to bring in more money. On Tuesday, Ms. Bair said that the agency would soon issue bonds backed by the assets of failed banks and guaranteed by the government. The program aims to attract nontraditional buyers of bank assets, like insurance companies, pension funds and mutual funds. 
 ''We would like to test the market to see if we can get better pricing,'' Ms. Bair said. ''We may or may not succeed, but we thought we should try it.''
 The F.D.I.C. has also tried to entice private equity firms and other investment groups to bid for insolvent banks, with mixed success. The agency is betting that more potential buyers will ultimately result in higher prices.

HEADLINE: On Eve of Health Meeting, Ideas for Bipartisan Deals

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Three years ago this month, a presidential candidate -- John Edwards, as a matter of fact -- started a debate on health reform by announcing a plan to cover the uninsured. Since then, we've had an election, town hall meetings, speeches, Congressional hearings and a special election in Massachusetts.
 Now comes Thursday's bipartisan meeting at the White House, which feels a bit like the start of the final act. And Congress could still end up passing a sweeping bill, a small bill or no bill at all. What follows is a guide to the big lingering questions: 
 Isn't this meeting just for show? 
 Yes, mostly. Democrats and Republicans are well aware of each other's ideas by now. But the meeting still matters. 
 The White House's biggest mistake has been its hands-off approach to the process. President Obama and his aides forgot about what economists call the time value of money -- and of political capital. 
 As a result, health reform has flirted with failure more than once. After those raucous town hall meetings, Mr. Obama needed a prime-time address to get the effort back on track. More recently, Scott Brown's victory in Massachusetts stopped everything, even though the Senate had already passed a bill and the House could pass that bill this afternoon.
 Politics matters, which is why Thursday's meeting matters.
 So what does each side want out of it?
 There will be lots of preening about who is less partisan. But driving the two sides' behavior more than any policy details is this: The White House and many Democrats really want a major bill to pass, and the Republicans really don't. A bill would snatch victory from defeat for Mr. Obama, and it would be a victory that eluded Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon and Harry Truman. No bill would make the Democrats look incompetent.
 Are you telling me there are no bipartisan compromises to be had?
 Not at all. There are some excellent ones.
 Let's agree that a bill should cover millions of uninsured -- a Democratic priority -- but do so largely through private insurers -- a Republican principle. Then let's say that the bill should reduce the growth of health costs, so our grandchildren aren't spending half their income on Medicare taxes.
 That suggests a bill requiring people to have insurance (to prevent freeloading), regulating insurers (to prevent them from cherry-picking the healthy), subsidizing coverage for the uninsured and small businesses and including no new government-run insurance program. All this describes the current Obama plan and the bills that have passed the House and Senate. 
 They are far from radical, but they do lean left. And they would benefit from a few more conservative ideas. Specialized health courts could introduce more sanity to the malpractice process. Competitive bidding could become a bigger part of Medicare. Government subsidies for the costliest insurance plans could be cut immediately -- not in 2018, as Mr. Obama has proposed.
 One more thing: I'm not sure whether paying hospitals for good care, instead of more care, is a conservative idea. Republicans have blasted the Democrats' proposals for doing precisely that. But Newt Gingrich and Bill Frist, former Republican leaders, are right that the bills don't go far enough. A compromise plan could.
 Madame Speaker, I present the Bipartisan Health, Wellness and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2010.
 You're sounding more hopeful. I like it.
 You're forgetting the part about politics mattering.
 Republicans have shown little interest in negotiating a big compromise. Remember how Charles Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, kept moving the goal posts last summer? This is basic game theory: the better Mr. Obama looks, the worse the Republicans' chances are in the midterm elections. Philosophy plays a role, too. Some Republicans believe it's not the government's job to help people get insurance. 
 Mr. Obama, for his part, has shown little interest in adding conservative ideas that do not win him more votes in Congress. House liberals are already unhappy enough. 
 It's not just the politicians' fault, either. AARP opposes some new payment systems, worrying that the elderly will be hurt. Union leaders oppose a tax on high-cost insurance, fearing members will lose good benefits. Business executives oppose giving workers more freedom to choose their own coverage, because companies like having control over heath plans.
 But aren't business executives always saying that health costs are killing them?
 Yes, but that's mostly a sound bite, as the last year has showed. Companies care about how much total compensation they pay. Rising health costs generally come out of worker incomes, not company profits. 
 If health costs were killing businesses, don't you think businesses would have lobbied for measures to reduce costs? Instead, they have been silent or even opposed.
 The fact is, any major change to the health care status quo is scary. We all tend to focus more on what might be worse than what might be better.
 So what happens from here?
 Republicans will use this week's meeting to point out that the current bills are unpopular and to argue that Mr. Obama is proposing a government takeover of health care. As Representative John Kline of Minnesota, the ranking Republican on a House health committee, told me, ''No Republican is going to go back to his home district and say, 'You know what? I was wrong about the health care bill.' '' 
 Mr. Obama will emphasize his plan's specifics, which tend to be more popular. He is also likely to push Republicans for independent evidence that their ideas would work. At a recent meeting with Republicans, he argued that they couldn't just say they favored lower health costs. ''I mean, that's an idea we all embrace,'' he said.
 The Congressional Budget Officehas estimated that the House Republicans' health plan would cover three million people over the next decade and reduce the deficit by $68 billion. Expect the Democrats to note that both the House and Senate bills would cover more than 30 million people and reduce the deficit by about $100 billion. 
 What happens after Thursday?
 The initial action will be among Democrats. If a simple majority of House members and senators agree on a bill, they can pass it.
 And if they can't?
 Then they will try for a bill that covers many fewer people. It could help young adults stay on their parents' insurance or could cover some of the eight million uninsured children. And a much-reduced bill might win some Republican votes. ''The only reasonable way to make progress is to take a smaller bite,'' Mr. Kline says. 
 To take an example from another area -- unemployment -- nearly all Senate Democrats and five Republicans voted Monday for a $15 billion jobs bill.
 But haven't I read economists saying that a bill that small will make almost no dent in unemployment? Is that sort of thing the only hope for bipartisanship? 
 It depends on what you mean by bipartisanship. Nothing is stopping Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats from adding more Republican ideas to their health plan -- and not just fig leaves. If the Democrats did that, they would have a bill worthy of the name bipartisan.

HEADLINE: White House In New Push For Changes On Wall St.

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration redoubled its efforts on Tuesday to overhaul the nation's financial regulations, saying it would not back down from its efforts to restrict the trading activities of banks and to create a consumer agency to regulate financial products.
 In an attempt to thwart fierce lobbying against those measures, among others, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, summoned leaders of the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Bankers Association, the Financial Services Forum and other groups to a meeting on Thursday to urge them not to obstruct the legislative effort. 
 The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher J. Dodd, who is drafting a new version of the regulatory overhaul, met again on Tuesday with Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, in the hope of arriving at a bipartisan measure. 
 Other provisions in contention include whom to exempt from new regulations governing the market for over-the-counter derivatives and how to dissolve financial companies before they pose systemic risk to the economy. 
 The White House renewed its support for a ban on banks that take deposits from making market bets with their own money -- a practice known as proprietary trading. When Mr. Obama announced his support for that ban last month, he called it the ''Volcker rule,'' in honor of Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who has championed the idea.
 ''We're as committed to that now as we were on that day,'' the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said on Tuesday. ''We're not walking away from what the president outlined on the Volcker rule.'' 
 But others involved said it might be difficult to persuade the Senate to go along. In December, the House adopted a plan with a provision to let federal regulators curb proprietary trading if they deem it too risky for banks. 
 Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who wrote that provision, said in an interview that ''the Volcker rule grows out of my amendment,'' and that they shared an aim: ''We're trying to re-establish credibility in the marketplace for financial institutions. They have, through this crisis, rightly or wrongly so, gained a dangerous reputation.'' 
 But Mr. Kanjorski acknowledged that it had been tough to push his amendment through the House, and said that the Volcker rule went even further, because it gave less discretion to regulators.
 W. Michael Blumenthal was one of five former Treasury secretaries who signed a letter this week endorsing the Volcker rule. ''For any reform to be effective, it is important that we go back to separating, in some function or other, the normal banking activities of commercial banks from the trading activities,'' he said in an interview. ''The mixing of those two has gotten us into trouble, and it's important to fix it.''
 A spokesman for Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, said that while Mr. Shelby ''supports the spirit of the Volcker rule,'' he was ''not convinced that the proposal itself is necessary.'' 
 The spokesman, Jonathan Graffeo, added: ''Senator Shelby did not receive clear answers during recent hearings as to how proprietary trading contributed to the financial crisis, or why new authority is necessary given authority that bank regulators already have.''
 Similarly, the proposal for a consumer financial protection agency -- which would regulate mortgages, credit cards, home equity and auto loans and even pawn shops and which was part of the House bill -- also seemed to face a tough road ahead. 
 Critics of the plan argue that it would interfere with ''prudential regulation,'' the rules set up to preserve the safety and soundness of financial institutions. 
 Michael S. Barr, the assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions, tried to allay those concerns on Tuesday. 
 ''Safety-and-soundness regulators have their eyes trained on risks to banks, not risks to consumers,'' he told the Credit Union National Association in a speech at the Washington Convention Center, adding that the new agency would strengthen the banking system. 
 The United States Chamber of Commerce says it supports disclosures to consumers about the risks of financial products and opposes fraudulent and predatory practices. But the chamber argues that a new agency would choke off credit to small businesses, limit consumer choices and lead to higher prices. 
 Even supporters of the proposal said the opposition was daunting. 
 ''We have supported an independent rule-writing agency, and to have the new agency focus on the nonbank sector for enforcement but have rules that apply across the board,'' said Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ''What I am hearing at this point is that they have a steep climb.'' 
 Ms. Bair, a Republican who was appointed by President George W. Bush, added: ''I think that for bipartisan consensus, housing that in a separate agency is not going to happen.'' 
 In asking industry leaders to come to the Treasury on Thursday, Mr. Geithner hopes to underscore the administration's commitment to passing legislation this year, officials said.
 As word of the meeting became public, several of those invited to the Treasury said they were not holding up the legislation. 
 ''One of our key messages will be that markets crave certainty,'' said Robert S. Nichols, president of the Financial Services Forum, which comprises chief executives of 18 of the largest financial institutions. ''I don't think the markets would respond well to a third year of debate over regulatory modernization.''
 Monitoring systemic risk and arranging for a ''resolution authority'' to dissolve failing companies ''in a nonchaotic way'' were priorities for the executives, he said. 
 Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., executive vice president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said, ''Our view very much is that the nation is better off with this happening than not.''

HEADLINE: Five Republican Votes

 BODY:
After a year of partisan gridlock, it was heartening to see five Republican senators break ranks on Monday to advance a $15 billion jobs bill. The 62-to-30 vote clears the way for the bill's final passage this week. 
 The question now is whether that's as good as it gets or whether Americans are seeing a new willingness to work together to truly confront joblessness. By itself, the bill is too small and narrow to make much of a difference. It must be followed up with other steps to create desperately needed jobs. 
 There are reasons to hope for the best. The Breakaway Five -- the newly elected Scott Brown of Massachusetts; Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine; George Voinovich of Ohio and Christopher Bond of Missouri -- appeared motivated by the basic political virtues of common sense and constituent concern. That's a sharp contrast with the strategy of obstruction. 
 Mr. Brown said the bill was not perfect but that he voted for it because it ''would help put people back to work.'' Ms. Snowe said the bill did not go far enough but that the Senate had to demonstrate an ability to act ''in a tough economy.'' 
 The real test of bipartisan commitment to job creation will come soon. The main provision of the current bill -- a $13 billion hiring tax credit -- is unlikely to have much impact unless it's paired with other federal help, mainly extended unemployment benefits and more fiscal aid to states. Without those boosts, an economy afflicted with high unemployment and incessant state-budget cuts cannot generate the consumer demand that employers need to see before adding workers. 
 As it is, extended jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed expire at the end of February, and governors are building deep cuts into upcoming budgets. The Democratic leadership must quickly introduce a bill to extend unemployment benefits through December and to bolster aid to states. If Republicans really care about jobs more than dragging down President Obama, they will support those measures.
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, plans to introduce several other job-creation bills that focus on small businesses, infrastructure spending, clean energy jobs and public-sector employment, like summer youth jobs. One bill that covers all of these important areas would be better because separate bills invite delay and demagoguery, and the jobs crisis is too acute to act as if the nation has the luxury of time. But if the vote on Monday signals a real step forward, new jobs may yet result.

HEADLINE: Bites That Kill: Creating Informative Exhibits on Malaria

BYLINE: CATHERINE HUTCHINGS and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Researching malaria and creating an installation to educate the school community. 

 BODY:
Overview | What do King Tut and impoverished people living in tropical zones have in common? In this lesson, students reflect on malaria through the ages and then create an installation exhibit to educate their peers about the science, health issues and history of malaria. 
Materials | Computers with Internet access, images, photographs or printer, research resources, mosquito bed net, copies of handouts.
Warm-Up | Introduce the topic by having students take this quick quiz (PDF) to find out how much they know about malaria and its recent appearances in the news.
When students are ready, discuss the answers:
1. b (source).
2. c (source).
3. a (source).
4. d (source 1, 2 and 3).
5. d (source).
Ask: What did you find surprising? What else have you heard or do you know about malaria? What is being done where you live, if anything, to help combat malaria in poorer nations around the world? What other questions do you have? Record students' questions on chart paper or a whiteboard for future reference.
Then, follow up the discussion by viewing the slide show "Where Malaria Still Kills." Note that the photographs are provided courtesy of the Malaria Consortium, and are part of an eight-week exhibition at the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan that begins March 15, 2010. For each slide, have a volunteer read the caption aloud. Encourage students to respond to the information and stories with their own comments and questions.
After the slide show, you might also ask: Which images did you find the most powerful or moving and why? Do you worry about or try to avoid mosquito bites where you live and travel? Why or why not? If you do, how do you try to fend off mosquitoes? What mosquito-borne illnesses are prevalent where we live? How are these illnesses similar and different from malaria in terms of threat, severity and treatment? How would your life be different if you lived in a country plagued by malaria?
Related | In the article "Malaria: A Scourge as Old as King Tut," John Noble Wilford reports on mankind's long history with the mosquito and the parasite that causes malaria:
In death if not in life, a bond unites King Tut, Egypt's boy pharaoh, with the multitudes high and especially low through human history. Palace walls could not shield him from the enemy without: the anopheles mosquitoes infesting the Nile Valley with malaria parasites. A post-mortem on Tutankhamen's mummy, scientists reported last week, shows that malaria was one of the most probable agents of his death at age 19, in the 14th century B.C.
Tut's case may be one of the earliest established by genetic tests, but malaria was probably a common scourge then, as it still is. Last year, at least 250 million people contracted the disease, the United Nations estimates, and almost half the world's population is at risk, mainly in poorer tropical lands. [ ]
If there is anything to the mummy's curse, it may be delivered by mosquitoes.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For reading comprehension and discussion:

        
What did scientists and archaeologists recently learn about King Tut?
        
What are some other names for malaria? Where did these names derive from?
        
How has malaria shaped or changed the course of history?
        
If "malaria has been largely eradicated in wealthier countries, and is easily treatable with medicines," why do you think people living in poor, tropical places are still at risk?
        
What solutions can you think of to combat malaria?
Activity | Explain that students will work in pairs or small groups to make an installation exhibit in their school to educate themselves and their classmates about malaria. At this point or before class, hang a mosquito net in the classroom or a public space like the school library.
Ideally, hang the net in a way so students have some space to move around and under it. One net is probably enough, but if you have a large group or many classes, you might consider creating many spaces with multiple nets. (For every net you use for educational purposes, you might consider buying and donating one or more nets to an organization that distributes them for use in Africa and other countries, like Nothing But Nets.)
Explain that mosquito nets work by preventing the Anopheles mosquito, the carrier of the parasite that causes malaria, from biting people who sleep under them. You may want to provide time for students to touch, explore and ask questions about the mosquito net before explaining the project.
Tell students that today they will create the first part of their exhibit: hanging photographs, diagrams and other images that relate to malaria on the outside of the mosquito net. On the back of each image, students will provide "fact bites" in Q. & A. format that tell more about their topic and picture. They will use the net as a place to display their work and images.
Assign each student or small group a topic related to malaria. Here is a list to get you started:

        
Plasmodium.
        
Anopheles mosquitoes.
        
Transmission cycle of malaria.
        
Malaria prevention.
        
ITN's - Insectide-Treated Bed Nets.
        
Anti-malarial drugs.
        
Artemisinin-based combination therapies (A.C.T.'s).
        
Symptoms.
        
Malaria mortality and disease statistics.
        
Malaria information for travelers.
        
Malaria and children.
        
Malaria and pregnant women.
        
Malaria and poverty.
        
Malaria and other diseases (H.I.V./AIDS, dengue, etc.).
        
Malaria and the Nobel Prize.
        
Diagnostic tests.
        
Treatment.
        
Drug Resistance.
        
Vaccine development efforts.
        
Geographic regions affected by malaria.
        
Economic costs of malaria.
        
Malaria and climate change.
Provide students with the following online resources, along with those listed above in Related Resources and any available print materials, to help them find a photograph and research their topic. Students might use the handout Mosquito 'Bites' (PDF) to create their "fact bites."
Online resources include the New York Times Health Guide on Malaria, the malaria information pages from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute. Other useful Web resources: KidsHealth: Malaria, All About Malaria and SciDev.net: Health: Malaria.
Students might refer to the class list of questions they created in the initial exercise to help them brainstorm possible questions related to their topic. Promote good questioning skills by having students hand in a copy of the three questions they plan to include. (Keep a list of questions for the scavenger hunt activity described below.) You might sign off on these questions before they add them to their final product.
Explain that they should "boil down" their research and information into the three most important questions and answers. Stress that composing clear and valuable questions is as important as providing accurate and succinct answers.
Have each group show their image or photograph to the class and share one piece of information that they learned. Then, have students display their finished products on the mosquito net.
Going Further | Using students' questions, create a scavenger hunt handout that lists 10 to 15 of the most important ideas about malaria. You might also add images to the scavenger hunt, so students are searching for visual as well as written information. In a future class, have students complete the scavenger hunt by searching the images and information hung on the class mosquito net. You might also consider having copies of the scavenger hunt available for other students and exhibit visitors.
Additionally, students might collaborate and add more about malaria by creating a theme for a mini-exhibit to be placed under the mosquito net. For example, students might use their historical knowledge and the recent discovery about King Tut's death to imagine how ancient Egyptians might have been affected by malaria. To provide context and motivation, have students pretend they are creating an exhibit to be added to this traveling exhibition on King Tut.
Or students might do a cross-curricular project with a history or literature class and design their exhibit around a different time period or location, like the 19th century United States or ancient Rome, or on references to malaria in literature.
Students might also focus the inside space on activism and what they can do to help combat malaria. This might include the efforts by organizations such as Malaria No More or the Gates Foundation's work on malaria. They might culminate this with a fund-raiser.

HEADLINE: Who's That Grl? Svedka Vodka Brings a Mascot to TV

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THERE are all sorts of strange characters pitching products on television, among them a jovial giant, as green as the vegetables he peddles; a bald man in a white T-shirt, obsessed with cleanliness; and an insurance-loving lizard with a Cockney accent. Now their ranks are being joined by a sensual female robot from the future who adores vodka.
 The so-called fembot is the character for Svedka, an increasingly popular vodka brand imported from Sweden, which is taking to television advertising for the first time. The initial TV commercial, which will double as a video clip online, is part of a new campaign for Svedka, created internally, that carries the theme ''R.U. Bot or Not?'' 
 Svedka joins a long list of distilled spirits that have started to use television as an ad medium in this country. Since 1996, when stations and networks began rewriting decades-old policies against running liquor spots, major labels like Bacardi, Captain Morgan and Johnnie Walker have added TV to their media schedules along with mainstays like magazines, billboards and the Internet.
 That arrival on video has been accelerating recently as local stations in major markets owned by the largest broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- accept liquor commercials. (The policies against carrying such commercials nationally on those networks remain unchanged.)
 Many other vodkas have preceded Svedka onto TV, including bigger brands like Absolut, Grey Goose and Smirnoff. As sales of Svedka continue to grow, it becomes economically feasible for the brand to spend the additional money that advertising on television requires.
 ''TV is important because it gives you the reach to get more visible,'' said Marina Hahn, senior vice president for marketing at Constellation Brands in New York, which oversees Svedka.
 Impact, the influential trade publication from M. Shanken Communications, calls Svedka ''the market's hottest brand for several years running,'' with an average annual compound growth rate in case distribution of 42 percent from 2004 to 2009.
 One reason for that growth, Impact reported in its Jan. 1-15 issue, is Svedka's price -- higher than domestic brands like Smirnoff but ''well below'' that of rival imports like Absolut, Ketel One and Stolichnaya. 
 That made a significant difference last year as consumers drank more, according to data from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, but switched to lower-priced products because of the economy.
 As crucial as price is, Ms. Hahn said, ''you've got to do more than sell on price,'' particularly in the vodka category.
 ''More and more, image is of paramount importance,'' she added, as a ''gazillion vodkas are entering the market.''
 The Svedka image, in ads that have run since 2005, is playful, even naughty, featuring the sexy fembot symbolizing the brand's fanciful futuristic achievement of being voted the ''No. 1 vodka'' in the year 2033.
 ''Our vision of the future is very different'' from others, Ms. Hahn said, in that the ads present 2033 as ''a lot like today, but better, more fun'' and Svedka as the vodka that lets you ''be your fun, flirtatious self.''
 ''It's good to have some release in this dire time,'' she added, ''at a price point you can afford.''
 The fun-filled spirit comes across in the new campaign, which also includes print and online ads, signs in stores, billboards, events in bars and nightclubs and a presence on Facebook. There are plans for Svedka to also be on Twitter and YouTube, Ms. Hahn said.
 The commercial uses computer-generated imagery to bring to life the fembot, known as Svedka Grl, in a dance-club setting.
 Joining the character are hip-looking nightlife denizens who do the robot dance to a version of ''Dancing Machine'' by the Jackson 5, as remixed by Scott Spock, a songwriter and producer.
 The commercial was conceived by Tom Campbell, who oversees the internal creative team for Svedka, and directed by Francis Lawrence, a director of music videos.
 ''Maybe one day, 'Svedka Grl, the Movie,' '' Ms. Hahn said, laughing.
 (That may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. Another Svedka competitor, Skyy vodka, sold by Gruppo Campari, built an elaborate promotional campaign around the 2008 movie ''Sex and the City'' and, MediaPost Marketing Daily reported last week, is creating a similar campaign for ''Sex and the City 2,'' coming in May.)
 The Svedka commercial is scheduled to start running on Monday on four cable channels that accept liquor ads: Bravo, Comedy Central, E! and FX. The spot is to appear on series like ''Chelsea Lately,'' ''The Colbert Report,'' ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' ''Damages,'' ''Kell on Earth,'' ''Millionaire Matchmaker,'' ''Shear Genius,'' ''Sons of Anarchy'' and ''Top Chef.''
 On E!, a cocktail made with Svedka, called the Hot Bot, is to be featured during its live ''After Party'' show on March 7 that will follow the Academy Awards.
 The campaign is to appear through mid-April, then return in September and run through most of October. The budget is estimated at more than $20 million, half of which is to be earmarked for the television, print, online and outdoor ads.
 According to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP that tracks ad spending, Constellation spent $5.6 million to advertise Svedka in major media last year, up 42.5 percent from the $3.9 million spent in 2007.
 In the first nine months of 2009, $4.8 million was spent to advertise Svedka in major media, Kantar Media reported, an increase of 4.8 percent from the $4.5 million spent during the same period in 2008. (Full-year figures for 2009 are not yet available.)

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Moves on Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A hedge fund that has acquired a significant portion of the debt on the troubled Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village complexes in Manhattan moved in court this week to take control of them.
 The move is expected to complicate the already byzantine political and financial situation surrounding the largest apartment complexes in Manhattan, and to send tremors though 25,000 tenants worried about the future.
 Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village were bought by a partnership of Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty in 2006 for a record $5.4 billion. But the owners defaulted on their $3 billion mortgage in January and have since agreed to turn the properties, long an affordable oasis for working- and middle-class tenants, over to lenders. 
 One debt holder, Appaloosa Management, a fund led by David Tepper that is based in New Jersey, filed papers in United States District Court in Manhattan on Tuesday challenging the company currently overseeing the two sprawling complexes on behalf of lenders, saying that the company had acted ''irrationally and imprudently'' in pursuing a course that could cost debt holders hundreds of millions of dollars.
 In its motion to intervene, Appaloosa objected to a decision by the company, CW Capital Management, to foreclose on the owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. Arguing that a foreclosure could cost as much as $200 million in transfer taxes, Appaloosa said that CW Capital should have pushed the owners to go into bankruptcy court, thereby avoiding those taxes.
 Mr. Tepper said that he did not want to take over the complexes so much as he wanted to stop CW Capital from acting in a ''reckless'' manner.
 It was unclear, Appaloosa said, whether debt holders would be liable for more than $200 million in rent rebates. Last year, New York's highest court ruled that the owners had improperly converted 4,400 apartments to market rates.
 The sale of Stuyvesant Town, as well as hundreds of other ''meat-and-potato'' apartment buildings in the city, set off a hue and cry during the residential housing boom from tenants and elected officials about the loss of affordable housing. That loss has become even more palpable as many of these highly leveraged deals unraveled when property values plummeted. 
 ''The fact that these investors so grossly overleveraged these buildings is a symptom of the larger economic crisis that we're all dealing with now,'' said Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development. ''The fact that some of these players are trying to further maximize their profit, again at the expense of affordable housing in the city, is pretty horrifying.''
 Although rents at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village only covered about two-thirds of the debt service on the $3 billion mortgage, Tishman Speyer and BlackRock had planned on increasing profits by converting rent stabilized apartments to market rates. But their plan failed, and the property is now worth an estimated $1.8 billion.
 ''The tenants are not in favor of prolonged legal wrangling,'' said Daniel R. Garodnick, a city councilman who has lived in the complexes all his life. ''We don't think it will be helpful to extend the process here by fighting among the creditor parties.''
 Appaloosa, which has asked the court to allow it to intervene in the matter, also claims that CW Capital has ''irreconcilable conflicts of interest'' because it is both the ''servicer'' for the mortgage and a key debt holder.
 The $3 billion Stuyvesant Town mortgage was combined with mortgages from other properties and sold to many investors as a commercial mortgage-backed security. But some debt holders have a higher standing for getting paid than others, which can become a major point of contention if the property is worth less than the mortgage.
 Mr. Tepper, whose company has acquired control of more than $750 million of $3 billion in mortgages held by five separate trusts, said in an interview Wednesday that he wanted CW Capital to fulfill its fiduciary interest to debt holders to maximize recovery of the mortgage. He said his company was surprised by CW Capital's sudden decision to foreclose.
 ''We actually want them to do what they're supposed to do,'' Mr. Tepper said of CW Capital. ''We're trying to uphold our rights.''
 Appaloosa made a profit of about $7 billion last year, including $2.5 billion for Mr. Tepper. His firm has been recently focused on buying debt at a steep discount that is backed by loans on properties like Stuyvesant Town, although he said he had first acquired some of the Stuyvesant Town debt in 2008. The more money that debt holders get for the property in a resale, the bigger his profit.
 Mr. Tepper said his interests were not ''at odds'' with those of tenants. ''We recognize the fact that at some point, there needs to be some degree of rent controlled apartments there,'' he said.
 While the most recent appraisal put the value of the complexes at about $1.8 billion, many analysts and investors say that over time the complexes, which contain more than 11,000 apartments, will be worth far more.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, who has been active on behalf of the tenants, said Wednesday: ''We must avoid going back to the future and having any new buyer overpay for the complex that leaves tenants with an uncertain future, and we can't have that. The bottom line is we must protect current and future tenants and preserve Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village as havens for the middle class.''
 The Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association is pursuing a plan that would allow some tenants to buy their apartments, while ensuring that thousands of other units stay affordable under the state's rent rules.

HEADLINE: Where Wit and Genre Filmmaking Collide

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
Four features and a handful of shorts: that hardly qualifies as a mini-festival, let alone a luxuriously titled retrospective of a major international filmmaker. Yet that's what ''Monsters and Murderers: The Films of Bong Joon-ho'' is. Beginning Thursday night at the BAMcinematek in Brooklyn, this five-day series will present the entire output of Mr. Bong, a Korean writer-director who is one of the most seriously entertaining film artists around.
 South Korean movies that have more on their minds than lank-haired ghosts or baroque violence tend to share a tight set of concerns: corruption, individual liberty, fraying families, the changing balance of power between women and men. These flow from the dislocations of recent Korean history, in which authoritarian rule spurred violent protest and an economic ''miracle'' meant both liberalization and the deterioration of traditional values. For added spice, there are always the issues of American domination and separation from the North. 
 These are Mr. Bong's themes as well, but no other director of the current Korean film renaissance has handled them with the same sort of finesse. From his first feature, ''Barking Dogs Never Bite,'' in 2000, he has done justice to the storytelling demands of a variety of genres -- the paranoid thriller, the police procedural, the scary-monster movie -- while wrapping them in his bone-dry, perfectly calibrated wit. For American audiences it's an unusually friendly combination.
 ''Monsters and Murderers'' includes Mr. Bong's best-known films, ''Memories of Murder'' and ''The Host,'' but its highlights are a sneak preview of his most recent release, ''Mother,'' which opens in New York on March 12, and the rare opportunity to see ''Barking Dogs.'' That film opens with the proclamation, ''No animals were harmed in the making of this film.'' A series of small, annoying dogs meet or are threatened with gruesome, if fictional, ends, but the real violence is done to human self-esteem.
 The story concerns a low-level academic who discovers that bribery is the only way to obtain a professorship and at least partly even the playing field with his imperious, more gainfully employed wife. Adding to his troubles is the incessant yapping of a neighbor's dog in the high-rise apartment block where nearly all the action takes place. A sudden opportunity to dispose of this pet sets in motion a pitch-black comic plot in which a janitor with a taste for dog soup and a spacey bookkeeper with a hero complex also figure prominently.
 The humor in ''Barking Dogs'' is broader than that of Mr. Bong's later films -- in one recurring motif the wife hands her husband bags of nuts and orders him to crack them with a hammer for her dinner. The basic joke: If a Korean man allows it, he'll be treated worse than a dog, and probably deserve it. ''Dogs'' may be minor compared with the elegant ''Memories of Murder'' and the high-octane ''Host,'' but it's funny from start to finish and showed that Mr. Bong's films would not be characterized by the misogyny that finds such multifarious expression in Korean cinema. 
 It also benefits from the presence of the fearless comedian Bae Doo-na as the bookkeeper. Mr. Bong tends to attract a high class of actor: Ms. Bae reappears as the aunt with a talent for archery in ''The Host'' (2006), that rollicking combination of creature feature, SARS parable, eco-drama, agitprop and dysfunctional-family comedy; and Song Kang-ho, star of a good share of the most prominent South Korean movies of the last 12 years, brings his hangdog charisma to both ''The Host'' and ''Memories of Murder.''
 ''Murder'' (2003) remains the best combination so far of Mr. Bong's anarchic impulses and his meticulous genre craftsmanship. Based on a string of killings in a South Korean village in the late 1980s, it stars Mr. Song as a bumptious local cop who relies entirely on his shaky instincts, and Kim Sang-kyung as a more sophisticated detective who arrives from Seoul to take over the case. ''Brainy geeks like you can go to America,'' the hometown boy says, setting up the fault lines of old versus new and small town versus big city along which the case will fracture.
 Other touchstones appear: a call for help goes unanswered because all the extra cops are off suppressing a demonstration; the breakthrough in the case is made by the only female officer in the station; semen samples must be mailed to America for DNA analysis. Beautifully composed and adroitly paced, the film is suffused with a melancholy that Mr. Bong, in his signature trick, somehow marries to low humor. When the detectives connect the killings to a man seen lurking near a school outhouse, they go to investigate and have to push through a crowd in the schoolyard. Only the attentive viewer will note, with satisfaction, the reason: it's time for a gas-attack drill.
 ''Monsters and Murderers: The Films of Bong Joon-ho'' runs Thursday through Monday at the BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; schedule: bam.org. Mr. Bong will appear for questions after the 7 p.m. screening of ''Mother'' on Friday and the 6:30 p.m. screening of ''The Host'' on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Florida: Smoker's Award Is Slashed

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Concluding that a jury was moved by emotion rather than evidence, a judge on Wednesday reduced to nearly $39 million the $300 million in damages that had been awarded to a Florida smoker against Philip Morris USA. The judge, Jeffrey Streitfeld of Broward County Circuit Court, said jurors granted Cindy Naugle, 61, a ''grossly excessive'' amount of punitive and non-economic damages. Ms. Naugle, a longtime Benson & Hedges smoker, has emphysema, cannot breathe without an oxygen bottle and needs a lung transplant, according to trial testimony. Philip Morris intends to appeal the lower award.

HEADLINE: Everything's Breaking. Is It the Weekend Yet?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE SLATALLA. 
E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MY daughter Clementine was the first to notice that everything breaks when my husband is out of town.
 ''Dad is kind of like a reverse Cat in the Hat,'' she said. ''When he comes into the house, everything starts working again.''
 ''You give him a lot of credit,'' I said, cranky because the kitchen clock had suddenly stopped working, its hands frozen at 6:23, and I couldn't find the right-size replacement battery in the junk drawer. 
 Not that I'm complaining. I would never do that, despite the fact that last month my husband started commuting from California to New York, where he's living a nice, ordered hotel life like George Clooney does in ''Up in the Air,'' while I stay home and manage the chaos surrounding our coming cross-country move.
 Also, I walk the dogs, at 6:30 a.m.
 After I feed the dogs. At 6.
 It takes a long time because Otto, our 11-year-old Labrador retriever, can't really chew anymore. You could describe him as broken -- or at least, his jaw -- but maybe it's just a coincidence that his condition deteriorated severely around the time my husband stopped being around to fix Otto's special meals every day. You have to make an omelet and cut it into bite-size pieces and blow on them to cool the eggs before putting forkfuls down Otto's throat.
 Except on Fridays. That's the day my husband arrives home, sheds his suitcase and briefcase and coat and shoes on the floor right inside the front door, and says: ''The flight was terrible. I've already seen all the movies.''
 Then my husband opens the refrigerator, tosses Otto a piece of sliced honey turkey ($12.99 a pound) and, like some kind of a miracle, the dog catches the meat in midair, works his jaws around it for a while and then swallows.
 ''He seems better,'' my husband says, patting Otto on a part of his head that isn't collapsed.
 Having a long-distance spouse is not a condition I would wish on anyone else, although more people than ever may be living with one in this uncertain economy, according to Alan E. Pisarski, the author of the Transportation Research Board study ''Commuting in America.''
 That's because, during bad times, workers historically have been willing to travel longer distances to jobs. But these days, many of their families are frozen in place; fewer people are moving significant distances than at any time since the Census Bureau started collecting the statistic, Mr. Pisarski said.
 ''Either families are under water on the mortgage and can't sell the house, or they don't move because they can't afford to buy a house in the new location where the job is,'' he said.
 Mr. Pisarski, himself a frequent flier, recently met a fellow passenger on a flight from Denver to Washington who appeared to know all of the flight attendants and who greeted several other passengers by their first names.
 ''It turned out that he and a lot of the other passengers were regular commuters, who had been taking the same flight every week for so long that they had formed their own community on the plane,'' Mr. Pisarski said.
 The thing that those of us with long-distance spouses should hold on to, Mr. Pisarski said, is that most of these extreme commutes are temporary. Life will eventually settle down again. ''The odds of someone who is still commuting so far to work five years later would be unlikely,'' he said.
 ''Five years?'' I asked.
 ''It would take a toll,'' he said.
 In other words, somebody like me, who has to put up with it for only five months, might be better off looking at this whole situation as a minor inconvenience -- something that adds character to what will surely be a ''big adventure,'' as my husband puts it.
 Last Friday, my husband walked into the kitchen, surveyed the counter strewn with stray batteries, screws and wrong-size screwdrivers and asked, ''What happened?''
 ''The clock broke,'' I said.
 He shook it.
 ''It seems fine now,'' he said. He hung the clock on the wall and remarked, to no one in particular: ''Oh, here's the screw I've been looking for. Isn't that good luck?''
 Then he went upstairs and screwed some wheel thing back onto a chair that has been sitting lopsided for weeks.
 ''Can you reset the cable connection?'' I called upstairs.
 ''I just did,'' he called back down.
 He also found a missing remote (it was under a bed), tightened a loose knob and remarked, in passing, that this business of packing and moving must really agree with me, I was looking so thin.
 And although I am not looking particularly thin and realized that this was just a ruse on his part (not unlike the time in 1989 when, the day after I gave birth, he claimed that I looked ''undernourished''), I heard myself asking if he wanted to go to his favorite restaurant for dinner.
 Thirty-six hours later he headed back East where, he said, he was thinking about getting ''one of those nice New York haircuts.''
 A haircut! I was hoping that today I might actually have time to wash my hair.
 Then Otto started making gagging noises again, and the clock froze, and the car developed a rattle, and I leaned into the chaos that was part of the big adventure, and the next thing I knew, a few days had passed.
 One morning, as I was cracking eggs at 6, after Otto knocked the screen door off its track, my iPhone buzzed: an e-mail message from someone with a fresh haircut.
 ''Last night, the snow was coming down in Greenwich Village and there were a lot of people walking pairs of little dogs and it was so beautiful in that way you remember N.Y.,'' he wrote. ''I am so sorry that everything is falling on your skinny shoulders, but it will all turn out, I promise.''
 ''You had me at 'skinny,' '' I wrote back.
 ''Yeah, figured,'' he wrote.

HEADLINE: Watch How You Hold That Crayon

BYLINE: By PEG TYRE

 BODY:
NOAH LASCANO, 8, had a problem: His teachers couldn't read his handwriting. His homework became a frustrating exercise in writing once, and then, at the teacher's request, writing again, just for legibility.
 His brother, James, 5, was struggling in kindergarten -- even drawing stick figures was a task. When his mother, Paula Lascano, tried to cajole him into completing a few workbook assignments, he reported that ''his hand got too tired.'' 
 Like many parents, Ms. Lascano decided it was time for help, so 10 months ago she hired Casey Halper, a pediatric occupational therapist, to work first with James, and then with Noah, once a week. The boys manipulated stiff green putty, put pegs into boards, created chains of pennies and plastic connectors and wrote the alphabet -- again and again.
 These days, many little fingers are being drilled. Twenty-five years ago, pediatric occupational therapists primarily served children with severe disabilities like spina bifida, autism or cerebral palsy. Nowadays, these therapists are just as focused on helping children without obvious disabilities to hold a pencil. 
 In affluent neighborhoods in and around New York, occupational therapists have taken their place next to academic tutors, psychologists, private coaches and personal trainers -- the army that often stands behind academically successful students. 
 Tim Nanof, legislative manager for the American Occupational Therapy Association, which has 38,000 members, said it's hard to know exactly how many children are receiving these services. But parents, pediatricians, educators and early childhood experts agree that plenty of able-bodied children are receiving occupational therapy. 
 ''Twenty years ago, you could find O.T.'s working with children at hospitals or schools for the blind or the deaf,'' said Christine Berg, who oversees the curriculum for the Program in Occupational Therapy at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ''Now, many pediatric O.T.'s see their role as promoting fitness and enhancing kids' performance in school.'' 
 Pediatric occupational therapy may be something like Pilates for the pint-size set -- a regime of techniques that promise to bestow unique benefits on the practitioner. Or, like the increase in neuropsychological testing and in the use of drugs to enhance a child's attention, the increase in therapy could suggest something may have gone awry in schools, in our level of academic expectations or perhaps in childhood itself. 
 ''On one hand, I think it's perfectly in line with the contemporary trend for parents and educators to seek high-priced specialists to treat the routine problems of childhood,'' said Dr. Philippa Gordon, a popular pediatrician in Park Slope, Brooklyn, who is a medical adviser to the highly opinionated Park Slope Parents Web site. ''On the other hand, I see that early intervention can keep little problems from becoming big ones.'' 
 Linda Florin, who runs a private concierge service in Manhattan, paid a therapist $125 a week for nearly three years to help her son, Wyatt, now a first grader at Columbia Prep, improve his hand strength and control a pencil. She says it was money well spent. ''School isn't easy and it gets harder as they get older,'' Ms. Florin said. ''I wanted him to be able to keep up with everyone else.'' 
 She also said the stigma is gone: ''Back when I was a child, seeing an O.T.? Forget it. That was for kids who had spinal cord injuries.'' Last year, she said, so many friends from her social circle were taking their children to occupational therapists that it seemed like a part of normal childhood.
 ''Seeing an O.T. was once an admission that something was seriously wrong with your child,'' said Paula McCreedy, who, with her partner, Prudence Heisler, opened a branch of their busy Greenwich Village practice in Brooklyn Heights in part to meet the growing demand of private paying families seeking therapy. These days, she said, ''many parents are finding that pediatric occupational therapists can help their children to be the best that they can be.''
 In Manhattan, the brutally competitive nursery and kindergarten admissions process is leading many parents to sign up their toddlers for therapy. ''Preschool admissions tests loom large,'' said Margie Becker-Lewin, an occupational therapist on the Upper West Side. ''In many cases, parents know there is nothing wrong with their child, but they feel caught in the middle.''
 Their child might be exhibiting a minor fine-motor delay at a play group, she added, ''and the parents understand that as the children get involved in the admissions process that there is not as much tolerance for a range of abilities as there once was.''
 One father on the Upper East Side said anxiety about his son's grip -- his 3-year-old holds crayons in his fist -- propelled him to seek therapy.
 ''The nursery admission people tell you they want your child to be ready to learn how to write,'' said the father, who spoke anonymously so his son wouldn't run afoul of nursery school administrators. ''And I knew they would take one look at the way my son held a crayon and he'd be out of the running.'' 
 The father pointed out that many families use occupational therapists to help their children gain admission to elite schools. ''Even with the economy like it is, the hottest question when we socialized at our country house this summer was not what country club do you belong to, but who is your child's O.T. back in the city. And how can I get an appointment?'' 
 For some grade-school children, occupational therapists are also filling the void left by schools, many of which no longer provide instruction on the mechanics of handwriting. According to a survey conducted by the American Occupational Therapy Association, about 30 percent of their members now work in schools, up from 18.6 percent in 1999. Those therapists, said Ms. Berg of Washington University, tend to spend the bulk of their time helping children write legibly.
 ''Many teachers don't know how to do it,'' Ms. Berg said. ''O.T.'s can help.'' 
 Linda Tulloch waited in vain for teachers at the North Street School, a public elementary school in Greenwich, Conn., to provide her son, Jack, now a fifth grader, with handwriting instruction. ''As early as second grade I could see he needed help shaping his letters and numbers,'' she said. 
 But Jack's teachers told her that handwriting was old school and that students would wield a keyboard, not a pencil. ''That didn't sit well with me,'' Ms. Tulloch said. ''Kids can't use a keyboard to take a test or do math.'' Ultimately, Ms. Tulloch hired a tutor, who uses a handwriting program, Handwriting Without Tears, designed by an occupational therapist. 
 Steve Sanders, director of the University of South Florida School of Physical Education and Exercise Science, also points to ramped-up expectations. ''I'd say schools that push serious academics into kindergarten and pre-school -- and emphasize sitting at desks and learning -- are creating some of this problem,'' he said.
 But Anthony DiCarlo, the longtime principal of the William E. Cottle Elementary School in Tuckahoe, N.Y., a suburb north of Manhattan, said that many children are experiencing delays in their fine and gross motor skills.
 ''Almost all our kids come into kindergarten able to recite their letters and their numbers,'' Mr. DiCarlo said. ''Some can even read. But in the last five years, I've seen a dramatic increase in the number of kids who don't have the strength in their handsto wield a scissors or do arts and crafts projects, which in turn prepares them for writing.'' 
 Many kindergartners in his community, he said, have taken music appreciation classes or participated in adult-led sports teams or yoga. And most have also logged serious time in front of a television or a computer screen. But very few have had unlimited opportunities to run, jump and skip, or make mud pies and break twigs. ''I'm all for academic rigor,'' he said, ''but these days I tell parents that letting their child mold clay, play in the sand or build with Play-Doh builds important school-readiness skills, too.'' 
 The problem has become so acute that two years ago, Mr. DiCarlo hired a full-time occupational therapist to work with the 500 students in his elementary school. The therapist, Deirdre Madden, spends 40 percent of her day with children who have diagnosed disabilities, and the rest of her time improving the fine motor skills and muscle control of the rest of the students.
 ''In my previous job I was working with children who had much more severe disabilities, and I couldn't really see what role I'd have in a regular school,'' Ms. Madden said. ''But it turns out that many of the children here needed more support. And I'm only too happy to help.''

HEADLINE: At Saks and TJX, Luxuries and Discounts Rebound

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Consumers were more willing in recent months to treat themselves to things they did not need, like baubles and little black dresses. But only if those indulgences could be had for recession-friendly prices. 
 That was underscored on Wednesday when two of the nation's best-known clothing and accessories purveyors, Saks and the TJX Companies, reported their quarterly earnings. 
 Saks, the upscale department store, posted a loss of $4.6 million, or 3 cents a share, for the three months ended Jan. 30, compared with a loss of $99.7 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health, declined 4.8 percent compared with the period a year ago. 
 Were it not for several one-time costs that hurt the results, Saks would have had earnings of 6 cents a share. 
 The luxury retailer narrowed its losses by cutting costs, lowering its inventory and striving to appeal to frugal-minded customers. In 2010 it will offer more entry-level prices on designer brands, as well as more exclusive and private label merchandise. Today about 10 percent of the chain's merchandise is exclusive; the plan is to increase that to about 20 percent.
 ''The consumer's mind-set has changed,'' Stephen I. Sadove, the chief executive of Saks, said in an interview, ''how they're defining value has changed.'' 
 For instance, dresses that can be worn to work and then out on the town are selling well at Saks because consumers are aiming to get more bang for their buck. 
 Mr. Sadove described the luxury sector as much more stable and predictable than last year. ''The consumer's starting to be a bit more comfortable,'' he said. 
 Still, during a conference call on Wednesday he noted that ''we have yet to see a meaningful rebound in consumer demand.'' 
 Discount chains have been performing far better than upscale stores throughout the economic downturn, and on Wednesday, TJX, which owns chains including TJ Maxx and Marshalls, posted a profit of $395 million, or 94 cents a share, for the period ended Jan 30, compared with $251 million, or 58 cents a share, last year. Sales rose 10 percent, to $5.9 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year climbed 12 percent. 
 ''In 2009, one of the worst economic periods that the U.S., Canada, and Europe have seen, TJX generated superior earnings growth,'' Carol Meyrowitz, the chief executive of TJX, said in a news release. ''Sales growth was driven by a large increase in transactions as we attracted new customers from all income levels with our compelling values.''
 TJX has thrived in recent months as consumers thumbed through its racks for brand names at low prices. While the luxury sector has not been as lucky, there were signs of improvement. 
 Saks said in its most recent reporting period that it experienced relative strength in its women's designer sportswear, handbags, shoes and jewelry categories, as well as its OFF 5th outlet business. Also, its Internet business thrived, posting a 23 percent sales increase. 
 Another positive sign for retailers is that consumers bought more items at full price. Mr. Sadove said shoppers began to realize that inventories were so low that waiting for an item to go on sale might mean being left empty-handed. Saks plans to continue weaning shoppers off discounts with tactics like excluding some products from certain promotions. 
 Retailers are sensitive, though, to what their customers want. ''It's one thing to have higher prices,'' said Ronald L. Frasch, president and chief merchandising officer of Saks, ''but if you don't sell them it doesn't mean anything.''
 Some good news also came from Saks's New York City flagship, which outperformed the rest of the chain's store base after being hit hard last year by the recession. Mr. Sadove, who described the economic recovery as more of an L-shape than a V-shape, said the tenor of the city felt better. He said he had noticed a pickup in tourism, more confidence from people with jobs on Wall Street and increased activity at the city's restaurants. 
 ''I think New York City is coming back a bit,'' Mr. Sadove said, adding that it has ''still got a long way to go.''
 The same is true of the luxury sector. But on Wednesday Wall Street was satisfied enough to send shares of Saks up 2 cents, to $7.10 a share. Shares of TJX, which is based in Framingham, Mass., rose $1.33, or 3 percent, to $40.51 a share.

HEADLINE: A Jumble of Strong Feelings After Vote on a Troubled School

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
CENTRAL FALLS, R.I. -- Like many other teenagers in this troubled city, Sheila Gomes said she found a surrogate family outside her home at Central Falls High School. 
 But with the school board's decision on Tuesday to dismiss the entire faculty as part of a turnaround plan for the chronically underperforming school, some say they are losing one of the few constants in the state's poorest city, where 41 percent of children live in poverty and 63 percent of the high school's students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.
 ''My teachers, they're there for me. They push me forward,'' said Ms. Gomes, a 17-year-old senior whose father is largely absent and whose mother works long hours at a factory. ''My parents, they tried to, but they don't know how. I don't think they fully know me as a person to help me.'' 
 This former mill town of about 19,000, where unemployment is 13.8 percent, is now embroiled in a battle over school reform similar to those that have taken place in troubled districts in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, where officials have tried to fix failing schools by starting over with new staff members. Seventy-four teachers and 19 staff members in Central Falls will lose their jobs.
 ''The status quo needs to change,'' Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in an interview. ''This is not the kind of stability I want. I'm looking for improvement.'' 
 Teachers acknowledge that change is needed -- the school's graduation rate is 48 percent, and only 7 percent of students are proficient in mathematics by 11th grade -- but they say they are struggling against difficult odds.
 ''We're carrying this immense burden here,'' said George McLaughlin, 60, a guidance counselor at the school. ''We have a bag of bricks on our back that you don't get at places where it's taken for granted that everyone will succeed.'' 
 Central Falls has always been a city of immigrants, and boasts that it crowds ''the whole world'' into just over a square mile. Densely packed with triple-deckers, Central Falls calls itself ''a city with a bright future,'' but the poverty rate has consistently been high and the budget low. 
 In 1991, Central Falls transferred operation of its schools to the state. The city maintains the buildings, but state and federal financing pays for the schools. 
 The system is under the direction of Rhode Island's education board, which deemed it one of the state's six worst-performing schools, instructing the superintendent, Frances Gallo, to choose one of four federally mandated models for school turnaround. Dr. Gallo said she chose the model called a ''turnaround'' plan after the teachers union rejected conditions in another state plan. 
 While teachers and students at the close-knit school said they considered one another family, Dr. Gallo said the current model was not working. 
 ''If it's such a family, then how do you account for losing more than half your family each year?'' Dr. Gallo said, referring to the dropout rate. ''We are about to change the culture of Central Falls.'' 
 But many in the school think the culture of the school is one of its biggest assets. 
 ''I leave here at 6, 7 at night, working with kids, coaching, getting lesson plans, doing interactive literacy. That's what people don't see,'' said Frank DelBonis, who teaches history to English as a Second Language students in a school where 70 percent of students are Hispanic.
 Other teachers said progress was hampered by the high turnover at the school, where one in three students leaves each year. 
 ''They're a transient community. It's more than test grades,'' said Kathy Casalino, a math teacher. ''We give them a family. We show them how to live.'' 
 Theresa Agonia, 18, a freshman at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I., is one of dozens of former students who are returning to the school to protest the move. She attended a rally before the board meeting Tuesday night. 
 ''I feel like they're saying my education, my certificate, was worth nothing,'' said Ms. Agonia, who graduated in 2009. ''I worked for my diploma, as everyone else did. To be just a statistic is hurtful.'' 
 Hope Evanoff, a French teacher, said she felt the decision was undermining her career. 
 ''It makes you feel like all of your expertise, all that you know, any degree you might have, is worthless,'' Ms. Evanoff said. ''I've never been fired from anything, and to be fired, it's devastating.''
 The faculty members have been offered counseling by the district, according to one of the fired teachers.
 The Central Falls Teachers Union plans to fight the plan, saying it comes in the middle of a three-year contract. 
 Dr. Gallo said the district was ''looking for partners'' like Teach for America to provide teachers for the school, which has also been receiving ''resumes from all over the nation'' as news of the plan spread.
 Gov. Donald L. Carcieri, a Republican and a former math teacher, said he supported the board's decision, calling it ''courageous,'' and he criticized the union as being an ''obstacle'' to change.
 ''We can no longer stand by as our schools underperform,'' Mr. Carcieri said in a statement. 
 But Ms. Agonia and others said they would keep fighting.
 ''These teachers mean a lot to me,'' she said. ''They didn't turn their back on me, and I won't turn my back on them.''

HEADLINE: Mall Operator Plans to Split Company to Exit Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
The mall operator General Growth Properties said on Wednesday that it would split into two companies as part of a plan to lift itself out of one of the largest real estate bankruptcy cases in corporate history. Under the plan, Brookfield Asset Management, a large real estate investment firm, would invest $2.63 billion.
 The complex proposal is aimed at fending off an unsolicited $10 billion takeover bid by the country's largest mall operator, the Simon Property Group. General Growth has rejected that bid as too low. Under its own plan, General Growth would remain independent, with Brookfield as one of its largest shareholders. 
 The announcement is the latest escalation in the clash between General Growth and Simon. 
 Simon, in its statement, derided General Growth's plan as ''a complex piece of financial engineering that is so highly conditional as to be illusory.''
 The proposal will also pit General Growth investors against one another. One of the proposal's main architects is the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, who sits on General Growth's board and owns big stakes in the company's equity and debt, but the company's unsecured creditors' committee has raised objections to the plan.
 It is unclear whether Simon will raise its offer, though it has been holding talks with potential partners like the Blackstone Group and sovereign wealth funds about co-investing in a joint deal, people briefed on the matter said.
 Under General Growth's division plan, the larger entity will keep the General Growth Properties name and its healthiest assets, including more than 170 malls like Faneuil Hall in Boston. Its stock will be distributed to existing General Growth shareholders, with an initial value of about $10 a share.
 ''This leaves a company that's easy to understand, with more stabilized assets,'' Adam S. Metz, General Growth's chief executive, said in an interview.
 The smaller entity will be named General Growth Opportunities. It will hold more troubled assets, including the Ala Moana Tower in Hawaii and the South Street Seaport in Manhattan. That business, which will be spun off to existing shareholders at an initial value of $5 a share, is meant to manage those properties until the economy improves and their value rises.
 ''G.G.O. has a lot of those assets in there that in the long term are going to be terrific,'' Mr. Metz said. 
 Underpinning General Growth's reorganization is a combination of investments from the likes of Brookfield and other debtholders, asset sales and a big issuance of new equity.
 Brookfield plans to invest about $2.5 billion to gain a 30 percent stake in General Growth Properties. It will also buy about $125 million of a $250 million rights offering to capitalize General Growth Opportunities, which would give it a 7 percent stake in the company.
 Simon, whose efforts at buying its competitor have been rebuffed, says its bid is superior. While it values General Growth's stock at about $9 a share, compared to the $15 a share under the reorganization plan, it is mostly cash. Simon has also offered to pay off General Growth's unsecured creditors, who are owed $7 billion, in full and in cash. 
 General Growth has pledged to do the same, though it may need to offer a mix of cash and stock, depending on the success of its capital-raising efforts. The company and some investors say that General Growth's stock will offer greater rewards in the future as the economy revives. (Mr. Ackman has projected that General Growth's shares are worth at least $24 a share.)
 General Growth announced its latest plan one week before a crucial hearing in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan over whether to grant the company a six-month extension of its exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan. If the judge overseeing the case, Allan L. Gropper, rules in General Growth's favor, Simon will face a higher hurdle in pressing its bid.
 On Wednesday afternoon, General Growth's unsecured creditors committee objected to that motion and criticized the reorganization plan as being ''lengthy and uncertain.'' Simon, which also holds General Growth unsecured debt, filed a motion supporting the committee's objection.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Bill on Job Creation

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In what Democrats hope is the first in a series of legislative victories, the Senate on Wednesday easily approved a $15 billion plan to spur job creation, a vote that lawmakers hoped would show that they were taking steps to improve the nation's employment outlook.
 The coalition that passed the relatively modest measure by 70 to 28 included 55 Democrats, 2 independents and 13 Republicans, a show of bipartisan consensus that has been rare on Capitol Hill in recent months. Democratic leaders said they hoped to follow up with other measures that would encourage small businesses to expand and would provide assistance to those who remain out of work. 
 ''This package is not a panacea; it's not going to solve everything,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate and co-author of the provision that gives employers an exemption from payroll taxes if they hire people who have been out of work for at least 60 days. ''But because we have a jobs agenda, not just a jobs bill, we will keep at it and at it and at it.''
 The measure now goes to the House, where Democratic officials have said they would like to move it rapidly to President Obama's desk to allow them to claim one of their first significant achievements of the year. But some concerns about the Senate version were emerging in the House about how the costs of the bill were calculated and whether highway construction money would be disbursed in a way that favored a handful of states represented by Democratic senators.
 The bill's costs also drew objection in the Senate, where Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, sought to block the measure on the ground that shifting almost $20 billion into a fund for road and bridge projects would add to the deficit over the next five years. 
 Democrats disputed Mr. Gregg's interpretation, but Republicans still accused them of breaking new budget enforcement rules just weeks after they were put in place.
 ''This bill is designed to preserve the jobs of members of Congress, not to help out-of-work Americans,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma. He said that little was known about the potential impact of the measure since it was never reviewed at committee hearings and that Democrats were blurring the fiscal impact.
 ''These kinds of budget gimmicks would send any businessman to prison, but in Washington it is common practice to hide the true costs from taxpayers,'' Mr. Coburn said.
 Other Republicans backed the measure, saying it was a reasonable starting point for getting Americans back to work.
 ''The payroll tax cut that is the centerpiece of this bill is a targeted, reasonable way to get employers hiring again,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a co-author of the payroll plan. ''This is a conservative approach to help put our economy back on track through tax relief, not more government spending.''
 Other Republicans pointed to the help for road and bridge building as a main incentive for voting for the measure. Democrats said the provision renewing and bolstering the federal highway program would prevent states from bringing projects to a halt and create as many as one million jobs.
 At the same time, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who has been taking political heat at home for his vote for the Democratic health care overhaul, was the sole Democrat to oppose the measure. He singled out spending as his chief concern.
 ''What I'm hearing from Nebraskans is that we don't need to spend more money right now,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''We need to give the stimulus bill we passed a year ago more time to work -- saving and creating jobs, and providing tax relief.''
 Late last year, the House passed a much broader jobs and economic recovery package, and many lawmakers consider the Senate initiative too limited to do much to revive hiring in parts of the nation that have been hardest hit economically. But the leadership in both the House and Senate say they intend to pursue a number of jobs-related measures in the next month.
 ''We're just getting started,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee.

GRAPHIC: GRAPHIC: The Senate Proposal: NEW TAX BREAKS FOR BUSINESSES: -Exempt employers from Social Security payroll taxes -- equal to 6.2 percent of wages up to a limit of $106,800 -- for hiring workers in 2010 who have been unemployed for at least 60 days. Provide a $1,000 income tax credit for new workers retained for a continuous 52 weeks. (Estimated 10-year cost: $13 billion) -Allow businesses to take an immediate write-off up to $250,000 for equipment purchased this year, rather than over a longer period. ($35 million) INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING: -Allows investors to claim federal subsidies -- generally equal to 45 percent of the borrowing costs -- for bonds issued for certain public works projects. ($2 billion) -Extend the Highway Trust Fund, which pays for transportation projects with gasoline and truck taxes, through the year. Transfer $19.5 billion in interest from the government's general fund to the Highway Trust Fund. (No revenue impact. According to Senate Democrats, the money would be repaid later and would not expand the deficit.)

HEADLINE: Google Stands Firm Amid Complaints in Europe

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Facing a new wave of antitrust complaints in Europe, Google stood firm Wednesday, saying it would not offer concessions to companies that have accused the Internet giant of abusing its market power in online search and advertising.
 Google said it was preparing a response to questions sent by European antitrust regulators after allegations from three companies, including a unit of its archrival Microsoft.
 But Julia Holtz, the senior competition counsel for Google, said, ''We haven't done anything wrong, so considering any sort of commitment'' in response to the complaints was unnecessary.
 ''We are very confident that our business operates in the interests of users and partners, as well as within European law,'' she said. 
 The complaints to the European Commission signal rising frustration among competitors with Google's strength in the online advertising business and with its business practices.
 In some European countries, Google has more than 80 percent of the market for Internet searches and advertising linked to them -- greater even than in the United States. European Commission officials had said in the past, however, that market dominance was not, in and of itself, sufficient cause for antitrust sanctions.
 Antitrust experts said that Google's decision to publicize the complaints itself -- on a company blog -- showed the company's determination to try to stop the case before it advanced any further.
 ''This is the time for Google's lawyers to be highly proactive, and to go with their knives sharpened and daggers in their mouths to try and kill the investigation,'' said Dennis Oswell, an antitrust lawyer at Oswell & Vahida in Brussels. ''Once these investigations in Brussels reach the formal stage, winning a case is more difficult, because the commission has made an investment at that point and there's an expectation that they should get something out of it.''
 The commission confirmed that it had received three complaints against Google and said it was examining them. It had asked Google to comment on the allegations earlier this month but has not opened a formal investigation for the time being.
 Amelia Torres, the spokeswoman for E.U. competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said regulators were ''still ascertaining the facts.''
 Google already faces an antitrust investigation in Italy stemming from complaints by newspaper publishers, who say the company unfairly hampers them from earning money from online advertising. Regulators in Germany are looking into similar complaints, and a government-commissioned panel in France recently urged regulators to begin a separate inquiry.
 Jesse Verstraete, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels, said it was ''natural for competition officials to look at online advertising given how important it is to the development of the Internet and the dominance of one player.''
 Mr. Verstraete said Microsoft was continuing to cooperate with the German government's investigation, which was sparked by complaints brought by its comparison-shopping Web site, Ciao!, as well as German publishers and an online mapping company.
 Ciao! originally took its complaint to Germany's antitrust agency and the case was transferred by the German authorities to the European Commission, Google said. The other complaints in Brussels were filed by a British price-comparison site called Foundem and a French legal search engine called Ejustice.fr. Foundem and Ejustice complain that Google plays down their sites in its search results, Google said.
 Ciao! was a ''longtime'' partner of Google's AdSense service, but only began to complain after being acquired by Microsoft in 2008, Google said. Its complaint relates to Google's terms and conditions, Google said, without elaborating. In Germany, Ciao! was complaining about a lack of transparency in how advertising revenue was divided.
 The Google AdSense contract with Ciao! expired last month and has not been renewed.
 Ms. Holtz said Google adjusted its technology continuously to keep users satisfied and to optimize its services.
 But she suggested that no changes needed to be made to the algorithm, or the underlying formulas that determine where a site shows up in Google search results, a main element of its search technology that troubles competitors.
 ''I would strongly refute that the algorithm does any damage,'' she said, adding that no one was being ''punished'' by the technology.
 She said that companies that felt they were not able to be found quickly enough on Google could consult guidelines for advice about how to modify their Web pages to enhance their online ranking.
 But Shivaun Raff, the chief executive and co-founder of Foundem, in Bracknell, England, said the company had been ''penalized'' by Google in several ways in 2006.
 She said her company, which provides links to the Web sites of online retailers showing competing prices of products, was moved down in the search rankings by Google's algorithm and its paid search service, AdWords.
 She said it took a year for Foundem to get reinstated on AdWords, and three years to get the search ''penalty'' removed.
 ''These penalties are indiscriminate, cause collateral damage, and once you have been struck by them it is almost impossible to get yourself out of them,'' she said.
 She wants Google to offer greater transparency and put in place a more responsive appeals process.
 ''It is the small, innovative companies that are being hit hardest by these penalties,'' she said. ''It all adds up to an unassailable competitive advantage for Google.''
 Google says its algorithm favors sites that display original content over those that primarily provide links to other sites.
 But Foundem also has another complaint. It says Google is using its so-called universal search technology as a way to favor Google's own services like maps, news, YouTube, and search services for books and other products.
 ''Competitors across multiple markets are being crushed by this tool,'' Ms. Raff said, ''and that will potentially stifle innovation across the entire Internet.'' 
 Over the past decade, European regulators have fined other U.S. technology giants like Microsoft and Intel billions of dollars for violating antitrust laws, sometimes prompting anger in Washington.
 Speaking last week in Paris, Mr. Almunia, the new European competition commissioner, said he would strive to coordinate antitrust policy with his American counterparts wherever possible to avoid conflicts over how companies should be regulated in the Internet era.
 Christine A. Varney, the head of the antitrust division at the U.S. Justice Department, speaking at the same event, nonetheless warned European regulators to limit the obligations imposed on U.S. companies that were doing business globally.
 On its corporate Web site, Google said it was ''not surprisingly'' facing more questions as it had grown. 
 The question the complaints ''ultimately pose is whether Google is doing anything to choke off competition or hurt our users and partners,'' the company said, adding that ''this was not the case.''

HEADLINE: Today's Reversal vs. Dot-Com Bust

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and AGNES CRANE

 BODY:
The recent financial crisis was the worst in a generation -- unless you were an American investment banker. Wall Street certainly took its lumps: some banks failed and the survivors slashed thousands of jobs. Even with the collapses of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, though, the finance industry laid off fewer people than it did after the dot-com crash. 
 Employment in the securities industry fell by just under 79,000 positions from the peak in June 2008 to last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's no small number. But it's actually 14,000 shy of the number of jobs lost during the rout of March 2001 to October 2003 that followed the burst of the dot-com bubble. 
 In New York City alone, industry employment fell by about 30,000 from August 2007 to last November. But in the 28 months after the top of Wall Street's previous boom in December 2000, a third more were handed pink slips. 
 There are a few explanations for Wall Street's surprising resistance this time around. For one, fewer of the industry's businesses hit the skids as hard and for as long. 
 In the dot-com era, for example, underwriting was staffed to cope with dozens of big stock offerings a week. The crash ended that instantly. In the more recent boom, markets rarely got that frenetic. And last year's bank capital-raising bonanza kept Wall Street busy, even if banks were frequently selling their own securities to replenish coffers depleted by losses their bad decisions helped cause.
 What's more, trading desks have been kept vibrant by all the emergency programs the government put in place. These are also far larger businesses than they were 10 years ago, not least because there are thousands more hedge funds putting about five times as many assets to work. 
 Those who kept their jobs might not be as flush with cash as in the past. While bonuses are high relative to other professions, they've come down. Moreover, a larger portion comes as deferred stock, cash or both.
 Of course, more jobs could still disappear, particularly if draconian regulatory reforms are enacted. And at 16 percent, it's fair to say finance jobs lost in New York since the peak are running well above the national unemployment rate. But that may offer scant satisfaction to those convinced that Wall Street's gotten off lightly.
 Freddie's Dividend
 The bailout of Freddie Mac is certainly paying dividends. Taxpayers extracted a handsome $4.1 billion payout last year in exchange for their $51.7 billion of support since the 2008 rescue of the housing finance giant. And they're set to receive an even richer dividend from Freddie this year. But these pounds of flesh make little sense. 
 Sure, Freddie managed to get by without any extra public funds in the fourth quarter. A more hospitable market for mortgage-backed securities helped. But Freddie is far from done tapping government coffers. The Treasury's equity line initially was supposed to be capped at $100 billion. Yet the government was worried enough about the mounting losses late last year that it decided to give Freddie, and its onetime rival Fannie Mae, unlimited access for three years. 
 The support comes in the form of senior preferred stock with a 10 percent dividend. Yet, Freddie is still losing money -- taxpayers' money at that. Freddie gushed $25.7 billion of red ink last year. 
 If Freddie can navigate the worst housing market in generations without taking another dime from Uncle Sam, it'll still owe $5.2 billion in 2010. But that's an optimistic assumption. The delinquency rate on Freddie's $2.25 trillion portfolio is still rising. 
 Freddie should pay an onerous price for failure, just not while the government still needs it to help turn the housing market around. In that context, the current arrangement is illogical. Every time Freddie draws on taxpayer funds, it needs to use a portion of them to pay taxpayers their dividend. 
 The bigger questions for Freddie -- privatize, nationalize or run it down -- remain unanswered. Those will probably wait until a recovery is considerably further along. It doesn't mean, however, that the smaller issues don't deserve attention. The dividend that is only making a bad situation worse is one of them.

HEADLINE: The Transition Game

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
Christiansted, V.I. 
 IT is difficult to pinpoint the exact time that Walt Frazier's stylish alter ego known as Clyde more or less ceased to exist. But it might have been the September day in 1989 when Hurricane Hugo threatened to do away with both.
 Mr. Frazier, a Hall of Fame player for the New York Knicks basketball team, was relaxing on the living room sofa with a girlfriend, watching football on television, when the first terrifying winds tore the awnings off his vacation home on St. Croix. The television went dark. The large picture windows blew out. 
 Mr. Frazier and his girlfriend scurried for the bathroom, where they spent the next 12 hours, cowering and praying.
 ''We sat there all night, in the dark, hungry and cold, water coming from under the door, the wind howling, hearing crashes sounding like freight trains running down the track and thinking, 'Man, the worst of it hasn't even hit us,' '' he said, showing a visitor the same cramped bathroom. ''All we could say was, 'Hold on, house. Hold on!' '' 
 Looking for a tranquil hideaway after years as a paparazzi magnet, Mr. Frazier bought the single-level home on a one-acre property for $215,000 in 1979, while visiting St. Croix with his 12-year-old son, Walter III. He was shopping for a condominium, but instead fell hard for a house on hilly terrain with four tentacle-like columns that reminded him of a space ship.
 Mr. Frazier still has an apartment in Manhattan, and indeed was there on Monday night as the Knicks celebrated the 40th anniversary of their 1970 N.B.A. championship at Madison Square Garden. But it is in St. Croix that he has invested much of his broadcasting earnings and put in countless hours of work. He now has a five-acre property with 10 houses, a slice of Caribbean heaven that he believes will eventually net him millions. 
 From renowned hedonist to home-building horticulturist, he described the personal gain as priceless. ''I remember Dave DeBusschere and the other guys on the team used to say that I would have the toughest transition to make going into retirement because of being Clyde and coming down from all that,'' Mr. Frazier said, recalling the days when his wide-brim hats and flashy suits inspired comparisons to the Warren Beatty character in the 1967 film ''Bonnie and Clyde.'' 
 ''It didn't happen right away, and it wasn't easy,'' he added. ''But I was fed up with New York and that scene, the nightclubs and the cars. I didn't want to vegetate as Clyde. I was searching for something. I didn't know what it was until I came here.''
 It took a decade to discover that paradise had a dark side. Hugo wrought more than $1 billion in damage on St. Croix, the largest of the United States Virgin Islands, and nearly destroyed Mr. Frazier's home. When he emerged from the bathroom in the morning, with just enough room to sidestep the refrigerator that had hurtled from the kitchen, he was relieved to find the concrete roof intact. But the rooms were flooded. The furniture was destroyed. The property was a shambles. 
 ''Glass everywhere, things torn apart, lawn mower in the pool,'' he said. 
 Within nature's mess was one small miracle. Blown out from the living room to the edge of the pool was Mr. Frazier's wallet -- money and credit cards snug in the fold. He took it as a sign to stay on, and keep spending.
 Sleeping in the bathroom for weeks to avoid the mosquitoes in the house, Mr. Frazier shopped for new windows, replaced fixtures and weatherproofed the exterior. While securing the house, he had the urge to expand it. When services on the island were restored, he hired a contractor to expand the living room, install a new floor and add a bedroom, an office and a bath. To his surprise, planning for the expansion and refurnishing the house gave him a purpose and validation he hadn't felt since he was at the peak of his playing career.
 ''I began to sense there was something for me to do here, and then I realized doing all this work was what was going to keep me young,'' said Mr. Frazier, who will celebrate his 65th birthday next month and remains fit and youthful looking, despite thinning hair. ''I look back now and I can see that I was going through a metamorphosis, a change for the better.'' 
 As part of his repudiation of the nightclubbing Clyde, he changed his lifestyle. The lifelong city dweller became a nature lover. He learned to sail, bought a boat and became a licensed captain. And he found the garden calling to him many mornings at sunrise.
 On a recent stroll down a shady path about 50 yards from his home, Mr. Frazier stopped by a trio of flamboyant trees, the first of hundreds of plantings and, not surprisingly, his favorite. In bloom, the bright colors mimicked Mr. Frazier's Manhattan wardrobe, which he still wears when he calls Knicks games for the MSG television network. 
 The clothes, he said, are the last vestige of Clyde. Mr. Frazier prefers to be in St. Croix, where he spends most of his time from May through September and usually one week a month during the basketball season. 
 ''I can't remember the last time I was in a nightclub, anywhere,'' he said. ''Here, I go out to eat, but at 5 or 6 o'clock. Everyone on the island will say, 'Oh, Frazier, the tree guy.' '' 
 As Clyde, Mr. Frazier owned a Rolls-Royce and wore full-length mink coats. On St. Croix, he drives a GMC light truck and wears a baseball cap, a T-shirt or polo shirt, off-white jeans with painter's pockets and worn Puma sneakers that still sell under the Clyde brand that Puma introduced in the 1970s.
 Patricia James, who is his girlfriend and helps him manage the property and rental business, said the style fits all occasions. ''We'll be going out to dinner, I'll have a dress on and I'll say to him, 'You're not going to change?' '' Ms. James said. 
 A self-described perfectionist, he is not easy to work for, she said, and Mr. Frazier agreed, noting that he once fired his son, whom he had hired to manage the property during his absences.
 Mr. Frazier helps paint the interior of his houses and is obsessed with touching up spots others miss. He chafes at the way his workers clean windows, considering himself a master of the squeegee. Outdoors, Mr. Frazier said, he treats his trees and plants with the same nuanced appreciation he had of his Knicks teammates when he was the playmaker, or catalyst, for their offense. 
 ''I can look at the palms, for instance, and if I see a certain twist, I know they need water,'' he said, lifting a hose to some of the many trees that bear mangoes, avocados, apples, coconuts and cherries. Mr. Frazier's lush property is irrigated by something rare on his side of St. Croix, the east side, also known as the dry side: a well. ''Around here, they told me it was like striking oil,'' he said. 
 An intricate system of cisterns that uses both the well and rainwater serves the 10 houses he has developed, 5 of which are currently rented. Before Mr. Frazier discovered water and his green thumb, his original house was surrounded by unsightly shrubs and weeds. ''I'd come back in May after the basketball season and see the red flowers on the flamboyant trees, and I'd immediately want to start planting more,'' he said. ''I found this gardener, and every morning I'd work with him. He'd pick, I'd shovel. He showed me how to plant. I look around now and think, 'How did I do all this?' '' 
 The more his property bloomed, the more Mr. Frazier wanted to grow. He bought surrounding half- and one-acre lots, most of which had small cottages he was determined to renovate and upgrade. The way he once read word books to improve his vocabulary for broadcasting, he now perused home and garden magazines. He attended home shows in New York at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and in Miami. He scoured outlets for furniture and became a frequent visitor to home appliance stores, buying fixtures for the houses and shipping them south.
 A tour of Mr. Frazier's property comes with a detailed history of his projects. The most recent one started as a deck. ''Then I decided, O.K., if I'm going to have a deck, I'll need a roof. Then I thought, why not put in a bar and entertainment center and make this a clubhouse?''
 Nearby, Mr. Frazier's builder, Michael Wynter, was measuring the area for the entertainment center he will build, with the help of an assistant. ''He comes up with the ideas, and I help them materialize,'' Mr. Wynter said of Mr. Frazier. ''He wants everything to be different and unique.''
 Mr. Frazier gives all of his homes names. He and Ms. James live in the Main House. Next door, he is putting finishing touches on Sea View, which has a deck with breathtaking nighttime views of the twinkling Green Cay Marina. There are also the Green House, the Pink House, the Island House, the Pool House, the Deck House and Sea Cottage. 
 In his newest houses, Mr. Frazier has embraced a Caribbean flavor, emphasizing decks and terraces, with outdoor cooking facilities and shower stalls. The homes are laden with wood and bamboo in bright, open spaces. He still favors mirrors -- years ago he was known for his mirrored bedroom ceiling reflecting a round mink-covered bed -- but only on sliding closet doors.
 Deanna Davick fell in love with the layout of the Pool House when she joined her husband, Peter Perendy, in St. Croix earlier this month. Mr. Perendy, a kitchen installer, took a job with a St. Croix company when his work dried up in Minnesota. The couple found Mr. Frazier's property through a local company, Calabash Real Estate.
 ''We've vacationed here for four or five years, so we're familiar with the island,'' Ms. Davick said. ''When we moved, we rented our house back home fully furnished. Thank goodness Walt had nice furniture.'' 
 Before the recession, Mr. Frazier briefly flirted with putting the entire property on the market, at an asking price of $5 million. He worries that the maintenance will eventually become too strenuous as he ages. He has no intention of leaving, though. On two empty acres he recently bought farther up the hill, he plans to build an open-air palace of his own, with views of Christiansted Harbor on one side and the Caribbean on the other.
 On his property, Mr. Frazier has created a number of places to unwind -- or as he said, ''just chill.'' Recently, Ms. Davick and Mr. Perendy were taking a stroll around the grounds, enjoying the evening sea breeze, when they came upon Mr. Frazier stretched out on the platform of his clubhouse construction site.
 ''It wasn't even 7 o'clock,'' Ms. Davick said. ''He was in a deep, peaceful sleep.''

HEADLINE: State Senate In Vermont Votes to Close Nuclear Plant

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
MONTPELIER, Vt. -- In an unusual state foray into nuclear regulation, the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 Wednesday to block operation of the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant after 2012, citing radioactive leaks, misstatements in testimony by plant officials and other problems. 
 Unless the chamber reverses itself, it will be the first time in more than 20 years that the public or its representatives has decided to close a reactor. 
 The vote came just more than a week after President Obama declared a new era of rebirth for the nation's nuclear industry, announcing federal loan guarantees of $8.3 billion to assure the construction of a twin-reactor plant near Augusta, Ga. 
 While it is unclear how Vermont Yankee's fate could influence the future of nuclear power nationally, the reactor's recent troubles are viewed by some as a challenge to arguments that such plants are clean, well run and worth building. 
 Vermont's governor, Jim Douglas, a Republican, said after the Senate's vote that he and other governors had met with Mr. Obama on Monday and that Mr. Obama had spoken ''passionately'' about the need for more reactors. 
 ''It's ironic that at the same time the president is advancing a strong commitment to nuclear energy, that we're taking a step in another direction here,'' said Mr. Douglas, who had sought to delay a vote until public outrage about several recent missteps at the plant cooled a bit. 
 In a small, ornate chamber packed with plant opponents, the Vermont senators voiced frustration over recent leaks of radioactive tritium at the 38-year-old plant as well as the collapse of a cooling tower in 2007 and inaccurate testimony by the plant's owner, the Louisiana-based nuclear operator Entergy. 
 Plant officials had testified under oath to two state panels that there were no buried pipes at Vermont Yankee that could leak tritium, although there were. No tritium has turned up in drinking water, but even plant supporters expressed dismay at the leak and the misstatements. 
 ''If the board of directors and management of Entergy were thoroughly infiltrated by antinuclear activists, I do not think they could have done a better job of destroying their own case,'' said one senator, Randolph D. Brock III, a St. Albans Republican who cast several votes friendly to the plant.
 In the hours of debate, one virtue of nuclear power emphasized by proponents at the national level -- production of electricity without emissions of greenhouse gases -- was hardly mentioned, even by supporters. 
 Entergy said in a statement after the vote, ''We remain determined to prove our case to the legislature.'' 
 Under Vermont law, any extension of the plant's license beyond 2012 would have to be approved by both houses. Unless the Senate reverses itself and the House also approves an extension, the plant must close by March of that year.
 All members of the House and the Senate are up for re-election in November, raising the possibility that a vote next year on the plant's fate could yield a different outcome. Democrats have large majorities in both chambers. 
 But the company faces a struggle in allaying the concerns of lawmakers and their constituents. In debate, senators cited estimates of over $1 billion for decommissioning the plant, although only about $450 million is on hand for the job. Tritium leaks could raise the bill, they said.
 Before debate began Wednesday morning, Entergy said it had instructed a law firm to examine the misstatements its officials had made under oath and concluded that officials had not intended to deceive the state. It said communications had ''led to misunderstandings,'' and a result was that ''the responses were incomplete and misleading.'' 
 Curt L. Hebert, a spokesman for the company, said that Entergy had put five senior employees on administrative leave and that ''all the discipline taken had financial consequences for the employees involved.'' 
 Mr. Hebert acknowledged in an interview that the leaks, the cooling tower collapse in 2007 and other problems had been ''almost a perfect storm'' for the plant.
 On Wednesday, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said his agency would investigate the issue of the company's providing false information to the state.
 The commission said the structure that collapsed, one of several cooling towers at the plant, was not required for the safe shutdown of the plant, but the distinction did little to buff the plant's image. 
 In a move that has also deepened public unease, Entergy has been trying to spin off the reactor and five others, including the Indian Point reactors in New York, into a new company that would borrow money to pay back Entergy and sell stock on Wall Street. 
 Many opponents in Vermont worry that this would allow Entergy, based in New Orleans, to avoid legal liability for any problems at the plants and that a spinoff could be detrimental to the state. 
 ''It's a dump job,'' said Nancy Braus, a plant opponent from Putney who watched the Senate action from a corner of the chamber. 
 In theory, the debate here was over the plant's reliability, an area over which the state has jurisdiction. Over all, the plant has run far more days of the year under Entergy than under its former owners, a group of local utilities. National nuclear specialists like Entergy are often viewed as having more operating expertise than local utilities, but in many cases they lack local support. 
 In their culminating vote, senators defeated a resolution that would have authorized the state to issue a certificate of ''public good,'' which would be necessary to keep Vermont Yankee operating. 
 Vermont got its foot in the nuclear regulatory door by getting Entergy to agree several years ago that its original certificate would expire when the original license did, in March 2012. A new certificate therefore requires approval by both houses.
 Some plant supporters have raised the possibility of a lawsuit should the two houses decline to extend Vermont Yankee's operating license next year. 
 But Christopher M. Kilian, director of the Vermont office of the Conservation Law Foundation, said that because of the structure of the law requiring affirmative action of both houses for the plant to stay open, a suit would face difficult hurdles. 
 ''There will not be an act of the legislature for anyone to challenge,'' Mr. Kilian said. 
 The controversy in Vermont is viewed with deep apprehension and some anger by the nuclear industry. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington, which normally makes the decisions on safety issues, is poised to give the plant 20 more years. Commission officials declined to comment on Vermont's action. 
 The last time a reactor in the United States was closed by a vote of the public or its representatives was in June 1989, when the voters of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District decided to shut the Rancho Seco reactor. The issues in that case were mostly economic; the plant kept breaking down, forcing the district to buy electricity from neighbors, and it had been shut from late 1985 to early 1988 for repairs. 
 Commissioned in August 1966 and given its operating license in March 1972, Vermont Yankee is one of the older plants in the American inventory of 104 power reactors. The oldest still running is Oyster Creek, near Toms River, N.J., which is of a similar design and opened in December 1969. 
 Oyster Creek recently won a 20-year extension of its initial 40-year license, although, to the anger of its opponents, plant owners announced a few days later that it, too, was leaking tritium.

HEADLINE: Obama Defends Policies In Speech to Wary C.E.O.'s

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama rejected assertions on Wednesday that his domestic program amounted to big-government socialism. 
 Speaking to a group of corporate leaders, he defended his spending, tax and regulatory initiatives as the natural response to a historic economic crisis.
 Declaring himself an ''ardent believer in the free market,'' Mr. Obama challenged a line of criticism that has fueled discontent with his presidency. The policies of his first year in office, he said, ''were about saving the economy from collapse, not about expanding government's reach into the economy.'' 
 The president's appearance before the group, an organization of the nation's leading chief executives known as the Business Roundtable, brought him to a skeptical audience at a time when he has been sounding more populist themes, attacking corporate greed, immense bonuses and Wall Street risk-taking.
 Mr. Obama used the encounter to make the case that his policies would ultimately help business by guarding against excess and making it easier to create jobs.
 ''We've arrived at a juncture in our politics where reasonable efforts to update our regulations, or make basic investments in our future, are too often greeted with cries of 'government takeover' or even 'socialism,' '' Mr. Obama said. ''Not only does that kind of rhetoric deny our history, but it prevents us from asking hard questions about the right balance between the private and public sectors.''
 In his address, the president argued that the current debate about the government's role misses the point. While business is primarily responsible for creating jobs and growth, he said, ''government has a vital, if limited, role to play'' by setting fair rules of the road, investing in infrastructure like roads and education and providing a social safety net for society's most vulnerable.
 Republicans derided Mr. Obama's remarks. ''The business community doesn't need another speech about how they can help promote economic recovery and growth,'' said Katie Wright, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. ''What they need is a policy agenda that encourages business to thrive, instead of an agenda that is hostile to the capitalistic principles that have made our economy the most productive and competitive in the world.''
 In 13 months in office, Mr. Obama has presided over a string of exceptional government interventions in the private sector, including the bank bailout that he inherited from President George W. Bush, the stimulus spending package he enacted and the partial takeover of the auto industry. His proposals to expand health care coverage and restrict carbon emissions have fanned concerns among some Americans about the expansion of government.
 In 2010, federal government spending will be equivalent to 25 percent of overall United States economic output, the highest proportion recorded in American history except for three years during World War II. Likewise, the $13.8 trillion national debt expected by the end of this year will be the largest compared with the size of the economy since 1948.
 Mr. Obama acknowledged the concerns, but argued that his spending programs were temporary emergency measures intended to avert a new Great Depression. Some people worry that they ''represent a lasting increase in government intervention,'' he said, ''so let me assure you, let me be clear, they do not.''
 But he fired back at critics of his plans to tighten regulation of the financial industry. ''We can't repeat the mistakes of the past,'' he said. ''We can't allow another A.I.G. or another Lehman to happen again. We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to make gambles that threaten the whole economy.''
 He added: ''There are lobbyists up on the Hill right now trying to kill reform by claiming that it would undermine businesses outside the financial sector. That is not true. This is about putting in place rules that encourage drive and innovation instead of shortcuts and abuse. And those are rules that will benefit everybody.''
 Noting the anger in America today, Mr. Obama said it was tempting ''to turn against one another and to find scapegoats to blame,'' something critics accused him of doing in his recent rhetoric about Wall Street. But he tried to address the executives' concerns about his planned tax increases on the wealthy and his intervention in compensation packages at firms that took bailout money.
 ''Most Americans, including myself, do not begrudge reasonable rewards for a job well done,'' he said. ''What's outraged people are the outsized bonuses at firms that so recently required massive public assistance. Once that money is fully repaid, I don't believe it's appropriate for the government to be in the business of setting compensation levels.''
 As for his plans to reverse the Bush-era tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 a year -- presumably everyone in his audience -- Mr. Obama said: ''I'm not doing this to be punitive or because I love paying taxes. I'm doing it because at a time of two wars and massive deficits, I can't justify continuing to give millionaires and billionaires big tax cuts.''

HEADLINE: Putin Seeks Energy Investments From 4 Russian Tycoons

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Four of Russia's wealthiest businessmen were criticized by Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday, accused of failing to properly invest in the country's energy sector. 
 Presiding over a meeting on the electricity industry, Mr. Putin said in a televised speech that the executives, known as oligarchs, had undertaken to invest in power plants some years back but were now trying to renege on the obligations, citing diminished demand for electricity. 
 Mr. Putin said the investments were still needed, as demand would grow eventually, and that the men had committed to making them and should follow through. 
 ''We were counting on the owners being responsible,'' Mr. Putin said. ''Unfortunately, far from all of them showed responsibility.''
 While the comments were hardly searing, anytime Mr. Putin publicly criticizes a businessman it is closely watched and parsed by the markets. In Russia, the consequences of falling from favor are great in an economy with weak property rights and a recent history of effective nationalizations. 
 The criticism was mitigated with some assurances of continued favor for the men -- Mikhail D. Prokhorov, Vladimir O. Potanin, Viktor Vekselberg and Leonid Lebedev. 
 Mr. Putin had sharp words for Mr. Prokhorov, whose business interests extend outside of the country as well. 
 A basketball enthusiast, Mr. Prokhorov agreed last fall to buy a controlling stake in the New Jersey Nets from the developer Bruce C. Ratner, and move the team to a proposed stadium at Mr. Ratner's Atlantic Yards site in Brooklyn. 
 ''He's feeling good on the economic level,'' Mr. Putin said of Mr. Prokhorov at the meeting held at a hydroelectric plant in Siberia, according to a transcript posted on the Web site of the Russian government. 
 ''He has money,'' Mr. Putin went on. ''And he's visiting different offices, and he came by mine not long ago. I have warm relations with him. He's looking for uses for his resources. But the obligations he took earlier, those have to be fulfilled.''
 At issue are investments by the oligarchs in electrical generating companies. Under the terms of the privatization, they were to invest in building power plants or refurbishing existing sites with more fuel-efficient turbines, Mr. Putin said. The men could be fined if they fail to invest.
 Then, in a comment ominous for its echoes of the arrest and imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man as owner of the now bankrupt Yukos oil company, Mr. Putin said reasons might arise to involve the prosecutors general in this dispute.
 ''There is a possibility,'' Mr. Putin said, ''especially if we are talking about technical safety'' at the power plant sites. The Sayano-Shushenskaya hydroelectric plant where he spoke was the site of 75 deaths last summer when a water conduit burst. 
 Mr. Putin's comments can have sharp effects on markets. In 2008, his criticism of the owner of the steel company Mechel touched off a 38 percent plunge in the company's stock, reducing the market value by $6 billion.
 Mr. Putin wrapped up his comments saying that he would prefer an agreement with the oligarchs on the generating company investment plans and adding, ''Let's not argue about this.''

HEADLINE: Finance Bill Compromise Appears Likely

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As part of an effort to save a financial regulation bill, the Obama administration is prepared to agree that an existing agency, rather than a new agency, could take responsibility for consumer protections as long as the regulators have substantive powers. 
 ''We think an independent consumer regulator, with rule-making and enforcement powers, is critical, and our position hasn't changed one iota,'' an administration official said late Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid disrupting negotiations over the bill.
 The official said the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, was committed to such a proposal.
 Mr. Geithner met with two senators leading the negotiations, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee and Senator Bob Corker, a Republican of Tennessee and a committee member, on Wednesday night in a last-ditch effort to arrive at a bipartisan bill. 
 Aides to the three men declined to provide details of their discussion other than to say they all hoped a compromise could be reached.
 The Obama administration last June proposed the creation of a new agency to oversee consumer financial products like mortgages, credit cards and payday loans, and the House passed a regulatory overhaul in December that included the proposal. 
 But the idea has met with resistance from some parts of the banking industry, and for weeks, members of the Senate Banking Committee had been deadlocked over the idea.
 The administration's willingness to consider a concession on the consumer agency was first reported Wednesday evening on The Washington Post's Web site.
 Mr. Geithner is expected to meet Thursday morning with officials representing eight major financial industry associations.
 ''He will stress the urgency of passing a strong bill that can provide certainty to consumers, businesses and markets -- certainty that is essential to laying a firm foundation for sustainable economic growth,'' the Treasury said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Tightrope Is Set for India-Pakistan Talks

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- The resumption of diplomatic talks between India and Pakistan set for Thursday comes at a critical moment, with the United States hoping that even a modest improvement in relations between the nuclear-armed neighbors could help the broader American military effort in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
 Yet achieving that is likely to prove a challenge, analysts say. Even as the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan were preparing to meet in New Delhi, the countries have squabbled over what would be discussed. India wants the agenda to focus on terrorism, while Pakistan wants to resume broader talks that broke off after the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, by militants trained in Pakistan. 
 There were signs of flexibility on Wednesday night. As Pakistan's foreign secretary, Salman Bashir, arrived in New Delhi, India announced that his schedule on Thursday would be broader than previously announced. Besides meeting with the Indian foreign secretary, Nirupama Rao, Mr. Bashir will also meet with India's minister of external affairs, S. M. Krishna, and the country's national security adviser, the newly appointed Shivshankar Menon.
 For India, which made the offer to start the talks, merely returning to formal diplomacy stirred domestic controversy as well as confusion. The offer underscored how advancing the Pakistan issue has become a personal priority -- and a political risk -- for the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh.
 Mr. Singh is credited for his persistent efforts to restart diplomacy, but his government has been criticized for shifting positions and failing to explain clearly to a public still angry at Pakistan over the Mumbai attacks why moving forward now is in the national interest.
 ''He looks at India in the long term,'' said Lalit Mansingh, a former top Indian diplomat. ''But, tactically, he has been unable to take the country along when it comes to specific issues like the dialogue with Pakistan. This is where political skill comes in.'' 
 ''To me,'' Mr. Mansingh continued, ''it is possible to explain this to the public. But it hasn't been done. That, to me, is the biggest weakness.'' 
 The volatility of the situation was made evident on Feb. 13, when a bomb exploded at a bakery in the Indian city of Pune, killing 15 people. The Indian authorities are investigating whether the attack was orchestrated by Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistani militant group held responsible for plotting the Mumbai attack, but no firm link has yet been verified. In the wake of the Pune bombing, opposition leaders in the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party demanded that India step away from the Pakistan talks -- a demand rejected by the government led by Mr. Singh's resurgent Congress Party.
 A former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, Gopalapuram Parthasarathy, said that by moving forward with the Thursday talks, the government was undercutting its post-Mumbai position of refusing to negotiate formally until Pakistan took concrete steps to curb domestic terrorist groups that focused on India. 
 ''Yes, you have to talk to a neighbor, but the question is: On what? And how?'' said Mr. Parthasarathy, known to be aggressive on defense and security issues. ''Believe me, the dialogue process is going to have a very thin membrane of political backing in India.''
 But other analysts say talks offer a chance to change the status quo at a time when tensions in the region are worsening.
 ''It is the right step,'' said Salman Haider, a former Indian foreign secretary. ''There's no other way that India and Pakistan can address their issues. This can only fester if they are unaddressed.'' 
 Before the Mumbai attacks, India and Pakistan had been engaged in a so-called composite dialogue structured to address disputes over a variety of bilateral issues, including water, trade, commerce and the pivotal dispute over the border region of Kashmir. 
 In 2007, Mr. Singh also had been engaged, through intermediaries, in back-channel negotiations with Pakistan's president at the time, Pervez Musharraf, in which the two men nearly reached an agreement on Kashmir. That process was suspended in 2008 as Mr. Musharraf fell from power.
 Few analysts expect a substantive breakthrough Thursday, but the meeting may clear the way for a resumption of stalled broader talks. Mr. Singh's vision of India as an influential global player depends on sustaining high economic growth in the coming decade, which in turn depends on stability in South Asia, especially in relations with Pakistan.
 ''The prime minister is going out on a limb,'' said Ashley J. Tellis, a specialist in Asian strategic issues at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''There is no national consensus on resuming a dialogue with Pakistan.'' 
 From the vantage point of the Obama administration, Thursday's talks are a welcome development, though United States officials, sensitive to Pakistan's suspicions of both Indian and American ambitions in the region, are taking pains not to be seen as intervening. Washington wants greater Pakistani cooperation in fighting Taliban leaders hiding in the remote regions bordering Afghanistan. But Pakistani officials have often pointed to the diplomatic stalemate with India as reason for dedicating resources to the country's eastern border.
 For its part, India strongly supports the United States' campaign against the Taliban and is worried that Taliban elements could be brought into a power-sharing arrangement to end the war in Afghanistan. India's security establishment is also assessing the recent Pakistani assertiveness in arresting Taliban leaders. 
 Few analysts think Pakistan is responding to Indian demands to fight terrorism. Instead, Pakistan is seen as trying to position itself for when the United States begins negotiating an exit strategy from Afghanistan.
 ''The India-Pakistan dialogue is only a sideshow,'' said K. Subrahmanyam, a leading Indian strategic affairs analyst. ''For most Indians, the central issue is India and Pakistan. For me, the central issue is that the Americans are fighting the Taliban groups inside Pakistan.''

HEADLINE: Loan-Sharking Inc.

 BODY:
The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, signed into law last spring, was supposed to put an end to many of the deceptive practices that allowed credit card issuers to bleed customers dry. The most important provisions went into effect earlier this week, but credit card companies have already found ways to evade the law. Congress and federal regulators need to do a lot more. 
 For starters, that means creating a strong and flexible Consumer Financial Protection Agency that could react quickly to all-too-common scams and evasions. The bill that would create this agency has passed the House, but it is being stonewalled by Senate Republicans under heavy lobbying from the financial industry.
 Congress passed the credit card law in response to growing public outrage about deceptive billing practices intended to maximize penalties and fees and drive up interest rates. Constituents had seen their rates double without notice -- up to 30 percent or more -- even though they had paid their bills on time. Many were saddled with debt they had no way of escaping. 
 The law took several important steps. It required issuers to give customers 45 days' notice before increasing interest rates. It limited what companies can charge in upfront fees. And it outlawed the common practice of changing due dates from one month to the next with the aim of triggering lucrative late fees.
 Lawmakers and consumer advocates had especially high hopes for the provision that forbids companies from raising interest rates retroactively for purchases made in the past, except in a few specific cases. But a new analysis by the National Consumer Law Center, an advocacy group, suggests that companies may simply be rewording their contracts so that they can continue to collect retroactive increases by calling them something else. 
 Under some contracts, the center says, consumers are given cards with deferred interest plans that might never materialize or promised rate reductions that can be withdrawn if the customer pays even one day late. And the center found that some companies that prey on people with poor credit histories had reacted to the new federal fee limitations by charging interests rates of nearly 80 percent. 
 Congress cannot pass a new law for every new scam the industry comes up with. What the country clearly needs is a strong, fully engaged Consumer Financial Protection Agency that protects Americans from abusive, deceptive and predatory lending practices.
 Senate Republicans who continue to block this essential reform -- putting the interests of the financial industry ahead of American consumers -- should pay a political price for their misplaced priorities.

HEADLINE: Where 'That Is It' and 'Rewrite History' Still Resonate

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia 

 BODY:
The United States is not the only land whose hockey team made its citizens believe in miracles. Other countries have had their defining moments on the rink, when a victory became a communal celebration of nationhood its people will never forget. 
 And as Al Michaels's single phrase distilled the Americans' 1980 victory at Lake Placid, so have the key little phrases intoned by other television play-by-play announcers at the moment when dream became reality come to stand for an entire nation's indelible emotional experience. 
 Two of those announcers are here: Antero Mertaranta of Finnish television, who announced the Finns' gold medal victory at the I.I.H.F. world championship tournament in 1995, and Robert Zaruba of Czech television, who narrated the Czech Republic's Olympic triumph at Nagano 1998. 
 On Wednesday night, Mertaranta and Zaruba will announce the same game back to their home countries: the Czech Republic vs. Finland, at 7 p.m., local time. For one country, the chance for another miracle will end; for the other, the chance for a new miracle will live on.
 ''It was our only gold medal,'' Mertaranta said of Finland's victory at the 1995 world championship, made even more remarkable for having been won in Stockholm, capital of the archrival Sweden. 
 As the clock counted down to mark the end of the Finns' 4-1 victory over the Swedes -- the difference was provided by a hat trick from Ville Peltonen, who is playing for Finland here in Vancouver -- Mertaranta said a simple phrase that has become famous in his home country: ''Se on siina!'' It means ''That is it!'' in the sense of ''finally.'' 
 It is instantly and universally recognizable to Finns.
 ''No, I didn't plan it,'' said Mertaranta, 52, who works for the network YLE and is renowned in Finland for his original turns of phrase and across Europe for his excited rapid-fire delivery, which transcends the impossibilities of understanding Finnish among nonspeakers of the language. ''I don't think anything at all what I'm saying -- it just comes.'' 
 For Finns, the year 1995 contains a galaxy of associations, all linked to the national team's victory and what it meant to the nation. 
 ''It was a big moment,'' Mertaranta said. ''Finland had a very difficult time, really bad economic problems, lots of unemployment, and it was a big influence on the Finnish people. Thousands and thousands of Finnish people came out into the streets to celebrate. It had never happened before in Finland that we celebrated like that.''
 Nor has it happened since. The country was hoping for another celebration after the gold medal game at Turin 2006, but Finland lost, 3-2. ''It was disappointing,'' Mertaranta said. ''Especially because it was to Sweden.''
 Now, Mertaranta said, Finns were looking to their hockey team again. ''Maybe we have too much of a memory of '95, in both a sporting sense and a national sense,'' he said. ''But now for Finnish ice hockey this is a key moment because we have a lot of old players. This is our last chance.'' 
 In probably no country has hockey been so central to the notion of national struggle as it has in the Czech lands. 
 In 1969, mere months after Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia to crush the Prague Spring movement, the Czechoslovak national team met the Soviet national team for two games at the world championship in Stockholm.
 The Czechoslovaks beat the U.S.S.R. both times, even though the Soviets were at the height of their international hockey dynasty. Jaroslav Holik, Bobby Holik's father, covered the Communist star on his sweater's Czech crest with hockey tape and taunted the Soviet goalie after goals. Back in Prague, demonstrators faced the tanks holding signs that read nothing more than ''2:0, 4:3'' -- the scores of the two games. 
 The mood was different in 1998. The country was independent but was experiencing a national malaise after economic problems associated with the switch to capitalism and the split with Slovakia. But then Dominik Hasek, Jaromir Jagr and the rest of the Czech team beat Russia, 1-0, on Peter Svoboda's goal, and touched off a euphoric national celebration.
 ''It was something very special in the history of our country,'' said Zaruba, 43, who was calling that gold medal game over CT, the main Czech network. 
 During that game, Zaruba talked about the near misses at the 1948 and 1976 Olympics, when a single goal each time meant the national team had to settle for silver. 
 This time, a single goal would give the Czechs gold, so as time ran out, Zaruba said: ''Rewrite history! The Czech Republic has won Olympic gold, finally!''
 In a country where the very notion of history is so fraught, Zaruba's phrase, ''Rewrite history!'' became famous. 
 ''The whole country was crazy,'' Zaruba said of the scene at home when the Czech team won gold. ''Half a million people were watching in Old Town Square in Prague, TV ratings were so high. Now whenever anyone talks about sports success in our country, in soccer and volleyball and basketball, they say, ''We are living our Nagano.''
 On Wednesday, either Zaruba or Mertaranta will announce a game that will keep his country's hopes alive, while the other will have to say the words that disappoint his nation. Both hope it will be the former.
 ''We need something like 1995,'' Mertaranta said. ''Now there are economic problems all over the world. Everybody in Finland is waiting for something, some reason to celebrate, and ice hockey is our national sport.''

HEADLINE: For Workers at Closing Plant, Ordeal Included Heart Attacks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
The first to have a heart attack was George Kull Jr., 56, a millwright who worked for three decades at the steel mills in Lackawanna, N.Y. Three weeks after learning that his plant was closing, he suddenly collapsed at home.
 Less than two hours later, he was pronounced dead. 
 A few weeks after that, a co-worker, Bob Smith, 42, a forklift operator with four young children, started having chest pains. He learned at the doctor's office that he was having a heart attack. Surgeons inserted three stents, saving his life.
 Less than a month later, Don Turner, 55, a crane operator who had started at the mills as a teenager, was found by his wife, Darlene, slumped on a love seat, stricken by a fatal heart attack. 
 It is impossible to say exactly why these men, all in relatively good health, had heart attacks within weeks of one another. But interviews with friends and relatives of Mr. Kull and Mr. Turner, and with Mr. Smith, suggest that the trauma of losing their jobs might have played a role.
 ''He was really, really worried,'' George Kull III said of his father. ''With his age, he didn't know where he would get another job, or if he would get another job.''
 A growing body of research suggests that layoffs can have profound health consequences. One 2006 study by a group of epidemiologists at Yale found that layoffs more than doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke among older workers. Another paper, published last year by Kate W. Strully, a sociology professor at the State University of New York at Albany, found that a person who lost a job had an 83 percent greater chance of developing a stress-related health problem, like diabetes, arthritis or psychiatric issues. 
 In perhaps the most sobering finding, a study published last year found that layoffs can affect life expectancy. The paper, by Till von Wachter, a Columbia University economist, and Daniel G. Sullivan, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, examined death records and earnings data in Pennsylvania during the recession of the early 1980s and concluded that death rates among high-seniority male workers jumped by 50 percent to 100 percent in the year after a job loss, depending on the worker's age. Even 20 years later, deaths were 10 percent to 15 percent higher. That meant a worker who lost his job at age 40 had his life expectancy cut by a year to a year and half. 
 Additional investigation is still needed to understand the exact connection between job loss and poor health, according to scientists. The focus is mostly on the direct and indirect effects of stress. Acute stress can cause biochemical changes that trigger heart attacks, for example. Job loss and chronic stress can also lead to lifestyle changes that damage health. 
 Studies have, for instance, tied job loss to increased smoking and greater chances of former smokers relapsing. Some laid-off workers might start drinking more or exercising less. Increased prevalence of depression has been tied to both job loss and the development of heart disease. 
 ''We're just at the very beginning of studying pathways,'' said William T. Gallo, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hunter College in New York. ''We want to find out how we can intervene so we can lessen the effects of job loss, or eliminate them.'' 
 The anxiety among the 260 workers at the ArcelorMittal steel plant in Lackawanna, just south of Buffalo, actually began months, even years, before the company announced in mid-December 2008 that it was closing. Bethlehem Steel, the previous owner, had shut the main steel mill in 1985. After it shuttered the coke ovens across the street from the galvanizing mill in 2001, two workers committed suicide. 
 Bethlehem went bankrupt in 2003, passing the galvanizing operation on to International Steel Group, which merged with ArcelorMittal in 2005. Workers had been fighting to preserve their jobs ever since. 
 Even before the plant finally closed last April, Anthony Fortunato, president of Local 2604 of the United Steelworkers of America, counted at least a half-dozen workers who had coronary problems dating to 2006.
 A 2009 study led by Sarah A. Burgard, a professor of sociology and epidemiology at the University of Michigan, found that ''persistent perceived job insecurity'' was itself a powerful predictor of poor health and might even be more damaging than actual job loss. 
 Nevertheless, it was not until after company officials announced that the Lackawanna plant was closing that any of the workers actually died from a heart attack. 
 The news of the closing hit Mr. Kull hard, according to his family. He had always been a drinker, but now he was drinking almost every night and seemed depressed.
 ''He was going out and trying to forget about all of this stuff,'' his son said.
 Mr. Kull, who was 5-foot-8 and a stocky 200 pounds, had a history of high blood pressure but had passed his company physical the year before, including a stress test. On Dec. 28, 2008, he sat down to watch a Buffalo Bills game and have a few drinks. He got up to make dinner but collapsed on the sofa.
 Weeks later, his co-worker, Mr. Smith, thought he might have pulled a muscle while raking snow off the roof when he started having chest pains in bed. It did not cross his mind, he said, that he might be having a heart attack. He had no problems with his blood pressure, his cholesterol was low and he was in decent shape, often playing hockey with his boys on their backyard rink.
 But his wife, Kim, watched as he tossed and turned at night, fretting about whether he would find a job that paid as much as his position at the mills. When he was still feeling uncomfortable the next day, she made him see a doctor. 
 ''I think the stress just got to him,'' she said.
 Mr. Turner's wife, Darlene, noticed that he was smoking more after he learned about the plant closing. He was up to more than two packs a day, from a little over a pack. She also saw that he seemed to be laboring more when he exerted himself. 
 About the same time, they found out that her hours had been cut at her accounting job, to just one day a week. Still, he kept his worries to himself. At his funeral she learned from colleagues that he had been asking for Tums at work.
 ''My husband was the type of person that just kept everything inside,'' Mrs. Turner said.
 She came home on Feb. 13, 2009, and found her husband sitting on the love seat, his hat and gloves still on. 
 At first she thought he had fallen asleep.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Reassures On Rates

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress on Wednesday that the central bank did not intend to start raising short-term interest rates anytime soon, saying the economic recovery would remain halting for many more months.
 In presenting the Fed's semiannual monetary report to Congress, he did not waver from his recent statements on monetary policy. And the reassurance helped lift the stock market, even as a new report showed a drop in sales of new homes.
 It was Mr. Bernanke's first testimony since a grueling confirmation process ended last month, when the Senate gave him a second term as chairman by the narrowest margin in the Fed's history. 
 In what appeared to be a deliberate response to the criticisms leveled at the Fed, Mr. Bernanke announced support for two measures to improve oversight of the extraordinary lending programs the Fed started in 2008. 
 In one of the moves toward openness, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed would back legislation requiring the eventual release of the names of borrowers that used the programs. 
 He also said the Fed had undertaken ''an intensive self-examination'' of its regulatory duties, after years in which it had failed to curb some of the most excessive risk-taking by the banks it supervises.
 Members of the House Financial Services Committee seemed satisfied with Mr. Bernanke's message and tone. The hearing was much more placid than the raucous Senate confirmation debate, in which lawmakers assailed Mr. Bernanke for failing to foresee and head off the financial crisis and for aiding the Treasury's bailout of Wall Street.
 The twice-a-year report is intended to draw focus to the central bank's dual mandate: promoting maximum employment while keeping the inflation rate low and steady. 
 But many of the questions directed at Mr. Bernanke focused on the federal debt and deficits, or the difficulties small companies have had in obtaining loans and the bleak state of the commercial real estate market, areas over which he has little authority.
 In contrast to his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, who frequently offered his thoughts on fiscal policy, Mr. Bernanke tried to deflect efforts to get him to endorse either additional fiscal stimulus or prompt deficit reduction. 
 ''Obviously, unemployment is the biggest problem we have,'' he told the committee's chairman, Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''But there are difficult trade-offs that you have to make.''
 Mr. Bernanke also agreed with Spencer T. Bachus of Alabama, the senior Republican on the committee, that huge long-term deficits could not be sustained. ''In order to maintain a stable ratio of debt-to-G.D.P., you need to have a deficit that's 2 1/2, 3 percent at the most,'' he said referring to the gross domestic product.
 The current structural deficit, which government agencies estimate at from 4 percent to 7 percent of G.D.P., is unsustainable, Mr. Bernanke said.
 He added: ''It's not necessarily just a long-term issue, because it is possible that bond markets will become worried about the sustainability, and we may find ourselves facing higher interest rates even today.''
 Three hours passed without any serious effort by lawmakers to get Mr. Bernanke to specify when the Fed might start to tighten credit. Nor did they question the Fed's decision last week to raise the discount rate on loans it charges to banks, a largely technical but widely noticed step to normalize lending.
 ''Although the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as the expansion matures, the Federal Reserve will at some point need to begin to tighten monetary conditions to prevent the development of inflationary pressures,'' Mr. Bernanke said in testimony that accompanied the 53-page monetary report.
 Jeffrey A. Frankel, an economist at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the appearance had a reassuring effect. ''What he said probably allayed concerns that some segments of the market might have had about premature tightening of monetary policy,'' he said.
 Catherine L. Mann of the International Business School at Brandeis University said the biggest challenge the Fed faces is navigating the next financial bubble. ''Whereas they want to keep interest rates low to stimulate Main Street, the reality is that low interest rates are mostly stimulating Wall Street,'' she said.
 Moving from monetary to regulatory matters, Mr. Bernanke said he supported greater transparency for the special lending programs the Fed created in 2008 to prop up securities firms, money market funds, and issuers of commercial paper and student, auto and credit card loans.
 ''While the emergency credit and liquidity facilities were important tools for implementing monetary policy during the crisis, we understand that the unusual nature of those facilities creates a special obligation to assure the Congress and the public of the integrity of their operations,'' he said.
 He said the Fed would disclose the identities of the borrowers after a ''lag that is sufficiently long'' to avoid hurting the companies, undermining market confidence or discouraging borrowers. 
 Mr. Bernanke also said he would support audits by the Government Accountability Office of how the lending programs were conducted.
 But he defended the longstanding practice of not disclosing which banks borrow from the central bank's discount window.
 ''The reason is that banks will only come to the discount window in a period of crisis or panic, and if they believe that their names will be revealed, that would indeed, in fact, intensify the crisis or panic,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 During the financial crisis, the Fed helped arrange the sale of the investment bank Bear Stearns and the rescues of the American International Group and Citigroup. Those interventions are already subject to G.A.O. audits.

HEADLINE: Health Executive Defends Premiums

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A top health insurance company executive told a Congressional committee on Wednesday that higher premiums were justified by soaring medical costs, and warned that pending legislation could make the problem worse, further driving up costs for young, healthy people.
 The executive, Angela F. Braly, president of WellPoint, made the comments in testimony prepared for a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
 The hearing comes amid growing criticism of WellPoint and the health insurance industry by President Obama and Democrats in Congress, who say the proposed rate increases show the need for federal review and regulation of insurance premiums. 
 Anthem Blue Cross, a unit of WellPoint, recently informed subscribers in California that premiums for individual insurance policies would rise an average of 25 percent, with some rates going up as much as 39 percent.
 ''Raising our premiums was not something we wanted to do,'' Ms. Braly said. ''But we believe this was the most prudent choice, given the rising cost of care and the problems caused by many younger and healthier policyholders dropping or reducing their coverage during tough economic times. By law, premiums must be reasonable in relationship to benefits provided, which means they need to reflect the known and anticipated costs they will cover.''
 The increases in premiums are driven by prices charged by doctors, hospitals, drug companies and other suppliers, and by increases in the use of health care by an aging population, Ms. Braly said. 
 ''For 2010,'' Ms. Braly said, ''we expect hospital inpatient and outpatient costs in California to grow by over 10 percent, driven primarily by hospital reimbursement rates. Additionally, we expect pharmacy costs in California to grow by over 13 percent.''
 Ms. Braly said health care providers were charging more to the private sector, ''including our members,'' because payments from Medicare and Medicaid did not fully cover providers' costs.
 Families with commercial insurance pay almost $1,800 a year more for coverage as a result of this cost shift, Ms. Braly said.
 She criticized health care bills passed by the House and the Senate, with strong support from Mr. Obama. The bills would require insurers to accept all applicants and would require most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty.
 But Ms. Braly said the ''personal coverage requirement'' would not be fully effective, because millions of people would be exempted and others would make a ''logical choice'' to pay the penalty rather than buy insurance, unless they needed health care.
 ''The result,'' she said, ''will be a national health insurance market that is similar to New York, where the average individual market premium is over twice the average individual premium in California.''
 Ms. Braly said the legislation pending in Congress ''would increase California individual market premiums for the young and healthy by as much as 106 percent, before premium subsidies for certain eligible individuals'' are taken into account.
 Democrats have said insurers are raking in large profits while raising premiums. But Ms. Braly said profits accounted for ''a very small percentage of a member's premium.''
 Another witness invited to the hearing, Lauren Meister of West Hollywood, Calif., said she was told in January that her Anthem Blue Cross premium was being increased 38 percent, to $516 a month, from $373.
 Ms. Meister said she was offered the option of switching to a lower-cost Anthem plan that covered only generic versions of prescription drugs. But she said that was not feasible because she took several brand-name drugs for asthma. 
 In her prepared testimony, Ms. Meister called for more regulation.
 ''We saw what deregulation did to the cost of utilities in California,'' Ms. Meister said. ''We saw what the lack of regulation has done on a national level to our financial and banking system. Well, it's doing the same thing to our health care system.''
 Ms. Meister added: ''The City of West Hollywood, where I live, regulates how much landlords can raise the rent each year to keep rents stabilized. Why can't the federal government regulate how much health insurance companies can raise their rates per year, in order to stabilize premiums?''

HEADLINE: Like Rome Before the Fall? Not Yet

BYLINE: By PIERS BRENDON. 
Piers Brendon, a fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, is the author of ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire.''

DATELINE: Cambridge, England 

 BODY:
 VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN complains that he is being driven crazy because so many people are betting on America's demise. Reports of it are not just exaggerated; they are, he insists, ridiculous. Like President Obama, he will not accept ''second place'' for the United States. Despite the present crippling budget deficit and the crushing burden of projected debt, he denies that the country is destined to fulfill a ''prophecy that we are going to be a great nation that has failed because we lost control of our economy and overextended.'' 
 Mr. Biden was referring in particular to the influential book ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' by Paul Kennedy, a British historian who teaches at Yale. Published in 1988, the book argues that the ascendancy of states or empires results from the superiority of their material resources, and that the wealth on which that dominance rests is eroded by the huge military expenditures needed to sustain national or imperial power, leading inexorably to its decline and fall. The thesis seems a tad schematic, but Professor Kennedy maintains it with dazzling cogency. In any debate about the development of the United States, one would certainly tend to side with the detached historian rather than the partisan politician. 
 All too often, however, students of the past succumb to the temptation to foretell the future. For reasons best known to himself, for example, the eminent British historian A. J. P. Taylor predicted that the Second World War would reach its climax in the Spanish port of Vigo. Equally preposterous in its way was Francis Fukuyama's claim that the conclusion of the cold war marked the end of ideological evolution, ''the end of history.'' 
 When indulging his own penchant for prophecy, Paul Kennedy too proved sadly fallible. In his book, he wrote that Japan would not stagnate and that Russia, clinging to Communism, would not boom economically by the early 21st century. Of course, Professor Kennedy did not base his forecasts on runes or entrails or stars. He weighed the available evidence and extrapolated from existing trends. He studied form, entered suitable caveats and hedged his bets. In short, he relied on sophisticated guesswork. However, the past is a map, not a compass. It charts human experience, stops at the present and gives no clear sense of direction. History does not repeat itself nor, as Arnold Toynbee would have it, does it proceed in rhythms or cycles. Events buck trends. Everything, as Gibbon said, is subject to ''the vicissitudes of fortune.''
 Still, history is our only guide. It is natural to seek instruction from it about the trajectory of earlier great powers, especially at a time when the weary American Titan seems to be staggering under ''the too vast orb of its fate.'' This phrase (loosely taken from Matthew Arnold) was used by the British politician Joseph Chamberlain to depict the plight of his nation in 1902. The country had indeed suffered a severe setback during its South African war and its global supremacy was under threat from mighty rivals in the United States and Germany. Yet the British Empire was at its apogee.
 Paradoxically, the larger great powers grow, the more they worry about their vulnerability. Rudyard Kipling wrote this elegy to the empire, of which he was unofficial poet laureate, to mark its most spectacular pageant, Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897.
 Far-called, our navies melt away;
 On dunes and headlands sinks the fire;
 Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
 Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
 Aptly quoting these lines exactly a century later, when Britain gave up its last major colony, Hong Kong, this newspaper's editorial page noted that the queen's empire had been relegated to the history books; the United States had become the heir to Rome.
 Now doom-mongers conjure with Roman and British analogies in order to trace the decay of American hegemony. In so doing they ignore Gibbon's warning about the danger of comparing epochs remote from one another. It is obviously possible to find striking similarities between the predicament of Rome and that of Washington (itself modeled on classical lines, incidentally, because it aspired to be the capital of a mighty empire). Overstretch is common to both, for example: Rome defended frontiers on the Tigris, the Danube and the Rhine; America's informal empire, controlled diplomatically, commercially and militarily, girdles the globe. 
 But the differences are palpable. The Roman economy depended on agriculture whereas the United States has an enormous industrial base, producing nearly a quarter of the world's manufactured goods, and dominates the relatively new invention of the service economy. 
 Rome was prone to internecine strife whereas America is constitutionally stable. Rome was overwhelmed by barbarians whereas America's armed forces are so powerful as to prompt dreams of what is known in military doctrine as ''full spectrum dominance.'' Even in an age of terrorism and nuclear proliferation, it is hard to visualize an attack on America as devastating as that inflicted by Vandals, Goths and Huns on Rome.
 Similarly, the British Empire was a weak empire. It was acquired thanks to certain temporary advantages, and run on a shoestring. It governed the multitudes of India with 1,250 civil servants, and garrisoned its African colonies with a thousand policemen and soldiers, not one above the rank of colonel. The thin white line often broke under pressure. 
 Then Britain lost a whole generation of empire-builders during the First World War, and was virtually bankrupted by the Second. It was bailed out by the United States, which briefly sustained the British Empire as an auxiliary in the cold war. But its status as no more than a client was amply demonstrated in 1956, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower cracked the whip and stopped the Anglo-French invasion of Suez. The empire was quickly dismembered, its ghost surviving as the Commonwealth.
 Stemming from a tiny island, the British Empire was once described as an oak tree in a plant pot. American dominion, by contrast, is rooted in a bountiful continent. But does not the organic metaphor imply that states, like other living things, will inevitably deteriorate and die? This suggestion was convincingly denied by Lord Palmerston, the champion of the Victorian ''gunboat diplomacy'' that brought China to its knees. To compare that country to a sick man or an old tree was an ''utterly unphilosophical mistake,'' he said, since a nation could adopt mechanical means of self-renovation. This, needless to say, China has done.
 Despite its grave problems, there are some relatively simple steps America could take to recover its position. It could bring its military commitments into line with its resources, rely more on the ''soft power'' of diplomacy and economic engagement and, as George Washington said, take advantage of its geographically detached situation to ''defy material injury from external annoyance.'' Such a policy would permit more investment in productive enterprise and pay for butter as well as guns, thus vindicating Joe Biden's faith in the recuperative capacities of the Great Republic.
 On the other hand, Paul Kennedy may well be right to predict that the United States will shrink relatively in wealth, and therefore power, as its Asian and European rivals grow. Such contractions can be traumatic, as suggested by the experience of Britain, which, as Adlai Stevenson said, lost an empire without finding a role. 
 However, the British now tend to echo the historian Lord Macaulay, who said that the end of their physical empire would be the proudest day in their history if they left behind ''the imperishable empire'' of their arts and their morals, their literature and their laws. In other words, national self-esteem should not stem from global might but from cultural values and achievements. Faced by the prospect of decline, Americans could hardly do better than to cling to the noblest traditions of their own civilization.

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed essay on Thursday, about the decline of nations, misidentified the source of the observation that Britain had lost an empire without finding a role. It was Dean Acheson, not Adlai Stevenson.

HEADLINE: Balancing Act for India as Talks With Pakistan Resume

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- The resumption of diplomatic talks between India and Pakistan on Thursday comes at a critical moment, with the United States hoping that even a modest improvement in relations between the nuclear-armed neighbors could help the broader American military effort in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
 Yet achieving that is likely to prove a challenge, analysts say. Even as the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan were preparing to meet in New Delhi, the countries have squabbled over what would be discussed. India wants the agenda to focus on terrorism, while Pakistan wants to resume talks on broader engagement that broke off after the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, by militants trained in Pakistan.
There were signs of flexibility on Wednesday night. As Pakistan's foreign secretary, Salman Bashir, arrived in New Delhi, India announced that his schedule on Thursday would be broader than previously announced. Besides meeting with the Indian foreign secretary, Nirupama Rao, Mr. Bashir will also meeting with India's minister of external affairs, S. M. Krishna, and the country's national security adviser, the newly appointed Shivshankar Menon.
 For India, which made the offer to start the talks, merely returning to formal diplomacy stirred domestic controversy as well as confusion. The offer underscored how advancing the Pakistan issue has become a personal priority -- and a political risk -- for the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh. 
 Mr. Singh is credited for his persistent efforts to restart diplomacy, but his government has been criticized for shifting positions and failing to explain clearly to a public still angry at Pakistan over the Mumbai attacks why moving forward now is in the national interest.
 ''He looks at India in the long term,'' said Lalit Mansingh, a former top Indian diplomat. ''But, tactically, he has been unable to take the country along when it comes to specific issues like the dialogue with Pakistan. This is where political skill comes in.''
 ''To me,'' Mr. Mansingh continued, ''it is possible to explain this to the public. But it hasn't been done. That, to me, is the biggest weakness.''
 The volatility of the situation was made evident on Feb. 13, when a bomb exploded at a bakery in the Indian city of Pune, killing 15 people. Indian authorities are investigating whether the attack was orchestrated by Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistani militant group held responsible for plotting the Mumbai attack, but no firm link has yet been verified. In the wake of the Pune bombing, opposition leaders in the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party demanded that India step away from the Pakistan talks -- a demand rejected by the government led by Mr. Singh's resurgent Congress Party.
 A former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, Gopalapuram Parthasarathy, said that by moving forward with the Thursday talks, the government was undercutting its post-Mumbai position of refusing to negotiate formally until Pakistan took concrete steps to curb domestic terror groups that focus on India. He said that India's home minister had been scheduled to discuss terrorism with Pakistani officials on the sidelines of an upcoming conference, but those narrower discussions were now pre-empted.
 ''Yes, you have to talk to a neighbor, but the question is: On what? And how?'' said Mr. Parthasarathy, known as aggressive on defense and security issues. ''Believe me, the dialogue process is going to have a very thin membrane of political backing in India.''
 But other analysts say talks offer a chance to change the status quo at a time when tensions in the region are worsening.
 ''It is the right step,'' said Salman Haider, a former Indian foreign secretary. ''There's no other way that India and Pakistan can address their issues. This can only fester if they are unaddressed.''
 Prior to the Mumbai attacks, India and Pakistan had been engaged in a so-called ''composite dialogue'' structured to address disputes over a range of bilateral issues, including water, trade, commerce and the pivotal dispute over the border region of Kashmir.
 In 2007, Mr. Singh also had been engaged, through intermediaries, in back-channel negotiations with Pakistan's president at the time, Pervez Musharraf, in which the two men nearly reached an agreement on Kashmir. That process was suspended in 2008 as Mr. Musharraf fell from power.
 Few analysts expect a substantive breakthrough on Thursday, but the meeting may clear the way for a resumption of the stalled broader talks. Mr. Singh's vision of India as an influential global player depends on sustaining high economic growth in the coming decade, which in turn depends on stability in South Asia, especially in relations with Pakistan.
 During the past year, Mr. Singh has repeatedly tried to keep the door open to Pakistan, though in doing so he has opened his government to criticism. Last year, after meeting with Pakistan's prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, on the sidelines of a regional summit meeting in Egypt, Mr. Singh signed a joint statement that caused a political uproar by alluding to Indian involvement in the Pakistani region of Baluchistan and suggesting that future talks would not be linked to Pakistani progress on terrorism.
 Mr. Singh had to backtrack in a speech before the Indian Parliament. Now, having navigated that tempest, he has again pushed the issue to the fore.
 ''The prime minister is going out on a limb,'' said Ashley J. Tellis, a specialist in Asian strategic issues at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''There is no national consensus on resuming a dialogue with Pakistan.''
 From the vantage point of the Obama administration, Thursday's talks are a welcome development, though United States officials, sensitive to Pakistan's suspicions of both Indian and American ambitions in the region, are taking pains not to be seen as intervening. Washington wants greater Pakistani cooperation in fighting Taliban leaders hiding in the remote regions bordering Afghanistan. But Pakistani officials have often pointed to the diplomatic stalemate with India as reason for dedicating resources to the country's eastern border.
 For its part, India strongly supports America's campaign against the Taliban and is worried that Taliban elements could be brought into a power-sharing arrangement to end the war in Afghanistan. India's security establishment is also assessing the recent Pakistani assertiveness in arresting Taliban leaders.
 Few analysts think Pakistan is responding to Indian demands to fight terrorism. Instead, Pakistan is seen as trying to position itself for when the United States begins negotiating an exit strategy from Afghanistan.
 ''The India-Pakistan dialogue is only a sideshow,'' said K. Subrahmanyam, a leading Indian strategic affairs analyst. ''For most Indians, the central issue is India and Pakistan. For me, the central issue is that the Americans are fighting the Taliban groups inside Pakistan.''

HEADLINE: A Hospital In Harlem Is Studying Its Future

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Thirty years ago, it was the great hope for the future of health care in Harlem, a new private hospital, opened at a time when public hospitals were seen as failing.
 Harlem's civic, political and religious leaders fought, often successfully, to get more money and more state subsidies to keep it going. But in a time of economic malaise, the hospital, North General, at Madison Avenue and 122nd Street, may finally be on its deathbed, industry officials say.
 Like St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village, North General is trying to restructure itself to avoid closing and has reached out to potential partners and the state for money to keep going, the officials said on Thursday. 
 Its closing could be a boon for Mount Sinai, St. Luke's and New York-Presbyterian, other hospitals on the borders of Harlem. Although North General serves a large number of poor and uninsured patients, it is also perceived as a destination for middle-class Harlem residents.
 The industry officials, who insisted on anonymity because the plans had not been formally announced, said one possibility was for a rehabilitation center operated by the city's public hospital system to take over at least part of the North General site.
 Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, said that Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility on Roosevelt Island wanted to modernize its aging campus, which would be expensive to renovate.
 ''I can tell you that H.H.C. has had discussions with representatives of North General and others about the possible relocation of some of Coler-Goldwater operations,'' Ms. Marengo said. But she added, ''No decisions have been made.''
 After being asked Thursday about its financial situation, North General's administration issued a statement saying that it intended to continue serving Harlem, but acknowledging that the hospital was trying to restructure, and that it was examining a number of options, including sharing space and finding a partner.
 ''Like many health care providers, North General has to find ways to cope with dramatic changes to health care, state funding, the economy and our local area,'' the statement said. ''We are actively exploring the development of joint clinical programming with a number of local partners, as well as the utilization of available space for the co-location of certain services operated by other providers, to enable us to expand our health care services to our community.''
 Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group, said North General was among ''more than a handful of institutions that are facing serious financial problems'' across New York City because of the recession and because of seven successive state budget cuts to hospitals, with an eighth on the horizon.
 One of those institutions is St. Vincent's, which has been laying off workers and cutting salaries in an effort to stay open despite huge debts and operating losses.
 The industry officials said that after the state extended $9 million in loans to St. Vincent's over the last month, North General also approached state officials asking for emergency loans.
 A spokeswoman for the state Health Department declined to comment on whether North General had asked for money.
 The hospital has strong ties in Harlem. Its board chairman is the Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, who was out of town Thursday and could not be reached for comment, according to an aide.
 Gov. David A. Paterson steered state grants to the hospital while he was state Senate minority leader, and he came under fire for doing so, in part, while his wife, Michelle Paige Paterson, was employed as an Albany lobbyist for the hospital.
 North General has received significant state aid over the years. It has $116.9 million in state-guaranteed bonds outstanding, some of which financed the construction of its current building, which opened in 1991. The hospital made its most recent payment on those loans on Feb. 15, said Paul Burgdorf, a spokesman for the state Dormitory Authority. 
 If the hospital failed to pay off those bonds, the state would be forced to do so. The hospital also has $4.25 million in interest-free loans through a state revolving loan fund.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Rise; Unemployment Claims Climb

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
A lackluster report on durable goods on Thursday resurrected doubts about the sustainability of a recovery for manufacturing. In addition, the number of people filing unemployment claims touched a three-month high, and a barometer of home prices unexpectedly fell. 
 Orders for durable goods, items like refrigerators and computers that are expected to last three years, rose 3 percent in January. The Commerce Department attributed the gain largely to a 126 percent increase in commercial aircraft goods. A closely watched measure that excludes volatile transportation orders and military goods fell 2.9 percent, suggesting that businesses remained timid about spending.
 A separate report on the labor market on Thursday said that first-time unemployment claims rose much more than expected last week -- up 22,000, to 496,000 -- the highest level in more than three months. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected claims to drop by 13,000.
 A third report showed that home prices in the United States declined 1.6 percent in December, from November. The data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency suggested that demand for homes fell sharply in December.
 The data was in contrast to a 0.3 percent increase in prices recorded by the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index for December. That index focuses on 20 metropolitan areas, and it incorporates a wider range of home values. 
 Durable goods provide a snapshot of the health of the manufacturing sector, which is one of the few bright spots in the American economy. Manufacturing has grown faster than the rest of the economy in recent months, with a barometer of manufacturing activity reaching its highest level since 2004 in January.
 Cliff Waldman, an economist for Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI Economist, wrote in a research note that the durable goods data reflected the ''weakness and uncertainty of the nascent economic and manufacturing recovery.''
 Mr. Waldman noted that most of the gain was the result of an increase in transportation goods, and that machinery demand fell nearly 10 percent. ''It continues to be evident that business confidence in this economic recovery vacillates,'' he said.
 But James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global, said the mediocre data did not undermine a general trend of improvement for durable goods, though he said it raised questions about the rebound for manufacturing in the absence of government stimulus.
 ''The recovery in manufacturing is still well in place,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said. ''The only question is, to what extent is that sustainable, and that depends on whether you get a pickup in the labor market.''
 The Labor Department said on Thursday that the increase in jobless claims could be partly attributed to snowstorms along the East Coast, which caused a backlog at some offices. But some economists played down the effect of weather, noting that many people file claims on the Internet. 
 On Wednesday, the Senate passed a $15 billion bill meant to create jobs, partly by offering businesses an exemption from payroll taxes for hiring people who have been out of work for at least 60 days.
 Next week, the government will release its monthly unemployment report, and economists say they believe that the unusual number of snowstorms in February will distort the data. Analysts expect the jobless rate to climb slightly, to 9.8 percent, and job losses to total 30,000.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy for Paper Maker

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
The newsprint manufacturer White Birch Paper Company has filed for bankruptcy protection, citing declining demand for newspapers and the strength of the Canadian dollar. 
 The company's United States unit, the Bear Island Paper Company, filed a Chapter 11 petition in Richmond, Va., on Wednesday. It listed assets of $100 million to $500 million and debt of $500 million to $1 billion in the court documents.
 The parent company filed its papers in Quebec, under Canada's Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, in an attempt, it says, to preserve the value of its business and improve its capital structure.
 The Canadian companies are also filing petitions for protection in the United States under Chapter 15, which deals with cross-border insolvency.
 The company, one of the largest newsprint manufacturers in North America, is seeking approval in Canada and the United States for 140 million Canadian dollars ($132 million) in financing while in bankruptcy that it has already secured from lenders.
 The company operates one pulp and paper mill in Ashland, Va., and three in Quebec. It said it expected to continue operations as usual while it restructures under creditor protection.
 ''This process is about fixing our capital structure,'' Christopher Brant, White Birch's president, said in a release.
 ''The filing today is an important step toward ensuring White Birch's future as a strong competitor with a healthy balance sheet.''
 The filing comes at the culmination of a year of poor economic conditions that have significantly hurt the newspaper industry.
 Fraser Papers of Toronto sought bankruptcy court protection in June, blaming weakness in the pulp and lumber markets and a cash shortfall. The paper producer AbitibiBowater is also insolvent.

HEADLINE: China Warns U.S. Against Selling F-16s to Taiwan

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Zhang Jing contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- A top Chinese military official reaffirmed China's resolve to punish the United States over its decision to sell weapons to Taiwan and suggested on Thursday that there would be even greater consequences should Washington fulfill a longstanding request by Taiwan for advanced fighter jets.
 The official, Huang Xueping, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, warned the United States to ''speak and act cautiously'' if it wanted to avoid further damage to bilateral ties, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. Mr. Huang said that earlier threats to suspend military cooperation and exchanges between the countries ''remain unchanged,'' but he did not elaborate on what such sanctions would entail. 
 In previous statements, the Chinese government has said that it would cancel visits of top military leaders and retaliate against American companies engaged in weapons sales to Taiwan.
 In recent weeks, Chinese officials and editorials in the state-controlled media have been fulminating over the United States' $6.4 billion arms package for Taiwan, which would include Black Hawk helicopters, communications equipment and 114 Patriot missiles. Earlier this month a group of high-ranking military officers urged China to dump some of its holdings in United States Treasuries.
 The arms deal, announced last month but in the planning stages since the administration of George W. Bush, falls under a law passed by Congress in 1979 that requires the United States to make ''arms of a defensive character'' available to Taiwan. 
 China considers the island part of its sovereign territory and it warns that it would use force if necessary to prevent Taiwan from becoming an independent nation. The two have been rivals since 1949, when the Kuomintang forces of Chiang Kai-shek lost the Chinese civil war and fled across the Taiwan Strait.
 Mr. Huang was offering a pointed response to a new report by the United States Defense Intelligence Agency that described Taiwan's air force as nearing obsolescence. China fears that the report, portions of which were published by The Associated Press last week, will fuel Congressional efforts to sell the latest type of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan. Military experts say the F-16s will greatly enhance Taiwan's combat ability, and China has objected strongly to past sales of the jet to Taiwan.
 Speaking at a regular news conference on Thursday, Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, reiterated the official position that such arms sales threaten China's security.
 ''The people who tied the knot should untie the knot,'' he said of the recently announced deal.
 Despite the threats and angry words, many experts both in China and abroad think the present tempest will pass -- though the sale of newer F-16s could set off a fresh round of recriminations.
 After the Pentagon sold F-16s to Taiwan during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, China threatened to withdraw from international arms control talks. American military officials contend that the sale contributed to Beijing's decision to help Pakistan develop ballistic missiles. 
 ''If an F-16 sale moves forward, I think we can expect another wave of difficulties between the U.S. and China,'' said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of international studies at Hong Kong Baptist University.
 In one sign of conciliation, Professor Cabestan and others noted, the United States aircraft carrier Nimitz was allowed to dock in Hong Kong last week. During a similar dispute in 2007, China canceled a long-planned visit by the carrier Kitty Hawk, infuriating American naval officials.
 Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at People's University in Beijing, said the United States should pay a price for weapon sales to Taiwan, but acknowledged that China's umbrage was largely part of a show aimed at soothing nationalist sentiment, both in the military and among ordinary Chinese. 
 ''The domestic political climate is more complicated than before,'' he said, noting the rise in self-confidence that has accompanied China's economic surge. ''The current leadership has to hear all these different voices and to balance all these pressures.''

HEADLINE: Heinz Profit Falls 6% Despite Increasing Sales in Asia

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The food maker H. J. Heinz Company said rising sales in Asia's emerging markets helped its third-quarter revenue rise 13 percent. But the cost of selling frozen food businesses in the United States and Britain cut into its profit, which fell 6 percent. 
 Heinz, which makes Ore-Ida potatoes and Classico pasta sauce, as well as its namesake ketchup, benefited as consumers ate at home more often in the recession.
 But its sales in the United States fell for much of the last year, so it is marketing products more, developing new products and focusing on its emerging markets for growth.
 Its profit fell to $228.5 million, or 72 cents a share in the quarter, which ended Jan. 27, from $242.3 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 But the company earned 83 cents a share excluding costs related to selling the two businesses. That is a penny more than the company forecast and 6 cents more than the average prediction of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who typically exclude such one-time items. On that basis, Heinz earned 76 cents a share last year.
 Heinz, which makes an array of products, sold a frozen hors d'oeuvres business in the United States and a private-label frozen desserts business in Britain. 
 With sales rising 41 percent in Asia and 12 percent in Europe, the company's third-quarter revenue rose to $2.68 billion, from $2.38 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $2.66 billion. The sales increase in Heinz's Asia and South Pacific region was led by sales in Indonesia, China and India and offset by lower volume in Australia.
 The company's North American consumer product sales rose 7 percent, to $815 million, and its sales to American food service businesses fell 3 percent, to $355 million.
 Heinz said its growth in emerging markets was driven by nutritional drinks Complan and Glucon-D in India, ABC brand sauces and drinks in Indonesia and Heinz ketchup in Russia.
 Heinz reiterated its full-year earnings outlook of $2.82 to $2.85 a share from continuing operations. Analysts expect a profit of $2.84 a share.
 Shares of Heinz, which is based in Pittsburgh, fell 26 cents, or 0.57 percent, to close at $45.66 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: House Panel Admonishes Rangel for Taking Trips as Gifts

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and CARL HULSE; Eric Lipton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The House ethics committee said on Thursday that it had admonished Representative Charles B. Rangel for violating Congressional gift rules by accepting corporate-sponsored trips to the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008. 
 But the ethics panel, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, did not issue findings in its continuing inquiries into more serious matters concerning Mr. Rangel's fund-raising, his failure to pay federal taxes on rental income from a Dominican villa, and his use of four rent-stabilized apartments provided by a Manhattan real estate developer.
 Mr. Rangel, a Harlem Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, was one of five members of the Congressional Black Caucus who accepted trips to attend business seminars in Antigua and Barbuda and in St. Maarten organized by the Carib News Foundation, a charity affiliated with a Caribbean-focused newspaper in New York. But the conventions had been underwritten by corporations like Pfizer, Verizon and AT&T, and that sponsorship was widely noted at the events, according to an ethics complaint filed by the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative advocacy group. 
 The committee's findings, released Thursday night, admonished Mr. Rangel, even though it said it had no proof that he knew of the sponsorships. But it held him accountable because two members of his staff knew.
 ''Representative Rangel was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff and the performance of their official duties,'' the report said.
 Mr. Rangel, in a news conference Thursday night, disputed the findings. ''Common sense dictates that members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing or mistakes or errors of staff unless there is reason to believe the members knew or should have known,'' he said.
 He also said the ethics committee bore some responsibility because it had approved the trips in advance. But the committee said that it had been given misleading information by officers of the foundation, and that it had referred their actions to the Justice Department. A message left Thursday night at the foundation's affiliated newspaper, The New York Carib News, was not answered.
 None of the other members of Congress on the trips were admonished because they did not know of the sponsorships, the committee said. But all were ordered to repay the cost of the trips, about $11,800 in total.
 The others were Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee; Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick of Michigan; Donald M. Payne of New Jersey; and Delegate Donna Christensen of the Virgin Islands. All five are Democrats.
 While Mr. Rangel characterized the report as mildly critical, it brought a quick response from Republicans, who have repeatedly called for Mr. Rangel to step down as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax policy. 
 ''In this time of great economic uncertainty, struggling middle-class Americans deserve better than to have a tax cheat chairing a powerful Congressional committee that directly impacts the financial livelihoods of millions of hard-working people,'' said Ken Spain, the communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
 An outside watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it did not understand how Mr. Rangel could be rebuked while the other lawmakers were not.
 ''Each and every member of Congress present was equally as culpable as Representative Rangel, and all should be held to the same standard,'' said Melanie Sloan, director of the group.
 The ethics inquiry about Mr. Rangel began in September 2008, after reports that included assertions that he was renting four rent-stabilized apartments in Harlem at a price well below market value, despite rules forbidding House members from accepting gifts worth more than $50. 
 The inquiry -- which also included an investigation into whether he improperly used his office to provide legislative favors for an oil drilling company that pledged a $1 million donation for an academic center named for Mr. Rangel -- later expanded after questions were raised about unreported taxable income the congressman received from a villa he owns in the Dominican Republic.
 Mr. Rangel did not take questions at the news conference and did not respond to a question about whether he would step down from his committee post. There was no immediate reaction from the House Democratic leadership about the report. But the ethics finding comes at an important moment for Democrats, since they are trying to push ahead with their stalled health care measure and Mr. Rangel's committee would play a central role in the final process.

HEADLINE: Bringing Groups Together to Revamp an Industry

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ONE of the best-known slogans from the ''Mad Men'' era of advertising was for Certs, which declared itself to be ''Two, two, two mints in one'' -- a breath mint as well as a candy mint, that is. Decades later, the successors to Don Draper and Roger Sterling are trying to combine two prominent industry conferences into one big event.
 The two conferences had been for agency executives who worked on the management or media sides of the business. They were both put on each year by the Four A's, the trade organization formerly known as the American Association of Advertising Agencies. The management conference, more recently called the leadership conference, dated to 1917, and the media conference to the mid-1990s. 
 Last year, the leaders of the Four A's decided to merge the two, two, two conferences into a single event, effective in 2010. The first combined conference is to be held from Sunday through Wednesday, at a hotel in San Francisco.
 The rationale for the change was that it recognized how specialists in disparate areas -- management, media, creative, account planning -- are collaborating more often than before on producing campaigns for marketer clients.
 ''People used to be in a siloed mentality,'' said Nancy Hill, chief executive at the Four A's. ''In the last year, we've had a lot of discussions that it was time for everybody to find a unifying spirit.''
 Tom Carroll, the 2008-10 chairman of the Four A's, echoed Ms. Hill.
 ''The idea of having separate conferences just isn't reflective of the realities of the business today,'' said Mr. Carroll, who is also the president and chief executive at TBWA Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. 
 ''It's better to get everyone in one room,'' he added, ''because we all have the same issues and should be working together on them.''
 There is an efficiency aspect to the mash-up, too. The recession contributed to significant declines in attendance last year at both the media and leadership conferences. And a third conference that was to have been held in 2009, for account planners, was canceled.
 More than 900 people have preregistered for the conference, which Ms. Hill described as ''a pretty good number''; the final total may be larger because many members of the Four A's often register on site rather than in advance.
 The media conference last year drew about 800 people, compared with almost 1,300 in 2008. The leadership conference drew an estimated 300 in 2009, compared with 375 the year before.
 In developing the agenda for a combined conference, ''we said we can't just put the two together,'' Ms. Hill said. ''We wanted to make a completely different conference.''
 To that end, the conference is being titled ''Transformation 2010,'' and the Four A's put forth ''an open call to submit ideas for transforming the industry that could be presented at the conference,'' Ms. Hill said.
 Of the close to 100 people who entered, 8 were chosen to speak. Among them are Cecilia Gorman, vice president and director for creative services at the Young & Rubicam Brands division of WPP, whose duties include recruiting creative talent; Gareth Kay, director for digital strategy at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, owned by Omnicom; and Antony Young, chief executive for the United States operations of Optimedia, part of the ZenithOptimedia media services unit of the Publicis Groupe.
 As a signal that the Four A's hopes to cast a wider net than perhaps it had previously, not all speakers come from agencies that are Four A's members. For instance, Goodby, Silverstein is a longtime holdout against joining.
 Another way the Four A's intends to signal that it is not the Four A's of the ''Mad Men'' admen is a larger role for social media during the conference. There are plans for presences on Flickr and Twitter, live blogging by attendees and the uploading of video clips to the YouTube Fast Forward channel.
 And although Certs is unlikely to be present, another advertiser, Eastman Kodak, will supply small video cameras to ''roving reporters'' who will record portions of the conference.

HEADLINE: Robert J. Myers, Actuary Who Shaped Social Security Program, Dies at 97

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Robert J. Myers, an actuary who helped to create the Social Security program and to set America's official retirement age at 65, died Feb. 13 at his home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 97.
 The cause was respiratory failure, said his granddaughter Juliet Myers Wolfe. 
 In 1934, in the depths of the Great Depression, Mr. Myers was unexpectedly offered a six-week stint on the Committee on Economic Security, a Roosevelt administration panel that was drawing up blueprints for America's first comprehensive social insurance programs. 
 The six-week job turned out to be a career that spanned decades and placed Mr. Myers at the center of America's great debates about the government's role in the economy and how to create public safety nets affordably. Actuaries measure risks, and for much of his career Mr. Myers was concerned with the risk that the government might build an old-age program that promised more than it could deliver. 
 ''His name and career are inseparable from the history of Social Security,'' said Jeremy Gold, an actuary in New York who is active in the profession's intense, if esoteric, debates about how to measure the costs of an aging population. 
 Congress and the Roosevelt administration wanted the Social Security program to be self-supporting -- financed solely through payroll taxes and investment earnings, not general government revenues. Mr. Myers was asked to figure out the age at which people should stop working and start drawing benefits, to make the system pay for itself.
 His initial calculations showed that the right age was 67. By the time the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935, however, the age had been lowered to 65.
 ''Why is it 65? Why not?'' Mr. Myers wrote in a 1992 memoir, ''Within the System, My Half Century in Social Security.'' ''That age has been credited to -- or blamed on -- German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. In truth, he didn't do it.'' 
 Bismarck in fact selected 70 as the minimum qualifying age when he established the world's first social security system in 1889.
 ''Age 65 was picked because 60 was too young and 70 was too old,'' Mr. Myers wrote. ''So we split the difference.'' 
 Mr. Myers served as Social Security's chief actuary from 1947 to 1970, when he resigned in protest after publishing a signed article in Reader's Digest, warning that ''expansionists'' in government threatened to ''steer Social Security down a dangerously unsound financial course.'' 
 He said he thought civil servants in the Social Security Administration had become politicized and were colluding with Democrats in Congress to undercut the Nixon administration's initiatives. He considered himself a moderate Republican, but argued that actuarial science was supposed to be politically neutral.
 Mr. Myers served as a consultant to various federal agencies and Congressional panels until 1982, when he was named deputy Social Security commissioner by President Ronald Reagan. He resigned again in protest the next year, citing ''disastrous'' meddling by the Office of Management and Budget, which had proposed changes in the program that Mr. Myers thought would penalize the poor. 
 In 1983, he was made the executive director of the National Commission on Social Security Reform, a bipartisan body led by Alan Greenspan that sought to correct a severe deficit in the program, caused by the weak economy of the 1970s. 
 The Greenspan Commission, as it was known, recommended a number of measures, like enrolling federal employees in Social Security and taxing the benefits. Congress also enacted a minority proposal, to phase in an increase in the Social Security retirement age, so that Americans born after 1960 must now wait until they turn 67 to get their full benefits. 
 The changes helped strengthen the program in the short term, but by the mid-1990s the financial imbalance had reappeared. 
 When policy makers then began to talk about ''privatizing'' Social Security as a painless fix, Mr. Myers was aghast. 
 ''To me, the translation of the word 'privatization' is 'destroyed,' '' he told a Social Security Administration historian, Larry DeWitt, in an interview for the administration's archives in 1996. ''If it won't do it immediately, it will do it inevitably.'' 
 Robert Julius Myers was born in Lancaster, Pa., on Oct. 31, 1912, the son of Laurence B. Myers and Edith Hirsh Myers. He graduated from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa. 
 After moving to Washington in 1934 he lived at the Y.M.C.A. and met his wife, Ruth McCoy, known as Rudy, at a mixer with Y.W.C.A. residents. The couple married in 1938 and had two sons, Jonathan Myers of Philadelphia and Eric Myers of Wheaton, Ill., who survive him, as do three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Mrs. Myers died in 1995. 
 Mr. Myers thought that an accident of geography had landed him on the Committee on Economic Security in 1934. He had just received his master's degree in actuarial science from the University of Iowa, could find no jobs and had moved back home to Philadelphia, when he received a letter from a former professor saying that of all his unemployed students, Mr. Myers lived closest to Washington, where there was a temporary job for a junior actuary. 
 ''My principal qualification, therefore, was geography,'' Mr. Myers said, ''because most of the other students were from the Midwest.''

HEADLINE: Mexican Drug Kingpin Sentenced to 25 Years in Secret Hearing

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.; Rachel Marcus contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- One of the most brutal and feared drug kingpins in Mexican history was sentenced this week to 25 years in prison during a highly secretive hearing here that was closed to the public to protect the lives of everyone involved, according to a court transcript unsealed Thursday.
 Osiel Cardenas Guillen, the head of the Gulf Cartel, which controls much of the cocaine traffic across the border in South Texas, has agreed to cooperate with the federal government, according to the transcript. Mr. Cardenas pleaded guilty to five counts in a lengthy indictment, including drug dealing, money laundering and the attempted murder and assault of federal agents. He also forfeited $50 million in assets. 
 The sentencing took place in a federal courtroom in Houston behind locked doors and armed guards before Judge Hilda G. Tagle, who granted the government's request to bar the public. Only two members of Mr. Cardenas's family and a handful of federal agents were present. 
 Judges often seal particular documents in drug and terrorism trials to protect informants or continuing investigations, but it is highly unusual to seal a sentencing hearing for security reasons. 
 ''I apologize to my country, Mexico, to the United States of America, my family, to my wife especially, my children, for all the mistakes I made,'' Mr. Cardenas, 42, said in court. He added, ''I am remorseful.''
 Judge Tagle said people she had encountered whose lives had been ruined by the drug trade and the violence it generated had weighed heavily in her mind in deciding whether to accept the prosecutor's recommendation of 25 years.
 ''Kidnappings, extortion, gun battles in the streets, a desperate economy, innocence lost -- that is your legacy to your country, to our communities on both sides of the border, and to society,'' the judge told Mr. Cardenas, according to the transcript. 
 Before his arrest in Mexico in March 2003, Mr. Cardenas ran a small empire of drug smugglers and gunmen in his home state, Tamaulipas, moving tons of cocaine every year into the United States. Law enforcement authorities on both sides of the border said he was famed for vicious violence against his enemies and for recruiting former military commandos to serve as his gunmen, known as Zetas.
 Even from his Mexican jail cell, he continued to oversee the cartel's operations, law enforcement officials say. But in 2007, President Felipe Calderon of Mexico, having begun an offensive against drug dealers, broke with policy and extradited Mr. Cardenas along with 14 other major figures from the Mexican underworld.
 Since then, Mr. Cardenas has been cooperating with the United States authorities, as his organization has been weakened by arrests and by a lack of strong leadership at the top, experts on Mexican drug cartels said. 
 The Zetas, meanwhile, have broken off and became a separate criminal operation that now controls the lucrative crossing at Laredo, Tex. In recent weeks, there have been a series of gun battles between the Zetas and the remnants of Mr. Cardenas's organization in towns along the Texas border as they vie for turf.
 ''Ever since he's been in the United States, he's been cooperating,'' said George W. Grayson, a professor at the College of William & Mary who studies the Mexican cartels. ''He may be more inclined to talk about the Zetas given the hammer-and-tong conflict between them and the Gulf Cartel.''
 The sentencing and the two years of legal maneuvering before it were handled with the utmost secrecy. At the request of prosecutors, Judge Tagle sealed dozens of documents in the case, from those related to Mr. Cardenas's plea agreement to descriptions of his assets. 
 The final hearing on Wednesday was not even put on the court's docket until hours after it was over. In the transcript, the judge explained that the United States Marshals Service had asked to keep the public from witnessing the hearing because it would jeopardize the safety of Mr. Cardenas. The threat was never explained in court, and the affidavit requesting the unusual level of secrecy was itself sealed.
 Judge Tagle agreed to the request, saying there was a good chance, if she opened the hearing, that ''the defendant, court personnel, United States marshal personnel, other courthouse personnel and the general public will be placed in imminent danger.'' 
 Several experts on criminal law said it was extremely rare for a judge to bar the public from the sentencing of an organized crime figure. It is more often the case that a judge will seal some documents related to a criminal's plea agreement on the theory it could upend an investigation. 
 And in some cases, a judge will close a sentencing hearing if the defendant is going to talk about his cooperation with investigators. But even in cases involving terrorists and American mobsters, most sentencing proceedings are public.

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Requiring Lenders to Consider Changes Before Foreclosures

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The Obama administration, under intense pressure to help millions of people in danger of losing their homes, is considering a ban on foreclosures unless they have first been examined for potential modification, according to a set of draft proposals. 
 That would raise the stakes from the current practice, which strongly encourages lenders to evaluate defaulting borrowers for a modification but does not make it mandatory.
 Meg Reilly, a Treasury Department spokeswoman, said Thursday that the proposed foreclosure ban was ''one of the many ideas under consideration in the administration's ongoing housing stabilization efforts.'' The proposal was first reported by Bloomberg News.
 Laurie Goodman, a senior managing director at the Amherst Securities Group who has been highly critical of the government's modification program, said even if the proposal came to pass, it would not be ''a major change. We think there is a large public relations element to this.''
 The government could use some favorable public relations for its modification program, which has been deemed disappointing.
 Begun a year ago, the program was meant to help as many as four million homeowners but has fallen considerably short of those goals. The Treasury Department has said 116,297 loans have been permanently modified and more than 800,000 more are in trial programs.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association said its members were already doing what the administration was considering.
 ''Lenders generally go to foreclosure as a measure of last resort, after all other options, including loan modification, are exhausted,'' said John Mechem, the trade group's vice president for public affairs.
 Any enhancements the government made to the modification program would be unlikely to stem many foreclosures, said Howard Glaser, a prominent housing consultant.
 The modification program was designed for people who had subprime loans, he said, not for borrowers with high-quality loans who are unemployed. Tweaking the interest rate for an unemployed family does not provide enough help. 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association announced this week their own plan for reducing foreclosures: Lenders and loan servicers would reduce unemployed borrowers' payments for up to nine months while they looked for new jobs.
 The banking group said the servicers would need special loans from the Treasury to pay for the program. The administration has not commented publicly on the proposal.
 ''The real strategy in Washington now is to pray for an improving economy so these issues will resolve themselves,'' Mr. Glaser said. ''At the end of the day, a strong jobs market will prevent the generation of new foreclosures.''
 There was some positive news in that regard last week, when the mortgage bankers said the number of borrowers entering default unexpectedly declined in the fourth quarter. But on Thursday, the government reported that home prices sank 1.6 percent in December, a fresh sign that the real estate market is nowhere near healed.

Coke Now Adopts
 A Move It Scorned 
 The chief executive of Coca-Cola, Muhtar Kent, threw cold water on its archrival PepsiCo's decision to acquire its bottling subsidiary last year. So it came as some surprise this week to see Coke copying the transaction, with a takeover bid of about $13 billion announced for Coca-Cola Enterprises' North American bottling operations. 
 The about-face does not mean the decision is not financially and strategically sound. The 1980s-era smoke-and-mirrors trick of spinning off asset-heavy businesses to focus exclusively on its secret-formula concentrate is outdated. Nonetheless, Mr. Kent seems like a charlatan for so recently dismissing the idea after Pepsi beat him to the punch. 
 The numbers work for both Coke and its bottler. That is a bit surprising given they also did when Coke spun it off. Coke cleverly avoids paying cash for the assets it is acquiring. It will cancel its 34 percent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises, worth $3.4 billion, assume $8.9 billion of debt and absorb about $600 million of unfunded pension liabilities. 
 In return, Coke will get control of a bottling system that needs to adapt. The separation of the bottler from the syrup was applauded by Wall Street back when fizzy drinks were growing fast and the Wal-Marts of the world didn't have huge market share. 
 But consumer behavior has changed. American customers want a variety of noncarbonated beverages, like the Dasani brand of water and Powerade energy drinks from Coke, which the bottlers don't look after. 
 And more shoppers buy drinks at superstores, which are more efficiently served by fewer large trucks from warehouses rather than tens of thousands of Enterprises dispatches from bottling plants. While this will require retooling, Coke still says it can squeeze out $350 million of synergies. 
 So why all the glum faces from Coca-Cola shareholders? They sliced nearly $5 billion off its market cap. True, Coca-Cola Enterprises engineered a sweet deal. But there was only one plausible buyer for the assets, so it's hard to argue Coke was swindled. And Coke is paying about the same multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that Pepsi paid for its bottling assets.
 Coke investors may simply resent being surprised. While the company's reversal of a longtime strategy looks sensible, it came out of left field. Mr. Kent, and his predecessor, Neville Isdell, discounted Pepsi's deal. A chief executive who changes his mind shows either great intellectual flexibility -- or a tendency to waffle.
 Influence at the I.M.F.
 It's no secret that China would like to match its rising financial weight with a greater say in the institutions that oversee the global economy. 
 That includes a larger formal voice in the International Monetary Fund. 
 For years, China has been shut out of influential positions at the I.M.F., which is dominated by Western countries. So the appointment this week of Zhu Min as a special adviser to the I.M.F. managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a welcome sign of change. 
 China may have preferred garnering a more senior position. When Mr. Zhu was promoted to be a deputy governor of China's central bank late in 2009, the assumption in China was that he would soon become a deputy managing director at the I.M.F. (Asia's top job at the I.M.F. has long held by Japan.) 
 China may have unseated Japan as the world's largest holder of foreign reserves, but the fund's board doesn't appear ready to replace Japan just yet. This may be seen as entrenched interests resisting change. But it also reflects practical experience. When the I.M.F. last year expanded its emergency borrowing program by $500 billion, Japan contributed $100 billion before China committed $50 billion. 
 As an adviser, Mr. Zhu will not have direct influence in driving the fund's policy agenda. But he may have impact on the margins. He can offer guidance on how the I.M.F. can improve its bonds with Asian emerging markets -- a relationship that was strained when the I.M.F. doled out remedies during the 1997 currency crisis. As a former executive at a large state-owned bank, he has knowledge of China's financial system. 
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn has made it clear that he favors giving emerging markets a greater say at the fund. But he cannot change the balance of power overnight at the I.M.F., which has been the subject of protracted negotiations. Mr. Zhu's appointment may help speed up the process. But China is still some way from taking its place at the I.M.F.'s top table. ROB COX and WEI GU

HEADLINE: Merrill Lynch Guaranteed Ford at Least $2 Million a Year in Pay

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
As he flirts with a challenge to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in the Democratic primary, Harold E. Ford Jr., the former congressman from Tennessee, has been dogged by questions about his compensation on Wall Street, a sensitive issue because of taxpayer-financed bailouts of big banks during the financial crisis. 
 In response, Mr. Ford has said that he supports a system of pay in high finance that rewards profits and punishes poor returns. ''I believe that people take risk, and there are rewards if they do well; they should lose if they don't,'' he said in an interview several weeks ago. 
 As a vice chairman at Merrill Lynch, however, Mr. Ford benefited from an unusual arrangement that paid him generously regardless of how he and his firm perform. In 2007, he began working at the firm under a contract that guaranteed him annual compensation of at least $2 million, according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the agreement is confidential. With a bonus, his pay could well exceed that figure. 
 His guaranteed pay was twice that of the Merrill Lynch chief executive who hired him, E. Stanley O'Neal. Mr. O'Neal's contract assured him a base salary of $700,000, with the rest of his compensation not guaranteed, and paid out only as a bonus, records show. In some years that bonus was quite large. In 2006, for example, Mr. O'Neal's bonus was $18.5 million in cash and nearly $27 million in restricted stock, according to Equilar, a compensation-research firm.
 A Ford spokesman, Davidson Goldin, declined to comment on what he called ''speculation about a private citizen's pay'' and urged Ms. Gillibrand to disclose her pay when she was a corporate lawyer representing tobacco interests. 
 An aide to Ms. Gillibrand said she had exceeded all financial disclosure requirements as a candidate and as an elected official.
 Ms. Gillibrand has sought to portray Mr. Ford as a high-flying Wall Street executive who is out of touch with the needs of ordinary New Yorkers. In news releases, she has labeled his party affiliation ''Harold Ford (I-Merrill Lynch),'' to suggest his allegiance is to his employer, not to New York.
 It is a potentially potent line of attack because during his time at Merrill Lynch, the firm was allocated billions of dollars in bailout money from the federal government and became the subject of multiple investigations for failing to tell shareholders about generous bonuses promised to its employees before it was bought by Bank of America. Both the bailout and the merger with Bank of America occurred during the meltdown in the banking industry during the fall of 2008.
 Bank of America has repaid all the bailout money. 
 Mr. Ford has taken a leave of absence from the bank as he considers whether to make a Senate run, but he remains closely tied to the firm and its executives. 
 A telegenic young lawmaker with a wide network of relationships around the country, Mr. Ford was courted by several Wall Street firms after he lost his bid for the Senate in Tennessee four years ago. After Mr. O'Neal made personal appeals to him, Mr. Ford took a job within Merrill Lynch's client executive group, where he focused on bringing potential clients -- both wealthy individuals and corporations, especially in the technology field -- to the firm. 
 Mr. Ford's employment contract was modeled on that given to William J. McDonough, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who became a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch in 2006 (and has since retired), according to a person familiar with the matter.
 A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Ford's pay. Giant payouts are common in finance, and Mr. Ford's compensation is not an extraordinary figure in the field. But it is unusual for such a sum to be contractually assured to an employee, compensation experts said. Most of the eye-popping money on Wall Street is doled out in end-of-year bonuses, which are based on performance. 
 Mr. Ford has sought to play down the issue of his pay and has aggressively defended Wall Street, which he calls the engine of the state's economy. Shortly after he acknowledged his interest in the race, he criticized Ms. Gillibrand for twice voting against the federal bailout for Wall Street banks. ''How can you be against ensuring that the lifeblood of your city and of your state survives?'' he said.
 When pressed, he has repeatedly refused to divulge his pay, saying it is a private matter unless he enters the Senate race. Ms. Gillibrand's work in the private sector proved lucrative as well, but perhaps not by Wall Street standards. As a lawyer at Boies, Schiller & Flexner in 2005, the year before she ran for Congress, she earned $509,000.

HEADLINE: Democrat Seeks Part of Spotlight in Florida Senate Race

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Representative Kendrick B. Meek, the leading Democratic candidate for Florida's open Senate seat, listened quietly last week to tales of woe: a college student who nearly ended up homeless because her mother had lost her job; a laid-off mother who paid for health care with credit cards; an electrician struggling to get unemployment benefits. 
 ''Somehow in this campaign, I need to give you all some voice,'' Mr. Meek said. 
 He leaned forward at a cafe here, a 6-foot-4 hulk of a man with a boyish smile, and added that his Republican competitors -- Gov. Charlie Crist and Marco Rubio, the former speaker of the Florida House -- were too concerned with ideology, not action. And though he has served as a congressman from South Florida since 2002, Mr. Meek promised to help reform Washington, where now, he said, ''politics trumps public policy.''
 This is the core argument of a campaign that most Floridians have yet to see or hear. Mr. Meek, 43, has been a long-shot candidate from the start, but lately he has struggled to gain traction because of all the action on the Republican side. 
 Rubio versus Crist was initially expected to be a walk for the moderate, cheerful governor. Instead, it has become a grudge match over the future of the Republican Party. Six months before the Aug. 24 primary, each week brings another round of jabs under a national spotlight.
 A Quinnipiac poll last month showed the race essentially tied among registered Republicans, after Mr. Rubio -- a Cuban-American protege of former Gov. Jeb Bush and a favorite of the conservative Tea Party set -- had been down by 31 points in June when he joined the race. 
 The polls, of course, may not be destiny. In a state dominated by expensive news media markets, Mr. Rubio is still behind in fund-raising, with $3.37 million collected, according to state records, compared with $4.96 million for Mr. Meek and $8.99 million for Mr. Crist. 
 The challenge for Mr. Meek is that he is generally unknown outside Miami. According to the January poll by Quinnipiac), 72 percent of all those surveyed, and 60 percent of Democrats, said they did not know enough about him to form an opinion. 
 Many of his supporters say this can be solved by Election Day. They praise Mr. Meek as a methodical campaigner who is building his organization and visiting small gatherings all over the state. 
 The contrast between the parties' candidates looked particularly stark last week.
 While Mr. Crist was the host of a meeting about the state's space industry, and Mr. Rubio spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, earning a standing ovation for defending free enterprise, Mr. Meek spent the day on the road from Orlando to the Florida Panhandle, taking questions from voters struggling to pay their bills. 
 Former Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, who hired Mr. Meek as his driver when Mr. Meek was a state trooper in the 1990s, said that at some point, the retail politicking would pay off. 
 ''Kendrick's got it right -- let them fight it out,'' Mr. MacKay said. ''You don't want your campaign peaking too early.'' 
 Partly because the Florida Democratic Party sought to avoid contested primaries this election cycle, Mr. Meek now faces only one noteworthy opponent for the nomination, Maurice Ferre, a former mayor of Miami. And the challenge is limited: Mr. Ferre said last month that he had less than $60,000 in the bank.
 Mr. Meek said that without a bruising primary, he could deliver a consistent message throughout the race, and he has focused mainly on the economy.
 Like Barack Obama two years ago, Mr. Meek has pledged to fight for middle-class workers. He said he supported smaller government in theory, but he criticized conservative Republicans for attacking a federal stimulus that he described as necessary. 
 ''For anyone to stand up and say we don't need spending, we don't need help from Washington, that's contrary to what's going on,'' Mr. Meek said. 
 At several stops last week, Mr. Meek spoke in a soft drawl about working for tips as a skycap in college, about growing up with a hard-working single mother whose two former husbands were alcoholics. By virtue of his background, as a black former police officer, he said, ''I'm not a typical Senate candidate.''
 But by some measures, Mr. Meek is a political insider. He was 12 when his mother, Carrie P. Meek, was elected to the Florida Legislature, and 26 when she won a seat in the United States House, becoming the first black lawmaker to represent Florida in Congress since Reconstruction. 
 He started his own political career before turning 30, serving in the Florida House from 1995 to 1998, and joining the State Senate in 1999. In Tallahassee, the state capital, he developed a reputation for understatement and occasional boldness. In 2000, he staged a 25-hour sit-in outside the lieutenant governor's office to protest a proposal to eliminate affirmative action from state contracting and university admissions.
 Two years later, when his mother retired, he ran for her seat in Congress and won. Representing Florida's 17th Congressional District, which includes parts of Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, he now serves on the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 That makes him part of the Congressional firmament -- and vulnerable in the current climate of anti-incumbency, said Susan A. MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida.
 ''If you're in, people don't like you,'' said Dr. MacManus, who served under Mr. Bush on the Florida Elections Commission. ''There's a desire to wipe the slate clean.'' 
 Also, she added, the Republican primary may make the winner a stronger candidate.
 The larger question appears to be whether Mr. Meek can make his presence felt statewide. Though he has stepped up his efforts recently -- on Feb. 13, he sponsored a stock car in a Nascar race in Daytona Beach -- he continues to spend most of his time seeking out people like Omar Garcia, 33, whom he met at Barberia Latina, a barbershop in Orlando. 
 Winning them over, however, will take more than a just smile and a handshake. 
 ''That's the first time I've seen anyone of his caliber or his status come where we are and ask us what we think,'' Mr. Garcia said after the congressman had left.
 But, Mr. Garcia added, ''I don't know enough about him to say I'd actually vote for him.''

HEADLINE: Blackstone's Earnings Beat Predictions; Fortress Posts Loss

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The private equity firm Blackstone Group posted better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, driven by increased performance fees and improved valuations of its portfolios. Private equity firms suffered in 2008 and 2009 from sliding stock markets, which reduced the values of their investments, and from the limited availability of credit for new deals. But both factors have improved. 
 Separately, Fortress Investment Group, one of the world's largest publicly traded alternative asset managers, said its assets under management shrank by almost 1 percent during the fourth quarter as client redemptions totaled more than $1 billion. 
 Fortress managed $31.8 billion in hedge funds and private equity investments at the end of 2009, down from $32 billion at the end of the third quarter. The total was up 8 percent from the end of 2008.
 Blackstone said the value of its private equity portfolio rose 7 percent for the fourth quarter and 12 percent for the year.
 Despite a 31 percent drop in 2008, Blackstone's private equity portfolio is valued at 1.3 times its cost, it said.
 The value of its real estate portfolio dropped 35 percent for the year, but was about flat for the quarter, and is valued at around 0.9 times its cost.
 Blackstone's fourth-quarter economic net income was $329 million, compared with a loss of $764 million a year earlier. For the full year, that figure rose to $703 million, from a loss of $1.2 billion for 2008.
 On an after-tax basis, economic net income was 29 cents a share. Analysts expected, on average, 20 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Blackstone has had a difficult time getting out of investments by taking them public during the recent volatility in the markets.
 This month, Travelport, a Blackstone-backed airline ticketing company, called off its $1.78 billion listing in London, postponing what would have been the biggest initial public offering there in two years.
 Merlin Entertainments Group, the Blackstone-owned theme park operator that was talking to bankers last October, said it had no plans to go public soon.
 But one Blackstone business, Graham Packaging Company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 11, paving the way for a departure even though Blackstone did not get the price it wanted or sell the shares it planned.
 Tony James, Blackstone's chief operating officer, said that late in the year there was a sharp pickup in the number of its investments it has exited, such as through a sell-off or public offering.
 Mr. James also said that since the start of 2009, the firm bought back, amended or extended about $23 billion of debt in its portfolios.
 The firm said it would pay a quarterly distribution of 30 cents a unit. Shares in Blackstone, which is based in New York, fell 0.57 percent to close at $13.92 on Thursday.
 Fortress, which went public three years ago, posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $261 million, or 58 cents a share, compared with a loss of $426 million, or $1.50 a share a year ago. In addition to the fourth-quarter's redemptions, Fortress said investors in its hybrid hedge funds had asked to get $1.5 billion back. The level of redemptions contrasts with developments at other large hedge fund firms where pension funds and endowments began putting in new money this year analysts and investors said.
 Shares in Fortress, which is based in New York, fell 3.58 percent to close at $4.04 on Thursday.
 Hedge funds distinguish themselves from mutual funds by charging incentive or performance fees on top of management fees. Investors usually pay these fees only when a fund is in the black or after it has recouped losses from the previous year by reaching its high-water mark. Fortress said that many of its funds were not at that level again.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Cautions Senators Not to Curtail the Fed's Banking Oversight

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, urged Congress on Thursday not to strip the central bank of its power to regulate banks, warning that to do so would be a ''grave mistake.''
 Mr. Bernanke said the Fed would gladly surrender the authority it used in 2008 to arrange the sale of Bear Stearns and bailouts of Citigroup and the American International Group. But he said the Fed was uniquely positioned to provide ''strong, consolidated supervision'' of the biggest financial companies. 
 ''It's hard for me to understand why, in the face of a crisis that was so complex and covered so many markets and institutions, you would want to take out of the regulatory system the one institution that has the full breadth and range of those skills to address those issues,'' Mr. Bernanke told Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. 
 The Fed supervises 4,974 bank holding companies with $16.7 trillion in assets and 874 state member banks that have $1.7 trillion in assets. The central bank has acknowledged that it failed to tighten underwriting standards, which could have helped avert the subprime lending crisis and the subsequent recession. 
 In June, the Obama administration proposed consolidating some bank regulation duties, but leaving the Fed's powers intact. Similar provisions were part of the House version of the regulatory overhaul adopted in December. But several senators want to curb the Fed's oversight responsibilities and direct it to focus mainly on monetary policy, while putting a council of regulators in charge of systemic risk. 
 Mr. Bernanke spoke about regulation on the second day of his testimony presenting the Fed's semiannual monetary policy report to Congress. 
 He promised ''fundamental changes'' in how the Fed supervises the largest banks. He said the Fed was part of international efforts to toughen capital and liquidity requirements and ensure that executive pay did not encourage excessive risk-taking. And he said the Fed had begun a ''surveillance program,'' similar to the stress tests it conducted last year to make sure that the largest institutions had enough capital. 
 While admitting that the Fed had made errors in its regulatory oversight, Mr. Bernanke said, ''We were hardly alone in that respect.''
 ''A bank supervisor, which focuses on looking at credit files, is not prepared to look at the wide range of activities of a complex international financial firm,'' he said, arguing that the Fed's expertise in monetary policy, payment systems and macroeconomics equipped it to guard against systemic risk. 
 Mr. Bernanke has expressed support for giving an interagency council, led by the Treasury secretary, the responsibility for detecting such risk, but some Fed officials see that as too great a concession. 
 ''I believe that neither a systemic risk council nor a consolidated regulatory superagency will improve financial regulation,'' Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, wrote in a letter to senators last week. 
 And in a speech on Tuesday, James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said it was ''far from clear'' that a council could make quick decisions. He added: ''The Fed is also more politically independent than such a council could be.''
 Interviews with members of the Banking Committee showed it was unclear whether Mr. Bernanke's plea would succeed.
 Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he believed there was ''an emerging consensus'' that the state member banks had not been ''on the forefront'' of the Fed's attention and could be better regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mr. Bernanke, who opposes that idea, said in the hearing that small community banks ''provide us very important information about the economy.''
 Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, said that any regulator replacing the Fed ''would have to get up to speed.'' He added, ''He's admitted they made mistakes. My strong impression is they've learned from that, which makes it likely they'll do a much better job going forward.'' 
 Senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska, said he was ''very comfortable with the Fed retaining its authority,'' but added: ''I might be very lonely in that regard.''
 Mr. Shelby, who voted last month against confirming Mr. Bernanke to a second four-year term as chairman, said, ''The question before the committee is do we exclude the Fed entirely,'' or allow it to ''keep some type of regulatory authority.'' He said he had not yet decided. 
 Mr. Bernanke also told the senators that he would support restrictions on the Fed's ability to use its powers in ''unusual and exigent'' circumstances to bail out individual companies, as it did in 2008, for the first time since the Depression. 
 Mr. Bernanke said the Fed should retain the ability, in an emergency, to create the sort of extraordinary lending programs it set up in 2008 to ease liquidity for investment banks and prop up markets for commercial paper, money market funds and consumer, auto and student loans. 
 But as for ''any involvement in the wind-down of failing, systemically critical firms,'' Mr. Bernanke said, ''We would be very happy if you could find a solution that allows us to give up that authority.''

HEADLINE: Now at Northwestern, Ethics 101, Taught by, Well, Go Figure

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
James Warren is a columnist for the Chicago News Cooperative.
 Even if Northwestern University has used the title for a literature course, ''The Death of Irony'' must be revived for next week's campus appearance by the former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich.
Mr. Blagojevich is scheduled to speak at a gathering called ''Ethics in Politics: An Evening with Former Governor R. Blagojevich.'' 
 Many people gagged for all the obvious reasons. His alleged misdeeds, cavalier ways, narcissism, favor-swapping pragmatism and seeming belief that he'll be just fine if he corrals the news media to his side make him an atypical choice for presumably idealistic souls spending a king's ransom for four years in Evanston.
 ''But the problem goes deeper,'' said Rushworth Kidder, president of the Institute of Global Ethics. ''In a sense, he's the logical and inevitable outcome of a society that has refused to educate the next generation about values, ethics and character. As such, he's the perfect outcome of our ethical indifference and a role model for the next generation.''
 Mr. Kidder noted a survey by the Opinion Research Corporation last February, as Mr. Blagojevich was sinking into the impeachment mire in Springfield, asking youths ages 12 to 17 about ethics.
 Eighty percent believed they were prepared to make ethical decisions when they joined the work force. Of that group, nearly half said that lying to parents or guardians was O.K., and 61 percent said they had done so in the last year. More than a third of respondents thought that ''you have to break the rules at school to succeed.''
 ''Where does Blago differ from these kids?'' Mr. Kidder asked. ''That, of course, is the risk.''
 Paraphrasing the political sage created by the late cartoonist Walt Kelly, Pogo, Mr. Kidder said we have met the enemy, and he is our children.
 Jeffrey Seglin, a columnist who writes about ethics, acerbically wondered if Mr. Blagojevich considered himself more of a Kantian, Aristotelian or Utilitarian in his approach to ethical decisions. And, then, Mr. Seglin asked, ''This is the best they could do?''
 Mr. Seglin said he shared Northwestern's announcement with colleagues, one of whom responded, ''I suppose Eliot Spitzer speaking at Harvard's Safra Foundation Center for Ethics will be next. Oh wait, that happened last fall.''
 But there was a contrarian view from Larry Miller, a comic who occasionally writes about politics.
 ''There are so many shatteringly immoral thieves and cutthroats in government today, yesterday and tomorrow, so many in Chicago and Illinois and New York and Texas and Montana, so many galloping egomaniacs who just haven't been caught yet, so many roaches zipping around the kitchen floor before someone turns out the light, why not Blagojevich,'' said Mr. Miller, who recently appeared in Las Vegas with his chum Jerry Seinfeld.
 Mr. Miller, who as an actor has played some awful, ethically challenged souls on ''Law and Order,'' rather hyperbolically said: ''You and I don't want to live like this, but it's not too cynical to say, 'They are all like this.' In theory, O.K., there's one guy here, and one woman there, who are actually trustworthy. But isn't it axiomatic that as soon as one of these horrible egomaniacs first decides to run for something, anything, that it's irrefutable proof-positive the guy's a complete lunatic and thug?''
 His grand finale: ''Why not Blagojevich speaking on ethics? At least that has humor. Is it not far worse and creepy to have Hugo Chavez or Ahmadinejad welcome at the United Nations? These are seriously bad people, and we all stand and applaud and nod as if we were about to listen to U Thant,'' the former U.N. secretary general.
 Mr. Miller said he would rather take his moral lessons from the former governor.
 ''At least he's a homegrown, American thief,'' he said. ''Plus, he's smart enough to never stop dancing until they drag him away. Hell, good for him. As long as the truly horrible people of the world strut onto world stages like a decent person, let Rod be Rod.''
 The ''Death of Irony'' will presumably continue with the imminent arrival of the NBC series ''Celebrity Apprentice,'' on which Mr. Blagojevich is a desperately willing co-star.
 And sometime after that, the federal courthouse in Chicago will turn into a daily reality series, with our born-again ethicist in the dock, facing the prospect of trading his well-tailored threads for a prison jumpsuit.
 One hopes the Northwestern students read all about it.

HEADLINE: Clearing the Air at American Ports

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The Teamsters union and environmental activists have formed an unlikely and outspoken alliance aiming to clear the air in American ports, and perhaps bolster the Teamsters' ranks in the process.
 The labor-green alliance is getting under the trucking industry's skin by asserting that short-haul trucking companies working in ports -- and not the truck drivers, who are often considered independent contractors -- should spend the billions needed to buy new, low-emission rigs that can cost $100,000 to $175,000 each. 
 The Teamsters union says seaport air is so dirty largely because port truck drivers earn too little to buy trucks that would belch out fewer diesel particulates, tiny particles that contribute to cancer and asthma. Working with environmentalists, the union helped persuade the Port of Los Angeles to adopt a far-reaching plan that bars old trucks from hauling cargo from the port and puts the burden of buying new vehicles on the trucking companies, not the drivers.
 The battle has intensified as federal officials press ports to adhere to clean-air regulations. Seaports from Newark to Miami to Seattle are confronting the same issue: who should pay for the cleaner trucks? 
 ''We think if you have the big trucking companies own the equipment and maintain it, the trucks will be cleaner,'' said David Pettit, director of the Natural Resource Defense Council's Southern California Clean Air Program. Noting that both trucks and ships contribute to port pollution, he said, ''we got involved because the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the single biggest contributors to air pollution in the L.A. area, and that's because of diesel pollution.'' 
 Environmental groups are happy to have the Teamsters' political muscle behind efforts to clean up the ports, while the union likes having environmentalists backing its goal: requiring port trucking companies to employ their drivers directly, rather than as independent contractors because employees, unlike contractors, can join unions. The Teamsters are eager to unionize the nation's more than 40,000 port drivers. 
 The labor-green alliance achieved a major victory in late 2008 when it helped persuade the mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, a former union organizer, and the city's port to require trucking companies to employ their drivers directly, making the companies bear the cost of buying new rigs. 
 Angry that this move increased their labor costs, trucking companies sued to block the policy. A federal judge on Thursday announced she would hold a civil trial beginning April 20. 
 Last April, the Federal District Court judge in the case, Christina A. Snyder, granted an injunction suspending the mandate while letting stand the ban on pre-1994 trucks. The judge said the suspended rules were pre-empted by a federal law that regulated trucking.
 The American Trucking Associations, the industry group, wants to maintain the current structure in which most port drivers are considered independent contractors responsible for buying their own trucks. The group also wants the seaports to subsidize purchases of new trucks, whether by drivers or the companies. 
 The industry does not hide its dismay about the labor-environmental coalitions that have sprouted in various cities.
 ''A lot of these groups are just front groups for the Teamsters, and it's really horrible that they're attacking these drivers and saying they can't possibly finance newer trucks and don't know how to maintain them,'' said Clayton Boyce, a spokesman for the American Trucking Associations. ''That is a total falsehood.''
 But Rafael Prestol, a truck driver at the Port of Newark, disagreed, saying he could not possibly afford a new truck. When he became a driver in 1978, his salary was $425 a week, but some weeks, he says, he still nets the same amount -- just $425 -- after fuel and other expenses.
 ''If we invest $100,000 in a new vehicle and we're making $2,000 a month or less, it doesn't make sense,'' said Mr. Prestol, who blames trucking deregulation for pulling down drivers' pay. ''And what guarantee do you have after you buy a new truck that you'll continue to get work?''
 In addition to Mayor Villaraigosa, the Teamsters and environmentalists have lined up other backers, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, Mayor Corey Booker of Newark and other mayors, senators and representatives.
 With a recent Rutgers study finding that port drivers earned $29,000 a year on average (after paying for their trucks, maintenance, fuel and insurance), Mr. Bloomberg said, ''Truck drivers simply can't afford to buy expensive trucks. They're barely earning enough to make ends meet in a job that should be providing them with a solid, middle-class living.''
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the Port of Newark, has introduced an antipollution plan that includes $28 million in grants and subsidized loans, totaling nearly $50,000 a truck, that aim to enable 630 drivers to buy new rigs to replace the dirtiest ones. The industry likes the plan. But drivers like Mr. Prestol say the subsidies are inadequate, considering the cost of the rigs. 
 The Port of Los Angeles hired the Boston Consulting Group to help develop its ambitious plan. 
 That plan charges companies like Wal-Mart $70 for each shipping container hauled by older trucks as a way to finance $42 million in subsidies to buy cleaner trucks. With grants of $20,000 a truck, that program has helped companies buy 2,100 new trucks, including 250 trucks powered by liquid natural gas. Both the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's largest port complex, have banned pre-1994 trucks. 
 Port officials in Los Angeles channeled the grants to trucking companies, convinced that most drivers did not have the wherewithal to buy new trucks or maintain them adequately. 
 ''I used to see a lot of people drive messed up trucks, badly maintained trucks,'' said Carlos Santamaria, a driver in Los Angeles. ''They often had to make a decision, 'do I fix my truck or do I put food on the table?' '' 
 Los Angeles officials wanted to make the port less of a free-for-all where trucking companies and drivers constantly undercut each other on price, leaving too little money for them, in the port's view, to buy new trucks and maintain them. 
 John Holmes, deputy executive director of operations at the Port of Los Angeles, said some might describe the port as perfect, free-market economics, but he described it as ''cavemen economics.''
 To transform the system, the port required that trucking companies treat their drivers as employees, arguing that this would ensure better, cleaner trucks because the companies, not the drivers, would be responsible for buying and maintaining the rigs.
 As a result of the grants, the ban on pre-1994 trucks and the extra fees for using trucks from 1994 to 2003, the industry had bought more than 6,000 new trucks since the Los Angeles plan took effect in October 2008.
 ''We say emissions are down 70 percent since the program began,'' Mr. Holmes said. ''This program has probably been the most successful environmental program on the planet in terms of reducing emissions.''
 Dismayed by the judge's ruling partly blocking the plan, Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Villaraigosa and Mr. Booker are pressing Congress to amend truck-deregulation law so that local ports would have greater power to adopt environmental and safety rules, including ones like the suspended employee mandate in Los Angeles.
 The trucking industry opposes such legislation. ''We need to keep trucking regulated by the federal government to prevent a patchwork of regulations across the country,'' Mr. Boyce said. 
 Michael Fox, president of a trucking firm in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., opposes any mandate that companies treat drivers as employees.
 ''It's just a bad idea to dictate that you can only do business one way,'' said Mr. Fox.
 With the injunction in force, some companies that hired drivers as $18-an-hour employees now employ them as independent contractors. 
 Once again, many drivers are rushing to haul as many loads as they can each week, although they often wait for two unpaid hours to pick up loads. Many say they now earn $8 to $10 an hour. Mr. Holmes and many environmentalists ask who will buy the next generation of trucks in five years if it is left to the drivers. 
 ''You can't get clean air on the backs of the drivers,'' said Amy Goldsmith, executive director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation. ''They can't possibly earn enough the way the system is set up, with the drivers required to buy gas, insurance and equipment.''

HEADLINE: 2 Bite-Size Eateries Too Popular for Their Neighbors' Good

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
It is the sandwich that ate the neighborhood.
 Ike's Place, a tiny doorway eatery in San Francisco's Castro village, has become such a foodie sensation that it has reached the pinnacle of Bay Area success: protest.
With up to 1,200 customers on sunny weekend days, Ike's has faced a backlash from neighbors. The once-quiet block on 16th Street is fed up with patrons who wait up to two hours for their chance to taste what they believe is nirvana between two slices of bread. In response to complaints, Ike's reduced its hours starting this month -- it closes at 7 p.m. 
 ''The only time we're not busy is when we're not open,'' said Ike Shehadeh, the owner.
 On one level, what has happened to Ike's is emblematic of local attitudes -- it has often been said that San Francisco has never met a protest it didn't like. But Nimby over a sandwich could be a new low.
 A deeper look reveals an evolving trend in the local restaurant scene in which select homegrown favorites have made the leap from mere phenomena into the realm of obsession, leading to swarms of foodies who sometimes disregard common manners to sate their cravings. Fueled by the Internet, the trend is also a citizen uprising that undermines the power of food-critic gatekeepers.
 What pushed Ike's into this stratosphere is a combination of mouthful and myth. Those in line say, ''It's the best sandwich I've ever eaten.'' The bread is baked to order, smothered in garlicky ''dirty sauce,'' and the 183 different sandwiches -- some secret and available only to insiders -- have whimsical names like the Backstabber (chicken with Caesar dressing) and the Do You Smell What Barack Is Cooking (thinly sliced rib-eye), both $7.97.
 When Mr. Shehadeh, 31, opened in 2007, no one was buying his culinary view -- he had zero customers his first day. Depressed from what appeared to be a devastating failure, he closed for a week.
 After he reopened, customers trickled in, and soon Mr. Shehadeh heard a powerful four-letter-word: Yelp. Diners posted raves on Yelp, an online review site. Business doubled every few months, Ike's now employs 47, and on busy days a reservation is required -- yes, for a sandwich.
 On Yelp there are nearly 2,000 reviews with an average score of 4.5 stars out of a possible five, putting Ike's in the ranks of Gary Danko, a Michelin star winner -- a remarkable feat that happened without the blessing of the vaunted local newspaper food critic. 
 That makes Ike's the people's choice, and this sense of ownership mixed with fervor has brought repercussions. On one recent Saturday afternoon, the crowd was so big that the sidewalk was impassable. Without tables or seating, customers commandeer neighbors' stoops and doorways. Masking tape on the sidewalk marks a feeble effort to prevent diners from blocking homes' entrances.
 Ike's installed stanchions to manage the line, but, in the end, foodie entitlement could be managed in only one way: closing early so neighbors could get some peace and quiet.
 There is a similar scene at Bi-Rite Creamery, an ice cream parlor near Dolores Park. With more than 2,200 Yelp reviews -- many of them wild for the salted caramel flavor -- the line stretches around the block, resulting in as many as 1,500 scoops a day. 
 ''I'm amazed every single day,'' Kris Hoogerhyde, a co-owner, said of the popularity.
 The creamery's crowd is well-behaved, but at night many patrons are loud as they wander over to the spirited dining in the Mission and forget that the area is residential. ''We go out there every once in a while and ask people to be respectful of the neighbors,'' Ms. Hoogerhyde.
 Bi-Rite is temporarily closed for an expansion that will allow some of the crowd to move inside, and when it reopens, there will be eight new stanchions to try to keep customers in line.
 Alison Bing, a food writer and the author of Lonely Planet's ''San Francisco Encounter,'' said Ike's and Bi-Rite Creamery ''inspire a level of passion that is unprecedented.'' She credits Internet chatter, but also said that both places sold upscale comfort food, morsels of luxury at recession prices -- for those willing to invest the time waiting in line.
 ''I would do it,'' Ms. Bing said.
 Mr. Shehadeh is clearly touched by all the attention -- the word ''love'' pops up repeatedly in his conversation. And he is in the midst of spreading that love around: He has opened an Ike's in Redwood Shores, and will soon have a third at Stanford University.
 Alert the swarm.

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Hummer

 BODY:
The world might be saved: It looks as if the Hummer is destined for the junkyard. The plan by General Motors to sell the muscular brand to a Chinese company went up in a puff of exhaust smoke on Wednesday after government officials in China said that they had never received the necessary application for approval and thus couldn't grant it. 
 We suspect the deal collapsed because the Chinese Communist Party -- which rarely shows much shame -- is worried about China's image as the most polluting nation on the planet. If true, that is good news.
 There may be other good news. While some policy analysts have called -- sensibly, in our opinion -- for steeper gasoline taxes to encourage American drivers to embrace fuel efficiency, some economists have been skeptical. They acknowledge that drivers might decide to drive less and take public transportation more. But they warn that most could not afford to quickly dump their gas guzzlers for more fuel-efficient cars. 
 Yet given time, it seems, people change their ways. Americans drove 3.4 percent fewer miles in 2008 -- when gas prices shot up to a peak of $4 a gallon nationally -- than in 2007. And many who had bought the Hummer when a gallon of gas cost $2 decided that they couldn't afford to tool around town in a small tank that would run, on average, around 10 miles on a gallon. 
 By last year, even as gas prices drifted downward, only about 9,000 Hummers were sold in the United States. That was a steep drop from 71,000 in 2006. In the spring of 2008, G.M. announced that it could not keep the sinking brand. The company is weighing two long-shot bids, but it is more than likely to wind down the brand. 
 Gasoline is back around $2.50 a gallon, and Americans are falling back on some of their old bad habits. Still, the Hummer's tale is a vivid example of the power of gas prices to change Americans' ways. It also suggests that, given the proper incentives and disincentives, all the world's nations can embrace a greener future.

HEADLINE: Union Election Further Complicates a Tangled City Budget

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
When the ballot counters at Local 1021 of the Service Employees International Union announce the results of the union's bitter leadership election Saturday, the news will be felt keenly in two quarters. 
 One is the fractious world of labor: the former leaders pushed aside during a reorganization of regional unions three years ago are seeking to return to power by promising to hold back the recent tide of pay cuts and layoffs. The leadership installed three years ago is making similar promises to retain power.
The second is in San Francisco City Hall, which spends 52 percent of its $6.6 billion budget on personnel costs. Unless it can manage to trim what it pays those nurses, social workers and janitors, the city will not be able to make ends meet next year.
 What this means in the near term is that the city's goal of winning labor's backing for the short- and long-term solutions to budget deficits is likely to be difficult to achieve. 
 The looming deficit for the fiscal year that begins July 1, and the difficult decisions it brings, comes on the heels of cuts made by the city to close last year's $438 million gap. Last June, services like substance-abuse programs were sharply reduced and more than 500 public employees were laid off. 
 In the longer term, the results could loosen the knots that have bound unions with the dominant Democratic Party and its mayors and supervisors, which would be a striking change for a city where labor leaders like Harry Bridges once held sway. 
 Despite all the young professionals and affluent retirees who have arrived in the decades since, and notwithstanding all the other issues the left has rallied around along the way, like gay rights, steadfast support for labor has been the beating heart of this city's progressive politics. 
 It is a banner carried today by members of the Board of Supervisors like David Campos and Eric Mar. ''I used to be a shop steward for the S.E.I.U. and organized in the workplace,'' Mr. Mar said. ''This is a strongly labor town and as one of the elected officials, I'm doing my best to make sure they are represented.''
 But, he added, ''we're in the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, and people's fears of the economy and their pocketbooks will drive their decision making.'' 
 Steve Ponder, a compensation analyst in the city's Department of Human Resources said that while San Francisco's unionized city workers were paid about the same as other public employees in the Bay Area, they did considerably better than private-sector peers. 
 A janitor working for the city can make as much as $50,000 in base salary, not including $27,800 in benefits. Mr. Ponder said a janitor in the private sector typically earned less than half that amount in total compensation.
 Against that backdrop, the city is facing both short- and long-term bills accumulated during decades of mutual support between labor unions and City Hall. 
 The unified city and county government now spends about 13 percent of the budget, or $890 million, on pensions and benefits. By 2014, these alone will rise 57 percent, to $1.4 billion. Most of the expenditures will come from general fund dollars -- now a pie of around $3 billion, or less than half the city's total budget. That portion of the budget represents most of what can be easily shifted around as the supervisors and the mayor wrangle over for economic and social priorities.
 The trend lines laid out by city economists describe a government with a shrinking capacity to deliver vital services or underwrite new initiatives, particularly if pension obligations keep expanding. And then there is the immediate problem of the near-record $522 million deficit for the coming fiscal year. 
 ''This is the toughest year that anyone has seen in recent history,'' said David Chiu, the president of the Board of Supervisors, ''in large part because last year we cut to the bone, and this year, we're cutting bone.''
 Yet city management and labor leaders alike say that at this critical time, with so many jobs at stake, bargaining efforts have by been hindered by a labor movement dogged by infighting.
 ''Hopefully with the outcome of the elections in the next month we'll see some unity that will allow them to speak with one voice,'' said Mike Casey, the president of the city's labor council. ''Right now, that kind of unity doesn't exist. It's not even close.''
 The mayor's office says the city is seeking $70 million from wage givebacks alone, excluding additional savings from layoffs or reconfigurations of the workweek. Mayor Gavin Newsom's spokesman, Tony Winnicker, said the city could lay off 10,000 of the 26,000 city workers --who now work a 40-hour week -- and then rehire most of them to work for 37.5 hours. This would be an effective 6.5 percent pay cut and would save $50 million.
 Damita Davis-Howard, the interim director of Local 1021 of the S.E.I.U., has told reporters that Mr. Newsom's plan was ''not the right track; it's the next step in a downward spiral for the city and its citizens.'' Through a spokesman, she declined to be interviewed for this article.
 The fight over pensions is just as barbed. Ben Rosenfield, city budget director, said in an interview, ''Every dollar we are spending on benefits is a dollar not available to solve deficits or fund city services. The challenge at the moment is that our cost increases are expected to consume the vast majority, if not all, of our expected revenue growth. What that means is while we are dealing larger macroeconomic issues like declining revenues from the state, we really don't have the benefit of local tax revenues to help us.''
 Most city unions already contribute 7.5 percent of their wages toward pensions, except for the S.E.I.U., which argues that its members are paid less than any other union workers on the payroll. The city has picked up S.E.I.U. members' contributions for the past decade as part of an arrangement made years ago when the union gave up a 7.5 percent raise. 
 In December, Supervisor Sean Elsbernd introduced a well-received measure that would require all city employees to contribute 7.5 percent of their annual pension payments. The labor council made a counterproposal with relatively minor changes. 
 Mr. Elsbernd's bill originally calculated the pension payouts based on an average of worker's salary over the final three years. The council wanted to average the last two years.
 But this month, Supervisors Mar and Campos, who represent two labor-heavy districts, introduced a further amendment to Mr. Elsbernd's bill that would negate the pension contributions with a pay raise for the S.E.I.U., a move that would in fact increase costs to the city, according to the city controller. 
 The internal battles within the service employees union have also created confusion in the negotiations.
 ''When I meet with the other unions,'' Mr. Elsbernd said, ''they all send their president or attorney or two or three people. I have to sit down with 65 to 85 people from the S.E.I.U. bargaining team every time because they're simply unable to delegate the responsibility of conferring.''
 This chaotic approach is the result of lingering distrust between the factions vying for control of the union, city official and representatives of other unions said. 
 One source of bitterness revolved around accusations of skullduggery over the union's response last year to the city's effort to have S.E.I.U. members give up a 3.75 percent raise that had been promised for years.
 Brenda Barros, a union activist who supports the existing leadership under Ms. Davis-Howard, accused allies of Sin Yee Poon, the head of the rival faction, of altering the agreement while key negotiators were on vacation. The revisions were later disavowed at a rowdy membership meeting. Union members said it was not clear whether Ms. Davis-Howard or Ms. Poon would prevail in the contest for control of the union. But Ms. Poon said the election had one clear result already: ''It's moved us closer to directing our resources and focusing our energies to get what we need to stand up against the attacks on pensions and other unfair demands.''
 The negotiations between the unions and the city are expected to continue until June, the deadline for passing next year's budget.

HEADLINE: Looking To Taxes As Solution To a Crisis

BYLINE: By JAMES O'SHEA

 BODY:
With a fiscal crisis looming in Illinois, some influential people concerned about the dismal condition of the state's finances are proposing that lawmakers increase the individual income tax rate by two-thirds and the corporate rate by one-third. 
 Taxes are a hot political issue. Illinois has the lowest income tax rate of the 41 states that tax wage income, so the low rate on income makes the tax a juicy target during a tough budget fight. But since governments also impose taxes on sales, property and other transactions, getting a handle on where Illinois stands is not simple.
This week, the Civic Federation, an influential group based in Chicago, issued its prescription for Illinois's financial troubles. 
 Coupled with spending cuts, reform of an underfunded public pension system and other tax increases, the Civic Federation advocates a higher income tax to help put Illinois on sound fiscal footing as it copes with a $13 billion budget deficit and recession that has driven the unemployment rate above 10 percent.
 Illinois could raise about $6 billion, covering roughly half the expected 2011 budget deficit, by increasing the Illinois income tax rate on individuals to 5 percent, from the current 3 percent, and raising the corporate tax rate to 6.4 percent, from 4.8 percent, the Civic Federation's said. 
 But higher taxes also affect how employers view the state's business climate, a calculation that factors in state and local taxes on retail sales and business income, too. The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that measures federal and state taxes, said Illinois's business climate suffers because low income tax rates are offset by the high rates on retail sales and property transactions. 
 As of September 2009, Illinois's combined state and local sales taxes averaged 8.4 percent, making the state the sixth-biggest taxer, just ahead of New York, said Justin Higgenbottom, a Tax Foundation analyst. Illinois's high taxes on property earn it sixth place in that category. 
 In addition to the corporate rate of 4.8 percent, other taxes bring the effective Illinois corporate rate to 7.3 percent, Mr. Higgenbottom said. That means the Civic Federation proposal would in effect take the state's top corporate rate in Illinois to 8.9 percent. 
 Once the analysts add it all up, the Tax Foundation said Illinois's state and local taxes in the 2008 fiscal year represented 9.3 percent of the state's income. That ranks Illinois below the national average of 9.7 percent and roughly the same as surrounding states except Wisconsin, which is higher. 
 Raising income taxes would give the state a one-shot source of revenue, he said, but it would make the state's revenue base more volatile while damaging the business climate in a state that already ranks 30th on the Foundation's index. 
 Since a state income tax of 2.5 percent was first enacted in 1969, lawmakers have several times moved the rate between 2.5 percent and 3 percent. In 1993, though, the legislature made the 3 percent rate permanent -- at least until it decides to change it again.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THOMAS CHAMBERS (1808-1869): AMERICAN MARINE AND LANDSCAPE PAINTER,' through March 7. With this extraordinary show, a star is born, or rediscovered, or at least given a big museum survey for the first time since 1942. Chambers painted typical 19th-century fare -- Hudson River landscapes and marine views of ships, harbors and naval battles -- in an entrancing, slightly demonic style that was neither strictly realist nor naive. His paintings are like chorus lines singing and dancing their hearts out, ever so slightly off key and out of step. They amplify the understanding of the visual appetite by satisfying it so thoroughly. Chambers may have been the first American artist to have grasped -- as Cezanne and Seurat would -- the implicitly geometric nature of reality. It makes sense that even in 1942 he was called ''America's first modern.'' 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20100225 
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100225
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN USA: CONTEMPORARY INNOVATION,' through April 4. Less an exhibition than an extra-large design seminar in your head, this dense display presents work by all 78 recipients of the annual National Design Awards, which were established in 2000. Encompassing several generations, it honors individuals and corporations and recognizes historic achievements and some of the latest things. One of these is a specially programmed iPod Touch that serves as an exhibition guide; it puts the show in the palm of your hand and is free. Don't even think about not using it. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)20100225
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'TINO SEHGAL,' through March 10. If you've ever wanted to see the interior of the Guggenheim in its pristine state, now's the time. For the solo exhibition of the young European artist Tino Sehgal, the great spiraling rotunda, recently ablaze with Kandinskys, has been cleared out. Yet the space isn't empty. On the rotunda's ground floor, a man and a woman perform an ever-changing, slow-motion amorous embrace. On the ramps above, people walk and talk in pairs or clusters at a leisurely pace, with new participants periodically joining conversations as others drop away. You're invited to join the conversation, be part of the art, in this deeply refreshing, there-but-not-there show. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Holland Cotter)20100225
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ANISH KAPOOR,' through March 28. This exhibition by the celebrated British sculptor consists of just one work, but it's a doozy. Viewable only from three partial perspectives, ''Memory'' is an enormous, egg-shaped volume of Cor-Ten steel, wedged into a boxy side gallery like a dirigible that drifted off course and got stuck. One approach offers only a square window allowing you to behold the impenetrable, seemingly infinite darkness inside. Call it a womb with a view. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)20100225
 JEWISH MUSEUM: 'ALIAS MAN RAY: THE ART OF REINVENTION,' through March 14. This show, a traditional retrospective with an irresistible biographical hook, gives roots to an artist who preferred to be seen as rootless. Born Emmanuel Radnitzky to Jewish emigres from Russia, Man Ray reinvented himself as one of the luminaries of the interwar avant-garde. Yet his garment-industry background had a material hold on him, visible in references to mannequins, coat hangers and patterns. More than 200 works, including paintings, photographs, films, assemblages and his signature rayographs, link Man Ray's frequent shifts among mediums to a more profound condition of restlessness. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100225
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERING THE ART OF CHINESE PAINTING: XIE ZHILIU (1910-1997),' through July 25. This philosophically intriguing exhibition presents drawings and paintings by a 20th-century Chinese artist and professor who was trained in traditional artistic methods in his youth. That meant primarily copying and tracing drawings and paintings by past masters. Xie's elegant but unimaginative copies are interesting mainly for what they reveal about how classical artists arrived at works of seemingly effortless perfection: not by observing nature but by repeatedly imitating other artists. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100225
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERPIECES OF FRENCH ART DECO,' ongoing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20100225
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PLAYING WITH PICTURES: THE ART OF VICTORIAN PHOTOCOLLAGE,' through May 9. This seemingly modest, startlingly reverberant exhibition reveals that upper-class Englishwomen of the 1860s and '70s devised an early form of collage, the supposedly Cubist breakthrough. Adding cutout photographs of family, friends, royals and celebrities to the watercolor albums that were already an acceptable female activity, they created all kind of witty effects -- drawing-room scenes, trompe l'oeil designs, human-animal hybrids. The effects of Darwinism and the publication of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' register in these amazing works, as does the collective, even osmotic nature of invention. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20100225
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE DRAWINGS OF BRONZINO,' through April 18. Agnolo Bronzino was the hand to hire for a power portrait in mid-16th-century Florence. He could turn toddlers into potentates and make money-mad Medicis look like decent people. At his peak, in the 1550s, he was the most influential artist in Florence. So why, given his fame, he has had to wait some 500 years for a museum solo is a puzzle. But that solo has now arrived at the Met. Encompassing all but 2 of the 61 works on paper currently attributed to the artist, and justifying each attribution in its gorgeous catalog, the show is scholarly tour de force and a breathtaking demonstration of a sovereign hand at work and at play. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20100225
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100225
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' ongoing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100225
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DEMONS AND DEVOTION: THE HOURS OF CATHERINE OF CLEVES,' through May 2. The need for new bindings creates the rare, maybe one-time chance to see 93 of the 157 surviving miniatures from the extraordinary illuminated book of hours commissioned around 1440 by Catherine of Cleves (1417-1479) in the southern Netherlands. Among the masterpieces of a golden age by an anonymous artist known only as the Master of Catherine of Cleves, it features exquisite, jewel-like miniatures that locate the Holy Family, apostles, and saints in the here and now, among detailed interiors and landscapes and trompe l'oeil borders. The kingdom of God gives way to that of the real. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Roberta Smith)20100225
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROME AFTER RAPHAEL,' through May 9. This exhibition of 16th-century Italian drawings from the Morgan's collection covers a lot of ground. It moves, in fits and starts, from the High Renaissance to Mannerism and the nascent Baroque. And it's enlivened by the classic match-up of Raphael versus Michelangelo; drawings by both artists, and their followers, pit Raphael's sprezzatura, or relaxed refinement, against Michelangelo's vein-popping muscularity. Look for drawings by Parmigianino (in Raphael's camp) and the sumptuous Farnese Hours by Giulio Clovio (in Michelangelo's), in addition to splendid Late Mannerist studies by Anibale Carracci. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100225
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'BIGGER, BETTER, MORE: THE ART OF VIOLA FREY,' through May 2. Viola Frey's giant ceramic sculptures of men and women are among the underappreciated wonders of late-20th-century art. Rising 11 feet and higher, wearing business suits and ties and nondescript dresses, they have a spookily imposing physical presence and a clunky, cartoonish ugliness. With their blank or seemingly angry expressions, they may remind you of what it was like to be a child among grown-ups troubled by incomprehensible problems. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100225
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 7: MIRAGE BY JOAN JONAS,' through May 31. It helps to think of time as cyclical, or at least non-Western and nonlinear, when encountering Joan Jonas's ''Mirage'' at the Museum of Modern Art. The latest installation of a piece conceived in 1976, it suggests that Ms. Jonas's art has a longer-than-usual life span because it's constantly being reborn. In its current form at MoMA, ''Mirage'' consists of six moving-image works arranged in a loose circle and accompanied by a series of props: metal cones, chalkboards, a mask and a wooden hoop, among other objects. Performance, drawing, dance and video combine and recombine in arcane but thrilling ways. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100225
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TIM BURTON,' through April 26. Given the tremendous visual appeal of Mr. Burton's movies, you would expect that this expansive retrospective of his nonmoving art would be equally exciting. Alas, it is a let-down. Focused mainly on hundreds of Victorian-Gothic-Expressionist cartoons dating from his teenage years to the present and including paintings, sculptures, photographs and a smattering of short films on flat screens, it is an entertaining show, but there is a sameness to all Mr. Burton's two- and three-dimensional output that makes for a monotonous viewing experience. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Ken Johnson)20100225
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20100225
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Ken Johnson)20100225
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: DANIEL BOZHKOV AND DUKE RILEY, through March 13. Two young and opportunistic artists -- Daniel Bozhkov and Duke Riley -- have found a way to make the most of the Queens Museum's transitional state. (The museum is in the process of expanding.) Egged on by trusting curators and a residency program, Launch Pad, that encourages exploration of the site and the Queens community, they have turned to the surrounding park and its former ice rink for materials and inspiration. Their adjacent solo installations are well worth seeing, if only because they are profoundly at odds with each other: Mr. Bozhkov salvages, while Mr. Riley torches the place in a ''naumachia'' (Roman naval battle). Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100225
 RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VISIONS OF THE COSMOS: FROM THE MILKY OCEAN TO AN EVOLVING UNIVERSE,' through May 10. This exhibition sets up a thought-provoking compare-contrast exercise between Western and Eastern ways of picturing the universe. On one side, myths about the cosmos are vividly imagined in Hindu, Buddhist and Jainist paintings and sculptures. On the other side, the West's progressively more empirically based beliefs are represented mainly by illustrations in antique books, with astronomical photographs made by high-tech machines like the Hubble Space Telescope representing current scientific knowledge. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea , (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Johnson)20100225
 SCULPTURE CENTER : 'LEOPARDS IN THE TEMPLE,' through March 30. Inspired by a Kafka short story, this exhibition says a lot about the state of contemporary art. It presents an international array of artists who riff on familiar conventions of modern art. Kitty Kraus's squared-off lengths of men's suit fabric lying flat on the floor evoke Carl Andre but with a feminist twist. Don't miss the funny, magical films by the team of Joao Maria Gusmao and Pedro Paiva in the basement. 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson)20100225
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20100225
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: '30 SECONDS OFF AN INCH,' through March 14. This exhibition of 60 disparate artworks by 42 contemporary artists from several generations might be called revisionist. It takes a refreshingly visual, even formal, approach to art that is usually plumbed for political and social meanings based largely on the artist's identity. Its curator, Naomi Beckwith, wants to emphasize the meanings -- social and otherwise -- embedded in the actual objects on view. Her success is mixed, partly because she doesn't spend much time explaining the experiential nature of her selections in the catalog, and also because she includes too many familiar, established artists. But she makes many excellent choices, introduces some promising young talent and displays a visual intelligence that is often rare in her chosen profession. 144 West 125th Street , (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)20100225
 Galleries: Uptown
 'PAINTINGS OF FELIX VALLOTTON,' through April 10. The Swiss artist Felix Vallotton (1865-1925) was and still is much admired for his elegantly simplified, erotic woodcut prints. This show of paintings from 1905 to 1912, all depicting attractive young women in different states of dress and dishabille, is a revelation. Inspired by Ingres, these works offer a weird, frankly lubricious classicism. It would be great to see more. Michael Werner, 4 East 77 Street , (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Johnson)20100225
 Galleries: Chelsea
 CHRISTIAN HOLSTAD: 'THE WORLD'S GONE BEAUTIFUL,' through March 6. Christian Holstad was part of a wave of young, busy-handed, crafts-oriented artists who gained attention in the mid-2000s, when the art market was trying to leave identity politics and consumerist critique behind. As it turned out, his work was about both, but he was talking about them in a new way, from the vantage point of a child antsy with adult appetites; many of them are evident in this recession-conscious show of soft-sculpture shopping carts and sex-food-and-religion collages. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street , (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com. (Holland Cotter)20100225
 Galleries: Other
 JIMMY RASKIN: 'INSEPARABILITY VS. SIMULTANEITY,' through March 14. Mr. Raskin explains his multimedia works in impenetrable prose illustrated by textbooklike diagrams referring to Nietszche, Pinocchio and black holes. Fortunately, he also makes lively, visually interesting sculptures that revolve mainly around oppositions between geometric abstraction and messy collage and assemblage. Modernist purity meets Postmodernist festivity to thought-provoking effect. Miguel Abreu, 35 Orchard Street, Lower East Side , (212) 995-1774, miguelabreugallery.com. (Johnson)20100225
 Last Chance
 'MASTERS DRAWINGS'; closes on Friday. This exhibition concentrates on works produced in Italy, France and the Netherlands during the 17th and 18th centuries, but its outer boundaries reach farther. From around 1500 there are rare images from Fra Bartolommeo and the circle of Rogier van der Weyden (Mary swooning into the arms of two attendants, an image that seems more carved than drawn). A William Blake pen-and-ink-with-watercolor depicts St. Augustine converting King Ethelbert with a characteristic fusion of comedy and gravity. The 19th- and 20th-century artists represented include Whistler, Klimt, Picasso, Maurice Prendergast and Reginald Marsh. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street , (212) 570-0090, tunickart.com. (Smith)20100225
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'NEXUS NEW YORK: LATIN/AMERICAN ARTISTS IN THE MODERN METROPOLIS'; closes on Sunday. A bright light at the top of Museum Mile, the city's premier Latino art center has reopened after a makeover with a dense, episodic and absorbing visual history of the Latino art presence in New York in the first half of the 20th century. As much an archival display as a standard art show, it focuses on luminous, culture-changing personalities, from the Mexican-born art impresario Marius de Zayas, who teamed up with Alfred Stieglitz to bring the first Picasso show to New York; to Joaquin Torres-Garcia, a Uruguayan who arrived in New York in 1920 and saw proto-Pop Art everywhere; to the Chilean Roberto Matta, a dynamic agent for Old World Surrealism in the New World. In addition, El Museo now has its first permanent-collection gallery, with an installation, ''Voces y Visiones,'' that reaffirms historical connections to the nearby East Harlem neighborhood. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem , (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)20100225
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'GABRIEL OROZCO'; closes on Monday. Gabriel Orozco's delightful 1993 solo debut at the Museum of Modern Art was a barely-there affair of a few photographs, a ball of clay, a hammock and some fresh fruit. His one-man gallery show the next year was sparser still, with four plastic Dannon yogurt cups nailed to the walls of the gallery's otherwise empty space. Mr. Orozco has since gotten considerable mileage out of this early thinking-light phase. Tapped by museums in Chicago, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Mexico City, where he was raised, he has become an object of admiring critical scrutiny, and a hero to many young artists. Why? The question lingers, only half-answered, after seeing this retrospective, a taut, attractive but oddly conventional-looking survey, heavy on painting and sculpture. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20100225
 THE ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'THE ORIGINS OF EL GRECO: ICON PAINTING IN VENETIAN CRETE'; closes on Saturday. With its ensemble of some 40 religious images, including 6 by Domenikos Theotokopoulos, better known as El Greco, this glowing show is essentially a triple-layered visual essay. It roughs out the complex texture of a specific, cosmopolitan, East-meets-West island culture. It tells the story of a great artist who emerged from that culture, lived outside it and lastingly belonged to it. And it begins to suggest the variety and charisma of icons as a genre: spiritually instrumental objects that lie outside and beyond ordinary definitions of art. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street , (212) 486-4448, onassisusa.org. (Cotter)20100225
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL'; closes on Monday. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20100225
 CHARLES STEFFEN: 'DRAWING NUDES IS LIKE SAYING A PRAYER, AMEN'; closes on Saturday. Rendered in serpentine lines, the naked women drawn late in life by this Chicago outsider artist have bug eyes and a stocky corpulence, like sexed-up troll dolls. Grotesque and cute, they call to mind the cartoons of Gahan Wilson and Basil Wolverton. Steffen (1927-1995) drew his other favorite subject, sunflowers, with a lovely, naturalistic touch. His women with sunflower heads are like deities for a nature religion. Edlin Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea , (212) 206-9723, edlingallery.com. (Johnson)20100225

HEADLINE: Plan To Seek Use Of U.S. Contracts As a Wage Lever

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The Obama administration is planning to use the government's enormous buying power to prod private companies to improve wages and benefits for millions of workers, according to White House officials and several interest groups briefed on the plan.
 By altering how it awards $500 billion in contracts each year, the government would disqualify more companies with labor, environmental or other violations and give an edge to companies that offer better levels of pay, health coverage, pensions and other benefits, the officials said. 
 Because nearly one in four workers is employed by companies that have contracts with the federal government, administration officials see the plan as a way to shape social policy and lift more families into the middle class. It would affect contracts like those awarded to make Army uniforms, clean federal buildings and mow lawns at military bases.
 Although the details are still being worked out, the outline of the plan is drawing fierce opposition from business groups and Republican lawmakers. They see it as a gift to organized labor and say it would drive up costs for the government in the face of a $1.3 trillion budget deficit. 
 ''I'm suspicious of what the end goals are,'' said Ben Brubeck, director of labor and federal procurement for Associated Builders and Contractors, which represents 25,000 construction-related companies. ''It's pretty clear the agenda is to give big labor an advantage in federal contracts.''
 Critics also said the policy would put small businesses, many of which do not provide rich benefits, at a disadvantage. Furthermore, government officials would find it difficult to evaluate bidders using the new criteria and to determine whether one company's compensation package should give it an edge, said Alan L. Chvotkin, executive vice president of the Professional Services Council, a coalition of 340 government contractors.
 From his earliest days in office, President Obama has called for an overhaul of government procurement policy, citing the contracting scandals of the previous decade involving cost overruns and no-bid contracts. 
 ''The president made it clear that he is committed to reforming government contracts to save taxpayers money while protecting workers and the environment,'' a White House spokesman, Bill Burton, said. ''The administration is currently gathering data and examining the best ways to do this.''
 Two of Mr. Obama's allies -- John Podesta, the Clinton administration chief of staff who headed the president's transition team, and Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union -- have repeatedly pressed the president to use procurement policy to push up wages and benefits.
 In testimony last year to the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Podesta said that 400,000 workers employed under federal contracts -- like cafeteria workers, security guards and landscaping workers at federal buildings -- earn less than $22,000 a year, the federal poverty line for a family of four, assuming just one paycheck in a household. 
 ''We have a president who is talking about bringing more people into the middle class,'' Mr. Stern said. ''The government should expect contractors to obey the law, and at the same time contractors should not be building a poverty economy, but should be trying to build a high-road economy.'' 
 The officials briefed on the plan said it was being developed by officials in the Office of Management and Budget, the White House Office of Legal Counsel, the Treasury, Justice and Labor Departments and the vice president's Middle Class Task Force.
 Even as business groups press the administration for more details, they are denouncing the plan, tentatively named the High Road Procurement Policy. 
 The Daily Caller, a conservative Web site, reported Feb. 4 that the plan would ''heavily favor government contractors that implement policies designed by organized labor.''
 Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor at the United States Chamber of Commerce, called the plan a ''warmed-over version'' of President Bill Clinton's regulations that sought to bar federal agencies from awarding contracts to companies with a record of breaking labor, environmental or consumer laws. President George W. Bush vacated those regulations soon after taking office.
 ''We strongly opposed the Clinton blacklist regulations,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''and this appears worse than that.'' 
 On Feb. 2, Senator Susan Collins of Maine and four other Republican senators sent a letter to Peter R. Orszag, director of the White House budget office, saying, ''We are concerned that the imposition of these requirements, during a time of significant economic turmoil in the private sector and tight federal budgets, could have serious, negative consequences, especially for our nation's small businesses.''
 One signer was Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, who was one of the two main sponsors -- the other was Senator Barack Obama -- of a bill that sought to increase the transparency and accountability of federal contracting by requiring the government to create a data base of all federal contracts. President Bush signed it into law in 2007. 
 David Madland, director of the American Workers Project at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group founded by Mr. Podesta, argues the new policy could lower government costs, instead of raising them.
 Many low-wage employees of federal contractors receive Medicaid and food stamps, he said. Citing studies conducted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and by academic researchers, he said that contractors that pay their employees well have greater productivity and reliability, while contractors with a record of labor law violations do shoddier construction work.
 ''This policy is good for workers, it's good for taxpayers and it's good for high-road businesses,'' Mr. Madland said.
 He said that one study done by the state of Maryland found that after the state began requiring bidders to pay a living wage, the number of bidders per contract rose by a third on average. Some higher-wage companies said they began seeking government bids because the new policy leveled the playing field. 
 One federal official said the proposed policy would encourage procurement officers to favor companies with better compensation packages only if choosing them did not add substantially to contract costs. As an example, he said, if two companies each bid $10 million for a contract, and one had considerably better wages and pensions than the other, that company would be favored.
 Some supporters of the new procurement policy -- and even some opponents -- say Mr. Obama could impose it through executive order. They assert that the president has broad powers to issue procurement regulations, just as President John Kennedy did in requiring federal contractors to have companywide equal employment opportunity plans.
 But some opponents argue that legislation would be needed because an executive order may collide with laws that require federal contractors to pay the prevailing regional wage for the type of work being done. The executive order, they fear, would call for higher wages.

HEADLINE: After a String of Political Victories, a Union Has Clout to Spare

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS

 BODY:
As the debate intensifies over what to do about Springfield's $13 billion budget deficit, a powerful labor union has given Gov. Patrick J. Quinn another big number to take into account: $1.7 million. 
 That is the amount the Service Employees International Union contributed to the governor's primary campaign, state records show. The union's largesse represented more than 25 percent of all contributions to Mr. Quinn, who edged Dan Hynes, the state comptroller, in the Democratic primary on Feb. 2.
The union's 170,000 members in Illinois include about 7,500 state workers and tens of thousands of home health care and child care workers who are paid with state money. 
 An early supporter of Barack Obama's White House aspirations, the service employees union also backed the winners in the three highest-profile state primary races this year. Besides Mr. Quinn, it sided with Alexi Giannoulias, the Democratic nominee for Mr. Obama's former United States Senate seat, and Toni Preckwinkle, who toppled Todd Stroger, the Cook County Board president. 
 ''It was a good day for us,'' Tom Balanoff, president of the union's state council, said in an interview last week. 
 The union's successes culminated a long push for prominence that has seen it become the biggest financial contributor to Illinois political campaigns. Its campaign committees, which were only bit players in local politics a decade ago, have spent more than $10 million across Illinois in the past six years, a Chicago News Cooperative analysis of state campaign finance records found. 
 The money for that politicking comes from the dues paid by a fast-growing membership of mostly blue-collar laborers, including window washers, janitors, crossing guards, school cafeteria employees, garment workers, security guards and child care providers, some making as little as $8 an hour. 
 Critics in the business community, including the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, say the service employees union contributed heavily to the governor's campaign in an obvious effort to spare its members from layoffs related to budget cuts. 
 Mr. Quinn has called for an increase in the state income tax to close the state's deficit. Through a spokeswoman, he declined to be interviewed for this article.
 The leaders of the S.E.I.U. also support an income tax increase rather than further cuts in the state payroll. 
 ''This situation has not been created by overspending,'' Mr. Balanoff said. ''This has been created by a lack of revenue.'' 
 Mr. Balanoff, 59, has witnessed the transformation of the state's work force, as well as the labor union movement, to a more service-oriented economy from heavy industry. His father was a leader of the steelworkers union on Chicago's Southeast Side. While that union's membership dwindled with the decline of manufacturing, the service employees union has more than doubled in size during the last decade. 
 Under Mr. Balanoff's leadership, spending on political campaigns has skyrocketed from barely $11,000 in 2001 to more than $2 million in 2009 and at least another $822,000 in the month before this year's primary. 
 In the last three years, the union's campaign committees surpassed the teachers' unions as the largest political donors in the state, said Cindi Canary, director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. ''They have reshaped the political landscape,'' she said. 
 But politics has not always gone smoothly for the union. It gave almost $1.8 million to the successful 2002 and 2006 gubernatorial campaigns of Rod R. Blagojevich, who as governor issued executive orders allowing the union to organize 20,000 home health care workers and about 50,000 child care workers. Once organized, the workers negotiated big increases in wages and health care benefits. 
 The close ties to Mr. Blagojevich would come to haunt the union, however, when federal authorities arrested Mr. Blagojevich and charged him with corruption in December 2008, prompting his impeachment. Mr. Blagojevich, according to federal court records, sought a high-paying union job and discussed with a union official who should replace Mr. Obama in the Senate. 
 Union leaders have denied wrongdoing, and Mr. Balanoff said last year that he was cooperating with the federal investigation. 
 But the scandal has undercut the union's efforts to portray itself as an ally of reformers in local politics. In an interview last week, Mr. Balanoff said that he remained unfazed. 
 ''I don't think it has hurt us too much,'' he said. ''We continue to be a strong voice. We play a huge role in this city in pulling together the broader progressive forces.'' 
 The union spent almost $2.5 million in the 2007 City Council election to unseat several of Mayor Richard M. Daley's allies. Anger over the mayor's support for the expansion plans of the nonunionized Wal-Mart spurred that spending. 
 In addition to campaign cash, organized labor can also deploy members onto the streets at election time to help endorsed candidates. The service employees union's campaign troops have filled the void left by the legions of public workers who once helped campaigns in the precincts in order to preserve their jobs and earn promotions. But federal corruption investigations into city, county and state hiring have effectively ended the practice of rewarding campaign workers with jobs. 
 The service employees union and its labor allies have not been able to win approval of legislation requiring that large retailers like Wal-Mart pay higher wages. Yet, the threat of more S.E.I.U. spending in next year's city election has prevented Wal-Mart's further expansion into the city.
 ''Politically, I would tell my colleagues not to risk incurring the wrath of organized labor,'' said Alderman Edward Burke (14th Ward), chairman of the City Council finance committee. 
 Alderman Howard Brookins Jr. (21st) was among the few incumbents who survived an S.E.I.U.-financed challenge in 2007. He was singled out because he supported plans for a new Wal-Mart in his South Side constituency. 
 ''The only people who have the money and the troops are the unions,'' Mr. Brookins said. 
 In 2008, the service employees union switched its focus to helping Mr. Obama become president. Nationwide, it spent tens of millions of dollars for him. 
 The euphoria of that victory quickly dissipated, in great part because the new president has been unable to win approval of legislation that would ease unionization.
 ''A lot of my people, myself included, have been very disappointed by the way things have gone in the past year,'' Mr. Balanoff said. 
 The S.E.I.U. is now concentrating on the general election campaigns for Mr. Quinn, Mr. Giannoulias and Ms. Preckwinkle. As state treasurer, Mr. Giannoulias intervened to help avert the closing of the Hartmarx clothing factory in Des Plaines, which employs S.E.I.U. garment workers. After supporting Mr. Stroger in 2006, the union backed Ms. Preckwinkle's challenge for the top county government job in the final weeks of the primary campaign. 
 Surveying the Chicago River and North Michigan Avenue from his 25th-floor office, Mr. Balanoff said the union's political involvement was about more than helping its own members. He said the S.E.I.U. had pushed for increases in the minimum wage and to expand health care, although its members already earn more than the minimum wage and have insurance. 
 ''We take a broader social approach,'' he said. ''We think we have established ourselves over the past 10 years as an independent political force.'' 
 Mr. Balanoff and Jerry Morrison, the union's top political operative in Illinois, ended the interview last week when it came time to head to another meeting -- with Mr. Quinn.

HEADLINE: As Greek Crisis Appears to Deepen, Fed Studies Wall St.'s Activities

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and SEWELL CHAN; Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Greece's problems deepened on both sides of the Atlantic as the Federal Reserve disclosed it was investigating Goldman Sachs and other banks that helped the country mask its debts, and investors grew increasingly leery of lending any more money to a nation flirting with default.
 Wall Street's role in the run-up to the debt crisis has generated criticism and calls for an inquiry from European leaders. The Fed examination is the first time American regulators will examine the highly profitable if little-known business of supplying custom-made financial instruments to strapped countries on the Continent.
 While Greece's economic troubles have transfixed world markets for weeks, its problems have snowballed in recent days as workers went to the picket lines to protest budget cuts and the government struggled to raise cash to cover what is Europe's largest budget deficit. Last year, Greece's deficit equaled 12.7 percent of gross domestic product. 
 On Thursday, the Moody's ratings agency joined Standard & Poor's in warning that it might downgrade Greek government bonds, a move that would increase the premium Athens must pay to borrow. The move comes at a precarious time for Greece, which must raise 25 billion euros ($34 billion) over the next few months to avoid a sovereign default that officials fear could cause the finances of other weak European economies to collapse. 
 In a sign of the challenges their nation faces, Greek officials also called off a planned trip to the United States and Asia aimed at interesting new investors in its bonds because of a lack of demand, according to an investment banker who was briefed on the government's fund-raising strategy. 
 The European Union has said it would come to Greece's aid only if it develops a plan to reduce its deficit by March 16, further ratcheting up the pressure.
 ''Even if they bring the deficit to zero, with interest rates at 6.5 percent and a growth rate of zero at best, Greece's debt ratio remains on an explosive path,'' said Miranda Xafa, a former executive board member at the International Monetary Fund. ''I just don't think they can raise funds from the market now.''
 Greece has suffered from large deficits for years, and until now it seemed as if big banks would always be there to bail it out. As far back as 2000 and 2001, Goldman helped Athens quietly borrow billions to mask its poor finances by creating derivatives that essentially transformed loans into currency trades that Greece did not have to disclose under European rules.
 Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress Thursday that the Fed was ''looking into a number of questions relating to Goldman Sachs and other companies and their derivatives arrangements with Greece.''
 Mr. Bernanke said the Securities and Exchange Commission was also concerned about how derivatives -- financial instruments that are largely unregulated and do not trade on public exchanges -- have contributed to Greece's problems. ''Obviously, using these instruments in a way that intentionally destabilizes a company or a country is counterproductive,'' he said. 
 The S.E.C., in a statement, said that it could ''neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation,'' but added that it was cooperating with United States and international regulators in examining ''potential abuses and destabilizing effects related to the use of credit-default swaps and other opaque financial products and practices.''
 Goldman declined to comment, citing its policy of not addressing legal or regulatory matters. But in a Feb. 21 presentation, Goldman said, ''The Greek government has stated (and we agree) that these transactions were consistent with the Eurostat principles governing their use and application at the time.'' Eurostat is the European Union's statistics agency.
 Goldman is not the only bank that supplied derivatives designed to lower deficits. In the late 1990s, JPMorgan Chase helped Italy reduce its budget gap by swapping currency at a favorable exchange rate. In return, Italy committed to future payments that were not booked as liabilities.
 A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said that Italy disclosed all of the deals to Eurostat. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, also took aim at credit-default swaps, which allow banks and hedge funds to wager on whether a company or country might default.
 Critics say the swaps have contributed to Greece's problems and increased the odds of a financial collapse. 
 ''We have a situation in which major financial institutions are amplifying a public crisis for private gain,'' he said.
 The Fed inquiry was begun about three weeks ago, according to an official involved in the investigation who was not authorized to comment publicly. Fed examiners are focusing on whether Goldman and other banks complied with guidance the Fed issued in 2007 outlining how to manage the risk of complex financial vehicles. The investigation is still in its early stages, he added, as officials sift through records detailing how the derivatives were created, what compliance procedures were followed and what internal analysis was performed. The Fed is also looking at whether Wall Street made additional financial arrangements for Greece that have not been disclosed.
 Growing concern over these transactions have made investors more doubtful than ever about the government's ability to quickly secure tens of billions of euros in new financing it needs to avert default. Greece faces a critical test next week, when it will try to raise about 3 billion euros ($4 billion), through an issue of 10-year bonds. 
 But with threats of a downgrade to its sovereign debt looming, investors say Greece would need to pay a whopping 7 percent interest rate just to get people to buy. That is almost a percentage point more than the rate investors received in the previous Greek bond sale, in January, and a full 3 percentage points more than Greece's borrowing cost before the current crisis.
 A spokeswoman for the Greek Finance Ministry did not respond to a request for a comment.
 The rise in investor skepticism has led Greece to adopt a new financing strategy. Instead of selling debt through public auctions, where the danger of a failed offering could further unnerve markets, it has gone directly to institutional investors, sounding them out in one-on-one meetings, mostly in London.
 Bankers and analysts in Athens say there is a debate within the Finance Ministry as to whether the government should go to the market now, or wait until a new menu of changes -- like more taxes and further public sector wage cuts -- is announced, in the hope that such measures will result in lower financing costs.
 But a more dire view is already taking hold, according to some bankers, as investors fret that Greece may simply not be able to cover 20 billion euros of debt coming due in April and May, and 53 billion euros for all of the year. It seems unlikely that such a quantity can be raised from investors -- many of them conservative pension funds and insurance companies that are already nursing losses from the 8-billion-euro Greek bond issue in January that was hit by the recent market downturn.

HEADLINE: In Tax Law, An Overdue Overhaul

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
What is the most outrageous section of American tax law?
 ''People get a deduction for punitive damages paid in a lawsuit,'' was the response from Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the top Republican on the Budget Committee. ''I always thought that was pretty absurd. It is significantly less punitive if you get a deduction.'' 
 Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and member of the Finance Committee, pointed to a nontax item, a subsidy to oil companies for research in deep-sea drilling. ''Some of the biggest, most profitable companies in the world are getting government subsidies,'' he said. 
 The two senators introduced a bill this week, which they modestly called the Bipartisan Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2010. It may be significant less for its details than for its mere existence. Until passage of a modest jobs bill this week, cooperation across the aisle had not been a feature of the current Senate, as Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, complained in announcing he had had enough and wanted out.
 Moreover, a study of the Gregg-Wyden tax bill provides a road map to issues that Congress will have to grapple with if it tries to do something more than a quick patch of tax laws.
 There is urgency to passing a tax bill for two reasons. One is that the government is starving for money, running deficits that would have been unimaginable a few years ago. That reason, sad to say, seems to have little resonance on Capitol Hill.
 The other is a legacy of some of the least responsible tax legislation ever passed by a Congress, the 2001 and 2003 tax acts. To make 10-year cost estimates look better, and to use a Senate rule making the measures easier to pass, those tax bills had sunset provisions: at the stroke of midnight on Dec. 31, 2010, many current sections of tax law will self-destruct.
 Without legislative action, tax rates will rise across the board in 2011. The estate tax, abolished this year, will come back with a vengeance. 
 It has been almost a quarter-century since Washington produced the Tax Reform Act of 1986, with a Republican president (Ronald Reagan) and a Democratic senator (Bill Bradley) taking the lead. That bill got rid of all kinds of loopholes and special-interest provisions, and then used the extra revenue to lower rates.
 The next year, Congress began to clutter up the tax code.
 Senator Wyden and Senator Gregg have in mind a repeat of the Reagan-Bradley experience. They propose cutting the corporate tax rate to 24 percent, from 35 percent, and the top individual rate to 35 percent. To pay for that, all kinds of special sections go away.
 Those who can take advantage of lots of special provisions would lose even if rates came down. Others would benefit. 
 For those of us who don't have tax lobbyists, the list of things they want to do away with is somewhere between fascinating and outrageous. There is the ''inventory property sales source rule exemption,'' the ''deferral of active financing income'' and the ''special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve fund.'' They want to ''disallow a portion of the LIFO (last-in, first-out) inventory method for large integrated oil companies.'' And they want punitive damages to be treated the same as fines after convictions -- as nondeductible expenses for companies that are forced to pay them.
 They also want to do things that will hit home for some readers of this column, like taxing fringe benefits and no longer excluding income earned abroad by American citizens. They want to end the deferral of tax on income from United States savings bonds, and to get rid of the deduction for moving expenses.
 The bill reflects preferences of the two senators. Mr. Gregg is worried about capital formation and about reducing tax reasons for capital to flow to areas that might be less productive. Mr. Wyden wants to preserve progressivity and to assure that the tax breaks that remain are available to all. 
 One result is a change that keeps preferential tax rates for capital gains, but adjusts the computations so that people in the two lower tax brackets they propose -- 15 and 25 percent -- actually pay lower rates than do those in the upper bracket. Another is a change in the break for municipal bond interest that assures a middle-income taxpayer would get the same benefit, in dollars, as would a taxpayer in a higher bracket.
 One interesting proposal is to reduce the tax incentive for companies to borrow money by reducing the deduction for interest payments. That reduction would be based on the inflation rate, and is too complicated to explain here, but the important point to Mr. Gregg is that it could encourage companies to raise equity rather than debt.
 To be sure, there are the same kinds of tax preferences that they criticize. Small businesses -- those with revenue under $1 million a year -- are to be allowed to deduct from their income the costs of any equipment and inventory they purchase. 
 And sometimes they simply punt. They point to billions in ''direct payments and indirect subsidies to businesses each year,'' and call them ''corporate welfare.'' 
 But rather than specify which ones should be eliminated, they would direct the Congressional Budget Office to identify the least productive subsidies so that Congress could consider reducing them.
 It would be really refreshing if other legislators and the Obama administration joined in seeking to find compromises that would simplify the tax law and rip out various subsidies and preferences that have been inserted over the years. 
 Perhaps there could be a new tradition of cleaning up the code every 25 years.
 But the reality is likely to be far different. Republicans will accuse Democrats of wanting to tax and spend. Democrats will accuse Republicans of favoring the rich. We will get, in Mr. Wyden's words, ''another partisan debate about fiddling with a broken tax system.'' 
 At the last minute, some temporary measure no one likes will be passed, accomplishing nothing in the way of real change.
 If you have found the health care debate edifying, particularly the parts about death panels and illegal immigrants, you'll really love the tax squabble.
 The existence of this bill is a signal that some legislators want something much better. Let's hope they get it.

HEADLINE: Voices From the Crisis: Investigating Local Effects of Unemployment

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Students consider the scope and personal impact of the unemployment crisis by interviewing people in their communities about the local effects. 

 BODY:
Overview | Who are "the new poor," and why do some labor experts believe that many unemployed Americans will spend years waiting for new jobs? In this lesson, students consider the scope and personal impact of the unemployment crisis, as well as some ideas for fighting joblessness. They then interview people in the community about the local effects of unemployment and produce written, audiotaped or videotaped interviews to share with the larger community.
Materials | Computer with Internet access, projector and audio/visual capability; video cameras or audio recording equipment (optional).
Warm-Up | Tell students that on Feb. 24, 2010, the United States Senate passed a $15 billion bill to spur job creation. 
Ask students what the jobs bill, if enacted, may mean for your community. Ask: What kinds of jobs will the bill help create? How many local jobs might it create? How long do you think it will take from the time the bill is passed until new workers report for their first day of work? 
Next, move the conversation to programs meant to support the unemployed. Ask: What is unemployment compensation? What other programs, events or initiatives have you noticed in your area that try to help those who have run out or are on the verge of running out of unemployment compensation? What are people doing differently today to help themselves and others get through these hard economic times?
Remind students of the more than $35 million in donations that people gave to the Red Cross within days of last month's earthquake in Haiti, an amount that surpassed donations after Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami, both of which occurred in times of far greater prosperity. Have students share their observations about people's willingness to help others, in regard to Haiti or anything else.
Ask students to keep these ideas in mind as they look at the slide show "Voices of a Mississippi Jobs Program" and/or read the Op-Ed article "The Lottery in Winter," about an emergency crisis "lottery," financed by county, local charities and private donors, that helps people in need pay certain bills. For the slide show, screen the images as a class volunteer reads the captions aloud. After watching and/or reading, ask: Have you heard about any similar programs in your community or state? Which ideas might work locally and why?
Related | In "Millions of Unemployed Face Years Without Jobs," Peter S. Goodman writes about what he calls "the human toll of the recession," those "millions of Americans remaining out of work, out of savings and nearing the end of their unemployment benefits." Goodman explains the extraordinary challenge they face:
Every downturn pushes some people out of the middle class before the economy resumes expanding. Most recover. Many prosper. But some economists worry that this time could be different. An unusual constellation of forces - some embedded in the modern-day economy, others unique to this wrenching recession - might make it especially difficult for those out of work to find their way back to their middle-class lives. 
Labor experts say the economy needs 100,000 new jobs a month just to absorb entrants to the labor force. With more than 15 million people officially jobless, even a vigorous recovery is likely to leave an enormous number out of work for years. 
Some labor experts note that severe economic downturns are generally followed by powerful expansions, suggesting that aggressive hiring will soon resume. But doubts remain about whether such hiring can last long enough to absorb anywhere close to the millions of unemployed.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
Who are the people Goodman characterizes as "the new poor," and what do many of them have in common?
        
How have changes in large companies' ownership, labor unions and automation affected the number of jobs?
        
Goodman calls what happened after the recession of 2001 a "jobless recovery." How does he explain how it happened?
        
How does the current number of unemployed people compare with the number from the early 1980s?
        
What social services are in place to help people facing long-term unemployment? 
Activity | Explain to students that they will do investigative reporting on joblessness or how unemployment has affected people in their local area. 
Give them an overview of some key related issues with the following articles:

        
Health - "At Closing Plant, Ordeal Included Heart Attacks."
        
Emotional and Psychological Issues - "Poll Reveals Trauma of Joblessness in America."
        
Gender - "Women Now a Majority in American Workplaces."
        
Food - "Living on Food Stamps."
        
Family - "Jobless Turn to Family for Help."
        
Young unemployed - "Have Keyboard, Will Travel."
        
Low-income families: "The Worst of the Pain."
        
Job creation - "Lawmakers Hunt for Ways to Rekindle Hiring." and "At Issue: Counting the Jobs Created."
When they have a good sense of the issues, tell students that their task is to go out into the community and interview/observe people who can provide insights into the local unemployment situation or who have been affected by it. Students could do this individually or in pairs.
For inspiration, you might also show students all or some of the interactive feature "The Jobless, in Their Own Words"
 and the "New York on Less: Making Choices" video series. 
Possible subject ideas include people who:

        
Work at an unemployment agency or other social service agency, and those who visit the agency seeking opportunities and assistance.
        
Are part of the effort to attract new businesses to the area, like members of the Chamber of Commerce on an area business development corporation. 
        
Are enrolled in job-training programs or have returned to school in hopes of eventually finding work in a new industry, or serve as teachers in such programs. 
        
Work or volunteer at or benefit from charitable endeavors, like food banks, soup kitchens or fund-raising programs like The Neediest Cases Fund, which aim to address individuals' specific needs with donor resources. 
        
Work in a company whose staff was recently downsized.
Before students go into the field, you may review interviewing skills and reinforce the importance of respect and sensitivity. They should plan some interview questions based on what they learned about unemployment and ideas for countering it, and not only ask their subjects about their personal situations and observations, but also try to get a sense of how similar the local situation is to the national one. 
Given available resources, they can either conduct their interviews with notebooks and write up what they discovered in features or profiles, or audiotape or videotape them. 
When students have finished their interviews and visits and have written their articles, consider publishing them in a print or online anthology, or sharing them as podcasts or on SchoolTube, calling the collection "Voices From the Unemployment Crisis."
Going Further | Students hold an event to share their articles, podcasts or videos with the school community and/or the local community. 
They might invite people who have lived through past economic recessions and depressions to speak on a panel afterward, starting the discussion with the question, "What in our interviews strikes a chord with something you remember from the past?" And if desired, your class might emulate the Times series "The New Hard Times: Tell Your Own Story," by videotaping intergenerational discussions about economic hardship.

HEADLINE: Chinese Plants Starting to Feel Labor Shortage

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
Just a year after laying off millions of factory workers, China is facing an increasingly acute labor shortage. 
 As American workers struggle with near double-digit unemployment, unskilled factory workers here in China's industrial heartland are being offered signing bonuses. 
 Factory wages have risen as much as 20 percent in recent months. 
 Telemarketers are turning away potential customers because recruiters have fully booked them to cold-call people and offer them jobs.
 Some manufacturers, already weeks behind schedule because they can't find enough workers, are closing down production lines and considering raising prices. Such increases would most likely drive up the prices American consumers pay for all sorts of Chinese-made goods.
 Rising wages could also lead to greater inflation in China. In the past, inflation has sown social unrest. 
 The immediate cause of the shortage is that millions of migrant workers who traveled home for the long lunar New Year earlier this month are not returning to the coast. Thanks to a half-trillion-dollar government stimulus program, jobs are being created in the interior. 
 But many economists say the recent global downturn also obscured a longer-term trend: China has drained its once vast reserves of unemployed workers in rural areas and is running out of fresh laborers for its factories.
 Since China does not release reliable, timely statistics on employment, wages are considered the best barometer of labor shortages. And temp agencies here in Guangzhou raised their rate for factory workers this week to $1.17 an hour, from 95 cents an hour before the new year holiday.
 The rate was 80 cents an hour two years ago, before the global financial crisis temporarily depressed wages and demand. 
 The dearth of returning migrants set off a desperate scramble this week to recruit the workers who did step off long-haul buses and trains returning from the interior.
 At a government-run employment center in downtown Guangzhou, employers seeking workers outnumbered job-hunters Thursday afternoon. 
 Outside, Liang Huoqiao, a 22-year-old plastics worker, joined a small group of men and women studying a 40-foot-wide list of companies seeking workers. 
 ''You can walk into any factory and get a job,'' he said.
 The official China Daily newspaper said on Thursday that surveys of employers showed that one in 12 migrant workers was not expected to return here to Guangdong Province. Cities farther north along China's coast are also running low on labor; Wenzhou alone posted a shortage of up to one million workers.
 Guangdong provincial officials announced on Wednesday that they were considering increasing the minimum wage, which varies by city and ranges from $113 to $146 a month. 
 Higher wages could ease labor shortages by prompting factories to reduce their work forces.
 But many factories already pay well above the minimum wage. They are wary of further pay increases because it is not certain they can pass the increased costs on to their customers -- in particular, strapped importers in the United States and the European Union.
 Rising wages suggest the re-emergence of a worker shortage that was becoming evident before the financial crisis. A government survey three years ago of 2,749 villages in 17 provinces found that in 74 percent of them, there was no one left behind who was fit to go work in city factories -- the labor pool was dry.
 Mass layoffs in late 2008 and early 2009 because of the global financial crisis temporarily masked the developing shortage of industrial workers. But two powerful trends were still working to reduce the supply of young people headed for factories.
 For one, the Chinese government has rapidly expanded postsecondary education. Universities and other institutions of higher learning enrolled 6.4 million new students last year, compared to 5.7 million in 2007 and just 2.2 million in 2000.
 At the same time, China's birth rate has been sliding steadily ever since the introduction of the ''one child'' policy in 1977. 
 Labor shortages have returned quickly in recent weeks as these long-term trends have collided with a recovery in overseas demand for Chinese goods. 
 Far more jobs are available these days in China's interior. Government projects like rail and highway construction have absorbed millions of workers, particularly after Beijing allocated nearly $600 billion to economic stimulus spending in 2009 and 2010. Consumer spending is also rising briskly; auto sales more than doubled last month from a year before, and this has created many jobs in retailing, restaurants, hotels and other inland businesses.
 Even before the holiday, companies were struggling to find the employees needed to keep assembly lines running.
 At many factories, white-collar managers and engineers were forced to spend time on assembly lines to meet deadlines before the lunar New Year, because laborers were in such short supply. The managers often struggled with the tedious but intricate tasks required to make everything from toys to DVD players
 ''People working in the office, like me, have been asked to help on the factory floor,'' said Sky Niu, the sales manager at the Hengjia Electronics Company in Dongguan. ''Of course, we can only help on the simpler tasks, such as packing.''
 The labor shortage is not benefiting workers just through higher wages. Personnel managers here say they are also abandoning the informal tradition of not hiring anyone over 35 -- they say they are now hiring workers up to 40 years old, and sometimes older, despite concerns about whether they can keep up week after week with the rapid pace of Chinese assembly lines.
 It remains to be seen if Chinese factories will learn from their hiring difficulties now and be less quick to lay off workers during the next global downturn. 
 The current system ''is not stable, it's not healthy,'' said Han Dongfang, the director of the China Labor Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based group that advocates collective bargaining.
 Though the wage boost increases the prospect of inflation, it may have another more salutary aspect. The Obama administration has been pushing China to let the renminbi rise against the dollar, which would erode some of China's formidable advantage in export markets. Rising wages in China have the same effect -- while also giving Chinese families more spending power.
 Letting wages rise benefits workers, said Jing Ulrich, the chairwoman of China equities and commodities at J. P. Morgan. Letting the currency rise benefits currency speculators, she said. 
 Mr. Liang, the 22-year-old plastics worker, said that he expected his pay to double in the next five years and added that he already had set his priorities.
 ''For sure, I want to buy a car,'' he said. ''Car first, then maybe marriage later.''

HEADLINE: Council Seeks to Crack Down on Process Servers Who Lie

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
In a proposal aimed at unscrupulous debt collectors, the City Council is considering legislation that would require process servers to use global positioning systems to show that they have actually visited consumers' homes or workplaces to deliver notices of collection proceedings. 
 Lawmakers hope the measure will help curb a long-running practice known in legal circles as ''sewer service,'' which occurs when process servers fail to serve court papers on defendants but file affidavits swearing that they did so -- which allows the cases to proceed.
 The victims are often debtors involved in collection suits. When they fail to show up in court they are hit with default judgments, often for thousands of dollars.
 The bill would require process servers in New York City to electronically record every instance in which they serve or try to serve someone, using a global positioning system that would pinpoint their exact location.
 Advocates for consumers say that sewer service has grown in recent years because of the recession and an increase in the number of collection firms that buy bad debts from credit card companies for pennies on the dollar and then seek to collect them. 
 ''Obviously, there's a disturbing trend at work in New York,'' said Councilman Daniel Garodnick, a Manhattan Democrat who is the bill's lead sponsor. 
 ''Tens of thousands of people are being sued for debts that they may or may not truly owe, but they only learn that they've been sued after they've lost, and find their bank accounts are frozen and their wages are garnished.''
 A federal class-action lawsuit was filed in Manhattan in December against several debt-purchasing companies and firms that help them collect debts, accusing them of fraudulently obtaining judgments against debtors. 
 The bill was introduced amid an investigation by the state attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, into fraudulent process serving. Last year, Mr. Cuomo's office arrested the owner of a Long Island process serving firm, accusing the company's servers of frequently filing false affidavits in which they claimed to have attempted to serve three and four people at the same time.
 One server, according to the complaint, claimed to have made 77 service attempts on one day, interspersed at locations in Brooklyn and Cattaraugus County, roughly 400 miles apart -- a feat that would have required 11 round trips covering 8,194 miles. 
 The Bloomberg administration supports the Council measure. Jonathan Mintz, commissioner of the city's Department of Consumer Affairs, called the proposed bill a ''game changer'' in regulating the industry.
 ''There are a number of ways that law enforcement agencies can try to encourage process servers to do the right thing or fine them if they don't,'' Mr. Mintz said, ''but actually being able to prove if they were there is a night-and-day difference.''

HEADLINE: January Existing Home Sales Drop Despite Tax Credit

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Existing home sales fell in January, a real estate trade group reported on Friday, suggesting that a government tax credit meant to help prop up the market is having limited success. 
 Sales of existing homes fell 7.2 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.05 million, according to the report, which was released by the National Association of Realtors. That followed a similarly dreary report on Wednesday that showed the lowest level of new home sales since 1963.
 Taken together, the reports suggested the allure of the government's credit of up to $8,000 was waning after helping send sales up sharply in the fall. As a result, economists are rethinking the power of the tax credit. 
 ''You have really low interest rates, prices have dropped to the point where there are a lot of good deals out there, but you're not seeing any pickup in sales,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist for IHS Global Insight.
 Many analysts believe the surge is still to come. Americans have been known to procrastinate when it comes to finances, and some economists expect a last-minute rush as the April 30 deadline for the credit nears. A similar phenomenon played out in November when the tax credit was about to expire; Congress then voted to extend it. 
 At the same time, there is a sense that demand for homes has weakened, given that the most eager home buyers probably completed deals in the fall. In addition, mounting debt burdens, coupled with scarcer paychecks, continue to constrain Americans' willingness to spend.
 The larger question, economists say, is whether the housing market will be able to thrive -- or even hold steady -- in a post-stimulus world.
 ''It is clearly on life support,'' said Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. ''What's going to happen when the government is not there? How real is the nascent recovery? How sustainable is this?''
 Economists attributed the recent declines in home sales to high unemployment and swelling household debt. Some also pointed to unusually cold weather in December and a series of snowstorms in January.
 Those who are more optimistic about the rebound for housing note that sales remain 11.5 percent higher from the levels of January 2009 and that inventories continue to decline.
 But applications for mortgages have tumbled, dropping to the lowest level in 13 years last week. And home prices in major cities increased only slightly in December, according to one barometer, while a broader index showed prices actually falling.
 Economists expect sales to decline modestly in the summer in the absence of the tax credit, before picking up again toward the end of the year if unemployment eases.
 Just how significantly the jobs market will improve this year, however, remains unclear. The economy is still shedding jobs, and the unemployment rate reached 9.7 percent in January. 
 Economists remain wary about the prospects for growth as government stimulus fades. A separate report on Friday showed that the economy expanded at the end of 2009 at a more vigorous pace than previously thought. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5.9 percent -- the fastest pace in more than six years -- compared with an original forecast of 5.7 percent, the Commerce Department said.
 Consumer spending, a critical driver of growth that typically helps lead recoveries, continues to be tepid, dimming hopes for a fast-paced recovery. The government originally said spending rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter, but it revised that number to 1.7 percent.
 The fourth quarter's energetic pace was primarily the result of businesses easing the reduction in stockpiles. Inventories fell by $16.9 billion in the quarter, compared with the $33.5 billion drop originally reported. 
 The economy also got a lift from more robust business spending, which climbed 6.5 percent, compared with an original forecast of 2.9 percent. Even as they remained hesitant to hire, employers took small steps toward expanding, buying items like software and equipment.
 Growth was held back by a greater-than-expected swelling of the trade deficit, as manufacturers and other relied on imported goods to rebuild their businesses. The deficit widened to $40.2 billion in December -- its highest level in a year -- a 10.4 percent increase from November. Helped by a weak dollar, exports have grown rapidly in recent months, but not fast enough to overtake the pace of imports.
 Economists expect growth to be muted in the coming quarters -- moving forward at about 2 or 3 percent -- as businesses reduce their inventories at a quicker pace and stimulus programs disappear. 
 ''There was nothing here to change anyone's mind about the future,'' wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, a consulting firm. ''The most important factors limiting growth will be a less supportive policy stance and households continuing to struggle with ravaged balance sheets and lingering labor market weakness.''

HEADLINE: As a Derby Favorite Soars, His Owner Stumbles

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
Ahmed Zayat was the nation's leading thoroughbred owner two years ago, and many of his 200-plus horses frequently visit the winner's circle in the nation's biggest races. In fact, one of his colts, Eskendereya, is the early favorite to win the Kentucky Derby after running away with the $250,000 Fountain of Youth Stakes in Florida last Saturday.
 But even as his horses have excelled on the track, Zayat has struggled to keep his empire afloat, becoming entangled in legal and financial troubles. He perhaps has also run afoul of racing officials because of a relationship with convicted bookmakers. 
 In a lawsuit filed in December, Fifth Third Bank asserted that Zayat had defaulted on $34 million in loans. Zayat countersued, saying that Fifth Third's officers employed ''misleading, deceptive, and predatory practices.'' 
 This month, he filed for bankruptcy protection for his Zayat Stables.
 He said that he always intended to pay back the money but that Fifth Third did not honor a promise to restructure the loan.
 ''They lied to me and put me close to financial ruin,'' said Zayat, who lives in Teaneck, N.J. ''I'm trying to reorganize until the market corrects itself, and they are trying to put me out of business. But I'm not going to go away.''
 Lawyers for Fifth Third declined to comment.
 Zayat's bankruptcy filings, as well as his public comments about the case, have also demonstrated his flamboyant, passionate and competitive nature. 
 A self-described entrepreneur, Zayat built a beer distributorship, Al Ahram Beverages Company, in Egypt, his home country. In 2002, Heineken bought the company for $280 million. Zayat remained chairman of the company until 2007, but by then he had become among North America's biggest spenders at horse auctions. 
 Zayat bought his first horses in 2005. In 2006, he paid $4.6 million for a yearling he named Maimonides, after the medieval Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides, with the hope of promoting peace among Arabs and Jews, he said. 
 Soon Zayat's horses were winning some of the most prestigious races in the United States. In 2008, Zayat Stables won nearly $6.9 million to lead all American thoroughbred owners in earnings, and in 2009, he campaigned Pioneerof the Nile, the runner-up in the Kentucky Derby. 
 Last year, Zayat continued to spend at auctions even as his financial troubles grew, paying $24.5 million for 77 horses, according to BloodHorse.com.
 Among the money Zayat says he is owed is $155,000 he lent to Michael Jelinsky on Nov. 27, 2006, and $450,000 he lent to Jeffrey Jelinsky on Sept. 27, 2007.
 Last May, the Jelinsky brothers pleaded guilty to illegal bookmaking in Las Vegas. In the federal plea agreement, the brothers said they had operated an illegal gambling business out of Nevada in 2006 and 2007. Michael Jelinsky was sentenced to 15 months in prison, and Jeffrey received 21 months; together they forfeited nearly $5 million seized by authorities.
 Zayat freely acknowledges that he is a big bettor, but he says that the $605,000 is not owed to him from wagering. He said he had lent money to the Jelinksys because he had known their father. Zayat said one brother needed the money because he was going through a divorce and the other was having financial problems.
 ''I was trying to help them out,'' Zayat said. 
 Beyond being out $605,000 from the two loans, Zayat could be in violation of racing regulations. For example, in New York and California, two jurisdictions where Zayat frequently runs his horses, rules prohibit licensed owners, trainers and racetrack personnel from associating with convicted felons or known bookmakers.
 Neither New York nor California racing officials said they were investigating Zayat's association with the Jelinsky brothers.
 The Jelinskys, according to the plea agreement, accepted wagers from bettors across the nation -- including many who bet substantial amounts. The Jelinskys would then either hold the bets themselves, or hedge their risk by placing them through off-shore accounts or at the sports books at the Palms and Poker Palace casinos in Las Vegas.
 Among the money confiscated by federal authorities from casino safe-deposit boxes and banking accounts held by the Jelinskys was $1.5 million found in accounts of International Racing Group, a Netherlands Antilles-based betting shop that caters to high rollers. Off-shore betting operations like I.R.G., which is known as a rebate shop, offer 4 percent to 10 percent back on every dollar wagered, win or lose.
 In January 2005, I.R.G. was named in an indictment brought by the Justice Department. Fourteen people, including three alleged associates of New York organized crime families, pleaded guilty to running an illegal gambling operation.
 I.R.G. was one entity through which the group operated, according to the indictment. But no one from I.R.G. was charged.
 Six months later, in June 2005, Youbet.com, a horse racing account wagering company, bought I.R.G. and its affiliated company It's All Good Buddy, for $3 million. In October 2007, authorities raided Youbet's Los Angeles headquarters. By March 2008, I.R.G. was closed and Youbet said that it was cooperating with authorities.
 Zayat said he had never been contacted by law enforcement authorities about the Jelinskys or their involvement with I.R.G.
 He says his focus now is working out a settlement with Fifth Third so he can return his breeding and racing operation into a dominant, and money-making, operation.
 ''I have a very good plan to reorganize,'' he said. ''What's going on is not anything different than what is happening in the world economy. The market will correct itself. I'm not going anywhere.''

HEADLINE: Dreams of a Unified Northwest Are Halted at the Border

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
BLAINE, Wash. -- The Winter Olympics have made for strange days here in what many call Cascadia.
 In a region that has spent decades trying to transcend its international border, the Games increased optimism that British Columbia and this northwest corner of the United States would draw closer, deepening environmental, economic and cultural connections. Yet the Olympics have been a reminder that since Sept. 11, 2001, the border has become more rigid than ever, and dreams of a united Cascadia remain just that.
 ''The place is a whole,'' said David McCloskey, a retired professor of sociology at Seattle University and one of Cascadia's earliest advocates, ''but it's chopped up.'' 
 New factionalism has emerged. The northern constituency has startled some residents by draping itself in a foreign flag, alternately swaggering and fretting about ''owning the podium'' on behalf of something called Canada. Meanwhile, residents in the southern reaches now need passports just to get around. And when many want to catch the Games on television, the broadcasts are tape-delayed -- even though the events are being played here in the homeland.
 ''I warned my daughter,'' said Debbie Wildeman, an American who initially thought she and her Canadian husband had found the perfect place to live when they settled here in Blaine, just inside the United States border. ''Don't marry a Canadian.''
 Had Mr. McCloskey and his allies had their way, the border might not be there at all. For decades they preached of a distinct ''bioregion and eco-culture'' reaching roughly from southeast Alaska through inland British Columbia and down to Northern California. Pristine peaks, cascading waterfalls and a shared way of relating to it all would transcend national boundaries through what Mr. McCloskey called ''a swearing allegiance to a life in service of the place.''
 Purists (and parodists) still talk of secession, from both countries, and Mr. McCloskey still has flags he designed for the nation that would be. Yet while he once ran a nonprofit in service of the cause, the Cascadia Institute, others saw money to be made. 
 Business leaders and elected officials took the Cascadian dream and worked to make it a brand, a cross-border powerhouse of trade and tourism tilted toward Asia, the Arctic and the new, all to be linked by high-speed rail, a green economy and a sense of independence from Ottawa and Washington. Mayors and regional planners attended conferences during the 1980s and 1990s. A journal, The New Pacific, began publishing out of Vancouver. As the Canadian city pursued the 2010 Games, legislatures in the Northwest United States passed resolutions in support. Boosters predicted a boom south of the border.
 And at dawn on the day the Olympics opened, Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington met Premier Gordon Campbell of British Columbia at the Blaine crossing as part of the Olympic torch relay -- the only time the torch crossed into the United States. Both urged visitors to Vancouver to take a ''two-nation vacation.''
 Yet as of last June, anyone entering the United States by land from Canada must show a passport, including United States citizens. Border crossings often take longer even as their number has declined. 
 ''It's fear,'' said Mike Harward, who has been running a van shuttle across the border from a partly empty shopping center in Blaine. ''Fear of the border.''
 Ms. Gregoire and Mr. Campbell have tried to help, developing programs to help travelers cross the border more easily, including a special driver's license that allows certain residents to cross without a passport. For the Olympics, both the Canadian and United States ports of entry have kept far more checkpoints open than usual. A huge, cross-border security effort has improved communications, officials on both sides said.
 The governor and premier share goals on environmental policy and want more trade. Tourism officials have held joint events during the Games, and experts met to discuss improving cross-border cooperation. There have been recent successes. A second daily Amtrak train has been added between Seattle and Vancouver during the Olympics and is expected to continue, and the federal government has offered nearly $600 million toward high-speed rail in the region.
 Even though overall vehicle traffic has been somewhat higher at times during the Olympics, it has also dipped below normal at others. Lines at Blaine, the busiest West Coast crossing with Canada, have sometimes been nonexistent, going both ways. Amid a global recession, many businesses from Blaine to Bellingham and Seattle say they have seen little if any uptick. 
 ''I'm not convinced in the recession we're in that we're going to see as much as we hoped to,'' Ms. Gregoire said before the torch ceremony. But, she added, the Games will help ''begin the process of promoting the Pacific Northwest internationally: 'Come to British Columbia. Come to Washington State.' ''
 Yet Cascadia remains elusive. A few Web sites still promote the idea. ''Ecotopia,'' a 1975 novel by Ernest Callenbach that helped inform Cascadian thinking (but excluded British Columbia), has found a new audience as environmental awareness increases, and Joel Garreau's ''The Nine Nations of North America,'' published in 1981, which unites parts of British Columbia and the West Coast into an environmentally minded whole, can still be tracked down.
 Mr. McCloskey, who once traveled Cascadia regularly, has moved to its southern fringe, Eugene, Ore. He has stashed away the first maps he drew of Cascadia, some of which are still cited by advocates for regional cooperation and planning, but he still follows the efforts at regionalism. He was pleased to learn that the United States Board on Geographical Names last fall declared that the three bodies of water that merge where Canada meets Washington State -- Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia -- are now collectively called the Salish Sea.
 He said he had not paid much attention to the Olympics, but he did like ''that fly-in at the beginning of the show each night, up the mountains and out to the sound, the whale backs. You think, 'God, this is an incredible place.' ''
 It is a more complicated one, too.
 ''I just got a passport last year,'' Mr. McCloskey said, ''so I could go up and see my buddies.''

HEADLINE: In France, Gendarmes Are on Patrol Against Oyster Rustlers

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: GUJAN-MESTRAS, France 

 BODY:
On a recent wintry evening, Thierry Deuet, known as Titi, and two fellow gendarmes put Ernea II, an 11-foot boat, into the dark waters of Arcachon Bay. Their mission was to patrol the oyster parks to ensure that the bulging sacks of mollusks just below the surface of the shallow waters were not winched away by thieves.
 Such crimes have been reported as far back as 1883, but thefts had been declining in recent years as the police along the picturesque Atlantic coast have reacted with more sophisticated tools, including helicopters, radar and night-vision goggles. The authorities even reactivated a 19th-century decree appointing seafarers as ''gardes-jures'' -- informants hidden among colleagues.
 But last year, thefts in the bay quadrupled to 16 tons, from four tons in 2008. Christophe Berthelin, commander of the Arcachon gendarmerie brigade, is bracing for another increase this year. 
 The rise in oyster thefts, according to cultivators, harks back to a mysterious decimation of stocks a few years ago that hit the seed oysters, or ''naissains,'' for which Arcachon Bay is renowned. 
 Having taken three years to reach the point of sale, the 2010 crop will come from fry of 2007, when at least 40 percent of the young were wiped out in France. That, police officers say, is likely to push more rogue cultivators to risk stealing.
 Oyster theft data is not collated for France, but reports from elsewhere in the country suggest similar patterns. There is only so much that the police can do. ''How do you track or identify a stolen oyster?'' asked the commandant, Mr. Berthelin.
 Theft is just one problem for oyster cultivators, sometimes called sea farmers. Like others in rural France, they are striving to retain their roots in the face of environmental, industrial and commercial pressures.
 ''There's been no shortage of crises, especially over the last 10 years,'' said Jean-Charles Mauviot, director of the local oyster cultivators' association.
 Arcachon's first artificial oyster beds were established around 1850 to sate growing demand for the lipid-rich delicacy. Queen Marie Antoinette was reputedly a slurper.
 Today, an estimated 2,600 companies in France cultivate 130,000 tons a year, 95 percent of European production, bringing 630 million euros ($854 million), in revenue, according to the national producers' association. 
 China produces 70 percent of the global harvest, much of which ends up in bottled sauces. South Korea, Japan and the United States are also major players. 
 As is often the case with rural enterprises, the industry here has been volatile.
 Arcachon Bay's native flat oysters were almost wiped out in the 1920s, probably by a parasite, Mr. Mauviot said. The Portuguese oyster, which had replaced flat oysters as the cultivators' mainstay, was almost eradicated in the early 1970s by oyster gill disease, apparently linked to products used to break down oil spills.
 Thereafter, the hardier Pacific oyster was introduced; it remains the predominant breed in the bay and globally. It, too, was threatened in the 1970s by contamination from tributyltin, a chemical now banned but previously used in marine paints.
 That depleted stocks through the early 1980s.
 The bay has also endured major oil spills -- by the Amoco Cadiz in 1978 and the Prestige in 2002 -- and was battered by savage storms in 1999 and 2009, wreaking havoc on parks and equipment. These events pulled market share away from Arcachon to bigger concerns in the Marennes-Oleron, Normandy and Brittany regions of France.
 Arcachon, however, remains an important area for hatching and reselling immature oysters. About 300 cultivators work its shores, down from 2,000 during the 1960s. They perfected a technique for capturing and nurturing larval oysters on rounded, coated clay tiles. 
 Despite the industry's fragility, the French remain avid consumers, usually eating them raw with lemon juice or shallot-infused vinegar and a glass of white wine. Like foie gras, oysters are integral to end-of-year menus.
 The thieves here, however, are not consumers, but usually fellow, strapped farmers, according to the producers, the police and prosecutors.
 Sometimes the hauls are further cultivated or sold through normal channels; some thefts are apparently false, reported to lower tax bills. 
 Similar, but more modest, thefts have been reported in Australia, Britain, New Zealand and the United States. Stealing the weighty sacks requires a flat boat, winching equipment, storage, possibly a tractor and tidal knowledge. The mollusks are taken at night and often transferred to the owner's park. The period when most thefts occur is before Christmas and the New Year, when oystermen sell as much as 70 percent of their annual crop.
 The returns of thieves may be modest -- a few thousand euros for a 1,100-pound haul -- but the costs to cultivators are great when years of work is wiped out in hours. Fines for those caught are minimal, typically 1,500 euros ($2,043); prison sentences are rare, and those convicted normally re-enter the profession, because the judicial arsenal remains limited and has not responded to the increase in crime. 
 All of this takes a toll on fishermen like Jerome Delarue, 43, a cultivator since his 20s who has had mollusks stolen. Burdened by debt, which he took on at high interest rates before the financial crisis to buy his cabin, boat and equipment, he said he was close to quitting. ''We used to do all right, but now,'' he said, his voice trailing off. ''It's hard. I can't see a great future.''
 He starts early and often works till 10 p.m., heading out in a flat boat most days to his concession, where the oysters mature in mesh sacks holding about 150 each, resting on long tables. Each oyster is cleansed in a basin on land and repackaged several times annually. He also travels to regional markets, selling directly.
 Despite the travails of the industry, the price of local oysters has been relatively stable over the last decade, rising and falling only slightly with the bans and scarcity; bay oysters fetch about $4 or $5.50 a dozen at local markets. 
 Mr. Delarue fears that the decimation will at some stage drive the price up to the point where thrifty French consumers will no longer be willing to indulge as frequently.
 ''Let's see what happens this summer,'' Mr. Delarue said, referring to a recent victory that cultivators won after the government introduced a new, more reliable form of testing, which it is hoped will reduce the number of temporary bans.
 He thinks the recent decimation of naissains was caused by a virus that had always been in the oysters but was amplified by changing water temperatures and the shorter duration of low tides. Others point to unidentified algae or toxins, possibly coming from the Eyre, a river that feeds the bay after running through the Landes, an agricultural region.
 There are other human pressures. During the summer, the population explodes. Arcachon has sprawled and towns now ring the bay, host to at least 10,000 boats. Wealthy vacationers have invaded Cap Ferret, a fragile spit of white sand guarding the bay from the Atlantic swells. Aside from tourism and oysters, the main employers are the struggling boat maker Couach and a paper mill.
 Scientists are testing baby oysters to identify genetically resistant families; results are not expected for some years. But many in Arcachon fear that process will irrevocably alter the local industry, with fry being bred at large sites up the coast and shipped to the bay for ''finishing.''
 ''We really need to reflect on this.'' Mr. Mauviot said. ''Do we want to go to an industrialized model or do we want to protect the 'artisanal' ways? By doing that, we can better protect jobs, the environment and the local economy.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Feb. 27 about rising thefts of oysters along the Atlantic coast in France misstated the size of the Ernea II, the boat that French gendarmes were using to patrol the oyster beds along Arachon Bay. It was 10 meters long, not 11 feet.

HEADLINE: Too Many Choices: A Problem That Can Paralyze

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TAKE my younger son to an ice cream parlor or restaurant if you really want to torture him. He has to make a choice, and that's one thing he hates. Would chocolate chip or coffee chunk ice cream be better? The cheeseburger or the turkey wrap? His fear, he says, is that whatever he selects, the other option would have been better.
 Gabriel is not alone in his agony. Although it has long been the common wisdom in our country that there is no such thing as too many choices, as psychologists and economists study the issue, they are concluding that an overload of options may actually paralyze people or push them into decisions that are against their own best interest.
 There is a famous jam study (famous, at least, among those who research choice), that is often used to bolster this point. Sheena Iyengar, a professor of business at Columbia University and the author of ''The Art of Choosing,'' (Twelve) to be published next month, conducted the study in 1995. 
 In a California gourmet market, Professor Iyengar and her research assistants set up a booth of samples of Wilkin & Sons jams. Every few hours, they switched from offering a selection of 24 jams to a group of six jams. On average, customers tasted two jams, regardless of the size of the assortment, and each one received a coupon good for $1 off one Wilkin & Sons jam.
 Here's the interesting part. Sixty percent of customers were drawn to the large assortment, while only 40 percent stopped by the small one. But 30 percent of the people who had sampled from the small assortment decided to buy jam, while only 3 percent of those confronted with the two dozen jams purchased a jar.
 That study ''raised the hypothesis that the presence of choice might be appealing as a theory,'' Professor Iyengar said last year, ''but in reality, people might find more and more choice to actually be debilitating.''
 Over the years, versions of the jam study have been conducted using all sorts of subjects, like chocolate and speed dating. 
 But Benjamin Scheibehenne, a research scientist at the University of Basel in Switzerland, said it might be too simple to conclude that too many choices are bad, just as it is wrong to assume that more choices are always better. It can depend on what information we're being given as we make those choices, the type of expertise we have to rely on and how much importance we ascribe to each choice.
 Mr. Scheibehenne recently co-wrote an analysis, to be published in October in The Journal of Consumer Research, examining dozens of studies about choices. One problem, he said, is separating the concept of choice overload from information overload.
 In other words, he said, how much are people affected by the number of choices and ''how much from the lack of information or any prior understanding of the options?'' 
 I know this from experience. A while back, I spent a great deal of time trying to decide which company should provide our Internet, phone and television cable service. I was looking at only two alternatives, but the options -- cost, length of contract, present and future discounts, quality of service -- made the decision inordinately difficult. 
 This was not only because I wanted to get the best deal, but because the information from the companies was overly complicated and vague. I suspected that both companies were less interested in my welfare than in getting my money -- and I didn't want to be a sucker. This was a problem partly of choice overload -- too many options -- but also of poor information.
 Research also shows that an excess of choices often leads us to be less, not more, satisfied once we actually decide. There's often that nagging feeling we could have done better.
 Understanding how we choose could guide employers and policy makers in helping us make better decisions. For example, most of us know that it's a wise decision to save in a 401(k). But studies have shown that if more fund options are offered, fewer people participate. And the highest participation rates are among those employees who are automatically enrolled in their company's 401(k)'s unless they actively choose not to.
 This is a case where offering a default option of opting in, rather than opting out (as many have suggested with organ donations as well) doesn't take away choice but guides us to make better ones, according to Richard H. Thaler, an economics professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, and Cass R. Sunstein, a professor at Chicago's law school, who are the authors of ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness'' (Yale University Press, 2008). Making choices can be most difficult in the area of health. While we don't want to go back to the days when doctors unilaterally determined what was best, there may be ways of changing policy so that families are not forced to make unbearable choices.
 Professor Iyengar and some colleagues compared how American and French families coped after making the heart-wrenching decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment from an infant. In the United States, parents must make the decision to end the treatment, while in France, the doctors decide, unless explicitly challenged by the parents. 
 This contrast in the ''choosing experience,'' she wrote, made a difference in how the families later coped with their decisions. 
 French families weren't as angry or confused about what had happened, and focused much less on how things might have been or should have been than the American parents.
 It is important to note that no one is suggesting that parents be kept out of the loop in such a crucial matter. Rather, the choice, as Professor Iyengar said, was between ''informed choosers'' and ''informed nonchoosers.''
 Since, fortunately, most of our decisions are less weighty, one way to tackle the choice problem is to become more comfortable with the idea of ''good enough,'' said Barry Schwartz, a professor of psychology at Swarthmore College and author of ''The Paradox of Choice'' (Ecco, 2003). 
 Seeking the perfect choice, even in big decisions like colleges, ''is a recipe for misery,'' Professor Schwartz said. 
 This concept may even extend to, yes, marriage. Lori Gottlieb is the author of ''Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough'' (Dutton Adult, 2010). Too many women -- her book focused on women -- ''think I have to pick just the right one. Instead of wondering, 'Am I happy?' they wonder, 'Is this the best I can do?' ''
 And even though we now have the capacity, via the Internet, to research choices endlessly, it doesn't mean we should. When looking, for example, for a new camera or a hotel, Professor Schwartz said, limit yourself to three Web sites. As Mr. Scheibehenne said: ''It is not clear that more choice gives you more freedom. It could decrease our freedom if we spend so much time trying to make choices.''

HEADLINE: Shares Creep Higher as Investors Slough Off Bad News

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market edged mostly higher on Friday in spite of some downbeat economic news.
 The latest bad news came from several corners, including the financial industry. The American International Group reported a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss as its primary insurance business was hurt in part by the economy.
 The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously occupied homes fell 7.2 percent in January. It was the second consecutive month with a big drop, and analysts had predicted a gain. Two days ago, the Commerce Department said that new-home sales fell last month. 
 Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's economy grew at a faster rate than initially estimated in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
 The stronger growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was welcome news but analysts say much of the gain is tied to businesses rebuilding inventories. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, above the 5.7 percent previous estimate. Growth is expected to slow in the coming quarters. The mixed reports added to investors' confusion about the economy. Though down this week, the major indexes posted their best month in February since November. 
 ''We're in a time period where the range of potential outcomes is probably wider than it's been for some time,'' said Colleen Supran, a portfolio manager at Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough in San Francisco. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.23 points, or 0.04 percent, to 10,325.26. It fell 0.7 percent for the week but rose 2.6 percent for the month. That was the best run since it rose 6.5 percent in November.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.55 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,104.49. It fell 0.4 percent for the week and climbed 2.9 percent in February. 
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.04 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,238.26. It fell 0.3 percent for the week. For February, the gain came to 4.2 percent.
 Bond prices rose, pushing yields lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 5/32 to 100 3/32, and the yield fell to 3.61 percent, from 3.63 percent late Thursday.
 The dollar fell against other major currencies. Gold rose.
 Crude oil rose $1.49 to $79.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Trading volume was light Friday in part because of a storm in the Northeast. 
 Investors were unwilling to make big moves ahead of economic reports next week. Most important, the Labor Department is expected to release its February payrolls report on Friday. Reports are also due on personal income and spending, manufacturing, construction spending and home sales.
 The report from A.I.G. brought a reminder of the strains that still exist in the financial system. A.I.G. said it lost $8.87 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. That's improved from a year earlier but weaker than analysts expected. Shares of A.I.G. fell $2.74, or 10 percent, to $24.77.
 The private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners said it was planning to acquire the parent of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's restaurants. The offer for CKE Restaurants totals $619 million in cash and $309 million in debt. Analysts like to see takeovers because it is a sign of confidence in the economy. CKE rose $2.46, or 27.6 percent, to $11.37.
 Meanwhile, a fifth consecutive monthly increase in the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index provided some hope about the strength of manufacturing. The Chicago PMI rose to 62.6 in February, from 61.5 in January.

HEADLINE: Clueless in Kentucky

 BODY:
Kentucky has lost about 60,000 jobs since the end of 2008. In December, its unemployment rate stood at 10.7 percent, the highest since 1983. So what exactly is going on in the minds of Kentucky's two Republican senators, Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning? 
 This week, Mr. Bunning single-handedly shot down a one-month extension of unemployment benefits, along with a federal subsidy for the unemployed to maintain health coverage. Two weeks earlier, Mr. McConnell, the minority leader, objected to a one-week extension to give senators time to draft a longer-term package.
 It should be a no-brainer to extend unemployment insurance when around 1 out of every 10 workers is unemployed. Standard unemployment benefits end at 26 weeks, yet 6.3 million workers have been out of work for more than 27 weeks. Congress has provided a series of extensions, and without another one, 400,000 people will lose their benefits in a matter of weeks.
 Senator Bunning once cared about the unemployed. When the benefit was due to expire in November, he joined a unanimous vote to extend it until the end of February. ''Kentucky has been hit hard by the current economic downturn,'' he said at the time. It still is, but Mr. Bunning refused to consider the extension unless it was paid for with funds from the fiscal stimulus plan. For years, Mr. Bunning didn't seem to have a problem with blowing up the deficit for the Iraq war and tax cuts. Now he's a deficit hawk when it comes to average Americans.
 Maybe he's preoccupied. At one point during a debate on the issue Thursday night, he complained about missing the Kentucky-South Carolina basketball game.
 Democrats must now defeat Republican attempts to lace the benefits extension with things like protecting the rich from the estate tax. To avoid a repeat of this nonsense every few weeks, unemployment benefits should be extended until the end of the year. Perhaps by Monday somebody can educate Senators Bunning and McConnell about Kentucky's unemployment rate.

HEADLINE: Democrats to Press Health Bill With Simple Majority

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Seeing no prospect of a bipartisan agreement on health care, Congressional Democrats said Friday that they would make another effort to pass sweeping health care legislation on their own.
 If anything, Democrats said, their seven-hour meeting with President Obama and Republicans on Thursday confirmed their belief that it was futile to try to work with Republicans on a major health care bill because the philosophical differences between the parties were too profound.
 Accordingly, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, Democrats in the House and the Senate have begun work on a bill that they hope could be passed in the Senate by a simple majority. 
 Under the tentative plan sketched by Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats, the House would pass the health care bill approved in December by the Senate, and both chambers would approve a separate package of changes using a parliamentary device known as budget reconciliation. The legislation would revise the Senate health bill to reflect compromises between House and Senate Democrats and suggestions by Mr. Obama.
 Democrats acknowledged that at the moment they did not have the votes for the reconciliation maneuver, which is intended to avoid the threat of a filibuster and the need for a 60-vote majority in the Senate.
 ''What you call a complicated process is called a simple majority,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''And that's what we're asking the Senate to act upon.''
 Democratic leaders said Republican intransigence could help them round up the votes of wavering centrists in their own caucus. Republicans adamantly oppose the health care bill, as well as the use of any parliamentary shortcuts.
 The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said Friday that Mr. Obama would ''make an announcement next week about the way forward'' on health care. Mr. Gibbs declined to provide details.
 Ms. Pelosi described the steps she had in mind, saying: ''What is the substance? That's what we will be putting together, and we didn't want to do that before we could hear from our Republican colleagues yesterday. Secondly, what is the Senate able to do with a simple majority? And then we will act upon that.
 ''I believe that we have good prospects for passing legislation,'' said Ms. Pelosi, of California.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and an architect of the Senate health bill, said he was ''not a great fan'' of using the budget reconciliation procedure.
 ''But,'' Mr. Dodd said, ''the issue trumps the process. Would you drop doing health care altogether because you do not like the process? I don't think so.''
 Mr. Dodd said it was difficult for him to take seriously the latest Republican proposals because they would cover just three million uninsured people, about one-tenth as many as the Democrats' legislation.
 Ms. Pelosi mocked the Republican proposals, saying they were too limited to be effective.
 ''Incy Wincy Spider, little teeny tiny, you can't do it,'' the speaker said. ''There are certain things, unless you do them together, it doesn't have the impact, it doesn't have the synergy, it doesn't hold the insurance companies accountable.''
 Mr. Dodd dismissed Republican demands that Democrats start from scratch.
 ''That may be an appropriate answer for a narrow constituency,'' he said. ''But it just does not make sense for most people, who have watched their rates go up in the last year.''
 Democratic leaders hope that both chambers can complete action by March 26, when Congress is scheduled to begin its spring break. But, like many deadlines on this legislation, it could slip, leaving lawmakers to fight over health care in their midterm election campaigns.
 White House officials and their allies in liberal advocacy groups are making an all-out push to persuade Congress and the public that budget reconciliation is a legitimate procedure used often in the last 30 years to pass major legislation, including President Ronald Reagan's domestic agenda in 1981, an overhaul of welfare programs in 1996 and President George W. Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said he knew those precedents. But, he said, they amount to ''peanuts compared with this total restructuring of one-sixth of the economy.'' 
 The No. 2 Republican in the House, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, asked the House Democratic leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, to renounce use of the budget reconciliation procedure for health care. But in an exchange on the House floor on Friday, Mr. Hoyer refused to do so.
 Use of the procedure is ''in the Republican tradition,'' Mr. Hoyer said. In any event, he said, Senate rules requiring a 60-vote majority to cut off a filibuster ''are impeding the work of the American people.''
 Democrats said they would welcome Republican ideas that could be inserted into their legislation. But they made clear that they had no intention of changing the basic architecture of their bill, which would require people to carry health insurance and require many employers to help pay for it. Democrats would significantly expand Medicaid and would offer subsidies to help moderate-income people buy private insurance.
 The cost to the government, roughly $950 billion over 10 years, would be offset with new taxes and fees and cutbacks in Medicare. 
 Democrats said they would take guidance from a White House proposal issued Monday, but would try to hash out a bicameral bill of their own to get the needed votes. Ms. Pelosi said she would try to work out details in meetings with her caucus next week.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Posts Loss Of $11 Billion On Higher Claims

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The American International Group said on Friday that it lost about $11 billion last year, surprising analysts and showing the long-term risks inherent in the types of large, complex insurance coverage that the company once pioneered. 
 To increase its reserves to pay future claims, the company set aside $2.7 billion on a pretax basis, accounting for a big portion of its loss. This indicates that A.I.G. is experiencing significantly larger claims than it expected when it sold the insurance, most of it more than seven years ago, long before its government rescue in late 2008. 
 Fitch Ratings responded by putting the company's property and casualty subsidiaries on a negative watch for their financial strength ratings. Financial strength ratings are indicators of an insurer's ability to pay claims, and are separate from credit ratings. 
 Shares of A.I.G. fell nearly 10 percent Friday, or $2.74, to close at $24.77. 
 Officials of A.I.G. said claims were growing faster than reserves in just two lines of insurance and emphasized that it still had ample resources over all to pay claims. 
 A.I.G.'s chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, said in a statement that despite the losses, ''Our team has made great progress during the year in executing our strategic restructuring plan.'' The plan involves shrinking the sprawling company to a more manageable size, and generating money to repay the federal government. 
 As a bright spot, Mr. Benmosche cited a rebound in the annuities sold by its life insurance companies. 
 The insurer's 2009 result was just a small fraction of the record-breaking loss of $100 billion that it reported for 2008, when its large derivatives portfolio nearly toppled the company, leading to the government bailout. 
 Much of last year's loss came from a fourth-quarter charge taken to reflect a restructuring of its bailout -- a one-time charge that A.I.G. has been warning about for months. As part of a debt-for-equity swap with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the company removed part of its Fed loan as an asset on its balance sheet, producing a pretax charge of $5.2 billion. That charge was not connected with the company's core insurance operations.
 But the increase in reserves shifts attention to the insurance business. When insurance companies find that the reserves that they have set aside to pay future claims are inadequate, they take money from earnings to add to their reserves.
 A.I.G. said it was advised to do so by its own actuaries and outside consultants after a thorough year-end review. The step seemed to vindicate, at least in part, a study last November by the Sanford C. Bernstein & Company research firm, which found a big shortfall in A.I.G.'s reserves for its property and casualty businesses. 
 Those businesses have been renamed Chartis and are expected to be the backbone of the company after its revamping. The company said the additional reserves were all for Chartis.
 The Bernstein analyst, Todd R. Bault, had predicted that A.I.G. would have to ''take some kind of a reserve charge'' before it could offer shares of Chartis to investors, as it has said it would do to help raise money to pay back the government. He said the shortfall appeared to be in lines of insurance where claims develop slowly, over many years, like workers' compensation. 
 Two lines of business accounted for about 90 percent of the addition to reserves, according to Robert S. Schimek, Chartis's chief financial officer. They are excess workers' compensation and excess casualty insurance. 
 When a company writes excess insurance, it offers to stand behind a primary insurer, and pay claims if something so serious happens that the primary insurance is exhausted. Such events are notoriously hard to predict, and Mr. Schimek called it ''among the most complex lines of business to reserve for.'' 
 Mr. Schimek said that the company significantly reduced selling excess workers' compensation in the early 2000s. But the claims from business already on its books will take years to reveal their true cost, he said. 
 The company's best estimate of the reserves needed for all property and casualty business is now about $63 billion, he said.
 The addition to the reserves and the restructuring of its federal rescue package caused A.I.G.'s fourth-quarter results to be well off those earlier in the year, when the company had even swung to quarterly profits. For the fourth quarter, A.I.G. lost $8.87 billion, or $65.71 a share. That compared with a loss of $61.66 billion, or $459 a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast a loss of just under $4 a share.
 In his statement, Mr. Benmosche said his team was ''increasingly confident'' over the long term and the sale of its other businesses was still on track.
 A.I.G. plans to sell shares in its biggest international life insurance company, the American International Assurance Company, on the Hong Kong stock exchange this year. It has also been negotiating the sale of another international life insurance company, known as Alico, to MetLife. The talks have proceeded slowly because of questions about a possible tax liability and who would pay it, according to people briefed on the negotiations. 
 The first $25 billion in proceeds from those sales will be directed to repay the New York Fed.

HEADLINE: Chief Says I.M.F. Must Improve Response to Economic Risk

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chief of the International Monetary Fund said Friday that the organization should reorient itself to better detect systemic risks to the global economy and quickly step in with emergency loans when financial crises emerge.
 The I.M.F. leader, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also floated the idea of creating a global reserve currency that could serve as an alternative to the dollar.
 After a speech at the I.M.F. headquarters, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said in response to a question about the fiscal crisis in Greece that the fund would be ''happy to help if asked'' but that the European Union appeared able to resolve the crisis on its own. 
 ''The Europeans, especially the members of the euro zone, want to try to deal with the problems themselves,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister, said. ''I perfectly respect this.''
 The I.M.F. has collaborated with the European Union and the European Central Bank in recent days, sending experts to Athens, but the Europeans have taken the lead on demanding that the Greek government impose cuts in public spending and other austerity measures. 
 In his speech, Mr. Strauss-Kahn called for a ''renewed vision'' for the I.M.F., which was part of the global financial architecture created in Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944, but which faced grave questions about its relevance and survival by the time Mr. Strauss-Kahn took over in 2007. 
 The global financial crisis quickly turned things around. Coffers at the fund, which has 186 member nations, grew to $850 billion in the last year, an amount that Mr. Strauss-Kahn described as ''sufficient to meet demand in the coming period.''
 He called for the fund to improve its tools for financial surveillance and to ''construct a global risk map'' of nascent systemic risks. And while noting that the Federal Reserve and other central banks provided liquidity swaps during the worst of the crisis, he said that the I.M.F. should explore options like short-term credit lines for extending emergency lending in future crises. 
 He said the fund planned to triple its lending in low-income countries and to waive interest on loans to poor countries until 2012. 
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn also said it would be ''intellectually healthy to explore'' the creation of a new global reserve currency.
 The governor of China's central bank made a similar proposal in March 2009, arguing that ''special drawing rights'' -- baskets of currencies issued by the I.M.F. and made up of the euro, yen, pound and dollar that have served as reserve assets -- would be more stable and viable than the dollar. China's huge holdings of dollar reserves in the form of Treasury securities have become a concern for officials on both sides of the Pacific. 
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn said that a new reserve currency could limit dependence on the policies and conditions of a single, though dominant, country.Few economists say they believe that the dollar's status as the dominant foreign exchange reserve will change anytime soon. Mr. Strauss-Kahn said that while the fund might be called upon to provide a globally issued reserve asset some day, ''that day has not yet come.'' 
 Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard professor and a former chief economist at the I.M.F., said the idea had been a ''perennial big-think question'' for decades but remained mostly hypothetical. ''At the end of the day, you can't have a currency without a fiscal policy underlying it,'' he said in an interview. 
 Asked for a response to the remarks, the Treasury Department pointed to its most recent semiannual foreign exchange report, released in October. That report said that ''as long as the United States maintains sound macroeconomic policies and deep, liquid, and open financial markets, the dollar will continue to be the major reserve currency.''

HEADLINE: Bill to Extend Jobless Benefits Hits a Partisan Roadblock

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A partisan impasse in the Senate will cause unemployment benefits to run out for thousands of Americans beginning next week after the Senate was unable on Friday to temporarily extend the jobless pay. 
 Insisting that the unemployment money be offset by other savings rather than added to the deficit, Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, refused to allow the Senate to take up a House measure that provided another 30 days of aid and also prevented a cut in Medicare fees paid to physicians.
 ''If we can't find $10 billion somewhere for a bill that everybody in this body supports, we will never pay for anything,'' Mr. Bunning said.
 Democrats said that Mr. Bunning was stubbornly and single-handedly blocking badly needed financial aid for struggling Americans and that he was going to cause bureaucratic woes by forcing an interruption in the program. 
 ''It is really hard to understand why one senator in the United States Senate is holding up the extension of unemployment insurance at this time,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.
 Democrats intend to try to force a vote by midweek to cut off debate on the legislation if they cannot reach an agreement to approve the measure before then.
 The impact of the stalemate depends on how long the benefits are allowed to lapse. 
 Democrats said thousands of people who are out of work would be affected beginning Monday and might not be able to get back any money they lose even if the program is quickly renewed. More than one million people would be at risk if the impasse lasted through March.
 The stalled measure would also prevent a scheduled 21 percent drop in Medicare payments to doctors, raising the prospect that some physicians will not want to treat Medicare patients if their fees are cut substantially. 
 In addition, according to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, as many as one and a half million people living in rural areas might not be able to get broadcast television channels as part of their satellite television service because the impasse has blocked the extension of the law allowing satellite companies to carry those signals. 
 The dispute could also lead to a delay in some federally financed highway projects and ends at least temporarily a program providing added help with health insurance for the unemployed, the federal flood insurance program and some special loan programs for small businesses.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Judging a Stimulus by the Jobs'' (Economic Scene, Feb. 17): 
 David Leonhardt, in an otherwise balanced column, unfairly characterizes the highway and bridge spending as the ''most visible parts of the program'' and as ''sluggish.''
 The transportation investments represented only 6 percent of the $787 billion law, hardly the most visible. Arguably, they have been the most effective. 
 In the first year, 7,000 projects worth $17 billion are under construction or have been completed. That's pretty quick in our view. An additional $7 billion for highway projects has been obligated, and work is expected to begin soon. 
 Thanks to the stimulus, overall investment in highway, bridge and transit projects was up 12 percent through November 2009, and the market should continue to be stable, if not grow slightly -- absent additional state and local financing cuts -- through this year. 
 That means hundreds of thousands of Americans were able to hold jobs over the last year that would otherwise have been lost, and many more were created where market conditions made them possible. If you are in one of those families or affected companies or agencies, that's an impact -- a very positive one.

HEADLINE: Bubbles Burst, But Investors Can Be Ready

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
Financial bubbles are a way of life now. They can upend your industry, send your portfolio into spasms and leave you with whiplash. And then, once you've recovered, the next one will hit.
 Or so you might think, as a veteran of two gut-wrenching market declines and a housing bubble over the last decade. 
 There's plenty of reason to expect more surprises, given the number of hedge funds moving large amounts of money quickly around the world and the big banks making their own trades. 
 Individuals, as always, may be tempted to make their own financial bets, too. Last time, they bought overpriced homes with too much borrowed money. Next time, who knows what the bubble will be? And that's the problem, as it always is. How do you identify the next thing that will pop? Is it China? Or Greece? Or Treasury bonds? It is difficult to predict and make the right defensive (or offensive) moves at the correct moment to save or make money. 
 Still, if you want to better insulate yourself from bubbles -- however often they may inflate -- there are plenty of things you can do. Your debt levels matter, and you may want to consider a more flexible investment strategy. But perhaps most important, this is a mental exercise that begins and ends with an honest assessment of your long-term goals and how you handle the emotional jolts that come from the bubbles that burst along the way.
 FIXED EXPENSES Start with the basics. The less you have to pay toward monthly obligations, the better off you are, and that's especially true at a time of economic disruption. You certainly wouldn't want any bills increasing, so now's a good time to refinance to a fixed-rate mortgage. 
 Whittle down student loan and credit card debt, too, and pay cash for your car if possible. ''Flexibility is priceless in a time of panic,'' said Lucas Hail, a financial planner with Foster & Motley in Cincinnati. 
 SELF-RELIANCE Then take a hard look at how much you should rely on promises from the government. Social Security and Medicare may not fit the traditional definition of bubbles, but that hasn't stopped Rick Brooks from advising his financial planning clients to expect less from both programs. ''Something that is not sustainable will not continue. It just can't,'' he said of Medicare. 
 Mr. Brooks, the vice president for investment management with Blankinship & Foster in Solana Beach, Calif., said anyone under 50 should assume that Medicare will look nothing like it does now and examine private health insurance premiums for guidance as to what may need to be spent on health care in retirement. Meanwhile, the firm advises current retirees to assume a 20 percent cut in Social Security benefits at some point. 
 Bedda D'Angelo, president of Fiduciary Solutions in Durham, N.C., has an equally stark outlook on long-term employment risk. If there are two adults in the household, your goal should probably be to have two incomes instead of one. ''I do believe that unemployment is inevitable,'' she said, adding that people who think they are going to retire at 65 should save for retirement as if they will be forced out of the work force in their mid-50s.
 PORTFOLIO TACTICS Perhaps you did what you thought you were supposed to during the last decade. You got religion and stopped trading stocks. Then, you split your assets among various low-cost mutual funds and added money regularly. And the results weren't quite what you hoped.
 Tempted to make big bets on emerging markets or short Treasury bills? You've landed in the middle of the debate between those who favor a more passive asset allocation and those who prefer something called tactical allocation.
 The first camp sets up a practical mix of investments, according to a target level of risk, and then readjusts back to that mix every year or so. 
 They frown on the hubris of the tactical practitioners. To make a tactical approach work, they note, you need to know what the right signals will be to buy and sell everything from stocks to gold, during every future market cycle. Then, these tacticians need to have the discipline to act each and every time. This is extraordinarily hard.
 The tacticians, however, believe they have no choice. ''What consumers need to know is that no matter how comforting it is to believe a formulaic approach or prepackaged investment product will allow them to put their financial future on autopilot, our current and future financial environment will require advice, diligence, education and responsiveness, which takes into account strategic consideration of geopolitical and economic relationships,'' as Ryan Darwish, a financial planner in Eugene, Ore., put it to me this week. 
 Mr. Darwish scoffed at the notion of mere bubbles and said he thought that more fundamental and far-reaching shifts were under way, like the transfer of economic power from the United States to China and other nations. 
 A growing number of financial planners are embracing a middle, more measured approach: If diversification across stocks, bonds and other asset classes has proved to be a good thing in most investing environments, why not diversification around investment approaches?
 ''I am not a financial genius, but the geniuses are even worse off because they're anchored on one philosophy,'' said David O'Brien, a financial planner in Midlothian, Va. So he and a growing number of his peers have added some strategies to their baseline portfolios aimed at losing less during bubbles while still gaining in better times. ''We're not trying to shoot for the moon,'' he added.
 These tactics can include managed futures, absolute return funds, merger arbitrage and other approaches that will get their own column someday.
 The embrace of all this even led one investment professional I spoke with this week to express the ultimate sacrilege: It really is different this time. 
 Thomas C. Meyer of Meyer Capital Group in Marlton, N.J., noted that many of these alternative strategies were not even available in mutual-fund form three to four years ago. So that's different. He's now putting 30 percent of his clients' equity portfolios into such investments. 
 The big change, however, is that the baby boomer money is getting older. People are further along in their careers than they were during the market crash in 1987, and they can't rely on pensions as so many more near retirees could in the 1980s (while shrugging off stock market volatility). And the boomers don't have as much time to make up lost ground, especially if they're already retired.
 ''Losing less means a lot right now,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''So we want to suck volatility out where we can.''
 MATTER OF THE MIND But can you live with less volatility -- and the permanent end of occasional portfoliowide returns in the teens or higher? Markets run on greed and fear; bubbles expand and deflate thanks to outsize versions of each. One of the few things you can predict about bubbles is that they will test your conviction on where you sit along the fear-greed continuum. 
 And once they pop, you'll know a bit more about how your mind works than you did before. 
 This last downturn was severe enough that about 10 percent of Steven A. Weydert's clients realized that they had overestimated their own risk tolerance. ''Ideally, with an asset allocation, you never want to look back and say you're sorry,'' said Mr. Weydert of Bowyer, Weydert Wealth Planning Partners in Park Ridge, Ill. 
 So rather than trying to predict the number and type of bubbles, it may make more sense to look inward when trying to predict the future. Bob Goldman, a financial planner in Sausalito, Calif., said that clients often looked at him blanklywhen he asked them what it was they imagined for themselves in the future. Sometimes, they need to go home and figure out what sort of life it is that they're saving for -- and how much (or little) it might cost.
 ''People come in and talk about how we all know that inflation is going to explode next year,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''Well, we don't all know that. We don't know anything. But we can know something about our own lives, and there is a person we can talk to about that. A person in the mirror.''

HEADLINE: The Jobless in the New Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Despite Signs of Recovery, Chronic Joblessness Rises'' (''The New Poor'' series, front page, Feb. 21):
 You write, ''Call them the new poor.'' That might just be me. I've worked all my life for companies with management that wouldn't know loyalty if it bit them. 
 Layoffs, new jobs and career changes have been the American way for decades. So, this long period of joblessness should be no surprise -- but the ''let them eat cake'' attitude coming from government is. 
 You quote Allen Sinai, the chief global economist at the research firm Decision Economics, as saying: ''American business is about maximizing shareholder value. You basically don't want workers. You hire less, and you try to find capital equipment to replace them.''
 If that's how business defines profits, then we desperately need to redefine our priorities and our business laws. Deregulation has made us a lawless society again. It seems as if we have rebuilt a new robber-baron class that feeds on an ever-growing population of poor people. If this is the New American Dream, would someone please wake me up?
 John Thomas Ellis Kentfield, Calif., Feb. 24, 2010
 To the Editor:
 In a workshop for the recently unemployed and long-term unemployed, the first question asked by the instructor was ''Why do we work?'' The responses were obvious: income, benefits, self-esteem, satisfaction and planning for the future. The response the instructor wanted to convey was not as obvious. The instructor explained that ''work is something to do -- work is a place to go each day.'' 
 In addition to the devastating loss of income and benefits, the recession has created a different kind of loss, loss that does not have a monetary value. The unemployed have lost a sense of place, a sense of belonging and a sense of permanence. 
 Such loss has been replaced by not having clear purpose and direction, by not having social interaction with people and by not knowing what the weeks, months and years ahead will bring.
 While the economic recovery may be a sign of progress, it will come with enduring memories of great hardship.
 Harold Langus Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Feb. 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 In the 1960s, it was predicted that automation would radically change the job market, and it was suggested by some that we plan then to shift more to service jobs as well as prepare for increased leisure hours, to ease the inevitable socioeconomic transition. 
 Instead, the hours of today's working class have greatly increased, and salaries have not kept pace.
 The wealthy, however, a class that has greatly increased in both size and assets, enjoy the benefits of automation and of having funds for entertainment and for hiring help to free even more of their time. 
 Given these realities, it seems unrealistic to look only at financing more jobs. We must be honest about the situation, and we must address the increase in service-sector jobs with appropriate training and the corresponding need for increased pay for those jobs from those most able to afford it. 
 Failure to address this imbalance is leading us toward a modern form of serfdom.
 Diana Morley Talent, Ore., Feb. 21, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The well-reported article about the economic effects of unemployment did not spend enough time on one of the real problems that people face today, whether holding a job or living on a fixed income, as Jean Eisen is doing with her husband. With approximately $19,000 a year from her husband's disability, Ms. Eisen said she feared becoming homeless. 
 How is it that in much of America a decent apartment can't be found for less than $1,000? Maybe what Ms. Eisen and millions of others need in addition to a job is more affordable housing.
 Douglas Robinson Sterling, Va., Feb. 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 You are right to look at the effect of outsourcing, but shouldn't you also look at immigration? 
 During the Great Depression, leaders, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, insisted that immigration be kept below 20,000 legal immigrants a year. During today's Great Recession, leaders of both parties studiously ignore the elephant in the room: the highest immigration rates in our history!
 Legal immigration hovers at roughly 700,000 a year, higher even than the 600,000-a-year average of the previous high, the Great Wave between 1880 and 1920. 
 Add an estimated half-million illegal immigrants, and immigration hovers close to two times the previous high. We must, one assumes, create more than 100,000 jobs a month just to accommodate arriving immigrants who need work. 
 One is reminded of the old adage about the importance of turning off the faucet before mopping the floor!
 Kathleene Parker Rio Rancho, N.M., Feb. 23, 2010
 The writer serves on the board of advisers for Population-Environment Balance, a national group advocating for population/immigration stabilization.

HEADLINE: Learning From the Sin Of Sodom

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
For most of the last century, save-the-worlders were primarily Democrats and liberals. In contrast, many Republicans and religious conservatives denounced government aid programs, with Senator Jesse Helms calling them ''money down a rat hole.'' 
 Over the last decade, however, that divide has dissolved, in ways that many Americans haven't noticed or appreciated. Evangelicals have become the new internationalists, pushing successfully for new American programs against AIDS and malaria, and doing superb work on issues from human trafficking in India to mass rape in Congo. 
 A pop quiz: What's the largest U.S.-based international relief and development organization? 
 It's not Save the Children, and it's not CARE -- both terrific secular organizations. Rather, it's World Vision, a Seattle-based Christian organization (with strong evangelical roots) whose budget has roughly tripled over the last decade.
 World Vision now has 40,000 staff members in nearly 100 countries. That's more staff members than CARE, Save the Children and the worldwide operations of the United States Agency for International Development -- combined.
 A growing number of conservative Christians are explicitly and self-critically acknowledging that to be ''pro-life'' must mean more than opposing abortion. The head of World Vision in the United States, Richard Stearns, begins his fascinating book, ''The Hole in Our Gospel,'' with an account of a visit a decade ago to Uganda, where he met a 13-year-old AIDS orphan who was raising his younger brothers by himself. 
 ''What sickened me most was this question: where was the Church?'' he writes. ''Where were the followers of Jesus Christ in the midst of perhaps the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time? Surely the Church should have been caring for these 'orphans and widows in their distress.' (James 1:27). Shouldn't the pulpits across America have flamed with exhortations to rush to the front lines of compassion?
 ''How have we missed it so tragically, when even rock stars and Hollywood actors seem to understand?''
 Mr. Stearns argues that evangelicals were often so focused on sexual morality and a personal relationship with God that they ignored the needy. He writes laceratingly about ''a Church that had the wealth to build great sanctuaries but lacked the will to build schools, hospitals, and clinics.''
 In one striking passage, Mr. Stearns quotes the prophet Ezekiel as saying that the great sin of the people of Sodom wasn't so much that they were promiscuous or gay as that they were ''arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.'' (Ezekiel 16:49.)
 Hmm. Imagine if sodomy laws could be used to punish the stingy, unconcerned rich!
 The American view of evangelicals is still shaped by preening television blowhards and hypocrites who seem obsessed with gays and fetuses. One study cited in the book found that even among churchgoers ages 16 to 29, the descriptions most associated with Christianity were ''antihomosexual,'' ''judgmental,'' ''too involved in politics,'' and ''hypocritical.''
 Some conservative Christians reinforced the worst view of themselves by inspiring Ugandan homophobes who backed a bill that would punish gays with life imprisonment or execution. Ditto for the Vatican, whose hostility to condoms contributes to the AIDS epidemic. But there's more to the picture: I've also seen many Catholic nuns and priests heroically caring for AIDS patients -- even quietly handing out condoms.
 One of the most inspiring figures I've met while covering Congo's brutal civil war is a determined Polish nun in the terrifying hinterland, feeding orphans, standing up to drunken soldiers and comforting survivors -- all in a war zone. I came back and decided: I want to grow up and become a Polish nun. 
 Some Americans assume that religious groups offer aid to entice converts. That's incorrect. Today, groups like World Vision ban the use of aid to lure anyone into a religious conversation.
 Some liberals are pushing to end the longtime practice (it's a myth that this started with President George W. Bush) of channeling American aid through faith-based organizations. That change would be a catastrophe. In Haiti, more than half of food distributions go through religious groups like World Vision that have indispensible networks on the ground. We mustn't make Haitians the casualties in our cultural wars.
 A root problem is a liberal snobbishness toward faith-based organizations. Those doing the sneering typically give away far less money than evangelicals. They're also less likely to spend vacations volunteering at, say, a school or a clinic in Rwanda.
 If secular liberals can give up some of their snootiness, and if evangelicals can retire some of their sanctimony, then we all might succeed together in making greater progress against common enemies of humanity, like illiteracy, human trafficking and maternal mortality.

MISS O'DELL My Hard Days and Long Nights With the Beatles, the Stones, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and the Women They Loved. By Chris O'Dell with Katherine Ketcham. Touchstone, $26. Superficially, ''Miss O'Dell'' appears to be a typical rock memoir. O'Dell and her famous friends -- she worked for the Beatles' Apple Corps and later tour-managed some of the biggest acts of the '70s -- consume staggering amounts of substances (did Ringo really do that much coke?) before and after sleeping with one another (she says she slept with Ringo). But the character you quickly care most about -- more than Dylan, Clapton and the rest of the ''Last Waltz'' cast -- is O'Dell herself. 
She is Nick Carraway to classic rock's egotistical Gatsbys; she is, literally, the ignored ''woman down the hall'' in Joni Mitchell's song ''Coyote'' (Sam Shepard was Coyote), and it must hurt to be the one to tell us. At the same time, O'Dell manages to be endearingly self-aggrandizing, like a Jane Austen heroine. Her writing (done with Katherine Ketcham) is brisk and excellent: the moment that Maureen Starkey, cheating on Ringo with his old band mate George, produces, in front of Ringo, George's brand of cigarettes -- Marlboros -- could appear in a good novel. Sure, O'Dell bedded Mick and Bob, but who didn't. Only O'Dell would dwell longest on her relationship with the semifamous pianist Leon Russell: ''the first true love of my life, who rejected me before I had the good sense to leave.'' 
 1989 Bob Dylan Didn't Have This to Sing About. By Joshua Clover. University of California, $21.95. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, signaling new global unity and perhaps the ''end of history.'' Also in 1989, the Chinese government brutally suppressed protests in Tiananmen Square, indicating the hollowness of claims that history had come to a close. It was, Clover argues, a year of ''illusory coherence'' -- emphasis on ''illusory.'' And the best way to see all this, according to Clover, is to consider 1989's unusually diverse, innovative and influential pop music scene. An associate professor of English at the University of California, Davis (and quite obviously a man of the academy -- those allergic to jargon should stay away), Clover traces the roots of late-'80s pop music back to the economic and material circumstances of its time. For him, it is no coincidence that acid house -- a dance music requiring thousands of people wishing to lose themselves in the moment -- was spawned amid the ''postindustrial ennui and cheaper spaces'' of Manchester, England, or that the cold war in Eastern Europe concluded in the same year that saw the first No. 1 single not released on vinyl. Clover provides astute observations across several genres; his gangsta rap and grunge chapters are particularly good. But he fails to make his admittedly neat juxtapositions coalesce around a single argument about 1989. The closest he comes is his brief analysis of U2's album ''Achtung Baby,'' which was recorded in Berlin after the wall fell. Here, Clover says, Bono and company moved beyond their ''confrontational social politics'' and achieved ''a synthesis of disparate elements within the field of the moment''; the album's most resonant single is called ''One.''
 YOUR PRETTY FACE IS GOING TO HELL The Dangerous Glitter of David Bowie, Iggy Pop, and Lou Reed. By Dave Thompson. Backbeat/Hal Leonard, paper, $19.99. Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and David Bowie are the subjects, but Andy Warhol, in a supporting role, steals the show. He is the mercurial, slightly malevolent Svengali who inspired the three stars' ''dangerous glitter'' -- the campy flirtation with drugs, theatricality and bisexuality that came to define glam rock. Warhol helped establish Reed's group, the Velvet Underground, as the house band at Max's Kansas City, a venue near Union Square that one scenester remembers as ''the first really broad expression of homosexuality in New York City''; he befriended Iggy Pop early on in Ann Arbor, Mich.; and he conceived and lent his name to ''Pork,'' an extremely lewd London stage show that seems to have inspired Bowie to create his alter ego, the androgynous bandleader Ziggy Stardust. Thompson, an accomplished British music journalist, expertly teases out Warhol's influence in the book's opening stretch. After that, though, he does not explore the glam acts with enough rigor, lapsing instead into details about album production and management companies that have little apparent bearing on his central point. And he fails to pursue promising tangents: Thompson mentions that homosexuality was illegal in Britain until 1967, for example, but he omits what could have been a fruitful discussion of how Bowie challenged mores. The book is a triptych that makes you wonder why its author didn't just produce three separate portraits.
 PHISH The Biography. By Parke Puterbaugh. Da Capo, $25. With his unapologetic enthusiasm and myriad insidery references, Puterbaugh, a journalist and former editor for Rolling Stone, clearly intended his book for the jam band's diehard fans. The problem is, Phishheads already know the basics: the band's coming-of-age in mid-'80s Burlington, Vt.; bigger and bigger (though never mainstream) fame accumulated throughout the '90s; a premium on quirk, a nod to classic-rock roots and an undisputed cultural (if more disputable musical) debt to the Grateful Dead. Phishheads even know the minutiae: does Puterbaugh really need to devote 10 pages to ''Gamehendge,'' the giddily delightful eight-song cycle chronicling Colonel Forbin's quest to depose an evil despot named Wilson, when most phans already own ''Forbin for President'' T-shirts? Meanwhile, those of you who rolled your eyes at the previous sentence are missing an important story, and ''Phish'' just might help you get it. The important story is Phish's pioneering way of bringing its fans in on the joke, and its fans' pioneering use of the Internet to spread the word (Puterbaugh notes that phish.net was created as early as 1991). The important story is how Phish -- rewarding obsessiveness, trafficking in relaxed self-awareness, and blowing, straight from the Green Mountains, a cool gust of nostalgia for a time when cassette tapes of bootlegged shows were traded via snail mail -- prophetically anticipated the zeitgeist of today. Much like the band itself, ''Phish'' can be a little much. But knowing Phish's story will enrich anyone's understanding of the American scene over the past quarter-century.

HEADLINE: Talk to Me. I'll Turn Off My Phone.

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
This interview with Tachi Yamada, M.D., president of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Global Health Program, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.
 Q.How did you first learn to become a manager?
 A. I think the most difficult transition for anybody from being a worker bee to a manager is this issue of delegation. What do you give up? How can you have the team do what you would do yourself without you doing it? If you're a true micromanager and you basically stand over everybody and guide their hands to do everything, you don't have enough hours in the day to do what the whole team needs to do. 
 Learning how to delegate, learning how to let go and still make sure that everything happened, was a very important lesson in my first role in management. And that's where I learned a principle that I apply today -- I don't micromanage, but I have microinterest. I do know the details. I do care about the details. I feel like I have intimate knowledge of what's going on, but I don't tell people what to do.
 Q. How do you have a granular understanding of what somebody's working on without actually doing the work? 
 A. Every day, I read about 1,000 pages of documents, whether grants or letters or scientific articles, or whatever. I have learned what the critical things to read are. If there are 10 tasks in an overall project, what is the most critical task among those 10? What is the one thing that everything else hinges on? And what I'll do is I'll spend a lot of time understanding that one thing. Then, when the problem occurs, it usually occurs there, and I can be on top of what the problem is.
 Q.How do you develop that ability to understand the key thing?
 A. It's just having enough experience to understand when problems do occur and how they occur, why they occur, and being prepared for that particular problem. Problems can occur in the other 10 areas, but they won't determine the outcome of the overall project. But there may be one or two points where the outcome of the entire project is at stake, and there you'd better be on top of it.
 Q.What other leadership lessons have you learned?
 A. One very important partner I had in life was my father. He was a senior managing director of Nippon Steel Corporation and was one of the architects of the reconstruction of Japan after the war. He negotiated the first World Bank loan to Japan after the war to the steel industry, and it helped develop heavy industries in Japan. His outlook was always international. Very early, he sent me to the United States. I was 15. He sent me to a boarding school, Andover.
 His whole idea was that you can't possibly be competitive in the world unless you actually go outside your own geography and learn the way other people live and think. That probably was the most important lesson I learned -- that what's out there is more important than what you already know, and that you'd better go out and learn what it is out there that you don't know.
 Q. What else?
 A. A second key lesson was from a doctor named Marcel Tuchman. He was the most compassionate person I have ever met in my life -- I mean, full of human kindness. And every time he met somebody, you had the sense that he cared more about them than anything else in the world.
 So what I learned from him is that when you actually are with somebody, you've got to make that person feel like nobody else in the world matters. I think that's critical.
 So, for example, I don't have a mobile phone turned on because I'm talking to you. I don't want the outside world to impinge on the conversation we're having. I don't carry a BlackBerry. I do my e-mails regularly, but I do it when I have the time on a computer. I don't want to be sitting here thinking that I've got an e-mail message coming here and I'd better look at that while I'm talking to you. Every moment counts, and that moment is lost if you're not in that moment 100 percent.
 Q.Any other important mentors?
 A. Morton Grossman. He was one of the founders of modern gastroenterology. I remember he once gave me a paper to review. I was young at the time. He said, ''I want you to review this paper.'' So I spent a couple of evenings reading the paper and wrote a six-page review of it. I shredded the analysis. And I showed it to him, to show how smart I was.
 He looked at it and said, ''O.K., now I want you to write me a report and give me a reason why it's a fantastic paper and how we could make it even better.'' And I did. And from that viewpoint, actually, the paper wasn't bad. 
 This applies to people, too. It always comes down to people. One of the things I've learned is that you can't go into an organization, fire everybody and bring in everybody you want. You have to work with the people you have. I've gone into different organizations in completely different walks of life several times, and you walk into the organization and you realize that some people are very good, some people are average and some people are not so good. And if I spend my time focusing on everything that's bad, I'll get nothing done. 
 Or I could say, what are really the best things about the people I have? What makes them great, and how can I really improve them one or two notches? And if I spend my time on that, then I'll have a great organization. Everybody has their good points. Everybody has their bad points. If you can bring out the best in everybody, then you can have a great organization. If you bring out the worst in everybody, you're going to have a bad organization. 
 So that lesson, while it was about reviewing papers, has been a critical element of my management style.
 Q.Talk about how you hire.
 A. You have to have people in an organization who are willing to truly embrace change, because if they don't, then what you have is an organization that's constantly fighting to stay at the status quo. And, of course, that leads to stagnation. It's also an unsustainable model.
 I've made an observation about people. There are people who have moved. Take somebody who's a child of an Army officer -- they will have moved 10 times in their lives. And then there are people who've been born and raised and educated and employed in one town their whole lives. Who do you think is willing to change? I think, in this modern world, you really have to be sure that your work force has the experience of being elsewhere. That experience then has the ability to ensure that you will be comfortable with change. 
 The biggest problems I see in a group of people who don't embrace change is that they will always fight anything new, any new idea, any new concept, any outside point of view. And, of course, there are many examples of companies that have failed because of that. So I think that's a critical point. Almost all of the people on our staff have traveled all around the world, have lived everywhere.
 Q. What else are you looking for when you hire?
 A. Native intelligence is critically important. I don't think you can train people to be more intelligent.
 Q.How do you test for that?
 A. I really try to understand people, what their values are. So it's usually quite an unstructured interview -- where they come from, their family members. And then I try to understand how they deal with difficult interpersonal issues.
 Q.Why?
 A. Intelligence is often more displayed in what I would call complex abstract thinking, and there's nothing more complex and abstract than human relationships. And if they can work their way through a human relationship problem intelligently, my guess is that they're very smart people. Not that they can't add and subtract six-figure numbers multiplied by whatever, but that they can take a complex problem, breakit down into its pieces and figure out the best way forward.
 I also look for people who've moved. Did you move when you were a kid? When you went from one high school to another, what was it like? How did you deal with it? This kind of thing is often very informative about how people have had to deal with crisis, different circumstances and how they've had to adapt or change. 
 I like people who are very confident but who understand the value of other people. Often, in interviews, people will say, ''Well, I did this, I did that.'' But who were your teammates? What did they do and how did you get them involved?
 Q. Anything else?
 A. One underestimated and important value, I think, is a sense of humor. It's engaging, it's delightful, but it's also a reflection on not taking yourself so seriously -- especially if the sense of humor is self-deprecating. It gives you a sense that they understand that they're not so important.
 Q.How has your leadership style evolved?
 A. One of the things that I learned is that you have to give more of yourself than you're used to. I'm Japanese. We're very reserved people. It was very difficult for me to learn that, in order to connect with groups of people, you have to give of yourself. You have to tell people about yourself in a self-deprecating way in order to get people to hear you. And that was a very difficult thing for me early on. I just didn't know how to do that without seeming a little uncomfortable. But I learned that, too.
 Q. You've worked in organizations of very different sizes. Talk about that.
 A. I went from having a small lab with four or five people to a department of medicine with 2,500 people to an R.& D. organization that I was running with 15,000 people. Each step was a huge step. But the lessons I learned at the job with thousands of people are really, really useful in learning how to deal with the 250 people we have now.
 Q.What are those lessons?
 A. Well, it's how do you turn a battleship? You turn a battleship by making a directional commitment and staying the course, not wavering from it. When you're down to 250, you could turn this like a motorboat, but your organization is much better if you treat it like a battleship and you stay the course.
 Q.How do you give feedback?
 A. One of the things I've learned is that it doesn't matter how many good things you say, the one bad thing is what sticks. So. therefore, feedback should be viewed in the context of time, not in any one specific episode. So if I have something negative to say, I will say it. I will be clear about it. But I won't try to couch it in a lot of positives, because people have a natural tendency to not want to hear a negative message. So I try to do it as quickly as I can, and I try to do it in the moment. But I also try to give positive feedback in other moments. To try to mix the two is often very hard, because the positive messages get lost in the one negative message, and the negative message gets garbled.
 Q.What is your best career advice for young people?
 A. I think one of the hardest things to do is to figure out what your North Star is. What is it that you really are interested in? This helps you to weigh one option versus another. And then keep your eyes and ears open. 
 Be open to new challenges. I don't think anyone should do one job for too long a time. I think every five to eight years you should be willing to take on some different challenges. It's so easy to get stale. Every time I've left a job, I was loving the job that I left. But I never regretted the next move that I made. 
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Getting a Little Help To Go Out All Alone

BYLINE: By CRAIG BRIDGER

 BODY:
THE self-written solo performance has reached such ubiquity in New York that it's easy to forget how recently the genre became, well, a genre. Five years ago ''solo show'' wasn't even marketed as a separate category at the summer New York International Fringe, the city's biggest theater festival. In 2006 submissions of solo works jumped to 125, a 20 percent increase over the previous year. The spring SoloNova festival, dedicated entirely to the genre, recorded an even sharper rise: up more than a third to 109 submissions last year, from 75 in 2008. Even without a festival there were at least 15 solo shows in New York last week, from the revelatory (''Palestine'') to the masturbatory (''The Accidental Pervert'').
 And as these pieces have proliferated, a small industry of classes, workshops and teachers has sprung up to provide support -- for a fee of course -- to their creators. 
 Inside a typically grim rental studio in Midtown, white walls scuffed and dented, Matt Hoverman introduced himself to a new class: six women (an extreme example of the trend in solo work) ranging from their mid-20s to spry 60s. Mr. Hoverman, 41, with an intense brow that belies his gentle manner, told the students that he started his Create Your Own Solo Show Workshop in 2001, when he was unable to find a class for himself. (Disclosure: A former actor, I took his class in 2004). 
 Since then, he's helped to create many shows, including Cynthia Silver's ''Bridezilla Strikes Back'' (co-written with Kenny Finkle and winner of the Fringe's Outstanding Solo Show award in 2005), and Gioia De Cari's ''Truth Values'' (the Fringe's Outstanding Solo Show in 2009). 
 The three-hour class meets once a week for a month, helping students mine material for their infant shows; an advanced class concentrates on polishing and performing. ''Your perfect solo show already exists in you,'' he told the students. ''It's not about coming up with something. It's about listening to what wants to come out.'' 
 After sharing their goals, fears (''that it will be boring'' ranked high) and one-page life stories (a homework assignment), the group came alive. Nora Brown, a performer and choreographer, planned to write about discovering her father's identity. Kyra Anderson, commuting four hours from Northampton, Mass., envisioned a piece about her relationship with her 9-year-old son, who has Asperger's syndrome. Years ago Ms. Anderson went to acting school, moved to New York City, and ''never did anything.'' Now she's hoping to resurrect those old dreams.
 Some students take the class once and venture out; some return regularly for tune-ups. Robin Gelfenbien, whose 2008 show, ''My Salvation Has a First Name,'' chronicles her tenure driving the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, worked with Mr. Hoverman for a year, both in class and privately. Ms. Gelfenbien said she knew she had a promising subject, ''I just didn't know how to make it happen.'' 
 Mr. Hoverman said he thought ''people get overwhelmed because they don't have someone to be that supportive, believing mirror for them.'' That becomes his function, he said, adding, ''I'm the audience until the audience gets there.''
 While Mr. Hoverman, a playwright, comes out of a conventional theater tradition, many solo-show teachers in the city are born of improv comedy, a reflection of the short distance between stand-up and storytelling. 
 ''I think the improv community has had a lot to do with the growth of the solo show community,'' said Jen Nails, who has been teaching solo performance at the Peoples Improv Theater in Chelsea since it opened in 2002. 
 A few blocks south, Margot Leitman, a stand-up comedian cum solo artist, has been teaching at the Upright Citizens Brigade since 2007. Her classes concentrate on creating comic stories from life. In one recent session Ben Lillie, a physics Ph.D., nervously explained how quantum theory always intrudes on the mundane tasks of his day. Could his show be about that? ''Like, I want my mind to stop?'' Ms. Leitman asked. Mr. Lillie agreed. 
 Behind him a whiteboard listed places to check out -- some (like the Moth and Joe's Pub) for watching master soloists at work, and others (like the Bowery Poetry Club or Closet Cases at the Peoples Improv) where a rookie might grab a few minutes of stage time. 
 For many hopefuls the next step is the city's growing theater festival circuit (including the Fringe, SoloNova and the Midtown International Theater festivals). Emerging Artists Theater, with its One Woman Standing festival, offers performers a chance to test-drive new pieces (some as short as five minutes) and participate in an audience talk-back afterward. Stacy Mayer, a company member responsible for selecting submissions, explained that the festival was intended to be part of a performer's process. ''You can't create a solo show in a box,'' she said. ''You need to get up and do it.'' Due to demand, a festival for male performers, One Man Talking, was added three years ago. 
 Cheryl King, curator of Sola Voce at the Estrogenius Festival (a woman's arts festival produced by Manhattan Theater Source) and something of a matriarch of the Off Off Broadway solo scene, has started three festivals: Left Out (for gay performers), Women at Work and, most recently, Beyond the Pale (for erotic pieces). Stage Left Studio, her tidy, 35-seat black-box theater on West 37th Street, hosts a solo show nearly every night -- a roster that recently included Frank Blocker's Drama Desk-nominated Dixie noir ''Southern Gothic Novel.'' 
 Ms. King opened Stage Left in 2006 specifically to help solo performers. ''When you're self-producing, the places you can afford to rent are dumps,'' she said. ''They're just awful. I used to walk into places and ask, 'Do you have a mop?' '' 
 The actor Michael Aronov knows the difference budget can make. After performing ''Manigma'' (a solo piece that celebrates different facets of his personality) at the 78th Street Theater Lab in 2005, producers approached him about an Off Broadway staging this winter, at the Clurman. Overjoyed, Mr. Aronov had a hand in every aspect of the new production, from posters to e-mail invitations. ''It's easier to be a soldier and not the entire war,'' he said, resetting props after one of his final rehearsals. ''But this is so much more fulfilling.'' 
 The prominent monologist Mike Daisey explained why. Mr. Daisy, author of a show titled ''Why Solo Performance Matters,'' contends solo performers are the last vanguard of independent artists in a corporatized theatrical landscape. And this, more than the economy or any other factor, has propelled the rise of solo performances. ''It's becoming more difficult to get any work produced,'' Mr. Daisey said. ''At the end of the day, many people realize that they have only themselves to count on. It's a form where the whole widget can be controlled.''
 Mr. Aronov, attempting precisely that kind of control, and working without a coach or workshop, discovered what no class could teach him. Despite an acclaimed performance and strong ticket sales, ''Manigma'' closed four weeks early when promised investor funds never arrived. ''The only smile on my face these days is when I'm up there,'' Mr. Aronov said, heading into what was suddenly his closing week.
 Small consolation, but the ordeal has the makings of a great solo show. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 7, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a class that specializes in solo performances misspelled, at one point, the surname of a prominent monologist. He is Mike Daisey, not Daisy. The article also mischaracterized ''Why Solo Performance Matters,'' which Mr. Daisey wrote. It is a talk that he has given at performing arts festivals; it is not the name of a show.

HEADLINE: 6 Months, $90,000 and (Maybe) a Great Idea

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE and CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: MENLO PARK, Calif. 

 BODY:
 THE print hanging behind the receptionist's desk at Foundation Capital screams, ''Our greatest thrill is to loan you money'' -- in chunky, capitalized red letters. That's encouraging news for Michael Bauer, because he wants money and has put himself in a prime position to get it. 
 Mr. Bauer has set up shop on the second floor of Foundation Capital's offices here to pursue his dream of creating an energy company from scratch. He pays no rent to operate out of the building, which is designed to evoke a Mediterranean villa. And he's free to enjoy all the trappings of this venture capital firm, including its ample parking, woodsy surroundings and outdoor patio. 
 Mr. Bauer has won these cozy environs through a new role as an ''entrepreneur in residence.'' This coveted position, called an E.I.R. in Silicon Valley shorthand, is emblematic of the valley's economy of ideas. Most E.I.R.'s receive a monthly stipend of up to $15,000 to sit and think for about six months. In return, the venture capital firm usually gets the first shot at financing the idea that emerges from this meditation. 
 ''The E.I.R. takes out some of the risk because they are known quantities,'' said Adam Grosser, a partner at Foundation Capital. ''They have a track record of success and a proven ability to disrupt a market with their ideas.''
 Venture capital firms have been struggling to find a company that will make them not just rich, but fabulously rich. They dream about investing in the next Intel, Apple, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo or Google. But after Google appeared in 1998, the hunt to find the next superprofitable household name stalled. The likes of Facebook and Twitter have garnered plenty of attention but have yet to strike on a business model capable of sending an I.P.O. into the stratosphere. Ten-year returns for the venture capital industry have sunk to 8.4 percent, annualized, in the decade ended last Sept. 30, from 40.2 percent in the 10 years ended Sept. 30, 2008, a number inflated by the spectacular success of Google and other dot-com companies at the beginning of that period. 
 The entrepreneur-in-residence model has gained prominence as a calculated way for a venture capital firm to nurture a successful company into being and to increase the odds of solid returns. The firms often tap someone who has successfully started and sold a start-up, hoping that lightning will strike twice. 
 Mr. Bauer, for instance, has experience in fields ranging from high-speed Internet video to clean technologies.
 ''One part of the venture capital business is to write humongous checks to people for ideas,'' he says. ''Before you write that check, you want to be comfortable with the people and be sure the money will be well spent.''
 The villa, the executive assistant and the clubby lunches are not exactly the stuff of Silicon Valley legend, which abounds with tales of wild success sprouting from a garage or a dorm room where a pair of geeky unknowns toiled away, unable to keep their unconventional ideas in check. Cases in point are William Hewlett and David Packard, Steven P. Jobs and Steve Wozniak, and Sergey Brin and Larry Page. 
 Silicon Valley has had a knack for finding at least one of these remarkable pairings just about every decade. They're the creators of new industries -- chips, PCs, servers, Web sites and ad-fueled search systems -- on which others build. But lately, companies started by E.I.R.'s have done yeoman's work for the venture capitalists. 
 The investment firm New Enterprise Associates, for example, hit it big last year when the storage giant EMC bought Data Domain for $2.3 billion, the largest acquisition in 2009 of a venture-backed technology company. (The average deal that year was just $144 million.)
 The Data Domain story grew out of a chance encounter. Kai Li, who would be a co-founder of the company, was on sabbatical from his job as a computer science professor. He had been thinking about some ideas for a start-up when he ran into an old friend from New Enterprise. A couple of chats later, he was an E.I.R. 
 Similarly, the biggest public offering of a venture-backed technology company in 2007 was that of MetroPCS, which raised $1.2 billion. It was started by Roger Linquist when he was an E.I.R. at the venture capital firm Accel. 
 A host of other flashy companies have recently emerged from the E.I.R. ether. Zimbra, an e-mail software start-up, was sold for $350 million to Yahoo in 2007. (In a very different economic climate this year, it was sold again to VMware for a reported $100 million.) Then there's Cloudera, one of the most-watched start-ups in Silicon Valley. It seeks to bottle the analytical smarts on which Google and Yahoo rely to understand their users' behavior and sell the product to large corporations dealing with torrents of data. Cloudera came into being at Accel, where a pair of E.I.R.'s worked after having left Yahoo and Facebook.
 Venture capital firms are closely held, so there is no data on the number of companies that the E.I.R. process has created -- or on how many of them have succeeded. But top firms say a new company is formed about 50 percent of the time. The rest of the E.I.R.'s will either take on a job at an existing company in the venture capital firm's stable or go their own way. 
 It can be awkward if a venture capital firm, which knows the entrepreneur best, turns down an idea that arrives from the six months of meditation. 
 ''Does it put a negative stigma on a company? I think the answer is definitely,'' says Jeff Fagnan, a partner at Atlas Venture. 
 THE idea of the E.I.R. was developed in the early 1980s to maintain ties to talented people who were between jobs and to add a level of refinement to the start-up process. 
 ''This is sort of the formalization of innovation and new firm building,'' says Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of SeaMicro, a start-up that grew out of his time as an E.I.R. at Crosslink Capital. ''The venture capital industry has matured and so, too, has venture creation.''
 Leading venture capital firms today may have two or three E.I.R.'s on the payroll at any one time. An E.I.R. typically has an office, an assistant and what people in Silicon Valley almost always refer to as a ''nominal fee'' of $10,000 to $15,000 a month. It's enough to tide over the elite business people whom investors are looking for, so that they aren't worried about lacking a day job for six months. 
 ''In the days of the 9-to-5 job, you had some personal time to be creative and think of new ideas,'' says Kevin Epstein, a former E.I.R. at Mohr Davidow Ventures who now works at CloudShare, an online software start-up. ''I don't see many of those jobs anymore.'' 
 In exchange for the office and the stipend, the E.I.R. provides a few basic services. 
 He or she becomes part of the audience for start-up road shows, sitting in on the daily presentations that other companies pitch to the venture capital firm and advising the investors about the ideas' merits. In addition, the E.I.R. agrees -- via contract or, more often, tacitly -- to give the venture capital firm the first shot to invest in an idea. 
 ''It is as ruthless and profit-oriented at the end of the day as anything else a V.C. does,'' said Adam Gross, a former E.I.R. at Redpoint Ventures. 
 This arrangement provides E.I.R.'s with a few major advantages over other entrepreneurs. The masses have to go to great lengths just to get in the door of a venture capitalist's office, while E.I.R.'s work there daily. They can sit in on Monday-morning partner meetings and pitches,and they can consult with the partners in the lunch line. 
 And, when E.I.R.'s are ready to test an idea, they can tap the vast network of contacts that the venture capital firm has built over time. This could include persuading a large company to provide feedback on a product or polling a host of companies about their technology problems. 
 ''If you're doing surveys or trying to find out where the opportunities are, it provides you with some legitimacy to say you're an E.I.R. at a well-known shop,'' Mr. Feldman says. ''You piggyback on a very rich network and sort of become part of the family.''
 In addition, the process adds a touch of human companionship and vibrancy to an otherwise lonely, sedentary endeavor. 
 When Mr. Gross left his position as an executive at the software provider Salesforce.com, he wanted to work at a start-up but thought he needed ''an intellectual palate cleanser to get a new perspective.'' 
 At Redpoint, he saw a bunch of start-ups come in to pitch their ideas. He kept hearing about business software that incorporates elements of the consumer Web, and came up with his own idea for a software start-up.
 ''It's not just advice,'' he said. ''It's exposure to ideas and models and approaches and struggles that you wouldn't get otherwise.'' 
 Mr. Gross left Redpoint before finishing his version of the next big thing; he received an offer from a partner at a rival firm, Sequoia Capital, to run sales and marketing at Dropbox, an online storage start-up in Sequoia's portfolio. 
 ''I think we both would have preferred to continue working together, but they were very supportive,'' he says of Redpoint's partners. 
 Mr. Gross's tale highlights the rather forgiving expectations that surround the E.I.R. gig. Still, venture capital firms take their trade in E.I.R.'s very seriously. These firms, after all, have no intellectual property of their own. They deal in relationships, and knowing smart, creative people gives one firm an edge over another. 
 When, for example, a large acquisition like Oracle's purchase of Sun Microsystems is announced, the venture capitalists might hit their phones, calling 10 or so brainy people at Sun to offer them a cushy way out of dealing with an acquisition. 
 Many people find their way into an E.I.R. role through a fortuitous lunch or a meeting in the hallway of another company. The process requires a certain level of hand-holding, as the prospective investors guide the entrepreneur. 
 But that hasn't stopped people from trying to copy and, one might say, commoditize the E.I.R. idea.
 Austin Ventures has three entrepreneurs in residence, who are starting companies, and 13 C.E.O.'s-in-residence, who help the firm find late-stage companies to invest in and then run the businesses. Austin hires people it has worked with previously as well as people it doesn't know. 
 ''We kind of had an epiphany,'' says Phil Siegel, an Austin partner. ''The competition and the need for talented people is in some ways a lot harder than the competition for deals.'' Today, 40 percent of the firm's deals come from one of these programs.
 BUSINESS schools like Harvard and Wharton have E.I.R. programs, as do big companies like Hewlett-Packard and Adobe. The Department of Energy started one as well, to try to transform ideas formed at national laboratories into seedlings for companies. 
 But people trying to replicate the process are not always as successful as those in Silicon Valley. 
 Mr. Bauer worked on the Department of Energy's E.I.R. project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. ''It was fascinating but also very disappointing,'' he said. ''I looked at 1,500 invention disclosures and walked away from 1,500 ideas.'' 
 His office at Foundation Capital is full of oscilloscopes and other gadgets, which makes it an oddity in the E.I.R. world, where most people just sit in front of their computers. He has built a replica of a city block on a desk to test his top-secret energy ideas. Foundation Capital has bought into his plans, and Mr. Bauer and his team are now leaving the nest and getting their own offices.
 While the expectations are high for his ideas, Mr. Bauer maintains that the E.I.R. programs work precisely because failure is allowed in Silicon Valley. 
 ''In other parts of the world, there is a big stigma on your resume if you try and fail,'' he said. ''That doesn't happen here. Instead, people like the E.I.R.'s are ready to keep on taking swings.''

HEADLINE: Muslims Won't Play Together

BYLINE: By EFRAIM KARSH. 
Efraim Karsh, the head of Middle East and Mediterranean studies at King's College London, is the author of ''Islamic Imperialism: A History'' and the forthcoming ''Palestine Betrayed.''

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
 WE may scoff at the idea that the Olympic Games have anything to do with the ''endeavor to place sport at the service of humanity and thereby to promote peace,'' as the Olympic charter enshrines as its ideal. But at least nations across the world were able to put aside differences for two weeks of friendly competition in Vancouver. 
 A mundane achievement, perhaps, but it's one that's beyond the grasp of the Islamic world. The Islamic Solidarity Games, the Olympics of the Muslim world, which were to be held in Iran in April, have been called off by the Arab states because Tehran inscribed ''Persian Gulf'' on the tournament's official logo and medals. 
 It's a small but telling controversy. It puts the lie to the idea of the Islamic world as a bloc united by religious values that are hostile to the West. It also gives clues as to how the United States and its allies should handle two of their most urgent foreign policy matters: the Iranian nuclear program and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
 This is not the first time that Arabs have challenged the internationally accepted name of the waterway that separates Persia (or Iran, as it has been called since 1935) from the Arabian Peninsula. Pan-Arabist thought -- which dominated Arab political life for most of the 20th century -- insisted on the creation of a unified vast empire ''from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arab Gulf,'' provoking sharp confrontations with Iran since the late 1960s.
 The Islamic regime in Tehran, which came to power in 1979 dismissing nationalism as an imperialist plot aimed at weakening the worldwide Muslim community (or umma), initially displayed less interest in the gulf's Persian identity than in the spread of its Islamist message. ''The Iranian revolution is not exclusively that of Iran, because Islam does not belong to any particular people,'' insisted Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. ''The struggle will continue until the calls 'there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah' are echoed all over the world.''
 Yet like Stalin, who responded to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 by urging his people to fight for the motherland rather than for the Communist ideals with which they had been indoctrinated, Khomeini reverted to nationalist rhetoric to rally his subjects after the Iraqi invasion of 1980. He also used the war to justify a string of military and diplomatic actions against the smaller Arab states like Qatar and Kuwait aimed at asserting Iran's supremacy in the gulf.
 In this history of a single body of water, one sees a perfect example of the so-called Islamic Paradox that dates from the seventh century. For although the Prophet Muhammad took great pains to underscore the equality of all believers regardless of ethnicity, categorically forbidding any fighting among the believers, his precepts have been constantly and blatantly violated.
 It took a mere 24 years after the Prophet's death for the head of the universal Islamic community, the caliph Uthman, to be murdered by political rivals. This opened the floodgates to incessant infighting within the House of Islam, which has never ceased. Likewise, there has been no overarching Islamic solidarity transcending the multitude of parochial loyalties -- to one's clan, tribe, village, family or nation. Thus, for example, not only do Arabs consider themselves superior to all other Muslims, but inhabitants of Hijaz, the northwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula and Islam's birthplace, regard themselves the only true Arabs, and tend to be highly disparaging of all other Arabic-speaking communities. 
 Nor, for that matter, has the House of Islam ever formed a unified front vis-a-vis the House of War (as Muslims call the rest of the world). Even during the Crusades, the supposed height of the ''clash of civilizations,'' Christian and Muslim rulers freely collaborated across the religious divide, often finding themselves aligned with members of the rival religion against their co-religionists. While the legendary Saladin himself was busy eradicating the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, for example, he was closely aligned with the Byzantine Empire, the foremost representative of Christendom's claim to universalism.
 This pattern of pragmatic cooperation reached its peak during the 19th century, when the Ottoman Empire relied on Western economic and military support to survive. (The Charge of the Light Brigade of 1854 was, at its heart, part of a French-British effort to keep the Ottomans from falling under Russian hegemony.) It has also become a central feature of 20th- and 21st-century Middle Eastern politics. 
 Muslim and Arab rulers have always, in their intrigues, sought the support and protection of the ''infidel'' powers they so vilify. President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, the champion of pan-Arabism who had built his reputation on standing up to ''Western imperialism,'' imported more than 10,000 Soviet troops into Egypt when his ''War of Attrition'' against Israel in the late 1960s went sour. 
 Similarly, Ayatollah Khomeini bought weapons from even the ''Great Satan,'' the United States. Saddam Hussein used Western support to survive his war against Iran in the 1980s. And Osama bin Laden and the rest of the Afghan mujahedeen accepted weapons and money from the United States, with the Islamic state of Pakistan as the middleman, in their struggle against the Soviet occupation. 
 Yet, since it is far easier to unite people through a common hatred than through a shared loyalty, Islamic solidarity has been repeatedly invoked as an instrument for achieving the self-interested ends of those who proclaimed it. Little wonder the covenant of Hamas insists, ''When our enemies usurp some Islamic lands, jihad becomes a duty binding on all Muslims.''
 So, if the Muslim bloc is just as fractious as any other group of seemingly aligned nations, what does it mean for United States policy in the Islamic world?
 For one, it should give us more impetus to take a harder line with Iran. Just as the Muslim governments couldn't muster the minimum sense of commonality for holding an all-Islamic sports tournament, so they would be unlikely to rush to Iran's aid in the event of sanctions, or even a military strike. 
 Beyond the customary lip service about Western imperialism and ''Crusaderism,'' most other Muslim countries would be quietly relieved to see the extremist regime checked. It's worth noting that the two dominant Arab states, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, have been at the forefront of recent international efforts to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions.
 As for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the idea that bringing peace between the two parties will bring about a flowering of cooperation in the region and take away one of Al Qaeda's primary gripes against the West totally misreads history and present-day politics. Muslim states threaten Israel's existence not so much out of concern for the Palestinians, but rather as part of a holy war to prevent the loss of a part of the House of Islam. 
 In these circumstances, one can only welcome the latest changes in the Obama administration's Middle Eastern policy, which combine a tougher stance on Iran's nuclear subterfuge with a less imperious approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's two-track plan -- discussion with Tehran while at the same time lining up meaningful sanctions -- is fine as far as it goes. But a military strike must remain a serious option: there is no peaceful way to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, stemming as they do from its imperialist brand of national-Islamism. 
 Likewise, there is no way for the Obama administration to resolve the 100-year war between Arabs and Jews unless all sides are convinced that peace is in each of their best interests. Any agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is far less important than a regional agreement in which every Islamic nation can make peace with the idea of Jewish statehood in the House of Islam. 
 And that, depressingly, is going to be a lot harder to pull off than even the Islamic Solidarity Games.

HEADLINE: At Binghamton, Concerns That Sports Are Still the Focus

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

DATELINE: VESTAL, N.Y. 

 BODY:
In the weeks since an audit faulted Binghamton University's leadership for allowing its men's basketball program to spin out of control, the university has experienced a crisis of confidence. Interviews with students, administrators and faculty members revealed just how corrosive the trade-offs were in Binghamton's pursuit of athletic glory. 
 The audit, commissioned by the State University of New York board, described a litany of transgressions, including lowered admission standards and changed grades. It has roiled the tightknit university, the academic jewel of the 64-college SUNY system. 
 ''The primary loser was the academic program in regard to the standards Binghamton has held very high over the years,'' said Thomas O'Connor, a distinguished professor of Spanish. ''For most people on this campus, the academic professionals, it was very, very disappointing to see. The standards we all adhere to were compromised.'' 
 Even though the university president, Lois B. DeFleur, has announced she will retire in July; the athletic director, Joel Thirer, has resigned; and the men's basketball coach, Kevin Broadus, has been placed on paid administrative leave, faculty members and administrators are concerned that those who carried out the orders in building a big-time basketball program remain. They worry that when the SUNY chancellor, Nancy L. Zimpher, makes recommendations to the board March 23, she will focus on Binghamton's athletic problems, not its academic troubles. 
 Zimpher declined to comment. The spokesman David Henahan said SUNY would ''take the necessary steps to restore oversight, accountability and unquestioned academic integrity at Binghamton University.''
 The apprehension is most acute in the department of human development, where at least 10 of the 16 Binghamton men's basketball players are studying, according to the report released Feb. 11. It was in human development, the report said, that players who had transferred received academic credit for courses like Theories of Softball and Bowling I, and were given preferential treatment to stay eligible. 
 Now, some current and former students are concerned that their education has been devalued. 
 ''This isn't the legacy we signed up for when we sent in our acceptance letters,'' said an editorial in the student newspaper, Pipe Dream.
 Kevin N. Wright, a human development professor in his 30th year at Binghamton, said the SUNY audit showed that his department had been manipulated by university officials, in part to make room for academically challenged basketball players. 
 ''Are we going to let the president be the fall person, and all the existing administrators who carried out her orders stay there with no sanctions?'' Wright said. ''And then we'll have business as usual with the same people in charge. 
 ''What the report accused Binghamton University of was, rather than taking corrective action, trying to cover their tracks. Unless something happens, that behavior will repeat itself.'' 
 Perhaps no action speaks more to the cronyism, bullying and administrative efforts to control the department than the placement of Donna Di Stefano as the academic adviser in the College of Community and Public Affairs, which includes human development. 
 Di Stefano's promotion raised eyebrows because she was the secretary to Provost Mary Ann Swain and had no experience in academic advisement, a SUNY requirement. The job was also not advertised publicly. Formal complaints to the Binghamton chapter of United University Professions about Di Stefano's placement went without action. The Binghamton spokeswoman Gail Glover described Di Stefano as well qualified. 
 ''It felt like we were being spied on,'' said Nicole Murphy, who received the human development department's academic excellence award upon her graduation in 2008. As an officer of the Human Development Association, Murphy kept a folder of student complaints about Di Stefano, whom she called incompetent. 
 Di Stefano, who was not named in the report, had a major role in aiding Binghamton's sudden rise to national power in basketball. (Wright, smiling, said Di Stefano's vanity license plate includes the word Bearcat, the university teams' nickname.) Under her watch as academic adviser, the report stated, one player received 16 transfer credits for physical education courses; another received 12 credits. They should have been limited to two physical education credits, the report said.
 ''That never would have happened when I was chair, and it never would have happened if Jill Seymour was academic adviser,'' said Sue Crowley, a former chairwoman of the human development department, referring to Di Stefano's predecessor. ''We never did that, and Jill would never would have done that or asked to do such a thing.''
 Seymour, who was removed from the position without explanation, declined to comment. When reached by telephone, Di Stefano said, ''I'm not interested in speaking with you.'' 
 Sally Dear, an adjunct lecturer who first cast light on the problems with basketball players in the department, told The New York Times last year that she had been pressured by athletic department officials to change her grading policy. She said she was frustrated that the people who had complied with administrators in the basketball scandal still had jobs. 
 ''We are all bound by the ethics of our profession,'' said Dear, who is leaving Binghamton after this semester for what the university said were economic reasons. ''If I have all this fallout and all this going on because I told the truth, what about the people who did unethical things? What happens to them? It would be a sad state of affairs if they go free and their actions go on unfettered. No one seems to be paying attention to the academic part of it.''
 The 99-page audit stated that last spring, as Binghamton reached the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament for the first time, accommodations were made to protect the eligibility of five players. 
 Those players dropped classes in favor of independent-study courses. Wright said that one player who had been enrolled in his class did not show up for the first four weeks, then entered an independent study after the add-drop deadline. That player, according to the report, received at least a B. 
 ''Were standards met?'' Wright said. ''Show me the proof he did a semester's worth of work and produced a paper that reflected that. Other students have to write an application for an independent study. If these students don't have an academic record, how can they even do independent studies?'' 
 Leo Wilton, the chairman of the human development department, was particularly accommodating to basketball players, according to the report. It said that Wilton sent an e-mail message to Broadus encouraging players to take a mandatory class with him, though he rarely teaches it. Last summer, Wilton also taught five players in a one-week course and conducted an independent study in which four new players were his only students. 
 An associate professor, Sharon Holmes, also accommodated three basketball players in a summer 2009 course whose remaining spots were supposed to be reserved for graduate students. Holmes said in the report that she had asked another professor to quickly grade a player's late work so he could play. She said that it was ''asking a lot'' but that the request had been made by ''powers that be,'' referring to Dean Patricia Ingraham.
 Wright said that five students in his Models of Social Advocacy class had said they were considering changing majors after the human development department's problems were exposed. 
 Murphy and another 2008 graduate, Jenna Grisar, said they loved the department for the first three years. Then human development moved downtown for their senior year, and they said they had difficulties in dealing with Ingraham and Swain, the university's chief academic officer. 
 ''I can't stress enough how amazing this program used to be,'' Grisar said. ''It's a shame that it's unrecognizable. The atmosphere isn't just different, it's scary and not healthy. It's a place where students aren't encouraged to ask questions or think critically about what's going on. That's what education is supposed to be all about.'' 
 She added she used to speak to prospective students about the department. But now, Grisar said, she ''couldn't in good conscience recommend someone go there now.'' 
 When the department moved to a new building downtown in the fall of 2007, students' concerns included parking and safety. Grisar and Murphy said that requests for simple things like vending machines and bulletin boards were rebuffed. While administrators and professors were going to great lengths to accommodate basketball players, Grisar and Murphy said, they were ignoring the needs of regular students. 
 The atmosphere became so toxic, Grisar said, that professors felt as if ''they had to look over their shoulder when they sneezed.'' 
 Murphy said: ''They systematically went through and weeded out anyone who wasn't willing to blindly follow them. The professors that supported the students were the ones who lost their positions, and the people they could manipulate wound up in charge.'' 
 Grisar added, ''It's really ironic, and at some point you have to laugh, that these are the people teaching us about morals.''
 At a recent human development department faculty meeting, Wright said, Wilton, the department chairman, complained that SUNY had delivered an audit filled with inaccuracies. Wilton did not return a call seeking comment. Neither did Swain or Ingraham. 
 ''The whole report is that the university does damage control rather than addressing the issues, and their response is to do more damage control,'' Wright said. 
 After the audit was released, Carl Hayden, the SUNY chairman said, ''I would fall off my chair if Nancy Zimpher's recommendations didn't apply the lessons we're living through.'' 
 To some on campus, those words are hollow. 
 ''I don't have faith,'' Wright said, ''that Binghamton can straighten itself out.''

HEADLINE: The Buried Treasure In Your TV Dial

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER

 BODY:
HERE'S a list of national domestic priorities, in no particular order: Stimulate the economy, improve health care, offer fast Internet connections to all of our schools, foster development of advanced technology. Oh, and let's not forget, we'd better do something about the budget deficit. 
 Now, suppose that there were a way to deal effectively with all of those things at once, without hurting anyone. And suppose that it would make everyone's smartphone work better, too. (I'll explain that benefit shortly.) 
 I know that this sounds like the second coming of voodoo economics, but bear with me. This proposal involves no magical thinking, just good common sense: By simply reallocating the way we use the radio spectrum now devoted to over-the-air television broadcasting, we can create a bonanza for the government, stimulate the economy and advance all of the other goals listed above. Really.
 The reason for this golden opportunity may be in your purse or pocket: that smartphone to which you could well be addicted. The iPhone, the BlackBerry and competing devices are already amazing technologies. But precisely because of the nifty features they offer, like the ability to text photos, stream video and provide GPS directions, the radio spectrum is looking as crowded as Times Square on New Year's Eve. Demand for spectrum is growing rapidly -- a trend that will surely continue. 
 The problem is that the usable radio spectrum is limited and used inefficiently. Think of it as a 100-lane highway with various lanes set aside for particular uses, including AM and FM radio, TV and wireless computer technology. The government -- specifically, the Federal Communications Commission -- is in charge of deciding which devices use which lanes. 
 Because we can't create additional spectrum, we must make better use of the existing space. And the target that looks most promising in this regard is the spectrum used for over-the-air television broadcasts.
 These frequencies are very attractive on technological grounds. People in the industry refer to them as ''beachfront property'' because these low-frequency radio waves have desirable properties: they travel long distances and permeate walls. We have already allocated parts of this spectrum for mobile wireless, and the F.C.C. recently auctioned other parts for $19 billion. That has left 49 channels for over-the-air television.
 Why is the current use of this spectrum so inefficient? First, because of the need to prevent interference among stations, only 17 percent of it is actually allocated by the F.C.C. for full-power television stations. (The so-called white space among stations is used for some limited short-range applications like wireless microphones.) 
 Second, over-the-air broadcasts are becoming a nearly obsolete technology. Already, 91 percent of American households get their television via cable or satellite. So we are using all of this beachfront property to serve a small and shrinking segment of the population. 
 Suppose we put this spectrum up for sale. (The local stations do not ''own'' this spectrum. They have licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission.) Although the details of how to conduct this auction are important, they don't make compelling reading on a Sunday morning. Interested readers should examine a detailed proposal made to the F.C.C. by Thomas W. Hazlett, a professor at the George Mason University School of Law who was formerly the F.C.C.'s chief economist.
 Professor Hazlett estimates that selling off this spectrum could raise at least $100 billion for the government and, more important, create roughly $1 trillion worth of value to users of the resulting services. Those services would include ultrahigh-speed wireless Internet access (including access for schools, of course) much improved cellphone coverage and fewer ugly cell towers. And they would include other new things we can't imagine any more than we could have imagined an iPhone just 10 years ago.
 But some compelling technology that could use these frequencies already exists, like wireless health monitoring -- to check diabetics' blood sugar regularly, for example -- and remote robotic surgery that can give a patient in Idaho a treatment like that available in New York or Chicago. 
 Who would oppose this plan? Local broadcasters are likely to contend that they are providing a vital community service in return for free use of the spectrum that was put in their hands decades ago. Whether the local news or other programs are vital services is up for debate, but their value isn't the issue, because they can be made available via cable, satellite and other technologies, including improved broadband.
 Say there are 10 million households that still get their television over the air, including those that can't afford cable or satellite and some that generally just don't care for what's on TV. (Yes, there are people who don't like ''American Idol.'') But about 99 percent of these households have cable running near their homes, and virtually all the others, in rural areas, could be reached by satellite services. The F.C.C. could require cable and satellite providers to offer a low-cost service that carries only local channels, and to give vouchers for connecting to that service to any households that haven't subscribed to cable or satellite for, say, two years. 
 Professor Hazlett estimates that $300 per household should do it: that amounts to $3 billion at most. Compared with the gains from selling off the spectrum, it's a drop in the bucket. Or, as an interim step, we could reduce the number of channels available in a community from 49 to, say, 5.
 I KNOW that this proposal sounds too good to be true, but I think the opportunity is real. And unlike some gimmicks from state and local governments, like selling off proceeds from the state lottery to a private company, this doesn't solve current problems simply by borrowing from future generations. Instead, by allowing scarce resources to be devoted to more productive uses, we can create real value for the economy. 
 Economists are fond of saying that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Here we have an idea that is even better than a free lunch: being paid to eat lunch. More paid-lunch ideas will be coming in future columns.

HEADLINE: The Visible Man

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS DAWIDOFF

 BODY:
SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK, a tall, broad-shouldered African-American Methodist preacher named James Fields drives his black pickup truck toward the quiet Alabama city of Cullman. An hour into the red-dirt hills above Birmingham, Cullman is the seat of a farming county where the strongest legal drink you can buy at the pool hall is Pepsi; the kegs at the annual Oktoberfest hold only root beer. ''Welcome to Mayberry!'' strangers are greeted. And then, ''We all do have bathrooms and wear shoes!'' With its steeples, grain elevators, striped barber poles, fireflies and wisteria, Cullman has the faraway feel of a small Southern town untroubled by time. ''Sweet Cullman!'' Fields sometimes says when he's on his way in. ''It's home!'' 
 For Fields, the trip to Cullman takes him 17 miles north. He lives in Colony, a mountainous backwoods hamlet that in Cullman is usually called the Colony. Among the 81,000 people in Cullman County, there are only 401 African-American voters, and all reside, as far as most people in Cullman know, in the small houses and rusting trailers scattered through Colony's hollows. Fields serves on several boards in Cullman, with white men who, in the midst of conversations with him, may refer to Colony citizens as ''those people down there.'' A composed, practical person, Fields responds without expression. He's similarly inscrutable when he hears claims that what is known in Cullman as ''the sign'' never existed. Even though Fields says, ''It was there and folks know it,'' he doesn't push back: ''You just let it go. Sometimes things like that need to stay buried. That was in the past. Let us move forward.'' 
 Versions of Cullman's old sundown sign hung beside county roads well into the 1970s, and all of them repeated the message that the travel writer Carl Carmer saw when he visited Cullman in the late 1920s: ''Nigger Don't Let the Sun Go Down on You in This Town.'' The sign was notorious all over Alabama, and coupled with Cullman's powerful Ku Klux Klan, it created a racial deterrent so effective that even today, Cullman's are exits off the Interstate that most African-Americans avoid. A district judge at the Cullman courthouse named Kim Chaney told me, ''I do have black people who are very reluctant to come to court here because of the reputation we've had for so many years.'' As for younger white people who grow up in Cullman, they sometimes feel forced to justify themselves when they go elsewhere because, as Rozalyn Love, a medical student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham explains, ''Cullman is known, especially among Birmingham folks, as the racist white bigot county.'' In Alabama, this is, of course, saying something.
 But what? Sixty years ago, in his classic book ''Southern Politics in State and Nation,'' V. O. Key wrote, ''The politics of the South revolves around the position of the Negro.'' In 1964, legend has it, the Democratic president Lyndon Johnson turned to an aide after signing the Civil Rights Act and predicted doom for his party: ''We have lost the South for a generation.'' Two generations later, the enduring, invisible presence of Cullman's old sundown sign can seem to reflect racism's tenacious hold on the Deep South. During the 2008 presidential election, exit polling revealed that an overwhelming 88 percent of Alabama's voting whites chose John McCain, a total far exceeding what the incumbent George W. Bush received four years earlier against John Kerry, generally thought to be a weaker and more liberal candidate than Barack Obama. (The same pattern held true in Mississippi and Louisiana.) About these discrepancies David Bositis, the senior political analyst at the nonpartisan Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, says, ''I attribute all of it to racial bias.'' 
 One of the few Obama supporters in Cullman County was Fields, who drove two days to the new president's inauguration and watched, ''in a state of aweness,'' Fields says, as Obama put his hand to the Bible. Not many months before, Fields entered politics himself. In the South, black politicians almost always represent districts with a substantial black majority. Yet when the state legislative seat for the western side of Cullman County was unexpectedly vacated one year into the four-year term, Fields went ahead and announced his candidacy for the January 2008 special election, making him the first ever African-American to run in Cullman County. Alabama's lieutenant governor, Jim Folsom Jr., a Democratic former governor who grew up in Cullman and still lives there, says that Democratic power brokers across the state were aghast: ''They thought it was totally impossible that James Fields could get elected in this county.'' Several met with Fields, urging him to withdraw. 
 Fields is a descendant of slaves who worked on plantations in Georgia and Mississippi before relocating to Colony after the Civil War. During his career at Alabama's state-employment service, Fields was a tireless advocate for the down-on-their-luck, finding so many white people in Cullman jobs that generations of working families -- and their employers -- came to know and admire him. He was similarly generous with his evenings and weekends, coaching children's sports and giving guest sermons at Cullman churches of many denominations. Now 55 and retired from Alabama's Department of Industrial Relations, Fields has a solemn face with chestnut-hued, vaguely Cherokee features, a black mustache, powder-gray hair and the relaxed, affable bearing that doesn't ever seem ruffled in those moments when someone informs him that he is the first black ever to enter their home -- which happens to him frequently in Cullman. Fields gives the impression of being such a humble, mild-mannered person that people often fail to notice how powerfully emotion runs alongside restraint in him. When he was elected with 59 percent of the vote, he became, in that most telling word, Cullman County's representative.
 THAT CULLMAN SHOULD enthusiastically choose a black Democrat from its midst while emphatically rejecting Obama is only the latest apparent contradiction in this American region that has always seemed to thrive on them. For James Fields's surprising election by an almost entirely white electorate is not unique to Cullman. Across the South there are increasing examples of black politicians forming black-white coalitions to win local elections in white areas. It occurred in the wire-grass country in southeast Alabama, where Locy Baker is completing his fourth term as a state representative. And it took place in Georgia in three different Congressional districts and four legislative districts. Perhaps most tellingly, it happened in Philadelphia, Miss., the small town of 8,000 that became infamous in 1964 after three civil rights workers were murdered there -- crimes that inspired the film ''Mississippi Burning.'' In May, a black former county supervisor and Pentecostal minister named James Young was elected Philadelphia's mayor. Young remembers being a boy in 1964 when his father patrolled the family living room with a rifle. In the immediate aftermath of his mayoral election, he described it as ''an atomic bomb of change.'' 
 Taken together, these victories look more like slender cracks scratched into a solid edifice, but they do mean something, which leaves scholars from Athens to Oxford puzzling over just what -- as well as how to reconcile them with the repudiation of Obama. It may be that for the first time, slowly, grudgingly, in ways still visible only in local glimpses, the racial politics of the South are changing of the South's own free will. 
 Wayne Flynt, a retired Auburn University historian and author of several distinguished books about Alabama and the South, including ''Poor but Proud,'' says that for most of his life it would have been impossible for a white Alabama electorate to think of a black candidate in anything other than abstract terms -- as a black. ''Incongruous and incomprehensible to people is that Southerners generally don't personalize race,'' Flynt says. ''The more abstract race becomes, the more racist it becomes.'' Now, Flynt says, someone like James Fields can make himself known to voters as the individual he is. In a region of the country where running for office is a hands-on, even intimate endeavor, this amounts to a political metamorphosis. ''In my lifetime, the major change is that personalism can trump racism,'' Flynt says.
 Joseph Crespino, an Emory University historian, agrees: ''I see it in the little Mississippi town I'm from. A new generation's come up. You never would have had white folks supporting a black candidate 20 years ago. It's a notable change, a big, interesting change for the long term.'' 
 The perplexing nature of social change is that it often doesn't look like change, especially early on, when the process can appear fitful, resistant to measure, spasmodic, fragmentary and ambiguous. If you talk with an optimist like Artur Davis, the African-American Congressman from Birmingham, he'll tell you he believes that, had Obama made a serious effort to win Alabama, he might have been competitive in the state, as he was in neighboring Georgia, where he won 47 percent of the vote. The Harvard-educated Davis, known as the Alabama Obama, says that today in Alabama elections, ''race is not an insurmountable obstacle'' -- a line of thinking he is currently testing himself by running for governor. If he wins the Democratic primary in June, Davis will become Alabama's first black nominee for a statewide executive office. Take up the prospects of Davis actually reaching the statehouse with an Alabama African-American political pessimist, like the veteran Democratic operative Jerome Gray, and the response is ''pipe dreams, building air castles.'' Gray considers this ''such a fragile moment'' for his party that he is working not for Davis but for the Congressman's white Democratic rival, Ron Sparks, the commissioner of agriculture. Yet Gray says: ''It is a shift. It's still hard. You have to recognize the advances that are made, even if at the time they seem small.''
 Sitting in Atlanta, where he edits Southern Political Report, Tom Baxter looks out across the old land of cotton and sees a dynamic landscape that, like the rest of the country, is ''more complicated than it ever was before.'' Baxter says he believes that one measure of this complexity is ''there's no such thing as a representative Southern town.'' Yet what there may be is a representative Southern politician. To examine James Fields's remarkable path to power and his experience as a black man standing for the interests of a community that once welcomed him only through its back doors is to see the way an African-American candidate used the traditional Southern approach to politics to break down the traditional Southern political narrative. But Fields is also a pioneer, and the nature of the condition is that his hour of triumph runs alongside days of frustration, compromise, indignity and heartbreak. With his own election day looming, more may be coming soon. 
 UNTIL FIELDS WAS 8, his father, Cleophus, worked as a coal miner near Colony. ''I can remember my father driving brand new cars, sometimes two in a year, then giving them away to his brother,'' Fields says. ''Then the mine closed and it was tough and he started drinking moonshine and Kentucky Gentleman.'' Fields has five siblings -- another five died in childbirth -- and they were all scared of Cleophus. ''On weekends,'' Fields says, ''if we made it through Friday, great. Saturday, great. Sunday we knew it was coming. Every weekend. He was gonna come home raising hell and jump on Mother.'' This went on till Fields was 15, when his father ''set it aside for the church.'' Cleophus died of black lung at age 60.
 Fields calls his childhood ''rough and tough.'' His mother, Ophelia, cut chicken parts at a processing plant. In the spring, the children left school as soon as it was time to hire out picking peas, beans and cotton for local farmers. The family lived in an unpainted wooden house. Wind found new cracks in the walls all winter, and Ophelia filled them with wads of newspaper coated in putty she mixed out of flour and starch. The family shared three mattresses made of straw sewn into bedsheets. 
 The only whites Fields ever saw were men who drove down from Cullman to Colony, got drunk on moonshine and then would call a kid like Fields over to their car to ask where they could find a woman. ''As a child,'' he says, ''I never did come into Cullman except one time shopping with my mother at age 12 or 13. It was the experience of a lifetime. First time I heard the word 'nigger' coming from a white kid's mouth. You walked in the store's back door. I couldn't try on anything or touch anything. They measured your feet with a ruler. Clothes they held up to your back, and they sold you ones that were too big.''
 The nearby school in Hanceville was integrated to children from Colony in 1965, but not to Fields. ''They had a testing year when a chosen few went,'' he says. ''I didn't go. They sent the neatest black kids the first year. We didn't even have toothpaste. The rest of us went the following year.'' He was immediately popular. ''I'd guess you'd say he solved a lot of racial issues between blacks and whites,'' says his white schoolmate Tom Swann. ''He was peacemaker for both sides. Most Colony children were scared to death and didn't want to be there.'' Fields was an outstanding athlete until he broke his leg playing football, and he cultivated a suave, elegant appearance. ''James was always a slick-master, he always dressed well,'' says a white friend, Doyle Baker. ''We used to go to the previously worn and overstocked shoe store.'' 
 As a young man, Fields tried the Marines, went to Gadsden State Community College and then on to Jacksonville State University, where he studied law-enforcement sociology and English and met Valencia Ward. They had two children and divorced after four years of marriage. 
 At 24, back home and living in Colony, Fields told me, ''I accepted Christ in my life.'' He says he believes in a literal reading of the Bible. Five years later he married Willie Mae Leeth, a laboratory technician at Tyson Foods. Besides his work for the state, Fields took on weekend jobs, including driving a limousine -- ''You're in my wedding pictures!'' people in Cullman often tell him -- and later became a Christian pastor. Fields says he was never ruffled on his visits to the city when people wouldn't shake his hand and he heard: '' 'Hey nigger, watchu doin' in Cullman? Hey boy.' I still see these people. It never changed me. For them I don't know.''
 One day, in 1998, Fields came home to discover Willie Mae dead of a massive stroke. ''I was broken, angry,'' he says. Two thousand people from Cullman came to the funeral home. Four years later, he married a widow about his age, Yvette Wright. Wright has three children, is an excellent bowler and sometimes attends church wearing tailored leopard-print suits with matching shoes. ''Everything she does is snappy,'' says her college classmate Henrietta Moore. ''She's an undercover Michelle. She just keeps her sleeves on!''
 Yvette works as a jobs counselor in Birmingham, and she and Fields divide their time between her home there and his in Colony, a neat, modest, cream-colored house with a pond in front. The community itself is struggling. There are churches, but no stores. Yet Fields says blacks don't move up to Cullman, where the services are much better, because ''they still remember going through the back door of these businesses and only being able to shop at certain places. I hear some of them say: 'We ain't gonna go up there with them white folk. We're gonna stay here in our place.' ''
 Four days a week, Fields drives an hour to the plain redbrick building outside Birmingham that is St. James United Methodist Church of Irondale, where he has been the pastor for four years. People in Cullman frequently say Fields's work as a minister is one reason he can ''connect so well with constituents,'' as Judge Chaney puts it, but in Alabama, blacks and whites still mostly attend separate churches, and few whites from Cullman have ever been to Irondale to see him preach. 
 In Cullman, the large Methodist and Baptist churches have bands and video screens and even Starbucks coffee. Irondale is another world. The day I attended, there were five people in the choir. The small congregation sang ''Order My Steps'' -- ''The world is ever-changing but you are still the same''-- before Fields, in his black robe and a vivid green stole, gave a sermon that sounded like a page taken from ''The Souls of Black Folk,'' in which W.E.B. Du Bois explained the ''double consciousness'' of African-American lives, blacks' propensity to see themselves through the eyes of whites. Again and again, in a variety of cadences, Fields urged his congregation, ''Don't let others define who you are.'' 
 Afterward in the vestry a group of young Birmingham professionals talked with Fields about how difficult it is to change what Stan Mahand, who works for an electrical utility, called ''the perception'' whites have of blacks.
 ''We do anything outside the box, we're in trouble,'' Fields concurred. 
 A nurse named Delphine Powell said that younger whites don't want to be prejudged as racists any more than blacks want to be seen as victims. Mahand granted her that. ''African-Americans feel the stigma of our past as well as white people,'' he said. ''Nobody likes it. We can't never get past all that vintage black-and-white footage. The South is like a sinner who wants to go forward, but there's always a reminder thrown up to him of his past. '' 
 ''That's the sermon today,'' Fields said. ''We let people define who we are, we get held back.'' 
 Then someone brought up Artur Davis. The group supports him but was convinced of three things: in places like Cullman, Davis's race will cost him; his success hinges on Obama's; he has a problematic handshake. ''It's like he never worked hard,'' said Mahand's wife, Genice. ''I like a man with rough hands!'' Powell looked at Fields, who was gazing at his own palms, and then started laughing. ''James drives this big pickup, and Cullman, they like him!'' she said. ''They think he's a good ol' boy!''
 MOST MORNINGS FIELDS reaches Cullman before 6 a.m. and parks his truck outside one of the dozens of cafes and barbecue joints where groups of white men are having a little breakfast with their politics. Politics has always been theater in the small-town South, and like the generations of slow-talking, quick-witted country boys before him who solved the problems of the world from a bench outside the crossroads store, Fields lives for the daily chewing of the fatback. Through the door he walks, beaming, backslapping and trading in exuberant deprecations: ''Lord have mercy! I got a head cold, I'm wore out from runnin' around, I'm behind in everything, I'm in a shambles, but I just saw the dentist and my teeth are fine!'' He knows every man at every table, knows who has a new girlfriend -- ''She must be blind!'' -- whose tomatoes are ripe, who supports the Alabama Crimson Tide, who sides with the Auburn Tigers, and he is a master at the playful male art of pretending to get something crucial wrong so a man can tell that Fields really knows: Fields to an Auburn fan -- ''Did I hear you say 'Roll Tide' the other day?!'' Soon he is in the thick of debates about the future of gambling in the Bible Belt, which dry neighboring county will next go wet and the quality of Artur Davis's handshake. Some here also say it needs work. 
 Everybody, of course, knows Fields -- which means he spends most of any meal rising, extending his own dead-bolt grip and enthusing: ''Yes, sir! My good friend!'' to yet another chicken farmer in a ''Jesus Is Boss'' cap who has come by to complain about ''tax-and-spend socialism,'' to ask for ''some of that stimulus money'' and to let Fields know that he has ''a little problem'' to discuss. Offering aid and counsel is what Fields does for a living, although he always refers to his job as ''helping people.'' When he worked for the state, much of Fields's business was detecting unemployment fraud -- those who earn money while accepting checks from the government -- but he became known for turning sham into virtue. ''I was helping them out at the same time I was investigating them,'' he says. ''It's just like in the Bible, they'd bring people to Jesus Christ to be healed, he'd heal them and tell them to go and sin no more. I'd tell them, I know how it is to be poor. What can you pay back a month?'' Anyone with ''the desire and willingness to work'' could count on Fields. So could organizations providing inexpensive electricity, care for battered women, children, invalids, felons and drug addicts. ''I was,'' he says, ''a community organizer.'' Since Obama's election, that is a term, like ''Democrat,'' ''liberal'' and ''taker,'' that around Cullman has become a disparaging euphemism for African-Americans, though, people hasten to say, not Fields. ''James Fields,'' you will hear whites explain again and again, ''is one of us.'' 
 Fields has no office in Cullman -- he comes to you. Most of the county seems to know his cellphone number, with a result that, like an old-time family doctor thrust into the wireless age, Fields's days unfold from house call to house call. Cullman County teems with civic groups, and they all want to hear from Fields. ''James Fields spoke to us,'' a Lioness Club member named Kaye Harbison told me. ''Those old ladies went up and hugged him. It's wonderful that they did, but I couldn't believe it.''
 Fields still dresses well in cuff links and cuffed glen-plaid trousers, which only emphasizes how different he appears from the down-home people he represents -- until they start talking, whereupon he really seems like just another Southerner, albeit one metabolically attuned to the relentless hum of retail politics. Outside the annual February legislative session in Montgomery, the job application for a state representative is much like the job itself. As soon as Fields's cell finally quiets, he's immediately thinking it's been a while since he has been over to see a tall, good-looking, thrice-married used-auto-parts dealer named Rickey Peek. 
 ''Rickey Peek hates Obama, oh, man, but he likes me!'' Fields says on the way into Peek's shop. ''Rick and I go back before politics. I stopped a licensing bill that would have hurt his business. I told Rickey: 'You got to quit watching Fox and listening to Rush. You gotta quit that stuff. It's gonna kill you!' '' It's true that Peek looks as if he's going to jump out of his Levi's at the mention of Obama -- ''Guy hates America! Hates this country! Hates you and me both!'' -- and he thinks even less of unions, but Fields has only to boom, ''This is where the poor man keeps his car running!'' and from behind the counter comes a gleeful ''They let you out of Montgomery?!'' Peek starts talking about excessive White House spending and again gets so worked up so fast that you worry he himself may soon be on the market for fresh parts. But before long, Fields has his arm around Peek's shoulder and is leaning close to his ear, whispering that ''you need to quit falling in love every time you meet a pretty woman, especially when she has a child.''
 Once, when I visited Peek's shop alone, Peek told me: ''James is not like any black man that I know. He's just different. He just don't have that mentality, anybody owes him anything. He just gets out and works and helps people, earns what he gets. If James wasn't black, you'd think he was white. That doesn't sound right, but you know what I mean.'' 
 Everybody in Cullman knows what he means, perhaps most especially the men who gather weekday mornings at a round table at the All Steak restaurant, where many of them spent much of this past year not getting over the fact of an African-American president. The group fortified themselves with daily doses of rue -- ''Thought I'd never see it''-- dared one another to use ''the N-word'' in front of a Yankee and shared memories of how Cullman used to be -- ''They were afraid to come to town.'' One day in September, a retired Alabama state trooper named Charlie Shafer leaned back from his eggs and asked, ''Have you all ever stopped to consider how much better off the country would be if Obama'd been. . . . '' Quick and fast came the replies: 
 ''White.''
 ''Died in childbirth.''
 Periodically, Fields's name came up, and people leapt to describe what ''a hard-working, down-to-earth person'' he is. It was recurrent. Harsh expressions of disdain for blacks in general would smoothly give way to admiration for the black individual in their midst. The dichotomy was expressed in a particularly blunt way by a jeweler named Richard White. ''Cullman's the best-kept secret in the South,'' White said. ''Low-key. Everybody gets along. And the three-tenths of 1 percent might have something to do with it.'' Then, without any kind of transition, he added: ''James is a good friend of mine. He's a good man. He's straight. He's honest. He's well educated.'' 
 When I asked Rozalyn Love, the medical student, about the daily scene at the All Steak, she said that in Cullman, ''there's almost to some degree pride about being a little bit notorious.'' Then she added, ''They're a lot less racist there than some of them would like people to think they are.'' This is undoubtedly true; it's not 1964 anymore. Many older white people from Cullman also believe that attitudes toward race are slowly shifting. ''My children have a different view of racial makeup than I had,'' says Judge Chaney. ''From my father's generation -- extremely prejudiced -- to mine -- we're working through it -- to my children, race is a nonissue. That's not to say there still aren't racial tensions, whether it be black or Hispanic.'' 
 The owner of a classic-car rebuilding shop, Jerry Burgess, made a similar generational point one day at his garage when he described something he saw in the 1960s and has never forgotten. Burgess is a bootlegger's son with long, stringy hair under a dirty cap, a ZZ Top beard, an arm sleeved in tattoos and friendly eyes. ''I can remember when the sign was on the edge of Cullman, down on Highway 31, close to the tracks,'' he told me. ''It said 'Don't Let the Sun Go Down on a Nigger at Night.' I can't hardly say the word. My kids raise Cain about it. A lot of old-timers still use the word. My uncle does. Don't think a thing about it. He's a little old-fashioned. To me it seems like a very different time. Now most people would be O.K. with black people.'' 
 Still, when Cecil Parker, a retired African-American construction worker who grew up near Colony, thinks about race relations in Alabama, he says: ''It's better, but it's not great. Some know better. Some don't care. Same people who did all the hanging and burning are still alive. They were taught against us. That we weren't human. Alabama do not like black folk telling him what to do.'' 
 That Fields evaluated this situation and sensed he could win an election remains a source of wonder among Alabama political insiders. ''Other legislators,'' he says, ''still ask me, 'How'd you do that?!' I look at them, 'How'd I do what?' It's not like I woke up and hoped people would vote for me.'' But of course he was aware of what he was up against. The famous phrase that V. O. Key invented to describe the intensely localized, almost tribal nature of Alabamians at the polls is ''friends and neighbors'' voting. Key's insight was that Alabama voters prefer political representatives who lived close by, even when the more distant figure might better speak to issues of common concern. A result, according to Morris Dees, the founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, is that ''I haven't seen a lot of coming together in a shared cause.'' Thus, the enduring importance of some feeling of personal connection: of a handshake, of being able to say a candidate embraces my values, if not my plight. In small communities like Cullman, there is an aversion to the intensely mediated sense of experience that the Internet has brought to so much American life -- and to American politics. Fierce Southern resistance to political messages of change has a lot to do with belief in the value of immediate encounters and a primary fear of strangers and outsiders -- especially black or Northern ones -- who may bring harm. ''Folks down here kind of like to touch and feel the merchandise'' is the way a Cullman banker named Dan W. Mann puts it. So the problem for Fields as a candidate amounted to a fundamental, transformative question about race in the white South: could a black man be considered a friend and a neighbor? 
 The candidate who ran against Fields in the special election was Wayne Willingham. The difference between Fields's devoted life of public service and his opponent's sparser record was stark. Further, a Cullman relative of Wayne's, Joe Willingham, is a reputed Klan leader. At some point, Fields says, in the Deep South, the race card ''always comes up when there are African-Americans running against whites.'' At the campaign's outset, people told Fields: ''James, it'll be hard to beat him. He'll bring out the worst in folks.'' In recent years, racial and sexual innuendo helped North Carolina's Jesse Helms and Tennessee's Bob Corker defeat black Senate opponents, and of course, race-baiting also happens locally. In 1992, Selma's white incumbent mayor, Joe T. Smitherman, prevailed against his black challenger, James Perkins, in part by renting a room, filling it with rows of elderly white women and just as many telephone lines and instructing the women to make white voters aware of what was at stake. Fields understood that to win he especially would need to neutralize resentments, fears and prejudices by blurring his color into the background where it was subordinate to his character. His life was his case, but his means of expressing it would have to be his personality.
 To explain his thinking about elections, Fields talks about Charlie Shafer. Fields says that Shafer was on active duty in 1965 in Selma, during the seminal civil rights movement demonstration that became known as Bloody Sunday after lawmen carrying clubs and tear gas attacked unarmed protesters. ''When they marched to Montgomery from Selma, he was one of the troopers,'' Fields says. ''But if he lived in my district, I think he'd vote for me. I truly believe that. Because he's gotten to know me. But then again he may not, and that's O.K.'' Fields's point was not that he was irresistible, just qualified, and that voting for him didn't have to be a big deal. The more normal it could be made to seem, the better. 
 Normal in Cullman means Christian. Conspicuous displays of faith by politicians are so common that it's a surprise when one doesn't have the Ten Commandments posted on his office wall. Accordingly, Fields began his last competition by placing a newspaper advertisement challenging Willingham to ''a race that is God-driven and Christ-centered.'' This was the only election on the ballot in the state at the time, and a black man running in Cullman was a big deal. Dozens of idealistic volunteers, most of them young and white, joined the campaign. Fields says: ''I told the outsiders, 'Don't go out in the county. Just work the city.' Out in the county there are people I grew up with, played ball with. If they went out there, some people would say, 'Who are you, boy?' '' Fields himself traveled door to door with his handshake and a message that, he says, boiled down to ''vote for me for no other reason than you know and trust me.'' 
 He continued: ''I sat beside you in churches, restaurants, parks, at funerals, on the streets of Cullman, on hospital beds.'' There were, he says, no soaring pulpit elocutions: ''I don't say anything profound. Just common, everyday things.'' 
 Early on, someone sent around a flier making reference to coon dogs, which, as Fields says, ''backfired'' in Cullman. People were, in fact, outraged on Fields's behalf, and on their own. It's one thing to be a slumberous little farming community tucked way back in the hills. But for all the Confederate flags flying out in the county, the city of Cullman today has an increasingly cosmopolitan middle class that is trying to balance chickens and sweet potatoes with a growing manufacturing presence. If you aspire to step more visibly into the world by attracting industrial investment, it doesn't help to have somebody in a passing pickup truck yelling, ''Hey, tar baby,'' at your prospective foreign client. When that happened outside a Cullman restaurant to a staunchly conservative white Cullman businessman named Barry McGriff, he saw other people's passions threatening his interests. ''We don't want that old reputation,'' McGriff says. ''It's a huge business hindrance for us. We want to be diversified.'' So it was one evening that Fields was visited by McGriff's father, Bert, who told Fields, ''We want to help you,'' and handed him a campaign donation. ''To me,'' says Barry McGriff, ''tearing the sign down was James going into office.''
 WHEN JAMES YOUNG talks about how he persuaded white voters in Mississippi to choose him as mayor instead of his three-term white opponent, he sounds a lot like Fields. Young is a former county official and a Pentecostal minister with a reputation for keeping his shoulder to the wheel and free of chips. ''It took me 30-plus years of working in this community to be where I am,'' he says. ''It did not happen overnight. I tell younger people, live your life serving people, and it will come back to benefit you.'' Young campaigned with a message that directly confronted what he calls ''the old rhetoric.'' By this he says he meant fears among whites ''that somebody is out to take something from me.'' Young says: ''I tell people, I don't want to live in your neighborhood. I don't necessarily want to go to your schools, ride on the bus with you. But give me an opportunity, and I will prove myself like any other man. I have walked honorably in front of you all. You have known me all my life. Now give me a chance to lead.'' After he won, he addressed questions about Philadelphia's violent past by saying simply: ''It's a new day. Let's move on.''
 A similar approach helped Locy Baker in southeast Alabama. A former teacher and school administrator, Baker says: ''I been living here all my days. Grew up here. People know me. I go door to door. Never stop campaigning. They saw me every day.'' Baker says he thinks that many of those who voted for him did because it might be to their financial advantage. ''The people vote for who's gonna make the area grow,'' he explains. It's an incipient phenomenon but potentially a major source of change for the American political landscape. If you're good, the possibility is improving that you can win, no matter who you are. 
 Yet when it comes to blacks running for statewide or national office, the old terms still apply. Young explains: ''Locally it's personality. It's what I know about you. Nationally you get hung up on rhetoric.'' I heard versions of this line of explanation many times from whites around Cullman, including John R. Key, a retired G.M. employee who lives outside the city. Key says of the people he knows: ''I'll be honest, they don't like Obama because of color. In local elections we feel we vote for whoever can do the best job. When it gets national, they kinda draw the line.''
 One obvious way for a statewide or national politician to respond to these conditions is by acting local. A Republican couple I spoke with several times in Cullman, Kerry and Johnny Green, say that Obama would have fared much better in Alabama had he not bypassed the state but had instead chosen to shake some hands, make his case. ''I wish he'd go to places in the country that didn't support him,'' Kerry says. I heard such regrets voiced frequently in Cullman even, paradoxically, from those who were also telling me that they could not imagine ever voting for Obama. It was personal to them; they wanted Obama to show them that they matter to him. 
 Alabama is about to put such possibilities to the immediate test with the gubernatorial primary. Sitting in his Birmingham office, Artur Davis told me he considers race to be of ''fading'' importance. He argued that he would be good for business, that places like Cullman are ''not so distinct economically'' from his mostly black Birmingham Congressional district and says he can win because ''there's no question the country is living in a time of fundamental change.'' Many Democrats have told me that Davis is among the most gifted men ever to run for office in Alabama. During my time with him, I found Davis charismatic and motivated. When I left, we shook hands. George C. Wallace was known across his state as ''a finger breaker.'' Davis is no finger breaker. 
 One of Davis's biggest supporters is Wallace's daughter, Peggy Kennedy. She says she likes Davis because ''he's compassionate and personal,'' but she worries that Alabama may still balk at electing a black in a statewide election. Zeb Little, Cullman's Democratic state senator, shares this concern. ''I don't think they're ready to elect Artur Davis governor,'' he says. ''Artur's bright, intelligent and qualified. But he'll be more closely aligned with Obama than with James Fields. James grew up here. Played ball here. Worked hard. Has done the things white people in this community have done. Artur's got a great story, but it's not a story the average Alabamian can identify with. He went to Harvard. People vote for people who they perceive as like them or somebody they want to be like. Artur's a little different. He'd do a good job, but it's an uphill battle.'' I mention the handshake. ''He's tightened it up,'' Little says. 
 When Davis visited Cullman recently, he gave a speech at Jack's Truck Stop. To a room crowded with people, Davis repeated several times, ''I'm running on James Fields's coattails!'' Fields attended, and afterward he was jubilant. ''Congressman Davis wooed the crowd!'' Fields enthused. ''He did a job! He did 'em a job!'' And yet Fields couldn't help noticing that Little, like almost every other elected Democrat in Cullman County, stayed away from the event. Many of those absent candidates stand to share the party ticket with Davis in November. They were making a show of distancing themselves. Fields understands the impulse. He, too, would be on the ticket with Davis, and much as Fields admires Davis, the situation makes him uneasy for reasons that seem to boil down to this: for all his efforts in Cullman, Fields is still not one of them. 
 FIELDS'S FIRST APPOINTMENT every week is with his 6:30 a.m. Monday men's prayer group, which gathers for breakfast at a restaurant in Cullman. ''We talk about our personal lives, our faith journey,'' he says. The group began 25 years ago when Dr. George Lyrene and Rob Werner, the owner of Werner's Trading Company, wanted a means of regular reflection and solace. In time, Fields, Bob Burgess, the principal of Hanceville High School, and Mac Buttram, a Methodist pastor, joined them. All except Fields are white. When Fields's wife Willie Mae died, Buttram had a part in the funeral. When Fields married Yvette, Buttram presided. Fields gave me the sense that he relies heavily on the others, speaking of his intentions to ''discuss it with my prayer group'' whenever something weighed on him. 
 Most people in Cullman would be surprised to learn that anything ever weighs on Fields, least of all his race. He generally addresses that subject only by joking it off the table, calling out in greeting, ''This guy used to beat up black people for fun!'' or referring to blacks' supposed inability to swim: ''We went in the creek. We thought we were swimming, but we were standing up!'' 
 Much of the time Fields also sounds sanguine about his pioneering life representing Cullman County. ''I enjoy serving,'' he says. ''I think that is one of the most rewarding positions a person can be in. I see it in both the political and the Christian world. Love, hope, grace, mercy, God gives us a choice. You choose each day who you're gonna serve. As a politician we choose. Every day we choose who to give grant money to, who you're gonna vote with, talk to. Personally, I'm thinking, How will this help the people I represent? How will this affect the people I serve? How will this make a better community? I know there are people out there rather spit on the ground than spit on me and put a fire out. For every one of them full of hatred, there are 10 who've made it worthwhile.'' 
 But along with this optimistic self-possession, another side to Fields operates in watchful counterpoint. Wherever he goes he is exercising a probing intuition, always seeing himself as others may be seeing him, taking pains never to make people feel he wants anything from them. It bothers Fields that there are no black employees in the Cullman court, schools, on the police force or in any of the city's banks, that the Cullman custom of hanging a photograph of the president in the county commission's office at the courthouse ended the day Obama took office. Fields hasn't complained because he says he can't think of a way to persuade people that he would be doing so for the greater good. In his attempts to make white people see beyond his race, every day he is making many of the same calculations black men were making a hundred years ago in the South, rising above the men who still call him ''boy,'' the elderly women who return his greeting by staring hard at the floor. ''If you're gonna survive in this world, you chew the cheese,'' he says. ''I learned a long time ago, a lot of stuff you have to sit there and take and hope something good'll come of it. Smile and grin when they make a racial joke or say, 'You know them niggers,' and laugh.'' 
 In these moments, I had some sense of how precarious and vulnerable it could feel to be Fields, driving alone every day into Cullman, where he is an outsider at the center of things. Cullman can seem like a very remote place. During the day pickups, flatbed trailers stacked with chicken crates and logging trucks crowd streets like Second Avenue SW. After dark, these broad, silent boulevards increase the potent sense of isolation that comes on at night in a farming community. ''You feel,'' Fields says, ''what can you feel -- you go on. So many houses, you know you're the first black in the house. You're in Cullman. I listen to them talking and I feel out of place. I never feel unwelcome, but I do feel strange. I think, God almighty, are we still living in this society?'' During another conversation he said, ''I find myself, a lot of times, I'm living what other people perceive me to be. That is what makes my life so miserable. I can't get away. I can't really be who I am.'' Shifting between Cullman, Colony and Irondale means, he says, ''I have to live, like, two frigging lives.'' 
 All politicians feel the anxiety of audience, the strain of meeting competing public expectations. Few, however, live multiple personal narratives. Persevering under such circumstances, Fields emanates the quality that makes him so good at his job -- his enormous capacity for putting aside his own problems so as to understand those of others. It's the rare person in a position of power who never forgets that life is hard for most people.
 Every voter I met in Cullman predicts that Fields will be easily re-elected in November. Politicians from both parties praise him as a skilled, nonideological representative. He has worked to decrease overcrowding in the state's public schools and prisons, to deflect taxes from small business owners and to prevent spouses of the deceased from losing their health insurance. He and Jeremy Oden, the ebullient Republican who represents the east side of Cullman County, are known around Montgomery to function in such effective tandem for Cullman that they have won an admiring, off-color nickname -- the Panda. Only Fields himself seems to have any doubts about his political future. ''The Republicans smell blood,'' he told me in December. Like all Democrats in Alabama, he will be ''tied,'' he says, to Obama -- ''the supposed debacle.'' At first I thought this was a savvy politician's standard caution about the future. Then I began to think of how Fields has spent his life skillfully assessing who among those nearby might bring him misfortune. Among the first things he told me is, ''I'm running for re-election, but I'm not going to deny who I am.'' Careful as he is, he must have known that this kind of candor would expose him to political risk. 
 ON AN OCTOBER Sunday, Fields opened his Cullman Times and read some news he found troubling. Mac Buttram had decided to run as a Republican for Fields's seat. The next morning, when the prayer group met, the other three members were livid. ''I can't tell you how mad I am at you,'' Werner told Buttram. ''You're saying the group means nothing to you.'' Buttram replied, ''I never thought about the group.'' He told the others this was what God was guiding him to do. To me, Buttram, who has led churches in several Alabama counties, explained that wherever he now lived, he would run, ''because I could do a better job as state representative.'' The retired pastor also said, ''The people of Cullman County and their principles are better represented by a Republican.'' How, I asked him, was Fields failing Cullman? ''I honestly can't say there's a specific thing James has not represented well,'' he replied. Werner, Burgess and Lyrene have all vowed to support Fields. ''James is a compassionate, caring, balanced person who struggles to do the right thing whether it's politically popular or not,'' Lyrene says. ''His political strength is he gets involved with people at every level.'' 
 One such person is an African-American mechanic named Eugene Wilson. Fields watched Wilson, who is 34, grow up in Colony and describes him as someone who ''was never a troublemaker. He just didn't take any mess.'' As a teenager, Wilson would come into Cullman, where, Wilson says, ''guys in trucks with big rebel flags would try to run you out of town. They'd chase us. They were calling us niggers. 'Y'all need to get out of town. This town's supposed to be white.' We were like, 'This is the '90s! This stuff is not supposed to happen in the United States.' '' When Wilson stayed at his white girlfriend's house out in the county, in 1998, the couple received a visit from the Klan. ''They were dressed up in their suits,'' Wilson says. ''They were saying they'd kill me if I didn't leave.'' He left.
 Wilson took a job in Cullman, and soon, weary of the Colony commute, he moved into town, where he remains, one of the only blacks living in the city. Since 2005, he has been married to a woman named Melody, who is white. ''We still get dirty looks,'' he says, ''but a lot has changed. I've grown to feel comfortable here. Now I'm just trying to be an upstanding person in the community.'' For inspiration, he says, he looks to Fields. ''He was always in church, always did things for his family. If he can do it, I can do it. This is what they've been preaching on, teaching us. The biggest dreams in Colony were to own a store or a small business. To have a state representative? Our voice has been heard.''

HEADLINE: Class Dismissed

BYLINE: By WALTER KIRN. 
Walter Kirn, a frequent contributor, is the author of ''Lost in the Meritocracy'' and the novel ''Up in the Air.''

 BODY:
According to the unwritten constitution that governs ordinary American life and makes possible a shared pop culture that even new immigrants can jump right into after a few movies and a trip to the mall, the senior year of public high school is less a climactic academic experience than an occasion for oafish goofing off, chronic truancy, random bullying, sloppy dancing in rented formalwear and interludes of moody, wan philosophizing (often at sunrise while still half-drunk and staring off at a misty river or the high-school parking lot) about the looming bummer of adulthood. In films like ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off,'' ''Dazed and Confused'' and ''High School Musical 3,'' senior year is a do-little sabbatical from what is presented as the long dull labor of acquiring knowledge, honing skills and internalizing social norms. It's a spree, senior year, that discharges built-up tensions. It's an adolescent Mardi Gras. 
And it's not an indulgence but an entitlement. Remember that line in your yearbook? Seniors rule! And they rule not because they've accomplished much, necessarily (aside from surviving to age 18 or so and not dropping out or running away from home), but because it's tradition, and seniors crave tradition. They crave it because they know, deep down, they're lost, and tradition helps them hide this fear. From juniors.
 This year of licensed irresponsibility, this two-semester recurring national holiday, was threatened recently in Utah by a Republican legislator's proposal to do away with 12th grade entirely. The idea was advanced as a budget-cutting measure -- a way to shave millions from the cash-strapped state's expense sheet -- and it called forth the sort of instant, intense hostility that often signals that an inspired notion, truly innovative, truly new, has, by some miracle, entered politics. The proposal drew scorn from teachers and students alike (another tribute to its possible genius) and swiftly spread across the news wires, eliciting such hostility and controversy that its sponsor flinched. Aware, perhaps, that his offbeat plan was drawing unwelcome attention to a state that has spent the modern era in a permanent defensive crouch thanks to a Mormon religious culture that many view as joyless and eccentric, the lawmaker suggested that 12th grade -- that ritual time out from the march of time itself -- be made optional rather than nonexistent. 
 But did he compromise too readily? For many American high-school seniors, especially the soberest and most studious, senior year is a holding pattern, a redundancy, a way of running out the clock on a game that has already been won. When winter vacation rolls around, many of them, thanks to college early-admissions programs, know all they need to about their futures and have no more reason to hang around the schoolhouse than prehistoric fish had need for water once they grew limbs and could crawl out of the oceans. As for students who aren't headed to four-year colleges but two-year community colleges or vocational schools, why not just get started early and read ''Moby Dick'' for pleasure, if they wish, rather than to earn a grade that they don't need? Kids who plan to move right into the labor force are in the same position. They may as well spend the whole year in detention -- which some of them, bored and restless, end up doing. Twelfth grade, for the sorts of students I've just described, amounts to a fidgety waiting period that practically begs for descents into debauchery and concludes in a big dumb party under a mirror ball that spins in place like the minds of those beneath it.
 It's not just one Utah lawmaker who has noticed this. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has, too, it seems. In the interest of speeding students on their way to productive, satisfying careers, the foundation intends to give a $1.5 million grant to a project organized by the nonprofit National Center on Education and the Economy. The goal is to help certain students leapfrog the keg party and go directly from 10th grade to community colleges after passing a battery of tests. The goal is not to save money but precious time, and the program is modeled on systems now in place in Denmark, Finland, France and Singapore -- countries whose young folk, in many cases, speak English more grammatically than a lot of American high-school seniors do. One of the fledgling program's backers, Terry Holliday, Kentucky's commissioner of education, calls the program's approach ''move on when ready.'' Compared with the prevailing current system, which might be termed ''move on when all your friends do'' or ''move on when stir-crazy'' or just ''move on,'' it seems both more pragmatic and humane, not to mention more likely to raise the G.D.P.
 If senior year were to vanish from our high schools, either completely or in part, would its infamous excesses, feats of sloth, dances and stretches of absenteeism shift to junior year? To some degree. But what also might happen is that the education process, if it was shortened and compressed some, might help kids think more clearly about their paths in life and set out on them on the right foot instead of waiting to shape up later on. And what would they miss, really, under such a system? As someone who left high school a year early thanks to an offer from a progressive college that I didn't seek but hungrily accepted (anything to escape those hours of ''study hall'' that we passed by folding sheets of paper until they couldn't be folded any tighter, at which point we flicked them at one another's heads), I guess I wouldn't know. But I did learn from my visits home that my former classmates' senior years did them few favors maturationwise, other than to make one an unwed mother and a couple of them into victims of major car collisions. That's why, to my mind, Utah should feel free to ax senior year, bank the savings and see what happens. My hunch is that nothing will happen. Nothing much. Just the loss of a year when nothing much happens anyhow.

HEADLINE: The Baby-Sitter Contract

BYLINE: By RANDY COHEN

 BODY:
Last fall my wife and I hired a young woman to care for our two children two days a week. We'd been left in the lurch before, so we insisted that she commit for the school year. We felt similarly committed to her. I now find that I'll lose my job in April, so we won't need day care. I want to lay her off, likening my situation to her having a medical emergency that renders her unable to work. My wife says we must pay her through June. You? NAME WITHHELD, TACOMA, WASH.
 I agree with your wife. You insisted on a commitment that locked in the young woman's job for the school year, even if she won the lottery or was invited to go on the road with Beyonce or became queen of Neptune. That it was instead your situation that changed doesn't efface your mutual obligation. By committing to you for the school year, she gave up other potential opportunities for yearlong employment. You can't simply stiff her. Here's what would be akin to her facing a medical emergency: your facing a medical emergency. But it's your job, not your health, that has collapsed. 
 As an ethical and (as I, a nonlawyer, understand it) a legal matter, the oral agreement you and she made constitutes a contract, albeit unwritten. Your current uncertainty is a good argument for having a written contract. Negotiating its terms compels you to make your mutual obligations explicit. When you hired her, you could have proposed an out for emergencies, whether medical, economic or that familiar pairing of the theological and the meteorological: come hell or high water.
 As things stand, you might help her find another job. If she can line something up for those two days a week, she might waive your obligation to her. Or you might offer her one month's severance pay: you save some money; she saves some time. But she must agree to either option; you may not simply impose them on her.
 My 9-year-old son, who has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (A.D.H.D.), was prescribed medication and is doing much better in school and plays much better in his midweek Little League baseball games. He does not take medication on weekends. Would it be ethical to give it to him on a Saturday if he's pitching in a big game? His doctor sees no health risk. In fact, by keeping the dosage constant, my son might be more comfortable, avoiding the ''ramp up'' and ''ramp down'' effect. NAME WITHHELD, PARSIPPANY, N.J.
 Some drugs used to treat A.D.H.D. can indeed improve nonclassroom performance. Hence the popularity of similar, illicitly acquired stimulants in many endeavors. Should your son use his meds not as intended, but as a performance-enhancing drug for baseball? Luckily, I have Mark McGwire right here, and he'll continue writing this response. . . . O.K., I don't have Mark McGwire. I have Roger Clemens. Of course not. I have an overdeveloped sense of sarcasm. (Overdeveloped naturally, not via sarcasm-enhancing drugs.) And I have confidence that we both know the answer to your question. In ethics, intention counts. Here, yours is to give your son a drug he wouldn't otherwise take on game days, with the sole purpose of his gaining an advantage on the field. That's the difference between a side effect and an effect, between medicating and cheating, between ethical and unethical.
 The distinction is not always so clear. Had your son's doctor recommended that your son take his meds all week long -- a reasonable prescription, as the doctor himself suggests -- your son would still gain an edge in his ball games, but that would not be unethical. Nor would he be regarded as a cheater if (when he got a little older) he underwent Lasik surgery to improve his vision. But what if he deliberately raised it to 20/15, better than normal, to improve his game, something Tiger Woods is said to have done? There is a quandary here, one that will be increasingly tough for parents, teachers and coaches to sort out. (And I don't mean citing Tiger Woods in the context of moral reasoning.)

HEADLINE: Kia's Economic Stimulus Package

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
KIA would never admit it, even if executives in Seoul imbibed too much soju one night. But they have to be thinking that maybe this recession isn't such a bad thing. 
 With American car sales sputtering like an old Chevy Citation -- an appropriate reference, given that the numbers have tumbled to 1980s levels -- only three major brands managed increases in 2009. One was Subaru, and the others were the South Korean tag team of Kia and Hyundai, whose specialty is tailored for hard times: cutting competitors off at the knees with lower prices and long warranties. 
 And, just as important, they are selling vastly improved cars that more Americans are starting to view as interchangeable with highfalutin' Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans, not to mention the wares from Detroit. 
 That competitive strategy continues with the Kia Forte (pronounced for-TAY). At first glance, it's another unassuming compact front-drive sedan with four doors, 4 cylinders and a trunk, the kind of car you'd barely notice if it ran you down in the street. That describes most cars in this practical class, but the Forte butts bumpers with two of the toughest, longest-running rivals in autodom, the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla. 
 There are other formidable opponents, too. The Ford Focus is an old reliable. Mazda aims its terrific 3 at the sporty set. Chevy is preparing to switch out its creaky Cobalt for the all-new Cruze, and Nissan has its Sentra. And don't forget the Forte's sister car, the better-known Hyundai Elantra. 
 Yet despite its underdog status, the Forte cedes nothing to its brand-name rivals in styling, price, performance, fuel economy or features. For the value buyer -- including parents whose patronage allows their offspring to drive a new car -- Kia's warranty is another comforting point. 
 The Forte comes with bumper-to-bumper protection for five years or 60,000 miles, powertrain coverage for 10 years or 100,000 miles and roadside assistance for five years or 60,000 miles. In comparison, the Honda Civic has bumper-to-bumper coverage of three years or 36,000 miles, a powertrain warranty of five years or 60,000 miles and no roadside assistance.
 One goal of any economy car should be to look more expensive than it is. The Forte succeeds handsomely, with broad, tailored shoulders and the modern wedge shape of small cars in Europe. Credit for the confident shape goes to Kurt Kahl, a designer at Kia's California studio.
 As on the two-door version of the Forte, called the Koup, the exterior pays mild homage to the Civic. Yet inside, the Kia actually improves on the Honda's too-precious futurism with a more straightforward ergonomic layout and more standard goodies. Materials, except for distressingly vinyl-esque leather that is, thankfully, an option, are average-to-better for the class. The back seat is spacious for two tall adults, with a center perch for a third that's more useful than in some rivals. The trunk, with capacity of 14.7 cubic feet, is the roomiest in its competitive set. 
 Storage is generous, with bottle holders in the front doors, a deep center console and the kind of large, open central cubby that some larger cars overlook -- the perfect resting place for keys, BlackBerries and what have you.
 Standard hookups include a U.S.B. port for an iPod, an auxiliary jack and two 12-volt outlets. Even the least expensive sedan, the $14,390 LX, comes with a free three-month subscription to Sirius Satellite Radio. 
 Even the bargain-basement LX has six standard air bags, electronic traction and stability control; antilock brakes with brake assist and electronic force distribution; active front head restraints and seat belts in all five positions, with belt height adjusters up front. But air-conditioning is part of a $1,500 package that includes a split folding rear seat and a rear armrest with cup holders.
 For any model, add $1,000 for an automatic transmission -- either a 4-speed on the LX and EX or a 5-speed with manual-shift function on the SX. (The SX's standard gearbox is a 6-speed manual rather than the 5-speed units on other versions.)
 I first drove an EX automatic, which started at $17,690 and reached $19,490 with the $1,000 leather package (which included heated seats, steering wheel and shift knob) and an $800 sunroof. 
 A 2-liter 4-cylinder engine with variable valve timing gives the LX and EX models a solid 156 horsepower and 144 pound-feet of torque. The motor is workmanlike, though it doesn't rev like Honda's silken 4-cylinder engines. And it is good for 25 miles per gallon in the city and 34 on the highway with either transmission. 
 An optional $600 fuel economy package adds gas-saving tricks like electric power steering, an intermittent alternator, low-rolling-resistance tires and aerodynamic tweaks. It lifts the EX's mileage to a class-leading 27/36 m.p.g.
 But there's an interesting player in the lineup: The SX, which brings a touch of sport to a largely plain-vanilla class, but costs thousands less than true performance-oriented compacts like the Mazda 3 s or Honda Civic Si. 
 The SX's 2.4-liter engine spins out 173 horsepower and 168 pound-feet of torque, more juice than the Mazda's optional 2.5-liter (167 horsepower), but less than Honda's 2-liter (197).
 That larger SX engine gets somewhat raspy in its highest registers, but the useful midrange torque and passing power more than make up for the added sound. The throttle feels sluggish off the line, but the engine will yank the Kia from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in 8.6 seconds, according to Edmunds.com, which is just 0.5 second behind the peppy Mazda. For its $18,190 base price, the SX also comes with a firmer suspension, larger front brakes and sportier 17-inch wheels and tires. 
 Edmunds also reported that the Forte SX ran through its slalom course at a surprisingly brisk 67.6 m.p.h., just 1 m.p.h. slower than the Mazda 3 s; the Kia also pulled an eye-opening 0.86 g's of lateral cornering force on a skidpad.
 But track numbers don't necessarily translate into action on the street. In real-world driving, the SX is reasonably fun to toss around, but when speeds really climb the Forte's chassis isn't as impeccably composed as the Mazda's. 
 But while the Kia can't match the Mazda's handling or the Civic Si's high-revving refinement, those cars can run into the mid-$20,000s, a whole league above the Forte. 
 For budget shoppers, including generous parents, saving $500 here or $1,000 there can tip the scales in a car's favor. If that budget demands a sedan in the sweet spot between $15,000 and $20,000, the Forte's more-for-less strategy becomes especially compelling -- unless you're willing to pay more to polish a Honda or Toyota badge. 
 INSIDE TRACK: Running with the big dogs now.

HEADLINE: One Roof, Three Generations

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
EARLY this month, three generations of the Delfino family moved into the 3,400-square-foot stone and stucco home they designed for themselves in Port Jefferson Station.
 Mike Delfino Jr., 52, and his wife, Maria, 49, took the master suite on the right side of the first floor. Their sons, ages 16 and 20, have bedrooms upstairs and a large game room that could be a living room if they decided to boomerang back home as adults. 
 ''If they get married,'' their father said, ''there is room for them to have their wives there and get a start.'' 
 On the left side of the first floor is another master suite, with sitting room and bath, for Mrs. Delfino's mother, Anne Calaci, 84, who is making the transition to the Delfinos' new spread from her home in Mineola.
 After Mrs. Calaci's husband died four years ago, the Delfinos wanted her to move into the 2,200-square-foot center-hall colonial they then owned, also in Port Jefferson Station. She balked.
 ''The other home was so small she thought she was going to be in our way,'' said Mr. Delfino, the owner of an insulation company.
 In response, the family decided to design a place that would accommodate their multigenerational needs.
 ''When we married and had the little ones,'' Mr. Delfino said, Mr. and Mrs. Calaci ''were there for us every step of the way. It's time to pay back.''
 Across the Island, builders are emphasizing versatility in their designs, putting up homes easily adaptable for multiple generations seeking to live under one roof. Lennard Axinn, the Delfinos' builder and the owner of Island Estates Homes in Ronkonkoma, said he had found strong customer interest in houses ''customizable for a wide variety of needs.''
 ''On the practical side,'' Mr. Axinn added, ''the sandwich generation has kids to raise and parents to be the guardian of.'' In a home he recently finished in a new subdivision, the grandfather has living quarters in the basement with a separate entrance. 
 ''It's the only market with a pulse,'' Mr. Axinn said. 
 That may be because buying a house conceived with multiple generations in mind makes a lot more sense to a forward-thinking buyer than trying to retrofit a smaller, more conventional house.
 The number of households nationwide with more than two generations expanded to 6.2 million in 2008, from 5 million in 2000, according to AARP. 
 Stephen Melman, the director of economic services at the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group in Washington, said that at its International Builders' Show in Las Vegas in January, the model ''new American home'' included, on opposite ends of the house, a master bedroom for the owners and a second master bedroom for their parents. The design allowed room for privacy and ''acoustical separation,'' he said. 
 The second master, also known as the in-law suite, ''doesn't have to be enormous in terms of floor area,'' Mr. Melman said, ''but it must be complete, with closet space and a full bathroom.'' When smartly designed, it would include accessible ''universal design elements'' like nonslip floors, a step-free shower entrance and doorways that could accommodate a wheelchair, so that an aging owner wouldn't have to look elsewhere for user-friendly housing. 
 The same quarters might also be used by adult children returning from college who ''might make too much noise or need privacy,'' Mr. Melman added, or for a caregiver for the owner. Flexibility is important. If the caregiver moved out, the room could become an office.
 Douglas Schmieder, a builder in Southampton whose cedar-sided postmodern homes average $1 million, said that four of the eight houses he had built for clients in the last two to three years had included ''separate living quarters'' with kitchens, in anticipation of elderly parents or a college student returning home after graduation. ''Generally it is on the ground level with a separate access'' and an open layout, he said.
 Steven Kosoff, a builder in Matinecock, recently completed a 7,000-square-foot turreted house in Upper Brookville, which he has listed at $2.95 million. The floor-to-ceiling limestone fireplace in the great room, the lavish oversized kitchen and the elevator shaft are not its only draws. Double doors off the foyer lead to a 26-by-16-foot in-law suite with a full bath, including whirlpool tub and separate shower, while the main master bedroom is one of five upstairs. 
 Mr. Kosoff described the shingle and brick home, set on two acres, as easily customizable. The ground-floor suite could be divided if an owner wanted a sitting room or it could be configured as a library. 
 Joseph Fusaro, the owner of AMJ Building in Huntington, was inspired by the work he did converting part of his own home for his mother-in-law to build a 3,500-square-foot Victorian-style home on Cuba Hill Road with multigenerational options already built in. The rear wing on the first floor is geared to returning adult children or elderly parents -- with a separate entrance, its own bath and easy access to the kitchen. 
 ''We wanted to be versatile,'' Mr. Fusaro said. ''Multigenerational is something people are looking for.'' Others could use the space as a playroom or office. 
 Even when the need is not imminent, Mr. Schmieder said, his homes have preinstalled rough plumbing and electrical lines, in case homeowners want to finish accessory living quarters later on. He generally designs with expansion plans for 1,000 to 1,500 extra feet. ''When people build,'' he said, ''they want to accommodate for that.'' 
 Christopher Burnside, a broker and senior director of the Bridgehampton office of Brown Harris Stevens, and a builder on the East End, said a significant number of home shoppers were asking for ''first-floor master bedrooms for their parents.''
 Accordingly, in designing the 6,000-square-foot modern farmhouse he is building overlooking polo fields in Bridgehampton, he has included a master suite on the first floor and a second one upstairs. Four bedrooms will be on the other side of the house. 
 ''Builders are giving people what they want,'' Mr. Burnside said. ''No one wants to put their mother in the basement.''

HEADLINE: School District in North Carolina Considers Ending Busing for Economic Diversity

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
RALEIGH, N.C. -- When Rosemarie Wilson moved her family to a wealthy suburb of Raleigh a couple of years ago, the biggest attraction was the prestige of the local public schools. Then she started talking to neighbors.
 Don't believe the hype, they warned. Many were considering private schools. All pointed to an unusual desegregation policy, begun in 2000, in which some children from wealthy neighborhoods were bused to schools in poorer areas, and vice versa, to create economically diverse classrooms.
 ''Children from the 450 houses in our subdivision were being bused all across the city,'' said Ms. Wilson, for whom the final affront was a proposal by the Wake County Board of Education to send her two daughters to schools 17 miles from home.
 So she vented her anger at the polls, helping elect four new Republican-backed education board members last fall. Now in the majority, those board members are trying to make good on campaign promises to end Wake's nationally recognized income-based busing policy. 
 At stake is the direction of the 140,000-student school system -- the largest in America to consider family income in school placements. Wake has long been the most prominent example of a district that dropped race-based busing, which courts have ruled unconstitutional, in favor of trying to achieve economic diversity in the schools.
 The board is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to support the creation of ''community assignment zones'' to restrict the distance that students are bused. A new board member has also introduced a resolution to remove the word ''diverse'' from the busing policy and add a clause ''promoting neighborhood schools with proximity to home consideration.''
 Wake's current diversity policy judges family income by the number of students on government lunch programs, setting consequences for any school where at least 40 percent of students require free or reduced-price lunches.
 To create economic diversity, Wake buses students out of their neighborhood zones, in extreme cases an hour away, and uses prestigious magnet schools to lure suburban children to struggling inner-city areas. Smaller cities including Cambridge, Mass., La Crosse, Wis., and St. Lucie County, Fla., have adopted similar economic integration plans.
 But locally, Wake's system is increasingly considered unwieldy and problematic, if not outright unpopular. The four Republican-supported candidates -- running for the only four open seats -- won with an average of 64 percent of the vote. That flipped the board's composition from 8 to 1 in favor of busing to 5 to 4 in opposition.
 ''The stars were in alignment,'' said Claude E. Pope Jr., chairman of the county Republican Party, which spent more than $60,000 on the election, slightly more than Democrats spent. ''You had four good candidates with a really good issue at a time when Republicans needed something to grab hold of.''
 In the aftermath of the vote, supporters of diversity are reeling, hoping to protest their way toward a compromise. The superintendent, Adelphos John Burns, announced his resignation on Feb. 16, saying he could not ''in good conscience'' continue to serve the school system, after 32 years as an educator. The N.A.A.C.P. has threatened legal action and labeled the new board's plan ''resegregation.''
 ''It's a shame -- it got turned into partisan politics,'' said Gary Orfield, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies school busing.
 Both sides marshal their own data to claim that busing has either succeeded or failed.
 Students of all races in Wake continue to outperform state and national averages and have improved on S.A.T. scores and end-of-year tests in recent years, supporters note. There remain significant gaps between races, with 87 percent of white elementary school students performing at or above their grade level in reading, science and math, compared with 48 percent of Hispanics and 46 percent of blacks. But all races made gains over the past school year.
 Across the country, research shows that students of all races and backgrounds perform better in diverse schools, said Roslyn Arlin Mickelson, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Diversified schools typically have higher graduation rates, more college acceptances and fewer students in the criminal justice system, Ms. Mickelson said.
 Some experts say that having middle-class students in a classroom raises the scores of poor students more effectively than increased per-pupil spending, more experienced teachers or lower student-teacher ratios.
 But the new board members cite other statistics: a countywide graduation rate that has fallen over the past five years, rising suspensions and a widening performance gap between poor and wealthy students. They also note that dozens of schools currently exceed the 40 percent subsidized lunch limit with impunity.
 John Tedesco, a newly elected member, said any negative effects of eliminating busing could be offset by increasing financing to impoverished schools. He said the board still valued diversity but thought busing had become an impediment to learning.
 ''We've been playing three-card monte with these kids, shuffling them from school to school,'' he said, ''and we forgot about quality education.''
 North Carolina has a long history of being at the forefront of busing debates, dating to a landmark 1971 Supreme Court decision that race-based busing was an appropriate remedy to segregation in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County.
 In 2007, the court reversed itself in a decision rising out of cases in Seattle and Louisville, Ky., ruling that race could no longer be considered in school assignments. For years, lower courts had been making similar rulings. In 2002, the Charlotte school system eliminated busing for diversification, leading to rapid repolarization of schools by race and income.
 ''My feeling is that it's very important for people in Wake to drive over to Charlotte and see what's happened,'' said Mr. Orfield of U.C.L.A.
 Wake's diversity requirement is hardly its only controversial education policy. The county, which is affluent and Democratic compared with the rest of the state, has experimented with several unusual tactics in recent years.
 They included a ''year round'' calendar system to maximize classroom space by scheduling different school days for different groups of students, replacing traditional summer vacations with shorter, more frequent breaks. There was also a policy of dismissing students an hour early on Wednesdays to allow teacher planning meetings, which critics dubbed ''Wacky Wednesdays'' and said forced families to hire babysitters.
 The newly elected board has taken quick action, including voting to end early Wednesday dismissals.
 After a heated board meeting on Wednesday, a new member who opposes the diversity busing plan, Debra Goldman, said she hoped the two factions could find common ground. ''We could go back and forth for the next several years,'' she said. ''But let's try to come up with something that works.''
 That has not assuaged Sam Haney, a black parent, who stood up at a recent community meeting and announced that Wake could appear to be ''a racist school system'' if it got rid of busing. Mr. Haney's son will start kindergarten next fall, and he worries about preparing him for an increasingly diverse world.
 ''Why would we want the black students in an all-black school?'' he said. ''The world just doesn't look like that anymore.''

HEADLINE: Frustrated Generation Wages Jihad on Pakistan

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and WAQAR GILLANI

 BODY:
LAHORE, Pakistan -- Umar Kundi was his parents' pride, an ambitious young man from a small town who made it to medical school in the big city. It seemed like a story of working-class success, living proof in this unequal society that a telephone operator's son could become a doctor.
 But things went wrong along the way. On campus Mr. Kundi fell in with a hard-line Islamic group. His degree did not get him a job, and he drifted in the urban crush of young people looking for work. His early radicalization helped channel his ambitions in a grander, more sinister way. 
 Instead of healing the sick, Mr. Kundi went on to become one of Pakistan's most accomplished militants. Working under a handler from Al Qaeda, he was part of a network that carried out some of the boldest attacks against the Pakistani state and its people last year, the police here say. Months of hunting him ended on Feb. 19, when he was killed in a shootout with the police at the age of 29. 
 Mr. Kundi and members of his circle -- educated strivers who come from the lower middle class -- are part of a new generation that has made militant networks in Pakistan more sophisticated and deadly. Al Qaeda has harnessed their aimless ambition and anger at Pakistan's alliance with the United States, their generation's most electrifying enemy. 
 ''These are guys who use Google Maps to plan their attacks,'' said a senior Punjab Province police official. ''Their training is better than our national police academy.''
 Like Mr. Kundi, many came of age in the 1990s, when jihad was state policy -- aimed at challenging Indian control in Kashmir -- and jihadi groups recruited openly in universities. Under the influence of Al Qaeda, their energies have been redirected and turned inward, against Pakistan's own government and people. 
 That shift has fractured long-established militant networks, which were once supported by the state, producing a patchwork of new associations that are fluid and defy easy categorization.
 ''The situation now is quite confusing,'' said Tariq Parvez, director of the National Counterterrorism Authority in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. ''We can no longer talk in terms of organizations. Now it's a question of like-minded militants.'' 
 The result has been deadly. In 2009, militant attacks killed 3,021 Pakistanis, three times as many as in 2006.
 The issue is urgent. Pakistan is in the midst of a youth bulge, with more than a million people a year pouring into the job market, and the economy -- at its current rate -- is not growing fast enough to absorb them. Only a tiny fraction choose militancy, but acute joblessness exacerbates the risk. 
 A Student's Education
 Mr. Kundi's journey and the ways he veered off course parallel Pakistan's own recent history. Born to Pashtun parents, he grew up in a small town in southwestern Punjab, where camels lumber in slow clumps, and sand stings the eyes. His father's monthly income of $255 put them at the lower edge of Pakistan's middle class. But life still took patience. Meat was a luxury. His father could afford to visit him in medical school only once.
 He brought that past -- part shyness, part shame -- with him to college in Faisalabad, the third-biggest city in Pakistan. The city was an explosion of things modern. Traffic jams. Fancy restaurants. Uncovered women. For young people from small towns, unfamiliar with city life, the atmosphere can arouse a rigid defensiveness, said Mughees-uddin Sheikh, a dean at the University of the Punjab in Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city. 
 ''The student is tempted, but he doesn't understand it because he wasn't educated,'' said Mr. Sheikh. ''He's been deprived of things like this.''
 To ease the adjustment, young people join student groups, which, like powerful inner-city gangs, help them navigate life -- how to use a bank, which mosque to pray in -- but also offer protection. 
 When Mr. Kundi arrived at Punjab Medical College in the late 1990s, he chose a group with an Islamic focus, according to a classmate and friend, Muhammad, who asked that his last name not be used because he feared association with a militant. It was a typical choice for students from devout families, who want their sons to stay out of trouble in the city.
 The group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, ran charities and prayer meetings. It also offered training for jihad in Kashmir. Lashkar's blend of adventure and patriotism appealed to restless young men. It even had an office on campus: Room 12D.
 Such jihadi groups had become part of mainstream society in Pakistan in the 1980s, when the United States was financing Islamic radicals fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, and when an American-supported Pakistani general, Muhammad Zia ul-Haq, empowered hard-line mullahs and injected Islam into school textbooks. 
 By the 1990s, recruiters for jihad in Kashmir were holding rallies on public university campuses. After 2001, Lashkar was driven underground, but it continues to operate through a charity wing. American, Indian and Pakistani officials say it carried out the attacks on hotels and other landmarks in Mumbai, India, in November 2008. 
 It is the lower middle class in Pakistan that is most vulnerable to radicalization, according to Amir Rana, director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies. They consume virulently anti-American media. They are recruited aggressively by Islamic student groups in public universities, which are attended almost exclusively by lower- and middle-class youth. 
 ''They're politically conscious, but it's not mature,'' Mr. Rana said. ''They have big problems, but when they try to solve them, they get confused.''
 Mr. Kundi threw himself into Lashkar's activities, working summers at an eye clinic in Kashmir, his friend Muhammad said. He held Koran-reading sessions. He developed a close relationship with the group's spiritual leader, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. Mr. Kundi was a skilled recruiter, even winning over a secular classmate whose family lived in Canada.
 ''He had logic for every single point,'' Muhammad said. ''He could convince anyone.''
 Despite his zeal for jihad, it was a relatively quiet time in Pakistan. The war against the Soviets was long over, and most of the country's jihadi groups were drifting. All that changed when the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, jolting young Pakistani jihadis who saw it as a war against Muslims.
 ''That was the beginning,'' said a security official in Karachi. ''They went from small local targets, to a much bigger global one, the United States.''
 When Al Qaeda came to Pakistan, Mr. Kundi did not have to go far to find it. The American invasion had pushed many of its leaders over the border, including Abu Zubaydah, a member of Osama bin Laden's inner circle. In 2002, he surfaced in Allied Hospital in Faisalabad, where Mr. Kundi was working. He was seeking treatment and preaching against Pakistan's government for supporting the United States. His audience loved it, Muhammad said.
 ''Every doctor at the hospital was against the government,'' he said. ''They saw Abu Zubaydah as the hero of Muslims.''
 Lashkar's activities now seemed small, and embarrassingly pro-government. Mr. Kundi began to argue with Mr. Saeed, the group's leader, picking fights with him in public about Lashkar's mission. The United States, he argued, was killing Muslims, and Lashkar was doing nothing for them. 
 In a stinging insult, Muhammad recalled, Mr. Kundi began calling Mr. Saeed ''the B team of the government,'' a reference to the group's not-so-secret connection to the state. 
 His frustration coincided with a bitter discovery. His father, who had retired, could not pay for schooling beyond Mr. Kundi's basic medical degree. A pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia and a family wedding had sapped the family's savings, Mr. Kundi's father, Dilawar, said in an interview. Without a specialization, Mr. Kundi faced a salary at a public hospital of less than $100 a month, too low to support a wife and children, a humiliating prospect.
 '' 'I've earned a degree, but I'm a zero,' '' Muhammad recalled him saying. 
 His father begged him to return and open a practice in their hometown. Mr. Kundi refused.
 It was 2005, the year he disappeared.
 Life as a Militant
 Conventional theory on militant organizations says that groups have hierarchies, members and sometimes territory. But in Pakistan after Sept. 11, 2001, those lines blurred. Of the half a dozen groups that were active in Punjab in the 1990s, many had splintered by the middle of the next decade, divided by differences over, among other things, whether jihad required attacking the Pakistani state.
 Now, most acts of terrorism are carried out by loose associations of individual militants, making militancy more fluid.
 ''It's more about networks than formal organizations now,'' said an American defense official who studies the issue. ''Their attacks are focused on aspects of the state in a way they haven't been ever before.''
 While the Pakistani Taliban have captured imaginations and headlines, many law enforcement officials say they believe that militancy in Pakistan is much more diffuse.
 According to the police investigation, Mr. Kundi was one of eight jihadis under a man named Sheik Issa al-Masri, Arabic for ''the Egyptian.'' Most were born around 1980 and had come to jihad after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 They moved between cities in Punjab and Waziristan, an area near the Afghan border where militants from Al Qaeda, the Taliban and other groups have set up bases.
 They came together for attacks -- on the Lahore office of Pakistan's spy agency, on two police training academies and on the Sri Lankan cricket team -- but more often for crimes to pay for their militant activities. 
 In Faisalabad, Mr. Kundi extorted a textile mill owner. In Lahore, his friend Asif Mehmoud stole cars. According to a police interrogation of Mr. Mehmoud, one kidnapping that brought $60,000 was split among themselves and Sheik Issa.
 In an indication of how fluid their lives were, Mr. Mehmoud, a graduate of Lahore's most prestigious engineering university, also held a string of ordinary jobs, as a repairman for textile equipment, a welding instructor in a cutlery institute, a worker in a call center. His resume lists two hobbies: cooking and current affairs.
 Sheik Issa, who is on the United States' most-wanted list, provided the early intellectual justification for attacking Pakistan, a development the American defense official described as ''very significant.'' It was a common approach for Al Qaeda in other Muslim countries, but a sharp departure for Pakistan, whose militants had fought Soviets, Indians in Kashmir and Pakistani Shiites, but had never gone all-out against the state itself. 
 ''Sheik Issa said the Pakistani Army has become the well-wisher of America,'' stated a police interrogation report, citing a 29-year-old member of the network arrested last year. ''It's mandatory that we should give maximum losses to the agencies of Pakistan. This is also jihad.''
 Their strikes were skillful. In last year's attack against the Sri Lankan cricket team, led by another educated young man from a working-class family, a 29-year-old nursing assistant, Aqeel Ahmed, only three top people out of about 14 attackers knew the nature of the target, according to a police official who investigated the attack. The rest believed that the bus they were ambushing held an American delegation. 
 Their plans were ambitious. A computer memory stick found on a militant linked to Mr. Ahmed and killed last fall in a shootout with the police in the southern Punjab town of Dera Ghazi Khan contained plans to destroy bridges and railroads and to strike at the heart of the Pakistani state, its military. The language was in code: ''Lentils'' meant aluminum paste. ''Wheat'' was fertilizer.
 ''GHQ is an important task -- do it immediately,'' said the voice on the memory stick, referring to the military's headquarters. ''Don't wait.''
 A Powerful Addiction
 When the attack on the army headquarters unfolded last October, Mr. Ahmed, the nursing assistant, was at the center of it. His father, Nazir, watched it on television. A photograph of his son's face flashed on the screen. It was the first glimpse he had had of his boy since he disappeared in 2007. He froze, overcome with shock and shame. ''My muscles were not with me,'' Mr. Ahmed said in an interview in November.
 Since then, a question has tormented him. His son earned A's in high school, had a decent salary in a military hospital and received spending money from an uncle in Canada. How could he have gone so wrong? 
 A Pakistani military psychiatrist is trying to answer that question. In a study of 24 young men who were involved in terrorist attacks in Pakistan, the psychiatrist, Brig. Mowadat Hussain Rana, has found that they tend to be the younger or middle siblings in families of six or more children. The households are not always poor but are often violent, and the youngsters get lost in the chaos. 
 ''He's that boy who is not in a rigorous system of rule setting,'' Brigadier Rana said in an interview in Rawalpindi. ''He becomes someone who drifts, who spends afternoons hitting stray dogs, and no one notices.''
 His parents, at their wits' end, take him to a mullah, hoping to instill discipline, the theory goes. The two develop a close relationship, sometimes even sexual, giving the boy the attention he has long craved. The mullah then introduces him to others, men who make him feel important, as if he is part of something bigger than himself. 
 Of the 24 militants in the study, about a third attended college, though not all graduated. 
 But socio-economic theories explain only so much. For Mr. Kundi, an emotional young man with thwarted ambitions, militancy had a psychological pull. Mr. Parvez of the National Counterterrorism Authority said militants he had interviewed called jihad an addiction, a habit that made them feel powerful in a world that ignored them.
 ''Out there I'm a useless guy, unemployed and cursed by my family,'' one militant said. ''Here I'm a commander. My words have weight.''
 The police in Punjab Province arrested about seven young militants last year who they say were connected to Mr. Kundi, weakening two groups, they said. 
 Since then, attacks in Pakistan's main cities have dropped sharply. But militants' capacity for regeneration has surprised the authorities before, and a deeper fix would be tackling some of Pakistan's social problems, which the country's political elite, preoccupied by power struggles, has ignored.
 The last time Muhammad saw Mr. Kundi they were sitting together on a bench outside Allied Hospital in Faisalabad. A scruffy old man walked by, hunched over a cane. The man's death, Mr. Kundi said, would be unimportant. His own, in contrast, would have meaning.
 But did it? Muhammad disapproved of Mr. Kundi's choice, because it led to the deaths of hundreds of innocent people. But he understood it. Mr. Kundi wanted badly to be important. Now, in a way, he is.
 ''He applied his mind,'' Muhammad said. ''He took what society offered.''

HEADLINE: At the Whitney, Busting Out Quietly

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
''IT'S a lot cheaper to get a new wig than a new wife,'' the art collector Mera Rubell said at the gala on Tuesday for the opening of the Whitney Biennial. Peering out from beneath a spiky platinum Warhol wig, the dark-haired Ms. Rubell gazed up at her husband, Don, a former obstetrician turned art mogul, and added that she had another look for the after-party. 
 Did her next wig resemble the synthetic page boys worn by Amsterdam prostitutes in the Marlene Dumas paintings that the Rubells collect? Maybe it did and maybe not. Ms. Rubell was keeping mum. After all, you don't build a controversial real estate empire and one of the more important contemporary art collections in the country by giving away the goods. 
 But she did say this: Among the many artists at what some people term a love-to-hate-it biennial, the one to watch was Thomas Houseago, a Briton who lives and works in Los Angeles. ''Houseago is busting it out in sculpture right now,'' Ms. Rubell said. 
 If the Whitney Biennial has long been a place to uncover artists who are busting things out in terms of aesthetics (and soon enough at the cash register), the biennial party has a reputation for doing the same thing socially. 
 Unlike a lot of evening-hours events in New York, the biennial party has traditionally provided an unlikely mash-up: Park Avenue meets Williamsburg; Balenciaga-bag types mingle with people who look like they sleep in their clothes; billionaires rub shoulders with artists who squat in Bushwick hovels with drafty windows and no boiler. 
 Yet somehow this year, the biennial felt tamer than past efforts, despite the co-curator Gary Carrion-Murayari's assertion that they had gone looking ''for work with active political and social content'' to shake up the museum. 
 That quieter tone -- is it the economy, the state of war or just art fatigue? -- was mirrored in the mood of a wingding that was more sedate than the raucous beer blasts of times past. 
 Yes, there was music, Billie Holiday remixed by the D.J. shErOck with plenty of bass. And, of course, there was free-flowing beer and Bear Flag wine. But it said something about the distance that has developed in this town between high society and high bohemia that Aerin Lauder, the cosmetics heir and Whitney supporter, was seen dashing from the museum even before the doors opened to the hoi polloi partygoers lined up around Madison Avenue onto 75th Street in a steady rain.
 Like many of the museum's benefactors, Ms. Lauder had already seen the biennial, at a V.I.P. party hosted at the museum by Sotheby's. There was a time when people of her ilk might have found it fun to stick around for the art scrum. But that era ended back when people like the Rubells could still pick up Cindy Sherman photos for $25 (one of those pictures later resold at auction for $250,000).
 Now patrons can encounter artists anytime, usually at one of the proliferating art fairs where painters and sculptors are served up along with the hors d'oeuvres.
 ''Taxi!'' Ms. Lauder called out, darting from the museum at 6:45, as the first revelers made their way through the door.
 Did she miss much? Well, that would depend on how one feels about watching tipsy art lovers take in work like the installation by the artist Aki Sasamoto, whose current obsessions, the artist said, include ''doughnuts, fortune tellers and hemorrhoids.'' 
 It depends on whether one is as disaffected as the members of the anonymous art collective Bruce High Quality Foundation claim to be with the current state of America. 
 ''Water under the bridge,'' a recorded female voice intoned from somewhere in the chassis of a Cadillac Miller-Meteor hearse, part of the Foundation's installation, one of the certified hits of the show. ''We're over America and America is over us,'' the voice continued. But one doubts it. 
 Who could sincerely be ''over'' an America that includes Justin Bond, the singer who performs as a boozy and politically pointed chanteuse called Kiki, and who came to the Whitney party wearing deep red lipstick and a hat reminiscent of Robin Hood's cap? 
 ''I still can't believe I performed with Yoko Ono,'' said Mr. Bond, who appeared just over a week ago at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the Plastic Ono Band. 
 Andy Warhol always used to complain that nobody gets work at parties and then went out every night of his life. Odds are that, were Warhol alive, he would have been at the Whitney, posturing alongside all the Children of Warhol, folks like Rufus Wainwright (in a logger's cap) or Jeffrey Deitch, the new head of the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (in his signature bug glasses) and the actress Leelee Sobieski (in an evening dress and hiking boots) with her partner, the bearded men's-wear designer Adam Kimmel, and the photographer Ari Marcopoulos, a biennial artist (who spared fellow partygoers any doubt about his identity by wearing his name stenciled on his jacket) and about a thousand others not about to be deterred by freezing drizzle.
 As the party began, the artist Martin Kersels climbed stairs to the top of his sculpture ''Speaker Song'' (microphones, speakers, aluminum and beaded curtains) and announced that he would remain there for the rest of the evening. His leg in a medical brace, he was stuck.
 ''Now that I'm up, I can't get down,'' Mr. Kersels said. And it is safe to add that, for some at the biennial party, the reverse would soon be true.

HEADLINE: States Move to Revoke Charities' Tax Exemptions

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Faced with steep declines in tax revenue, an increasing number of states and localities are considering eliminating various tax exemptions for nonprofit groups.
 A bill before the Hawaii Legislature, for instance, would require charities to pay a 1 percent tax, and Kansas is considering making them subject to sales taxes.
 Revoking the nonprofit organizations' exemptions from property taxes is also under scrutiny in several counties in Kansas, as well as in Pennsylvania. 
 And last fall, Minneapolis made charities subject to the fees it charges businesses and residents for streetlights in hope of gaining an additional $155,000, an exercise Jon Pratt, executive director of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, describes as ''looking under the sofa cushions.''
 In most cases, churches would be exempt from the tax measures, but all other nonprofit groups, including private schools and colleges, would be affected.
 City and state officials say they have no choice. 
 ''We're having to look at the public services nonprofits use and how we can adequately cover those costs,'' said Matt Greller, executive director of the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns. ''We can't give them away for free any longer.''
 Nonprofit groups say the moves to wring revenue out of them are shortsighted and will produce cutbacks in critical services that governments rely on them to provide, like mental health and emergency foster care services.
 ''Nonprofits are really hurting in this economy,'' said Tim Delaney, chief executive of the National Council of Nonprofits, a trade association. ''Their revenues are down, too, and demand for the services they provide, services that government expects them to provide, is way up.''
 State and local governments have tried rolling back various nonprofit tax exemptions in the past, with limited success. Some localities have negotiated ''payments in lieu of taxes'' from some nonprofit groups. Harvard, for example, paid the City of Cambridge $2.2 million in 2008, as well as $5.2 million for water and sewer service, though such arrangements are typically temporary and subject to negotiation.
 But exemptions from property, sales and other taxes have largely remained sacrosanct -- until now. 
 ''Our members are beyond upset, they're fearful,'' said Diana Aviv, chief executive of the Independent Sector, a nonprofit trade group. ''They know that state elected officials are short of cash and are looking for every opportunity -- and, frankly, excuse -- to raid pots of money to pay for other pressing needs.''
 Ms. Aviv and other charity leaders contend that charities are already helping government defray costs because so many states and localities are long past due on payments owed to nonprofit groups for services that governments used to provide. 
 ''We're effectively providing interest-free loans to state governments, which have been very slow to pay what they owe us, and now they're asking us to pay more,'' said Lisa Maruyama, chief executive of the Hawaii Alliance of Nonprofit Organizations.
 Hawaii is considering suspending a wide range of exemptions from the general excise tax, including the one held by nonprofit organizations. Additionally, the Honolulu City Council is talking about increasing the property tax on the groups, which is currently capped at $100 a year.
 Calvin K. Y. Say, the speaker of the Hawaii House of Representatives and a supporter of revoking exemptions, emphasized that he was not singling out nonprofit groups. 
 ''They would be one of many others that would lose various exemptions,'' Mr. Say said. ''Repealing exemptions spreads the pain more evenly than raising the rate paid by those already subject to excise taxes.''
 He said his proposal could raise $500 million to $750 million, which would help close a budget shortfall of $1.2 billion as of January. ''I've tried this before, and I've always gotten criticism for it,'' Mr. Say said. ''But in this environment today, all options are being considered much more seriously.''
 Mr. Greller, of the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns, said mayors and other elected officials have to consider all their options. A proposal to cap the amount of property taxes paid by Indiana residents is on the ballot in November, and if it passes, local government revenues across the state will fall by hundreds of millions of dollars, he said.
 Indiana's localities are considering user fees for things like police and fire services that would affect large, wealthy nonprofit organizations like universities and hospitals the most. Already, Ball State University pays a small fee to the City of Muncie for fire protection, and Indiana University pays a similar fee to Bloomington, Mr. Greller said. 
 He said that in the majority of Indiana's localities, at least half of the property is tax-exempt because it is owned by a charity.
 The increasing amount of property owned by the University of Pittsburgh's medical center and other nonprofit groups in Pittsburgh and elsewhere prompted State Senator Wayne D. Fontana to propose legislation that would impose an ''essential services'' fee on charities, based on the amount of property they own. 
 ''In Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, we have a lot of nonprofits continually buying up real estate and expanding and getting bigger and bigger,'' Mr. Fontana said. ''Each piece of property they buy becomes untaxable, which means everyone else has to pay more in property taxes just to maintain service levels.''
 In December, Mayor Luke Ravenstahl of Pittsburgh proposed a 1 percent tax on college tuitions to raise roughly $16 million that would help the city make pension payments. He shelved the plan when three large nonprofit organizations in the city -- the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Highmark, a health care provider -- agreed to make larger voluntary payments.
 Michael D. Weekes, chief executive of Providers Council, a trade association representing organizations that provide human services in Massachusetts, said that more and more cities and towns in that state were pressing nonprofit groups to make similar agreements. 
 ''Those may seem less onerous than what other places are considering,'' Mr. Weekes said, ''but the bottom line is, they still cut into our ability to deliver vital services.''

HEADLINE: For a Moment of Glory, Mastering a Million Details

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
NORWICH, Vt.
 Mapping out the motorcade route. Check.
 Arranging for a police escort. Check.
 Asking Marty Candon to chauffeur the homecoming dignitary in Ms. Candon's red Volkswagen convertible. Check.
 Corralling a welcoming party of 300 elementary school students. Baking hundreds of cupcakes. Finding two plastic kiddie pools in the back of Dan & Whit's general store, cupping them together, and painting them gold to create a huge Olympic medallion.
 Buying 200 miniature American flags that normally sell for 79 cents apiece at a hardware store across the river, but these are for Hannah, anything for Hannah, so let's say 49 cents each.
 Check, check, check and check. 
 Two weeks ago, on a slushy night on the other side of the continent, an American freestyle skier named Hannah Kearney zigged and zagged down a rutted slope, did a flip, zagged some more and then launched herself again to perform a helicopter turn. She seemed to float in the Vancouver air.
 Ms. Kearney returned to earth to win the gold medal in women's mogul skiing, the first for the United States in this year's Winter Olympics and the first ever for her hometown of Norwich, where cheers disrupted the hush of that February night.
 A gold medal does not ease the recession, or bring the troops home, or dry the tears from quake-shaken Haiti. It will not end the small-town political quarrels here in Norwich, where argument, for some, is a form of aerobic exercise. It cannot reverse time to the moments before another Olympic hopeful from Norwich, the gifted snowboarder Kevin Pearce, suffered a brain injury while training on New Year's Eve.
 But a gold medal -- or, better yet, a young woman who has won a gold medal -- provides her proud Vermont town with a reason to pause and freshly consider the hoary lessons about hope, and resolve, and what is meant by community. 
 So when a few people asked whether anyone was interested in throwing Hannah a homecoming party, the answer was yes -- times 3,500, the town's population. Yes to the ''Congratulations, Hannah'' posters planted in the sidewalk snow. Yes to the yellow sweatshirt reserved for Hannah and laid out for people to sign at Dan & Whit's, the nerve center of Norwich. Yes to the addition of sweat pants once the sweatshirt ran out of room for signatures. Yes.
 Norwich is a small but Olympian town, having dispatched nearly a dozen athletes to the Winter Games over the last half-century. Send-off ceremonies are so common that when Marty Candon's son was young, he just assumed that every American town sent a representative to the Olympics.
 Hannah received her send-off last month from the town green's new bandstand, the construction of which had been good for about a year's worth of squabbling. She left with a plastic bag containing the cheers of students from the town's elementary school, her alma mater, across the green.
 The next thing Norwich knew was: Hannah did it. Hannah, who lives down the main road; who must have started skiing when she was in the womb; whose mix of decency and determination was displayed in Wendy Thompson's third-grade class, in Tracy Smith's art class, in everything she did around town. She now wears gold; those bagged cheers had worked.
 The Norwich Recreation Council soon announced plans for a homecoming on the town's Internet community board, used by moneyed retirees, muck-covered farmers and middle-class Janes and Johns. So many people offered to help that Aimee Goodwin, the event's food coordinator, had too many offers to bake goodies, but did not have the heart to turn any of them down.
 By Thursday, the day before The Day, much had come together, yet much hinged on the weather. What if the approaching winter storm meant no school? What if it rained hard enough to wash the kindergartners from the town green? What if Hannah's evening flight was canceled?
 In the Town Hall, Jill Kearney, Hannah's mother and the town's recreation director, fidgeted with excitement. Her office, festooned with boxes of baseballs and stacks of plastic soccer cones, was now decorated in 21st Century Olympian, with photographs of Hannah on the walls and a U.S.A. Olympic jacket hanging from a hook. All of it hard-earned.
 Hannah's travails are well known here: the disappointing performance in the 2006 Olympics; the subsequent knee surgery; the concussion that ended an imperfect back flip, giving the Kearney family only the smallest sense of what the Pearce family is going through, as their Kevin works toward recovery. 
 All the while, Hannah kept coming back, coming back -- and now she was coming back to Norwich.
 On Thursday night, as rain fell and the wind whipped, some volunteers collected the kiddie-pool medallion from Ms. Smith's art room and draped it over the bandstand. Meanwhile, some homecoming volunteers discussed last-minute details in the Town Hall, where, the night before, a meeting of the Selectboard, or town council, was canceled because it could not muster a quorum -- thanks to another brewing quarrel.
 But this was a night for planning a celebration, not settling a score. 
 ''Should we start with the weather?'' asked Chris Healy, the lead coordinator and a father of three. ''Most people are saying we can handle it.''
 ''She won it in pouring rain,'' answered Pete Webster, the town manager. ''It would be fitting.''
 The volunteers moved on to other matters. The motorcade stops that would first be made in Hanover, N.H., across the river, where Hannah attended middle and high school. The reserved parking for the governor. The delivery of the custom-made cakes from Ben & Jerry's, because The Day was also Hannah's 24th birthday.
 Check, check, check.
 Through the night, the gusting wind pounded against Dan & Whit's general store, the Norwich Inn and the lightweight kiddie-pool medallion dangling from the bandstand. But Friday morning arrived dry and sporadically sunny, although Ms. Smith had to take the medallion down to bang out dents and do some touch-ups with gold spray paint.
 By noon the town's bandstand, once a symbol of contention, had become a buzzing hive of anticipation. Two men tested the sound system, while a woman ventured up a ladder to hang an American flag. A Lion's Club member looked for an appropriate place to display another ''Congratulations, Hannah'' sign. Three sixth-grade girls -- Lilly, Kelly and Emily -- practiced a trumpet fanfare that included strains to what has become the Olympic anthem, Leo Arnaud's ''Bugler's Dream.''
 By 1:45, the kiddie-pool medallion was back in place. Phil Dechert, the town planner, was standing guard on Main Street, making sure no one parked in that space for the governor. On the green, two signs dedicated specifically to Kevin Pearce -- ''You're an Olympic hero in our hearts'' -- were on prominent display.
 Then word rippled through the crowd: Hannah's motorcade had left Hanover. Soon there came the sirens of her police escort, followed by a spot of red in the distance: Marty Candon's convertible. Sitting high in the passenger seat, waving with her right hand and holding aloft a chunk of gold with her left, was the birthday girl.
 She climbed out of the car and walked toward the bandstand, amid chants of ''Hannah!'' and ''U.S.A.'' She slapped high-fives with dozens of students, took photographs of people taking her photograph, and paused to hug Ms. Thompson, her third-grade teacher.
 There would be speeches. But first Hannah Kearney, along with the hundreds gathered on the slushy town green, paused to hear three sixth-grade girls with trumpets play music that seems to demand the best of us.

HEADLINE: A Hummer Even Naysayers Can Like

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
ON Wednesday, General Motors announced that the planned sale of its Hummer brand to an obscure Chinese manufacturing company had fallen through and that the division would cease operations.
 As if to punctuate Hummer's demise, Jeremy Dean, a New York artist, is rolling out a work based on a Hummer H2. The gas-guzzling engine has been removed, and the S.U.V. can be pulled by horses. 
 Mr. Dean calls the piece ''Back to the Futurama,'' a reference to the film ''Back to the Future'' and the G.M. Futurama exhibition at the 1939 World's Fair. Mr. Dean plans to unveil the piece on Sunday in Central Park when he hitches the vehicle to two white horses. After that, the piece will be on display at the Pulse art fair in New York, which runs from from Thursday through Sunday.
 Mr. Dean said on his blog that he was interested in exploring ''contemporary issues by deconstructing and recontextualizing iconic symbols to gain perspective and understanding about the world in which we live.''
 He said he bought the Hummer in Orlando for $15,000 and worked with Slick's Garage in Palmetto, Fla., to modify it. He removed the engine and turned the hood and grille upside down, then cleverly reinstalled them to form an elevated coachman's seat. Mr. Dean said the vehicle retained its chrome rims, navigation system and DVD player.
 The piece is a protest against an unsustainable lifestyle and a rolling reminder of what could happen when the oil runs out, or ''a monument to America's consumption, greed and arrogance,'' he says on his blog.
 ''I am making my own satirical prediction of the future,'' he explained. ''Unless we come up with alternative fuel sources and rethink our reliance on a hyperinflated consumption-based economy; we may be left with no other options than to hook our cars up to a horse.'' PHIL PATTON

HEADLINE: A Senator's Frustration With a Partisan Congress

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Why I'm Leaving the Senate'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 21):
 Evan Bayh's rationale for leaving the Senate makes absolutely no sense. He spends most of his Op-Ed article setting forth a series of remedies for the dysfunctional state of the Congress. Why then is he not willing to work to bring about the reforms he recommends? 
 Senator Bayh has been granted the honor of serving in one of the most important positions in the nation. He has an obligation not to quit and thereby reduce the chance of advancing reform.
 His essay is not an explanation but a cop-out. 
 G. Oliver Koppell New York City Council Member Bronx, Feb. 21, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I am unconvinced by Senator Evan Bayh's argument regarding Congressional dysfunction.
 In 2001, having just won a controversial election and presiding over an evenly divided Senate, President George W. Bush was nonetheless able to enact the centerpiece of his economic agenda, the largest and costliest tax cut in history. Throughout his tenure, despite minorities or small majorities in the Senate, Mr. Bush successfully pushed through highly controversial legislation, including authorization of the war in Iraq, No Child Left Behind, bank bailouts and Medicare drug coverage.
 Given Mr. Bush's success, I conclude that the real problem in Congress is not institutional. The problem is with the Democratic Party. In a small but telling example, a recent vote on President Obama's nominee for a National Labor Relations Board position failed to override a threatened Republican filibuster. Amazingly, two Democratic senators, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, joined Republicans planning to filibuster the confirmation.
 Until Democratic leaders are willing to stand up against this sort of behavior within their own party, they will never be able to enact their legislative priorities.
 David J. Kinyon Minneapolis, Feb. 21, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I understand Senator Evan Bayh's position all too well -- desperately seeking a middle ground in an environment where ''no compromise'' is the theme. Sadly, the divide may be common in Americans' daily lives as well.
 My husband and his best friend of over 30 years have not spoken since the 2008 elections. My husband, a moderate liberal, and his friend, a staunch conservative, have become such political adversaries that they can't surmount the differences that were once the most exhilarating part of lively dinner conversations and backyard debates.
 As the person caught in the middle, both personally and as a citizen, I beg Washington to realize that action, not inaction, will make American lives better.

HEADLINE: The Accidental Lieutenant

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Albany
 SOMEWHERE in the bowels of the Budget Division, under harsh light, a dozen graying men sat around a table for two hours staring at charts of the state's rising debt burden, a tale of looming disaster in deceptively cheerful colors. In the middle, Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch had three paper cups of water lined up in front of him. He had forgotten his jacket in somebody's office, and his jutting gut was all but bursting out of his white shirt.
Mr. Ravitch, 76, had been running at full throttle for nine hours, and would be at it for six more. But if he occasionally closed his eyes, it was only to think up another question nobody saw coming, or pose another remedy for New York State's financial ills that made so much sense even he would admit it could never fly.
 ''Wall Street lives off these local issuers, and they make obscene spreads,'' he said, cutting someone off to lay out an idea for eliminating costly underwriting fees by consolidating bond issuance by cities and towns at the state level. ''If we reduce local assistance by the amount we pay in debt service and we pay lower debt service. ... Is that worth looking at?'' 
 Eyebrows arched; bodies shifted in their seats. Many oxen would be gored if this went through: for as long as anyone could remember, financiers and lawyers have traded campaign contributions with the power players in both parties who dole out those lucrative underwriting assignments.
 Such taboo-breaking suggestions are Mr. Ravitch's signature, part of his process. As when he asked what prevented the state from filing for bankruptcy protection. Or what would happen if New York's problems got so bad that no one -- no one -- ran for governor. ''He's the most uninhibited person I think I've ever met,'' said Robert Megna, the state budget director. 
 With the accidental governor who appointed him last summer having announced on Friday under a cloud of scandal that he would not seek a full term, Mr. Ravitch may now finally emerge from basement powwows and academic discussions of pie-in-the-sky possibilities to actually wield some power. He is widely seen as the only adult left in Albany, and many Democratic leaders throughout the state are calling on Gov. David A. Paterson to hand control of budget negotiations to his second. 
 As calls mounted late last week for the governor to resign over his intervention in a domestic violence case involving a top aide, Mr. Ravitch hunkered down in his Manhattan office, ducking calls from reporters and politely fielding legislators' offers of help should Mr. Paterson pack it in. Aides said he had not heard from Mr. Paterson before the Friday news conference in which he abandoned his campaign. With decades behind him of swooping into city and state institutions at their worst hours, Mr. Ravitch has practically perfected the role of Mr. Fix-It. Perhaps his biggest qualification now, as lieutenant governor, is his lack of ambition.
 ''My disability is my strength,'' Mr. Ravitch said at one upbeat moment during several days of meetings and conversations earlier this month. ''I'm not a candidate for anything.''
 A THROWBACK to a time when wise men ruled New York -- bankers like David Rockefeller, financiers like Felix Rohatyn, labor bosses like Albert Shanker -- Mr. Ravitch has been a fixture for half a century in liberal politics, real estate and Jewish philanthropy, not to mention the pages of the city's newspapers. As head of his family's construction company, he built Waterside Plaza and Manhattan Plaza. As a confidant of Gov. Hugh L. Carey, he rescued the state's Urban Development Corporation from bankruptcy and helped the city avoid default. 
 Mayor Edward I. Koch dubbed him a Cassandra in the 1970s, but Mr. Ravitch was seldom ignored. As chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in the 1980s, he plugged deficits, updated the subway fleet, created the Metro-North Railroad and survived strikes and assassination attempts. He quit after clashing with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, but never faded away, leading the city's Charter Revision Commission, negotiating for Major League Baseball's owners, buying and selling the Bowery Savings Bank.
 His one bid for office resulted in a third-place finish in the Democratic mayoral primary in 1989. Aides remembered him as a horrendous candidate, always saying something impolitic when he wasn't grossing people out by picking his ears. ''We all said he'd make a great city manager,'' recalled Cindy Darrison, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who got her start as his scheduler on that disastrous campaign.
 When tapping him as lieutenant governor last July, Governor Paterson said he needed Mr. Ravitch -- who a few months earlier had brokered a complex deal for a new payroll tax to avoid M.T.A. cuts and fare hikes -- to oversee the state's response to the growing fiscal crisis. But Mr. Paterson did not put him in charge of anything beyond coming up with a four-year fiscal plan.
 Untaxed by that task -- Mr. Ravitch plans to submit his report next week -- he found other things to do. He reprised his role as Prophet of Doom, warning civic groups and haranguing newspaper editors to report that the crisis was worse than people thought and would only deepen when the Obama administration's stimulus money ran out. He raised the alarm when federal health care legislation threatened to cost New York nearly $1 billion. He drew national attention to state deficits, writing opinion articles calling on the federal government to pick up a greater share of Medicaid costs and pressing labor unions to put their lobbying muscle behind the idea.
 ''Nobody's going to listen to me, but health care is putting them out of business,'' he said of the unions. ''Every state's cutting back on infrastructure. Medicaid is squeezing out all the other expenses.''
 With no one telling him not to, Mr. Ravitch, who does not take a salary, reached out to help St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan avert bankruptcy (but failed); haggled endlessly (and unsuccessfully) with the city, unions and lawmakers to lift the cap on the number of charter schools so New York could qualify for up to $700 million in new federal education aid; and tried to get the state to help the city finance 20,000 public housing units (still pending).
 One afternoon when nothing was going right, his cellphone rang. It was a member of his family. (Mr. Ravitch, on his third marriage, laments being unable to spend much time with his 12 grandchildren and wife, Kathleen Doyle.) ''I'm not grumpy,'' he barked into the phone. ''I have 5,000 things to do, and I'm continuously unproductive.''
 Mr. Ravitch seldom speaks with the governor, and they hardly meet. But cabinet members and deputies often turn to him as a sounding board, rabbi, troubleshooter. Senior officials like Mr. Megna said they relished his reports from lunches with the likes of Jamie Dimon, chairman of JPMorgan Chase, and daily phone calls with Paul A. Volcker, the White House economic adviser and former Federal Reserve chairman, who is one of Mr. Ravitch's best friends.
 Lawmakers, meanwhile, described Mr. Ravitch as a beacon of reason emanating from an executive chamber that, before its near-meltdown last week, seemed bent on turning the Legislature into Public Enemy No. 1 to reverse the governor's plummeting poll numbers. 
 ''He has the credibility that nobody else has -- not the governor's counsel, not his secretary,'' the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said of Mr. Ravitch, in an interview before last week's revelations about the governor. ''The question is, does the governor recognize that, and empower him?'' Mr. Silver paused, then added: ''The question is whether the governor even wants a budget.''
 Nothing illustrated the distance between the governor and his lieutenant more vividly than the 21-day budget amendments Mr. Paterson announced on Feb. 9. Mr. Ravitch's M.T.A. bailout was built on a new payroll tax. Now the governor wanted to increase the tax by about 60 percent in the city and halve it in the suburbs. City officials howled. Mr. Ravitch was blindsided.
 In a series of interviews over the past month, Mr. Ravitch refused to say much about his boss, other than to chirp, ''He seems to be in a good mood,'' one day after briefly poking his head into the governor's inner sanctum. He said he held out hope that Mr. Paterson would ask his help in negotiating a budget deal and that his efforts to court lawmakers would bear fruit. But he did not dispute that he had been underused.
 ''You could say, 'Ravitch isn't relevant to anything,' and that wouldn't be totally inaccurate either,'' he said.
 THE public has been most likely to encounter Mr. Ravitch in the understudy's role played by so many all-but-superfluous lieutenant governors before him.
 One wintry Monday in Schenectady, he subbed for Mr. Paterson at that rarest item on the official schedule these days: a ribbon-cutting celebrating hundreds of new jobs. General Electric had opened a new headquarters for its renewable energy division, and the state provided $5 million in incentives, but the governor skipped the victory lap.
 So that morning, Mr. Ravitch rose in his Fifth Avenue apartment at dawn, trundled once around the Central Park reservoir in a 25-degree chill -- a mostly symbolic nod to his health, given his diet of steak dinners -- showered, dressed, threw a shirt in a bag, took a few puffs on a cigarette and climbed into his state-trooper-driven sport utility vehicle for the ride north, working two cellphones.
 Arriving late at the G.E. campus, Mr. Ravitch missed the start of the V.I.P. tour, but knocked on a locked door until someone let him in. He schmoozed with the mayor of Schenectady, Brian U. Stratton, about how Mr. Stratton's father, a congressman in the 1950s, once told Gov. W. Averell Harriman where he could go. The ribbon cut, Mr. Ravitch gave a short speech lamenting that he had spent six months dealing with deficits instead of job creation. 
 On the way out, he paused for the cameras, and a local TV reporter asked about a salacious news item regarding Mr. Paterson that had surfaced over the weekend.
 ''I haven't read it,'' Mr. Ravitch lied.
 An hour later, over lunch at T. J.'s Cafe in Albany with three members of his brain trust, Mr. Ravitch wanted to know the last time anyone had studied the structure of the executive branch. He wanted to know whether the skyrocketing state debt piled up because of a lack of checks and balances in government or because of dysfunctional politics. He wanted a thinner roll for his cheeseburger.
 ''It's asserted by some that the debt explosion is a function of the public authorities and the Legislature has no control,'' he said, draining his Diet Coke. ''Which I don't think is true.'' 
 He pointed to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's effort to build a football stadium over the West Side rail yards, which he had opposed. The M.T.A.'s board should have been a check on City Hall's appetites, Mr. Ravitch said, but instead lined up behind the plan (which was ultimately killed in Albany). 
 ''They did it because the mayor's a powerful political figure,'' he explained. ''You can't take politics out of politics.''
 Another bite.
 ''Reminds me of an anecdote, fellas,'' Mr. Ravitch said, then started into one about Donald J. Trump's threatening to have him fired as chairman of the M.T.A. for refusing a tax abatement on the old Commodore Hotel.
 A DAY later, Mr. Ravitch paced in and out of his office, asking his secretary to call again down to the office of Speaker Silver's budget chief to find out when he would be ready for dinner.
 The day had begun in meetings with union leaders on the charter-school cap. ''The governor said, 'If you can solve this one, you can go to the Middle East,' '' Mr. Ravitch said, chuckling. There was another depressing briefing on the sorry state of New York's infrastructure. (How much it would cost to arrest the decay of bridges and sewage systems, he had asked, ''assuming a fairy godmother came in, the state's budgets were balanced and we didn't have health care and the teachers unions taking away all our money?'')
 Then lunch with a legislator, followed by a stroll outside the Senate chamber to survey the panorama of lobbyists and then a late-afternoon trip back down the long stone staircase to the governor's office -- and a missed step that nearly sent him tumbling.
 Sitting with Mr. Paterson's director of state operations, Valerie Grey, he had offered a piece of unsolicited advice. ''Legislature bashing,'' Mr. Ravitch warned, ''plays right into the hands of the Tea Party crowd, where people say, 'A plague on all of you.' ''
 The message seemed aimed not at Ms. Grey, but at their boss. ''There isn't an incumbent who wouldn't be vulnerable if someone wanted to spend money on the ground,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''Every one of them feels vulnerable, which makes them dig in even deeper.''
 Now, back in his soaring, opulently carved office, he paced, hit the bathroom, stared out the open window. The phone rang. It was Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, having heard a rumor that Mr. Ravitch supported the state's taking on more debt.
 ''I wouldn't be for that,'' Mr. Ravitch assured him, ''unless there were an institutionalized way of making sure it never happened again.''
 Off the phone, he sat back in his red leather chair and mused on what would happen if the March 31 budget deadline passed with the governor and Legislature still at loggerheads.
 ''I'm worried about chaos,'' he said. ''I'm worried about uncertainty. I'm worried about cash flow. If there's no budget on April 1, when do you run out of cash? Pension payments come due. School aid is due to the city -- enormous amounts. The argument against me is, we've had delayed budgets before, crises, litigation before, it all gets resolved, you're the chicken who cried wolf.'' 
 Finally, after an Asian-fusion dinner (''Not my kind of food''), he headed home to Manhattan in a heavy snow. 
 In the back of the S.U.V., Mr. Ravitch spoke about being a good listener -- and how that would help him broker a budget if anyone would let him. 
 ''The Assembly guys say, 'We had higher income taxes in Nelson Rockefeller's day, and nobody complained, because he proposed them,' '' Mr. Ravitch said. ''The Partnership'' -- the voice of New York's business elite -- ''says, 'We're more mobile than we ever were before, and we're not going to stay in New York.' '' At a recent dinner party, he heard friends talking about re-executing their wills in Florida and New Jersey to escape higher New York taxes. ''There is no right and wrong,'' he said. ''It's who you listen to.''
 The snow fell faster, and his driver eased off the gas. 
 ''The good thing is, I have a lot of nice relationships,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''The bad thing is, so far, I haven't accomplished a thing.''

HEADLINE: Spitzer, Paterson And a Cult Of Faux Piety

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Eliot Spitzer still has enough political DNA to avoid piling on. 
 It was Friday morning, and his successor as governor, David A. Paterson, was a ruin.
''Sad,'' Mr. Spitzer said of Mr. Paterson. ''I don't know enough of the facts to say anything meaningful.''
 That should not stop anyone else from stating the obvious. 
 Every minute that Mr. Paterson stays in office, he proves that the laws of political relativity do not apply in Albany.
 Two years ago this month, an article in The New York Times disclosed that Mr. Spitzer had been a customer of an escort service -- that is, a client of an expensive prostitute -- that was under surveillance by federal investigators. Less than 48 hours after the article appeared on the newspaper's Web site, Mr. Spitzer said he was sorry and resigned.
 David Paterson -- by most measures, a weaker and less popular politician than Mr. Spitzer -- has so far survived far worse: apparent abuses of power involving a victim of domestic violence. On Friday afternoon, two days after those abuses were reported, Mr. Paterson did not even apologize, much less quit. Instead, he surrendered a barren acre of land: his campaign for election to a full four-year term. 
 ''I put the people first,'' Mr. Paterson said.
 In Albany-speak, this translates to: I'm keeping my job. The People may have been First, but he was not telling them anything about what he blithely referred to as ''the latest distraction.'' 
 That distraction would be the revelations last week that a woman complained of being harassed by the State Police and contacted by Mr. Paterson himself after she tried to get a court order of protection from one of his aides, a former boyfriend she said had violently attacked her. 
 This seems like high-octane gall. Right around the time Mr. Paterson called the woman, he was publicly proclaiming the importance of protecting victims of domestic violence from manipulation by their attackers. 
 In that instance, of course, the governor was not talking about the woman who said she was attacked by his aide. He was complaining that allies of Hiram Monserrate, the Queens state senator whom his colleagues voted this month to expel, were in regular contact with a woman whose face the senator had sliced open. Such contacts showed, Mr. Paterson said, that Mr. Monserrate was not fit for public office. Mr. Paterson made no mention of that standard on Friday. 
 The fall of Eliot Spitzer was, for some, a matter of glee. He rode a much higher horse than other politicians. Told on Friday that Mr. Paterson was dropping out of the race, Mr. Spitzer said, ''Oh, of course.'' 
 With all that has gone on in the last two years, did he have any regrets about quitting so quickly? Mr. Spitzer clearly has given the subject a great deal of thought, but he did not want to discuss it on Friday. 
 He made enemies -- the right ones, in his estimation, on Wall Street -- and held a job that he had fought hard to get, but he also had a wife and children who had suffered humiliation. 
 Had he remained in office, any strengths that Mr. Spitzer might have brought to Albany were sorely needed. Every state has been reeling from the recession. The New York State Legislature has done little to address economic circumstances that are likely to have changed forever. 
 ''What happened in the last decade was a massive redistribution of wealth to people who did not create value, but simply moved assets around,'' he said. ''You look at where we were in 1945 -- we were the only place in the world with skilled labor, with education, the rule of law, a middle class with the capacity to consume. Now we're not the center of the universe. All that has moved east, to China, and Asia. Albany is a footnote issue.''
 In place of real engagement, Albany has a cult of faux piety that is deranged. In 2007, Mr. Spitzer's office gave out records that showed the use of helicopters and state troopers by Joseph L. Bruno, then the leader of the Republican majority in the State Senate. It was evident that Mr. Bruno was using expensive state resources for political purposes. Yet a series of investigations focused not on what Mr. Bruno was doing, but on the role of Mr. Spitzer and his staff in making the information public. Telling the truth became a scandal. 
 ''There were 10 different investigations,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''There's an expression in corporate litigation, the Pac-Man operation -- each investigation would go after the investigation before it.''
 This passed for accountability. Meanwhile, after years of economic growth when it was easy to govern, Mr. Spitzer said, and then stagnation, when it became more challenging, the state government had arrived in ''an era of a negative-sum game -- we're failing.''
 The ashes of the Paterson government were not a topic he wanted to dwell on.
 ''I've got to get going,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''I have a snowman to build.''

HEADLINE: Power Players, Unplugged

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
IN the fall of 2007, nerves were fraying on Wall Street. Billions of dollars promised to private equity firms to finance an epic acquisition spree were threatened, and banks wanted dealmakers to share the pain. Renegotiate the loans, the banks said. The private equity firms disagreed: a deal, they argued, is a deal. 
 As such disputes heated up, senior deal makers at Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, the powerful buyout shop, complained that Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, was fanning the flames by openly criticizing the private equity industry. 
 Trying to smooth things over, Henry Kravis, one of the firm's founders, met with Mr. Dimon and others for dinner. Things quickly turned tense. Mr. Dimon, whose bank was a major lender to K.K.R. and potentially on the hook for losses, explained that their relationship needed to work for both parties. 
 ''This relationship feels a bit one-way to me,'' he told Mr. Kravis, according to someone briefed on the dinner who requested anonymity because it was private.
 One thing that caused strain was the 2007 buyout of TXU, an energy giant based in Dallas. The TXU deal was Texas-sized in every way: valued at $48 billion, it was the largest private equity deal in history, and it involved the country's fifth-largest energy concern -- one that served about two million customers.
 A group of high-powered buyout barons, including K.K.R., the Texas Pacific Group and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, orchestrated the deal. To push it through, the deal makers pulled out all the stops. They courted environmental groups, heavily lobbied the Texas Legislature and tempted banks with the prospect of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.
 Today, the TXU deal is unwieldy and unpredictable. The buyout was, in effect, a gargantuan bet that natural gas prices would keep climbing; instead, plunging prices coupled with a hobbled national economy have cut into the cash the company generates. 
 Investors who bought $40 billion of TXU's bonds and loans -- including legendary wise men like Warren E. Buffett -- have seen huge losses as most of the bonds trade between 70 and 80 cents on the dollar. The other $8 billion used to finance the buyout came from the private equity investors themselves, along with banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup and large institutional investors like the Canadian Pension Plan. Several analysts and energy bankers say that this latter stake currently has little value. 
 TXU, rechristened as Energy Future Holdings when the deal closed in October 2007, is hardly the only private equity bet suffering these days. Many other deals from the height of the buyout boom are mired in problems, as companies buffeted by the weak economy or overwhelmed by once-plentiful and oh-so-cheap debt are struggling to stay upright. 
 ''There is no doubt that these are good companies with bad balance sheets,'' says Colin C. Blaydon, a professor at Dartmouth's business school who specializes in private equity. But some of the companies, he says, are so deeply buried that an economic rebound might not be enough to let them pay their debt. 
 ''The cash flows are not going to be strong enough to let them fully recover and dig their way out,'' he says.
 Among all the private equity deals, the TXU experiment stands out for its startling scale. Could a big utility -- especially one so larded with debt -- offer the sort of outsize returns that private equity investors typically seek? More to the point, could private equity firms take over an important, sprawling electric utility and run it in a way that would benefit the company and consumers as well as themselves and their investors? 
 In an e-mailed statement, K.K.R. and T.P.G. said that ''we believe strongly in the fundamentals of this business'' and noted that they have promised to remain the company's owners for at least five years. The firms acknowledged that the economic environment is challenging, but noted that their company has provided affordable power and new jobs and that it continues to make significant investments in Texas. 
 Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
 To a large degree, the prospects of Energy Future Holdings hinge on something it and its owners can't control: the price of natural gas. While it has insulated itself somewhat, through financial hedges that protect it from price swings, it still needs the prices to rise sharply to have any hope of paying off its staggering debt load. 
 Indeed, while the company met its roughly $3.6 billion in interest payments on its debt last year, it still faces a $20 billion balloon payment coming due in 2014. To leap that hurdle, the private equity owners have a handful of options: persuade bondholders to swap their debt at a discount for debt that matures later; sell a stake of the company in an I.P.O.; or sell assets.
 There is, of course, another option. K.K.R., T.P.G. and Goldman could put up more of their own money to shore up a company that, according to public filings, has already funneled at least $370 million in fees to the buyout team and their investors. (Investors in the buyout firms' funds, which own Energy Future Holdings, also pay the private equity firms separate management fees.)
 A rival buyout firm, the Blackstone Group, recently chose such an option by injecting $800 million to reduce debt of one of its acquisitions, Hilton Hotels. While Paul Keglevic, chief financial officer of Energy Future Holdings, says such a move might occur at his company, it's not first on his list. ''Right now,'' he says, ''we're considering other alternatives.''
 TEXAS may be famous for big personalities, but C. John Wilder tested even those standards. 
 In 2006, Mr. Wilder, then the chief executive of TXU, was one of the most controversial men in the state. First, he angered consumers and legislators when he refused to lower electricity prices after hurricanes led to a price spike. In the same year -- just days before Earth Day -- he announced plans for TXU to build 11 coal-fueled power plants, which set off a wave of protests statewide. 
 Coal plants are notorious for coughing out pollutants into the air and water, and the announcement caused a powerful and unlikely alliance of environmentalists, mayors, chief executives, consumer advocates and state legislators to battle the company's plans.
 At the same time, Mr. Wilder was also in talks with various private equity firms, including K.K.R. and T.P.G., about a possible investment in the business. But by November 2006, at the zenith of the buyout binge, K.K.R. and T.P.G. had decided they wanted to buy the entire company. (Mr. Wilder, who stepped down as C.E.O. when TXU was sold, did not return calls requesting an interview.)
 After all, in 2004 a group of four buyout firms, including T.P.G. and K.K.R., had bought an electricity company, Texas Genco, and flipped it about a year later for a tidy profit of $4.9 billion.
 For its part, TXU was hardly a company that needed rescuing by the brightest minds on Wall Street. It was minting money in the partially deregulated Texas energy market, and in 2006 alone it generated about $2 billion in cash, after it paid interest on its debt and other bills, according to Moody's. 
 That a buyout was even a possibility was a sign of the times. Just a few years earlier, a large private equity fund might have had $5 billion to invest. Now, firms were amassing funds of $15 billion or even $20 billion to play with. 
 In 2005, the $11.3 billion acquisition of a technology company, SunGard, ranked as one of the biggest buyouts ever. That deal required the participation of seven firms. In late 2006, just two private equity firms banded together for the $28 billion takeover of Harrah's Entertainment. 
 But in the TXU quest, K.K.R. (run by Mr. Kravis), T.P.G. (run by another storied dealmaker, David Bonderman) and Goldman needed more than just cheap and easy bank loans. Because it was an influential utility, TXU was a political hot potato. Snaring it would require an elaborate charm offensive. 
 To that end, the K.K.R. group spent at least $17 million on lobbying (including 2,400 breakfast tacos on the Legislature's opening day and San Antonio Spurs tickets for certain state representatives), according to Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog group. According to the group and others, the lobbying money was used to win over opponents in the Texas Legislature and fend off legislation that would have given regulators power to veto the deal.
 ''When I started hearing certain legislative members -- members who would naturally otherwise be allies to us -- parrot the bullet points that were being made by the company, I knew we were in trouble,'' recalls Tim Morstad, who represented AARP and who was an advocate for significant electricity rate cuts. 
 The buyout group also sought friends in high places. It signed on several powerful Texas politicos as lobbyists, directors or advisers, including Ronald Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas who is now the Obama administration's trade representative; James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state and Bush family confidant, who was given a million shares as part of the buyout; Donald L. Evans, the former secretary of commerce; and Lyndon L. Olson Jr., a former Texas state representative.
 ''They were hiring Democrats and Republicans alike,'' says Tom Smith, director of the Texas division of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. ''They would have hired a socialist if we had any in Texas.''
 Other advisers for the buyout team approached environmentalists, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and James D. Marston and Fred Krupp, two leaders of the Environmental Defense Fund, to support the deal. The buyout team offered to cut the number of proposed coal-fueled plants to 3 from 11. 
 When the deal was announced on Feb. 26, 2007, Mr. Krupp heralded it as ''one of the most significant developments in America's fight against global warming'' and commended K.K.R. and T.P.G. for dropping 8 of the 11 proposed coal plants, along with other commitments. 
 But TXU had already faced challenges to its permits, and many people say they believed that it was never going to build all 11 plants anyway. 
 ''We knew we could do three,'' says Kerney Laday, a former TXU director. ''We thought that was absolutely possible.'' 
 For consumer advocates, ''the critical question was with the amount of debt required to do this deal, whether or not that would find its way into the cost of electricity,'' recalls Sylvester Turner, a Democratic state representative from Houston. ''Would consumers and small businesses end up having to pay much more?'' 
 Ultimately, the buyout group agreed to hold a majority stake in the company for at least five years and to reduce consumer electricity rates, which have remained low to this date.
 When Mr. Turner hauled Mr. Marston into his office to voice his displeasure over the Environmental Defense Fund's support of the buyout, Mr. Marston stood his ground.
 ''Look, TXU has a much lower carbon footprint because of the deal,'' says Mr. Marston, noting that the group has a partnership with K.K.R. to ''green'' other companies the buyout firm controls. 
 Despite fears that consumers would pay for the deal, the opposite has occurred. Consumer electricity prices have fallen in Texas as competition has heated up and demand has slipped in the weak economy. But falling prices have created enormous headwinds for a company as debt-choked as Energy Future Holdings. 
 IN the buyout boom, Wall Street banks, eager to outdeal one another, bowed to increasing demands from their lucrative private equity clients: more loans, looser terms, more skin in the game. Some of the Wall Street banks that were arranging the $40 billion in debt for the TXU deal also put in as much as $500 million of the their own cash for an equity stake in the company. 
 In the fall of 2007, as the deal was closing, a group of bankers met at K.K.R.'s New York headquarters, worried that their billions were at risk. Led by Steve Black, JPMorgan's co-head of investment banking, and Chad Leat, co-head of global credit at Citigroup, the bankers asked the private equity firms to share the pain by ponying up more fees or sweetening the loan terms.
 Mr. Kravis said the buyout group wasn't interested in renegotiating the deal. In fact, he said he was ''morally outraged'' by the request, according to five participants in the meeting. 
 ''A contract is a contract,'' Mr. Kravis said repeatedly, according to several individuals present, who asked that their names not be used because they still work with the buyout firms. After offering the banks an additional $100 million in fees, Mr. Kravis abruptly left the meeting. When he returned a few minutes later, the banks turned down his offer and the meeting disbanded without an agreement.
 Behind the scenes, K.K.R. and T.P.G. pressured the banks, suggesting that their banking relationships (and future fees) would be threatened if they kept fighting, according to bankers involved in the deal. 
 Goldman Sachs had representatives sitting on both sides of the table: the firm was one of the large private equity investors but had also acted as investment banker and lender and would, ultimately, nab a big piece of TXU's huge commodity hedging business. The bank's representatives sat quietly during the talks, according to participants. 
 Goldman was on so many sides of the TXU deal that its representatives made other lenders nervous, according to participants, because it was hard to ascertain whose interests the bank was serving.
 Concerned that the Street would back out on its commitment to finance the deal, the private equity firms ultimately agreed to more generous terms on the loans, according to a person briefed on the negotiations. The move spared the lenders hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.
 Such high-stakes battles, which occurred in a number of private equity deals, strained relationships among several banks involved in the transactions -- as evidenced by Mr. Dimon's contentious dinner with Mr. Kravis. 
 In the wake of these fights, K.K.R. conducted a survey to assess its reputation on Wall Street, according to multiple bankers. 
 Despite such internecine brawls, the TXU deal was lucrative for many behind it. The utility's former chief executive, Mr. Wilder, walked away with a payday of $226 million, according to the research firm Equilar. The Wall Street banks divvied up fees totaling nearly $1.1 billion. And the private equity firms paid themselves $300 million in fees for arranging their own deal. (The buyout group receives an extra $35 million each year in management fees.)
 ONE morning early last year, Jim Hempstead's phone started ringing off the hook. Mr. Hempstead, a Moody's analyst who had spent years watching the utility sector and had been wary of the debt since the buyout, had just told investors that he might downgrade the ratings for Energy Future Holdings' bonds and loans.
 Questioning the ability of Energy Future Holdings to remain solvent over the next few years, Mr. Hempstead predicted that the company might ask bondholders to trade in their debt at a steep discount and under new terms.
 Suddenly, bondholders were frantically calling Mr. Hempstead. Were the sponsors planning a debt exchange? Was TXU, the biggest buyout of private equity's ''golden era,'' going bust?
 In 2008, Energy Future Holdings was able to make interest payments -- which totaled nearly $10 million a day -- and cough up $3 billion to expand and maintain its infrastructure. But its A.T.M.-like ability to spit out cash, which had attracted the buyout barons, was sputtering because of collapsing natural gas prices and a weak economy that had cut electricity demand. 
 In the deregulated Texas market, electricity prices are strongly related to those of natural gas. Companies like Energy Future Holdings that can generate electricity through cheaper fuels like coal can pocket the difference.
 Last fall, Mr. Hempstead's prediction came true. Energy Future Holdings asked debtholders, whose debt was trading at a steep discount, to consider swapping some of their loans and bonds for new ones. The offer required bondholders to take a major hit -- 25 to 50 percent -- without K.K.R., T.P.G. and Goldman sharing the pain. The private equity firms, of course, are still hurting from the loss in value of their own investment in the company.
 ''It's a coercive exchange if ever we've seen one,'' wrote Tim Doherty, a bond analyst at KDP Asset Management. Predictably, few investors accepted the offer. 
 Last month, Energy Future Holdings raised even more debt in a deal that was very attractive to buyers. The company has the ability to raise an additional $3.5 billion. One possibility for the company is to raise new debt to pay down old debt. 
 For now, the company can get by until the big bills come due. Hedges are in place that will protect it somewhat from further declines in natural gas prices. It has plenty of cash, and new plants will add future capacity. The big tower of debt doesn't come due until 2014, and natural gas prices could always rise.
 But judging from how futures are trading on natural gas markets, prices may not climb high enough for K.K.R., T.P.G. and Goldman to make anything close to the returns they had once hoped for on the TXU deal. 
 The company hopes that power prices will rise to meet the projections the private equity buyers had in 2007. Mr. Keglevic, the C.F.O., said the owners' ''original thesis'' had power prices in the mid-s$60 per megawatt hour. In January 2010, the price in North Texas was $42.96. ''The difference is the economic dislocation pushed the mid-60s into 2016 rather than 2014,'' he said. But Energy Future Holdings has more than $20 billion in debt due in 2014, not 2016.
 What's clear is that a showdown will come as private equity investors try to salvage some sort of return for their trouble and debtholders try to protect what they can still hang on to.
 But recent history suggests that when it comes to troubled megadeals of the golden age of private equity, debt investors often come up short. TXU is not likely to be an exception.
 In these deals, says Mr. Blaydon of Dartmouth, ''the debtholders are going to get hosed.''

HEADLINE: It's Time for Swaps to Lose Their Swagger

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
''USING these instruments in a way that intentionally destabilizes a company or a country is -- is counterproductive, and I'm sure the S.E.C. will be looking into that.'' 
 That's what Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week when lawmakers asked him about credit default swaps during his Congressional testimony. Concerns are growing about such swaps -- securities that offer insurance-like protection and helped tip over the American International Group in 2008 when it couldn't pay mounting claims on the contracts. 
 Now, there are fears that the use of these swaps may also help propel entire countries -- think Greece -- to the precipice. 
 First, Greece employed swaps to mask its true debt picture, with the help of Wall Street bankers, of course. And now it appears that some traders are using swaps to bet that Greece won't be able to meet its debt payments and will face a possible default. 
 Mr. Bernanke is undoubtedly an intelligent man. But his view that it's ''counterproductive'' to use credit default swaps to crash an institution or a nation exhibits a certain naivete about how the titans of finance operate now. 
 High-octane trading may be counterproductive to taxpayers, for sure. But not to the speculators who win big when such transactions pay off. And in the case of A.I.G., the speculators got their winnings from the taxpayers. 
 The certainty that Mr. Bernanke expressed about the S.E.C.'s inquiry into credit default swaps is quaint as well. If the past is prologue, we might see a case or two emerge from that inquiry five years from now. The fact is that credit default swaps and other complex derivatives that have proved to be instruments of mass destruction still remain entrenched in our financial system three years after our economy was almost brought to its knees.
 DERIVATIVES are responsible for much of the interconnectedness between banks and other institutions that made the financial collapse accelerate in the way that it did, costing taxpayers hundreds of billions in bailouts. Yet credit default swaps have been largely untouched by financial reform efforts. 
 This is not surprising. Given how much money is generated by the big institutions trading these instruments, these entities are showering money on Washington to protect their profits. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reported that revenue generated by United States banks in their credit derivatives trading totaled $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2009. 
 Congressional ''reform'' plans for credit default swaps are full of loopholes, guaranteeing that another derivatives-fueled financial crisis awaits us. According to the Bank for International Settlements, credit default swaps with a face value of $36 trillion were outstanding in the second quarter of 2009, the most recent figures available. 
 Credit default swaps are ''a way to increase the leverage in the system, and the people who were doing it knew that they were doing something on the edge of fraudulent,'' said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and author of 37 books, many of them on banking. ''They were not well-motivated.''
 Mr. Mayer has been critical of credit default swaps almost since they arrived on the scene. In 1999, for example, he wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal entitled ''The Dangers of Derivatives.'' 
 ''These 'over the counter' derivatives -- created, sold and serviced behind closed doors by consenting adults who don't tell anybody what they're doing -- are also a major source of the almost unlimited leverage that brought the world financial system to the brink of disaster last fall,'' he wrote, referring to the market turmoil of 1998. ''The derivatives dealers' demands for liquidity far exceed what the markets can provide on difficult days, and may exceed the abilities of the central banks to maintain orderly conditions.''
 Calling credit derivatives ''the most dangerous instrument yet,'' Mr. Mayer concluded in his article that neither banks nor bank examiners have any idea how to handle them. ''The system is easily gamed, and it sacrifices the great strength of banks as financial intermediaries -- their knowledge of their borrowers, and their incentive to police the status of the loan,'' he wrote. 
 Pointing to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he said: ''In the presence of moral hazard -- the likelihood that sloughing the bad loans into a swap will be profitable -- the growth of a market for default risks could lead to bank insolvencies.''
 How's that for prescient? 
 His predictions having come true, I asked Mr. Mayer for solutions to the problems that credit default swaps have created. He had several.
 First, he said, those trading in swaps must be forced to put up more capital to back them so that if a client asks for payment, the issuer actually has the funds on hand to do so. 
 ''This is an insurance instrument and it must be regulated on an insurance basis with minimum reserves, instead of making deals that don't even have maintenance margin on them,'' he said. ''And I think it is an instrument that insured depositories ought not to be allowed to hold or trade.'' 
 And yet United States commercial banks, those with insured deposits, held $13 trillion in notional value of credit derivatives at the end of the third quarter last year, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The biggest players in this world are JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. 
 All of those firms fall squarely into the category of institutions that are too politically connected to fail. Because of the implicit taxpayer backing that accompanies such lofty status, derivatives become exceedingly dangerous, said Robert Arvanitis, chief executive of Risk Finance Advisors, a corporate advisory firm specializing in insurance. 
 ''If companies were not implicitly backed by the taxpayers, then managements would get very reluctant to go out after that next billion of notional on swaps,'' he said. ''They'd look over their shoulder and say, 'This is getting dangerous.'''
 But taxpayers remain decidedly on the hook for future bailouts because Congress has done nothing to eliminate the once-implied but now explicit government guarantees backing large and interconnected companies. And on derivatives trading, lawmakers' moves have been depressingly incremental.
 Mr. Mayer, for one, believes that credit default swaps must be exchange-traded so that their risks would be more evident. He dismisses the contention of big institutions in this arena that many credit default swaps cannot be traded on an exchange because they are tailor-made for particular customers.
 ''These are generic risks and can be traded generically,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''You are not insuring against a very individual risk.''
 AND what of the argument that increased regulatory oversight of credit default swaps will crimp financial innovation? 
 ''This insistence that you mustn't slow the pace of innovation is just childish,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''Innovation has now cost us $7 trillion,'' he added, referring to the loss in household wealth that has resulted from the crisis. ''That's a pretty high price to pay for innovation.''
 Couldn't agree more. Too bad Washington doesn't see it that way.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Doing Nothing

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
''Hands off my health care,'' goes one strain of populist sentiment.
 But what if?
 Suppose Congress and President Obama fail to overhaul the system now, or just tinker around the edges, or start over, as the Republicans propose -- despite the Democrats' latest and possibly last big push that began last week at a marathon televised forum in Washington.
 Then ''my health care'' stays the same, right?
 Far from it, health policy analysts and economists of nearly every ideological persuasion agree. The unrelenting rise in medical costs is likely to wreak havoc within the system and beyond it, and pretty much everyone will be affected, directly or indirectly. 
 ''People think if we do nothing, we will have what we have now,'' said Karen Davis, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit health care research group in New York. ''In fact, what we will have is a substantial deterioration in what we have.''
 Nearly every mainstream analysis calls for medical costs to continue to climb over the next decade, outpacing the growth in the overall economy and certainly increasing faster than the average paycheck. Those higher costs will translate into higher premiums, which will mean fewer individuals and businesses will be able to afford insurance coverage. More of everyone's dollar will go to health care, and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid will struggle to find the money to operate.
 Policy makers, in the end, may be forced to address the issue.
 ''It will break all of our banks if we do nothing,'' said Peter V. Lee, who oversees national health policy for the Pacific Business Group on Health, which represents employers that offer coverage to workers. ''It is a course that is literally bankrupting the federal government and businesses and individuals across the country.''
 Even those families that enjoy generous insurance now are likely to see the cost of those benefits escalate. The typical price of family coverage now runs about $13,000 a year, but premiums are expected to nearly double, to $24,000, by 2020, according to the Commonwealth Fund. That equals nearly a quarter of the median family income today.
 While some employers will continue to contribute the lion's share of those premiums, there will be less money for employees in the form of raises or bonuses.
 ''It's also cramping our economic growth,'' said Frank McArdle, a consultant with Hewitt Associates, which advises large employers and reported on the need for change for the Business Roundtable, an association of C.E.O.'s at major companies. Spending so much on health care is ''really a waste of people's money,'' Mr. McArdle said.
 The higher premiums will also persuade more businesses, especially smaller ones, to decide not to offer insurance. More people who buy coverage on their own or are asked to pay a large share of premiums will find the price too high. It doesn't take too many 39-percent increases, like the recent one proposed in California that has garnered so much attention, to put insurance out of reach.
 ''We have an affordability problem that is moving up through the middle class now,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit Washington research group.
 While estimates vary, the number of people without insurance is expected to increase by more than a million a year, said Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a Washington consumer advocacy group that favors the Democrats' approach. The Urban Institute, for example, predicts that the number of uninsured individuals will increase from about 49 million today to between 57 million and 66 million by 2019. The Democrats' plan is expected to cover as many as 30 million individuals who now are uninsured.
 There will be a cost in lives, too. Mr. Pollack's organization estimates that as many as 275,000 people will die prematurely over the next 10 years because they do not have insurance. Even people with insurance will find their coverage providing much less protection from financial catastrophe than it does now. Individuals will pay significantly more in deductibles and co-payments, for example. ''More and more families will experience huge debts and bankruptcies,'' Mr. Pollack said.
 Federal and state governments will also feel the squeeze. Medicare, the federal program for the elderly, is already the subject of much hand-wringing as its spending balloons. Medicaid, a joint program of the federal government and the states, is already struggling as states try to balance budgets hit hard by the economic downturn. Many states may be forced to cut benefits sharply as well as reduce financing for community health centers and state hospitals that serve the poor.
 ''I think we'll just see the decline of public services,'' said John Holahan, the director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute.
 Exactly how politicians, or anyone else, will react to the increasing pressures on the system is anyone's guess. If the system actually collapses, could there be a movement to adopt a government-run system, something like Medicare for all, where the whole health care system would be much more heavily regulated?
 Or maybe employers would take up the effort to figure out a better way of providing coverage.
 The states may also step up their role. Some may try to follow the lead of Massachusetts, which overhauled its own insurance market for individuals and small businesses, while others may try a series of regulatory fixes. A state senator in New Hampshire, for example, recently introduced legislation that regulates hospital prices in a fashion similar to an approach favored in Maryland.
 What seems unlikely, say policy analysts, is that Congress would try to pass anything nearly as ambitious as the bills that went through the House and Senate last year.
 ''If we fail this time, you're not going to get this Congress to take this up on a big scale,'' said Len Nichols, a health policy analyst at George Mason University who says he thinks the Democrats should go ahead and pass legislation.
 But few policy analysts think Congress can afford to do absolutely nothing. Lawmakers are instead likely to try a series of smaller fixes, said Stuart Butler, a health policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a research group that favors market solutions over a larger government role.
 After President Bill Clinton failed to get Congress to pass his health care bill in 1994, Republicans, who then had substantial victories in the House and Senate, worked with him to pass legislation like the health care privacy bill, a children's health insurance program and the Balanced Budget Act, which contained significant changes to the Medicare program. Under President George W. Bush, the Republicans went on to pass a drug benefit under Medicare. ''In the space of less than 10 years, you have several major bills,'' Mr. Butler said.
 If nothing passes now, Mr. Butler says he thinks Congress will tackle narrower areas, like insurance regulation, to make it easier for people with pre-existing medical conditions to find coverage, or maybe it will try another expansion of Medicaid or the children's program.
 But President Obama clearly prefers passage of a broader bill. In wrapping up Thursday's session with lawmakers, he and other Democrats warned that an incremental approach was likely to provide too little relief to the people already feeling the effects of a broken system. ''It turns out that baby steps don't get you to the place that people need to go,'' he said.
 And even some people without a partisan point to make argue that the series of bills passed in the last 15 years have not made enough of a dent in slowing down medical costs. ''We've had a lot of incremental reforms already,'' said Mr. McArdle, the Hewitt consultant.
 And many argue that putting off the inevitable has an additional cost. The Commonwealth Fund estimates that the nation would be spending hundreds of billions of dollars less than it does today if any of the health care legislation proposed by previous administrations had been enacted, assuming that they reduced costs by about 1.5 percentage points. If President Nixon's plan had passed, the United States might be spending a trillion dollars a year less than it does now, and President Clinton's plan would have reduced spending by some $500 billion a year.
 ''It makes a huge difference over a long period of time,'' said Ms. Davis of the Commonwealth Fund.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 7, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the cost of doing nothing to change the health care system misstated when health care premiums are likely to be nearly a quarter of a typical family's income. A premium of $24,000, projected for 2020, is a quarter of what a family is expected to earn then, not of what it earns today.

HEADLINE: Paterson Faces A Big Question: Can He Govern?

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and DANNY HAKIM; Jeremy W. Peters reported from New York, and Danny Hakim from Albany. Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
When Gov. David A. Patersonended his candidacy on Friday, he pledged to cooperate with an inquiry into his administration's handling of a domestic violence case and vowed to concentrate on his job.
 But with New York grappling with enormous problems, some of the key Democrats he will need to work with were debating a central question on Saturday: Can such a damaged and distracted leader really run the state?
 ''The issue is whether the events of the last two months have made it impossible for him to govern,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat. Mr. Brodsky said that in his view, ''If he's qualified to serve, he's qualified to run. If he's not qualified to run, he's not qualified to serve.''
 At noon on Saturday, a group of New York political leaders and longtime friends of Mr. Paterson met to try to find ways to support the governor over the remaining 10 months of his term. The group, which included Representative Charles B. Rangel; the Rev. Al Sharpton; and the Senate president, Malcolm A. Smith, said their efforts had been made more difficult because of the calls from other Democrats for the governor to resign. 
 ''It makes it worse for all of us in terms of trying to put our agenda forward,'' said Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, the Manhattan Democratic chairman. ''It weakens the agenda. It's a distraction.''
 Asked whether Mr. Paterson could continue to govern, Mr. Rangel responded: ''It's a rough job.''
 The meeting was both a blunt discussion of Mr. Paterson's failings as a leader and an outpouring of sympathy for the difficult reality the governor and his family now face. According to people who attended the two-hour discussion, the group finally agreed on the need to put Mr. Paterson's troubles aside and look for ways to work with him to prevent the state government from slipping into further disarray.
 Certainly the next month is likely to be dreary for the governor. Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo's investigators plan to spend the next four weeks interviewing administration officials who had a role in the response to the case of domestic violence, which involved a close aide to Mr. Paterson.
 The attorney general's inquiry seeks to determine whether any criminal wrongdoing occurred. Even if there was none, the details of the administration's actions in the case will be revealed, bringing more attention to one of the worst chapters of Mr. Paterson's tenure as governor.
 Federal investigators also recently subpoenaed records from Mr. Paterson's administration relating to its decision to award a casino contract at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens to a politically connected bidder.
 And the state faces a March 31 deadline to produce a new budget for the next fiscal year, but Mr. Paterson has not held any talks in recent weeks with legislative leaders about how to deal with an $8 billion shortfall.
 In fact, the governor's relationship with the Legislature is so strained that when Mr. Paterson called the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, on Friday to say he was dropping out of the race for governor, it was his first conversation with Mr. Silver in a month.
 ''He is clearly governing now in really unprecedented times,'' said James R. Tallon Jr., the president of the United Hospital Fund and the former majority leader of the Assembly. Mr. Tallon cited ''the political complexity of the governor's office,'' the chaotic nature of the narrowly divided Senate, ''and the depth of the financial and economic challenges that face the state.''
 ''Clearly, stepping away from a campaign has to, at least in some sense, open up the possibility of advancing some of the governmental discussions, but the size of the problem is huge and the underlying political tensions are largely still there,'' added Mr. Tallon, who has been an informal health policy adviser to the Spitzer and Paterson administrations.
 And adding to the difficulties, the always unsettled State Senate lacks a governing majority after its ouster last month of Senator Hiram Monserrate of Queens. That means neither party now has the 32 votes needed to pass legislation in the Senate. A special election in Mr. Monserrate's district is scheduled for March 16.
 The domestic violence case that led to the crisis for Mr. Paterson involved one of his closest aides, David W. Johnson. A former companion of Mr. Johnson's said that he choked her and threw her into a mirrored bureau last Oct. 31, and that State Police put pressure on her not to pursue an order of protection against him. She had twice obtained temporary orders of protection, but on the day before she was supposed to go court to seek a final order, an administration official called her and asked her to phone Mr. Paterson. After she and the governor spoke, she did not show up in court the next day, resulting in the matter being dropped.
 Mr. Cuomo's investigators have been moving quickly to interview those involved.
 Some lawmakers wondered whether the governor, whose focus has been distracted in recent weeks, would be able to take on all the problems of the state, along with the more personal stress of the inquiry.
 ''What I'm most afraid of is what will happen as the investigation drags on,'' said Assemblyman Jeffrion L. Aubry, a Queens Democrat. ''We have a lot of allegations swirling around, and I don't know how quickly we can get those cleared up.''
 At the meeting at Sylvia's, the soul food diner that has long been a favorite gathering spot for Harlem's political establishment, Mr. Sharpton told the group of about two dozen black, Latino and Asian leaders, including former Representative Harold E. Ford Jr. and Representative Gregory W. Meeks, that continued focus on the scandal would be especially painful for their communities at a time of economic distress.
 It seemed to make a difference, at least to Comptroller John C. Liu of New York City, who on Friday had called for the governor to step down. On Saturday, Mr. Liu would say only that he was focused on issues like creating jobs and improving education. ''The fact of the matter is that the tremendous amount of leadership represented in this room will help us get to the goal -- the goal of jobs, education, health care and housing,'' he said.
 Mr. Sharpton said the group was requesting a meeting with Mr. Paterson in the next few days to discuss how to shift attention back to the grave problems confronting the state.
 Some in Albany said they hoped that Mr. Paterson's announcement on Friday that he was abandoning his six-day-old campaign would offer a true chance at redemption for a governor who has been criticized as erratic and disengaged -- a last-ditch opportunity for Mr. Paterson to restore his image.
 ''It is an opportunity to think about a legacy,'' said Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Buffalo Democrat. ''There are some people who run for office who say they are going to act and lead as if they are not going to run for re-election. It's another way of saying they are not going to pander and appeal to special interests, and he now has the opportunity to be that person.''
 Similarly, another Assembly Democrat, Adriano Espaillat of New York City, said: ''Great crises also sometimes bring about great opportunities.'' Without the distractions of a campaign, Mr. Espaillat said, Mr. Paterson will have more time to devote to crucial legislative business.
 The natural step, some Democratic lawmakers said, would be for Mr. Paterson to turn over the budget negotiations entirely to Richard Ravitch, the lieutenant governor. But so far, the governor has not given Mr. Ravitch much authority.
 Others noted that even lame-duck governors remain powerful, because state law gives them substantial leverage over the budget process.
 Mr. Paterson's aides are trying to project, as much as possible, some degree of normalcy. The governor, who had scheduled no public events over the weekend, will discuss the budget Monday at a $75-a-person breakfast hosted by The New York Observer.
 ''He'll be focused on the budget,'' Mr. Paterson's communications director, Peter E. Kauffmann, said Saturday in an e-mail message. ''Budget. Budget. Budget.''
 Of course, some take the long view. Albany never really seems to function efficiently. The idea that Mr. Paterson's problems in particular will throw it off kilter is laughable, they say.
 ''People are thinking abstractly that things would go back to normal if only the governor's issues were resolved. Wake up!'' said Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democrat who represents Upper Manhattan and part of the Bronx. ''If we had an amalgamated version of Al Smith and Franklin Roosevelt, this place would still be a mess.''

HEADLINE: A Young and Unlikely Activist Who Got to the Tea Party Early

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- Keli Carender has a pierced nose, performs improv on weekends and lives here in a neighborhood with more Mexican grocers than coffeehouses. You might mistake her for the kind of young person whose vote powered President Obama to the White House. You probably would not think of her as a Tea Party type. 
 But leaders of the Tea Party movement credit her with being the first. 
 A year ago, frustrated that every time she called her senators to urge them to vote against the $787 billion stimulus bill their mailboxes were full, and tired of wearing out the ear of her Obama-voting fiance, Ms. Carender decided to hold a protest against what she called the ''porkulus.'' 
 ''I basically thought to myself: 'I have two courses. I can give up, go home, crawl into bed and be really depressed and let it happen,' '' she said this month while driving home from a protest at the State Capitol in Olympia. ''Or I can do something different, and I can find a new avenue to have my voice get out.''
 This weekend, as Tea Party members observe the anniversary of the first mass protests nationwide, Ms. Carender's path to activism offers a lens into how the movement has grown, taking many people who were not politically active -- it is not uncommon to meet Tea Party advocates who say they have never voted -- and turning them into a force that is rattling both parties as they look toward the midterm elections in the fall.
 Ms. Carender's first rally drew only 120 people. A week later, she had 300, and six weeks later, 1,200 people gathered for a Tax Day Tea Party. Last month, she was among about 60 Tea Party leaders flown to Washington to be trained in election activism by FreedomWorks, the conservative advocacy organization led by Dick Armey, the former House Republican leader.
 This month, a year to the day of her first protest, Ms. Carender stood among a crowd of about 600 on the steps of the State Capitol, acknowledging the thanks from a speaker who cited her as the original Tea Party advocate. Around her were the now-familiar signs: ''Can you hear us now?'' ''Is it 2012 yet?'' ''Tea Party: the party of now.'' 
 Jenny Beth Martin, a national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots, an umbrella organization of local groups that Ms. Carender has joined, calls her an unlikely avatar of the movement but an ideal one. She puts a fresh, idealistic face on a movement often dismissed as a bunch of angry extremists. 
 ''She's not your typical conservative,'' she said. ''She's an actress. She's got a nose ring. I think it's the thing that's so amazing about our movement.''
 The daughter of Democrats who became disaffected in the Clinton years, Ms. Carender, 30, began paying attention to politics during the 2008 campaign, but none of the candidates appealed to her. She had studied math at Western Washington University before earning a teaching certificate at Oxford -- she teaches basic math to adult learners -- and began reading more on economics, particularly the writings of Thomas Sowell, the libertarian economist, and National Review. 
 Reading about the stimulus, she said, ''it didn't make any sense to me to be spending all this money when we don't have it.''
 ''It seems more logical to me that we create an atmosphere where private industry can start to grow again and create jobs,'' she said. 
 Her fiance, Conor McNassar, urged her to channel her complaints into a blog, which she called Liberty Belle. 
 ''He didn't mind hearing it,'' she said. ''He just couldn't hear it all the time.''
 It was not enough. 
 So she called the city parks department, which suggested a location and gave her a permit. She still did not know if any other protesters would show up. 
 She put out the word to some friends from the Young Republicans, which she had joined in late 2008, but it was not a big group. She called Michael Medved, the Seattle-based conservative radio host, but he did not put her on the air. She scanned a list of economics professors who had signed a Cato Institute letter opposing the stimulus and found two locally, but they could not make it.
 She also called someone she had met at an election results watch party, who agreed to spread the word among Republicans. She called a conservative local radio host, who put in a plug. And she sent an e-mail message to the conservative writer Michelle Malkin, who agreed to announce the protest on her blog and even sent some pulled pork to feed the crowd.
 The porkulus protest did not draw enough people to finish the pulled pork, which Ms. Carender took to a homeless shelter. But she collected e-mail addresses, remembering that Senator Barack Obama had done that at events as he prepared to run for president. 
 The ''tea party'' label came three days later, from a rant the CNBC correspondent Rick Santelli delivered from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the nationwide protests followed. 
 Six weeks later, Ms. Carender's e-mail list had grown to 1,000 -- it is now 1,500 -- allowing her to summon protesters on short notice and making her the model child of the Tea Party Patriots, which has since become a driving force for advocates nationwide with its weekly conference calls to coordinate Tea Party activity.
 In her activism, Ms. Carender has also drawn on her theatrical experience. Discovering that advocates of a health care overhaul were marching in the city last summer, she staged a ''funeral for health care,'' with protesters wearing black and bagpipers playing. For her first Tea Party event, she dressed as Liberty Belle (newspaper accounts mistook her for Little Bo Peep). 
 In a video viewed 68,000 times on YouTube, she confronted Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington, at a town-hall-style meeting on health care. ''If you believe that it is absolutely moral to take my money and give it to someone else based on their supposed needs,'' she said, waving a $20 bill to boos and cheers, ''then you come and take this $20 and use it as a down payment on this health care plan.''
 Ms. Carender is less certain when it comes to explaining, for instance, how to cut the deficit without cutting Medicaid and Medicare.
 ''Well,'' she said, thinking for a long time and then sighing. ''Let's see. Some days I'm very Randian. I feel like there shouldn't be any of those programs, that it should all be charitable organizations. Sometimes I think, well, maybe it really should be just state, and there should be no federal part in it at all. I bounce around in my solutions to the problem.''
 She, like many Tea Party members, resists the idea of a Tea Party leader -- ''there are a thousand leaders,'' she says.
 Glenn Beck? ''He can be a Tea Partier, but it's not like the movement bends to him.'' 
 Sarah Palin? She will have to campaign on Tea Party ideas if she wants Tea Party support, Ms. Carender said, adding, ''And if she were elected, she'd have to govern on those principles or be fired.''
 Ms. Carender herself has become a Tea Party leader, even a celebrity. 
 At the Olympia rally, she did a television interview and accepted a hug from Kirby Wilbur, the radio host who first publicized her porkulus protest. ''This is the future of the conservative movement!'' he declared upon seeing her. 
 Her biggest goal now, Ms. Carender said, is replacing Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat elected three times by wide margins, in November.
 So Ms. Carender held a small anniversary rally on Saturday at a local mall. But her focus is on vetting candidates and using the contacts she has established over the last year to get out the vote.
 ''There is no way we will out-fund-raise the liberals,'' she said. ''The only weapon we have is energy and time.''

HEADLINE: Genteel Partisan Conflict in the Senate Is Threatening to Get a Little Messier

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
In the original ''Star Trek'' series, a popular episode centered on two planets that fought a bloodless war through computer simulation but then delivered real casualties. The partisan conflict in the Senate has been waged in a similar fashion.
 While the legislative toll has been high, the struggle has been conducted in a genteel, decorous manner. Senators routinely initiate filibusters, lodge objections to votes and impose ''holds'' on White House nominees and then go about their business as they await make-or-break procedural votes. 
 Now things are threatening to get a little messier. Incensed over a decision by Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, to stand between jobless Americans and extended unemployment benefits, a group of Democrats took to the floor in a late-night session Thursday to hold Mr. Bunning's feet to the political fire.
 They castigated him, forced him to repeatedly affirm his objection and reminded him of bleak unemployment numbers in his home state. Mr. Bunning, a gruff 78-year-old baseball Hall of Famer, was aggravated to the point where he was overheard swearing on the Senate floor and complaining he had been ambushed.
 He did not budge on his objection. But Democrats said that staying late was well worth the effort since they were able to put a face -- Mr. Bunning's -- on what they called a case of Republican obstruction and show in a more graphic manner how business was being conducted, or not, in the Senate.
 ''We can't let people stay in the shadows if they are going to do these things,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, who led the impromptu floor skirmish. ''We have to call them out.'' 
 Democrats have been under pressure from their allies to be more aggressive and public in challenging Republican procedural tactics and to not quietly accept the fact that they have to consume days and produce 60 votes to move ahead on most subjects. Why not force all-night sessions? How about old-fashioned filibusters?
 Despite ample frustrations, Democrats have been reluctant to embrace such ideas. From a practical standpoint, lawmakers have busy schedules, and forcing Republicans to stay around means Democrats must stay as well. They said the filibuster had been idealized in a Jimmy Stewart, ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' fashion, when the rules make it easy for Republicans to sustain one without a single individual holding the floor for hours. 
 Then there is the fact that many senators are advanced in years and not eager to pull all-nighters.
 But Democrats said they were finding that pulling back the Senate curtain a bit had its benefits. A few weeks ago, the leadership disclosed that Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, had placed holds preventing Senate votes on dozens of administration nominations to gain leverage for some home-state projects. The revelation generated significant media buzz, and Mr. Shelby backed off in a matter of days.
 The situation with Mr. Bunning has yet to be resolved, but the showdown has already gotten plenty of attention. As they mixed it up on the Senate floor, Democrats said they found the airing of their grievances with Mr. Bunning cathartic and beneficial to the Senate.
 ''When Senator Bunning decided to do this, it came with a risk,'' said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. ''And the risk was that there were going to be senators who were going to speak out about it.'' She said that both parties had been at fault in the Senate, ''but that it is time we try to make this place work better.''
 ''I think the Senate would be a healthier place if we did it more often,'' she said.
 But stepping up their confrontations with Republicans carries risks. In Mr. Bunning's case, he was acting virtually alone and did not have the manpower or the expertise of the leadership apparatus to back him up or provide guidance in responding to the Democrats.
 Republicans said that if Democrats wanted to make such face-offs a regular event, they would force Democrats into politically embarrassing situations by proposing votes on issues Democrats wanted to avoid, like terrorism trials in the United States. 
 At the same time, these types of guerrilla tactics have the potential to further polarize the Senate just when there has been a glimmer of bipartisanship, like on the recently passed plan to spur job creation.
 And Republicans said they were willing to hang tough like Mr. Bunning, who could not leave the floor since Democrats could have then pushed the proposal through without him being present to object.
 ''I will be here as long as you are here and as long as all of those other senators are here,'' Mr. Bunning warned Mr. Durbin. ''I am going to object every time.''
 Eventually Democrats did give up, citing among other reasons the inconvenience to a tired staff that had not been forewarned about toiling late into the night. Yet Democrats seem to have relished the fight and probably will not shy from the next one.
 ''We just can't ignore these obstructions,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''This is the kind of thing that we used to just shrug our shoulders. But a lot of us have reached the end of our rope on pushing filibusters to the extreme.''

PERSON: Nancy Sweezy 

HEADLINE: Nancy Sweezy, 88, Folklorist Who Revived Jugtown Pottery

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
In the rolling Piedmont hills of North Carolina, potters were turning out fine work before the American Revolution. But by the 20th century, the tradition had faltered. Two passionate women, a half-century apart, saved it.
 Nancy Sweezy, who died on Feb 6. at 88 in Cambridge, Mass., was the second. 
 Riding a surge of interest in folk arts in the 1960s and 1970s, Ms. Sweezy revived Jugtown, the famous pottery that the first of the two women, Juliana Royster Busbee, started in 1917. 
 Ms. Sweezy begged and borrowed $22,500 to buy the financially staggering Jugtown in 1968. She came up with new glazes to replace ones that used lead, and gave them names like Blueridge Blue and Dogwood White.
 She recruited talented apprentices; leaned on influential acquaintances, including Rockefellers, for support; developed marketing strategies; and got Jugtown pottery into upscale Northern stores before selling the establishment in 1980. In 2006 the National Endowment for the Arts designated Ms. Sweezy ''a national treasure,'' saying that her efforts had ''helped inspire a revival of the traditional pottery community.'' The number of potteries in the area around Seagrove, N.C., rose from 7 in 1968 to more than 100.
 Mary Farrell, an expert Seagrove potter who apprenticed at Jugtown, said that ''there wouldn't even be a pottery area here'' had Ms. Sweezy not come.
 Ms. Sweezy became involved in Jugtown while shopping for traditional crafts in North Carolina to stock a shop she owned in Cambridge.
 By contrast, Ms. Busbee fell in love with a striking orange plate she saw at a county fair in North Carolina. She and her husband, Jacques, a mural painter, scouted the area around Seagrove to find descendants of potters from Staffordshire, England, who arrived as early as 1740.
 They found a few potters dabbling in the old traditions by making plates and pickle jars to satisfy local demand. The Busbees moved into a log cabin in a settlement they named Jugtown, the generic name for rural potteries that supplied earthen vessels to moonshiners.
 In their rustic new home, the Busbees nurtured the resurrection of old ways, sometimes in new styles. They opened a tearoom in Greenwich Village, and later a store on the Upper East Side, to sell Jugtown products.
 Eleanor Roosevelt pointed out Jugtown pottery by name as she passed a store window in North Carolina in 1934, according to a report in The New York Times. Tiffany carried the brand.
 When Ms. Sweezy and her daughter Lybess came shopping in March 1968, they learned that Jugtown was in danger of closing.
 ''Mother and I looked at the log cabin house and the kilns, which were falling apart,'' Lybess Sweezy told The Times in 1969. ''And we made up our minds to buy it in an hour.''
 Nancy Sweezy was born Nancy Thompson on Oct. 14, 1921, in Flushing, Queens. After her parents divorced, she was adopted and became Nancy Adams. She attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and later worked in the research branch of the Office of Strategic Services, the spy agency.
 She was assigned to Berlin and would later relate an experience she had there: a diplomat interested in courting took her inside Hitler's bunker.
 In the 1960s, she was president of the board of Club 47, later known as Club Passim, a coffeehouse that was at the epicenter of the folk music craze in Cambridge. Through folk music and crafts, she met Ralph Rinzler, who did fieldwork for the Newport Folk Festival. He helped Ms. Sweezy get started at Jugtown before leaving to start the Smithsonian Folklife Festival.
 It was an adjustment. The arrivals had to carry water in buckets until a new well was drilled.
 But Mr. Rinzler said in a 1996 oral history that Ms. Sweezy's ''very gentle way of making suggestions'' helped local people not see her ''as some Yankee coming in and running the show.''
 Ms. Sweezy later helped Asian refugees develop traditional crafts for the American market; wrote and edited books; and organized museum exhibitions devoted to Southern pottery, Armenian crafts and other topics.
 Ms. Sweezy's marriage to Paul Sweezy, the influential leftist economist, ended in divorce, as did a brief earlier marriage to Bill House. She is survived by her son, Sam; her daughters, Lybess and Martha; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. She died of congestive heart failure, Lybess Sweezy said.
 In 1978, in his syndicated column, James Kilpatrick marveled that eight years earlier Ms. Sweezy had repaid a $2,500 state grant, which she had used to buy new kilns, even though paying back the money had meant putting off buying a truck.
 ''There are others,'' he quoted her as saying, ''who need help more than we do.''

HEADLINE: Excuse Me, Is This Seat Taken?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
FLYING in coach is never comfortable, but it's getting downright awkward for bigger passengers as airlines increasingly single out customers they deem too fat to fly. 
 The issue made headlines in early February when the director Kevin Smith, best known for ''Clerks'' and ''Chasing Amy,'' was thrown off a Southwest Airlines flight from Oakland to Burbank, Calif., because the crew determined he was too big. Mr. Smith turned to his Twitter account to vent: ''I broke no regulation, offered no 'safety risk' (what, was I gonna roll on a fellow passenger?). I was wrongly ejected from the flight.''
 Southwest, like most of the major United States carriers, has had a formal policy in place for years requiring that passengers who can't physically fit into a single airline seat must buy two. Though such rules have long been denounced as discriminatory by advocates for the obese, they have gained the support of fliers who believe charging passengers who take up more room than the average person is only fair. Regardless of which side of the debate you are on, shrinking airline capacity has aggravated the issue with passengers of all sizes facing more tightly packed flights and cramped seating. 
 ''I fly coast to coast several times a year, and I cannot tell you how many times I have been pinned in by a morbidly obese human,'' said Mark Sweeting, a frequent flier from Portland, Ore., who says he used to request an exit row seat for the extra legroom, but that he now avoids that row having noticed that large passengers often request those seats for the same reason. ''I don't know what the correct solution is,'' he said, ''But it is a real problem.'' 
 Some airlines have responded by tweaking their policies to encourage large passengers to buy more space. On Feb. 1 Air France, which for the last five years has offered ''passengers with a high body mass'' the option of buying a second seat in economy at a 25 percent discount, said it would reimburse the cost of the second seat if the plane wasn't full. Last year, United set a formal policy to get large passengers to buy an upgrade or extra seat after it received 700 complaints in 2008 from customers whose seatmates did not fit into a single seat. Since then, said Robin Urbanski, a United spokeswoman, that number has dropped to about 100.
 Airlines are generally clear about how they determine when a customer must purchase an additional seat or upgrade. Southwest uses the armrest test, requiring customers who cannot lower both armrests to buy an extra seat. Continental says customers must be able to wear the seatbelt, with one extension if necessary, remain seated with the armrests down for the entire flight and ''not significantly encroach upon the adjacent seating space.'' 
 But the enforcement of such rules can result in humiliation when large customers are singled out in front of a plane full of passengers. Mr. Smith, who was put on a subsequent Southwest flight and offered a $100 voucher, summed it up in one sarcastic tweet: ''The @SouthwestAir Diet. How it works: you're publicly shamed into a slimmer figure. Crying the weight right off has never been easier!''
 Mr. Smith had initially paid for two seats, but tried to fly standby for an earlier flight that had only one open seat left. After he had taken that seat, Mr. Smith was told he was deemed a safety risk. Southwest stated in a blog post on its Web site soon after the incident that ''a timely exit from the aircraft in the event of an emergency might be compromised if we allow a cramped, restricted seating arrangement.'' 
 Advocates for the obese say charging bigger passengers for an extra seat is simply not a solution. Such policies ''add yet another way to discriminate against already marginalized fat people,'' said Peggy Howell, public relations director at the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, a nonprofit civil rights organization. She added, ''We see this as more of an attempt at getting more money out of the consumer's pocket than any concern for our well-being as some have claimed.''
 But fliers who have been encroached on by a large passenger say not addressing the issue is not fair, either. When I wrote about the photo of an obese airline passenger making its way around the Internet in December, 200 readers posted comments to the blog post at nytimes.com/intransit. Many said charging customers who take up two seats for both of them is reasonable. They recounted flights where an obese passenger infringed on their space. ''While I understand it's not easy for anyone involved, including the obese passenger, I once was unable to move for about three hours during a flight because I was literally sandwiched between the obese passenger next to me and the window,'' posted Bridget Jesionowski, of Claremont, Calif. ''I was uncomfortable and I know she was as well, as she kept apologizing to me.''
 Because the rules aren't consistently enforced, passengers crowded by a seatmate often find themselves making the difficult choice between confronting that seatmate about his or her size or enduring the discomfort for the entire flight. 
 On a cross-country flight from Philadelphia to San Diego in October, Matt G. Sampson, a doctor from Bala Cynwyd, Pa., who was traveling to a conference, said he was forced to give up his window seat when a ''morbidly obese woman'' took the seat next to him. ''Upon sitting down, there were large portions of her right side physically touching my body,'' said Mr. Sampson, 5-foot-8 and 160 pounds. 
 Southwest didn't get involved in any way, he said. And since Mr. Sampson said he didn't want to complain about his neighbor's mass, he forfeited his window seat and switched to a middle one three rows up between two smaller passengers. Mr. Sampson stressed that he didn't think his seatmate was doing anything wrong. ''She was within the rules at hand,'' he said. But he said he felt he'd lost out nonetheless. ''She ended up having a more comfortable seat than I ended up with.''
 In response to Mr. Sampson's predicament, Chris Mainz, a spokesman for Southwest, said: ''We strive to be consistent enforcing our policy to avoid this very situation, and all indications tell us its working. That said, we apologize for Mr. Sampson's inconvenience.''
 Airlines need to acknowledge that the current policies aren't solving a problem but are rather turning one passenger's comfort into another passenger's embarrassment. Another solution must be found. (How about some wider seats in coach?) 
 Southwest, for one, seems to be considering a different approach after the public relations fiasco following the incident with Mr. Smith. Forty-eight hours after the news of his removal from a Southwest plane blasted through the blogosphere and celebrity news channels, the airline refunded his airfare, admitted it was ''a mistake in trying to board him as a standby passenger and then remove him,'' and said it would be reviewing ''how and when this delicate policy is implemented.''

HEADLINE: In a Country of Monopoly Newspapers, Palo Alto Is Awash in Competition

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
People in Palo Alto frequently call Dave Price a contrarian. While they typically mean it as a slam, Mr. Price, the co-founder and editor of the Palo Alto Daily Post, considers it a badge of honor. 
 ''We are contrarian, but there are good reasons to be that way,'' said Mr. Price, whose newspaper opposes just about everything that the city government does.
Mr. Price's contrarian streak extends to his take on the newspaper business. He started The Daily Post in 2008, as the recession forced further cutbacks and closings at many of the nation's already suffering newspapers. And in a time when most newspaper publishers spend much effort figuring out how to profit from the Web, The Daily Post is proudly print-only.
 ''Giving away news online is a dumb way to do business,'' according to its Web site, which does not post any news. 
 Yet Mr. Price said the Daily Post broke even within a year. ''Every month, revenue goes up,'' he said. 
 Mr. Price is not the only one defying conventional journalism wisdom. Palo Alto, a highly wired Silicon Valley community, is, too.
 At a time when many cities struggle to support one newspaper, Palo Alto has three: The Daily Post, The Daily News, which began publishing in 1995, and The Palo Alto Weekly, which has a daily online edition and has been around since 1979.
 This month, in the days after the crash of a small plane caused a 10-hour blackout in Palo Alto and killed three employees of Tesla Motors, the three papers, combined, published some 30 articles examining everything from the city's response to the power grid's connection with the city-run electric utility. 
 And in a city where laptops, iPhones and Kindles are standard issue, many residents still walk a block or two to pick up one of the city's newspapers, all of which are free. 
 ''It is phenomenal to go into a coffee shop in the morning and see people reading local newspapers,'' said Ted Glasser, a professor of communications at Stanford. ''These are manageable newspapers. You can read them in 15 or 20 minutes.'' 
 Whether the competition amounts to an old-fashioned newspaper war or a skirmish between struggling outfits with bare-bones staffs is a matter of debate.
 ''This newspaper war is probably being conducted with very low-caliber ammunition,'' said Alan Mutter, a newspaper consultant who writes a blog about the industry called Reflections of a Newsosaur. 
 The three newspapers are small. The Daily Post, the smallest, has a newsroom staff of five, and works out of a cramped warehouse space near downtown that Mr. Price likes to call the most efficient use of 800 square feet in the city. 
 The Daily News, like many other papers, has been forced to cut its staff, and some residents say it is struggling to fill a hole left by the 2007 closing of the Palo Alto bureau of The San Jose Mercury News, which is also owned by MediaNews Group. The two papers now share articles. (MediaNews Group is currently in bankruptcy, but the publisher of The Daily News said the paper's operations would not be affected.) 
 The Palo Alto Weekly also cut a few positions, mostly through attrition, and reduced its print publication to one day a week in 2008, from two. 
 Still, all three newspapers say that they are profitable and that they are here to stay.
 There are many reasons Palo Alto enjoys such a relative wealth of news coverage. It is affluent and has a highly educated, civically engaged population. Its pricey real-estate market and other high-end businesses provide a relatively strong advertising base, even during a recession. 
 But the competition is also the result of the characters involved, and in particular the outsized personality of Mr. Price. 
 ''The market hasn't demanded three newspapers,'' said Bill Johnson, the publisher of The Palo Alto Weekly, whose Web site, which attracts 130,000 visitors each month, is a virtual gathering spot for the community. ''It is circumstantial.''
 The circumstances Mr. Johnson refers to are spelled out on The Daily Post's Web site, which summarizes the story of Mr. Price and Jim Pavelich, the co-owner. 
 The two men helped to start and run The Daily News in 1995. The paper quickly became known for a confrontational style critical of City Hall and government in general. It routinely printed the salaries of all government employees. The paper quickly increased its advertising base by offering discounts to advertisers. In 2005, Knight Ridder, the owner of The Mercury News, bought The Daily News. Mr. Price said the sale price was $25 million. 
 The purchase ''was really not for the journalism,'' said Anthony P. Ridder, who was then chief executive of Knight Ridder. ''It was to provide additional ways for our advertisers to reach their customers.''
 The following year Knight Ridder was sold and split, and The Daily News ended up in the hands of MediaNews Group, which also owns most other Bay Area newspapers except for The San Francisco Chronicle. The tone of The Daily News became more traditional. 
 ''Most people in the community think it is vastly improved,'' said Mr. Johnson, of The Palo Alto Weekly, which often publishes longer, in-depth articles, like a four-month investigation into high school sports. 
 But the changes at The Daily News were not to Mr. Price's liking. He called its reporting ''namby-pamby.'' 
 Mario Dianda, the editor of The Daily News, said, ''Our stories are fair and timely.'' He said a lengthy article last week on the impact of a 22-year-old school desegregation program illustrated the paper's mission ''to provide quality community journalism.'' 
 When Mr. Price and Mr. Pavelich sold The Daily News, they signed an agreement not to compete with it for three years. They started The Daily Post weeks after the agreement expired, and quickly resumed their old approach with its motif of salary lists. The approach may have had impact: Last year, Mr. Price wrote two dozen consecutive editorials sharply criticizing a proposed business tax. The proposal failed at the polls. 
 ''The Daily Post has a pretty consistent negativism about anything that is going on in the city,'' said Larry Klein, a member of the Palo Alto City Council.
 Peter Carpenter, who has held various government positions, said he recently helped organize a meeting between residents and police officials in Atherton. Mr. Carpenter said The Daily News coverage was balanced, but The Daily Post's headline read ''Atherton Slams Cops,'' which, he said, ''says it all.''
 Mr. Price said critics objected because The Daily Post was tougher than its rivals.
 It is unclear whether multiple newspapers create a more informed citizenry. 
 ''I think we have both more informed, and on occasion more inflamed, citizens,'' said Mayor Pat Burt of Palo Alto. 
 But, he said, ''it is a challenge if good segments of the community are getting much of their information from a source that is predominantly critical.'' 
 Mr. Burt and others say, however, that it is good for the city to have a diversity of news outlets. 
 ''I am really happy that we have all these papers,'' said Esther Wojcicki, who heads the Palo Alto High School journalism program, the largest such program in the country. ''I wish that kind of choice were available to more people in more areas.''

HEADLINE: Cuts to Public Hospitals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your Feb. 22 news article ''City's Public Hospitals Fear Huge Loss in Subsidies'' sheds light on an issue that's affecting public hospitals nationwide: treating record numbers of uninsured patients in the midst of the recession and budget cuts. 
 Our research has shown that on average public hospitals are seeing a 23 percent increase in the number of uninsured patients. Likewise, enrollment in Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, has surged -- in some states by more than 10 percent -- because of the unemployment crisis. 
 Cuts to the safety net at a time when many Americans find themselves needing us most should not occur. Cuts to Medicaid as the program's rolls swell will affect those most vulnerable in our society. 
 Comprehensive health care reform is what's needed now, and it is hoped that Congress will come together on a health bill that will ensure access to care to all Americans.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths HOVEY, GRAHAM

 BODY:
HOVEY--Graham. After a long career of covering world affairs in the United States and abroad for newspapers, wire services and public radio, Graham Hovey joined The New York Times in 1965, serving on its editorial board for more than 12 years, then working in its Washington Bureau as a foreign-policy reporter until September of 1980. Mr. Hovey passed away Saturday, February 20, 2010 in the Luther Crest community in Allentown, PA. He retired from The Times in 1980 to become professor of communications at the University of Michigan and director of Michigan Journalism Fellows, a program that provides an academic year of study and research for journalists at or near mid-career. After his official retirement at 70 in 1986, Hovey remained at Michigan as a professor emeritus to teach a first-year seminar on "The Making of U.S. Foreign Policy." He and his wife, Mary Jean, moved in 1998 to the Luther Crest retirement community in Allentown, PA to be nearer their son, Thomas D. Hovey. 
Hovey attended what is now the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, but transferred to the University of Minnesota, where he became assistant city editor of the Minnesota Daily and took his BA in journalism and economics in 1939. After two years as a reporter on the Waterloo Daily Courier in Iowa, he joined the International News Service (INS) bureau in Detroit in 1940 and covered the beginnings of the conversion of Detroit-area industries for war production. Hovey became a full-time sports writer for INS in Chicago in October, 1941. He was covering an intra-city football game in Comiskey Park between the Bears and the Cardinals when he learned of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. This effectively ended Hovey's sports-writing career for he moved to the INS cable desk in New York in March, 1942, and sailed for Africa in May as an INS war correspondent. Hovey left INS late in 1944 to become a foreign-affairs reporter for the Associated Press in Washington. Two years later he joined the New Republic as an assistant editor. But in 1947 he changed course to pursue an MA in political science and history and teach journalism at the University of Minnesota. He moved in 1949 to the University of Wisconsin, where he rose to the rank of associate professor. He also broadcast a weekly program called "The Background of the News" over the university radio station WHA and nine affiliated stations of the Wisconsin State Broadcasting Service. In 1953, Hovey took leave from Wisconsin to accept a two-year Fulbright grant to Italy, where he was accredited to Radiotelevisione Italiana and broadcast a weekly "Letter from Italy" for member stations of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, a forerunner of National Public Radio. He returned to Wisconsin for the 1955-56 academic year, then joined the editorial page staff of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune, since merged as the Star Tribune. But he also covered international crises at the United Nations, winning the Overseas Press Club of America award for "Best American Press Interpretation of Foreign Affairs" and sharing a National Headliners Club award for his U.N. coverage in 1958. He was then sent to London in January, 1959, as the Minneapolis Tribune's first European Correspondent. After nearly seven years of covering NATO, the evolution of the European Common Market and Community and recurring crises with the Soviet Union over Berlin, Hovey accepted an invitation from John B. Oakes to join the editorial board of The New York Times in 1965. He wrote editorial and occasional signed columns on U.S. policies in Europe, Africa and the Americas, and often visited those areas. Hovey was married June 20, 1941, in Waterloo, Iowa, to Mary Jean Landgraf, a graduate of Columbia University's School of Library Science, who worked in libraries in Iowa, New Jersey, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Washington, DC, in addition to serving as her husband's researcher for writing and lectures. She survives along with their son, Thomas D. Hovey, his wife, Barbara A. of Forty Fort, PA; three grandchildren, Attorney Matthew T. Hovey of Pottstown, PA, Carolyn B. Hovey of Forty Fort, David L. Hovey of Forty Fort. Also surviving are two nieces, Marjorie Eger of Indiana and Lois Schmoe of Florida. Services: Private at the convenience of the family. Services by Stephens Funeral Home, Inc.

 BODY:
SATYAPAL--Dr. K.N. (Pal), 79, who retired in 1990 from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), passed away in Maryland on January 26, 2010. Pal came to the United States from India by cargo ship in the 1950's, while only in his 20's. Despite huge obstacles and losing his father, he worked hard and received a Ph.D. from Michigan State University (MSU) in agriculture and soil sciences. He chose a path of service, working for the Food and Agriculture Organization in Kabul and Tanzania, and moved to New York in 1965, recruited by UNDP. In 1962, he married Thunga, a physics professor, and had three daughters. Pal received the Distinguished Alumni Award from MSU and was honored by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research in The Hague for his "untiring, devoted, and outstanding services in support of their efforts to help alleviate hunger and poverty through scientific research." 
Pal's kindness, humor and pure child-like spirit touched the hearts of many. He opened his Kew Gardens' home of 25 years to many people until they were settled. Fluent in several languages, he had an outstanding memory and remembered hundreds of birthdays. He was known for his love of animals, music (his whistling and mimicry) and gardening, including growing banana trees and many plantings at the Maryland temple. Pal is survived by his beloved wife, three daughters (Sunita, currently chief engineer of the United States Department of Energy's Fuel Cell Program; Shobita, an astrophysicist and professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at George Mason University; and Shanti, a research analyst at the Institute for Defense Analyses), four grandchildren, and many devoted friends and relatives.

HEADLINE: Buffett's Bargain Shopping Spree

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
America's most famous investor, Warren E. Buffett, struck a confident note in his annual letter to the shareholders of his holding company on Saturday, as he described in characteristically colorful terms how his businesses had largely ridden out the calamity of the financial crisis.
 The tone of the letter contrasted sharply with Mr. Buffett's report last year, in which he took himself to task for the company's decline in book value, only the second such decline since he took control in 1965. This time he described how he had used the last 18 months to scoop up a string of assets -- a buying spree that culminated at the end of last year with the agreement to buy the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, his biggest bet yet. 
 Mr. Buffett wrote that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, had net income of $8.1 billion last year, or about $5,200 a share, 61 percent higher than in 2008. The company also reported a 19.8 percent rise in book value. 
 The crisis of 2007-8 led to the company's first operating loss in the first quarter of last year, raising questions about Mr. Buffett's exposure to consumer spending and the housing market. The company recovered strongly later in the year, however, helped by the rebound in the stock market, which strengthened his derivatives holdings. 
 In his letter, which accompanied the company's annual report, Mr. Buffett laid out in detail how many of his holdings still depended on the vagaries of housing demand and consumer spending. But shares of the company, which peaked late in 2007 around $148,220 and fell to lows of around $73,195, have since rallied to close at $119,800 on Friday.
 ''We've put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years,'' he wrote. ''It's been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend.''
 Mr. Buffett used his letter to crack jokes and issue more of his trademark aphorisms. The so-called Sage of Omaha, he is America's most listened-to investor, and his annual letter is watched closely by investors for his assessment of his businesses and of the economy.
 It has, however, taken on somewhat less importance in recent years as Mr. Buffett, 79, has raised his profile with more public speaking and interviews.
 In characteristically blunt terms, he had harsh words for unnamed chief executives and directors who oversaw disasters at their companies during the crisis but ''still live in a grand style.'' 
 He said, ''They should pay a heavy price,'' and that there must be a reform of the way executives are rewarded for their performance. ''C.E.O.'s, and in many cases, directors, have long benefited from oversized financial carrots; some meaningful sticks now need to be part of their employment picture as well.''
 He also admitted mistakes of his own, saying he had closed a troubled credit card business, which had been his idea, and had given too much time to turn around the NetJets business, long a burden.
 But he dwelt also on the lucrative positions he took in a string of companies over the last year and a half, pouring $15.5 billion into shares of companies like Goldman Sachs, General Electric and Wm. Wrigley Jr. Wishing he had taken greater advantage of the opportunities offered, he said, ''When it's raining gold, reach for a bucket, not a thimble.''
 Burlington Northern Santa Fe was Mr. Buffett's biggest purchase to date. Addressing that company's 65,000 shareholders, he offered them a primer in his investment rules. But he warned all shareholders that the bigger size of Berkshire Hathaway would probably mean slower growth in the future. 
 ''Huge sums forge their own anchor and our future advantage, if any, will be a small fraction of our historical edge,'' he said.
 Justin Fuller, the author of a blog about Mr. Buffett and a principal at Midway Capital Research in Chicago, said this company size was an important theme of the letter: ''There was a lot of talk about size and maintaining a business and how size and bureaucracy can really hurt a business over time.''
 Mr. Fuller said Mr. Buffett had also given insights into his investing strategy -- many of his businesses are now in monopoly or near-monopoly industries like railroads and utilities. 
 Mr. Buffett told a long story about the wisdom of using a company's own shares to buy another company -- which was a veiled criticism of Kraft's takeover of Cadbury, Mr. Fuller said, but also a justification of Mr. Buffett's decision to issue shares to buy Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Mr. Buffett is a major investor in Kraft but has opposed its pending acquisition of Cadbury.
 Mr. Buffett's letter is watched closely for hints about when he may retire, but this year's offered none. Talking of a time when he would be long gone, he said he was still tap-dancing to work at the end of his eighth decade.
 He said he had sold shares in ConocoPhillips, Moody's, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson, mainly to finance his railroad purchase. The shares of these companies were still likely to trade higher, he said.
 Closing the letter, Mr. Buffett, ever the cheeky salesman, invited shareholders to his company's annual meeting on May 1 in Omaha -- promising to play table tennis for spectators and urging them to buy goods and services from his companies, and ending, ''P.S. Come by rail.''
