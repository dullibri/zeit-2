HEADLINE: Video Dial Offers Opportunities for All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Video Dial Tone, Strangled," your Aug. 31 editorial about the transmission of television and other video services over telephone lines, is nothing more than one more attempt by the publishing industry to scare consumers and conjure up fears that telephone companies -- if they are given the freedom to participate fully in the video programming market -- would somehow restrict access to future services. 
 This position is based on the myopic credo that new information choices and increased competition are not good for the newspaper industry and, therefore, not good for the American consumer.
The argument simply does not stand up to a clear examination of the facts. Moreover, it flies in the face of an important economic principle: Let the customer decide.
Here's the reality. The Federal Communications Commission's decision to allow telephone companies to develop and offer a video dial tone service is encouraging. It's a small first step toward developing a nationwide fiber-optic network capable of carrying entertainment and other services, such as interactive educational programs, videophone and medical imaging.
Congress must take the next step by lifting the restrictions of the 1984 Cable Act, which prohibit telephone companies from owning programming. Allowing telephone companies to compete freely in this market would accelerate the development of a ubiquitous fiber network to which all information providers, and that includes newspapers, would have equal access.
Newspapers -- instead of taking self-serving editorial positions that are aimed merely at protecting advertising revenues and stifling competition -- should focus their energies on exploring ways to participate in this exciting medium, which will have the capacity to deliver interesting, useful and innovative multimedia services for customers across the country.

As the Saying May Go, Too Many Suits Spoil the Sports

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time, sports in September meant athletes in action. Whether in newspaper photos or videotape, quarterbacks were throwing passes or sluggers were hitting home runs. But none of those athletes was wearing a business suit.
If somebody was wearing a business suit in a newspaper photo, you knew to keep searching for the sports section. 
 If somebody was wearing a business suit on television, you knew it had to be a politician or a mob boss on trial.
But as leaves began turning this September, sports turned into ads for men's clothiers. While quarterbacks and sluggers were all but ignored, pro football attorneys in a Minneapolis courtroom and baseball club owners in a St. Louis hotel were wearing their most sincere suits in trying to cope with free agency.
Pro football was trying to come to grips with it. Baseball was trying to come to its senses over it.
Even though a Federal Court jury of eight women decided that the National Football League's system of Plan B free agency violated the antitrust laws, the N.F.L. chirped that it had "won" its basic argument. The jury agreed that Plan B (whereby each of the 28 teams cavalierly exposes all but its best 37 players to other teams in the off season) had "significantly contributed to competitive balance."
But how can anything contribute to something that doesn't really exist?
If there were "competitive balance," every team would finish at .500.
In any team sport, winning depends on a club's judgment in selecting players, the hunger of those players for success, its coaching or managing, and its luck in averting injuries. Not on how much money it pays its players.
According to the usual storm warnings, the N.F.L. franchises that could afford the best free agents would produce the best teams.
Maybe so, but it's not working that way in baseball this season. According to the contracts of players on opening-day rosters, the Mets had the highest average salary: more than $1.7 million. The Los Angeles Dodgers had the second highest: more than $1.6 million.
As every Shea Stadium student knows, the Mets are far under .500, far out of the National League East race. The Dodgers are trying not to finish under .400, deep in last place in the National League West. So much for big payrolls.
Of baseball's four first-place teams, the Toronto Blue Jays ranked fourth in average salary (before they obtained David Cone), the Oakland Athletics eighth (before the Jose Canseco trade), the Pittsburgh Pirates 10th, and the Atlanta Braves llth.
The two surprise contenders, the Baltimore Orioles and the Montreal Expos, ranked 23d and 24th, respectively.
Of baseball's 25 top salaried players this season, only 6 are on the four divisional leaders. Ruben Sierra (acquired by the Athletics from the Texas Rangers in the Canseco deal) ranks third, Barry Bonds of the Pirates sixth, Doug Drabek of the Pirates eighth, Jack Morris of the Blue Jays 10th, Andy Van Slyke of the Pirates 14th and David Cone of the Blue Jays 16th.
When a more liberated form of free agency is ordered or negotiated in the N.F.L., the same situation will apply.
Pro football teams that load up on established free agents with Super Bowl rings will discover that those players will often be past their peak, both physically and emotionally. The more money and more glory an athlete has, the less the urgency to win. Especially in football where the collisions sound like automobile accidents. And the older the player, the more susceptible he is to injury.
The pro football draft of college talent supposedly contributes to competitive balance. If so, how come the Cleveland Browns, the Detroit Lions, the Phoenix Cardinals, the San Diego Chargers, the Houston Oilers, the Atlanta Falcons, the New Orleans Saints, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Seattle Seahawks have never been to the Super Bowl? Because too many other clubs were better judges of talent and better judges of coaches.
With that in mind, consider that having forced Fay Vincent's resignation as commissioner, the baseball club owners anointed Allan (Bud) Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers chairman of the major league executive council.
To some baseball people, Selig is known as Bud Lite, hardly a compliment in Milwaukee, a city that another beer professes to have made famous. And for all of Selig's protests of how difficult it is for smaller-market clubs to prosper in the national economy, it's even more difficult when talent is misjudged.
Selig's front office decided that Gary Sheffield would never fulfill his potential. Selig concurred. Traded to the San Diego Padres, Sheffield is threatening to lead the National League in batting, homers and runs batted in.
It's enough to make you wonder if maybe Bud Selig misjudged Fay Vincent, too. Just as all the baseball club owners have misjudged the multimillion-dollar salaries that have created an erosion of baseball's finances, an erosion dressed in all those business suits worn by the club owners in photos and videotape.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
N.F.L. to Look at New Labor Game Plans

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE

 BODY:
On the heels of having their Plan B system of free agency struck down by the jury decision in Minneapolis last week, the National Football League club owners will meet in Dallas on Thursday and plan a course of action: either continued fighting in the courts or a new proposal on a collective-bargaining agreement.
A seven-member committee of owners plus Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and the league's lead lawyer, Frank Rothman, held a telephone conference call on Friday morning, one day after the verdict in the McNeil vs. the N.F.L. trial: that Plan B is too restrictive and illegal under antitrust law. This group will be very likely to arrive in Dallas with specific recommendations in mind. 
 The verdict said that the Plan B system, in which each N.F.L. team was allowed to protect 37 players, had a substantially harmful effect on competition for player services, that the rules were more restrictive than necessary, and that players suffered economic injury as a direct result of those rules. Four of the eight players who brought the suit received damages, totaling $1.6 million. But the ruling also said that Plan B significantly contributed to competitive balance in the N.F.L.
Because of that latter finding, the league believes that the jury was saying that some rules are necessary to maintain competitive balance, and that complete free agency for players is not desirable.
"The jury did not find any problem with these rules applied to the higher-paid players," Tagliabue said. "The guys that got damages were good players, ascending players, who were hurt by the system. The four who were perfectly well paid were shut out.
 
Bargaining Away From Table
 "When everyone settles down a little bit, because everyone gets emotional during the course of litigation, people will hopefully realize where they are. It's like a football game where people knock the hell out of each other in the first quarter and it's 14-14. Nothing happens. There are still three quarters to go. Everyone loses except the lawyers, and that's what I've been saying all along."
Everyone talks about the league and its players getting back to the bargaining table -- there has been no collective bargaining agreement since 1987 -- but the fact is that the two sides negotiated frequently throughout the Minneapolis trial, and as recently as two weeks ago held substantial talks.
Many of the issues clouding peace, other than free agency, were resolved, but a potential bargaining agreement dissolved primarily on two aspects of the free-agency issues: the league wants a hard salary cap and an exemptions whereby each team will be able to protect three players from free agency. The players will accept one or the other, but not both.
After the verdict Thursday, Gene Upshaw, director of the N.F.L. Players Association, the former union that had itself decertified to pursue legal action, said that the salary-cap issue was "out the window." He added that even the N.F.L. draft, now, could become the subject of litigation.
"That's ridiculous," Tagliabue said. "I believe a draft through eight rounds would be held perfectly viable in any court."
Any appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit of last week's decision would hinge partly on the league's view that the players association, despite its official decertification, continues to operate as a union.
"If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, well. . . . " said Art Modell, the Cleveland Browns' owner. "Hopefully, this verdict will produce new dialogue. If 37 is too many players to protect, that is subject to bargaining. Unfettered free agency just won't work. I hope we can build a bigger and better game and not wait for the courts and let juries decide our fate."
 
More Lawsuits Pending
 There are several more lawsuits pending between the two sides, including similar suits to McNeil's filed in Los Angeles and in Philadelphia and a Sept. 21 court date in Washington over developmental-squad players.
Thus far, the posturing continues and the politics rage.
"What are we spending our time in court, for example, over the developmental players, the number 48 through 53 players who a lot of times never even make it in the N.F.L.?" Tagliabue said. "We need to get out of the courts."
Modell added: "There was a time when the players were our friends and we could sit around and chew the fat. Now everyone has drawn lines. Let's seek harmony in new ways. That's my goal."

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING>;
After a Liberty Cup Is Canceled, the Pondering Begins

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
The recent cancellation of New York's 1992 Liberty Cup Match Racing Regatta came as a surprise to a yacht-racing circuit that has been riding a wave of increasing popularity and prize money the last few years.
In a sport known for the cold shoulder it generally gives to professionalism, competitive sailors find it hard to make a living. But match racing has represented a source of hope for career yachtsmen. 
 Although the eight-year-old Liberty Cup race series had never offered prize money, the event had become an important part of the international circuit. As one of 10 events on the Omega Grand Prix of Match Race Sailing, the Liberty Cup, which was scheduled to begin Wednesday, offered sailors a chance to enhance their world-class standing.
 
Crucial Points
 By performing well in Liberty Cup, sailors were awarded points that added to their world match-race rankings. With a high ranking, a Liberty Cup sailor was more likely to receive invitations to sail in the other circuit events, some of which offer purses close to $100,000. While the money amounts to a pittance compared with that awarded to top tennis players and other professional athletes, the purses often are considered the best in sailing.
Bill Darnell, executive director of the Harbor Festival Foundation, a nonprofit organization supported by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that attempted to organize the 1992 Liberty Cup series, said his group was unable to find corporate sponsorship.
Darnell said that it costs about $300,000 to $400,000 to stage a Liberty Cup regatta. "I was concerned about having a poor quality event," Darnell said recently, adding that he plans the renewal of the regatta next year. It is a costly event because it is in New York, he said.
In approaching companies that have contributed to sailing in the past, Darnell found that most were overburdened by commitments they had made to the America's Cup last spring, and to the Olympics this summer.
Darnell and his staff decided to manage the event themselves this year rather than bring in professional fund-raisers. But now his foundation is being criticized by both competitors and former organizers for failing to produce.
Peter Isler, a professional sailor whose team won the 1991 Liberty Cup, had lined up Mount Gay Rum as his personal sponsor for this month's event.
"With two weeks to go, it's really a shocker," Isler said while on vacation in Telluride, Colo. "Being the defending champion, I'd been planning on Liberty Cup for more than a year. It's hard. Mount Gay had already planned for events around town."
 
Money Available or Not?
 Sail Sports International of Westport, Conn., the marketing firm in charge of fund-raising for Liberty Cup last year, was not asked by the festival organizers to be involved again. "I think it's unfortunate that the Liberty Cup was cancelled," Scott MacLeod, president of Sail Sports, said. "I think New York was a great venue, and I think it's unfortunate for sailing and for New York."
The regatta involved four days of match-race sailing in the harbor off Battery Park City.
MacLeod insists that corporate sponsorship is available, despite Darnell's contention that companies are also holding back because of the recession. Sail Sports has secured full sponsorship for the Omega Gold Cup match-racing series next month in Bermuda, MacLeod said, adding that there is a purse of $80,000.
Not all of the sailing's match-racing events involve money. The Knickerbocker Cup, a series sailed out of Port Washington, L.I., last weekend, relied on volunteer support rather than corporate funding. While the Knickerbocker Cup is a lesser event on the match-racing circuit, it is considered a training ground for aspiring match-race sailors.
There has been a surge in match-race events around the world during the last five years. That very fact may spell its downfall, said Gary Jobson of Annapolis, Md., a yachtsman who has competed in the Liberty Cup five times. "More doesn't make it better," Jobson said, noting that it will be hard to put the Liberty Cup back together next year. "It may be that we are seeing the beginning of a saturation in that kind of racing."
 
MAKING WAVES
 The Manhattan Yacht Club is staging the International Yacht Club Challenge in New York Harbor this weekend. Amateur teams from 15 countries are competing on J-24 sailboats in a six-race series that is scheduled to end today off Battery Park City. A team from Belgium, led by the helmsman, TONI VAN DER WALLE, won the event in 1989.

COMPANIES
 
Two Nations, Flight Patterns Indivisible 

A week after a new aviation pact was negotiated between the United States and the Netherlands, an unprecedented global business combination has begun to take shape. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest, in which KLM has a 49 percent stake, asked the Department of Transportation for permission to operate as a single carrier. The department said it favored the idea. The pact, which gives Dutch and American carriers the right to fly anywhere in each other's country, also gives them antitrust immunity. This enables the airlines to set fares jointly, schedule flights, coordinate routes and merge reservation systems. "We are likely to witness the creation of a number of such alliances," said John Dasburg, Northwest's president. Watching is British Airways, which owns a stake in USAir. But Britain has so far refused to negotiate a similar aviation accord.
 
Merck Under Another Name
 
Merck & Company -- one of the world's most powerful drug companies -- also has one of corporate America's most admired names. But recently it said it would create a new division to produce generic drugs under a different name altogether. Merck's new company, to be called West Point Pharma, based in West Point, Pa., will manufacture, at prices rivaling the lowest-cost producers', exact copies of Merck drugs after they have lost their patent protection. Generics now account for 40 percent of all prescriptions. West Point Pharma will begin by marketing diflunisal, a low-priced version of Merck's $100 million seller Dolobid, an analgesic. Next: probably, a version of Merck's $565 million veterinarian drug Ivermectin, which comes off patent in 1997, to be followed by Mevacor, a hugely successful cholesterol-lowering drug with sales of $1.4 billion. Mevacor loses its patent protection in 1999. "It's possible that we would market a generic formulation of all of our products," said John Doorley, a Merck spokesman.

$100 Million for Hats
 
Aside from skullcaps, Easter bonnets and motorcycle helmets, Hat Brands Inc. pretty much makes whatever it takes to cover a person's pate. Not only did the company's founder, Irving Joel, buy bankrupt John B. Stetson for $11 million in cash and the assumption of $3.1 million in debt last year (Stetsons are what the country singer Garth Brooks is partial to), but he also scooped up Resistol from Levi Strauss, giving his company 60 percent of the Western hat market. Hat Brands owns companies that make baseball caps, as well as the very proper Dobbs and Churchill hats. Last week, Hicks, Muse & Company, a leveraged buyout firm, agreed to buy Hat Brands from Mr. Joel for about $100 million. "We have looked at the business going back 10 years, and it seems to be relatively immune to business cycles," said Thomas O. Hicks, chairman.

Boeing's Overseas Order
 
The Boeing Commercial Airplane Company may be laying off workers and slowing down its assembly lines, but it still has a knack for selling those planes. Last week Tarom, the Romanian airline, ordered seven Boeing 737-300's with options on another six of the twin-jet passenger planes. The new planes will replace the carrier's aging fleet of Tupolev TU-154's. Boeing said the order was worth about $470 million.

Before the ink could dry on the Tarom deal, Boeing's marketing mavens sold four 757-200 jetliners to Shorouk Airlines of Egypt with options on four more for about $240 million.

The Shape of a Leaner T.W.A.
 
The Trans World Airlines that will emerge from Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code after it is reorganized and sold to its employees will be smaller, leaner and cheaper to run, the company said last week. T.W.A. said it would trim 12 cities from its routes -- among them Moscow, Istanbul and Palm Springs, Calif. -- and retire 20 antique wide-body Boeing 747's and Lockheed L-1011's. That would shrink its fleet to 167 planes from the current 187. T.W.A. also proposes to cut labor costs by 15 percent through wage, benefit and work-rule concessions previously negotiated with the unions. It expects to trim its daily flights by 10 percent. That leaves a last piece of business to be negotiated: a settlement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation over the company's underfunded pension funds.

Olympia's Bondholders Up Front
 
While Olympia & York, the world's largest property developer, is operating under bankruptcy protection in Canada and Britain, it has avoided that status in the United States. To bolster its American operations, Olympia reached an agreement with bondholders of its huge 55 Water Street complex in Manhattan (right) to take over the building. Olympia -- which owes the bondholders $548 million -- was eager to part with the property because it has a problem with asbestos. The Retirement System of Alabama, the largest investor, will provide up to $21 million to pay for a cleanup and up to $119 million more to buy outstanding bonds. Why? "We think we're somewhere near the bottom of the real estate cycle," said David G. Bronner, chief executive of the system.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Now, the 'Entry Level' Bentley
 
The recession has taken its toll on pricey Rolls-Royce. Not only has its parent company, Vickers P.L.C., put Rolls-Royce on the block -- to no avail -- but sales of its aluminum, lacquer, hand-stitched-leather and walnut land yachts are in a slump. So last week, Rolls introduced a new low-priced Bentley -- the Brooklands. The new "entry level" Bentley is priced to sell at $183,000 -- half the price of the racy Bentley Continental "R," which is turbocharged. "We see it as a 'conquest model,' " said Ian McKay, Bentley's marketing director. "People who perhaps haven't had a Bentley before may feel one is now in reach."
 
Trade Deal Runs Into Trouble
 
President Bush may point to the recently concluded North American Free Trade Agreement as evidence of his Administration's foresight and deal-making prowess, but if the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, has his way, it will go back to the negotiating table. Mr. Gephardt said that the agreement fails to protect workers' rights and that its provisions to protect the Mexican environment are far too lax. Speaking at a gathering sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- which opposes the agreement -- Mr. Gephardt advised the Bush Administration "to cease further efforts to win Congressional approval" of the current agreement. The White House sharply rejected Mr. Gephardt's call for withdrawal.
 
Russia, Japan and the Kuriles
 
When President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia canceled his trip to Japan last week, he cited "obtaining circumstances." But the real reason for the postponement was conflict between the two countries over Japan's insistence that Russia return the Kurile Islands, which it seized after World War II. Unless the islands are returned, Japan is unlikely to increase its direct economic assistance to Russia. "Popular sentiment in Russia is against giving the islands back," said Vladimir Kvint, a professor of international business at Fordham University. "And since Russia is now a democracy, it's that sentiment Yeltsin must listen to."
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Clinton's Answer on Welfare
 
With the nation's welfare rolls at all-time highs -- 4.8 million families now receive Federal assistance, up from just 3.7 million as recently as 1989 -- Gov. Bill Clinton called for "an end to welfare as we know it." In a speech in Atlanta, the Democratic Presidential candidate outlined a sweeping $6 billion-a-year program emphasizing education and job training that would require welfare recipients to go to work in private businesses or in government programs after two years. The program calls for $4 billion to be spent on education and training, and adds $2 billion in tax credits for the working poor. Mr. Clinton's program would increase the amount welfare recipients could save without losing their benefits to $10,000 from $1,000. And how would the program be paid for? Without increasing taxes, Mr. Clinton maintains. Cuts in the military and other spending would get it off the ground, and once welfare recipients start working, their taxes would make the program self-sustaining.
 
Partisan Number Games
 
The two political parties agree that this election is about the economy. But they do not agree on how to read the numbers. When the Congressional Joint Economic Committee said a 30-year-old man with a high-school education earned $3,500 less than a 30-year-old in 1979, the Democratic poll taker Geoffrey Garin said, "Stagnation in wages is at the heart of this election." The Republicans countered that wages for 35-year-olds had risen.
 
Renewal, as Bush Sees It
 
Last week, in an address to the Economic Club of Detroit and in a 29-page report, President Bush outlined what he called an "agenda for American renewal." Its centerpiece is a renewed call for Congress to follow through on about $130 billion in spending cuts he has proposed. "These savings alone could finance an across-the-board rate cut" of one percentage point in income tax rates, a reduction of the small-business tax rate from 15 percent to 10 percent and a reduction of the capital gains tax, Mr. Bush said. Another proposal, sure to be controversial inside the Beltway, calls for trimming 5 percent from the salaries of all Federal employees making $75,000 a year or more. And in a direct challenge to Congress, Mr. Bush said that if the House and Senate cut their operating budgets by one-third, the White House would do the same. His plan, Mr. Bush said, would nearly double the nation's gross domestic product by the end of the decade.
 
Last week, Mr. Bush said: "I went along with one Democratic tax increase and I'm not going to do it again. Ever. Ever." Was that a pledge? Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater backed off: "It wasn't a pledge, no. He was saying, as he's said before, that he wouldn't make that mistake again."

Tug-of-War Over Cable
 
One of the cornerstones of the Reagan Revolution was the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. It took away the right of local governments to regulate prices. Trouble was, cable charges soared. Last week, negotiators in the House and Senate agreed on a measure that would substantially overturn the 1984 act -- requiring the Federal Communications Commission to set rates for basic cable service and regulate the price of cable equipment like remote control devices and transmission boxes. The measure also would require local cable operators to negotiate license fees from local broadcasters to retransmit their signals. The Reagan revolutionaries still in the White House threaten to veto the bill.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Behind the Scenes;
Though Advisers Differ, Clinton's in Tune With All

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If a man is known by the company he keeps, Bill Clinton is clearly a left-leaning liberal. Also, a right-leaning moderate. In foreign policy he is a United Nations multinationalist and an America-first interventionist. In a city where every Democrat suddenly wants to be a "friend of Bill," Mr. Clinton is a man for all advisers.
The Democratic Presidential nominee's economic advisers include a former planning commissioner for Santa Monica, Calif., a city so determinedly of the left that some conservatives call it "the People's Republic of Santa Monica." They also include policy analysts for a group so determinedly of the center that some liberals accuse it of trying to turn Democrats into Republicans. 
 Mr. Clinton's foreign policy advisers range from dovey former Carter Administration figures to adherents of the philosophy of former Senator Henry M. Jackson, the hawkish Democrat from Washington State whose supporters regarded President Carter's approach as softheaded to the point of mush.
In the Democrats' first real season of hope since 1976, all of these people apparently find in the policies and oratory of Mr. Clinton evidence that in his secret heart their party's Presidential nominee is one of them.
It is an entirely understandable impulse, stemming from the endlessly mixed signals that emit from a candidate with something for everyone.
Mr. Clinton is, as he likes to say, "pro-business and pro-labor," "for economic growth and for protecting the environment," "for affirmative action but against quotas," for keeping abortion legal and also for "making it as rare as possible."
He is for a free-trade agreement with Mexico but not necessarily for the one now awaiting Congressional ratification. After Congress voted in January 1991 to authorize President Bush to use force against Iraq, Mr. Clinton said he would have voted with the majority but sympathized with the minority.
The candidate, his advisers and his supporters all argue that this sort of amorphous talk is a result of an intellectually honest search for answers that avoid the polarization that has come to characterize the national debate. They say Mr. Clinton should be regarded as the first Presidential candidate of the post-ideological age.
But others -- most important among them Mr. Clinton's Republican opponents, who have attacked the Democrat as more liberal than he lets on -- see in his blurred outline a familiar creature of American politics: the ideological shape-changer who becomes what each beholder wishes to see.
Whatever the truth, it is undeniable that sharply diverse groups of ideologues claim Mr. Clinton as one of theirs.
"Progressives are getting behind Clinton in a big way because we recognize that he is at least open to being pushed," said Jamin Raskin, who teaches law at the American University in Washington and is a former counsel to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. "There is a sense among progressives that Clinton's election would create a real swing in the political spectrum that would create all sorts of openings for creative policy-making."
Mr. Raskin, and other intellectuals of the Democrats' left, or progressive, wing, generally regard with satisfaction most of the policy choices made by Mr. Clinton and the Democratic Party of 1992. "The cultural issues -- abortion, civil rights, gay rights -- have all been decided on the left," Mr. Raskin said. "The prominence of gay and lesbian rights in the Democratic platform is just extraordinary."
Centrist Democrats beg to differ; Mr. Clinton, they say, belongs to them.
Elaine Kamarck, a leading Democratic policy expert of the Progressive Policy Institute, the Washington-based policy arm of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, of which Mr. Clinton was a founder, gave this reasoning:
"Basically, Democrats all agree that government should be activist. But we who are involved in the new thinking of the party believe in an activist approach that is non-bureaucratic, as distinct from the Great Society liberalism. "We believe in an approach that avoids false choices. I think that from the way Bill Clinton governs, his instincts are very much those of a new Democrat. You can see that in the way he will not cede the family-values debate to the opposition and in the way he stresses personal responsibility and belief in a strong interventionist foreign policy."
 
Economic Plan an Example
 A good example of how these variously striped ideologues find in Mr. Clinton a reasonably comfortable intellectual home can be seen in the formulation of the campaign's central policy document, the economic plan known as "Putting People First." The candidate introduced the plan in a June speech before the United States Conference of Mayors.
Mr. Clinton's more liberal economic advisers maintain that the plan represents a clear triumph of their point of view, with its emphasis on large new programs of Government spending as an "investment" in the future economy over the need for drastically cutting the Federal debt. The more conservative advisers affiliated with the Progressive Policy Institute say the document bears their mark, with its call for large-scale changes in the Federal welfare program stressing the obligations that recipients of tax-dollar largess owe to society.
The plan was largely conceived by Robert Reich and Ira Magaziner, two liberal senior advisers who are both long-time friends of the candidate. An additional but lesser contribution came from Derek Shearer, a former Santa Monica planning commissioner who is also a long-time Clinton friend. The result, says one left-leaning Democratic policy analyst, is "a very impressive document from a progressive point of view."
The analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, called the plan a "clear victory for the progressive side."
"The big choice was whether to stress an investment economy, with increased government spending, which would entail some new taxes, or to focus on reducing the deficit and middle-class tax cuts," the analyst said. "Clinton went with the latter; he made all the big decisions the right way."
 
Rejecting Liberal Thoughts
 But the plan also reflects the thinking of people like Roger Altman, a New York investment banker, and Robert J. Shapiro, a vice president of the Progressive Policy Institute.
Mr. Shapiro rejects the assertions of liberals in slightly annoyed tones. "There has been a lot of this of late, people who fought Bill Clinton all the way and supported an entirely different approach to government now declaring victory," Mr. Shapiro said. "This is simply not true. These people were against our national service plan, against welfare reform, against almost everything we have been proposing for years, all of which is in 'Putting People First.'
"Certainly, there is language in 'Putting People First' that traditionalists can cite as theirs, but structurally the plan is not a traditional Democratic document. It is a program committed to fiscal restraint and based on the view that business, not government, is the source of prosperity."
The development of the plan, according to an account that emerges from interviews with various participants, shows the policy-making process of the campaign to be fairly informal, highly political and directly steered by a candidate whose impulse is for the compromise, not the absolute. It was Mr. Clinton who pushed the plan's development, largely because he felt the political imperative to put forward a comprehensive economic package that would highlight the lack of such a plan on the Republican side.
The initial outline of the plan was drawn by Mr. Reich, Mr. Magaziner, Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Altman and several others and debated and developed in informal working meetings. In these meetings, two of the candidate's chief political strategists, James Carville and George Stephanopoulos, reportedly pushed for more spending, on the ground that it was politically necessary to please major Democratic constituencies, like organized labor, big city mayors and black political groups.
 
Candidate Settled Issue
 Mr. Shapiro was among those who fought to keep spending down. Ultimately the debate was settled by Mr. Clinton, who took part in four or five meetings in which the various options were presented. He ruled on a position that favored spending over deficit-reduction.
Gene Sperling, a 33-year-old former adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, was hired to coordinate the contributions of the senior economic advisers and develop the program's mathematical base. Robert Boorstin, a former New York Times reporter who left to work in Michael Dukakis's campaign and is now Mr. Clinton's deputy director of communications, helped write the final draft in prose accessible to the general public. Mr. Sperling works under Bruce Reed, the campaign's issues director, while Mr. Boorstin works under Mr. Stephanopoulos.
 
Differences on Foreign Policy
 In foreign policy, Mr. Clinton's advisers are as varied as in economics. By all accounts the lead adviser is Anthony Lake, a professor at Mount Holyoke College who was director of the State Department's policy planning staff under President Jimmy Carter. He is joined by Samuel Berger, a Washington lawyer who served directly under Mr. Lake in the Carter Administration.
Mr. Lake and Mr. Berger, both of whom have known Mr. Clinton since they all worked in George McGovern's 1972 Presidential campaign, are regarded unfavorably by interventionist-minded Democrats as proponents of a multilateralist, United Nations-dominated approach.
Warren Christopher, Deputy Secretary of State under President Carter, has also advised Mr. Clinton; Mr. Christopher headed the Vice-Presidential search that resulted in Mr. Clinton's choosing Senator Al Gore of Tennessee as his running mate. Mr. Christopher is likewise seen by some interventionist-minded Democrats as too unwilling to put American interests first and to use force to back up those interests.
But Mr. Clinton's main adviser on Russian affairs, Michael Mandelbaum, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is regarded as more of an interventionist. And Mr. Clinton has also consulted Congressional Democrats like Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn and Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, both of whom are seen as strong interventionists.
Nancy Soderberg, a former aide to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, serves as Mr. Sperling's counterpart on the foreign policy side, coordinating the flow of ideas and arguments from the foreign policy advisers to Mr. Clinton.
Eyeing the diversity of advisers around Mr. Clinton, those who support his candidacy wonder a bit, and some worry.
"We have some very active elements in the party who have a lot to do with the electoral process and who are ground deeply into the philosophy of the party," said John White, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee in the Carter Administration. "These people are all around Clinton, and they are serious liberals.
"And the Democratic Leadership Council people are all around him, too, and they are serious about ultimately moving the party back towards the right. So there is bound to be some conflict at some point. I don't think Clinton will let either side dominate. He'll try to compromise and paper things over. I think he can do it. I hope he can do it. If he can't, we'll get our tails beat, if not now, then in 1996."

HEADLINE: Kansas City, a Midwestern Beauty

BYLINE: By SUZANNE WINCKLER; SUZANNE WINCKLER, based in Omaha, frequently writes about history and natural history in the Midwest.

 BODY:
WILLIAM ROCKHILL Nelson, founder of The Kansas City Star, is credited with saying this about his adopted hometown: "I decided that if I were to live here, the town must be made over." However imperious that might have sounded back then -- and sounds even now -- anyone who has lived or visited Kansas City is a beneficiary of his surety and determination. In the early years of this century, Nelson -- and a number of other equally tenacious and benignly tyrannical entrepreneurs -- went about imposing their own ideal of beauty on Kansas City. Fortunately, their ideal is a hard one to dispute. It is centered on the notion of giving people lots of parks, boulevards, outdoor art and grand public buildings.
What makes their achievement even more noteworthy is that the exigencies of urban life in America in the last few decades, to which Kansas City has not been immune, have failed to mask or tarnish their handiwork. Kansas City is still a beautiful city. To visit is to get a welcome respite from the world of shrinking expectations. 
 The Kansas City I'm talking about is the bigger, more bustling one in Missouri, which converges inconspicuously with its smaller, quieter sister -- Kansas City, Kan. -- along a straight and narrow seam called State Line Road. A taxi driver, when questioned about the boundary situation between the two cities, demonstrated their proximity by straddling his vehicle over the yellow line on State Line Road. "You're on both sides now," he said.
Kansas City, Mo., grew up along the banks of the Missouri River where the river takes a big easterly swing toward its confluence with the Mississippi. Like many cities that developed on the interior watercourses of this continent -- Louisville, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, St. Paul and Jefferson City, to name a few -- Kansas City benefits as much, and maybe more, from its terrain than from its river.
The city sits astride bluffs, huge oceanic swells of earth stacked along the Missouri River that provide outstanding vantages for obtaining the long view. While Kansas City is rightfully known for its barbecue and music, its vistas are equally impressive, and you don't have to clog your arteries or stay up past your bedtime to appreciate them.
An excellent place to get the lay of the land is Liberty Memorial. This elegant 217-foot Art Deco tower, at Main Street and Pershing Road in Penn Valley Park, was built to commemorate casualties of World War I. It stands on the prow of a bluff overlooking downtown Kansas City to the north and is situated at roughly the midway point of a five-mile stretch of the city that will keep a weekend visitor busily entertained with urban pleasures. These include such enduring institutions as Arthur Bryant's Barbecue, the Grand Emporium (noted for the blues), Thomas Hart Benton's home, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, and two shopping areas, City Market and Country Club Plaza.
In Kansas City, Main Street lives up to its name. It is a major north-south thoroughfare that stretches from City Market to and beyond Country Club Plaza, and most of the recommended stops are either on Main Street or just off it.
At Liberty Memorial you can take an elevator to its pinnacle, or simply stand on its grand plaza with the breeze in your face. You will note a number of prominent structures on the downtown horizon to the north. The one with the glittering gold-leaf cupola is the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. The slim, soaring spire is the Kansas City Light and Power Building, another of the city's masterworks from the Art Deco era. But the most conspicuous object in this urbanscape is Union Station. You can't miss it, because it is so big and so lonesome.
If you start to feel too optimistic up here on the bluff, Union Station will bring you back to earth. It is one of the few legacies from Nelson that haven't segued into these times of tight money. Union Station, which has been empty for nearly 10 years, is the subject of litigation between the city and several companies that reneged on redeveloping it. The station is also a topic of heated debate beween preservationists and pragmatists who disagree on whether the building is worth restoring. It is hard to gaze down on Union Station -- the inside is inaccessible -- and imagine what could become of the gorgeous but obsolescent terminal short of the reincarnation of passenger trains.
What has made it to the end of the century -- has even survived the whims of fickle economies -- are Kansas City's parks and public spaces, its broad and winding boulevards, its copious outdoor sculptures and fountains. Whether you go on foot (the recommended way) or by car (that is, one with the windows rolled down), it is virtually impossible to be far from the sound of trickling, spraying, gushing or pulsing water.
The fountains cover the artistic spectrum: from the grandiose classical-style horses and riders splashing amid the geysers of the Plaza Fountain on the esplanade at 47th and Main Streets; to the serenely stylized Art Deco stone statues of a man and woman each perpetually pouring water from vessels in their hands, which stand in the fragrance and texture garden at Loose Memorial Park; to the abstract and ultramodern stainless-steel pipe-and-waterworks sculpture in a downtown pocket park at Walnut and 12th Streets.
Kansas Citians latched on to the concept of public sculpture long before it was fashionable in this country. Consequently, an endeavor that often seems like an afterthought or affectation in many other cities is an intrinsic part of living and doing business in Kansas City. The maintenance and acquisition of public sculpture is a given, like snow removal. Having been at it for so long, Kansas City has all styles of sculpture rather than what is so often the urban norm: a few monstrosities of abstraction purchased when the fancy for public art coincided briefly in the 1970's and early 1980's with procurable money and taxpayer support.
Everyone has his or her favorites. Mine are:
The Indian scout on horseback, a circa 1915 sculpture by Cyrus E. Dallin, standing on the crest of a bluff in Penn Valley Park.
The numerous voluptuous bronzes by the English sculptor Henry Moore, all lounging about on the sweeping lawn of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.
The bronze wild boar on Nichols Road in the Plaza Shopping Center, whose nose you are invited to rub for good luck while also being invited to drop a few coins in the pond at his cloven feet for the Children of Mercy Hospital.
A 1977 sculpture by J. Seward Johnson of a young man eating a hamburger while reading a book at the entrance to the McDonald's at Nichols Road and Jefferson Street. If you get down on your knees and look up at the bronze book cover (an assignment only for the limber), you will discover that it is Milton Friedman's "There's No Such Thing as a Free Lunch." The book is opened to the chapter entitled "Is Money Too Tight?"
What is even more impressive than this concerted effort to put art in public places is the public's concerted effort to get out into these open spaces and enjoy their art. At least on the weekends, people are out in force in Kansas City, pursuing all the ordinary activities -- walking, jogging, biking, shopping, pushing a baby carriage, sitting on a park bench -- that can make life wonderful in a city. Their presence provides an added attraction for those bystanders who watch people as avidly as they watch art.
While surely there are shopping malls somewhere in the metropolitan area, we did not see one. If you hew to the Main Street course, you will be just as fortunate. The city's best shopping areas are at City Market on the north end of Main Street, where shopping is a latter-day take on the age-old bazaar, and further south on Main Street at Country Club Plaza, where art meets commerce.
Country Club Plaza, which Kansas Citians simply call the Plaza, is one of the oldest and most indomitable shopping complexes in America. Begun in 1922, when this area of the city verged on farmland, the Plaza is now the heart of a thriving district of businesses, condominiums, apartments, and hotels. The Plaza makes no bones about being what it has been for seventy years -- an unrepentant orgy of retail opportunities -- but it is also simply an exhilarating place to mill about. Its beguiling Spanish-style buildings, several of which are crowned with exotic domed towers, make the Plaza look more like a rambling palace than a shopping center, and you cannot turn a corner without bumping into a sculpture.
City Market, at Fifth between Main Street and Grand Avenue down by the riverfront, can claim a greater longevity than the Plaza. People have been selling their wares here since the 1850's, and even as Kansas City grew south, the market never missed a beat. City Market offers shopping of an altogether different sort from the Plaza. Here the socioeconomic spectrum of the merchants, their merchandise and the clientele is much broader, and the mercantile emphasis shifts from refined elegance toward willful chaos. For example, at Hung Yuong Market, an Asian grocery and seafood purveyor, you will find underwear in the same aisle as the canned mangoes. On Saturday and Sunday during harvest time, when vendors and shoppers are out in greatest number, and their stalls are stacked with mounds of fresh produce, City Market comes close to resembling an experience in Latin America or Asia, where open-air markets still have primacy and shopping is an art form in itself.
For people who don't shop, or need an occasional break from it, Kansas City has three premier public parks. Penn Valley Park, which encompasses the previously mentioned Liberty Memorial, is a 200-acre expanse of undulating bluffs and ravines that was being talked up as early as 1892 by George E. Kessler, Kansas City's visionary park planner and landscape architect. His Penn Valley Park lies just south of downtown and across from Crown Center, the multipurpose complex of shops, offices, hotels and dwelling places that is also the headquarters of Hallmark Cards.
Considerably south but still an easy drive by most urban standards, is Swope Park. It begins at 63d Street Trafficway and Swope Parkway and rolls south for a thousand-plus acres. Although the huge park was far removed from the city limits when it was dedicated in 1986, Kansas City has grown around it. Swope Park has a zoo, a nature center and Starlight Theater, an open-air amphitheater for summertime music and theater.
Between these two huge parks is a smaller one that is, in part because of its more intimate size, more inviting to foot traffic. Jacob L. Loose Memorial Park is just south of the Country Club Plaza on Wornall Road between 51st and 55th Streets. Loose Park is a pleasant compromise between formal gardens and less tamed expanses of meadows and trees. It is highly recommended for full-bore walking (and running), especially for out-of-town visitors, because its paths, which loop around the perimeter, have that certain symmetry conducive to getting exercise and because the park is near numerous hotels in Country Club Plaza. Loose Park has the distinction of having once been wrapped in saffron nylon by Christo.
A weekend of walking and shopping can leave even the fit a little weary and footsore, which brings us to the subject of footwear. In the courtyard of the Raphael Hotel, one of the popular Country Club Plaza hostelries, there is a reproduction of a Florentine statue. It depicts a young boy sitting with his left leg propped on his right knee and he is bent over examining the bottom of his foot, as if lost in the contemplation of a blister. There is a message in that sculpture. Kansas City is made for walking, and you had better pack a pair of comfortable shoes.
 
 
 
SIGHTS AND SOUNDS NEAR MAIN STREET
Art
 The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, just east of Country Club Plaza at 4525 Oak Street, (816) 561-4000, is one of the jewels of the William Rockhill Nelson legacy. The museum was also endowed substantially by Mary Atkins, a reclusive former schoolteacher.
The Nelson-Atkins's Oriental collection is renowned. It includes ancient ritual and funerary art, Buddhist painting and sculpture, Ming dynasty furniture and Chinese scroll paintings. Also outstanding are the museum's collection of sculpture by Henry Moore, and works by the Missouri artist Thomas Hart Benton (though many of his pieces will be on tour until December). Open Tuesday to Thursday 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., Friday to 9 P.M. and Saturday to 5 P.M.; Sunday 1 to 5 P.M. Admission is  $1 for students and those 6 to 18.
Benton left the hotbed of New York City and the growing Abstract Expressionist movement to return to his home state where until his death at 85 he produced allegorical works in representational style, which are now acclaimed but in their time were out of fashion.
The Thomas Hart Benton Home and Studio, 3616 Belleview Street, (816) 931-5722, where the painter lived from age 50, is a quiet, cloistered compound tucked into a woody, vine-covered lot. The rambling stone house, with its garage-cum-studio, is a charming landmark in the annals of American art history. Open Monday to Saturday 10 A.m. to 4 P.M. and Sunday noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $2; $1.25 for those aged 6 to 12.
 
Eating
 Lamar's Donuts, just east of Main Street at 240 East Linwood Boulevard, (816) 931-5166, is an old filling station retrofitted to produce doughnuts to write home about.
Arthur Bryant's, 1727 Brooklyn Street, (816) 231-1123, has been famous for its barbecue for so long that a reasonable person might assume the reputation is likely to have outstripped reality. It hasn't. For abut $8 a person can visit a shrine -- and feast on a sliced pork sandwich and mountain of fries.
Whistler's Mother, 427 Westport Road, (816) 531-7971, is a coffee shop that serves sweets, coffee and tea upstairs at Whistler's Books.
Cafe Allegro, 1815 West 39th Street, (816) 561-3663, is expensive by Midwestern standards but the intimate, sophisticated setting, well-crafted dishes like yellowfin tuna tartare and French-cut lamb chops with Middle Eastern rice, and the extensive wine list justify the tariff. Dinner for two with wine $125.
 
Late-Nighting
 Once a great jazz city, Kansas City is still a good one. The Grand Emporium, 3832 Main Street, (816) 531-1504, is the place to stay out late. This club is a nationally known venue for musicians, famous and obscure, primarily of the blues persuasion. And the audience is invited to dance to the music.
In operation since 1917, the Mutual Musicians Foundation, 1823 Highland Street, (816) 471-5212, carries on the historic Kansas City jazz tradition with jam sessions after midnight on weekends and sometimes on Saturday afternoons; call first.
Other city spots that feature music and stay open late:
The Phoenix, 302 West 8th Street, (816) 472-0001, a piano bar with an emphasis on jazz.
Javagaia, 2805 Southwest Boulevard, (816) 931-5266, a coffeehouse that leans toward acoustic and world music.
The Tuba, 333 Southwest Boulevard, (816) 471-6510, which books local rhythm and blues and jazz bands and occasionally nationally known performers.
 
Hotels
 On the edge of Country Club Plaza, the Ritz-Carlton, 401 Ward Parkway, (800) 241-3333 or (816) 756-1500, offers double rooms ranging from $149 weedays and $109 weekends.

HEADLINE: Fugitive Leader of Maoist Rebels Is Captured by the Police in Peru

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Sept. 13

 BODY:
In a stunning blow to the guerrilla insurrection that has paralyzed much of Peru and shaken its Government, the police here have captured the movement's leader, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, after a 12-year manhunt.
The capture of Mr. Guzman on Saturday night is seen as Peru's greatest victory in a war that has cost 25,000 lives and an estimated $22 billion in damage. 
 "My turn to lose," Mr. Guzman, the head of the Maoist Shining Path group, reportedly said when the police arrested him at a house in the middle-class Surco neighborhood here.
 
A Dozen Others Captured
 The police said that in that raid and in another nearby they had captured about a dozen high-ranking members of a group formally called the Communist Party of Peru but more widely known as Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path.
The group's 12-year insurrection is by far the largest and most violent in Latin America. Its challenge to the Peruvian Government has provoked widespread concern in the region, and its control of coca-growing regions in Peru has complicated antidrug efforts by the United States and other countries.
The movement, which has an estimated 5,000 fighters and thousands of other supporters, was born in 1970 in the Andean city of Ayacucho, where Mr. Guzman was a philosophy professor in the 1960's and 70's. In 1980 it began its armed insurgency. [Page A8.]
It has spread to all of Peru's provinces in 12 years of almost uninterrupted growth, fed in part by the wide gulf between rich and poor and in part by Shining Path's emphasis on giving power to indigenous people, the great majority of the population, at the expense of the elite of Spanish heritage.
"We are in front of a monster," President Alberto K. Fujimori told Peruvians tonight as state television showed a videotape of the imprisoned guerrilla leader standing shirtless.
In other prison footage, Mr. Guzman stood impassively behind bars, his right fist raised. In another scene, the bearded and bespectaled leader appeared with seven other Shining Path prisoners, several of them striking the air with their fists.
"I don't have the slightest doubt that we will apply the maximun punishment," Peru's President said, referring to a man he called "a war criminal" and "a malevolent genius."
Since seizing authoritatian powers last April, Mr. Fujimori has decreed that jailed terrorist leaders will be tried by military judges on treason charges. In Peru, a treason conviction can bring a life sentence or the death penalty.
"I have promised to end terrorism by 1995," said the President. "But let's not crow victory. Nothing would be more ominous for Peruvians than to lower their guard now."
Several analysts predicted today that while the arrests would increase Mr. Fujimori's short-term popularity, they would not spell the end of the insurgency.
Within Shining Path, the 57-year-old Mr. Guzman enjoys virtually godlike stature. His followers acclaim him as "the fourth sword of Marxism" and his writings are held to be on a par with those of Marx, Lenin and Mao.
"They have captured the godhead -- it is like capturing an Inca," said Paul L. Doughty, a University of Florida anthropology professor and expert on Shining Path.
In Lima, which bears the scars of repeated Shining Path attacks, including a car-bombing campaign in July, there was jubilation today.
"Public Enemy No. 1 Arrested" read a headline in a special edition of the newspaper Expreso. "Abimael Guzman is captured; the most wanted murderer of the century arrested."
 
Rebel Attacks on the Rise
 Expreso said that Mr. Guzman was captured as he met with other members of Shining Path's central committee to plan an October bombing campaign named "Operation Conquer Lima."
Guerrilla attacks in the capital and elsewhere in the nation of 23 million people have intensified this year. Mr. Fujimori cited the conflict when he suspended constitutional rule on April 5. He made the capture of Mr. Guzman a top priority.
"The arrest is going to greatly strengthen Fujimori politically," said Nelson Manrique, a Lima historian who has studied Shining Path. "If the Government capitalizes on this success, it could win a majority in the Assembly."
Mr. Fujimori hopes that two slates he is backing will win the Nov. 22 election for a new Congress, a body that is also to function as a constitutional convention.
In April, Mr. Fujimori closed Peru's courts and Congress, charging that they were obstacles to his war on terrorism. In public opinion polls, his popularity surged to 85 percent, and then fell back to about 60 percent last week.
"His popularity is fragile," said Mr. Doughty, the University of Florida professor. "If Fujimori makes too much of this, it could be disastrous. Where is he going to come up with one million jobs? He is not out of the woods by any means."
Peru is in deep recession and its economic problems have been compounded by the cost of the war against Shining Path and the damage the group has inflicted. Bombing targets often include bridges, rail lines and power installations.
Mr. Guzman's capture was the second major anti-insurgency victory for the Government this year. Three months ago the police arrested Victor Polay, the leader of Peru's other guerrilla group, the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
The elusiveness of Mr. Guzman, whom officials said was being held at the headquarters of the anti-terrorist agency here, had become legendary in Peru over the last decade.
In June 1990, he was nearly captured at a Lima safe house, but slipped away. When the police broke in, they found only his reading glasses and medication.
 
A History of Violence
 In another raid in Lima, in January 1991, the police found a videotape showing the Shining Path leader mourning at the funeral of his wife, Augusta La Torre. He and 14 other Shining Path leaders were dressed in collarless jackets of the type popular in China under Mao Zedong.
The movement has been marked by a high degree of violence, which in turn has provoked harsh measures by the security forces.
In a recent example, seven people were killed at a gasoline station near here on Sept. 5. Eight guerrillas robbed the station, apparently to draw the police. When they fled, they left behind a van. When the police arrived and opened the door of the van, a bomb exploded, killing the 7 and seriously injuring 13.
Car bombings in Lima this summer, in response to Mr. Fujimori's crackdown, caused scores of casualties and widespread damage.
Although Shining Path followers revere Mr. Guzman, they have said that the struggle will survive him.
"This will demonstrate to the world that what we have in Peru is a peoples' war, not a central committee's war," said Adolfo Olaechea, a director of the Sol Peru Committee, a London-based group that supports the rebels. "The war has more to do with a class struggle than with personalities."
Several analysts said the Government had strengthened its hand by capturing the Shining Path leader alive, rather than dead.
"Peru is a country with martyrs, not with heroes," Mr. Doughty said. "All the national icons are martyrs. The Government has to take care of his capture, in order not to martyr him."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Anxious in His Lead, Clinton Fights to Run Race His Way

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Sept. 13

 BODY:
Part of the ritual of Presidential campaigns is the ceremonial boarding and unboarding of the plane, with the candidate walking past a gantlet of reporters shouting questions on the issues of the day. A relaxed candidate will stop and take a few. Gov. Bill Clinton strides right on by these days.
One week after Labor Day, with only seven weeks to go until the election, this is a tense and careful campaign. Mr. Clinton has retained his lead in the polls, even enlarged it in the Newsweek survey released Saturday. But every day is a struggle to keep the election focused where he wants it focused: on the ailing economy and on President Bush's shortcomings, rather than on the character issues that the Bush campaign wants front and center, notably Mr. Clinton's shifting accounts of his draft record.
 
Formidable Hurdles Remain
 
 His aides call it staying "on message": a manufacturing-jobs program last Tuesday, welfare reform on Wednesday, values on Friday, more jobs proposals this week. "What people want is fairly basic," said Stan Greenberg, the polltaker for the Clinton campaign. "They know they don't want Bush, and they want to know where Bill Clinton wants to take the country, and that's what we're laying out. It's a meat-and-potatoes election."
The economy played a big role in the results of the Newsweek poll, which showed Mr. Clinton running 15 points ahead of the President, 53 percent to 38 percent. Seventy percent of those surveyed disapproved of the way Mr. Bush was handling the economy; 47 percent thought Mr. Clinton would handle it better. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
But while the race may seem stable in the polls now, Clinton aides say that much of the campaign's future is outside their control. The real television advertising has yet to begin. The draft issue continues to percolate, despite Mr. Clinton's attempts to cast it as settled. And the debates, assuming the Bush campaign ultimately agrees to a schedule, are almost certain to have an enormous impact. Mr. Clinton spent much of the past week preparing for them, and aides say he will be in East Lansing, Mich., on Sept. 22, the date set for the first debate by the Commission on Presidential Debates, regardless of where Mr. Bush is.
It is a stage of the election where the risks and the rewards are great for a challenger like Mr. Clinton. He told a crowd on Saturday night that he sometimes felt bewildered by how far his campaign has come, a standard political gesture of humility but one with some credibility, given Mr. Clinton's experience with near political death in the primaries. The atmospherics on the trail these days underscore the stakes: the heckling is tougher, the cheers more impassioned.
A group of Bush-Quayle supporters, fresh-faced young people who said they were from local colleges, greeted Mr. Clinton at an event in a leafy suburb in Virginia on Saturday night. "Hey, hey, ho, ho, draft dodgers got to go!" they chanted as his car rolled past the placards asserting, "Clinton You're No Patriot." They also chanted the distillation of another line of Republican attack: "Failed Governor, Small State!"
At his speech on values at Notre Dame on Friday, Mr. Clinton was interrupted by the shouts of a handful of anti-abortion demonstrators almost every time he talked about the needs of children: "What about the babies, Bill?" they yelled. "What about the babies?"
But Mr. Clinton's supporters seem equally intense, energized, it seems, by the Republican convention and its numerous attacks on the nominee and his wife, Hillary. At the University of Notre Dame on Friday, the hall erupted in sustained cheers when Mrs. Clinton was introduced, a kind of determined assault on the scattered boos in the room; afterwards, many young women pushed to the front of the crowd, trying to get a close-up look at her, shouting, "Hillary! Over here, Hillary!"
His aides say he is trying to step up to the moment, to articulate a vision, to be big enough, in other words, for the voters to see him as something more than not Bush. Clinton aides bristle at the rumble of criticism in recent days from pundits and politicians that Mr. Clinton is sitting on his lead, being too cautious, not risking or reaching or working enough. "The object is to win, not to kill him," snapped Paul Begala, a Clinton aide, on the campaign plane the other day.
 
Detente on Issues Criticized
 But Mr. Clinton, in the way he handles many issues, often feeds the criticism that he is excessively cautious and too political, or, in the words of Mr. Bush, "waffling" in a way that is unacceptable in a President. This is sometimes applied to his position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Clinton says he supports in principle but is withholding final judgment on until he reads the fine print.
It is sometimes applied to his solicitous courtship of a wide range of constituents. On Saturday, for example, he attended a rally on the Washington Mall with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, which was intended to honor black families and kick off a voter registration drive; a crab feast in the Virginia suburbs, and, finally, a fund raiser at the Middleburg, Va., estate of Pamela Harriman, deep in horse country.
But the campaign seems more sensitive to the charge of excessive politics when it is applied to Mr. Clinton's account of how he managed to avoid the draft in the Vietnam War, which his Republican critics assert has changed several times depending on the audience and the time frame.
The Governor blew up at reporters who asked about it last Monday; since then, his aides have calmly stated that he has talked about it quite enough. Publicly, they dismiss the notion that the Republican emphasis on this issue in recent days has them worried
"I think whatever people think about Bill Clinton and the draft, they've already made up their mind," said Mickey Kantor, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. "There doesn't appear to be any movement one way or the other, based on the recent Bush-Quayle discussion of it."
 
Focus on the Economy
 Still, a campaign that watched its lead disappear in New Hampshire, when charges that he had manipulated his draft status first broke, can hardly stay sanguine about it today.
Mr. Clinton, campaigning this weekend, kept his focus on the economy, on a mocking assault on President Bush's economic proposals and on what he asserted was a dark Republican plot to win the election by dividing the nation. Saturday night, in the backyard of a home in Falls Church, Va., he cut loose, ridiculing Mr. Bush as a man who promises to "never, ever" raise taxes again, then sends his press secretary out to declare "that was not a pledge."
He compared Mr. Bush to the sinner who contends, "the devil made me do it," when he blames Congress for forcing him into the 1990 budget agreement that included tax increases. "They made me do it," he said, his voice edging into a whine. "What do you expect? I'm just the President."
Then he segued, reaching for a larger appeal: "It's our responsibility to bring the reality back into this campaign, and to bring the hope back into this campaign, and to keep people's visions on the future. We are better than this. We are better than this. And we can do better than this. The only way we will not prevail is if one more time we become divided or distracted, if one more time we allow fear to dominate hope."
In Falls Church, and at every event n recent days, he talked of the number of days remaining, just over 50 now. But he did so almost grimly, warily, like a man who sees a finish line, but one so distant it gives little solace.

HEADLINE: MILITARY FLIES AID TO RAVAGED ISLAND

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Skimming low over the calm blue Pacific and over acres of roofless houses and broken palm trees, military C-130 relief flights landed in a daylong stream today on the lush tropical island of Kauai, forming the only link to the outside world for residents devastated by Hurricane Iniki on Friday.
Loaded with generators and communications equipment as well as military rations and bottled water, the relief flights brought the essentials of daily life to 55,000 residents and thousands of stranded tourists. And today commercial airlines began ferrying tourists off the island. 
 A spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency said 10,000 homes on the island had sustained major damage and up to 8,000 people were staying in shelters set up by the Red Cross. Two deaths and 98 injuries were reported on Kauai, and one death on the main island of Oahu.
 
Sounds of Hammering
 The spokeswoman, Linda Sacia, said the storm had destroyed the island's macadamia nut crop and other crops that form a mainstay of the island's economy. She said it also knocked out Kauai's water and power systems, and local officials said it would take weeks to restore them.
Across the island, fields of sugar cane were flattened and an estimated 90 percent of utility poles were toppled by the 160-mile-an-hour winds. The sounds of hammering and sweeping could be heard from village to village today.
Broken palm fronds and thousands of roof tiles carpeted the ground along with scattered white and yellow plumeria flowers, oranges and jackfruit.
A towering brick smokestack at the Lihue Plantation, the island's largest sugar refinery, was snapped in half.
"There's pain, a lot of pain," said Ken Cagulada, who lost his home in the storm. Mr. Cagulada, a foreman with a roofing company, said: "We're roof folks. We've got a lot of work now, but it's more sorrow than work."
Gov. John Waihee 3d called Hurricane Iniki "probably the worst disaster we've ever had in the state of Hawaii."
Kauai's Mayor, JoAnn Yukimura, estimated the damage to the island at $1 billion.
On an island where it is common to say that "everybody knows everybody," many residents affected by the storm were expected to find help and shelter with friends and relatives.
Mike Allen, a spokesman for the emergency management agency, which was criticized for responding slowly to Hurricane Andrew in Florida last month, had begun "a full-court press" here.
He said he was not aware that the agency had modified its operations following the criticism about its Florida response.
Some officials from the agency were on the ground even before the hurricane struck on Friday afternoon, and the agency director, Wallace Stickney, arrived Saturday.
State officials voiced concern that the storm could hurt the state's tourism industry, which has already been in a slump and which suffered a severe setback after Hurricane Iwa 10 years ago.
"The sun is shining and visitors are enjoying what they came to Hawaii to do," said Stanley Hong, the president of the Hawaii Visitors Bureau. He said his office was hurrying to produce what he called a "video news release" to assure potential visitors that they could still enjoy themselves here.
But on Kauai, where rations were short at the luxury hotels, tempers were becoming short among stranded tourists.
"Why are we angry?" asked Helen Figura, a guest at a luxury hotel who is visiting from Anaheim, Calif. "Because we don't have nothing to eat. There's no electricity, no power, no phone, no nothing." Rather than lying on the beach, she had spent Saturday afternoon standing in a line with her husband at one of the few operating grocery stores on the island to buy extra food and water.
Maj. Wayne Yoshioka, a spokesman for the Hawaii National Guard, said that 10 C-130 aircraft and a fleet of military helicopters were flying around-the-clock relief missions and that Guardsmen were providing security around the island. There were some isolated reports of looting.
He said stranded tourists could join homeless residents at shelters if they needed extra rations.
He said Hawaiian Airlines would soon begin ferrying tourists on special flights from the island, where the airport has been closed because of damage to the control tower.
 
Extensive Erosion
 Despite the difficulties, the storm caused remarkably little injury or loss of life. Hospital officials on Kauai said that of the 98 people hurt on the island only seven were hospitalized, none with major injuries.
But devastation was widespread. "The destruction was island-wide," said Mayor Yukimura after flying over Kauai in a helicopter on Saturday. "Huge chunks of shoreline along the Na Pali coast were washed away and there is a lot of erosion. It's like the coast aged a century in one day."
One resident, 68-year-old Cecilio Dacay, described the destruction in words echoed by many of his neighbors. "This," he said, "used to be a beautiful place. Now it seems like a war zone."
Surveying the remains of his garden, he pointed to an acre of barren soil and said: "Ginger, eggplant, cabbage, lettuce, carrots, papaya, bananas, tangerines, onions, corn, orchids, you name it, I had it.
"Its all gone," he said. "But the people are still here. That's wonderful. We've just got to start all over again."
After surveying the island from a helicopter on Saturday, Governor Waihee also spoke of the power of nature and the resilience of the human spirit.
"There is not a single spot on the island that has escaped damage," he said. "I was struck by the way nature had altered herself," leveling vegetation and reshaping the coastline.
In the Poipu area along the southern coast, for example, where the storm swept ashore, officials reported that the "debris line" on trees and buildings from the waves was 30 to 40 feet above the ground.
But the Governor also noted that once the winds had died, residents had emerged from their homes and were joining together to rebuild.
"It's heartening to see people pulling back together," he said.
Gas, electric and telephone workers were busy today across the island but officials said full services would not be restored for weeks.
Norman Ahu, a telephone company technician visiting the island on Saturday, said it would take at least two weeks to restore full service. Claire Morris, a power company spokeswoman, said full power would not be restored for at least a month.
Relief flights were arriving almost hourly. Two of the flights ferried 51 dialysis patients from the island so that they could continue their treatments where electric power is available.
Major Yoshioka of the National Guard said that about 300 troops were assisting in the relief operations on the island and that generators had been distributed to hospitals and police stations.
Batteries and household supplies were being shipped in along with 1.2 million military food rations, he said.
For the longer run, said Mr. Allen, the emergency agency spokesman, procedures were being put in place for residents to apply for grants of up to $1,500 and for rental or home repair assistance for up to 18 months.
The storm's fatalities included a 91-year-old woman, who was killed when her house collapsed in the winds, and a 76-year-old man who was killed by flying debris.
A boy was killed in a fire on the main island, Oahu, in a fire that officials said was caused by a candle that was used when the storm caused a power outage.
Oahu, 80 miles to the southeast and home to 800,000 people, mostly in Honolulu, was spared the brunt of the storm and suffered relatively light damage estimated by officials at $2.5 million.
"It was very scary, very, very scary," said George Kawakami, who is the field representative for Senator Daniel K. Inouye.
"When the wind picked up some roofing and slammed a tree into the side of my home, I wondered why I didn't go to a shelter," he said. "I guess it's the same reason I live here in Kauai. It's my home."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Bush Voices Sympathy
 By Reuters -- As residents of Kauai began digging out from a hurricane that devastated their island, President Bush pledged yesterday to "stand by" the people of Hawaii after its worst storm this century.
Mr. Bush, speaking before leaving Washington for a three-day West Coast campaign trip, said, "Our hearts go out to people of Hawaii and we pledge to stand by them, of course, in their hour of need."
He said he had no plans to visit Hawaii.
Mr. Bush, who was criticized by some officials for what they called a slow response to Hurricane Andrew in South Florida, declared most of Hawaii a disaster area on Saturday as the National Guard rushed aid to Kauai.

HEADLINE: GERMANY PROMISES INTEREST-RATE CUT TO REVIVE GROWTH

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Sept. 13

 BODY:
After days of turmoil on European money markets, Germany promised tonight to lower its high interest rates, a move that is expected to strengthen the slipping dollar and take pressure off the troubled economies of Britain, France and other European countries.
Word of Bonn's decision, announced by Prime Minister Giuliano Amato of Italy in Rome and the European Community in Brussels, immediately drew sighs of relief from Paris and London. France and the Netherlands are expected to respond by lowering their interest rates, making it easier for businesses to borrow money and thus inject some sense of movement into the European economy. 
 Significantly, Germany's decision, made in tandem with an Italian agreement to devalue its currency, was announced just a week before the French vote on a referendum on European political and economic unity. For months, Germany has resisted pressure from its allies and trading partners to cut its interest rates, and only last week, the president of the Bundesbank said the bank saw "no room for maneuver to lower rates." [News analysis, page D2.]
 
Persuasion for the French
 Polls have indicated that the vote in France will be close. Some people interpreted the German decision -- which comes after months of criticism by its allies -- as an attempt to persuade French voters to support the treaty on European union. After voters in Denmark voted against the treaty in a referendum in June, many European political leaders and economists said a rejection by the French would end the push for European unity and disrupt the region's economy.
"The opportunities created by the will of the Bundesbank to lower its lending rates are of considerable significance," Finance Minister Michel Sapin of France said after the German announcement. The German promise, he said, "demonstrated the true solidarity of Germany towards its European partners and opened the way to an easing of interest rates in Europe, which is necessary to support growth and employment."
 
White House Reaction
 In Washington, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in a statement: "We welcome the action taken this weekend to realign the European Monetary System, and we are especially pleased that the Bundesbank intends to reduce interest rates Monday morning. This is a positive development for world markets."
The German decision is expected to buoy the dollar because the chief reason for the dollar's weakness has been the huge spread between the Federal Reserve's low interest rates and the Bundesbank's high ones. The high rates attract many investors. With lower German interest rates, fewer investors will be buying marks, and that currency is likely to drop in value against the dollar, and other currencies as well.
[In Monday trading in Asia and Australia, the dollar was up sharply against the mark.]
Tonight's move represented a reversal of European monetary policy, just a week after European finance ministers said at a meeting in Bath, England, that they would not realign the currencies. The looming vote in France, as well as the continuing slide of the lira, apparently produced the turnabout.
The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said in a statement tonight that it would announce cuts in its official interest rates on Monday. It provided no details of the extent to which interest rates would be reduced. The announcement of the pending cut was itself extraordinary; the Bundesbank hardly ever discloses a rate change in advance.
But even nations outside the European Monetary System, like Finland and Sweden, have been feeling the strain of high German interest rates. Sweden, for instance, was forced last week to raise its inter-bank interest rate to 75 percent to protect its krona against the mark.
Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany said the decision to devalue the lira had been reached unanimously by the European Community's finance ministers and central bank governors.
"This decision will contribute to overcoming the tensions which have arisen on European foreign exchange markets, especially in the last few days," Mr. Waigel told reporters on the North Sea island of Sylt.
Before agreeing to lower interest rates, Germany insisted that Italy devalue the lira by 7 percent against other European currencies, a step that is expected to calm the markets. But the lira's devaluation is expected to reinforce the perception of Italy as the economic sick man of Europe.
"The results should have positive effects for Europe and the world and could also turn out positively for Italy." Mr. Amato said.
In Britain, Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said the value of the pound against the mark would not be affected. "We particularly welcome the intention of the Bundesbank council to cut its official interest rates in order to reduce strains" within the European monetary system, he said.
European Community exchange rates are governed by a system that sets upper and lower limits for currency fluctuations and obliges central banks to intervene to support weak currencies.
Technically, the devaluation of the lira was the result of a 3.5 percent upward revaluation of other European currencies against the theoretical accounting unit, the European Currency Unit, and a 3.5 percent devaluation of the lira against it.
Before the currency markets closed on Friday, the lira had slipped below its designated floor against the mark. An increase in Italian interest rates, the purchase of $1.5 billion of lira by the Bank of Italy and costly intervention by other European central banks failed to halt the collapse.
 
Fundamental Weakness
 The devaluation of the lira is also likely to be interpreted here as a long-overdue recognition of Italy's fundamental economic weakness stemming from the nation's huge budget deficit -- Europe's largest in absolute terms. The deficit could reach $150 billion by the end of the year. That represents about 11 percent of Italy's gross domestic product, the second highest percentage in Western Europe, after Greece.
While it is unclear how large the German interest rate reductions will be, if they are more than of token size, they could counter the mark's recent strength against European currencies and the dollar.
 
A Few Complaints
 Not everyone was delighted. Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank, said: "The Bundesbank has let itself be blackmailed. This is sensational that for the first time, they have let their independence be compromised. This clearly has come from political pressure."
Prime Minister Amato said Germany had been pressing for several weeks to revalue the mark, while Italy had been campaigning for lower interest rates.
"We have acted in a strong European spirit and our Government has succeeded in finally allowing German interest rates to fall," he told a news conference at which, for domestic political reasons, he sought to salvage some honor from a move many Italians are certain to see as humiliating.
Despite the expectation among many Europeans of more stable money markets, some people remain skeptical of the impact of a German rate cut, particularly if the Bundesbank makes only marginal cuts in interest rates or if French voters reject the Maastricht Treaty on European political and economic union.
"I hope we can now go back to the long period of monetary stability we have known," Finance Minister Phillipe Maystadt of Belgium said. "Of course, all this depends on the hypothesis that the French do not vote against Maastricht."

HEADLINE: To Fill a Shortage of Doctors, Town Nurtures 2 of Its Own

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Colo.

 BODY:
When the Pilmentel and Perez families moved here from Mexico in the 1970's, there was a shortage of manual laborers for the kind of dirty, back-breaking, low-paying field work that seemed reserved for those who spoke Spanish.
Like many rural towns, Burlington today faces a worker shortage at the opposite end of the economic and social spectrum: physicians. In the past four years, Burlington has spent $50,000 on a campaign to recruit a doctor or two, but none would settle in this 3,000-person town, which is a flat spot near the Kansas border and not much else. 
 The town ultimately found a solution in its own backyard: It persuaded a wealthy resident to finance the medical school costs of two Burlington High School graduates in exchange for their promise to return home.
Burlington now looks forward to the day when "Dr. Sacramento Pilmentel" and "Dr. James Perez," the sons of field workers and dishwashers, come home to hang out their shingles. The two young men have just begun their first year at the University of Colorado Medical School.
"My son will help the town," a beaming Israel Pilmentel, a 46-year-old farm hand, said through an interpreter. His 14-year-old son Jerardo added his own comment: "Man, I am so proud."
The town's newspaper will run a regular feature that keeps up with the progress of the medical students. "This town is real proud of these kids," said John Hudler, the news editor at The Burlington Record.
 
From Field to Field
 "We want people to know how things are going for them and their families," he said. "That way, when they come home for Christmas, people can ask them about classes and life at school. And by the time they've finished up, people here will still have a connection to them. They won't be strangers."
Born in Mexico to migrant workers, the young men spent their early years traveling to fruit and vegetable fields in California, Florida and Colorado with their families. They usually stayed in beaten-up trailers, although Sacramento Pilmentel recalls a stint of staying in an old Buick.
Their fathers worked in the sugar beet fields here and eventually found permanent jobs as farm hands. Their mothers work as dishwashers in local restaurants. Neither of the young men spoke English when they came to Burlington. As a child, Mr. Perez said he knew, "My father -- the Mexicans -- did work no one else was willing to do."
A Spanish teacher at the high school would come to the elementary school to help sometimes, but mostly they learned the language on their own.
"We watched a lot of 'Sesame Street,' " said Mr. Perez.
For a time, the two young men doubted they would even go to college, much less medical school. In the summer after graduation from Burlington High School in 1988, Mr. Perez was working on a farm, and Mr. Pilmentel had gone to the oil fields of Wyoming in search of work. They told their parents they would probably not be going to college. They could not afford it.
 
2-Person Support Group
 But Colorado State awarded them scholarships, and the young men nervously went off to campus. "Most kids had parents who had gone to college, or older siblings, and they knew what to expect," said Mr. Perez. "If we hadn't had each other, we probably would have put our backpacks in the car and gone home."
The year the boys went to college the town began searching for a doctor because two of the town's physicians retired. Burlington could have applied for a Federal program that assigns doctors to rural regions, in exchange for forgiveness of loans. But the town was skeptical. Those doctors often leave as soon as their obligations are fulfilled.
The town was unaware that James Perez, who is married and the father of a three-month-old boy, had been accepted to medical school. But news spread quickly when he came to the Bank of Burlington last winter in search of a hefty loan.
Despite the common view that scholarship money is always available for bright minority students, officials at the Colorado Medical School said the pool of financial aid had been inadequate for several years.
 
Not a Marcus Welby
 The Burlington loan officer, Charles Baker, called Mr. Hudler at the newspaper and asked, "Do you suppose there is anything we can do for him?"
Mr. Hudler met with Mr. Perez. "If we paid for your schooling," he asked, "would you come back here?"
At first, Mr. Perez was skeptical that an offer would be made. Hispanic people account for less than 10 percent of the town's population. He wondered whether they might have been looking for a doctor that looked more like Marcus Welby. "I didn't think Burlington would want me, you know, being a minority," he said.
One local resident assured Mr. Perez: "Look, if you have a good bedside manner, it won't matter if you're 10 different colors and striped to boot."
Vayo Rodriguez, a 31-year-old who works for the city's electric department and is a friend of the Pilmentel family, said the majority of the townspeople were fair-minded. And the others? "Well, they're learning something, aren't they," he said, and smiled broadly. "They're about to turn around and see that one of those people -- the ones who are below them -- has gotten as high in this town as you can get."
 
'Mr. Potter' Steps In
 As products of the working class, the young men said, they will be able to relate to patients in a way that other doctors might not. "Most doctors are from pretty educated, well-to-do backgrounds, and the patients know it," Mr. Pilmentel said. "But if a concrete worker or a welder or a farm worker comes into the office, I'll be able to say, 'Hey, I can relate to what you're doing.' And it will give the patients some connection."
As a gruff old man with plenty of power and money in a small town, Harold McArthur is a kind of warm-hearted version of Mr. Potter in "It's a Wonderful Life."
"I've been lucky," said Mr. McArthur, 82, as he sat near a sign on the wall about shooting salesmen and spat tobacco juice. "I've made potfuls of money, and I'm going to spend it."
He has a long list of beneficence and is also executor of a charitable trust. He was approached about the idea of using trust money for the young men.
"I like this idea so much I'll pay for it myself," he said.
He has earmarked about $30,000 a year for the two students. But if that isn't enough, townspeople say they will get the money somehow.
"It's going to be like some corny Norman Rockwell painting," said Mr. Hudler, the newspaper editor. "This whole town is going to pull together."
Before the agreement was made, Mr. McArthur wanted to meet the boys at his farm implements dealership. A sometimes cantankerous man, Mr. McArthur has been known to have physically removed a salesman or two in his time. As he sat in work trousers behind a cluttered desk, he asked the young men some hard questions.
 
Sealed by a Handshake
 "What really turned me on about these boys," said Mr. McArthur, who came from an impoverished family of 12 children, "was the way they want to learn, really learn."
Mr. Hudler had gone along to the meeting with a contract that would legally bind the young men to return to Burlington.
"Nope, I don't do business that way," said Mr. McArthur, who simply wanted to shake hands on the deal.
"Pretty cool," said Mr. Pilmentel. And they shook.
To hear the townspeople, the arrangement is the most creative idea in Burlington since the 1950's, when a local farmer decided to arrange and attend his own funeral. He thought it was a shame for eulogies to be wasted on the dead. So the farmer, who was in his 70's, sat in his casket and listened to people mourn and talk about what a splendid fellow he was. Life magazine even sent a photographer.
"This whole darned thing is just wonderful," said Barry Hinkhouse, a farmer who employs James Perez's father. "They'll be such great role models -- for everyone."
Two years ago, Mr. Pilmentel and his brother David spent the summer at a meat packing plant in Dodge City, Kan., to raising money to send David to mechanic's school in Denver.
"He's about to get a job," said Mr. Pilmentel, "and then he's going to help me out."

HEADLINE: U.S., Mindful of Setbacks in Past, Offers Guarded Praise of Capture

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD R. KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Long frustrated in its efforts to develop an effective policy toward Peru, the Bush Administration responded today to the capture of the rebel leader Abimael Guzman Reynoso with a mixture of satisfaction and caution.
Some officials compared the arrest of the Shining Path leader with the capture of Che Guevara, the Marxist revolutionary who was tracked down and executed in Bolivia in 1967. They expressed hope that Mr. Guzman's capture would turn the tide in the losing war against the Peruvian rebels and the drug traffickers who finance them. 
 But Administration officials also noted that Shining Path has shown enormous resiliency in recent years and has repeatedly spirited its members out of prisons. Also tempering the urge to celebrate was the mixed outcome of the Administration's fitful efforts to help fight Shining Path while pressing President Alberto K. Fujimori to reverse his seizure of near-dictatorial powers and improve his human rights record.
 
Rebels' Link to Drug Traffic
 In suspending the Constitution on April 5, Mr. Fujimori said he needed untrammeled authority to fight the rebels and drug traffickers. Shining Path's base of operations in the Upper Huallaga Valley is the richest area of coca cultivation in the world, and the group taxes and protects growers and cooperates with traffickers to finance its operations.
Peru supplies the raw material for more than half the cocaine consumed in the United States. In recent months, the Administration's concern about Shining Path has deepened with reports that its operations are spreading into neighboring Bolivia.
"These people direct the most violent and vicious terrorist group that has ever existed in Latin America," the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, said today.
He predicted that the arrests would "provide the Peruvian Government and people with what they need most in this battle: some sense of hope and confidence."
Mr. Aronson said it was too early to tell whether the capture would help restore a sense of legitimacy to the Peruvian Government or help mend relations between Lima and Washington, which have been strained since Mr. Fujimori dissolved the legislature, the courts and the Constitution.
But the Assistant Secretary of State hinted that a better relationship had been in the making since Mr. Fujimori pledged to hold new legislative elections in November and to allow observers of the Organization of American States to monitor the polling.
United States officials refused to say whether American intelligence or military personnel were in any way involved in the events that led to Mr. Guzman's arrest.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, said it was "certainly possible" that the United States had provided some intelligence assistance in the operation, although military aid to Peru was suspended last spring.
Mr. Torricelli predicted that the capture of Mr. Guzman would help ease tensions between Lima and Washington. "I say this with great reservation, but this represents somewhat of a vindication for Fujimori's actions," the New Jersey Democrat said.
Even before Mr. Fujimori seized emergency powers in April, Congress had held up Administration efforts to train Peruvian military units in anti-drug operations and had delayed economic aid aimed at weaning local economies from dependence on coca growing. Many Democrats warned of an American military entanglement similar to the one in Vietnam.
Mr. Fujimori's suspension of the Constitution led to the cancellation of $167 million in economic aid and the withdrawal of 20 advisers training Peruvian police in operations against drug traffickers. Relations deteriorated further when a Peruvian Air Force jet opened fire on an American transport plane involved in anti-drug reconnaissance on April 24, causing the death of one crewman.
The Bush Administration contends that the Peruvian people will only follow a democratic government in the long run. Today United States officials agreed that Mr. Fujimori's standing would be bolstered by the capture of the terrorist leader but said it was unclear what policies he would pursue from a position of greater strength.
Among the human rights abuses attributed to the Peruvian authorities in recent years are sporadic mass killings in Indian communities and torture in prisons.

In a move that should bolster the beleaguered dollar and ease worldwide market tensions, Germany agreed to reduce its high interest rates after Italy decided to devalue the ailing lira by 7 percent against other European currencies. [Page A1.] The fiercely independent German central bank gave in to pressure to lower rates because of the serious chaos in world currency markets and the threat that its hard-line position posed to European unity.

HEADLINE: German Concession;
The Bundesbank Bows to Pressure In Lowering Its High Interest Rates

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Germany's fiercely independent central bank is famous for staring down outsiders when they urge it to reduce its painfully high interest rates. But with today's announcement that it would cut rates, the Bundesbank blinked.
The pressures were too great. World currency markets were in chaos as the dollar slid to record lows against the German mark, and several European currencies withered in the face of the mark's strength. At the same time, economic growth was evaporating in Germany and Europe in general because of the Bundesbank's stratospheric rates -- which were intended to help reduce Germany's inflation but at the same time undermined growth by discouraging companies from borrowing and investing. 
 What is more, the French -- and some German officials -- complained that the Bundesbank's bullheadedness was sabotaging the road to European unity, and would push the French to reject a treaty calling for a single European currency when they vote on the matter next Sunday.
 
'It Was Right to Act'
 "The Bundesbank acted under enormous pressure, and it was right to act," said Stanley Fischer, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who used to be the World Bank's chief economist. "They were anxious not to be seen as bowing to pressure, but they did."
Finance Minister Michel Sapin of France said the Bundesbank decision showed the willingness of German authorities to take into account the economic situation beyond their borders.
 "Eight days before a vote which will be decisive for the building of Europe," Mr. Sapin said, "I am convinced that a 'yes' to the referendum will allow France to take advantage of the positive opportunities offered for its economy to take full advantage of the lowering of interest rates in Europe."
 
Higher Dollar Is Seen
 Although the German central bank did not say by how much it would lower rates, any cut at all will almost certainly cause the dollar to jump from its record lows. The main reason for the dollar's slide over the last month is that many investors have moved their money into Germany because short-term interest rates are so much higher there than those in the United States.
"This should mean an upward move for the dollar," said Robert A. White, director of foreign exchange operations for First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. He said the dollar, which was at 1.40 German marks early last week, could jump about 10 percent, to around 1.55 marks.
The dollar's recent fall has unnerved America's stock and bond markets as investors feared the dollar's slide would turn into an out-and-out plunge. Today's Bundesbank announcement should go far to reassure financial markets.
"I think the Bundesbank's move will be positive for the U.S. bond market because one of the things undercutting the rally is the fear created by the weak dollar," said Robert Giordano, chief economist for Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The stock markets should also respond favorably."
 
Weak European Economies
 The Bundesbank's high rates -- its most important short-term rate is 9.75 percent -- helped slow Germany's growth to near zero in the second quarter. Because other European Community countries have linked their rates to those of the powerful Bundesbank, Germany's rates have helped keep Britain in a prolonged recession and have also taken the momentum out of France's and Italy's weak economic recoveries.
"Europe's economy is weak right now, and if the Bundesbank had held on with its high rates, we would have had a real serious slowdown in Europe next year," said Professor Fischer of M.I.T. "Now, the chance of a European recovery is better than yesterday."
That bodes well for the American economy. Although Germany's high interest rates helped produce a weaker dollar that normally should spur American exports, those high rates simultaneously hobbled Europe's economic growth. A stalled European economy undermines American exports because European consumers will be able to afford fewer Levi jeans and European businesses will be buying fewer I.B.M. mainframes.
 
Fed May Have More Leeway
 By strengthening the dollar, the Bundesbank's announcement could give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut interest rates. Many economists say the Fed cut its Federal funds rate by only one-quarter of 1 percent, instead of one-half of 1 percent, on Sept. 4 because it was worried about the weak dollar. The Federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks lend each other money overnight.
Bush Administration officials have long badgered the Bundesbank to cut its rates, complaining that they were slowing growth in Germany and beyond. Just hours after the Bundesbank announcement, American officials were already taking some credit for the Bundesbank move. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the German action helped "fulfill President Bush's longstanding efforts to insure the strengthening of world growth."
For weeks, many Administration officials had fretted privately about the dollar's slide. If it had turned into a nose dive, that could have caused the stock market to plunge -- one of the last things any President wants a few weeks before the nation votes on whether to re-elect him.
 
Implications for Unity Vote
 The Bundesbank's move could also prove a boon to President Francois Mitterrand, France's No. 1 supporter of European unity and the Maastricht treaty. The Bundesbank's directors, by showing that even Germany's central bank will make some concessions to help other Europeans, might make French voters feel a little more kindly about unity.
If the Bundesbank had not acted and the French were to vote next Sunday against the Maastricht treaty calling for European unity, many people would have blamed the German central bank and its high interest rates for souring the French on unity and scuttling the treaty.
Many analysts had speculated that one reason the Bundesbank was keeping rates so high was to achieve that end -- to sabotage a treaty that would move control over Europe's monetary policy from the German central bank to a new European Community central bank where other countries had a voice.
But, some analysts say, the Bundesbank decided to cut rates a week before the French vote because its members feared that if the French defeated the treaty a crisis might follow in Europe's foreign exchange markets, maiming the European Monetary System.
While Bundesbank members have little eagerness for a Europe-wide central bank, they are keen believers in the monetary system, which has prevented wild exchange rate fluctuation and created an anchor for Europe's economic growth.
"The Bundesbank has bowed to pressures from other European nations about the need to stimulate growth and put a more positive slant on the Maastricht vote in France," said Mr. White, the foreign exchange manager. "But in the eyes of the market, the Bundesbank will have lost some credibility on fighting inflation."
Many economists had predicted that the Bundesbank would not lower rates for several months. Indeed, officials at the central bank had repeatedly said this year that they would not lower rates until inflation was brought under 3 percent and monetary growth stopped exceeding their targets. With inflation close to 3.5 percent, today's announcement showed the Bundesbank was giving in to external pressure before meeting its internal goals.
"It's a classic case of the Bundesbank coming to grips with outside realities," said William R. Cline, an economist with the Institute for International Economics in Washington.

HEADLINE: Official of I.M.F. Urges More Loans for Russia

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
A senior International Monetary Fund official says Russia will need about the same amount of foreign aid next year -- $18 billion -- that it is scheduled to receive this year to assist its traumatic transition to a market economy.
In a news briefing on Friday that was embargoed for release until Monday, the official, who insisted on anonymity, said he hoped the fund would negotiate a new aid package with Russia before January under which Russia would qualify for $3 billion more in I.M.F. loans. 
 The official said that while Russia had used most of this year's foreign aid to buy emergency items like food and medicine, he hoped the aid next year would go to buy machinery and other equipment to help rebuild the economy.
 
Advice for the Fed
 In his meeting with journalists, the I.M.F. official made numerous other points: he urged the Federal Reserve not to lower rates further to keep the dollar from falling, and he called on the American and German Governments to make sharp cuts in their budget deficits.
The briefing came a week before the monetary fund and World Bank hold their semiannual meeting in Washington. The Group of Seven industrial nations is also scheduled to hold a finance ministers' meeting next weekend. Aid to Russia and the dollar's weakness will certainly be discussed at the meetings.
The official said he hoped the I.M.F. would begin negotiating an agreement with Russia in October. Under Russia's current pact with the fund, which was made final last month, Moscow is receiving $1 billion in I.M.F. loans. That is part of a $24 billion Western aid package, which includes a $6 billion fund, not yet in effect, to stabilize the ruble.
 
Pledge on Inflation
 The official said the new aid package would be more comprehensive and stricter than the existing accord. Russia has promised to reduce inflation to less than 10 percent a month under the current agreement, but the official said he hoped it would pledge to cut inflation to less than 10 percent a year in the new pact.
That is a tall order because Russia's money supply continues to swell as workers demand higher wages to keep up with inflation, and state enterprises clamor for loans to stay afloat and repay debts to other enterprises.
"The money supply is certainly the domain where the problems are biggest," the official said, expressing optimism that Moscow's central bank would act prudently.
He said the new agreement should call on Russia to accelerate its privatizations, asserting that state enterprises that can be converted to viable private companies should be saved while those with dim prospects should be placed into bankruptcy.
Speaking before Germany's central bank announced today that it would cut its interest rates, the monetary fund official said the Federal Reserve should not cut interest rates further because that could weaken the fragile dollar even more and roil the world's currency markets.
Talking cautiously but with unusual directness, the official said: "We recommend prudence. We don't see what good a further decrease in rates can do, but we can see what risks it could entail for foreign currency markets."
The comments were the second instance in recent days in which the I.M.F. had criticized American policy. On Thursday, the organization said the United States Government should trim spending and increase taxes to cut its budget deficit, which it said was undermining long-term world economic growth.
Since December, the Federal Reserve has cut rates sharply to buoy the economy, making its most recent cut on Sept. 4, but the United States remains in an economic slump.
Fed officials said they had no response to the official's comments.
The official urged the United States to commit itself to cut the Federal budget deficit over the next few years by between $240 billion and $300 billion. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit will be $314 billion this year, or slightly more than 5 percent of the gross domestic product.

HEADLINE: U.S.-China Tensions Over Trade

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The war of words between China and the United States appears likely to intensify this week as the two sides meet here for trade talks that have taken on heavy political significance after President Bush's recent decision to sell jet fighters to Taiwan.
For the last several years, the United States has insisted that China do more to open its markets to American exports and provide greater protection for foreign patents and copyrights. Several agreements have been hammered out, generally with little fanfare. 
 But the latest talks, in which Washington is demanding that China lower a number of import barriers, have degenerated into a bitter exchange of threats that escalated sharply after President Bush said the United States would sell 150 F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan, which China regards as a runaway province. China has also complained that the sale violates a 1982 agreement under which the United States promised to reduce its weapons sales to Taiwan.
Sharpening the dispute is the fact that there are several other highly sensitive matters under discussion, leading to testy exchanges that mix economics and politics.
 
Senate to Vote on China
 In Washington, the Senate is expected to vote this week on a bill that would require China to improve its human rights record, limit its arms sales and open its markets before the nation is granted a renewal of its preferential access to the American market, known as most-favored-nation status. China bitterly resents the inclusion of these conditions.
The United States has been concerned about the recent detention of Shen Tong, a former student leader involved in the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square three years ago, who has returned to China to try to establish a human rights movement.
And American officials expressed deep concern late last week after China offered to sell nuclear technology to Iran. Although China and Iran both insisted that the technology would be used solely for peaceful purposes, the United States called the deal "imprudent." The Chinese responded by describing the American comments as "arrogant."
"There are so many things going on right now that are very real issues in the relationship that I'm not sure you can separate them out from the trade negotiations," said John Kamm, a longtime expert on trade with China who is now campaigning to ease China's human rights policies. "It will be very tricky to keep these things apart."
 
Threats and Responses
 The trade issue began to grow tense on Aug. 21 when the United States announced that it was prepared to raise tariffs on a range of Chinese-made goods if Beijing did not accede to American market-opening demands. The tariffs would cover $3.9 billion of American imports, like Chinese-made footwear, toys, electronic goods and electrical appliances.
The United States has been demanding that China lower tariffs, ease its import licensing rules, end import quotas and clarify trade laws.
Last week Chinese officials responded by saying they would increase tariffs to punitive levels on $4 billion of American-made goods that China imports -- including chemicals, automobiles, computers, medical equipment and commercial jets -- if Washington carried out its threat. An agricultural official said that China ought to cut off its imports of American wheat; China has been the largest purchaser of American wheat for the last several years.
The stakes were raised even further when Ira Wolf, an assistant United States trade representative, said that if China did not take the market-opening steps, Washington would bar its entry to the body that regulates world trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT.
Since China began expanding its foreign trade -- it is expected to buy and sell more than $165 billion worth of goods this year to other countries -- it has sought to become a member of GATT and integrate its economy more with the world trading system.
"If they fail to settle this case, then they are not getting into the GATT, period," Mr. Wolf said. "If they are not willing to make these concessions, there is no way in the world that the United States can allow China into the GATT. And there's no way in the world China can get into the GATT unless the United States goes along with it."
"We are prepared, if we don't settle this by Oct. 10, to retaliate," Mr. Wolf said. "And that's in no one's interest. But we are prepared to do so."

HEADLINE: Senate Race: The Clash of the Cathode Rays;
A Bewildering Barrage for Viewers as the New York Democrats Stump on Screen

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
It was possible to walk mile after mile over the weekend and find not a clue that political war was being waged with wild abandon across New York State. Out on Manhattan streets, conversations wandered over everything from the weather, to the economy, to the proper care and feeding of tarantulas ("Two dozen crickets every six weeks or so and they'll grow as big as your hand").
There was nary a whisper about the poison-filled finale to the Senate primary campaign that ends tomorrow. In Manhattan, along a five-mile stretch of Broadway from Harlem to midtown, the only immediate proof of Campaign Fever was a most unaggressive woman standing at the corner of 80th Street holding aloft a hand-lettered sign inviting New Yorkers to: "Have breakfast with Hillary and Tipper on Oct. 1."
Wrong race. 
 One block south, a leaflet drifted underfoot, its tattered remains the only clue to the storm and stress of the Democratic primary race for Senate. "Geraldine Ferraro is no liberal," the flier produced by a rival, Elizabeth Holtzman, cautioned. Then it promised not just a woman but "a progressive woman" to glide across the polished Senate floors.
 
Running on the Screen
 On Saturday afternoon, pedestrians just let it grind beneath their marching feet. The silence left some voters wondering where all those millions in campaign spending went.
To find out, all they had to do was sit at home. Modern politics is couch politics. Smokey back rooms long ago gave way to the whistle stop, the radio exhortation, the stump speech and the pump after pump of numbing handshakes. Now, if the streets are any measure, the 1992 Senate primary shows that the bitterest fights have moved back indoors.
That makes the remote-control clicker the king to the advertisements' queen. Sometimes they are complementary. Sometimes not.
"I treated them like any other commercial," Lilly Singer, a 69-year-old White Plains social worker, said of the combative political advertisements aired in the final push before tomorrow's voting. "I basically ignored them."
For the politicians themselves, the last days of the campaign, and the avalanche of advertising they unleash, is a multimillion-dollar gamble to win voters' attention and send them to the polls renewed, full of a sense that their candidate and no other is the one who should book the next seat to Washington. Of course, things do not always work out that way.
Across New York State over the weekend, many Democratic voters said they had tuned in to the advertisements and the television news coverage of the final days of the race, but have not been turned on.
"What I do on Tuesday may be affected by the negative ads," said Daniel A. Goulding, a high school teacher from suburban Buffalo. "And I find that disturbing."
Also troubled was Eleanor Golden, a registered Democrat from the East Village in Manhattan. "You turn on the TV and see Holtzman attacking Ferraro one minute, Ferraro attacking Holtzman the next. It's like a made-for-TV movie. You see candidates on TV all dolled up. They don't tell us how to solve the drug problem, the homeless problem, affordable housing and the AIDS crisis."
At 7 P.M. Saturday, it was possible to sit through the local news and hear about the Senate contest only in a cascade of advertisements at the end. The news programs themselves focused on the hurricane in Hawaii, the Presidential race, the weekend's festivals and a hate crime. On several stations, the ads provided the only clue to tomorrow's election. Played back to back, they sometimes blurred. First Ms. Holtzman ran an ad featuring Ms. Ferraro's face in freeze-frame and a list of moral indictments. Then Ms. Ferraro's team retorted with a spot denying all the nasty things said about her.
For the idle viewer, the result could be disorienting: Was that Ms. Ferraro first setting up the negative charges and then batting them away? Or was that a Holtzman ad that led into one by her lighter-haired adversary? The latter was the case. But without giving the glimmering screen one's full attention, it was a little hard to tell.
So many ads. So little time.
 
The Ads Pile Up
 Later Saturday night, the news teams invited the politicians on board. In clips from the day's campaigning on Fox News about 10:15 P.M., Ms. Ferraro called Ms. Holtzman a kamikaze pilot. Attorney General Robert Abrams spoke of the need for better health care. Ms. Holtzman held forth on ethics. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who cannot afford television spots but has won cautious admiration from some for sticking with the issues, appeared too.
There was a lot of slamming back and forth followed by the commentator's question about whether the four could possibly work together after tomorrow night. It was a good question, though rhetorical, and popped up again the next morning in a televised debate.
As the night wore on with reports of the shuttle liftoff, updates on the damage in Hawaii, a spot on malfunctioning seatbelts and an appearance (on WWOR) of Gizmo the weather dog, the political quotient kept rising. The political ads bunched up as well, falling mostly into the breaks at every half hour. By 11:20, WCBS broadcast longer pieces on the race, showing Ms. Ferraro denying that her husband had ever met a reputed mob figure, Mr. Abrams accusing Ms. Ferraro of sending hecklers to disrupt his news conference and other candidates complaining about the bitterness and the sleaze.
 
Litany of Charges
 Then, a moment out for -- the ads. First, Mr. Abrams hit Ms. Ferraro. Then Ms. Holtzman hit Ms. Ferraro. Then Ms. Ferraro announced, "I want to set the record straight." At times, it helped to pause to remind oneself whether it was the attacks accurately reported by the news teams or the attacks videotaped by the advertising teams that were drifting out from the TV screen.
The result, for many viewers, was input without clarification.
Faced with weeks of charges and countercharges and a level of bitterness and bile that she said filled her with "distaste," Mary Ann Winters, a 44-year-old Yonkers resident and a senior executive with a Manhattan marketing firm, described herself as "in a quandary." She said she no longer could tell what was "hyped" and what was real. Nor did she know, just 48 hours before the primary, whom she would vote for. She said she had a slight preference for Ms. Ferraro over the other candidates but then acknowledged, "I've never been this blase."
 
Ferraro Here, Ferraro There
 Yesterday morning's news deluge offered some hope. Yet the advertisements were the same ones that had run the night before and the WNBC debate mostly retraced familiar charges and familiar ground. Only when the moderator, Gabe Pressman, led the conversation into specific questions about what each of the four candidates would do with money generated by a cut in military spending did any new focus or information emerge. Most of the rest of the hour was spent on familiar spats that were repeated in quick succession in the too-familiar advertisements that ran, back to back, at the debate's close.
Still, television sometimes does offer moments that street politics could never match.
Yesterday's twist came in a new and unsettling experience of the perhaps diminishing distance between reality and perception. For several mind-twisting moments, Ms. Ferraro seemed to appear live on WCBS and live on WNBC's political debate. For her Channel 2 appearance, which was actually pre-recorded, the candidate wore beige. On Channel 4, she wore salmon.

HEADLINE: Istanbul Journal;
The Sephardim Give Thanks for 500 Good Years

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, Sept. 8

 BODY:
For years it was the wisdom among Istanbul's Sephardic Jews that their status as a small minority in a largely Muslim land dictated low profiles and unobtrusive living.
This year, as the Jews here observe the 500th anniversary of their forebears' expulsion from Spain in 1492, the reticence is gone. 
 With visits by American and other Jewish groups, exhibits abroad, a journey here by the President Chaim Herzog of Israel, even the issue of a commemorative postage stamp, the 26,000-member community has embarked on a celebration not only of its own history and identity but also of what many say is the tolerance and harmony inspired across centuries by Muslim Turkish leaders.
To mark the occasion, Istanbul's Jews are restoring one of the city's oldest active synagogues, the 15th-century Ahrida synagogue, which predates the Ottoman capture of the city from the Byzantines in 1453.
 
Synagogue Attack a Factor
 The new self-confidence reflects Turkey's own emergence into a bustling free-market economy in which Jews are less fearful of seeming to be a wealthy elite.
But some Jews also say that the higher profile paradoxically dates from the terrorist attack at the Neve Shalom synagogue in 1986, in which 22 Jewish worshipers were killed. The assault thrust Turkish Jews to the center of international attention.
"A very positive effect was to make us known as a Jewish community," said Nedim Yahya, a leading organizer of the 500th-anniversary celebration. That, maybe, was not what everybody wanted.
This year's celebration, said Avi Alkas, a Jewish businessman, "was a radical move within the community because normally in the past our older generation was not that eager for publicity." By contrast, he said, the exposure to American and European Jews this year has left Istanbul's Jews "feeling more a part of international world Jewry, a feeling of belonging to a bigger family."
Leyla Alaton, the public relations director of a large industrial holding company run by her father, Ishak Alaton, said, "This became like a thank-you message, just to show how thankful we are living so well in Turkey." She added that the frequent visits here by American Jewish organizations had won important new friends in Washington for Turkey, a longstanding Western ally.
Beyond the widely publicized celebrations, though, some Turkish Jews detect changes that in recent years have transformed -- and possibly weakened -- their community.
As Istanbul has spread from its old core athwart the Golden Horn, so have its Jewish residents abandoned areas where they once formed close-knit communities. Now they are dispersed in the sprawl of a city whose residents number some 10 million, or one-sixth of Turkey's fast-growing population.
Since the beginning of this century, the Jewish population in Turkey has fallen from around 120,000 and, some say, it is still slowly declining because the number of deaths is marginally higher than the number of births. Before Israel's creation, the community numbered around 80,000, but many went as immigrants to the new nation. Synagogue attendance is said to dwindling, too.
 
Few Now Speak Ladino
 Moreover, few young Jews these days speak the Judeo-Spanish language called Ladino, which was once dominant among Istanbul's Sephardim. Such is the absence of religious fervor that the city's only yeshiva closed years ago. "There was no single student at that school, not a single one," Mr. Yahya said. "Now, to teach rabbis, we have to send them to Israel or the United States."
Of the decline in the use of Ladino, Mr. Yahya said: "We have never had a schooling in Judeo-Spanish. It was a language that was orally transmitted." The Jewish schools in Istanbul, he said, use Turkish as their language of instruction, "with a couple of hours a week of Hebrew."
"I can still manage with Ladino," said Mr. Alkas, who is 35 years old and part of the younger generation of Istanbul Jews, "but unfortunately not my two sons. I am one of the few of my age that speaks Ladino."
In addition, he said, he had given his sons non-Jewish names -- Emir and Alp -- "to reduce the feeling of being separate and different" that he had experienced while serving Turkey's compulsory military conscription.
The acknowledgment of such sentiment was one of very few in conversations with Jews here, most of whom emphasized the absence of discrimination and anti-Semitism in Turkey.
 
A Comparison Rejected
 Mr. Yahya, for instance, took issue with comparisons between Turkish Jews and oppressed Jews in Arab countries, recalling that non-Arab Turkey had been one of the first countries to recognize Israel in 1948 and emphasizing the Western-oriented secularism of Kemal Ataturk, who founded the modern Turkish republic in 1923. "There has never been anti-Semitism in Turkey," he said. "But, as everywhere, there have been anti-Semites."
That label has been attached most frequently over the last few months to Adnan Hoca, leader of a secretive Muslim sect whose newspaper, Son Mesaji, or The Last Message, routinely tilts at what it depicts as an international Zionist conspiracy headed by Freemasons and Jews.
"But you can't take it seriously," Mr. Yahya said of the newspaper. "In one issue it said the Masons' subcommittees in the conspiracy were three: Rotary Club, Lion's Club -- and Diners Club."

HEADLINE: Rebuilding of South Florida Aids Mobile-Home Orders

BYLINE: By JONATHAN HICKS

 BODY:
As residents of southern Florida look to replace, quickly and relatively inexpensively, homes destroyed by Hurricane Andrew, a boom appears to be beginning in the mobile-home industry.
Makers of mobile homes -- including larger ones that are not truly mobile, since they are fabricated in two or three pieces and assembled on the site -- say their plants are running at capacity. They are working to fill orders not only from mobile-home parks that have been devastated by the disaster, but also from distributors that want to keep their supply intact in anticipation of shortages.
 
One Maker's Orders Rise 75%
 At Fleetwood Enterprises, the nation's largest maker of mobile homes, orders in the last few weeks have risen nearly 75 percent, compared with the period in 1991. 
 "We have found that demand has increased because of people who actually want homes and from distributors who don't want to be caught out there without supplies," said Jon A. Nord, senior vice president of the housing group of Fleetwood, which is based in Riverside, Calif.
That demand for mobile homes, also called manufactured homes, has already started affecting prices, industry officials say.
"We have already seen one memo," from a maker, "saying that a small increase, about $250 per unit, will go into effect," said Daniel L. Vaughn, a sales consultant at the Hamptons Golf and Country Club, a retirement community of manufactured homes in Lakeland, Fla., about 40 miles west of Orlando.
Mr. Vaughn added that his company and other buyers of manufactured homes anticipated that the price would increase at least $500 to $600 a unit because of the tightening supply of many materials that go into the homes. Manufactured homes generally sell for $18,000 to $80,000.
And the makers of manufactured homes say they have already seen tighter supplies of several items, including plywood, roofing materials and certain lumber products.
 
 
New Concerns About Safety
 The large number of mobile homes in Florida and their vulnerability to natural disasters has many public officials worried about the safety issue, and those concerns could have a profound effect on the industry.
The Dade County Board of Rules and Appeals recently adopted a recommendation that sets the same standards for mobile homes as those for traditionally built homes. That recommendation calls for manufactured homes to withstand winds of up to 120 miles an hour.
"I have great concerns about the safety of mobile homes," said Bertram S. Warshaw, chairman of the board, which oversees building codes in Dade County. "They are not structurally capable of withstanding high winds."
Mr. Warshaw added, "We simply want mobile homes to be required to meet the same performance standards as permanent residences."
Jack Kemp, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has ordered a full-scale review of the Government's manufactured housing code to insure that it provides adequate protection to residents of mobile homes in hurricanes.
Bruce A. Savage, a spokesman for the Manufactured Housing Institute, an industry trade group in Arlington, Va., said that builders were "committed to building and properly installing homes that are safe, durable and affordable for homeowners."
He added that builders of mobile homes conformed to standards mandated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "So if there is a question about manufactured homes, it's not whether they are built to the code, but whether the code is adequate," he said. "We'll build to whatever code they establish."
 
 
Sites Need to Be Cleared
 The convoys of trucks carrying mobile homes to communities in Florida like Homestead have not yet formed. There is still a need to demolish and remove the rubble left by the storm. Moreover, there are more immediate needs in the affected communities, like restoring electricity, sanitation service and water.
Nonetheless, manufacturers of the homes are stepping up production, and retailers and operators of mobile-home parks are increasing their purchases, because mobile homes offer a quick and relatively inexpensive method of providing housing for the tens of thousands of people whose homes were destroyed.
"Before the hurricane, we saw the demand for mobile homes as being sluggish," said Rollin E. Priest, chief executive of Ronlee Mobile Home Centers Inc., an Orlando-based retailer of mobile homes and operator of mobile-home parks. "But now the tempo has picked up."
Mr. Priest added that it would probably be one and a half to two years before damaged homes could be rebuilt in the areas affected by the hurricane, while mobile homes could be set up in weeks.
"You have 50,000 housing units that have to be replaced, and that's not going to happen overnight," he said.
 The Florida Manufactured Housing Association, a state trade association, estimated in a survey that 85,000 traditionally constructed houses and about 10,000 manufactured homes had been destroyed or damaged by the hurricane. Already the Federal Government has requested about 1,000 manufactured homes from storage areas in the South to be sent to areas in Florida affected by the hurricane. And manufacturers like Redman Homes Inc., the Skyline Corporation and Clayton Homes Inc. have begun to gear up for the demand.
The mobile home industry has already had a fairly robust year. The Manufactured Housing Institute said that in the first seven months of the year, production of mobile homes rose to 114,184 units, a jump of 17 percent from the 97,519 produced in the comparable period last year.
Officials of the trade group contend that the recession has made manufactured homes more attractive to home buyers because they generally cost 30 to 50 percent less than homes built by traditional methods.
 
 
Popular in Florida
 Manufactured homes are an important segment of the housing stock in Florida. They accounted for more than 750,000 of the state's 6.1 million housing units, according to the 1990 census, about 12 percent of all homes in Florida. That compares with a national average of about 7 percent.
Mobile home producers typically fill orders with production from plants closest to where the units are needed. "We have already had substantial backlogs in our plant in Florida," said Bill J. Thoma, manager of marketing with Redman Homes, the Dallas company that is the nation's second-largest producer of mobile homes. "Our question is how we can meet some of the extra need that the public will have in an efficient manner."

HEADLINE: Free Trade Batters Mexico's Stocks

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 13

 BODY:
After months in which investors in Mexican equities waited hopefully for a North American Free Trade Agreement, the announcement of an accord has brought only tougher times to the beleaguered Mexico City stock market.
With Mexican domestic interest rates rising and expectations for the economy's growth falling, the exchange fell 7.1 percent, or nearly 100 points, last week to its lowest level since September of last year. It was the second-worst week of the year for the market -- the Bolsa de Valores -- and the fifth straight to register a decline. Since June, values on the Bolsa have fallen 32 percent. 
 Stock analysts in Mexico City and New York tied the problems in part to the trade pact that Mexico, Canada and the United States announced on Aug. 12.
 
Government Criticized
 Increasingly, analysts criticize the Mexican Government for having oversold the agreement by suggesting it would bring a relatively quick economic impact and by playing down the difficulties involved in its ratification in the United States and Canada.
As those difficulties grew more obvious last week, interest rates on long-term Mexican Treasury certificates jumped above 19 percent, their highest level of the year.
But beyond luring foreign investors into the money market, the rise in interest rates also added to the investors' broader concerns about the Mexican economy's prospects for growth, several analysts said.
"The market has really lost its compass in the short term," said Alexander C. Anderson, director of research for the Mexico City brokerage ABACO Casa de Bolsa S.A. "And many people are talking now about sluggish growth next year as well."
The Bolsa began to slip on Tuesday, as United States trade officials made their first effort to defend the trade agreement before angry legislators in Congress. But then things got worse.
At the weekly Mexican Treasury auction the next day, interest rates on 91-day Government certificates jumped to 19 percent. In Washington, the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, leveled the Democrats' most serious attack on the trade agreement yet, saying that it would badly hurt American workers and the environment and that it should be renegotiated. The market here fell 43.89 points, or 3.2 percent.
With equity investors continuing to sell on Thursday in response to the Treasury auction, United States Labor Secretary Lynn Martin's acknowledgment that the trade pact could cost as many as 150,000 American jobs helped send the Bolsa down again, stock analysts said. Values on the market fell 3.03 percent more.
The market scratched back up 8.32 points, or 0.65 percent, on Friday to close at 1,294.09. But for the week it fell 98.55 points.
 
Silver Lining Tarnished
 In contrast to their initial response to the even sharper drop in Mexican equity values in June, brokers proffered relatively little optimistic commentary about a silver lining of good long-term values.
As of this week, average prices were down to about 10.5 times last year's earnings; some companies' stock values were below 8 times their projected 1992 earnings, brokers said. Earlier in the year, the valuations for some Mexican stocks reached as high as 18 times their projected 1992 earnings.
"In the long term, it does look very good," Mr. Anderson said. But like others, he suggested some difficulty in seeing that far into the future.
The authorities reported last week that the consumer price index rose only six-tenths of 1 percent in August, bringing inflation to 7.7 percent for the year. That was the lowest eight-month rise in prices since 1972.
But even from a rate of 18.8 percent last year, inflation is not dropping as quickly as many economic officials and investors would like. And while several economists and analysts said they doubted that the Government would reach its goal of keeping inflation in single digits this year, some predicted that its efforts would push economic growth well below 3 percent both this year and next.
Late last year the Government predicted that the economy would grow 4 percent in 1992; in June it offered an estimate of 3 to 3.5 percent.
After the announcement of a six-month budget surplus that surpassed even the Finance Ministry's year-end goals, the rising interest rates suggest that the Government will continue to slow down the economy in response to its growing current-account deficit, a decline in capital inflows and the effects on Mexico of the recession in the United States, economists said.
Although the policy has raised fears of an eventual devaluation, economists and stock analysts saw as unlikely anything more than a widening of the range within which the exchange rate could fluctuate.
"There is very little money leaving Mexico," said Jacques Levy, executive vice president of the brokerage Banamex/Accival. "It is just shifting from one place to another."
Referring to the benchmark London interbank offered rate, he added, "There are very few investors who can resist interest rates of something like Libor times three."

HEADLINE: BAY SHORE JOURNAL;
It Rained Pennies For Stores

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: BAY SHORE, N.J.

 BODY:
Normally in these days after the big Labor Day weekend, the back room of Melissa Serafin's gift shop here would still be half-full of seashells, mermaid thermometers and other flotsam of the seaside commercial season. But to hear her tell it, the tourists who braved this summer's rainy days and blustery weekends spent the day combing the shops instead of the sodden beach.
"We had one of the best years ever," she said. "I'm empty." 
 While tourist-beckoning resorts like this one counted more motel cancellations and shorter visits than in even last year's recession-battered season, many merchants like Ms. Serafin seemed to be glad for the weather. Too much sun, they said, only brings business to the life-guards, and a downpour ruins everyone's day. But a nice overcast sky, perhaps a bearable mist, even a drizzle, will send the tourists looking for someplace to go besides the beach.
"Our visitors were really in good spirits," said Ms. Serafin, who manages Nautilus Gifts in the Bay Village shopping arcade. "Obviously they were disappointed with the weather. But they were like, we're here, we're committed, we might as well have a good time."
This far down Long Beach Island, beyond the widening ring of commuter suburbs between New York City and Philadelphia, shopkeepers stay open only during the warm months, and they depend on the summer shore season the way farmers depend on a single planting. Three-quarters of most shopkeepers' annual income comes from the months between Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends. For some, those days provide the only income of the year.
That is why Lew and Anna Richards approached their first season as the owners of the Crust and Crumb Bakery with such apprehension. The Richardses bought a bakery last spring. They found themselves in debt and working 16-hour days.
But as soon as their doughnuts and crullers and elephant ears (a New Jersey cookie staple) were laid out under the glass counter, the Crust and Crumb was jammed with customers, Mrs. Richards said.
"We never expected to do so well our first year," she added while taking a break from the flour and the sugar and the butter and the eggs. "People came down, and I guess they just shopped themselves out. Now we've recovered some financially, we'll stay open through the Chowder Festival and then sit back for the winter and consider ourselves lucky."
The worst effects of the poor weather appeared to be on the motels, which reported far more cancellations than normal, said Jeanne DiPaola, executive director of the Southern Ocean County Chamber of Commerce. She said many merchants had hoped the summer of '92 would start a recovery from a slide in business since the mid-1980's.
Ms. DiPaola also reported the resumption of a trend toward shorter stays that had leveled off recently.
"It's the contracting summer vacation," she said. "It has been going on, but it had stabilized lately in a three-or four-night stay, but this year we saw far more requests for one or two nights only."
She did not blame the weather. "Those I spoke to said it was a 'can't afford' kind of thing," she said.
But the backbone of Long Beach Island's summer business is the vacationers who own or rent for a week or more thousands of cottages. Committed by ownership or lease to vacationing by the sea, it was the cottage residents who made the season a good one, Mrs. Richards said.
If there was a complaint from shopkeepers, it was that the visitors opted for less-expensive purchases, said Kelly Coleman, manager of Breezin' Up, a mid-priced beach-wear outlet. Her business was "about the same" as last year, she said, for items that typically started at $15.
At Ms. Sarafina's nearly-sold-out gift shop, most items cost about $3.
"It seemed like people were really conserving their money," Ms. Coleman said. "If you have to buy something, it's easier to buy something to eat than a $15 T-shirt. They'd tell their kids, "No you can't have the shirt, but we'll get some cotton candy.' Kind of a bribe."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Issues: The Environment;
In Timber Country, Bush Will Join Logging War

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Four years ago, George Bush used a campaign swing through the Pacific Northwest to compare himself to Theodore Roosevelt and to highlight his promise to be "the environmental President." On Monday, as the President's schedule calls for him to visit logging communities in Oregon and Washington, Mr. Bush is expected to forget about tree-hugging and embrace the ax instead.
Bypassing the major cities, Mr. Bush will speak to timber workers in depressed rural areas where there has been a virtual civil war over the forests. Aides and supporters say he will speak out against "environmental extremists" and play up his plan to save timber jobs. 
 In advance of the visit, the President has already delivered a gift to the loggers: on Thursday, he ordered Federal agencies to speed up logging of dead timber, bypassing the usual restrictions and appeals from citizens.
But while the attempt to woo voters who are wary of environmental excess could play well in some places, Mr. Bush is in such deep trouble on the West Coast that there may be very little he can do to win here, political analysts from both parties say.
 
Toppling Timberland Myths
 Polls in Washington, Oregon and California -- together, the three states have 25 percent of the electoral votes needed to win -- show the President trailing Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas by 13 to 22 points. Washington and Oregon were the only states in the West to vote against Mr. Bush in 1988, and California went Republican by the narrowest of margins.
Even timber workers, who would seem to be at odds with Mr. Clinton for the environmental leanings of his running mate, Senator Al Gore, instead are angry at Mr. Bush. In his book, "Earth in the Balance," Mr. Gore lamented the cutting of ancient forests in the Northwest and called for protection of more land. The Administration has advocated amending the Endangered Species Act, which has been used to curtail logging to protect the spotted owl.
"George Bush has done absolutely nothing for our workers," said Bill Hubbell, president of the International Woodworkers of America, based in Oregon. "We've had reams of rhetoric from the Administration, but they have never tried to take the bull by the horns."
In a pre-emptive strike, Mr. Clinton last week won the support of the major unions representing 125,000 timber workers by promising to tackle the stalemate between loggers and environmentalists. "This crisis represents yet another example of a White House long on the politics of blame and short on leadership," Mr. Clinton said in a letter to the timber unions.
Mr. Clinton also is planning to be in Oregon on Monday, speaking in Portland and then visiting an out-of-work timber family in Springfield.
The major problem for the President, union leaders said, is that the timber crisis happened on his watch. In the last decade, thousands of timber workers lost their jobs because of the recession, foreign competition and automation. In the last four years, environmental restrictions on Federal forests have hastened the decline. While the Bush Administration has had Cabinet-level committees studying the issue, most logging on Federal lands in the Northwest has been halted because of lawsuits.
The judge who has been most responsible for shutting down logging to protect the spotted owl -- Judge William L. Dwyer of United States District Court in Seattle -- was an appointee of President Reagan. In a ruling last year that blocked Forest Service plans to resume its tree-cutting policy in the Northwest, Judge Dwyer wrote that the Administration had shown a "deliberate and systematic refusal" to follow Federal laws on fish and wildlife.
"Clinton's great advantage here is that all the disarray, inaction and confusion -- they've been like Larry, Moe and Curly -- has come from the Federal agencies run by George Bush," said Representative Les AuCoin, a Democrat trying to unseat Senator Bob Packwood, a Republican.
 
Owls vs. People
 But there may also be an opening for the President to play on fears that environmental restrictions will soon affect the cities as well as rural areas, his supporters say. The majority of votes are not in the dying timber towns, but in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. While the core of environmental support is in the cities, there has been some erosion because of the poor economy, particularly in California. Efforts to save endangered runs of Pacific salmon, for example, could lead to rate increases for water users in the major cities.
"Voters don't want to choose between the owl and people, but if they have to, they will choose people," said Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, the principal architect of Republican strategy in the West to paint Democrats as environmental extremists. On Mr. Gorton's advice, President Bush plans to visit a mill town outside Spokane and one in southern Oregon during his visit on Monday.
Craig Berkman, chairman of the Oregon Republican Party, said recent polling suggested that jobs outweigh the environment as a concern among West Coast voters.
"There is a changing dynamic at work: more and more people are looking at these environmental excesses and saying that something is wrong," said Mr. Berkman.
But voters, even in the heaviest timber counties of Oregon, have been sending a somewhat different message. In Jackson County, Oregon, which President Bush plans to visit on Monday, Harry Lonsdale, a maverick Democrat who rails against clear cutting and excessive logging, beat Senator Mark O. Hatfield, the longtime Republican incumbent, last year . This, despite Mr. Hatfield's endorsement from the timber unions.
Political analysts attribute the shift to newcomers, primarily from California, who view the timber industry as a despoiler of the scenery.
"We all know the forests are disappearing and we all know many loggers are going to lose their jobs," said Tim Hermach, head of the Native Forest Council, an Oregon environmental group. "What people really want is someone to respect them, someone who won't lie to them about the future."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
In a Heated Senate Campaign, More Questions Than Answers

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
NEW YORK may still be the only state where being branded a moderate is a political smear. That was merely one of the negatives hurled in this year's Democratic campaign for the United States Senate.
But didn't Bill Clinton's victory herald an ideological shift? 
 In the state's Presidential primary last April, Mr. Clinton handily defeated Edmund G. Brown Jr., who was generally viewed as more liberal. Still, Mr. Clinton got fewer votes than the combined total for Mr. Brown and for Paul E. Tsongas, who drew some liberal Democrats, too. And a number of liberals said their embrace of Mr. Clinton reflected less a philosphical shift than an equally seismic admission that if winning isn't everything, then ideological perfection isn't the only thing.
Voter surveys found that Mr. Clinton did best among Democrats who identified themselves as moderates, but that they were still outnumbered statewide by self-described liberals.
A victory tomorrow by Geraldine A. Ferraro in the Democratic primary for the Senate would not necessarily signal the decline of liberalism either. Her endorsement of the death penalty for the most egregious crimes is the major philosophical fault that separates the four candidates in a largely nonideological campaign. Also, she faces divided opposition from three rivals who consider themselves more liberal than she is. Chances are their combined vote will be higher than hers, no matter who wins.
But if liberals begrudgingly embraced Mr. Clinton as most electable, Ms. Ferraro, her rivals insist, is in just the opposite position: lingering questions about her family's financial affairs might neutralize ethics as a weapon against the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Some politicians suggest, though, that erasing one E-word from the Senate campaign might actually focus attention more clearly on the other: the economy. Unemployment may be the best weapon against an incumbent whose fellow Republicans have run the White House for 12 years.
This is supposed to be the Year of the Woman. Also, the Year of the Challenger. Which is why Mr. D'Amato describes himself as "makin' waves." None of his four potential opponents better exemplifies change than the Rev. Al Sharpton, the poor man's Ross Perot, except that credibility and consistency count, too.
Does character count?
Sure, but for how much? So far, Mr. Clinton has managed to survive bruising personal criticism and innuendo with remarkable resiliency. So had Ms. Ferraro. When she began her campaign, her comeback was widely discounted. Many politicians predicted that she would be unable to transform the celebrity of her historic 1984 campaign for Vice President into electoral support in 1990 after being pelted repeatedly with questions about her family's financial affairs. Tomorrow, New York voters will decide what becomes a legend most.
Did negative campaigning work?
Yes, but for whom? Ms. Ferraro acknowledged that negative advertising by two of her opponents, State Attorney General Robert Abrams and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, had found its target. As a result, last week she relented and made public tax returns that she had resisted releasing, after arguing, as Mr. Clinton has regarding his draft status, that each disclosure would only encourage demands for more.
Mr. Abrams, ahead of Ms. Holtzman in the polls, seemed more inclined to be her second in the verbal jousting with Ms. Ferraro. Ms. Holtzman's role better suited her volatile mix of brains and political brawn, but even in the Year of the Woman, will New Yorkers heed Mr. Sharpton's advice to vote for the one they want -- not who they think can win the primary?
Even Mayor David N. Dinkins complained that the campaign had got too negative. He is an Abrams supporter, but, having confronted similar questions himself, was sensitive to the political damage they could inflict and to the fairness they could violate.
Did Ms. Ferraro respond effectively?
The concealment of her early tax returns, as it turned out, seemed more incriminating than the returns themselves, which makes you wonder why, instead of crying foul, she didn't disclose them earlier.
Also, it is arguable whether even the relatively few Italian-Americans who vote in a Democratic primary will share her professions of shock that she, unlike her rivals, was being subjected to questions about whether any of her husband's business associates had any links to organized crime -- particularly when one of his prominent tenants did.
During last week's debate, she sparred more effectively as a prosecutor than as a politician. She all but shouted, "Gotcha!" when, in marshaling evidence against her, a slightly flustered Mr. Abrams forgot a date and Ms. Holtzman couldn't immediately recall whether anyone had been arrested when the authorities raided a warehouse that a Ferraro family company had leased to a pornographer with ties to organized crime.
Yesterday's debate left the Family of New York looking like the Bickersons. Three follow-up questions were left to the voters: Are the date or the arrest really material to the original charges? Are the charges relevant to the Senate race? Are Ms. Ferraro's responses more revealing than the charges themselves?

Post Owner Still Hopes to Buy Daily News

BYLINE: By Alex S. Jones

 BODY:
PETER S. KALIKOW, the owner of The New York Post, still considers himself a very serious prospective buyer for the bankrupt Daily News, even though he is in bankruptcy himself.
Mr. Kalikow, a New York real estate developer, said late last week that he fully expected the paper's unions and creditors to come to him eventually. "They know I'm ready to buy it," he said. 
 Last week, rumors flew that Mr. Kalikow was in new difficulty when it became known that the Bankers Trust Company, one of his principal bankers, was seeking a newspaper executive capable of managing a Post-News combination. The initial assumption was that Mr. Kalikow, who is publisher of The Post, would be removed.
But Mr. Kalikow said that this assumption was wrong and that Bankers Trust was seeking such an executive because he was close to refinancing his debts.
For months, Mr. Kalikow has been saying he has been working on an agreement in which Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan and an unidentified investor would acquire about half his real estate business and, at the same time, deliver him from bankruptcy.
He said part of the deal was that the banks would provide financing to buy The News.
Mr. Kalikow's latest comments follow the decision of Conrad M. Black, who controls The Daily Telegraph in London, to drop out of the negotiations to buy The News.
Late last week, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, a real estate developer and owner of U.S. News & World Report, won the support of most unions at The News in his effort to buy the paper.
Mr. Kalikow said Bankers Trust was looking a replacement for his former top lieutenant, Richard Nasti, who left The Post earlier this year after a scandal in which false circulation claims were made.
Neither Bankers Trust nor Chase Manhattan volunteered information on the situation.
Michael M. Connery, a lawyer advising the newspaper unions in the effort to find a buyer for The News, said Mr. Kalikow was not involved in the process in any serious way.
A reinvigorated News would be a formidable threat to The Post, and The Post's best chance for long-term survival is probably to buy The News.
Mr. Kalikow said he would also consider offers to sell The Post, but Mr. Zuckerman has thus far expressed no interest in buying it.
 
Labor's Outcast
 In a related matter, while 9 of The News's 10 unions have thus far stuck together in one-for-all solidarity in the sale of the paper, the 10th -- Local Six of the former International Typographical Union -- is very much an outcast.
"We are being excluded from the process," complained James Grottola, president of the union, which is now part of the Communications Workers of America, at a bankruptcy hearing on Friday.
Indeed, prospective buyers seem to have concluded that they can save most or all of the $9.5 million in annual wages that go to the 167-member printers' union to satisfy lifetime job guarantees negotiated in 1974.
And the other unions not only do not care, but some union leaders say on condition of anonymity that they think their former I.T.U. brothers will only be getting what they deserve.
Two years ago, the I.T.U. did not support the other unions in striking The News when it was owned by the Tribune Company. The I.T.U. was fearful that striking might jeopardize the lifetime job guarantees.
The bitterness of that break with the other unions has remained.
Mr. Grottola said that language in the 1974 agreement stipulates that successor buyers of The News must honor the job guarantees. But in an asset sale, in which parts of a company but not its stock are sold, a buyer can reject existing contracts, which is apparently what prospective buyers plan to do.
Mr. Grottola said no prospective buyers had sought to negotiate with the printers' union in any meaningful way. The union has filed a grievance procedure and sought arbitration.
 
Thawing Out Foreign Affairs
 With the end of the cold war, that forum of the cold war -- Foreign Affairs -- is rethinking its mission as its 70th anniversary approaches.
"We realize that a significant part of our 110,000 buyers skim, read a little here and there and leave it on the coffee table," said James F. Hoge Jr., who took over as editor of Foreign Affairs last month.
The magazine, which appears five times each year, is engaged in an ambitious circulation-building campaign, including mailed offers that arrive in envelopes demanding in bold black type, "Should you be reading 'the most influential periodical in print' ?"
What the promotion does not say is that the quote comes from a 1962 issue of Time magazine, at the pinnacle of the cold war. Time actually described Foreign Affairs as "one of the most influential periodicals in print," but it also said it was "the most prestigious journal of its kind in the world."
Certainly, Foreign Affairs, which is published by the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, has had some very important moments.
Perhaps its greatest coup came in 1947 when George F. Kennan, in an article signed by the pseudonym X, described what became the policy of containment of the Soviet Union. The article created a sensation, though Mr. Kennan, then a member of the State Department's policy planning staff, refused to confirm he was the author for years.
But with the end of the cold war, Foreign Affairs began to reconsider its approach.
Mr. Hoge said the new Foreign Affairs would become more focused on economics and environmental issues and have shorter articles. Even such aids to readers as subheadings and graphics are being considered, though Mr. Hoge said such radical changes would not be introduced right away.

HEADLINE: Peter G. Treves, 77, Financier, Broker And Writer on Italy

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Peter G. Treves, who fled his native Italy in the 1930's to escape Fascism and became a financier, economist, publisher and author in America, died on Friday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, where he was attending a business conference.
He was 77 years old and lived in Palm Beach, Fla. He died of a heart attack, his family said. 
 Mr. Treves was born in Turin, Italy, to a family prominent in financial and Jewish circles. He escaped Fascism at the onset of war, going to London as a post-graduate student and then to New York to work on Wall Street.
During World War II he worked for the Federal Board of Economic Warfare as a senior analyst, assessing Italy's economy as ill-equipped to fight a lengthy war. In the occupation, he went to Rome to advise authorities on reconstruction and relief.
Returning to New York, he worked for brokerage houses and then formed his own firm and bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.
Among his ventures, Mr. Treves was a leader in proxy battles for the control of Twentieth Century Fox and Curtis Publishing. He also financed work that won the patent for the first scanner to identify dollar bills for vending machines.
For 42 years he published newsletters on Italy's economy and its tourism. He also ran a magazine on Italian trade for the American Chamber of Commerce for Trade and he published books on opera. He wrote for Italian newspapers in the United States and Italy and also ran a business distributing hundreds of foreign periodicals in the United States.
Mr. Treves led fund-raising to help Florence after a flood, organized the American Committee on the Centennial for the Unity of Italy and was treasurer of the Italy-America Society.
Surviving are his wife of 51 years, the former Renata Colombo; a son, Charles, and a daughter, Vivian, both of Manhattan; a brother, Gino of Princeton, N.J., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Builders of Houses Fall From Favor

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
MORTGAGE rates are plummeting, which ought to be good news for home builders. But Wall Street is again turning a cold shoulder to the industry, fearing that consumers' lack of confidence will stem the tide of buying.
An index of home-builder stocks has fallen 15 percent since its recent high in early August, and the spurt in prices that followed the last cut in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve Board has evaporated. 
 That Americans are reluctant to buy homes, despite the low interest rates, is shown by statistics maintained by the Mortgage Bankers Association. It reported last week that applications for new mortgages -- not for refinancings -- were down 14 percent from July 24, when the stocks crested on the wave of the enthusiasm generated by the last discount rate cut, which the Fed made on July 2.
"Mortgage rates are the lowest they have been in 20 years," said Ed Yardeni, the chief economist of C. J. Lawrence. "That's the good news. The bad news is that job insecurity, if we could measure it, might be at its highest level since the 1930's."
Moreover, while fixed-rate mortgages now are below 8 percent in many areas, and at 7.5 percent or even lower in some, that rate may not seem as attractive as it once would have, said Gregory A. Nejmeh, who analyzes the home-building industry for Lehman Brothers. House prices, he noted, "are not rising at nearly that pace." Slow price growth has brought about a change of perception on the likelihood of profit from trading up in the housing market.
Hoping to profit is not, of course, the only reason to buy a house. It is primarily a consumption expenditure, and that remains the case. But for many homeowners, the only way to move up to a bigger and better house is to use appreciated equity in the old house. There is a lot less of that around these days.
Whatever the reason, it is clear that Wall Street's on-again, off-again love affair with the home-builder stocks is waning, although hatred toward the group is nothing like it was back in the fall of 1990. A buyer of home stocks at the lows that autumn would have more than tripled his money by the time the stocks peaked in February of this year, amid widespread expectations that the economy was soon to revive. During the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500 index was up just 35 percent.
But after that, the home-builder stocks began to slide, on spreading suspicion that this recovery was not going to be a normal one. The index fell sharply in early spring, regained some of its losses after the Fed acted in July, but then slipped back.
Since the February peak, the index, which includes 11 builders, is down 28 percent while the S.& P. 500 is up 2 percent.
The most controversial home-building stock now is the Lennar Corporation, which has the distinction of being the largest home builder in Dade County in Florida. Unlike the situation in most of America, in Lennar's primary market there will be plenty of demand for houses in coming months, and that fact initially sent the company's stock up in the wake of Hurricane Andrew.
But then word spread that angry owners of homes previously built by Lennar were suing, claiming that more homes would have survived had they been built right. Lennar is now down 24 percent from its post-hurricane peak. It closed Friday at $23.50, down 50 cents. Mr. Nejmeh is a firm bull. "There is an element of earnings visibility that does not exist for other companies," he said.
Other home builders have more prosaic problems. Some of the worst recent performers have been those with big stakes in California, a state where nothing seems to be going right. The Standard-Pacific Corporation, based in Costa Mesa, Calif., has fallen 30 percent since industry prices last peaked, on Aug. 6. Kaufman & Broad Home of Los Angeles is off 26 percent.
It is, of course, unlikely that Americans will stop wanting to move into newer and better homes. But the question confronting Wall Street is when that desire will be converted into action. At the moment, investors are far from confident that the action will come very soon.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy For Gaylord

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Gaylord Container Corporation has filed a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after failing to get a minimum number of bondholders to approve an offer to exchange its debt for new securities.
Gaylord, which has at least $741.7 million in debt, including $496.7 million in junk bonds, needed approval from 95 percent of its bondholders for the package to pass, but only 89 percent of the subordinated debt was tendered, the company said on Saturday. 
 "Clearly, holders of the subordinated debt opted for the prepackaged- plan alternative that binds the bondholders and, therefore, treats all holders equally," said Marvin Pomerantz, chairman and chief executive. The company filed the plan in the United States Bankruptcy Court here.
The company, formed in the 1980's through a series of acquisitions, is being hurt by low prices for its products, high raw material costs and the recession.
Under the terms of the prepackaged plan, Gaylord's bondholders will exchange their subordinated debt for about $378 million in new senior subordinated securities, six million shares of Gaylord class A common stock and 31.8 million redeemable exchangeable warrants to obtain another 31.8 million shares of class A common stock.
The terms of the exchange are the same under the bankruptcy plan as under the exchange offer, which expired on Friday, the company said.

The Adventures of Geraldo Rivera

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Geraldo Provoked! Geraldo  Strikes Back! Geraldo on Top! Geraldo Busted! Geraldo Booked! Geraldo Bailed Out! Geraldo Cleared! Geraldo Tells All!
If you haven't heard enough of Geraldo Rivera's latest accomplishment, don't despair. Details are available today on the premiere of another season of "Geraldo," the talk show that makes other talk shows seem sensible. The ostensible subject is a gathering of a ragtag bunch of Nazis, Ku Kluxers and skinheads a few weeks ago in Janesville, Wis., where Mr. Rivera was prodded in camera range by a neo-Nazi named John R. McLaughlin, and retaliated. 
 The real subject is Mr. Rivera. He proclaims the meeting a portentous occasion and bustles about interviewing an imperial wizard and some allies ("Neat outfits you have on.") and anti-Klan demonstrators ("Does it outrage you? Does it frighten you?"). The show ends with a cross-burning, behind Mr. Rivera.
The hour has its amusing moments. For example, a Klan historian reports that Abraham Lincoln freed the Jews. But the biggest joke is delivered deadpan by Mr. Rivera. After telling how sweat and blood dripped down his face, he informs the camera: "A professional nightmare had come true. I had become part of the story." One's heart goes out.
Never mind. Think of it as a late-night movie: "The Bully From Beyond Meets Narcissus."
 
'Power, Politics and Latinos' 
PBS, tomorrow at 9 P.M.
(Channel 13 in New York)
Geraldo Rivera does not figure in "Power, Politics and Latinos," which is one of the better things to be said about this earnest and elementary documentary. There are assuredly significant political implications in the fact that Hispanic Americans are fast becoming America's biggest minority, but instead of grappling with them, "Power, Politics and Latinos," co-produced by the National Latino Communications Center, devotes most of its hour to a routine account of a Democratic Party primary fight for a Los Angeles Congressional seat in June, in which a Latino beat out a Latina. You can see volunteers going door to door.
Interesting questions are raised: how do recent immigrants from countries like El Salvador, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic differ from older generations of Americans from Mexico and Puerto Rico? What is happening to the newcomers' relations with the black minority into whose neighborhoods they are moving? How will the Hispanic combination of Roman Catholic conservatism and economic need play out politically in big states like California, Texas, Florida and New York? Will many of the recent immigrants be able to work their way into the middle class at a time of deep economic difficulties? Is "empowerment," as used by some Hispanic politicians, another term for ethnic separatism? Will the Hispanic-first slogans heard here give way to more conventional politics, as it has with other immigrant groups? The beginnings of answers will have to await more inquiring reports that this one.

BYLINE: NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
For SLAVA ZAITSEV, the cataclysmic changes in the political and economic structure of the former Soviet Union drastically changed the nature of his fashion business and enabled him to show his serious art work as well.
Once Mr. Zaitsev, who is 54 years old, was the only Soviet couturier permitted by the Government to put his name on his designs, and he dressed RAISA GORBACHEV. Now she is no longer a customer, but JANE FONDA is. 
 "The current situation is not making it easier for me as a fashion designer, because prior to the recent changes my fashion house was the largest in Russia and was entirely financed by the Government," he said the other day, speaking from Beverly Hills, Calif. "Now I am entirely responsible personally for all financial and other aspects of running a very large business. I am paying out of my personal income."
Mr. Zaitsev's remarks were translated from Russian by SERGE SOROKKO, president of the Bowles/Sorokko Galleries, which are exhibiting his paintings and drawings this month in both Beverly Hills and New York.
A lifelong painter, Mr. Zaitsev was never free to show his art before "because his work was outside the dogmas of socialist realism," Mr. Sorokko explained. "He was permitted to paint only for his own soul. When I visited his home in Moscow, I saw 20 years of pictorial work on his walls."
Mr. Zaitsev said that he was managing to sustain his fashion house in spite of the economic distress in his country. On Saturday, some of his fashion designs were modeled in New York.
"Yes, the market is limited to just a small group," he said, "primarily the new rich, the new entrepreneurs and the still well-paid cultural elite, actors, writers and the diplomatic corps. And now, a huge amount of the clothes are acquired by foreign tourists from all over the world. Just recently Jane Fonda and TED TURNER bought some clothes from me; so did HERB RITTS, the photographer."

Japan's Barren Diplomacy

BYLINE: By LEON V. SIGAL

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Japan and Russia are letting four barren islands stand in the way of much-needed aid for Russian reform and a relaxation of tensions in Northeast Asia.
The islands in the Kurile chain, just north of Hokkaido, were snatched by Stalin after Japan's defeat in 1945. Ever since, Japan has hungered for their return. But last week Tokyo's unyielding insistence on the return of all four islands forced President Boris Yeltsin of Russia to cancel a planned visit. Japanese diplomats had ineptly defined the issue in parochial, nationalistic terms. A more moderate approach, using the islands as stepping stones to transform Russia and international relations in the region, would better serve the interests of both sides, and of the United States. 
 Postponement of the summit meeting gives the two sides time to regroup. Tokyo, which has been remarkably grudging about aid to Russia, needs to show more magnanimity. That could enable President Yeltsin to be more forthcoming on the islands. Japan, with some justice, notes that all four islands belonged to it until 1945. But Japan was prepared to cede the two larger ones in 1956 in return for a peace treaty with the Soviet Union. Only the intercession of John Foster Dulles, the U.S. Secretary of State, who feared a blurring of cold war lines, prevented that.
The Soviets later retracted their offer to return the two smaller islands, Shikotan and the Habomais, and to negotiate about the other two, Etorofu and Kunashiri. But the 1956 formula could be revived as a useful starting point for negotiations now. Those negotiations could assure that Russia's security concerns are satisfied.
But Japan has demanded that Russia acknowledge Japanese sovereignty over all four islands before offering economic assistance or investment. And it has failed to deliver on even the modest humanitarian aid pledges already made. That left reformers around Mr. Yeltsin with little to show for their efforts. And it played into the hands of their nationalist opponents who say Japan is taking advantage of Russia's weakness. Under the circumstances, Mr. Yeltsin was better off postponing his visit than risking a debacle.
That leaves him defending a Stalinist legacy that even Stalin's successors were prepared to concede. At the same time, it is perverse for a trading state like Japan, which has worked so hard to transcend borders, to put such a premium on worthless territory. As one Japanese scholar put it, "What do we want these islands for -- to put another Disneyland there?"
His is a minority voice. But others criticize Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe for negotiating in a way certain to offend proud Russians and provide few face savers.
"Japan prides itself on its pragmatism," says one leading Liberal Democratic Party politician. "Our only principle is no principle." Yet Japan managed to turn a negotiating strategy of islands first, economic cooperation second, into a matter of rigid principle. It thereby jeopardized its interests in a reformed Russia and a transformed relationship.
The island negotiations have proven Japan can say no. Japan's task now is to coax Russia to say yes.

HEADLINE: California's Water Wars

 BODY:
On the verge of a seventh consecutive year of drought, California needs a wet winter nearly as much as a lift in its economy. It also needs to shed an archaic water policy.
California is closer to water policy reforms than ever, thanks largely to Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat. He proposes creating a free market for water in which price, not policy, would determine how much would be used on farms and how much in cities. 
 Agriculture uses 80 percent of California's water to produce 10 percent of its income. Under a patchwork of Federal subsidies, some farmers barely scratch out a living while others commute in private planes to their fields from estates in southern California.
Urban water agencies rarely complained as long as the government had the money to build new dams and reservoirs. But with the state broke and the need for drought relief urgent, the mayors have parted company with the farmers. Cities are eager to compete in the marketplace for water that would otherwise be used to grow crops.
Twenty percent of that water is in the Federal delivery network of dams and canals called the Central Valley Project. Federal law prohibits resale of water already under contract to irrigation agencies. It also bars the transfer of water outside the San Joaquin Valley. The Bradley bill, and a companion measure in the House, would abolish those restrictions.
Droughts and earthquakes are California's nightmares. The difference is that droughts can be managed; the Bradley bill provides the tools.

HEADLINE: Yes, Close Homestead A.F.B.

 BODY:
It is difficult to say no to anything that could relieve the devastatation of southern Florida by Hurricane Andrew. But the Senate Appropriations Committee has rightly rejected President Bush's transparent proposal to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base.
Embarrassed by his Administration's slow response to the catastrophe, and desperate for Florida's electoral support, Mr. Bush put $480 million for the base's reconstruction in the aid package he submitted to Congress last week. The base was key to the economy of southernmost Florida. Its restoration would give the area a desperately needed lift. But, hardhearted as it may seem, military need comes first. 
 Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has rightly insisted in the past that the Pentagon is not and should not be "a social welfare agency." The military value of the Homestead base was already in question before Hurricane Andrew. Homestead was on and off this year's list of base closings and has been regarded as a strong candidate for next year's list.
Now 80 percent destroyed by an act of nature, Homestead's closing makes even more sense. By the same reasoning, the Pentagon decided to abandon Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines after its devastation by a volcano.
What's more, the Administration appears to have low-balled the likely cost of rebuilding. According to Senator Jim Sasser, chairman of the Military Construction subcommittee and one of three committee Democrats who favored rebuilding, the probable cost would be $300 million more than the Administration says.
Besides offering to rebuild the base, Mr. Bush told Floridians that Washington would pay 100 percent of the cleanup costs eligible for Federal aid, instead of the normal 75 percent. Then he granted Louisiana equal treatment, even though its losses were much less serious. And then, inspired by the President, Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina got the Appropriations Committee to vote retroactive equal treatment for Hurricane Hugo in 1989 -- another $35 million.
In an election year, the political will to relieve suffering knows few limits. All the more credit to the senators -- Democrats and Republicans -- who had the courage to curb President Bush's self-serving generosity.

DATELINE: Needed: A China Policy WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On the eve of the crucial 14th Party Congress in Beijing, when Chinese reformers behind Deng Xiaoping need all the help they can to wrest control from the totalitarians, the Bush Administration's China policy has disintegrated.
I happen to think it was a bad policy, but at least it was a policy. Throughout his term, President Bush -- claiming expertise based on his experience as our Ambassador to the People's Republic -- has refused to put pressure on China to couple economic and political freedom. 
 After Tiananmen, Mr. Bush pretended to protest by having his Secretary of State say that all subsequent high-level contact had been cut off. Secretary Baker's flat lie -- no other word is accurate -- was to conceal from the U.S. the clandestine visits to China by Brent Scowcroft and Larry Eagleburger. That homage made hypocritical our public protests.
When the Congress voted to remove most-favored-nation trade benefits in retaliation for the crackdown on dissent, Mr. Bush vetoed the bill -- showing Beijing's hard-liners that the advancement of human freedom in China was not high on the American agenda.
The President's rationale for this kowtowing was that it paid to maintain contact, that pressure might backfire, that good business would ultimately produce civilized behavior.
As Vice President a decade ago, Mr. Bush gave impetus to this policy of steady stroking by actively supporting the U.S-China joint communique of 1982. This was our sellout of Taiwan; with Mr. Bush firmly "in the loop," the U.S. promised in writing to limit sales of fighter planes to the island that has resisted Communism for a half-century.
The Chinese set great store by these communiques; this agreement was the third building block in the new relationship begun by Nixon and Kissinger in 1972. It was a great victory on the road to intimidating and taking over the 14 million Chinese on Taiwan, many of whom wish to remain free.
Last week, George Bush stunned the other signatory by abrogating the agreement. Not for any noble cause of human freedom; it was just that there was this plant in Fort Worth, Tex., producing F-16 fighters, that needed Taiwan's business. Votes in Texas outweighed America's word in the world, and Mr. Bush found some phony excuse -- not mentioned in the communique -- to break our solemn undertaking.
The Chinese will pursue nuclear sales to Iran, pay even less attention to our pleas to release dissidents, and might -- if they really want to hit where it hurts at election time -- stop buying wheat from American farmers.
And for what? To buy some votes in Fort Worth? This is a clear case of undermining our national interest and our international credibility to save a candidacy. As a result, the vaunted Bush China policy has run aground; a new tack has to be taken.
This week, the Senate will move to attach human-rights conditions to China trade; this time, the President should refrain from vetoing it. In for a dime, in for a dollar: if we are to stick it to Beijing, at least let's do it for a high purpose.
Today, the Commission on Broadcasting to the P.R.C. presents its report to the White House and Congress. The State Department wants all such broadcasting done by its Voice of America, where editorials are vetted by the mushmouth brigade. Human-rights supporters want the kind of hard-hitting "home service" done by Radio Free Europe, doing the reporting that local media would do if there were no repression.
The commission will come down on the side of a R.F.E.-style Radio Free Asia, though it is willing to defer to Chinese politburo sensibilities by calling it "Asia Democracy Radio." John Hughes, who was appointed by Mr. Bush to chair the commission, once headed the Voice; he tells me, "R.F.E. really knows how to do this stuff, and V.O.A. just doesn't have the experience." In his latest book, Richard Nixon agrees.
State wants control so as not to offend; R.F.E. wants the job to do the job well, which may irritate Beijing. President Bush has been waffling, awaiting the commission's advice.
It's here, in time to be part of a new China policy. We have had four years of no success with secret contacts and one-way trade; this is the time for the President to make the best of his shameful abrogation and to tell the Chinese leaders that the next four years will be different.

HEADLINE: Economy and the Family Are the Same Subject

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is a mistake to treat "family values" and the economy as different issues, as you do in, for instance, "Women Get Into Political Football -- as the Ball" (The Week in Review, Aug. 23). The Republican and Democratic parties are both playing the old domestic ideology card, a game that goes back at least to Aristotle in creating a pretense of a separate public realm for men and a private one for women. The realms are integrated. Public policies controlled by elite men establish the conditions of our private lives. 
 The point of the game nowadays is not, as then, to isolate almost all women at home. Our society couldn't function if many women were not out in the labor force. But employers easily rationalize giving women low-paying jobs when well-publicized propaganda proclaims that women belong at home, devoted primarily to child rearing, husband care and home management. Most women, even during economic expansion, get dreary jobs in factories and offices.
The propaganda preserves men's dominance in the economy, in politics and at home. At the same time, men are pressured to stay at jobs, no matter how distasteful; men need work and wages better than women's in order to feel masculine. If enough women and men buy into the game, the structure of the political economy is sustained, even in deep recessions and even when a few women earn good incomes or enter politics.
The Republican National Convention headlined the wives of the candidates at the top of the ticket and struck out the choice of abortion. For the Democrats, Gov. Bill Clinton's wife promised to model women's domestic role if he is elected.
Meanwhile, both parties avoid important public policy changes that would expand the limitations on women's (and men's) choices. Neither party offers pay equity, universal child care, paid maternal and family leave, national health care, regulation of technological developments and management practices to diminish their oppressive qualities or restructuring work, hours and pay -- changes that would promote the value of individuals and families. For such changes, we will need a new party.

HEADLINE: Too Soon to Extol Africa for Wisdom

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Wisdom of Africa" (editorial, Sept. 3) extols African regimes as examples for the rest of us: they have kept their colonial borders intact through the more than 30 years since empire. Eastern Europe, on the other hand, has in the less than three years since the fall of the Berlin Wall atomized, and it continues to do so. You recommend that we should learn of the wisdom of African ways. 
 Only those schooled in the simple-minded feel-good of today's multiculturalism could fail to see through the simple-mindedness of your editorial. You pay scant attention to a more prominent fact of African life and politics: the violence and brutality that has so bloodily marked the postcolonial history of much of the African continent. This is certainly deserving of more mention than you are willing to make.
Recall such instances as the pogrom against "Asians" (as subcontinental Indians are called in Africa) in Idi Amin's Uganda, tribal-inspired power struggles in pre- and post-Ian Smith Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), the Angolan war and many others too numerous to list.
There is no reliable count, but the number of deaths since 1960 attributable to violence between factions of despots fighting those of future despots has been estimated by reliable journalists as easily more than 15,000. A few of those victims contributed choice bodily parts to the freezer of President for Life Amin. And then there are the food shortages and famines that are results of war and disastrous economic planning. So much for the "wisdom of Africa."
Africa has suffered much injustice and hardship under foreign domination, but do not go overboard with guilt-inspired praise for the status quo. Stable national borders are good, but do not equate such stability with good government. Mapmakers are not the Maytag repairman. An easy time for cartographers does not mean that all is well and that virtue has prevailed.

HEADLINE: Rivals Hope Redistricting Cuts Bill Green's Edge

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
Four Democratic candidates are vying for the right to challenge Bill Green, the Republican Congressman who for 14 years has kept his grip on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the area known as the Silk Stocking district.
Mr. Green has no challengers in his party's primary this year, but the Democratic primary, and the new lines that have thrown sections of Queens and Brooklyn into what is now the 14th District, make the outcome of the general election this November less certain than in the past. 
 "The unknown element in the race is the places that have been added on," said Norman Adler, a Democratic consultant. "None of the candidates, including Green, are known there."
The four Democrats are Carolyn B. Maloney, a City Council member who is best known for her investigations of the city's sludge contracts; Abraham J. Hirschfeld, a real-estate developer; Charles W. Juntikka, a personal bankruptcy lawyer, and Frederick D. Newman, a psychotherapist and a founder of the New Alliance Party.
 
Running More Against Green
 Ms. Maloney, the only candidate who has held public office in New York before (Mr. Hirschfeld did serve as a Commissioner of Miami Beach), is generally considered the front-runner in the primary.
As she tours the district, paying particular attention to its newest neighborhoods -- Roosevelt Island in Manhattan; Astoria and Long Island City in Queens, and Greenpoint, Brooklyn -- Ms. Maloney seems to be running more against Bill Green than against her fellow Democrats.
"People are upset over the economy, and the Bush-Quayle-Green team got us there," she said. "Bill Green has voted lock, stock and barrel for economic measures that have harmed this city. He's voted his party, not his city."
The three other Democrats are focusing on Mr. Green, too, but they are also battling obscurity.
 
'Only a Builder Can Do It'
 Mr. Hirschfeld, a flamboyant figure who has been known to spit at reporters when he disagrees with them, is better known than the others, having amassed a considerable fortune in real estate. He ran for Lieutenant Governor in 1986 (he was thrown off the ballot after Gov. Mario M. Cuomo challenged his petitions, and now says that Mr. Cuomo "behaved very badly"), for the United States Senate in 1974 and 1976, and for the City Council in 1977.
The 72-year-old Mr. Hirschfeld lives lavishly, on 63d Street and Fifth Avenue, and considers Elaine's his favorite restaurant. Indeed, it was when walking home from Elaine's one night this summer that he decided to run for Congress.
"I was on 86th Street and I couldn't believe it," he recalled over lunch recently. "Every store was closed, the homeless were sleeping in the sidewalk, and bums were roaming the streets. I didn't intend to run for this office, but when I saw how bad the area was doing I thought something must be done, and only a builder can do it."
Mr. Juntikka, 38, is also concerned about the city's economy, but from a different perspective -- as a lawyer handling personal bankruptcy cases. "I think people of good will have to step forward to run," said Mr. Juntikka, who describes himself as "Jerry Brown with a smile."
Refusing to accept PAC money ("not that PACs are bending over backwards to donate money to me," he admitted) and vowing that if elected, he would not accept the $40,000 raise that Congress approved for itself, Mr. Juntikka supports a universal health-care system and hopes to spend some $100,000, much of it his own, on the race.
"It's maybe better not to rely on the Democratic machine, but on someone who has the right ideas and a good heart," he said in a telephone interview last week.
 
Opportunity for Independents
 The fourth candidate, Mr. Newman, ran on the New Alliance Party line for Mayor in 1985, for Senator in 1986 and for Attorney General in 1990.
"The fundamental issue is the issue of democracy in our electoral process," said Madeline Chapman, a party spokeswoman. "He's running because this year is an opportunity for independent Democrats, Independents, and insurgency candidates to make a mark."
Mr. Newman practices a form of therapy known as social therapy, which holds that society itself can cause people's problems. He favors election law reform and term limits for elected officials. He also believes, Ms. Chapman said, that there should be sexual parity in politics -- that a woman should be elected from a district every other term.
A short trip with Ms. Maloney to the Village View housing development on the Lower East Side the other day showed the difficulty of campaigning in a district where the incumbent is extremely well known and in a race that few people seem to have heard about.
 
'Not Really Familiar'
 As Ms. Maloney dispensed her literature, praising her record on the City Council contracts committee and on women's issues, the people sitting on shady benches said tentatively that they had maybe heard of Bill Green, but that was about it.
"I'm not really familiar with this race," said Rebecca High, putting down her groceries to peer at the pamphlets. "Is this the one that Ferraro and . . . "
Ms. Maloney had heard the question before. "That's the Senate," she said.
Most of the residents seemed to have a vague, benign attitude toward Mr. Green. "This is the first time I've seen this lady," said Rose Beron. "Bill Green -- he's a nice man; he comes down to the neighborhood here."
She asked a question that makes Ms. Maloney, and all the other primary candidates, cringe: "He's a Democrat, isn't he?"

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Readies Answer to Bush On Draft Issue

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EUGENE, Ore., Sept. 14

 BODY:
Choosing to confront an issue he had declared himself finished with three weeks ago, Bill Clinton abruptly altered his campaign schedule and flew from here today to defend himself against an anticipated attack by President Bush on the subject of Mr. Clinton and the draft during the Vietnam War.
It was not at all clear that Mr. Bush would attack Mr. Clinton directly. One Bush campaign official, Leslie Goodman, a deputy director of communications, said she firmly expected it. But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, obviously pleased by Mr. Clinton's consternation, was deliberately vague. 
 And privately, Bush aides traveling with the President in Oregon suggested this evening that Mr. Bush would probably not attack Mr. Clinton's draft record directly -- at least not now.
 
Feeling Vulnerable
 What was clear was that the mere fear of an attack was enough to send his Democratic rival rushing to counter any possible move by the President, underscoring how vulnerable the Democratic nominee feels about his escape from military induction in 1969, and his changing explanations of his actions that year.
Mr. Clinton, who had earlier declined an invitation to speak before the National Guard Association meeting in Salt Lake City this week, changed his mind this morning after learning that Mr. Bush had decided to replace Vice President Dan Quayle as the convention's schedule speaker on Tuesday morning, Clinton campaign aides said.
Ms. Goodman said in a telephone interview that the President would discuss Mr. Clinton and the draft on the issue of trust.
Bush campaign operatives see Mr. Clinton as vulnerable not so much because he did not serve in the military during the Vietnam War but because his explanations of why he did not have followed such a tortuous path since the issue arose this year.
In the early days, Mr. Clinton had a simple story: After a four-year deferment at Georgetown University, he was exposed to the draft for a relatively brief period and was lucky. He was never called.
In the months since, that story has become much more complex. Incrementally but overwhelmingly, a picture of Mr. Clinton has emerged as a young man who went to great lengths to avoid the draft and to equally great lengths to minimize that politically awkward fact in the years afterward.
The anticipation of this sort of assault led Mr. Clinton to rush to try to speak in Salt Lake City at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday, after the President's 9 A.M. speech.
The arrangement is the second such in a month; three weeks ago Mr. Clinton followed Mr. Bush in speaking before the American Legion, an occasion on which the Democrat delivered what he said was his final statement on the Vietnam War and the draft.
 
Stomping Out the Fires
 "We're not going to take any guff off of George Bush," said Paul Begala, Mr. Clinton's chief speech writer. "We are not going to let his little brush fires get started. We're going to go there and stomp them out quick."
Mr. Clinton declined to acknowledge the reason for his trip to Salt Lake City, saying only that he had always wanted to go to the National Guard convention, because he was concerned with issues that affected the guard.
When asked if he planned to respond to any attack by President Bush, Mr. Clinton replied: "I have no idea what he's going to say. I only know he's going to go there. But I expect inconsistency."
Mr. Clinton's decision to fly to Salt Lake City interrupts a scheduled three-day West Coast political tour.
The candidate was enthusiastically received by tens of thousands of people in a morning rally in downtown Portland, Ore., where he focused on the economy, which he regards as Mr. Bush's great weakness.
 
Interview With Don Imus
 What may have been a preview of Mr. Clinton's remarks to the National Guard Association came in an early morning interview today with a New York talk-show host, Don Imus.
This morning, as he sat in his kitchen after his daily jogging session, Mr. Clinton was interviewed by Mr. Imus through a telephone hookup. It was Mr. Imus's friendly interview during the New York primary in April that helped Mr. Clinton retool a badly damaged public image.
Now, after several weeks of more questions about the draft, at the beginning of a week in which the Republicans are expected to redouble their attack on the subject, Mr. Clinton turned to Mr. Imus again.
"Let me ask you about the draft," Mr. Imus said. "Anything you wish you did differently back in 1969 or that you said differently during the campaign?"
The candidate replied: "In terms of whether I could have handled it better in the beginning of the campaign, I think there's no question about that. You know, I'd like to explain why I didn't do such a good job of it. I didn't go back through all my letters, notes, to try to put this all back together again because this issue has been raised on me before in Arkansas. And, when it had, everybody involved back when all the players were still living, everybody who had been involved in it, said that I did nothing wrong. And no one involved in it in all the years I was running ever suggested I did anything wrong until the beginning of this year.
"And so I think I was always kind of playing catch up because I gave a lot of answers to questions kind of off the top of my head, halfway on the run when the press would hit me. And you don't remember everything after 23 years, every detail and every specific."
 
Blaming His Enemies
 He went on at far greater length than he had in addressing the issue in recent weeks, blaming assorted Republicans and political enemies for spreading stories about him.
When the question first began making national news last spring, Mr. Clinton stayed with the story he began telling in 1978 when the matter was first raised, during the Arkansas governor's race that year. His political opponent accused him of having avoided the draft by gaining a deferment through enrolling in the Reserve Officer's Training Corps program at the University of Arkansas in 1969.
Mr. Clinton replied that after a four-year deferment from the draft granted while he was a undergraduate student at Georgetown University, he was eligible for induction while a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in England but had been fortunate enough to never receive the call.
The matter rested largely unexplored until February 1992, when The Wall Street Journal printed a lengthy article asserting that Mr. Clinton had in fact gained a crucial deferment by promising in the summer to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps program at the University of Arkansas in 1969. The article said Mr. Clinton's promise to attend the University of Arkansas Law School and participate in the R.O.T.C. program there had won him a change in his draft status, shielding him from the draft.
Having secured the deferment, Mr. Clinton broke his promise, choosing not to enroll at the University of Arkansas after all, or to join the R.O.T.C. program, but to remain another year in Oxford and then go to Yale Law School, The Journal said.
In response to the article, Mr. Clinton said he decided in September or October of 1969 that it would be wrong for him to take the R.O.T.C. deferment, when other young men he knew were taking their chances on the draft. "I had high school classmates who were already dead," he said. "I decided it was an inappropriate thing to do."
So, he said, he informed Col. Eugene L. Holmes, the director of the R.O.T.C. program, that he would not participate in R.O.T.C.; he did this in September, or early October, he recalled. On Oct. 30, his draft status was changed from 1-D deferment to 1-A eligibility.
It is not, however, entirely clear when he told the R.O.T.C. program that he would not attend. While he said he told Colonel Holmes in the early fall, Lieut. Col. Clinton D. Jones, Colonel Holmes's deputy and the director of procurement for the University of Arkansas R.O.T.C. program, said in an interview last week that neither he nor Colonel Holmes knew of Mr. Clinton's change of heart until they received a letter in December, after he drew a high number in the draft lottery, protecting him from being called up.
Within a few days of the first article, The Journal challenged Mr. Clinton's explanation with the December letter. In the letter, Mr. Clinton offered an explanation for his decision to risk exposure to the draft that contradicted what he had told The Journal.
"I decided to accept the draft despite my political beliefs for one reason: to maintain my political viability within the system," the 23-year-old Mr. Clinton wrote.
 
A Friend's Letters
 The story turned another corner in April, when The Los Angeles Times printed excerpts from letters Clifford Jackson wrote to friends in the spring of 1969. Mr. Jackson, a Little Rock lawyer who was a Fulbright Scholar at Oxford when Mr. Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar, says he and others helped Mr. Clinton put together an aggressive campaign to secure the R.O.T.C. slot after Mr. Clinton received an induction notice in late April 1969.
The excerpts from Mr. Jackson's letters described a young Mr. Clinton in the spring of 1969 as "feverishly trying to find a way to avoid entering the Army as a drafted private," with Mr. Jackson enlisting "several of my friends in influential positions, trying to pull strings on Bill's behalf," and with Mr. Clinton ultimately "wiggling his way back to Oxford."
More importantly, the excerpts also contained this line: "Bill Clinton, friend and Rhodes received an induction notice." This forced Mr. Clinton to make his third significant amendment to his explanation, admitting that he had received an induction notice.
Previously, in dozens of interviews on the subject of the draft, Mr. Clinton had never mentioned the induction notice, and at least twice he had denied having ever been called up.
In acknowledging his induction, Mr. Clinton said that he had received the notice late after the call-up date had passed and that he had therefore been able to secure a delay until July 28, which gave him time to return to Arkansas and secure the R.O.T.C. deferment. "I gladly would have told you this, if it had even occurred to me that this was relevant," he told reporters.
Mr. Jackson's assertion that Mr. Clinton arranged a campaign of political influence to secure the delay and the R.O.T.C. slot is unproven and has been denied by Mr. Clinton.
After dropping from public view for several months, the draft issue came back two weeks ago, when The Los Angeles Times published an article asserting that Mr. Clinton's uncle, Raymond Clinton, had led a political lobbying effort to gain his nephew a slot in the Naval Reserve program in Hot Springs, Ark., in an effort to help protect Mr. Clinton until he secured the R.O.T.C. deferment.
In his immediate responses to questions on the matter, Mr. Clinton said repeatedly that the assertions in The Times article were a surprise to him. "It's all news to me," he said, and "I know nothing about it."

The American College of Physicians, the largest medical specialty group in the United States, said today that there should be an overall national limit on health-care spending, with new restrictions on the amounts charged by doctors and hospitals.
The proposal signals a turning point in the debate over the future of the American health-care system because it indicates that significant numbers of doctors now support an approach favored by many labor unions, big businesses and Democratic members of Congress. 
 Under the proposal, all employers would be required to provide health insurance for their workers or to pay a new tax to finance a public health plan in which the employees could enroll. Private and public health insurers would offer a uniform set of benefits, covering "all medically effective and appropriate care." Hospitals and doctors would negotiate payment schedules with insurers and others who pay for their services.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential nominee, also favors a comprehensive budget for all health-care spending, public and private alike. President Bush vehemently opposes the idea, saying it will lead to stringent rationing of health care, and he regularly denounces the idea in campaign speeches.
 
'Times Have Changed'
 The college, which is composed of 77,000 doctors who specialize in internal medicine, unveiled the proposal today in its journal, The Annals of Internal Medicine. In the plan, it goes further than the American Medical Association, which wants to require employers to provide health insurance but does not support a national health-care budget with limits on doctors' fees.
Historically, doctors have opposed efforts by Government, insurers and businesses to regulate their fees. But Dr. Willis C. Maddrey, president of the American College of Physicians, said, "Today we acknowledge that times have changed."
Nonetheless, Dr. Raymond Scalettar, chairman of the American Medical Association, sharply criticized the proposal. "The college's plan is a thinly veiled Clinton-style proposal, a radical approach rather than the incremental reform that is necessary," he said.
In May, the Journal of the American Medical Association published an editorial saying that the United States should set an annual limit, or ceiling, on health-care spending, "no matter how distasteful or politically dangerous that may seem to be." But the editorial did not reflect the official position of the association.
Many medical groups have issued blueprints for the nation's health-care system, but the college's plan is the most specific about how to control costs.
The college said many doctors would accept lower fees in return for more professional freedom and less second-guessing by insurance companies. "Physicians will accept the constraints necessary in a reformed system, particularly to control costs, if there is an end to the overwhelming regulatory intrusion that dominates practice today," it said.
 
Consulting on Many Sides
 In developing the plan, the college's 28-member board consulted a wide range of business and labor groups, circulated questionnaires among 4,500 members of the college and met with its chapters from all 50 states. Officers of the organization said the proposal accurately reflected the members' growing concern about health costs.
Dr. John R. Ball, executive vice president of the college, said his group's proposal embodied five years of work and was not intended as an endorsement of Mr. Clinton. "I don't think this is a Republican or a Democratic plan," said Dr. Ball. "It's a bipartisan plan."
 
'A Matrix' of Controls
 To control costs, the college said: "We must limit total health-care spending through a national health-care budget and a matrix of national and local controls on the price, supply and demand for health services. We must adopt a national health-care budget -- a ceiling on total health expenditures."
It did not say exactly how it would calculate the national health budget. But it said that current spending on health care, $800 billion, or 14 percent of gross domestic product, was enough for this year.
The plan suggested that state officials would develop a health-care budget for each state. Dr. Ball said the medical profession would police the new limits on spending and doctors' fees. If doctors failed to enforce compliance, then Federal and state officials might become involved, he said.
While requiring employers to buy health insurance for employees, the college would lighten the burden in three ways. If employers chose to provide private insurance, they would not have to cover retirees or employees 60 years old and over, and they would not have to pay catastrophic costs, defined as those exceeding $50,000 a year for one person. The new publicly sponsored health program, consolidating Medicare and Medicaid, would pay such costs.
These elements of the college's proposal address President Bush's concern that new Federal mandates for health insurance would impose a crushing burden on small businesses and would lead to job losses.
Gail R. Wilensky, deputy assistant to the President for policy development, said the proposal was "absolutely contrary to what we are doing." Asked if the President could endorse cost controls of the type proposed by the college, Dr. Wilensky said, "Not a chance."

HEADLINE: GERMAN RATE CUT;
GERMAN RATES CUT, SETTING OFF SURGE IN WORLD MARKETS

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Germany's powerful central bank cut its high interest rates slightly today -- less than many political leaders and economists had hoped -- but even the small cut was enough to provoke a strong worldwide rally in stocks.
The modest cuts, a half-point in one rate and a quarter-point in another, were the Bundesbank's first in five years and seemed as much a nod to the French vote on Sunday on the treaty on European unity as a change in Germany's long-term strategy. 
 Because the high German interest rates have drawn off money from other countries and stifled business investment, even the small step today was seized on by investors as cause for optimism -- that rates might come down more but certainly would not go higher. After the announcement, the German stock market rose 4.4 percent, and the French, Belgian and Italian markets gained more than 3.5 percent each. [In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.52 points, or 2.1 percent.] Bonds and the dollar also rallied in world markets.
 
German Rates Remain High
 But the gains today and the optimism surrounding them would almost certainly evaporate if the French reject the unification treaty.
And even with the cuts, German rates remain high. The Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's ceiling on short-term rates, was cut to 9.5 percent from 9.75 percent; the discount rate, at which commercial banks borrow from the central bank, was cut to 8.25 percent from 8.75 percent.
These cuts by themselves are not sufficient to jump-start the economies of Europe or the United States, economists said. Rather, they said, it would take a series of interest-rate reductions, in Germany and in other nations, at a time when most governments are grappling with large fiscal deficits as well as their monetary problems.
 
Tightfisted Policies
 But the symbolism seemed as important as the actual size of the cuts. The Bundesbank is famed for its tightfisted, anti-inflationary policies and its independence from political pressures, and it has been willing to hold German interest rates at high levels with no regard for the effect on its fellow members of the European Community and the rest of the world economy.
The high German rates had been blamed for snuffing out any chance of economic recovery in Europe by forcing other nations to keep their rates high to defend the value of their currencies. Even the modest drop in German rates gives other nations more flexibility to lower their own rates, or at least avert an increase. In the United States, for example, the Federal Reserve might feel it has the freedom to nudge the already low interest rates lower, hoping to stimulate the economy.
Because lower rates improve the outlook for economic recovery, they foster optimism among investors, rallying the stock markets.
A healthier Europe would be beneficial to the United States by increasing demand for goods from American companies.
The high German rates also attracted investments from other countries, strengthening the mark against other currencies and contributing to the slide of the dollar, the Italian lira and other currencies.
 
The Markets' Hope
 "It looks pretty clear that the Bundesbank has done the minimum it can get away with," said Nigel Gault, the chief European economist for DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm. "But the markets seem to be looking at it with the hope that German rates have peaked and will now trend down."
The Bundesbank had shocked the financial markets with its statement on Sunday night that it would reduce rates today. But it did not reveal then how large the cuts would be. Its commitment to reducing rates was made as part of a coordinated effort in the European Community to stabilize currency markets by devaluing the Italian lira, the weakest of the leading European currencies.
In currency trading today, the dollar posted solid gains and the lira surged. Indeed, Europe's central banks were forced to buy British pounds because that currency slipped so sharply against the lira.
"There may have been some disappointment in the markets because there had been some people saying that the Bundesbank might push down rates 1 or 2 percent, but in my opinion that was never realistic," said Ulrich Beckmann, an economist at Deutsche Bank A.G. in Frankfurt. "Otherwise, the markets have reacted very positively."
 
Sign of Cooperation
 Proponents of closer European unification seized on the shift as a sign that nations could put aside their conflicting economic agendas to work together.
With just six days left until the French referendum on the European union treaty, which was agreed to by the leaders of the 12 European Community nations in the Dutch town of Maastricht last year, Government officials campaigning in favor of a "yes" vote portrayed the move as proof that Germany, Europe's economic engine, could be counted on as a partner in a more unified community.
"The spirit of Maastricht has prevailed over purely national interests," Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy of France said.
Opponents of the Maastricht treaty, however, said the modest size of the reductions and the continuing uncertainty in the markets simply proved that it was unwise to allow Germany, in effect, to set monetary policy throughout Europe.
 
'Bit of a Cosmetic Exercise'
 "This proves that this was perhaps just a bit of a cosmetic exercise, and it underlines the fact that the European finance ministers have little control on the market," said John Carlisle, a Conservative member of the British Parliament.
Economists were divided on the significance of the decision by the Bundesbank to cut rates within days of reasserting its longheld position that vigilance against inflation precluded moves to spur more economic growth.
Some said the bank was making a historic change in policy by putting international considerations ahead of its inflation-fighting mandate. But others said it was probably motivated by a recognition that the German economy had slowed even more than the bank had earlier recognized, and that a small reduction could be justified.
If the French reject the Maastricht treaty on Sunday, economists said, the currency markets will plunge into turmoil. If the push for European unification ends, they said, currency traders would no longer put so much faith in the determination of European nations to keep inflation low and exchange rates stable -- and will pull investments out of vulnerable currencies like the pound.

HEADLINE: 11-Year-Old Boy Finds Parents Dead In Bronx Apartment

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
An 11-year-old Bronx boy arrived home from school yesterday afternoon to discover his mother and father shot to death in the living room of the family's apartment. His 2-month-old brother lay unharmed in a stroller inches from the bodies, the police said.
Investigators said last night that they had no idea why the couple were killed. The man, Nestor Julio Puente Mello, 31 years old, was shot in the head and abdomen, and his wife, Isabel Perez, 34, was shot in the head and neck. 
 Lieut. James Malvey, the commanding officer of the 44th Detective Squad said there was no sign of a forced entry at the apartment, on the top floor of a six-story building at 306 East 171st Street in what he described as a violent section of Morrisania plagued by killings and drug-dealing. There was no indication that robbery was the motive, the lieutenant said; the orderly apartment was virtually undisturbed and cash and jewelry remained untouched.
Adding to the mystery,the lieutenant said, was that there was no sign of struggle, even though Mr. Mello was a prize-winning body builder.
For this reason, Lieutenant Malvey said, "We have reason to believe they knew who the shooters were."
The police and neighbors said they knew little about the family, which had moved in about six months ago. Both parents were believed to be Dominican immigrants. Mr. Mello was unemployed, Lieutenant Malvey said, and Ms. Perez was living on welfare. The children were moved to the home of a relative last night.

HEADLINE: THE GERMAN RATE CUT;
German Cut Not Seen as Quick Cure

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
The Bundesbank's decision to cut German interest rates was hailed in dozens of world capitals as a move that will spur growth in Europe and beyond. But the cuts are not so sizable that economists expect them to fuel a quick or strong turnaround.
Where the rate cuts might help most, Bush Administration officials and economists said, is by steadying volatile exchange rates and calming the world's jittery markets. 
 The consensus is that the world is in for at least one more year of sluggish growth. Still, every bit of stimulus helps, and even a modest German rate cut cannot be sneezed at.
 
Prelude to I.M.F. Meeting
 The Bundesbank's decision came just days before the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank here, where the more than 150 member nations had been expected to cast Germany as the villain for slowing world growth. Now some of the heat is off.
For the United States, any slightly faster growth in Europe could nudge America's sluggish economy ahead a bit faster. But such effects are not likely to be felt for several months.
"We won't get a healthy European economy instantaneously," said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "This will help solve it, but it will take some time." He added that "a healthy European economy will in the medium term be good for American exports" because European consumers and businesses will buy more American goods once Europe's economy picks up.
The Bundesbank move, along with Japan's decision last month to pursue an $86 billion fiscal stimulus program, are steps toward ending the global slump. But there seems no question that the Japanese have taken the bolder move.
With its ability to stimulate the American economy hamstrung by the $320 billion Federal budget deficit, the Bush Administration can do little more than put pressure on other nations and encourage the Federal Reserve to cut rates at home.
But the German interest rate cuts should give the Fed new flexibility. On Sept. 4, the Fed settled for a rate cut of one-fourth of a percentage point rather than a larger one, economists say, because of concerns that the dollar was near record lows against the mark.
In a news briefing today, a senior Administration official who insisted on anonymity said the Bundesbank's move showed that nations still cooperate to foster growth. He said the German central bank had listened to repeated appeals from the Bush Administration and Europe.
"This is a pretty good example of successful policy coordination," the official said.
To be sure, a German rate cut of 1 percent would do considerably more.
"It's a mistake to think that a rate cut of half a point is going to be enough to bring about a resumption of rapid global growth," said Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist at the World Bank.
Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community's executive commission, welcomed the Bundesbank move but said it was just a "gesture." It seems only a matter of time before the United States and Germany's European partners start putting pressure on the Bundesbank to ratchet rates still lower.
"The Bundesbank rate cut still leaves the countries of Europe with rather little room for maneuver," said William R. Cline of the Institute for International Economics.
Many economists say the Bundesbank will not cut rates much more until the German Government slashes its budget deficit, which is stoking inflationary pressures. The deficit mushroomed largely because of Bonn's efforts to finance the reconstruction of eastern Germany.
But cutting budget deficits is the kind of painful step that many countries, the United States pre-eminentamong them, are reluctant to take in the name of international cooperation. For years, Washington's allies have pressed it to cut its deficit sharply to help bring down long-term interest rates around the world and to provide more money for private investment.
While Americans do not seem willing to swallow the bitter pill of deficit reduction, many still hope the Germans will take this medicine.

HEADLINE: Fond Memories of the Bronx of Yore;
Many of Its Natives Are Long Gone, but the Old Borough Is Not Forgotten

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Charles Medwin was like many people who grew up in the Bronx in the 40's, 50's and 60's: He couldn't wait to get out. But now that Mr. Medwin, a retired New York City police sergeant, lives in Las Vegas, Nev., he drives a car with "BRONX4" on the license plate. He is also a card-carrying member of the Bronx Historical Society, and eagerly looks forward to news clippings about the Bronx sent by friends in New York.
"I get people honking at me all the time, even the cops," Mr. Medwin said. "There's a common bond. See, you didn't really appreciate it when you were there, but you appreciated it later."
 
Down Memory Lane
 
 Like former Bronxites scattered all over the country, Mr. Medwin revels in Bronx nostalgia. Never mind that his is a memory Bronx, that many former residents wouldn't think of walking the streets of the real thing these days. Mr. Medwin and his fellow enthusiasts are wistfully calling up memories of their old neighborhoods, hunting down friends they grew up with, even creating a cottage industry in Bronx memorabilia.
One childhood resident, who now lives in Scarsdale, N.Y., has begun publishing a nostalgia magazine, Back in the Bronx. A retired gift shop owner in Kansas City works in his daughter and son-in-law's deli, called "D'Bronx" in tribute to his home turf. A medical billing clerk in Houston, who during her last visit to the Bronx would not even get out of the car to snap a picture of her old building, is planning a Bronx reunion.
The Bronx nostalgia buffs yearn for a time before the Cross Bronx Expressway tore through the heart of the borough north of Manhattan, before the wave of Puerto Rican and black families prompted white flight in the 1970's and before Co-op City sapped away many of the remaining middle-class families.
Nevertheless, when it comes to playing the nostalgia game, Bronxites have it over every other group of New Yorkers, except perhaps Brooklynites.
"Being from the Bronx and from Brooklyn meant something," said Clint Roswell, a Bronx native who is also the spokesman for the Bronx Borough President. "Being from Queens didn't mean anything. It was an outpost. Maybe I'm just a Bronx snob. Or is that an oxymoron?"
The self-anointed voice of the movement is Back in the Bronx, a kitschy, gossipy magazine that reads like the personals and whose style is part high school year book and part hometown booster.
One issue of the magazine -- which has a circulation of 2,500 and is published sporadically, but more or less quarterly -- featured the winner of the 1962 Miss Bronx contest held at the Freedomland amusement park. There are reminiscences of the Loews Paradise Theater on the Grand Concourse, with its elegant lobby and painted ceiling. And there are endless lists of famous Bronxites like Red Buttons and Ralph Lauren, the comedian Robert Klein and the boxer Jake La Motta.
Steve Samtur, who publishes the magazine with his wife, Susan, said the idea came to him two years ago, after a reunion of Bronxites (held in the Catskills) attracted 1,200 people.
"They'll come from anywhere for these reunions," he said. "And when you come back, it's like you never left. You start up where you left off 30 or 40 years ago."
 
Claiming the Neighborhood
 All of this, Mr. Samtur says, has helped many Bronxites realize it is now acceptable to say they grew up in the much-maligned borough.
The film director Penny Marshall would not want to overdo it. "I would never call the Bronx chic, but I'm happy to say I'm from there," she says.
So happy, in fact, that Ms. Marshall, who has directed films like "A League of Their Own," "Big," and "Awakenings" -- which was filmed in the Bronx -- named her company Parkway Productions, a nod to her old Bronx neighborhood near Grand Concourse and Mosholu Parkway.
The Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, the symbol of Bronx present and probably its biggest booster today, said that while he welcomed the nostalgia for the borough's past, he wished that former Bronxites would be as hopeful about the its future as he is. He also said he was weary of outsiders, especially former Bronxites, dumping on his borough.
 
A Top Booster
 "Why I go nuts when a lot of people say stuff like that is that, one, they don't know the Bronx of today," he said. "Two, they never set foot in it and three, if it's so bad, it begs the question of why there are so many wonderful people who got their start here."
Mr. Ferrer said he would allow that there have been changes in the Bronx. "It's not good nor is it bad," he said. "It's different."
When Jeffrey Silber, who was born and raised in the Bronx, moved to Los Angeles years ago to join his brother's real-estate business, he longed for his home so much that he organized a picnic of former Bronxites. Nine hundred people showed up.
"They were looking for each other," he said. "There was a wholesale transition, and this makes the Bronx completely different from any other urban experience in America, where there isn't anybody in a 50-block area still left that you grew up with.
"There's no way for them to go back to it or to look someone up," he said. "That's what they were looking for at this picnic. They were looking for their past."
 
'Cities Within a City'
 During the period just after the Depression and before the 1970's, the Bronx was made up of neighborhoods that, while self-contained, were like one another in many ways.
"We had little cities within a city, neighborhoods within neighborhoods," said Lou Moses, who left the Bronx in 1942. Mr. Moses now lives in Kansas City, where he works at his daughter and son-in-law's deli.
"It was a big little hometown. You had all your services on one block, a bakery, candy store, and so on down the line," said Mr. Moses, whose father owned a bakery in the Tremont section.
Lloyd Ultan, a historian, said the Bronx of that era was defined by the shared aspirations of those looking for a better life, many of them leaving behind the immigrant communities of Manhattan's Lower East Side.
The Bronx was also very homogenous then. The 1930 Census, Mr. Ultan said, showed that 49 percent of the Bronx' population was Jewish. There were also large numbers of Italians and Irish. "But all were middle class in their thoughts, in their ideals, in their attitudes and thus there was a shared community in the best sense of the term."
 
Major Social Changes
 Even then, however, those who "moved up" to the Bronx looked to move on once they got there.
But in the 1970's, major social and economic forces reshaped the borough, and some former residents speak of the changes with bitterness.
"They burned it, welfared it, gouged it and then Co-op City finished it," Charles Medwin, the former Bronx police officer, said. "I blame my fellow Jews for helping to destroy the Bronx because they were afraid of the black people and they ran. They ran to Co-op City and Long Island.
"This used to be a little piece of prosperity, but they destroyed it," he said. "But we do have memories of when we were young, and they were good memories," he said.
 
Still Worth Revisiting
 Not all former Bronxites have such a grim view of its future. When Susan Hemus Hugele of Houston, who is planning a reunion of people from her neighborhood next month, returned to 1927 University Avenue in 1981, she photographed it from inside her car. After she had the film developed, she cried at what she saw.
The ground floor, which had housed a butcher's and a candy store when she was growing up, was burned out. The apartments were vacant, and the building covered with graffiti.
But when she returned last fall, the building was being rehabilitated, as was much of the Bronx, she said.
"We can't go back and relive it in the neighborhood, but we can go through and see that they're trying to make it better."
Nevertheless, when Ms. Hugele's neighborhood chums gather to reminisce next month, it will be in New Jersey, not in the Bronx.

HEADLINE: Stocks Leap by 70.52, Biggest Jump of Year

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Stock prices in the United States took their biggest leap of the year yesterday, following sharp rallies in Europe, after Bonn loosened its interest-rate tourniquet.
The Dow Jones industrial average, the main gauge of the market's strength, rose 70.52 points, or 2.1 percent, to 3,376.22, its biggest jump since an 88.10-point gain Dec. 23. Trading was the heaviest in more than six weeks, with 252.8 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, up from 180.6 million Friday. 
 Investors especially favored large industrial companies, including makers of chemicals, autos and electrical equipment, which are most likely to benefit from a stronger recovery. The rally was broad enough, however, to lift the Standard & Poor's 500, which tracks the wider market, 5.69 points, or 1.4 percent, to a record 425.27.
The Dow's gain propelled it to within 37 points of the record 3,413.21 reached June 1.
 
'Catalyst for Higher Prices'
 Economists still say that no matter what the Germans do, the United States cannot even hope for brisk economic growth until well into next year. But market analysts said the German rate cuts, and the ensuing bond market gains in the United States, were only some of the reasons for believing that stocks will continue to advance.
"What the German central bank provided was just a catalyst for higher stock prices, which were going to emerge anyway," said Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. "This rally is sustainable."
The advances on Wall Street followed gains of more than 2 percent in Tokyo and London, 4 percent in France and 4.4 percent in Germany. The Mexican Bolsa rose 48.72 points, or 3.76 percent, to 1,342.81, for its sharpest jump this year.
In the United States, market watchers saw a scene of lackadaisical investors startled into action. "Mutual fund managers have too much cash to be easily invested," said Laszlo Birinyi, whose investment consulting firm bears his name. "Anytime managers make one of these bets and it goes awry, they scurry."
Andrew Midler, who manages Fidelity's Growth and Income Fund, denied reports that his fund group had been an especially active buyer yeterday. "Yeah, Germany dropped rates by a quarter of a percent," he said. "I didn't see too much change in the world." Business conditions remain disappointing, he added.
Instead of concentrating on today's stagnant economy, Mr. Birinyi advised looking at the longer range record of a bull market that has plugged along for two years despite scant economic growth. "The stock market's like a movie, not a series of pictures," he said.
Another scene from this movie had short-sellers, who sell borrowed stock on the hope of buying it back later at lower prices, running for cover. Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company, said that New York Stock Exchange short sales had recently reached 900 million shares -- "the largest in history," he said.
Many analysts view heavy short sales as a favorable sign because all those shares have to be bought back later. When the market rises, leaving short-sellers with losses, Mr. Seagle said, "These people run very fast."
Four stocks accounted for more than a quarter of yesterday's advance in the Dow: Caterpillar, up 3 5/8, to 53; Minnesota Mining, up 3 5/8, to 103; Allied-Signal, up 2 1/2, to 55 7/8, and General Electric, up 2 3/8, to 77 1/2.
Auto makers also jumped on hopes that lower interest rates here and abroad would enliven the economy. General Motors gained 1 1/4, to 34 7/8, Ford 2 5/8, to 42 7/8, and Chrysler 1 1/8, to 22 1/2, with all three among the 10 most active stocks on the New York exchange. Ford also benefited from several recent reports highlighting the Taurus model's challenge to the Honda Accord for the top spot in United States sales.
Many of the companies that appreciated the most yesterday also depend heavily on sales abroad, which would improve if the German rate cut brings stronger growth abroad.
Banks also did well yesterday, with J. P. Morgan up 2, to 62 3/8, and Chase Manhattan, the nation's second busiest stock on dividend-related trading, up 7/8, to 23 1/8.
Broader indexes did not keep pace with the large industrial stocks in the Dow, as the Nasdaq average gained 1.92 percent. The Dow Jones utility average fell 0.44, to 221.39, as investors moved their money to stocks more likely to gain in a recovery.
Investors still dumped stocks whose prospects darkened. Symantec, the most active issue yesterday, fell 4 3/8, to 11 1/8, when it warned that said second-quarter earnings would not meet analysts' estimates. Biomet fell 1 1/4, to 16 3/4, as a Lehman Brothers analyst said profits would grow more slowly than expected.
The market rose 35 points for about half the day's gains in the opening minutes of trading, after investors heard the news from the Bundesbank and the European markets.
As the day ended, analysts spoke less of the economic than the psychological impact of Germany's move. Investors had feared that record German rates and a plummeting dollar left the Federal Reserve no more leeway to massage the American economy. The stock market's response to the German rate cuts "reflects a turn in investor expectations," said Steven G. Einhorn, chief strategist at Goldman, Sachs and Company. "At least now there is light at the end of the tunnel."
So what if economists still predict slow growth? As Mr. Clough of Merrill Lynch put it, "I've never seen an economic forecast engraved in stone."

HEADLINE: Shaking Up Old Ways of Benevolence

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
They are not Rockfellers or Mellons. But they do have money, dividends from a family business or perhaps a modest inheritance, and they want to do good with it. They do not see themselves as philanthropists, a description that they find pretentious or condescending. They prefer to speak of "sharing," rather than "giving," and they often want to get actively involved with a group in addition to writing a check.
These people, many of them in their 30's and 40's and the majority of them women, are causing new ripples to spread through conventional charitable giving. What sets them apart from past contributors is the fact that they are not going it alone, that they are seeking out other donors who share their view of society's problems -- shaped in many cases by events of the 1960's, and using this network to channel their money to groups that in many cases are too small, too radical or too inexperienced to attract help from the established philanthropies. 
 Their typical individual donations amount to no more than $50,000 annually, and their main beneficiaries are local groups that run shelters for battered women, train jobless youth, organize tenant coalitions or fight crime, drugs, racism or environmental ills.
Some are like Barbara Winslow, a Hunter College professor, who decided to use a windfall to organize an "overground railroad" helping poor women living outside New York come to the city for abortions.
 
Giving Time
 "We want to give these women transportation, get people to open their homes to them if they need a place to stay for the night and mainly see they receive safe and good medical care -- not wind up with a back-street butcher," she said.
Annette Holloway, a television producer, made a similar choice, saying, "I received this chunk of money I didn't need and seeing the city's homeless made me decide to spend some of it in my own backyard."
All of them give their money; in addition some of them give their time. Ms. Holloway works as a volunteer at New York Cares, a group that helps employed people find ways to fit community service into their crowded schedules by working evenings at food kitchens or spending weekends with students. "I don't feel I do that much, spending a day I enjoy with children from a shelter."
Both she and Ms. Winslow channel their money to the North Star Fund, a 14-year-old group based in lower Manhattan whose motto is "Change, not charity." North Star, which describes itself as an alternative to traditional foundations, like Ford, Rockefeller or Carnegie, channels aid through a board of community leaders.
Thirteen other groups like North Star operate around the country in a loosely linked network called the Funding Exchange, and most report a rise in new donors, said Cecilia Rodriguez, the exchange's executive director. Together they gave away $7 million last year, a relatively small sum measured against the $182 million that the Ford Foundation, the country's wealthiest foundation, spent last year.
"The exchange was started by a generation of men and women who were children of the 60's, people who grew up in the midst of social ferment and the civil rights movement," she said. "We're seeing another generation joining in now and they too have a passionate involvement."
Marjorie Fine, executive director of North Star, said that in the last 18 months, the number of donors who give $1,000 annually to become members has jumped from 100 to 200. And she said the organization has received a substantial number of larger gifts in the $50,000 range, enabling it to give away $600,000 last year, for example, to groups organizing new immigrants, teen-agers from low-income families and South Asian women who suffered from domestic violence .
"Most donors insist on anonymity," said Ms. Fine. "But we can draw a profile: More often than not, the recent donor is a woman with a professional career in her 30's or 40's who received income from a family business, an inheritance, a legal settlement or some unexpected source. We also are seeing older, 'mom' donors coming with their daughters and even grandparents introducing nieces and nephews to giving."
A similar increase in donations from women in the Boston area is expanding giving at the Haymarket People's fund, which operates much like North Star. Haymarket, like North Star, runs workshops for potential donors, and has seen participation by women increase from 582 to 709 in the last three years while male participation remains around 200, said Hillary Smith, director of development.
"We see women taking a leadership role today and altering the face of traditional philanthropy," she said. "Older white men historically dominated philanthropy, focusing their interest on buildings bearing their names, on getting seats at the symphony and maintaining the status quo. That's all changing as more women get control over money."
There are those prepared to provide guidance to young women and men who say that the money they have received, but not earned, clashes with their social values, their commitment to a more equitable distribution of wealth and power. One such guide is Christopher Mogil, who was working and living modestly as a community organizer in West Philadelphia when he learned he had a $275,000 inheritance. His reaction: shock and embarrassment.
Inquiring how others coped with such situations, he and his wife, Anne Slepian, uncovered a network of wealthy people committed to social change, including several at Haymarket. They related their experiences in a recent book "We Gave Away a Fortune" published by New Society Publishers in cooperation with the Funding Exchange. Mr. Mogil, who received a second inheritance, has given away $250,000, about a third of his inheritance, setting up the "Chutzpah Fund," to do it.
Some, like Edorah Frazer, a teacher in New Hampshire, gave away most of their inherited fortune, cheerfully violating what Mr. Mogil calls "The 11th Commandment: 'Thou Shall Not Invade Thy Principle."
The day she signed over most of her $450,000 inheritance in stocks and bonds to the Funding Exchange, Ms. Frazer said, "everything fell into place."
 
'Part of That Imbalance'
 "I would encourage people who care what their money represents to look deep inside," she said, adding, "I had to travel by myself, observe people, and pay attention to the earth. I noticed my unhappiness with the imbalanced state of the world, and drew my conclusions -- that I am part of that imbalance, but I can choose to shift the balance a little bit by my own actions."
Grace Ross, a founder of the Women's Alliance, which helps low-income women in the Boston area, inherited $650,000 and then invited a group of community advocates to help her decide what to do with it.
"Whatever is decided, we will come away with good feelings because it's an experience of the human spirit struggling for betterment of the world."
The average charitable giving by Americans is 1 or 2 percent of their income, according to the Independent Sector, a Washington-based coalition of foundations, corporations and nonprofit organizations. Five years ago the coalition began campaigning to increase giving to 5 percent -- without marked effect so far.
While foundations and corporations gave $14 million to charity last year in this county, the bulk of all giving comes from individual Americans. Their contributions added up to $111 billion, mostly to support mainstream institutions in religion, education and the arts. It is this pot of money that is being affected, in small but significant ways, by the decisions of people like Ms. Winslow and Ms. Holloway.
Ms. Winslow describes herself as a "classic kid of the 60's" who was active in the antiwar and civil rights movements and now, in the 90's, campaigns for women's reproductive rights and advocates opening academic ranks to more women from minority groups. The money that she gives to charity comes from family wealth. "My father was a hosiery manfacturer and he wanted to help my grandmother who hated wearing bulky, ugly support stockings and so developed Supp-Hose," she said.
The major concerns of Ms. Hollway, who estimates she gives away at least 10 percent of her nonsalaried income, are the homeless and adequate child care.
"Until you get a system that works, you can yell and scream about family values all you want but to no avail," she said. "You need parents who have the energy and time to spend with children and not be pressured on all sides by work commitments and they do not need some politicians telling them how to live their lives."
Anne H. Hess, another longtime contributor to North Star, said she hopes her children will continue the family tradition of giving. She recalled how her grandmother, Edith Stern, a daughter of Julius Rosenwald, the philanthropist, had prepared each of her grandchildren to play an active role in support of liberal causes.
"My 13-year-old daughter is noticing people have different life styles and opportunities," she said. "Some take taxis and others don't. Their clothes are different. She's asking relevant questions. I'm looking for appropriate answers for her."

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFERS RUSSIA AID IN BUYING FOOD

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
The Bush Administration offered Russia $1.15 billion in loan guarantees and food aid today to help it buy American grain and livestock feed over the next six months.
Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan said 30,000 export-related jobs and $3 billion in economic activity would be created by the credits and assistance, raising immediate suggestions in Congress and among agricultural organizations that the decision was primarily motivated by politics. 
 Two weeks ago, President Bush announced in the Midwest that he was authorizing export subsidies for up to 30 million metric tons, or 1.1 billion bushels, of wheat.
But one agricultural expert said today that if the Administration had wanted to make a stronger impression on many farmers, officials would have found a way to increase exports of meat or processed dairy products, which have a higher value. Food processing also creates more jobs.
 
Who Will Benefit Most?
 Russia has been offered up to 30,000 tons of pork at subsidized prices, but has yet to buy any.
The package announced today consisted of $900 million in loan guarantees and $250 million in food aid or other assistance.
Mike Dunn, vice president for government affairs at the National Farmers Union, said it might have also come too late to help farmers on small holdings.
Mr. Dunn, whose union's political branch has endorsed Gov. Bill Clinton for President, said in an interview that because most of the grains sought by Russia had already been harvested, middlemen and not farmers would profit most.
"Announcing it this long after the harvest means a real boom for the export companies, grain handlers and processors, with only a little dribble down to farmers and ranchers," he said. "If this wasn't politically motivated, it could have been more timely and helpful to family farmers."
In Congress, there is some concern about the ability of the Russians to repay about $4.4 billion in credits outstanding now. Credits have a way of turning into outright aid, a Congressional agricultural expert said.
 
Secretary Cites Russia's Need
 According to the Agriculture Department, Russia will have access immediately to $100 million in credits, which it will use to buy $66 million in feed grains, $24 million in soybean-based protein meal and $10 million in wheat. Russia also has $18 million in previous credit guarantees to buy wheat this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
The remaining credits will be released in two installments: $500 million on Oct. 1 and $300 million on Jan. 1.
"These measures will assure that United States agricultural exports to one of our largest markets continue at a normal pace," Secretary Madigan said. "Although Russian agricultural production is higher and reforms are well under way, we know there is need for this kind of assistance."

Partisan Doctors In Campaign '92

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
THIS year's Presidential election could well be a watershed event for doctors. Many physicians think it could determine the future of the nation's troubled health-care system, perhaps radically changing their profession. And so, abandoning their usual stance on the sidelines in Presidential races, many doctors are volunteering to assist in the Bush-Quayle or Clinton-Gore campaigns.
The doctors' concerns reflect national sentiments: recent public surveys have found health-care to be second only to the economy as the most important issue. 
 President Bush's proposals include a system of health insurance networks, which he said would reduce costs for small businesses. Under this proposal, insurers could not refuse to cover an employer or place limits on people with pre-existing medical conditions.
Governor Clinton's plan includes national spending limits for hospitals and doctors, uniform community health insurance rates for small businesses, guaranteed basic coverage for everyone, and limits on prescription drug prices.
Doctors have long been seen as conservatives, but campaign officials say the health debate is mobilizing people on both sides. "The medical profession is aware that this will be an election of change and that there are two very clear choices in reforming the health-care system," said Dr. Peter B. Collis, an emergency-medicine specialist in Washington who heads the Health-Care Coalition for Bush-Quayle. "A lot of people have picked a position and are becoming politically active."
The American Medical Association does not endorse Presidential candidates, although its political action committee, Ampac, distributes about $4 million in election years to an array of House and Senate candidates. But this year the association has called for a Presidential candidates' debate on health care, and it is encouraging members to work in the campaigns, referring them either to the Republican Dr. Collis or, on the Democratic side, Dr. Stephen Gleason, a Des Moines osteopathic family practitioner. Both are A.M.A. members.
Although it did not endorse a candidate, one of the largest medical specialty groups and a voting member of the A.M.A., the American College of Physicians, called yesterday for a national limit on health-care spending similar to a Clinton proposal.
Dr. Gleason said he had contacted about 4,000 doctors who were joining Clinton campaign committees, raising money, giving speeches and supporting Congressional and local candidates.
Dr. Collis predicts that most of the nation's 500,000 physicians will support President Bush for re-election. Public opinion experts noted that most surveys include too few physicians to justify separate reporting on their views.
But Dr. Collis cited a write-in straw poll in The Medical Tribune, a biweekly newspaper based in New York, which has a national circulation of 130,000. Bill Ingram, the paper's editor in chief, said that 450 doctors participated after The Tribune published the candidates' health proposals, up sharply from fewer than 300 in 1984 and 1988. This year they favored Bush, 44 percent, over Clinton, 20 percent, with 4.7 percent for Andre Marrou, a Libertarian candidate, and 15 percent for "none of the above." Many said that they would still vote for H. Ross Perot, who was favored by 24 percent before he left the race.
"Physicians have received some kind of wake-up call," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a New York pediatrician who is chairman of the National Health Leadership Council for Clinton/Gore '92. The council's 100 members include medical, public health and nursing deans and professors, hospital executives, state officials, health policy experts and private practitioners.
"We found ourselves surrounded in an ocean of paperwork, bureaucracy and intrusion into how health care is practiced, and in a system that has gone very much out of control," Dr. Redlener said. "Doctors have always objected to any kind of government regulation or paperwork."
A Bush supporter, Dr. Beverly Carpenter, a Cincinnati internist specializing in rheumatology, agreed that "the paperwork and hassle is getting ridiculous."
"I don't want the Government to own me," she added. She contends that the Clinton proposals would "take away some of the patient's choices" and give the Government too much control over health care. "I am the artist here, creating what is best, and having to deal with a national bureaucratic system," she said. "Medicine is too specialized to have the Government interfering."
Spurring interest among doctors, The New England Journal of Medicine published summaries last week of the Bush and Clinton health-care proposals. The Bush summary was signed by Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, while the Clinton plan was signed by the Governor. Commenting in the journal, two health-policy experts, Alain C. Enthoven of Stanford University and Uwe E. Reinhardt of Princeton University said that both proposals left many issues vague -- notably, how to pay for coverage for 37 million Americans without health insurance.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Reaction Soft to German Rate Cut

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Germany's interest rate cuts yesterday should have been good news for the American bond market, but investors and traders did not act like it was.
While prices on the domestic market rose, the gains were not as big as those in Europe and Tokyo after the surprise announcement Sunday that Germany would cut its rates. 
 Moreover, the difference between the yield on the 2-year Treasury note and the 30-year bond rose to a record high, indicating in part that worries about the Presidential election may be growing and that concerns about inflation, despite positive news lately, have not been put to rest.
 
Increase in 30-Year Bond
 The 30-year bond was up 13/32 , to 99 30/32 for a yield of 7.25 percent, down from 7.29 percent Friday. But in trading in Tokyo, the bond was up to 100 16/32 , a rise of a full point. The gain in New York did not wipe out the loss on Friday. While shorter maturities faired better in New York yesterday, they gave up some of their gains during the day.
"I am a little disappointed," said Nicholas S. Sargen, the chief investment officer for Prudential's Global Fixed Income Advisers in Newark. "It was good news."
But the cut does not mean that German rates will tumble in a hurry. Mr. Sargen said he would not expect another German cut before the end of this year.
Neal M. Soss, the chief economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York, added: "The bond market does not yet appreciate how bullish this is; that you are in an environment where central banks all over the world can't tighten interest rates and are embarked on a path of easing." .
One of the reasons for the middling performance yesterday was that investors, traders and speculators often have unreasonable expectations. On Friday, no one would have predicted that the German Bundesbank would cut interest rates yesterday. The expectation was that this might happen by the end of the year at the earliest.
When it did come, the market seemed to be dissappointed that the cut was not bigger. The Bundesbank knocked half a percentage point off its short-term rate that is equivalent to the Federal Reserve's Federal funds rate on loans between banks.
There are also some worries -- like the Presidential election and the Federal budget deficit -- that are beginning to cloud the prospects for much lower interest rates in the months ahead. This raises the question of whether the rally is over, especially now that yields on bills are at their lowest in 29 years and other maturities, like the two-year notes, are at their lowest ever.
"I am not a bear on the market," said Terrence Crowe, a vice president at Nikko Securities Inc. in New York. "But the movement down in rates does not have to be a straight line. And we may now go through a period of six months where there is more growth than people are counting on."
Any dose of good news on economic growth could stop the rally for now, especially given the uncertainity of the election and the prospect of some deficit-increasing Government plan to stimulate the economy regardless of who wins in November.
 
Clear Signs of Concern
 One clear sign of concern was the widening yesterday of the differential in the yield between 2-year Treasury notes and the 30-year bond.
This closely watched difference in yields increased yesterday to 349 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, the widest ever.
"Beyond the near term, investors don't believe that inflation can remain low under normal circumstances," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, explaining why long rates have not come down more. "This is a leap they have not made yet."
Analysts also said the widening of the spread reflects in part the buying of shorter-term maturities because investors and speculators are betting that the Federal Reserve may now be able to cut short-term interest rates another notch. With the German rate cut there will be less downward pressure on the dollar. Fed officials had said that the concern about the falling dollar restrained their recent cut of one-quarter of a percentage point in the Federal funds rates.
Another consequence of the German rate cut may be the expectation that the domestic economy might begin to grow faster than expected. The reasoning is that the interest rate declines in Europe that are likely to follow the German move will help revive the European economy and buying of American products. And that buying would help spur growth in the United States.
Mr. Sargen of Prudential believes that the interest rate cut will have this impact. But he said it is way too early to begin changing the forecasts of slow growth here. "The stimulus from the German rate cut?" he asked. "That is a story for late in 1993."
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three- and six-month bills yesterday:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Climbs in a Reaction To Lower Rates in Germany

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar climbed yesterday against most major currencies after Germany lowered its high interest rates, which had sent the dollar to historic lows in recent weeks.
Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, cut its key Lombard rate to 9.5 percent from 9.75 percent. The move came as Italy said it would devalue the lira by 7 percent. 
 The unexpected German action gave rise to optimism that global investors would stop their move into marks and mark-denominated securities, investments that have been made attractive by the large difference between German and American interest rates. The move into mark-denominated investments had battered the dollar in recent weeks.
Though the dollar strengthened on the German move, it retreated a bit by the end of the trading day in New York. Some traders said the dollar's initial response may have been an overreaction.
"It was a small rate cut," said John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at Algemene Bank Nederland in New York. He said the German move was much more oriented toward easing tensions within the European Monetary System and did not signal a Bundesbank policy change.
In Asian trading, the dollar rose as high as 1.505 marks, up from 1.45 marks late Friday in Europe. The dollar finished in London at 1.486 marks. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.4845 marks, up from 1.4485 Friday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.88 yen, up 0.8 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 124.35 yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 124.3 yen, up from 124.25 late Friday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8918, down from $1.9241 late Friday. In New York, one pound cost $1.8935, cheaper than $1.9225 late Friday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metals Up Sharply; Grain Prices Show Losses

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metals futures prices leaped yesterday on hopes that Germany's interest-rate cut would ignite a global economic recovery and higher inflation. Market analysts were skeptical.
The action by the German central bank also contributed to a decline in grain futures prices. On other commodity markets, oil and livestock futures rose. 
 Gold for October delivery surged $5.90 on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $347.30 an ounce. It was gold's biggest one-day gain since Jan. 9.
Silver for delivery this month rose 9.2 cents on the Commodity Exchange to $3.771 an ounce; October platinum moved up $3.90 to $361.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 
Rally Discounted
 William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York, said the rally in the metals was overdone.
"One token rate cut in Europe is not a convincing reason to believe we're headed for a period of economic prosperity and inflation," he said.
Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber, said gold's rally was minor compared with the more than 70-point jump in the Dow Jones industrial average and rallies on overseas stock markets.
"It's the biggest move we've seen in gold in a long time, he said,"but in the bigger scheme of things, it doesn't necessarily mean we're out of the woods yet."
Energy futures prices rallied on the New York Mercantile Exchange ahead of a meeting of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries beginning Wednesday in Geneva to set an output ceiling for the rest of the year.
Light crude oil for October delivery rose 30 cents to $22.31 a barrel; October heating oil rose 0.73 cent to 63.54 cents a gallon; October unleaded gasoline climbed 1.15 cents to 60.93 cents a gallon and October natural gas rose 3.6 cents to $2.184 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The German rate cut also prompted a rise in the dollar's value against European currencies, which put pressure on grain and soybean futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade. Favorable crop weather in most growing areas also contributed to the modest losses in most crop markets.
A stronger dollar makes American goods more expensive overseas, which could reduce export demand for the nation's grain, said Victor Lespinasse, assistant vice president in the grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds.
Traders ignored news that the Bush Administration will give Russia $900 million in loan guarantees to buy American farm products and $250 million in direct food aid. The assistance had been widely expected in the grain markets.
Wheat for September delivery settled 1/4 cent lower at $3.21 a bushel; September corn slipped 1/4 cent to $2.24 a bushel; September oats ended 3 cents higher at $1.43 1/2 a bushel and September soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $5.54 1/2 a bushel.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Does HBO Tell Showtime? In This Campaign, It Does

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
IMAGINE Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola joining forces to try turning around the decline in cola consumption. Or McDonald's and Burger King teaming to counter health claims against meat. Or Bloomingdale's and Macy's getting together to encourage shoppers to leave specialty stores and return to department stores.
An actual version of those hypothetical examples of marketing's lions lying down with its lambs is being developed by the nation's two rivals in pay cable television, Home Box Office and Showtime Networks Inc. 
 As part of a settlement of a $2.4 billion antitrust suit that Showtime's parent, Viacom Inc., had filed against HBO's parent, Time Warner Inc., the Avis and Hertz of premium cable channels agreed to undertake joint marketing and advertising programs aimed at reversing viewers' waning interest in their services.
Growth in pay television has stalled the last two years, a victim of the sour economy and the popularity of videocassette recorders. Perhaps an even more fundamental problem has been competition from basic cable, the entry-level package of programming that subscribers begin getting when they sign up for service.
As viewers continue to perceive improvements in basic cable -- networks like CNN, Discovery, Lifetime, MTV, TBS and TNT -- pay cable seems to be getting relegated to the status of a luxury.
"People with three pay services are dropping the third or, if you have two, you're dropping the second," Larry Gerbrandt, a senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, a cable television industry consulting company, said in a telephone interview yesterday from Carmel, Calif.
"At a time when neither service is growing," he added, "it makes sense to see if cooperation won't benefit both. It's not like both of them are making so much money they can afford not to cooperate."
Still, the $64,000 question -- as they used to say on the old television show that might one day rerun on cable -- is whether the two archrivals can overcome their traditional antipathy and cohabit peacefully. At this point, as the two sides meet to plan five joint promotions during 1993, they are expressing optimism about working in tandem.
"Everybody's feeling pretty positive about it," said Denny Wilkinson, senior vice president of consumer marketing at HBO in New York.
"Once people got over the shock of coordinating a campaign with Showtime," he added, "we all felt this was a good thing."
In a separate interview, Nora Ryan, senior vice president of marketing at Showtime in New York, said: "The first couple of meetings have been interesting. Who'd ever sat down with a competitor and shared enough information to build a campaign together?"
Though "it felt funny," she added, "actually, there's been a lot of camaraderie."
For the five promotions, each lasting around six weeks, HBO and Showtime will spend the largest sum ever devoted to cable promotion. The amount, which the services declined to disclose, will pay for television and radio commercials, direct-mail brochures, free previews, print advertisements and other pitches.
The promotional periods are a blend of when each service has usually run its separate promotions. They will run from Jan. 4 through Feb. 14, March 15 through April 25, June 28 through Aug. 8, Sept. 6 through Oct. 17 and Nov. 1 through Dec. 12.
Both companies' agencies in New York will cooperate on the promotions. HBO uses BBDO for image advertising and Kobs & Draft Advertising for direct response, while Showtime uses Amil Gargano & Partners for image advertising and Wunderman Worldwide for direct response.
Mr. Gerbrandt of Kagan Associates said one fact that augured well for the joint venture is that HBO and Showtime have been cooperating on operating a basic-cable network, Comedy Central, which was formed by a merger of their competing comedy-programming services.
In addition to the joint promotions, each pay-cable service will continue its own separate advertising. Later this month, for instance, Kobs & Draft will introduce a campaign for Multiplex, HBO's multichannel service that was created to broaden programming variety -- thereby attacking the nagging problem that no matter when a viewer tunes into pay television, one of the "Porky's" movies seems to be on.
The settlement of the antitrust suit, reached on Aug. 20, ended legal wrangling that began when Showtime sued HBO in May 1989, accusing its larger rival of predatory practices like putting pressure on the operators of local cable systems to favor HBO's services over Showtime's. HBO had always denied Showtime's charges; both companies said the settlement, which also included a "material" cash payment to Showtime by HBO, estimated at $75 million, was not an admission of wrongdoing.
HBO has around 17.3 million customers, plus 6.3 million for its sibling service, Cinemax; Showtime has about 7.3 million customers, plus 2.6 million for its sibling service, the Movie Channel.

HEADLINE: New Storm Brews On Whether Crime Has Roots in Genes

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
THE cancellation of an academic conference on genetics and crime this month has cast into the spotlight a long-simmering scientific debate on the roots of crime and how it can best be prevented.
The conference, "Genetic Factors in Crime: Findings, Uses and Implications," was to have been held beginning Oct. 9 at the University of Maryland. The National Institutes of Health withdrew funds, saying the conference too readily accepted the notion that violence and crime had genetic causes. 
 But interviews with many of the experts invited to the conference and with others doing research on the roots of crime suggest that had the conference been held, it would have focused on the ethical issues raised by research seeking to link genetics and crime, not on promoting such studies.
And the scientific consensus among these experts seems to be that any inherited personality traits related to crime make a mild and indirect contribution, at best, to the broad mix of life circumstances that lead to a criminal career.
"No one would have claimed there are anything like crime genes," said David Wasserman, a lawyer at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, who organized the conference. "Our purpose was to look at the implications of the genetic research."
Indeed, the first session was to have reviewed a criminological fad of the 1970's, the notion that an extra Y chromosome led some men to be highly aggressive and prone to violent crimes. Later research showed that there was no relationship between having the XYY pattern and criminality.
The objections to the conference were led by Dr. Peter Breggin, a Washington psychiatrist who charged that the meeting was part of a "violence initiative," a Federal research agenda that he said included finding a genetic marker that would identify children at high risk of becoming criminals, and plans to deter them through medications.
But the conference prospectus notes that should genetic markers one day be found for tendencies, like impulsivity, that are loosely linked to crime, they would probably "have little specificity, sensitivity or explanatory power: most people with the markers will not be criminals" and "most criminals will not have the markers."
Dr. Breggin said his accusations were based on remarks made by Dr. Frederick Goodwin, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, at a meeting of the National Mental Health Advisory Council on Feb. 11. Controversy over a statement by Dr. Goodwin at that meeting, which seemed to compare inner cities to jungles, led to his resignation as head of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration.
At the meeting, Dr. Goodwin spoke of planning for a "violence initiative," which, among other goals, would seek to find biological correlates of violence in males, detecting them early in life, and seeking to prevent their expression. He also asserted that adoption studies had shown that genetic factors in violence and aggression were "very strong." Dr. Goodwin declined to be interviewed.
But Dr. Susan Solomon, chief of the Violence and Traumatic Stress Research Branch of the mental health institute, said, "None of our research on violence deals with genetics, and I don't know of any research program in a Federal agency that fits" Dr. Breggin's description, which she said seem to have distorted Dr. Goodwin's remarks.
Dr. Solomon is head of the agency's "violence consortium" which coordinates research on the topic. She said that genetic research "showed that if biology played a role, it was minor in crime and nonexistent in violence, and it is such a poor predictor of crime that it is useless for intervention."
The issue of Federal violence research will be examined on Sept. 25 by a panel led by Representative John Conyers, Democrat of Michigan, at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus, whose members have been critical of the genetic research.
The bulk of the genetic studies have been done in Scandinavian countries, where there are meticulous records of adoptions, twins and crimes. However, because social and economic inequalities are far more pronounced in this country, these factors are likely to be much stronger influences than genetics on criminality in America, several experts said.
"It's questionable whether genes would have much effect on crime among people who live in an American city," said Dr. Gregory Carey, a behavior geneticist at the University of Colorado who has just finished a review of studies that have tried to link heredity to crime. His review will be published as part of a report by the National Academy of Sciences in November.
"There's no DNA segment that codes for crime," said Dr. Carey, one of the researchers invited to the University of Maryland meeting. "There's a multitude of social, personality, cognitive and other variables that intercede between the level of DNA and a complex behavior like crime. My view is that the idea there could be a genetic marker for crime is wild-eyed speculation or science fiction."
Still, biological research on crime has its proponents. "It's difficult to find any form of behavior without some biological basis," said Dr. James Q. Wilson, a professor of management and public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. "It's a very promising line of research."
 
Complexity of Criminal Behavior
 "What's farfetched is the notion that investigating this is going to lead to some test to spot proto-criminals in the third grade," Dr. Wilson said. "Criminality is far too complex a behavior to try to predict. But once you find a biological basis for a behavior, you can try to find out how to help people cope. Suppose the link is impulsivity, an inability to defer gratification. It might be you could design education programs to teach criminals to readjust their time horizon."
The most commonly cited study supporting the links between genetics and crime was published in the journal Science in 1983 by Dr. Sarnoff Mednick, a psychologist at the University of Southern California. In that study, Dr. Mednick compared criminal convictions of 14,427 men adopted in Denmark between 1927 and 1947 with the criminal records of their biological parents.
Dr. Mednick found there was a genetic effect for property crimes like stealing. Biological fathers of adopted men who had several convictions for theft were also likely to have had many such convictions.
But he found no direct inherited tendency for violence from parent to child. "If there were any genetic effect for violent crimes, we would have picked it up," said Dr. Mednick, who was also to have attended the canceled meeting.
Instead, he found that rather than having a violent parent, those men who committed violent crimes tended to have a mother who was mentally ill and a father who committed property crimes.
The findings puzzle Dr. Mednick. "I don't know what's being inherited when it comes to violence," he said. "It may be a lack of responsiveness in the autonomic nervous system, which impairs moral learning in the adopted children. But I wouldn't try to suppress such a trait, even if we could find a marker for it. Doing so sounds repressive to me. You might also suppress other more positive qualities, like creativity."
Geneticists see more sense in seeking a genetic basis for biological conditions, like diseases, than for social phenomena like crime.
Dr. Jonathan Beckwith, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, said, "There's a spectrum from clear-cut biological diseases, where genetics is a sound avenue of research, to very complex behavior like criminality, where the social components are clearly so strong and genetic research is not fruitful." Dr. Beckwith is a member of the Human Genome Project's Group on Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications, which was helping finance the canceled conference.
Many criminologists shy away from biological explanations of crime, in part because criminal careers seem largely the outcome of a long chain of psychological and social events, and in part because there is a long history in the field of debunked claims like those for the XYY chromosome.
One of the first such theories was put forth just before the turn of the century by Cesare Lombroso, an Italian anthropologist who asserted that facial features, like eyebrows that grow together, were signs of a criminal character. In the 1920's and 1930's, the eugenics movement in America claimed that immigrant groups like the Irish, Italians, Jews, and Southern Europeans had higher crime rates because they came from genetically flawed stock. And in the 1950's, a psychologist, W. H. Sheldon, proposed that "mesomorphs," with a heavy-boned, muscular body type, were predisposed to crime.
 
New Zealand Study
 "Every 30 years or so biological explanations of crime come back into fashion, but then fade," said Dr. Terrie Moffitt, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin, who was also to have attended the meeting.
In a study of 500 boys in New Zealand who were followed from infancy to age 18, Dr. Moffitt said she had found that "only 4 percent or so of boys are antisocial at all ages," though if infractions like drinking were included, almost all boys broke the law at one time or another.
Dr. Moffitt added: "While it's plausible that there's a biological basis to the lawbreaking of the most delinquent boys, they also come from the most troubled homes and worst neighborhoods. You really can't say if it's a genetic or social cause."
That problem, said Dr. Moffitt, clouds the interpretation of findings reported this year by Dr. Allen Beck, a demographer at the Justice Department, that more than half of imprisoned juveniles and a third of adult inmates have immediate family members who have also been imprisoned. There is no way to tell, from these findings alone, whether it is genetics or family environment -- or both to differing degrees -- that pass along a tendency to crime.
The biological and social views can have vastly different implications for how to prevent crime. If a criminal nature is genetically predetermined, society might seek to identify those who carry the problem genes and intervene early -- perhaps by the methods to which Dr. Breggin objects -- in order to nip a budding criminal career. But if criminals are shaped by adverse life circumstance, then preventive measures are to be found in improving those conditions.
The bulk of studies on the roots of crime have examined social factors. For example, "harsh and erratic discipline is three to four times more common in the family history of children who become delinquents than those who do not," said Dr. Felton Earls, a psychiatric epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health. "And being from certain neighborhoods rather than others puts kids at a six to eight times greater risk for becoming criminals."
Another key factor, said Dr. Earls, is a child's verbal I.Q. "Criminals, on average, have a verbal I.Q. at school age about eight points lower than the norm."
The typical route to a criminal career for a child born in an American inner city, said Dr. Earls, begins with prenatal factors like a mother "who drinks alcohol and takes drugs like crack, which have a damaging effect on the central nervous system of the fetus, leading to later cognitive deficits."
Another common hazard of early life in inner city neighborhoods is exposure to high levels of lead from peeling paint and auto fumes. "Lead exposure seems to lower I.Q. and impair concentration, and make children hyperactive, exactly the pattern we think predicts crime in adolescence," said Dr. Earls.
When such children arrive at first grade, "they are unprepared to learn," said Dr. Earls. "They are more aggressive than other kids, have conduct problems, and low reading achievement, a pattern that solidifies by third grade, at which point these kids get marked as problems and put in special education classes. As early as third grade, they are stigmatized, and at a social disadvantage."
It is during the years from 14 to 18 that most crimes are committed. By late adolescence, among teen-agers who manage to get jobs, finish their education or get married, there is a sharp dropoff in the numbers of young men who commit crimes. Those who fail to find such a rudder in life are far more likely to continue their criminal careers into adulthood, Dr. Earls said.
Researchers like Dr. Earls are seeking to find the points at which some extra help might shift youngsters away from a path toward a life in crime. "We need to find out where in this process we can intervene most effectively," Dr. Earls said.


GRAPHIC: Historically, various theories have posited a biological or hereditary basis for crime or criminality.
Chart: "Discerning "Nature" in Crime"
 "Darwinism." Sir Francis Galton, Charles Darwin's cousin, studied how humans inherit physical and behavioral traits and coined the name eugenics.
 1857. Degeneracy. "Traite des Degenerescences" contended that criminality, alcoholism, insanity and feeblemindedness werfe manifestations of a single entity: hereditary degeneration. Originating in one generation through drink, poor working conditions or moral violations, it could be inherited.
 1876. Physiognomy. Cesare Lombroso published "L'Uomo Delinquente," stating that criminals were the products of heredity and could be recognized by features like small restless eyes (thieves) or bright eyes and cracked voices (sex criminals).
 1874. The Jukes study. Richard L. Dugdale produced a very influential study of an Irish family he called Jukes in which he traced what he called hereditary crime. He unearthed 709 members, of whome 18 kept brothels, 128 had been prostitutes, more than 200 had been on relief, and 76 were convicted criminals.
 1905-1930. Eugenics. Eugenicists who believed that much crime is hereditary successfully campaigned in many states for the sterilization of criminals. Although eugenics attracted many prominent people, including scientists, most eugenics research was later rejected as careless and inaccurate.
 1970's. XYY. A later discredited study associated crime and violence with this chromosomal configuration.

PRESIDENT BUSH
 In a speech in Colville, Wash., yesterday.
"Technology is key not just to our economic future, but our environmental future as well. . . . Command and control regulation locks this old technology in place. You need incentives -- you need investment -- to make new breakthroughs possible. These programs all reject the old command-and-control mentality that drove up the costs, reduced jobs and never achieved the environmental progress that we desired. 
 Under Governor Clinton, Arkansas ranks 50th -- worst in the country -- for utility and state environmental initiatives, according to an independent analysis by the Institute for Southern Studies. But in his zeal to capture his party's nomination, Governor Clinton has made every promise to every environmental group that sent him a survey. And he and his running mate are advancing a philosophy that goes back to where command-and-control regulation is the only solution -- a philosophy that not only cuts jobs, but could impede technology, environmental progress, not promote it. And when it comes to the environment, I believe extremism on either side is no virtue. Cooperation, innovation, a faith in technology -- these are the virtues that will allow us to protect both jobs and nature."
 
VICE PRESIDENT DAN QUAYLE
 In a speech to workers at at the J. R. Simplot Company, a potato processing concern in Caldwell, Idaho, yesterday.
"This free trade agreement is good for the U.S., it is good for Idaho, it is good for you. And the reason it is good for you is because we will create more jobs and more opportunity. According to our statistics, 170,000 new jobs will be created. We should welcome a stronger Mexico. A stronger Mexico will give us more export opportunity. By having more export opportunity we will have more jobs here in Idaho and more jobs in America. And that's why this free trade agreement is a good agreement. We're now in the post-cold-war era and it's a big question of which way the United States and which way the world's going to go. Are we going to go back to the days of protectionism, where we create barriers or are we going to go the way of the future where we knock down barriers, knock down tariffs and if in fact we become protectionist you know what's going to happen. There's going to be a whole lot of people put out of work because protectionism, it may sound good, in the short term it may be something that you would want, but in the long term it is bad for America."
 
SENATOR AL GORE
 In a speech to workers at Bell Textron in Fort Worth yesterday.
"Bill Clinton and I support a strong national defense and we're not going to make any unwise cut. But, of course as I said before, whoever is victorious in this election in November you're going to see reduction in defense spending. I think everyone understands that with the collapse of Communism and the end of the Soviet Union, that's just in the works. The difference is that Bill Clinton and I have a defense conversion program and we have a sense of what is useful to the United State of America in terms of infrastructure to take the men and women who have helped to win the cold war and instead of leaving them out in the cold, use their talents and energies and expertise and experience to build up this country."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Movement on Debates Reflects Shifting Needs

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUBBOCK, Tex., Sept. 14

 BODY:
The sudden proposal by the Bush campaign to open direct negotiations with Gov. Bill Clinton's staff on the subject of Presidential debates means more than just a realization by Republicans that their strategy of holding out was hurting them politically.
It is, perhaps, also an indication that they sense their campaign is listing, and that a dramatic event is needed to right the ship. 
 But the letters sent by the Bush campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, to the Commission on Presidential Debates and Mickey Kantor, chairman of the Clinton campaign, also mean that after weeks of curious silence by all parties involved, the debate about debates will move toward center stage this week.
That movement seems impelled by two factors: President Bush's inability to get within hailing distance of the Arkansas Governor in the polls and the awakening of the Democrats from their slumber on the debate issue.
When the President decided on Sept. 3 to reject the debate format set up by a bipartisan commission, he knew he was running a political risk. Such last-minute wrangling was supposed to have been ended in 1988 by the establishment of the commission, which is jointly headed by Frank J. Fahrenkopf, the former Republican Party chairman, and Paul G. Kirk Jr., the former Democratic Party chairman.
The commission interviewed former candidates, academics and news media critics and developed a proposal, immediately accepted by the Democrats, for three Presidential debates and one Vice-Presidential debate. Seeking a more freewheeling discussion, the commission recommended that all four debates be led by a single moderator, rather than a panel of reporters who, in the past, seemed more interested in trying to come up with the most unusual question than in pressing a candidate for clarification.
Assuming that all parties return to the commission's timetable, the first of the three Presidential debates is scheduled for East Lansing, Mich., a scant eight days from now.
Mr. Bush's decision to reject the commission's format was covered with the fingerprints of James A. Baker 3d, his new White House chief of staff, and reflected tactical considerations. Four years ago, as he negotiated the debate format with the managers of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis's campaign, Mr. Baker told them he believed that as debates approach, the campaign becomes "frozen." Voters who are undecided, or only leaning one way or the other, become trapped in amber, waiting to see what the debates will show.
With his candidate trailing in the polls, Mr. Baker probably felt he could ill-afford such a freeze at this stage. Putting the debates on hold gives the Bush forces time to close the gap before the a pre-debate freeze sets in.
Meanwhile, Mr. Bush's activities have been intended to close that gap: ladling out Federal pork at every opportunity, approving the sale of military hardware to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia while talking about the job-creating benefits of such sales, raising the issue of Mr. Clinton draft record and releasing a new economic plan.
But even with these moves, Mr. Bush seems unable to make major headway. Even here in his adopted home state of Texas, polls conducted by the Democratic Party and The Dallas Morning News show the race to be a tossup. Given his standing in the polls, Mr. Bush may feel he needs a defining event -- like the serious wounding of Mr. Clinton in a nationally televised debate.
But while the President has been taking his time on the debates, he has not been pushed very hard by the Clinton campaign.
Indeed, until last weekend, when they announced they were sending advance teams to East Lansing to prepare for the scheduled debate, the Democrats seemed content to maintain a front-runner's stance.
"Every minute spent talking about debates is a minute taken away from the issues," George Stephanopoulos, the Clinton campaign's communication's director, said last week. "We've not going to make this the center of our campaign."
For the Democrats the question of the debates is not as straightforward as first appears. "I think the Clinton people are of two minds on the issue of the debates," said Susan Estrich, who managed Mr. Dukakis's campaign four years ago. "They have an opportunity to show that they can hold their own, that they are not a risk and they are a safe vote for change. On the other hand, they're ahead, and debates are always risky. If Clinton were behind, he would be pushing like hell for debates."
But even as the Democrats nudge the process forward, they will feel no need to push too hard for debates. The polls and the Bush campaign may do the pushing for them.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush, in Far West, Sides With Loggers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLVILLE, Wash., Sept. 14

 BODY:
President Bush rushed today to side with Far West loggers in a war with environmentalists over a threatened owl, vowing to block renewal of the Endangered Species Act unless it takes into account jobs and the economy while protecting vanishing creatures.
The President's position, long implicit but not formally announced until now, would force a basic change in the 19-year-old law, one of the strongest environmental measures ever enacted. 
 "The Endangered Species Act was intended as a shield for species against the effects of major construction projects like highways and dams, not a sword aimed at the jobs, families and communities of entire regions like the Northwest," Mr. Bush said. "It's time to put people ahead of owls."
The law now requires the Government to take steps to protect threatened wildlife, regardless of the economic effects on towns or regions where the wildlife live.
 
Effort to Change Law
 Mr. Bush's statement marked a significant step in what has become an election-year transition from advocate of strict environmental laws to a candidate who sees economic benefits in relaxing environmental restrictions.
In the first two years of his Presidency, Mr. Bush pushed through a Clean Air Act that strengthened controls on virtually every source of air pollution in the country, barred construction of a new dam in Colorado, halted oil exploration off both coasts and ordered a Government-owned electric utility to reduce pollution that clouded the Grand Canyon.
And his Administration added plants and animals to the endangered species list at an annual rate faster than any President since Richard M. Nixon.
But since last summer, when Mr. Bush approved a proposal that would open half the nation's wetlands to development, the President has favored an approach to environmental policy aimed at protecting jobs. In January, he halted new environmental regulations that he said would be too costly, and he speeded up those the White House considered friendly to business. He removed restrictions on logging in the national forests, approved efforts by the Justice Department to relax enforcement of strip-mining laws and negotiated out of an international treaty's restrictions on American production of carbon dioxide.
 
Decades of Bitter Debate
 The Endangered Species Act has been a point of contention between conservative and liberal political interests for decades, precisely because it is so unbending. In the past, Federal courts have halted billion-dollar dams to save tiny snail-darters in the waters below them, and have limited subdivisions to save desert kangaroo rats.
Here in Washington, where timber companies are struggling in court with environmentalists over the fate of a threatened bird, the northern spotted owl, Mr. Bush assailed the act as a "broken" law that he pledged "will not stand." He offered no details of his favored replacement, except to say that it should give "greater consideration to jobs, families and communities." But his sentiment was clear.
The challenge to put people ahead of owls drew cheers from nearly 5,000 people crammed into a chilly local lumberyard here, although residents said none of the forests in this part of the state are home to the owls.
Colville, near Spokane, is a Republican stronghold in nominally Democratic Washington. The dispute over the owls is centered mostly in far western Washington and Oregon, where the logging industry is badly depressed and Mr. Bush is far less popular.
It also was not clear what Mr. Bush's threat to block renewal of the endangered species law actually means in practical terms. Congress has not sought to re-authorize the act this year, in part, Republicans charge, because it would force Democratic lawmakers to take a stand on the spotted owl.
The White House is seeking instead to place language that would reinterpret the act in the $7 billion Interior Department appropriations bill, which is now in a House-Senate conference.
A spokesman for the department, Steve Goldstein, said Mr. Bush's challenge was technically aimed at a future re-authorization of the act, but he refused to rule out a Presidential veto of the Interior bill if his language was rejected.
The Endangered Species Act, signed by President Nixon and enacted in 1973, prohibits the Government, with very rare execeptions, from considering economic factors in identifying animals and plants that are threatened with extinction. The law allows the President to name a Cabinet-level committee, popularly known as the God Squad, which can approve plans to save a species even if the palns take into account economic considerations like the number of jobs affected. But that has only been done twice: this year and in 1979. The first time, the committee approved a dam in Wyoming near a habitat of the endangered whooping crane. Last May, the panel voted to allow logging in Oregon on 1,700 acres that are a home of the spotted owl.
Environmentalists swiftly assailed Mr. Bush's remarks today.
"A cost-benefit analysis would gut the Endangered Species Act," said Eric Glitzenstein, a Washington environmental lawyer who has been an adversary of the Interior Department. "It would substitute an economic judgment for a scientific and biological judgment on the status of species."
 
Popular Stand Here
 But Mr. Bush's comments were cheered by hundreds of members of the Alliance for Freedom, a national group that hopes to roll back environmental restrictions.
"This is extremely encouraging to those of us who have been a besieged community the last four years," said Larry Mason, executive director of the Washington Commercial Forest Action Committee, in Forks, Wash. "Finally, there is a discussion on the Presidential level of the appropriateness of a law like the Endangered Species Act."
In his remarks today, Mr. Bush sought to depict his position on the act as a moderate one, saying Congress had always contemplated a balance between environment and economy.
"Not far from here is a timber town called Forks," Mr. Bush said. "Like Colville, Forks supported a mill, and the mill supported a community. Because of a lack of timber, the mill had to close. Today unemployment at Forks is at 20 percent. The car dealership has closed. The clothing store is gone."
Mr. Bush maintained there was a single reason for the economic devastation: "The balance has been lost" between economics and environmental needs.
"Today," he asserted, "when harvesting on Federal timberland is stopped outright by 13 different lawsuits under 7 different statutes, each inconsistent with the others, the balance has been lost. It's time to fight for jobs, families and communities."
Flying by helicopter into this town of 5,500 people deep in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, Mr. Bush also opened his Federal grab-bag again, as he has repeatedly in recent weeks, to strengthen local industry.
He said he would not sign a new species law unless he is given a specific plan "to harvest enough timber to keep timber families working in 1993 and beyond." He also promised to mandate that all logs cut from Federal lands in Washington be processed at local mills, rather than exported uncut to foreign ports. On Thursday, the President moved to keep idle timber mills open by waiving Federal rules that slow the cutting of dead and dying timber in the West, where drought and disease are rampant in forests.
The exporting of uncut logs, productivity improvements in lumbering and a shift of the industry to the South have contributed to a large loss of jobs in the Western timber business.
Washington and Oregon are at the center of the debate over saving the spotted owl, a subspecies now reduced by logging to about 3,000 nesting pairs in Washington, Oregon and California. The owl lives mostly in the dwindling stands of old-growth forests that are among the last areas untouched by timber firms.

HEADLINE: Kauai Adjusts to Frontier Life Style After Hurricane

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIHUE, Hawaii, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Across the hard-hit island of Kauai today, people were traveling by car and by foot to search for a bag of rice, to wash their dishes or to learn news of the aftermath of the hurricane that has devastated their lives.
As relief supplies flooded the main city of this small tropical island, residents began adjusting to a frontier life style that officials said could last well into the future. 
 Already one of the least-developed fringes of the 50th state, this quiet tropical island of 55,000 people was stripped of many of its modern amenities by Hurricane Iniki on Friday.
In the isolated town of Kalaheo, residents converted school cafeterias into family kitchens or set up charcoal grills to prepare hamburgers and rice.
In the small community of Eleele, two tourists pitched in to help distribute relief supplies and dig a latrine.
 
Long Lines at Gas Stations
 But without electricity, rebuilding was confined to hammering and sawing, as power tools remained useless.
At the few gasoline stations that had recovered power for their pumps, long lines formed, patrolled by the police.
"We are communicating like the Romans did, with runners," said Mayor JoAnn Yukimura of Kauai. "That's what is really hindering the relief effort."
Mayor Yukimura said it could take months for full telephone, electric and water service to be restored. Still worse, she said, it could take years to revive the economy.
"To build, you have to have a foundation to build from," she said. "The foundation is gone. But hopefully we can find some opportunities to build from and I'm sure the future of tourism is very bright despite the trouble we've had."
 
Relief Supplies Rushed In
 The agricultural base of the economy was destroyed with the leveling of fields of sugar cane and orchards of macadamia nuts and fruit trees. Although consumers on the mainland will be able to obtain substitutes from other growers, the farmers here will not be able to quickly replace the lost income. The growing tourism industry on Kauai was also dealt a severe blow as luxury hotels were damaged and tourists were sent scurrying to board evacuation flights.
The National Guard continued to ferry in relief supplies, and the Army and Navy joined the relief effort, bringing supplies and heavy equipment to help rebuild the island. The naval assault ship Belleau Wood also arrived with its complement of helicopters to bring ashore goods, including portable kitchens and showers.
But around the island, life proceeded at a more basic level.
Among residents who traveled to the Mayor's office to try to learn the latest news was Mary Monroe-Pereza, who lives in the small town of Kalaheo on the southwest coast.
"It's word of mouth; it's the coconut wireless," she said, describing the island's regression to primitive means of communication.
Another visitor, Bruce Torres, stopped by the Mayor's office with his dishes in the back of his van after driving to a gasoline station to wash them.
"You can live without lights but you can't live without water," said Mr. Torres, who is a district manager of The Garden Island newspaper. "You can't flush the toilet or do anything."
The island's economy, which has still not fully recovered from a smaller hurricane, Iwa, 10 years ago, could take years to revive.
Iniki, which enveloped the island for three hours on Friday with winds of up to 160 miles an hour, devastated sugar cane fields. Some sugar cane workers said the destruction could be a death knell for their failing industry.
The winds swept 30-foot waves across beaches, filling the lower floors of luxury hotels with sand and debris, frightening and angering thousands of tourists.
"I've got a whole suitcase full of sexy lingerie I never got to use," said one woman who is on her honeymoon here from Iselin, N.J. She said her husband, a volunteer firefighter back home, had gotten so caught up in joining the relief efforts that she had hardly seen him.
The signs of devastation were everywhere across this lush island. Fruit trees that took years to grow were stripped of their fruit, their leaves and even their branches.
In every community, homes, small businesses, fast-food outlets, shopping malls, gasoline stations and small factories had lost roofs, windows, walls.
In a subdivision near Lihue, sheet-metal rooftops ripped from buildings now lay in twisted sections in a forest across the highway, littering the ground like giant candy wrappers.
Along with the current privations and long-term economic difficulties, the island's residents must now live with the trauma of their memories.
Surrounded by symbols of security and normality in the Mayor's office, Mrs. Monroe-Pereza found herself reliving the fears of the hurricane.
Embracing her 6-year-old daughter, Sarah, she described herself huddled in a basement with her children as the wind howled and banged above them.
As she spoke, Mrs. Monroe-Pereza burst into tears and exclaimed, "God, everybody's lucky not so many people were killed."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Bush Looks Forward, Not Back

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT


GRAPHIC: This 60-second commercial for President George Bush is the second he has put on the air since the Republican National Convention. The ad campaign is costin an estimated $2.5 million and was introduced on network television over the weekend.
 
ON THE SCREEN
Chart: "Bush Looks Forward, Not Back"
President Bush giving his speech at the Republican convention interspersed with shots of fighter planes, factories and a young family.
 
SCRIPT
"The world is in transition. The defining challenge of the 90's is to win the economic competition. To win the peace, we must be a military superpower, an economic superpower and an export superpower. In this election, you'll hear two ways of how to do this. Theirs is to look inward. Ours is to look forward, prepare our people to compete, to save and invest so we can win.
"Here's what I'm fighting for: open markets for American products, lower Government spending, tax relief, opportunities for small business, legal and health reform, job training and new schools built on competition, ready for the 21st century."
 
SCORECARD
The 60-second ad represents a further effort by the Bush campaign to focus the Presidential race on the future, rather than on the last four years. The ad is stresses the message that the President does indeed have an economic agenda for his second term, on that differs from Gov. Bill Clinton's on important points. The ad is vague on precisely what these differences are, but suggests that while the President favors such popular steps as tax relief and health care reform, Mr. Clinton does not.

Major Races to Watch: Today's Primaries in New York and Connecticut

 BODY:
New York and Connecticut hold primary elections today, with races for the United States Senate, House of Representatives, State Legislature and other offices. To cast a ballot in a party primary, a voter must be registered and enrolled in that party. Here are the highlights of some major races.
 
THE SENATE
 
NEW YORK
 In New York, four Democrats are seeking the nomination to challenge Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican Senator.
 
The Candidates
 ROBERT ABRAMS, 54. Lawyer, State Attorney General since 1979. Elected Bronx Borough President, 1969. First won office as Assemblyman from the Bronx, 1965. His compaign had raised about $4.2 million as of late last month.
 GERALDINE A. FERRARO, 57. Lawyer, former New York City public elementary school teacher and Assistant District Attorney in Queens. Elected to Congress from Queens, 1978. Chosen Democratic Vice-Presidental nominee in 1984. Had raised about $4.3 million.
 ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN, 51. Lawyer, New York City Comptroller since 1989. As Congresswoman, served on House Judiciary Committee during impeachment hearings of President Richard M. Nixon. Won Democratic nomination for Senate in 1980, but lost election to Alfonse M. D'Amato. Elected Brooklyn District Attorney, 1981. Has raised about $1.8 million.
 AL SHARPTON, 37. Child preacher, ordained at age 10 by a Pentecostal minister in Brooklyn. Active in various civil rights causes for two decades. Making first run for elected office. Had raised about $60,000.
 
The Issues
 The Candidates have few major policy differences. Mr. Abrams and Ms. Holtzman support cuts in defense spending three times as deep as those advocated by Ms. Ferraro, and more sweeping changes in health insurance. She alone supports the death penalty. In the last month, the race has boiled down to a bitter referendum over Ms. Ferraro's family finances, and she and her rivals have accused each other of lies and distortions.
 
Analysis
 There are no publicly available statewide polls to provide a reliable picture of the race, but most analysis and the campaigns themselves foresee a close contest between Mr. Abrams and Ms. Ferraro. The outcome depends heavily on turnout, which is forecast to be less than one-quarter of the state's 3.8 million registered Democrats. Returns from upstate, where one-third of registered Democrats live, may prove pivotal.
 
Connecticut
 
The Candidates
 CHRIS BURNHAM, 35. Two-term state representative from Stamford who is on leave from his job as a public finance specialist with First Boston. His campaign has spent about $430,000.
 BROOK JOHNSON, 45. Millionaire textile executive and political greenhorn from Greenwich. His campaign has spent about $900,000, much of it Mr. Johnson's own money.
 
The Issues
 Mr. Burnham and Mr. Johnson hold similar positions on the major issues. Both favor the creation of private enterprise zones, tax breaks for investors to create jobs and stimulate the economy, and spending curbs to reduce the Federal deficit. Both support a woman's right to choose an abortion.
 
Analysis
 Mr. Burnham is campaigning as a "grassroots" candidate whose greatest strength is his willingness to knock on doors and even walk across part of the state to reach voters. He won the endorsement of the state Republican Party at its convention in July. Polls show that few people are aware of his candidacy, and he is running 40 or more percentage points behind Mr. Dodd.
 Polls show that despite his spending twice as much as Mr. Burnham, Mr. Johnson is doing just about as poorly against the incumbent as his rival.
 
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 
5TH DISTRICT: QUEENS, NASSAU
 
The Candidates
 GARY L. ACKERMAN, 49. Former publisher of The Queens Tribune. He served in the State Assembly from 1979 to 1983 and has represented the 7th Congressional District in central Queens since 1983.
 RITA MORRIS, 68. Professor of Library Science at Nassau County Community College. Although she has been involved in local community and school groups in Westbury, L.I., she has no prior political experience.
 
The Issues
 The cost of health care is important in the district and both candidates support a comprehensive national health insurance program that would be financed largely through employer payroll taxes. Mr. Ackerman fovors Federal aid to retool defense firms like Grumman, many of whose residents live in the district. Mrs. Morris has called for speeding up public works projects to create jobs.
 
Analysis
 Mr. Ackerman, who has apologized to constituents for writing 111 bad checks in the House bank scandal, is endorsed by Democratic committees in three counties. They have lent volunteers and other support to his campaign, which has increased Mr. Ackerman's already strong voter recognition, particularly in Queens, Ms. Morris is considered a long shot, but this is the year of the woman and often of dissatisfaction with incumbents.
 
6TH DISTRICT: QUEENS
 
The Candidates
 FLOYD H. FLAKE, 47. Has represented the southeast Queens district for six years. He previously gained a local reputation as the socially active pastor of the 6,000-member Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens.
 SIMEON GOLAR, 63. Lawyer, former chairman of the city's Human Rights Commission and City Housing Authority and a Family Court judge. He has run uncuccessfully for the House four times.
 
The District
 The 6th District, which emerged relatively intact from the recent Congressional redistricting, includes predominantly black middle-class areas like Cambria Heights and Springfield Gardens, predominantly white middle-class sections like Bellerose and pockets of poverty and deterioration in South Jamiaca and the Rockaways.
 
The Issues
 Mr. Golar, backed by the Queens Democratic organization, says Mr. Flake has been a "part-time congressman" who spends too much time on his church activities and not enough on his congressional duties. Mr. Flake dismisses the charges, saying the "real issue" is that he is working to help the community gain "grass roots" power and that this threatens local party loyalists, for whom Mr. Golar is fronting.
 
Analysis
 Mr. Flake started as the far-better-known incumbent, with a small army of committed political workers from his church, so the outcome will depend on how successful Mr. Golar and his own cadre of party workers are in making Mr. Golar known to the voters and in persuading them that Mr. Flake has shortcomings that shortchange them.
 
10TH DISTRICT: BROOKLYN
 
The Candidates
 EDOLPHUS TOWNS, 58. Teacher, hospital administrator and college professor in New York before becoming deputy borough president of Brooklyn in 1976. Elected to Congress in 1982.
 SUSAN ALTER, 50. A founder of the Flatbush Development Corporation. Has been a member of the City Council since 1978.
 FRANK SEDDIO, 45. Lawyer and former police officer. Former district manager of Community Planning Board 18 and former assistant commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation.
 
The District
 The new 10th District, which sits like a canopy over the northern part of Brooklyn, was redrawn this year to maximize black voter strength. Still, it pulls in widely diverse areas, including predominantly white middle-income sections like Carroll Gardens and Brooklyn Heights; predominantly minority areas like Bedford-Stuyvesant and East New York; Williamsburg, where Hasidic and Hispanic residents co-exist uneasily, and white, blue-collar Cararsie.
 
The Issues
 Mr. Towns, who is backed by the Brooklyn Democratic organization, says Ms. Alter, his principal opponent and a white woman, does not understand "the unity of the black community." He also argues that she does not have the seniority or connections to be effective in Congress. Ms. Alter criticizes Mr. Towns for "poor constituent service," for his involvement in the House Bank scandal and for taking money from the tabacco industry. Mr. Towns rejects those charges, saying he had "overdrafts" but no bounced checks. And he says he accepts less tobacco money than other New York congressmen.
 
Analysis
 After facing only token opposition in the voting booth since his election to Congress in 1982, Mr. Towns is contending against strong anti-incumbency sentiments, redistricting and an unexpectedly strong showing by Ms. Alter. Mr. Towns has captured almost every major political endorsement but must hold on to the support of the largely minority sections of the new district to win. Ms. Alter, who entered the race late, has made inroads into the mostly black neighborhoods. Mr. Seddio is expected to get support mainly in Canarsie, where he is from.
 
12TH DISTRICT: QUEENS, BROOKLYN, MANHATTAN
 
The Candidates
 ELIZABETH COLON, 40. Former executive director of the Association of Puerto Rican Executive Directors, a public policy and advocacy organization. She lives on the Lower East Side.
 RUBEN FRANCO, 45. Former president of the Puerto Rican Legel Defense and Education Fund, a civil right group. He lives in the South Bronx.
 ERIC RUANO MELANDEZ, 42. Assistant professor of psychology at Bronx Community College and is a member of the New Alliance Party. He lives in the South Bronx.
 STEPHEN J. SOLARZ, 51. United States representative from the 13th District in Brooklyn since 1975. Serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Lives in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn.
 NYDIA M. VELAZUEZ, 39. Former secretary of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the United States. Lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
 
The District
 Hispanic residents represent 58 percent of the district's total population. Of the registered Democrats, Hispanics represent 49 percent, non-Hispanic whites are 29 percent, blacks are 16 percent and Asian Americans are 5 percent.
 
The Issues
 In a race where the leading candidates are not widely separated by ideology, the central issue is whether a non-Hispanic, Mr. Solarz, can capably represent a district that is predominantly Hispanic. Mr. Solarz says that he can, and that he has the experience to deliver services more effectively. His rivals say he will be out of touch with his Spanish-speaking constituents.
 
Analysis
 With a $2 million warchest that has enabled him to inundate the Spanish and English-language media with advertisements. Mr. Solarz is considered the frontrunner. But he has been wounded by the House bank scandal, and if one Hispanic candidate -- most likely Ms. Velazquez or Ms. Colon -- can grab a preponderance of Hispanic votes, the race could become extremely close.
 
17TH DISTRICT: BRONX, WESTCHESTER
 
The Candidates
 ELIOT L. ENGEL, 45. Former teacher and State Assemblyman who grew up in Co-Op City. Seeking his third term in the House, where he serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee
 MARIO BAIGGI, 74. Was Bronx Democratic Congressman for 20 years. Mr. Biaggi's most recent term was cut short in 1989, when he received an eight-year prison sentence for among other things, bribery and extortion. A judge freed him last year to receive treatment for what were called life-threatening heart and neurological problems.
 
The District
 The redrawn 17th District cuts through the northern Bronx and darts into parts of southern Westchester County. Its population is now nearly two-thirds black and Hispanic. Some of Mr. Biaggi's former strong holds, like the white ethnic neighborhoods of Morris Park and Thogs Neck, were excised. The district includes includes Co-Op City; the Irish working-class enclaves of Woodlawn and Norwood, and south Mount Vernon and its middle-class black homeowners.
 
The Issues
 While neighborhoods vary, voters have many of the same concerns -- affordable health care and housing, more jobs, lower taxes and above all, safer streets. And for many, Mr. Biaggi himself is an issue. He has based his comeback bid, in part, on his political record, a reputation for championing the working people through unflagging constituent service and legislation over 10 terms in Congress. Mr. Engel has tried to shift the focus to Mr. Biaggi's conviction on charges stemming from the Wedtech bribery scandal.
 
Analysis
 Mr. Biaggi, a police officer for 23 years prior to his political career, has been endorsed by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and other police groups. But he faces formidable obstacles, including Mr. Engel's contention that Mr. Biaggi "disgraced" his former office. Democratic leaders have not welcomed Mr. Biaggi back. Though less colorful than his opponent, Mr. Engel is better-organized and better-financed.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Dances With Wolves

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
To understand Israel it is useful to understand this: It was created by and for a special breed of people -- Jewish gamblers.
Who else but a gambler would take the odds of going off to live in rock and desert, surrounded and outnumbered by neighbors trying to kill him, on the chance that someday the rock would spout water, the desert flower, the neighbors embrace him, and both peace and pride be granted to him and his children? 
 And who but a member of the subspecies Jewish gambler would sing in praise of God for being allowed to throw the dice with life on the table?
Now Israelis are taking the biggest gambles since they first accepted the odds that a democratic Jewish-based island could exist at all in an ocean of Muslim dictatorships.
One is the decision of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to move so rapidly toward the full self-rule for Palestinians he once opposed. Another and greater gamble is to make clear now that he will also give up West Bank territory to Palestinians. With negotiations still early on, that makes much more likely the creation of the Palestinian state he once said was unacceptable.
Mr. Rabin is also gambling that Israel can be lastingly safe if he returns to Syria control over part of the Golan Heights -- from which Syrian soldiers once fired at will down into Israeli kitchens.
Self-government for Palestinians was a concept that the Likud Government of Menachem Begin created and the Likud Government of Yitzhak Shamir accepted. But they did not accept turning over territory to the Palestinians, fearing that a Palestinian state would be a center for anti-Israeli irredentism, and certainly not to Syria.
In 1978 Mr. Rabin, then a member of the Labor opposition, said in the Knesset that the Begin plan for full autonomy "forebodes catastrophe" for Israel and raised the "gravest danger" of a Palestinian state. Independence was then and is now the official, overriding Palestinian goal.
Now Mr. Rabin believes that after the death of the Soviet Union, the Arabs' chief arms supplier, and the gulf war, the Arabs may be ready for peace and that Israel must seize the moment. In fair elections, Israelis have put their trust in him -- from his mouth to God's ear.
Foreign friends of Israel should criticize economic, political and social failings in Israel. But determination of life-and-death security policies belongs to Israelis -- as it does to the people of every free society.
That is one reason I and so many other foreign friends of Israel opposed the Bush-Baker pressure on Mr. Shamir's own security decisions -- and the attempts by some American opponents and Israeli Laborites traveling abroad to destroy him, even to the point of befriending Yasir Arafat.
The Rabin policy is not only Israel's choice but a strong gamble for peace. Big stakes, big risks. But Mr. Rabin makes a mistake by not pointing out the risks Israel is taking.
This gives the world the impression that it is up to Israelis to make the concessions, that pressure on the Arabs is irrelevant, that the current lessening of danger to Israel will last indefinitely.
I know he believes that in 5 to 10 years a Syria armed with Chinese missiles, a revived Iraq, Iranian nuclear capacity and fundamentalist growth could confront Israel with vivid, renewed danger. He wishes to use the present to defang the future, an act of courage.
But, leading his country toward opportunity and risk, he emphasizes the former, and says little about the latter. Natural politics, maybe, but it adds another risk -- that Israel will be pushed to more concessions, more risk. Why not, if Israel believes the dangers so diminished that its leader hardly talks about them?
Mr. Rabin tells Jews to talk more about friends than enemies. That is condescending to anybody, but to Israeli Holocaust survivors, insulting. And he apparently wants American Jews to forgo their full rights to lobby Congress.
Nothing doing. Congress helps shape foreign policy. No American should waive his rights to speak his mind to his legislative representatives, ever. Ever.
Israel's friends should wish this Israeli patriot well, and pray for his success. But while they are praying they might look up and remind the world that Israel still dances with wolves.

HEADLINE: Observer;
Two in Pangloss Mode

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
When Ross Perot quit he freed President Bush and Governor NotBush to avoid the subject, and they have since been avoiding it with zest. The subject, of course, is: "What's it going to take to haul the economy out of the pit?"
Mr. Perot decided the answer was, "Sacrifice." The word gives off noble vibration, but everybody knows that, after we enjoy the pleasure of being called to sacrifice, pain cometh swiftly to all but the canny and the well connected. That's why seasoned politicians handle sacrifice gingerly. 
 Thus after President Kennedy's splendid summons -- "Ask not what your country can do for you . . ." -- people who asked what they could do for their country discovered that accepting the benefits of substantial tax reductions would be sufficient.
As a businessman, Mr. Perot was probably aware of the advertising campaign for aspirin featuring the cry, "I haven't got time for the pain!" In any event, he concluded that the national demand for pain was too small to justify a $100 million campaign to sell it.
Well, talk about media furioso! (Or is it media furiosa?) He was roundly abused and accused of wimpishness and poltroonery. The assault was led by media people, who tend to be youngish, self-righteous, high-salaried and, to judge by their effusions against Mr. Perot, masochistic.
Their case against Mr. Perot was the patriot's against the shirker: a nation in desperate straits needed him and he had let it down. All right, but what now has become of this hunger for a candidate who trumpets the call to sacrifice in these critical times, if you will forgive the bromidic prose so essential, alas, to political journalism?
President Bush and Governor NotBush are getting away with the same wimpish poltroonery that incensed media parsons in the Perot affair. I scarcely dare mention their free pass on the pain issue for fear colleagues will say, "So what?" or, "They all do it," or some other media-talk equivalent of "Grow up."
Messrs. Bush and NotBush both concede the existence of economic distress, but neither suggests that getting out of it may require a bit of pain for you, me and the whole darn family. If the economic plight is so desperate that Mr. Perot failed a patriotic duty by abandoning his campaign, surely Messrs. Bush and NotBush are equally derelict since they act as if the plight is not plight enough to call for remedies stronger than aspirin.
("We know you haven't got time for the pain, folks, so just take two of these photo ops every day and don't worry until this silly election is out of the way.")
True, Governor NotBush has warned the over-$200,000 crowd that he will put them to the tax rack to dispel the multitrillion-dollar deficit. And President Bush says he will stop pork-barrel spending if Congress will just be reasonable, surrender its historic "power of the purse" and give him veto power over every item in the Federal budget.
If the economy's plight is as dire as the Perot diagnosis suggested, the Bush-NotBush proposals amount to applying a mustard plaster to a ruptured appendix. I keep having this fantasy of President Roosevelt on the radio for one of his "fireside chats," and he is telling us not to worry about sacrificing to meet the stupendous cost of raising mighty armies, because the Wehrmacht can readily be defeated by the Boy Scouts of America.
The charm of the present campaign's approach to economics, of course, is obvious: "Look, folks! No pain!" Except for the plutocratic minority, of course, who not only deserve to suffer for being plutocratic, but are also heavily lawyered, hence abler than most of us to confound the tax cops.
If President Bush and Governor NotBush are to get a free pass on the economic issue, they should at least be badgered to address a few aspects of our end-of-century predicament that are safer for politicians to discuss. There is, for instance, the vital question of the national morale and the agents destroying it.
I refer to implacable health forces that keep 250 million people in a constant listless state of terror and depression. Iron, for example. Causes heart attacks. That was last week's bulletin. Wake up, Bush! Get with it, NotBush! Psychic depression can kill too.

Light Trucks Pace Rise in Vehicle Sales

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks rose 10.1 percent in early September, though car sales remained stuck at a fairly low level.
"The best that can be said is that a painfully slow recovery continues," said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association. 
 Total vehicle sales in the first 10 days of the month totaled 231,559. Light-truck sales, which include sales of mini-vans, sport-utility vehicles and pickups, rose 17.9 percent, to 102,332, but car sales grew only 4.5 percent, to 129,237.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales for the period was 6 million, compared with 5.9 million in late August, and 5.4 million during the corresponding period last year.
Wendy Needham, automotive analyst for Smith Barney in New York, called sales "lackluster," attributing much of the weakness to the decision of the General Motors Corporation to sell fewer cars to rental fleets.
The Ford Motor Company turned in the best performance, with car sales increasing 14.5 percent, to 35,924, and light-truck sales up 20.8 percent, to 34,653 during the period.
Dick Phelps, general sales manager of Beach Ford Inc. in Virginia Beach, Va., said "we're having the best month in our 30-year history." Mr. Phelps said sales are up one-third for the year.
G.M.'s light-truck sales gained 12.4 percent, to 40,209 for the period. But G.M.'s car lines, partly because of less aggressive fleet sales, dropped 4.6 percent, to 57,968. Every G.M. car line but Pontiac and Saturn reported a decrease.
The Chrysler Corporation posts sales on a monthly basis only. Its sales were estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports, which put the company's car sales in the period at 11,550, down 1.9 percent, and truck sales at 20,950, up 11.1 percent.
Ms. Needham of Smith Barney said: "It's still too early to judge the '93 models by these early results. Many haven't been introduced yet."
The Honda Motor Company's car sales dropped 11.3 percent, to 10,377. Honda and other Japanese auto makers have taken hefty price increases in recent years, giving some consumers the impression that models built by the Big Three are a better value than in previous years.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales more than doubled to 7,811 over last year, propelled by the new Toyota Camry model built in Georgetown, Ky. Toyota's light-truck sales reached 2,296; there were no comparative figures since Toyota only started building light trucks in the United States within the last year.
The Nissan Motor Company car sales rose 35.7 percent, to 2,150, with the introduction of its domestically produced Altima model; Nissan's light-truck sales in the period fell 4.8 percent, to 2,373.
The Mazda Motor Corporation's car sales rose 74.1 percent, to 1,309; Mazda's light-truck sales rose 94.6 percent, to 447. The Mitsubishi Motor Corporation's car sales rose 32.2 percent, to 1,449.
The Isuzu Motor Corporation's light-truck sales rose 97.1 percent, to 1,394.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Stage a Broad Retreat

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market, many traders are saying, has had too much of a good thing: bad news on the economy and positive news on inflation. And now, after a vibrant rally, slow economic growth and declining inflation is just not enough to keep the climb going.
The economic data on retail sales and inflation released yesterday should have been positive for the bond market. 
 Retail sales fell five-tenths of 1 percent in August, and, despite a revised 1 percent growth in July, the totals for the two months were still sluggish.
On the inflation front, the Consumer Price Index was up three-tenths of 1 percent in August. Prices excluding food and energy are up just 3.5 percent in the last 12 months. In the last three months, these prices are up at an annual rate of just 2.5 percent.
But the bond market paid no heed yesterday. The 30-year bond gave up all of Monday's gains and more, with its price falling 22/32 in secondary trading to yield 7.30 percent, a jump from 7.25 percent Monday.
The price fall, however, was across the board and even with another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Reserve still possible, bill rates jumped.
"We need sensational inflation news and we need seriously weak economic news," said, said Joseph Liro, the chief economist at S. G Warburg & Company in New York. "The market needs bigger and bigger fixes of slow economic data to sustain this."
Jay Goldinger, a bond trader at Capital Insight in Los Angeles, lamented, "How much better can the news get?"
Traders attributed yesterday's plunge tothe market's numbness to economic data and a series of other factors, including an overly optimistic reaction to the German interest rate cut Monday and a heavy supply of corporate bonds in the market.
There were also signs that some investors were considering moving money to Europe, where the promise of a further decline in interest rates means the opportunity for large capital gains.
The market, according to some traders, also got a bit of indigestion from the issue of $2 billion in five-year global bonds by the Canadian province of Ontario. While one of the two lead underwriters, Merrill Lynch, said it was happy with the big deal, some other traders said they were having trouble selling it.
"It has been tough sledding," said one trader involved in the deal. "The pricing was right. But with the benefit of hindsight, the size was too big. It is a buyer's market out there and investors can be selective."
The bonds, with Goldman, Sachs as the other lead underwriter, were priced to yield 48 basis points over the comparable Treasury security. The 5.625 percent five-year Treasury note was priced to yield 5.34 percent in late trading yesterday.
The Ontario deal was the centerpiece of a day where corporate isses totaled about $3.2 billion, as corporations sought to beneift from some of the lowest interest rates in years.
But this large supply of corporate notes and bonds is forcing many dealers who buy them to hedge their exposure by selling Treasury securities and this has accounted for some of the downward pressure in the Government market, traders said.
Among some of the other corporate deals were $300 million in 12-year subordinated debt by Conagra Inc.; $300 million in 10-year notes by the Rockwell Internaitonal Corporation and $250 of 33-year bonds by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
Another factor in the market, traders said, was the selling after some knee-jerk buying, especially in Japan and Europe, after Germany announced its rate cuts on Sunday, but before the actual size of the cut was disclosed Monday.
While the switch in policy by the German central bank was surprising and very significant, the small half- percentage- point cut in rates disappointed many investors.
"Its been overestimated in its import, especially in the United States," said Peter Roge, the senior vice president for economics at Swiss Bank in Basel. "A very large difference does remain between the U.S. dollar interest rates and German mark interest rates. So we will continue to suffer from a weak dollar for some time to come."
 
Foreign Bonds
 Bonds fell sharply in Britain, as some of the euphoria over the German rate cuts subsided. Prices were down about a point on the day as the yield on the current 10-year bond, or gild, jumped to 9.27 percent from 9.07 percent in early trading.
After rallying yesterday, the British pound fell to the bottom of its allowed trading range in the European Monetary System, raising the possibility that the government might have to raise interest rates to defend the pound.
In France, bond prices were also off, but not as much as in Britain. The yield on the 10-year bond due in November 2002 was up to 8.67 percent from 8.64 percent.
In Germany, bonds bounced back from early declines to close little changed on the day.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Generally Higher; Gold, Up Abroad, Off in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher yesterday, particularly against the British pound and Italian lira, in hectic currency trading dominated by economic uncertainties in Europe.
"The market was so nervous it really caused people to scurry around," said Carl Forcheski, a corporate trader on the foreign exchange desk of Chemical Bank in New York. "It was very unpredictable." 
 Gold prices fell marginally in the United States after rising overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell 40 cents a troy ounce to $346.40. The Republic National Bank quoted a late spot price for gold of $346.00 an ounce, down 45 cents from Monday.
The advance by the dollar came a day after it moved sharply higher on news of Germany's cut in interest rates. The high German rates had pushed the dollar to historic lows earlier this month.
 
Initial Euphoria Short-Lived
 Traders said that the initial euphoria of the rate cuts faded in European trading yesterday and that the dollar weakened at first in response. But the mood swung later on speculation that further interest-rate cuts in Germany were possible.
Higher rates make currencies worth more but hurt economic growth, while lower rates make currencies worth less but stimulate economic growth.
The German rate cut was part of a weekend agreement among European Community nations to realign the value of their currencies. The realignment resulted in a 7 percent devaluation of the Italian lira. But traders said that even with the lira devaluation, the Italian currency remained expensive. The British pound also came under intense pressure because of widening expectations that it would be devalued. The resulting selloffs in lire and sterling helped the dollar move higher.
Financial markets in Japan were closed yesterday for a national holiday.
 
Pound Falls in London
 In London, the dollar was quoted at 124.20 yen, down from 124.88 yen at Monday's close in Tokyo. Later in New York, the dollar fetched 124.25 yen, down from 124.30 yen late Monday.
The pound fell in London to $1.8715, from $1.8918 late Monday. Later in New York the pound fetched $1.8635, cheaper than its $1.8935 rate late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, were: 1.4910 marks, up from 1.4845; 1.3195 Swiss francs, up from 1.3145; 5.0640 French francs, up from 5.0310; 1,205.50 lire, up from 1,177.00, and 1.2172 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2132.
Gold rose in London to $346.45 a troy ounce, from $346.25 late Monday. In Zurich, it rose to $346.55 from $346.40 and in Hong Kong, it rose $3.68, to $346.50.
Silver for current delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York,rose 3.5 cents an ounce, to $3.806.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: THE INCUMBENT;
Round Two: D'Amato Takes Aim At Opponent

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
Even before he found out that Robert Abrams would most likely be his Democratic opponent, Republican Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato was spewing venom in Mr. Abrams's direction.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. D'Amato skewered the State Attorney General with several select adjectives: "insipid" and "flaccid, no, no, I mean, placid, placid." 
 In contrast, he flattered former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, his preferred opponent. He predicted she would win and spoke of her "charisma" and "star-like quality."
In fact, Mr. D'Amato, who issued a blistering attack on Ms. Ferraro just a month ago, expressed outrage at the "nauseating pillory" of Ms. Ferraro during the primary campaign and insisted that the other candidates should apologize to her..
"Their race was an absolute, total disgrace -- mean-spirited, downright ugly, a turn-off, a mud bath," said Mr. D'Amato, a 12-year incumbent.
And, elaborating at his Manhattan campaign headquarters Tuesday night, Mr. D'Amato said: "I'm certainly not going to stand by and let anyone dump manure on me."
 
Calm Day in Washington
 While the Democratic candidates for his seat fretted through the final day of their campaign, Mr. D'Amato was in Washington, wondering -- indifferently, he said -- whether his opponent would be "him" or "her."
"It doesn't really make too much difference," he said before flying back to New York in the early evening. "Whoever it is, it is not going to be an easy race."
Nonetheless, Mr. D'Amato directed his first barbs at "him."
"That little, disingenous guy, I don't know what he stands for other than trying to get elected," Mr. D'Amato said. He added: "How's that? And I haven't even started."
Because Larry Rockefeller, an environmental lawyer, failed to get on the Republican ballot, Mr. D'Amato was left with little to do yesterday primary but contemplate ways to spend his $8 million campaign fund.
At 7 A.M., he voted in the Congressional election in Island Park, L.I. (for Peter T. King). Then he flew to Washington for a day of meetings -- "half hour on breast cancer research, very interesting" -- and Senate votes.
He said he had preferred Ms. Ferraro as his opponent because controversy over ethics would be muted by mutual difficulties.
Mr. D'Amato had sweated through a two-year Senate ethics investigation, which cleared him of breaking any rules but scolded him for "improper and inappropriate" conduct in allowing his brother, Armand, to use his office and stationery for lobbying. Ms. Ferraro, while a Representative, was found in violation of the Ethics in Government Act for failing to disclose information about her husband's finances.
Regardless of his opponent, Mr. D'Amato said his campaign would be "a referendum on jobs and economic growth," criticizing President Bush's failure to revive the economy.
It would be "an informative campaign -- hah, hah, hah," he said. "And don't print that 'hah, hah, hah.' "

HEADLINE: Banker Gives Russia Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
A leading German banker said today that the United States and other industrial countries should not reduce the debts and interest that Russia owes Western governments and commercial banks.
The banker, Horst Schulmann, proposed instead that governments should help Russia develop its oil, transport and food industries. 
 Also today, the World Bank said in its annual report that it might provide loans worth $2.5 billion or more during the fiscal year ending June 30 for the republics of the former Soviet Union.
The bank's report for the year ended June 30 showed no lending to Russia or the other republics. In August Russia borrowed $600 million to help improve health, food supply, transport and other production -- the first loan to go to any of the new countries.
 
Figure Could Rise
 "Within two years, it could rise to an annual figure of $4.5 billion to $5 billion," predicted Tim Cullen, chief spokesman of the bank.
Last year the bank lent $1.8 billion to Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania.
Mr. Schulmann, the German banker, spoke at a farewell news conference as head of the Institute of International Finance, an organization of international banks with its headquarters in Washington. He is leaving to head the central bank in the German state of Hesse, with a seat on the board of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank.
He argued that granting debt reduction to a country discouraged commercial banks from lending to that country again and encouraged other countries to fall into arrears on interest payments owed to banks.

HEADLINE: Yields Fall At Banks

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates were down for the week ended today, The Bank Rate Monitor said in its most recent survey.
Yields on deposits in New York area banks were down significantly. The average money market account was off 3 basis points, to 2.92 percent, and three-month certificates were off 5 basis points, to 2.95 percent. The six-month certificates were off 7 basis points, to 3.12 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 In the latest week, yields at commercial banks were down much more sharply than yields at savings banks were. At commerical banks, the yields were down 2 basis points, to 2.75 percent, on money market accounts; down 7 basis points, to 2.80 percent, on three-month certificates of deposit, and 9 basis points on six-month certificates, to 2.93 percent.
In comparison, at savings banks, the yield on money market accounts was off 4 basis points, to 3.09 percent, while the yields on three-month certificates fell by 2 basis points, to 3.11 percent, and by 4 basis points, to 3.31 percent, on six-month certificates.
The largest cuts in yields among New York banks were at the First Federal Savings and Loan in Rochester, which lowered the yield on its money market account by 20 basis points, to 3.05 percent, and at Banco Popular, which lowered its 3-month C.D.'s by 26 basis points, to 2.79 percent. Marine Midland lowered the yield on its six-month C.D.'s by 21 basis points, to 2.58 percent.

HEADLINE: Sales Drop, But Inflation Stays Low

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
American consumers remain extraordinarily reluctant to spend, and that reluctance is helping to hold inflation down to the levels of the 1960's.
Retail sales, which account for about a third of economic activity, fell five-tenths of a percent in August, the biggest drop since March, after rising 1 percent in July. 
 The discouraging report from the Commerce Department, which showed that consumers bought less furniture and fewer cars and big-ticket items of all kinds last month, suggested that the torpid economic expansion is not picking up.
 
Little Cause for Optimism
 "I don't see anything that is going to change this pattern of a very, very slow turnaround," said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the department store company based in Minneapolis. "You'll see a little rise in spending in the fall, but consumers won't be running into the stores."
Or onto car dealers' lots, for that matter. Consumers bought domestically made models at an annual rate of six million the first 10 days of this month, only a bit ahead of the 5.9 million rate in July.
But the reluctance of consumers to spend has had one benefit. It has made it difficult for many businesses to raise prices.
Despite a spurt in fruit and vegetable prices, the Consumer Price Index edged up just three-tenths of a percent in August, following similarly small or smaller increases in each of the last four months. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, inflation is running lately at a 2.4 percent annual rate.
"Over the last few months, inflation news has been a lot better than the bond market had been expecting," said William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "Last month's report shows that the good news was no fluke."
Economists said today's reports did not contain any clear signal to the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates significantly or immediately.
 
Retail Sales
 The sour August sales results were sweetened a bit by the fact that sales were stronger in July and June than was previously believed. Retail sales not only zigzag from month to month but are also frequently revised.
Spending rose twice as much in July, and fell only a third as much in June as originally reported, mostly because the Commerce Department had missed some car sales. In the end, that meant that sales for August were four-tenths of a percent higher than May's sales -- instead of three-tenths of a percent lower.
"The report shows a little more strength in the third quarter than we thought," said David Kelly, senior economist at the Boston Company Economic Advisers, "but only a little bit more."
One reason for the weakening in August was that car sales, about a fifth of retail sales, stalled. Another was that the housing market was still weak, hurting sales of furniture, appliances and building materials.
Consumers did show up at department stores in August -- also about a fifth of retail sales -- but sales did not grow as much as in July.
"In past recoveries, we didn't have to see improvements in income before consumers were willing to step up their spending," said Richard Curtin, director of the Center of Consumer Surveys at the University of Michigan. "They always felt improvement was on the horizon."
For the first time, he said, the Michigan survey is finding that most families do not expect their financial circumstances to be better five years from now and most do not think it makes a difference who will be President next year.
 
Consumer Prices
 Excluding food and energy -- volatile categories which tend to obscure the underlying price trend -- inflation has been heading down this year.
The most promising sign that inflation might continue to cool was that price increases for services, which are largely immune from foreign competition and seemingly impervious to the weak economy, finally appeared to be moderating.
The cost of everything from renting an apartment to going to the movies was climbing at an average annual rate of more than 5 percent in the second half of the 1980's. But since the end of last year, price increases for services have eased from a 4.5 percent annual rate to a 3.9 percent rate. Rents are no longer climbing relentlessly and even medical costs are rising no more than five-tenths of a percent a month.
"Businesses can't make price increases stick," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "That's one of the more unusual aspects of this recovery."

HEADLINE: Vehicle Ban On S.I. Ferry Is Planned

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
New York City has decided to ban vehicles permanently from the Staten Island Ferry to discourage motorists from driving to Manhattan and to allow for a $112 million renovation of the ferry's downtown terminal.
Vehicles have been prohibited since an arson fire last year seriously damaged the roof and ceiling of the terminal, in lower Manhattan. But last month, the city concluded that by building a new terminal without space for vehicles it could reduce roadway congestion, enlarge a nearby pedestrian mall and increase space for ferry passengers. The city would also expand parking at the terminal on Staten Island. 
 "Historically, the city has pandered to motorists, and that has to change," said Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for the City Transportation Department. "For a handful of cars each day, why should we have to limit our design considerations?"
Some Staten Island officials and residents said the move is yet another slight against their borough, the city's least populous. They said that even though only a small number of vehicles used the ferry, residents needed more options for driving off the island. The only routes off the island now are the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to Brooklyn and crossings to New Jersey.
The decision to ban cars permanently was made in late August. City officials said it was not widely publicized because they believed it affected only a small number of people. But Deirdre Pizzicara, a spokeswoman for Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, said her office had been flooded with complaints from people who learned of the decision through The Staten Island Advance. She said Mr. Molinari was lobbying city officials to reconsider the move.
About 1,000 vehicles took the ferry each day before the fire. About 65,000 passengers take the ferry daily. It costs 50 cents round trip for each passenger, and when vehicles were allowed, they were charged $2 each way, in addition to the passenger fare.
The ferry provides spectacular views of New York Harbor as it sails between Manhattan and Staten Island.
Its base in Manhattan, the Whitehall Ferry Terminal, was erected in 1907. On Sept. 8, 1991, a spectacular fire set by homeless people destroyed its ceiling and roof, forcing the city to cobble together a temporary terminal on the lower level of the building.
Before the end of the year, the city expects to reopen part of the upper level of the terminal, which will serve as an interim waiting area, with some concession stands and restrooms, until the new building is completed.
The city's Economic Development Corporation has selected six architectural firms for a competition to design the new terminal, which is expected to take five years to build. Officials have instructed the architects that the plans for the new building should not include space for vehicles, said Catie Marshall, a spokeswoman for the corporation.
Ms. Marshall said the corporation hoped to pick an architect by November, with construction starting in 1995 after two years of design. She said the new building would be far more striking than the current structure, which the American Institute of Architects, New York Chapter, AIA Guide to New York City calls "the world's most banal portal to joy."
"We are looking for something that says waterfront, that says transportation hub, that says New York," Ms. Marshall said.
The new terminal is to provide extensive space for retail stores, restaurants and a pedestrian mall.
Mr. DePlasco said money was not a major factor in the decision to ban vehicles on the ferry. He said the city would reap significant financial benefits from the move only around the turn of the century, when it is scheduled to buy new ferryboats. Those would be less expensive because they would not need extra space for vehicles.
Ms. Pizzicara said her office conducted a survey of 1,600 commuters on the ferry that found that 59 percent of the respondents favored allowing vehicles, though 62 percent said they had never used the service.

ROLE OF WOMEN IN POLITICS
In a year in which so much attention has been paid to the role of women in politics, New York's Senate race, pitching Ms. Ferraro against Elizabeth Holtzman, was always a center of discussion and a source of awkward pride for feminists and voters who said women might be the ones to bring about political change.

HEADLINE: Stocks, Off 48.90, Give Back Much of Gains

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Wall Street's euphoria over Germany's interest rate cuts evaporated yesterday as it had in Europe. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.90 points, or 1.4 percent, to 3,327.32, consuming more than two-thirds of Monday's 70.52-point gain, the year's largest.
The United States bond market also reversed direction yesterday, selling off even after a favorable inflation report and downcast retail sales figures, the sort of news that normally supports bond prices. 
 What economists had said when Germany cut its rates Monday -- that the easing was only modest and unlikely to animate the American or European economies soon -- somehow took a day to reach investors' ears. And the burst of volatility caused analysts to grope for appropriate metaphors and explanations.
"Sometimes when you get in the store, it isn't as good as it looks in the window," said Byron R. Wien, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "Now everybody's worried that the Germans just cut rates for appeasement as opposed to a fundamental change in policy."
European markets also gave up much of Monday's advances, with London and Paris stocks falling 2 percent. German stocks, the obvious beneficiaries of lower German rates, fell only half a percent.
The decline on the American market yesterday confounded some hopes that the Dow would soar out of the range of 3,250 to 3,400, where it has lingered much of the year.
"This is not new territory," said Richard B. Hoey, portfolio manager of the Dreyfus Growth and Income Fund. "But previously, we passed through it in a calmer way."
New York Stock Exchange volume was a moderately heavy 211.9 million shares, down from Monday's 252.8 million shares.
The broader market reversed almost all of its gains, with the Standard & Poor's 500 falling 5.50 points, or 1.29 percent, to 419.77, from the record level reached on Monday.
While cyclical stocks -- the makers of autos and industrial equipment that depend on a brisk recovery -- led the market up on Monday, the defensive consumer goods stocks led it back down. Drug, food and diversified health-care stocks accounted for almost a fifth of the S.& P. 500's decline.
Several investment firms lowered their earnings estimates for International Business Machines, citing weaker demand and price wars. I.B.M. stock fell 2 7/8, to 85 1/2, accounting for more than 6 percent of the Dow's decline.
Amdahl, traded on the American Stock Exchange but the most active issue anywhere, fell 5 1/4 points, to 9 3/4, after it predicted a quarterly loss.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall as Markets Rethink German Role

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
One day after Germany's central bank grudgingly nudged its interest rates down, financial markets across Europe and in the United States fell today as investors concluded that the Bundesbank by itself could not foster economic recovery or ease currency strains.
The widespread declines in stock prices wiped out much of the gains recorded on Monday. Despite the German rate cuts, key currencies like the British pound tumbled in value relative to the German mark, and the Italian central bank was forced to intervene to support the lira just two days after it was devalued by 7 percent. 
 In American stock trading, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped 2.1 percent on Monday, lost 1.4 percent today, ending at 3,327.32, off 48.90. [Page D8.]
While the action on Monday by the Bundesbank was seen across Europe as a step in the right direction, economists said that today's market reaction suggested just how ill equipped and reluctant the institution was to play the part increasingly being thrust upon it: that of central banker and monetary policy maker for the entire European Community.
"This is not a role the Bundesbank wants," said Axel Siedenberg, an economist at Deutsche Bank A.G. in Frankfurt. "The Bundesbank's policy is to be the German central bank, and it is written into the law that its role is price stability in Germany."
With France set to vote on Sunday on whether to proceed with the next phase of European unification, analysts said the markets now were as jittery as they had been before the German move, and that there remained the possibility of further economic jolts, like a rise in British interest rates or a further devaluation of the lira. The Bundesbank has already strongly signaled that it saw no room now for further rate cuts on its part.
"The reaction in the markets has been that the Bundesbank failed to achieve the good of relieving the immediate tensions in the exchange-rate mechanism and it did the harm of undermining its own anti-inflation credibility," said Ian Harnett, an economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities in London.
In agreeing to a very limited rate reduction, economists said, the Bundesbank tried halfheartedly, and apparently failed, to persuade markets that it could be counted on to act in the interests of Europe as a whole without compromising its domestic role of guiding the German economy through the difficulties of unifying East and West Germany.
"The Bundesbank is carrying the burden of dealing with irresponsible fiscal policies and huge transfers to the east at home, and at the same time is expected to carry a growing international responsibility," said Richard Portes, the director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in London. "It's not feasible."
The current instability in European markets reflects a primary problem that has emerged from the halting progress toward economic integration: that the development of an economic policy institution -- namely a European central bank -- has lagged behind the increased interdependence of the nations that have already pledged to keep their currency values stable.
"Fixing exchange rates means having a common monetary policy to back them up," Mr. Portes said, "and in Europe now you don't have a common policy, you have 12."
Plans for European economic integration call for a central bank to be up and running by the latter part of the decade, but those plans would almost certainly have to be shelved if the French reject the Maastricht treaty on unification on Sunday. In that case, Europe would probably have difficulty maintaining its system of fixed exchange rates.
The situation is only the most striking example of how nations around the world have groped for years, largely unsuccessfully, for a way to reconcile domestic economic and political realities with the need for greater international cooperation.
The United States, for example, agreed seven years ago under the Plaza Accord to consider the international effects of the dollar's value in setting its monetary and fiscal policy. But that agreement, and other similar moves, have generally been forgotten in the face of domestic economic difficulties. Right now the world's three main economic powers, Japan, Germany and the United States, are all dealing with flagging domestic economies in very different ways that are to some extent at cross purposes -- Japan through increased public spending, Germany through high interest rates and the United States with low interest rates.
The willingness of the German central bank to take a somewhat more international view by pushing its key rates slightly lower after resisting such steps for months had been hailed by politicians in Europe as evidence that Germany would prove a good partner in a unified Europe. In a sign of the political sensitivity of the Bundesbank's role, Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited the central bank on Friday, The Financial Times reported today.
But some economists said that today's sharp drop in share prices and currency values may have held another lesson: even the Bundesbank is relatively defenseless against the power of the financial markets when the markets sense that there is more rhetoric than action behind commitments to stable currencies and greater international coordination.
Analysts said that for the rest of the week the markets would be fixated on France. A negative vote in the referendum would almost certainly throw currency and stock markets into turmoil.
But Theo Waigel, the German Finance Minister, told reporters today that there was no consideration being given to a further realignment of currencies. "I have more important things to do with my time than to consider the possibility of a French 'no,' " he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: CONNECTICUT;
Brook Johnson Captures Republican Senate Race

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
Brook Johnson, a millionaire business executive from Greenwich who was completely unknown in Connecticut politics until he announced his candidacy last May, scored a decisive victory yesterday in the Republican primary for the United States Senate.
His victory over a better-known opponent -- Chris Burnham, a two-term State Representative from Stamford -- underscored the power of intensive spending, particularly on television commercials. 
 Mr. Johnson, who had never run for office before, spent about $900,000 on the primary, twice as much as his rival. About $500,000 of Mr. Johnson's money went for a series of television and radio commercials depicting him as an experienced manager who would bring "a dose of success Washington needs" to the Senate job.
With all of the state's 834 precincts tallied, Mr. Johnson held a 59-41 percent lead over Mr. Burnham, receiving 59,295 votes to his rival's 40,873. Voter turnout was extremely light across the state, as is often the case in Senate and House primaries.
 
Expensive Race Looms
 Mr. Johnson's nomination could spell a tougher-than-expected re-election battle for Connecticut's senior Senator, Christopher J. Dodd. Mr. Johnson, who has financed most of his campaign costs, has said he expects the general election campaign to cost as much as $3 million more. Mr. Dodd, a two-term Democrat, has a war chest of about $2 million.
The Johnson campaign insisted that their message, and not simply the television medium, was what won the race. "The message is jobs, and getting the economy going again," Mr. Johnson told The Associated Press last night.
Mr. Burnham, who conceded defeat at about 10 P.M., vowed to help Mr. Johnson against the incumbent, whom both Republicans had ridiculed for spending more time on foreign policy than on domestic concerns.
Mr. Dodd told The A.P. he had congratulated both Republicans on the race, adding, "As I told Brook Johnson, I hope I only have to do this once." As for the upcoming general election, he said: "I'm very proud of my record. We'll be more than happy to debate that record."
In Congressional primaries around the state, novices and novel strategies did not fare as well.
In the First District, centered in Hartford, a registered Democrat endorsed by the Republican Party, Robert K. Ludgin, lost by 69 percent to 31 percent to Philip L. Steele in the Republican race to face the five-term incumbent, Barbara B. Kennelly.
In the Second District's Republican primary, State Senator Ed Munster beat Glenn T. Carberry, who has never been elected to public office, by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent. Mr. Munster will face the incumbent, Sam Gejdenson, in November.
In the Sixth District, one Democratic novice, Gene Slason Jr., beat another, Alan DiCara, by 58 percent to 42 percent.
With all of the votes counted in the Democratic primary in the Fifth District, Jim Lawlor, a Waterbury probate judge who was the party's endorsed candidate, held a 52-48 percent lead over Lynn Taborsak, a State Representative. But Mr. Lawlor declined to claim victory, saying he would have to examine the returns, which Ms. Taborsak also contested.
The Senate primary presented voters with a pair of candidates who lined up fairly closely on the major issues, but in sharply different styles.
Mr. Johnson, who had never run for public office, spent about $500,000 on television and radio commercials that portrayed him as an experienced businessman in shirtsleeves, who knew the value of a tax dollar and would keep Congressional spending under control.
Mr. Burnham did not run a single television commercial and relied on a more homespun approach, ringing doorbells, visiting shopping centers and making a 150-mile trek across parts of the state to meet voters.
Until the final days, the campaign remained relatively free of mud-slinging. In a debate televised Sept. 6, Mr. Johnson claimed he had served on a school board in Greenwich, where he lives. In fact, he had served on a committee of his children's private day school. The error prompted Mr. Burnham, in another debate shown a week later, to accuse Mr. Johnson of "lying about your resume in public service," as well as portraying him as a corporate raider who had committed "corporate rape."
Mr. Johnson called the charges "silly" and his opponent "a whiny kid talking about things that he's absolutely wrong about."
Each insisted he was the underdog in the race, although Mr. Burnham's name was far better known to the politically astute in Connecticut. A two-term State Representative from Stamford, he had gained additional notoriety when he was called up as a Marine Corps reservist for duty in the Persian Gulf war.
The most hotly contested Congressional primary came in the Fifth District, a swath of the state's western half that includes well-off suburbs like Wilton and economically depressed towns like Ansonia. There two Democrats, Mr. Lawlor, a Waterbury probate judge, and Ms. Taborsak, a state representative from Danbury, traded personal as well as professional insults throughout the summer. Both saw an opportunity to unseat the incumbent, Gary Franks, a freshman who is the only black Republican in Congress.
Another important primary took place between two Republicans in the Second District, which covers the eastern half of Connecticut, an area long dependent on defense contracts and where the end of the cold war has meant unemployment for thousands of people. Mr. Carberry, a lawyer from New London, had been the choice of the state Republican Party despite losing to the incumbent, Representative Sam Gejdenson, four years ago.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact vs. Environment: A Clash at a House Hearing

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
House Democrats and the Bush Administration clashed today over the environmental impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, with lawmakers asserting that safeguards are inadequate and the Administration acknowledging that the treaty would prevent the United States from directly enforcing tough conservation rules in Mexico.
Under insistent questioning by Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee, William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that if Mexico chose to relax its environmental standards to attract American factories, "we have no direct recourse to apply sanctions to that company's products." 
 Mr. Reilly's statement came in the first of two Congressional hearings this week in which the Bush Administration is expected to defend the proposed treaty against attacks by Democrats who say its environmental provisions are weak and will encourage manufacturers to exploit differences in the two countries' enforcement programs to gain a competitive advantage.
Immediately after the hearing, Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California and a member of the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said that unless the treaty was renegotiated to provide much stronger provisions for resolving environmental disputes, its chances for approval next year by the House are slim.
"Essentially, what the agreement now provides is a chance for Mexico to wink and not enforce its own laws and attract our businesses," Mr. Matsui said in an interview. "Right now, the only way to enforce environmental laws is through negotiations. That isn't enough, and we think that is a major issue that must be renegotiated."
Since June 1990, when the Administration indicated its strong desire to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico, environmental groups have pushed to have their concerns addressed directly in the text of the accord. The White House and the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, resisted the pressure, saying that environmentalism had no proper place in considering new trade pacts.
But in May 1991, the Administration turned to five national environmental groups for support when it looked as though the House might defeat the legislation allowing the Administration to begin negotiating the pact. The National Wildlife Federation and the World Wildlife Fund subsequently helped in drawing up provisions in the accord. And the Administration acceded to demands from Mr. Reilly that the Environmental Protection Agency be allowed to advise American negotiators.
The accord, completed and made public last week, was touted by Mr. Reilly today as the "greatest trade treaty ever negotiated," and the "only one that contemplates specific sensitivity to environmental concerns."
 
A Central Campaign Issue
 President Bush has cited the agreement as a centerpiece of his program to balance economic growth with environmental goals and has said it will benefit the American and Mexican economies. The agreement has generated strong support in Wall Street investment houses and the boardrooms of most industrial corporations.
Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential candidate, has not decided whether to support or oppose the accord. Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who is also an expert on international environmental issues, are coming under increasing pressure from environmental organizations, labor groups, farm organizations and small businesses to reject the agreement. These groups say free trade with Mexico will hurt conservation efforts and penalize workers by undermining United States protections for health, safety, the environment and wages.
"When you open up free trade between countries with unequal standards of living, there is a tendency to reach equilibrium in wages, health protections, and environmental regulations unless there is specific language to prevent this," said John Cavanagh, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, who is helping to organize opposition to the pact. "That means our wages and standards go down or Mexico's go up. What is happening here is that this agreement gives all the rights to corporations without giving them any responsibility."
Labor Secretary Lynn Martin also appeared today to tell the Ways and Means Committee that the agreement would create more American jobs than it destroyed. But she steered clear of providing new figures for how many jobs might be lost.
Ms. Martin caused dismay within the Administration last week when she told the Senate Finance Committee that the program through which her department planned to help workers displaced by the agreement was based on studies showing that up to 150,000 workers could lose their jobs. These studies have also shown that new jobs would exceed the jobs lost.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
At Work, High Above the Fast Track

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman; Michael T. Kaufman is the new About New York columnist.

 BODY:
IVOR HANSON, a 28-year-old admiral's son, Vassar graduate and musician, makes his living by washing windows and so knows a lot about the fear of falling.
He has worked on windows as high as 45 stories above the city's surface and there have been times when frightening thoughts came to mind. Usually they flickered unbidden for no clear reason, though once they imposed themselves understandably enough when a worn ledge crumbled, leaving him supported only by his safety belt. 
 "What you do when something like that happens or when the fear grabs you, is you concentrate as hard as you can on the exact position of your body," he said. "You picture just where your arms and legs are in relation to the rest of the universe. Then you just focus on the job, the window, the sponges, the squeegee, the $6 you are going to get for each window."
When the sill gave way, Mr. Hanson had leaned against his belt and finished the window before coming in to safety. "I had to," he said, citing a window washer's superstition that you never go back out any window twice during a job.
Mr. Hanson said that in the two years he has been hanging out in high places he has always been able to suppress the spasms of dread. It has been harder, he said, to banish anxieties about another kind of coming down in the world. "Loss of status, downward mobility, I'm reminded of it all the time," said the slender young man, who earned $13,500 last year.
There was the day when Shields Windows, the company for which he works, sent him on a job to the Beresford, a luxury building at Central Park West and 81st Street that is one of the city's most prestigious addresses. Its residents include a world-famous woman of opera, one of the world's greatest violinists and one of the three most recognizable network anchors in America. More to the point, Mr. Hanson's parents also live there: Thor Hanson, the retired admiral who now heads the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and Charlotte Hanson, a teacher at the Brearley School.
With time to kill, Mr. Hanson, who lives with his girlfriend in the East Village, decided to visit his parents. But as he started up, lugging pail and sponges, a lobby attendant barred his way, pointing to the service elevator. "I was about to explain things but it felt so silly, I just went where I was told," he said.
Usually it is his customers who raise the question of status. "I'll be working in some beautiful apartment when the owner figures out from something I say that I am one of those white males for whom the world was made," he said. "You can sense them growing curious and a few have actually asked what a nice boy like me was doing in a job like this."
Not an unreasonable question, even if a bit crudely put.
It turns out, as you might have guessed, that Mr. Hanson is washing windows only for the money, such as it is. His heart is in his music and with Manifesto, the four-year-old rock band for which he plays the drums. Though the band is awaiting the release later this year of a compact disk that has already been issued in England, it has not broken through into economic self-sufficiency.
Mr. Hanson makes it clear that he likes the way his parents live, that he is thankful for his privileged youth and, indeed, hopes to have a privileged future. It's just that he wants to achieve it through his music. "I always knew I wanted to be a drummer in a band and I never hung around the career-development office on campus," he said. "When I graduated I said I would give myself until I was 30 to see if I could make a life and a living as a rock musician." For a while he worked at office jobs but he found washing windows gave him more time for writing music and practicing.
By Mr. Hanson's reckoning he still has two years left on his schedule. But what happens then if the dream remains unattained? Will he give it up? Will he extend the deadline? Will he keep washing windows? Will he put on a suit? Will he go to graduate school?
Such unsettling questions occur far more frequently than the fears of falling from a high story and they are harder to chase. Rationalizing his vocational choice, he points out that many of his friends who started on conventional career paths have been laid off and that almost everyone he knows worries about doing worse than their parents. "It's not like there were all these great money-making opportunities out there for an English major with a B.A.," he said.
But mostly he addresses the doubts like a man on a ledge. "You just can't worry too much about things not working out," he said. "If you do, you sabotage your dreams. You know that letting go will make things much worse."

HEADLINE: Big Plans Are Swept Away by Hurricane Andrew

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla.

 BODY:
The financial losses from Hurricane Andrew can be reckoned in two ways: in the brain-numbing aggregate of billions of dollars or in the suddenly changed life circumstances and plans of people like Jose Garcia.
The 27-year-old Mr. Garcia is Homestead's version of a yuppie, ambitious and upwardly mobile. The eldest son of migrant farm workers who settled here, he started out as a manual laborer at 16, but he worked his way up to head grower at a big ornamental-flower nursery while studying botany at night school. He married last May, and he and his wife, Shana, assistant manager of a nearby florist shop, were saving for the future. The plan was first to buy a stake in a business, then purchase a house and start a family. 
 But the storm ripped the roof off their rental house and ruined nearly all their belongings, a loss that Mr. Garcia estimates at more than $10,000, which was not covered by insurance. His savings of nearly $1,000 have been spent paying bills and buying replacement supplies after the hurricane. For now, he is living at his mother's home, where 30 family members have taken shelter.
 
'It's a Big Setback for Us'
 "It's a big setback for us," he said. "Our plans to buy into a business, to buy a house and start a family will now be pushed back by probably a couple of years. We've got to tighten our belts and start again."
The wealth and income lost because of Hurricane Andrew will affect the economy of South Florida and its residents for years in ways that are now beginning to become evident. How damaging the situation will be depends in part on how much Federal aid, insurance money and bank financing go to help the households and businesses hurt by the storm, and how quickly the money arrives.
"But there will be a loss of wealth because of Hurricane Andrew that will simply never be replaced," said John Godfrey, chief economist of Barnett Banks, Florida's largest bank.
The aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989, suggests that the impact may be considerable. Households recovered only 45 percent of their losses by 1991, while businesses did better, recovering 80 percent, a study by the University of South Carolina business school said.
The post-Hugo research found that the people who suffered most were working-class and poorer families, who were struggling even before the hurricane.
"The big effect is to redistribute income," said Douglas Woodward, an economist at the business school. "The rich don't necessarily get richer, but they are well insured and end up as well off as they were before. In the middle class, some people are hurt. But others, especially those in the construction trades, cash in on the rebuilding boom. And the poor, unfortunately, get poorer."
The recent discussion of "losses" from Hurricane Andrew, projected at $15 billion to $20 billion, tends to underestimate the storm's economic effects. That is because these are estimates of the value of physical assets -- buildings, houses, roads and crops -- destroyed by the storm. Such loss estimates do not count the income lost by businesses, which are either closed or limping along after the hurricane, or by households, where jobs have been lost.
 
'This Has Set Me Back'
 For example, Philip Matalon is president of Fancy Flora Inc., a $4.7- million-a-year grower of house plants, north of Homestead. The damage to his plants and buildings he estimates at $6.3 million, with about $1.8 million of that not covered by insurance. He has laid off 100 of his 120 employees. His skeleton crew has already begun rebuilding the flattened plant sheds.
"But it will take me at least 18 months to get back to full employment," Mr. Matalon said. "And financially, this has set me back three years or more."
Working-class men and women, employed in agriculture and services in south Dade County, were hit hard by the hurricane. They are typically not as well insured as the affluent and they often have scant savings.
Fitz-Herbert Harris, a dentist in South Miami Heights, caters to that working-class clientele. He lost the roof of his clinic and suffered $60,000 of storm damage, but that was not his main concern as he applied for a $25,000 state disaster loan, which is interest-free for six months.
"The hurricane will have a tremendous effect on my dental practice," he said. "A lot of my patients will be poorer, so they will only come in for emergency work, when they have toothaches, instead of regular checkups and cleanings."
The storm has also given new meaning to the phrase "family values" -- that is, the value of a two-income household as a hedge against economic adversity. Ursula Vaccaro, for example, runs a three-person marketing company that sells promotional merchandise, like T-shirts and mugs, to corporations. Hurricane Andrew destroyed more than $10,000 of inventory in her warehouse in Kendall, and last week she was seeking an emergency loan.
Ms. Vaccaro, a single mother supporting two children, had less than $100 in savings when the storm hit. "I live from week to week, like most people," she said.
 
'I'm His Support System'
 Ahmed Chehab's two-person company, which sells kitchen equipment and seating to restaurants, was also hit hard by the hurricane. "Here, take my business card," he said. "It's the only thing left." His losses of $80,000 were not insured. Rebuilding will not be easy, but his wife, Patricia, is a high school teacher in Miami. "I'm his support system," she said.
The purpose of Federal disaster relief, like the $7.6 billion President Bush requested from Congress for the victims of Hurricane Andrew, is to soften the financial blow, especially on those with limited resources.
Indeed, there are programs that should help people. Households, renters and homeowners alike are eligible for grants to cover uninsured losses of as much as $11,500. And businesses are eligible for low-interest loans of as much as $500,000 through the Small Business Administration.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which coordinates the Government's disaster-relief efforts, has 15 centers in South Florida where storm victims can apply for grants and loans. It also has a staff of 300 people going door-to-door seeking out victims. "We are making extraordinary efforts to reach them," a F.E.M.A. spokesman in Miami said.
Mr. Woodward of the University of South Carolina said that his study of relief efforts after Hurricane Hugo found that the key to Federal aid programs was in the implementation rather than in public announcements of the amount to be spent. The problems, he added, ranged from eligible victims who, for whatever reasons, did not apply for relief to wrangling over who qualified for aid.
"There seemed to be big cracks in the programs," he said, explaining why households recovered only 45 percent of their losses.

Philadelphia Arts Area Gets Boost

BYLINE: By David J. Wallace

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
AN insurance company's gift of a building to a theater company in Philadelphia has provided a small boost to the city's longstanding efforts to strengthen downtown theater attractions.
The Arden Theater Company has been given an 8,025-square-foot building on Ludlow Street between 9th and 10th Streets by the Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association, an insurance company. The building was once an electric powerhouse that served the former Federal Reserve Bank building at 10th and Chestnut Streets, which the insurance company now occupies. 
 The building is adjacent to the Arden's 150-seat theater, rehearsal studio and offices in a former church community center. It will be used for storage and shops for the Arden and other companies, said Terrence Nolen, an Arden managing director.
Philadelphia has an ambitious long-term plan for an arts area along Broad Street -- the main north-south corridor -- on a milelong stretch running south from City Hall, in the heart of the city.
The stretch has been designated the Avenue of the Arts. It has one theater, the Merriam; the Academy of Music, the 19th-century hall where the Philadelphia Orchestra performs; a group of older buildings that house the Pennsylvania Ballet, and a private arts school, the University of the Arts. The university has plans for a new 240-seat theater, to be called the Arts Bank, within a former bank building at Broad and South Streets.
The main prospective elements of the plan are a new concert hall at the southwest corner of Broad and Spruce Streets, and, on the northeast corner, a new theater for the Wilma Theater Company. Both the orchestra and the theater company are still raising funds for their projects. The nonprofit Central Philadelphia Development Corporation is overseeing the development of the $250 million arts corridor.
While fund raising proceeds, however, private theater companies are finding ways to expand elsewhere in the city, including in the older structures on the narrow, congested streets close to the Broad Street thoroughfare. The Arden is among them.
"We needed storage, set and costume shops and a new rehearsal space," Mr. Nolen said. "We thought about having to rent additional space elsewhere in the city because last year we had to cancel several acting classes because of the space shortage."
The new building may be used to continue shows that are held over from the primary theater, he said, or to showcase other fledgling theater groups that, like the Arden, used rented space.
For the insurer, donating the red brick three-story building meant relocating huge stacks of files. But the effort is well spent, said Frederick Anton, the company's president, who sees the company's role as a catalyst for development in an area largely ignored in the city's development boom.
Vacant buildings and parking lots dot the area between the Independence Hall historic area and the new office towers of the west downtown business corridor.
"Part of it is our interest in furthering the arts, and part of it is an interest in revitalizing these four or five blocks of the neighborhood around our office," Mr. Anton said. "If you've got the resources, this is an investment worth making. But generally, we don't invest in real estate."
The insurance company is among a group of neighboring institutions that include a shopping mall, the Gallery; Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and a large Federal office building. Large undeveloped parcels separate them. Also nearby are the city's principal existing legitimate theaters, the Walnut Street and the Forrest.
"We've been buying properties in this area for 20 years one parcel at a time, looking to develop adjunct uses for such institutions as the hospital," Mr. Anton said.
The Wilma Theater is to have 300 seats beneath a 175-space garage, built to accommodate the construction of a 30-story hotel tower above it. Designed by Alesker Rieff & Dundon Inc. for the developer, Lobro Associates, the building would ease a parking shortage for an adjacent Hilton hotel that Lobro controls and allow for expansion when the demand for accommodations dictates.
The new $10 million building could break ground by next spring, said W. Courtenay Wilson, Wilma's managing director. The company would relocate from a 100-seat theater a half-mile away. But it has not yet reached its fund-raising goal of $6.6 million for its share of the new structure.
"Last year we got two of our largest corporate contributions from the ARCO Chemical Company and the Provident National Bank for $200,000 and up," Mr. Wilson said. "We raised over $1 million in all, but then ran head-on into the recession."
The Avenue of the Arts concept also includes a renovation of the historic Ridgway Library building to house the High School for the Creative and Performing Arts at Broad and Carpenter Streets.

HEADLINE: New Environmental Debate Expected as U.N. Convenes

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 15

 BODY:
A new round of disputes over environmental issues, pitting the United States and Western Europe against developing countries, is expected to be a major theme of the 47th United Nations General Assembly, which opened today.
One of the Assembly's major undertakings this fall is expected to be the creation of an international agency to hear and assess criticism of the way governments treat the environment. 
 Creation of the body, to be known as the Sustainable Development Commission, was one of the recommendations of the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in June. The new commission will be charged with insuring that nations comply with the pledges they gave there that future economic development would not cause irreparable damage to the world's oceans, forests and atmosphere.
 
The Power of Shame
 The commission will have no legal power to compel governments to change their environmental policies. Instead, it will rely on the force of publicity and shame to encourage them to live up to their Rio undertakings.
Northern industrial countries hope to model the new body on the 53-country United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, which uses moral pressure to persuade governments to treat their citizens properly. It does this by hearing complaints by private watchdog groups like Amnesty International, sending inspectors to investigate abuses, publishing reports and publicly rebuking offenders.
Diplomats here say that North-South tensions are likely to flare up over the details of how the commission will work. Some industrial nations, under pressure from domestic environmental lobbies, want advocacy groups, like Friends of the Earth or Greenpeace, to play a central prosecutorial role. These groups would file complaints against governments they feel are not keeping their Rio commitments.
In addition, governments will be encouraged to submit periodic reports to the commission on what they are doing to meet the ambitious goals established in Rio. These included a new international convention to combat global warming and stabilize climate, a blueprint for a wide-ranging environmental cleanup called Agenda 21, and another convention on protecting the diversity of living things -- something that President Bush refused to sign.
Indeed, the United States often found itself isolated, both at the Rio conference and in the protracted negotiations here that preceded it. In addition to Mr. Bush's refusal to countenance the so-called biodiversity treaty, American negotiators initially were at odds with the Western Europeans on the extent of the commitment necessary to combat global warming.
At this General Assembly session, many developing countries are expected to try to insulate themselves against outside criticism, which they regard as interference in their internal affairs. They would try to restrict the commission's powers and to limit the right of private environmental organizations to appear before it.
At the same time, these nations are likely to press the United States and others to make good on the still-vague pledges they made in Rio to give them more money and technology to help meet the cost of industrialization without damaging the environment.
The General Assembly got under way today by electing Bulgaria's Foreign Minister, Stoyan Ganev, as its president for the session, succeeding Samir S. Shihabi of Saudi Arabia.
The United States, the 12 European Community countries and Islamic nations immediately demanded the suspension of the delegation of Yugoslavia. The Security Council is considering a resolution urging Yugoslavia's suspension from this year's Assembly as a way of putting pressure on the Serbian-dominated Government in Belgrade to do more to promote peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
Further Polarization Feared
 But Russia, which could veto such a move, fears that punishing Belgrade in this way would only strengthen the more extreme Serbian nationalists.
Next Monday, President Bush is to address the 179-member Assembly at the start of a two-week general debate when heads of state and foreign ministers will set out their concerns in formal speeches.
Many of these speakers are expected to focus on sweeping proposals for strengthening the United Nations' peacekeeping and peacemaking roles, as set out earlier this year by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
European delegates may introduce a resolution later in the session adopting at least one of these suggestions by setting up a $50 million fund to pay start-up costs of new peacekeeping operations so that the operations can be launched more quickly.
But it remains unclear how much support the United States and other big nations will give to some of the Secretary General's other proposals, which include a controversial call for heavily armed "peace enforcement units" that would police cease-fires, as well as a suggestion that governments might pay peacekeeping bills more promptly if they made them items in their defense budgets.
While the end of the cold war has enabled the United Nations to play a more influential role in world affairs, this has principally benefited the Security Council, which is no longer paralyzed by the continuing threat of a Soviet veto.
The General Assembly has sought in recent years to rid itself of a reputation in the West as a debating society where third-world countries used their built-in majority to ram through unenforceable resolutions criticizing the industrial democracies.
Increasingly, the Assembly is trying to make its decisions unanimous. And at last year's session, a number of widely praised steps were taken, including a ban on drift-net fishing, which threatened to deplete stocks, and the appointment of a new official to coordinate international disaster relief.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Excerpts From Remarks by Clinton

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Gov. Bill Clinton's speech today to the convention of the National Guard Association here, as transcribed by Reuters.
I agree with the comment made by President Bush here today that we are facing a new and different global economic challenge. But I disagree that it has come on us all of a sudden.We have been in the midst of an emerging global economy for well over a dozen years now. And for a dozen years, we have been governed by a theory of economic response to that challenge, which has been euphemistically dubbed trickle-down economics. 
 The theory holds that Government has a very limited responsibility to help the American people prepare to compete and win in a global economy and that the most effective national Government is that which keeps taxes lowest on those who have the most money, because they will in turn invest that money in job growth and development in our country, making us stronger in global competition.
If you look at the last 12 years, we now have a chance to assess whether that theory has worked. In 1980 we had the highest wages in the world.Now we are 13th and dropping.
The census figures themselves demonstrate that over two-thirds of the American people, including most of the people enrolled in National Guard units in every state in the United States are working longer work weeks for lower wages than they were making 10 years ago, when you make adjustments for inflation.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Other nations with which we compete, which are growing more rapidly -- nations which realize that economic security is a part of national security and that in that sense national security has to begin at home -- have a totally different approach to the world's challenges.
And we must learn from that and craft a uniquely American approach.
I believe it is time to abandon trickle-down economics, not to go back to tax and spend and divide the pie, but to go forward with a theory that says we have to invest and educate and train and compete; that we do not have a person to waste; that we need a national economic strategy of partnership between Government, business, labor and education to dramatically increase the incentives for people in the private sector in new plant and equipment, in research and development, in the commercial technologies that will give us the same lead in the economy that the defense technologies give us on the battlefield and in training the best educated work force in America.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Over the last few months, as I have entered this race for President, I have had the opportunity to talk to a number of people who were active in the last two administrations who were called Reagan Democrats. Many of them have come home to support our campaign, not because I'm a Democrat, but because they believe in the defense policies I have outlined, and more importantly they know that national security begins with economic security.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ohio Voters;
Smattering of Fire but Mostly Unease in a District That Bush Carried in '88

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD, Ohio, Sept. 15

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, Jane Shade got so scared at what she saw on the nightly news that she did something she had never done before: she registered to vote.
What frightened the 30-year-old housewife was how well Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas was doing in the polls compared with her choice in the fall election, President Bush. 
 "I think George Bush is in trouble and he needs every vote he can get," Mrs. Shade said as she sat on her front steps here with her two young children. "If Clinton is elected, I'm scared taxes will go up."
On the other side of this middle-class suburb of tidy lawns, wooden porch swings and American flags almost as common as curtains, Michael Burke, 32, said he, too, had recently been shocked into action.
"This country can't afford another four years of George Bush and the Republicans," Mr. Burke said. "I registered to vote for the first time in my life about a month ago, right after I got laid off."
 
Once Solid, but Not Now
 Officials in both parties point to Ohio and its neighbors in the industrial heartland as a make-or-break front in the fall campaign. Recent history, at least, is on Mr. Bush's side.
Four years ago he handily won Ohio, including the largely white 19th Congressional District, where Lakewood is situated, about 10 miles west of Cleveland. The Democrats have carried the state only three times since 1948.
But things change. According to a new New York Times/CBS News poll, the contest in Ohio is a tossup.
Judging by the voices heard in Lakewood, where 97.2 percent of the 60,000 residents are white, the story is no different in this worried but comfortable pocket of America, which in 1992 had 9,762 registered Democrats, 4,115 Republicans and 22,360 independents.
"I voted for Bush the last time," said James Clay, a 30-year-old plate maker for a printing company. "Now it seems like he's kind of lost in the wilderness."
 
Turned Off by Both
 But others, like 31-year-old Marty Steward, a computer programmer, who voted against Mr. Bush last time, now say they are moving toward casting their ballot for him this time because "he is a known quantity."
Still, if the election were held today, disillusion and disgust would give both candidates a run for their money.
"I'm not happy about either guy," said Larry Lansberry, a 24-year-old auto-parts salesman. "I think I'll probably stay home on Election Day."
Even when people say they are supporting a particular candidate, many qualify their statements.
"I'll probably vote for Clinton," said Janet Birchard, a 49-year-old fraud investigator for the Cuyahoga County welfare office. "Why? Let me chose my words carefully: Because the alternative is so repulsive."
Ms. Birchard said health care was her No. 1 Presidential issue. In better times, character might be an issue, she said, but "it's not a primary concern to me because I think there are character flaws, serious ones, on both sides."
But here, as in so much of America, the most important issue on almost everyone's list was the economy. Education, homelessness and health care were frequently mentioned as major but still secondary issues in more than two dozen interviews.
As he hurried down Quail Street, a copy of "The Perfect Resume" under his arm, Robert Jacobs, 35, said: "I think Clinton has a good chance because of the economy. People want a change. We need one."
 
A Rock-Ribbed Republican
 Not everyone agrees. A few blocks away, Mike Greene, a 27-year-old car salesman, declared, "I'm 100 percent Republican. Always have been, always will be."
The economy, Mr. Greene said, is his primary concern, though national defense is also important. He said he considered Mr. Clinton weak on military and foreign affairs.
He said he was confident that most of his friends and co-workers would be voting for Mr. Bush. Then Mr. Greene tested his theory. "Anyone voting for Clinton?" he shouted with a smirk to his colleagues in the showroom.
Of the six salesmen nearby, only Duane R. Spence raised his hand.
"They just think they're Republicans," Mr. Spence said, flashing a smirk of his own at his co-workers. "But they don't make enough to be Republicans. They're fooling themselves."
Down Detroit Street, Wendy McKenzie was working her second job, at a flower shop. She is also a secretary.
"These days you have to work two jobs to get by," she said. "Right now, I'm leaning toward Bush. I have three kids and education is very, very important to me. I like Bush's voucher plan. My kids should be able to attend the school of their choice."
Ms. McKenzie, 31, is leaning but has not fallen. She said that she voted for Mr. Bush in 1988 but that she had not made up her mind this time.
So the door remains open for Mr. Clinton, though not as widely as a few weeks ago, before the latest reports about his draft record in the Vietnam War.
"I believe he's been lying about that," Ms. McKenzie said. "And if he's going to lie about that, what won't he lie about when it's really important?"
But for everyone who worried about Mr. Clinton's record, someone else held up Vice President Dan Quayle and his own military record as an antidote. Mr. Quayle served in the Indiana National Guard during the war.
Rose Slavick, 65, was making her neat lawn neater when she stopped to talk politics. An American flag was flying from her red-brick front porch.
"I have my flag out every day except rainy ones," she said. "I'm a patriot and a Democrat from way, way back. So was my father."
Mrs. Slavick said she would support Mr. Clinton. "He hasn't been totally honest about the draft business," she said, "but Quayle avoided it, too. So they're even-steven on that."
Deborah Dawson, a 31-year-old mental-health therapist, has not decided who to support. She voted for Mr. Bush in 1988 but said he had performed poorly ever since.
Still, she said, she has reservations about Mr. Clinton because "I'm concerned about his knowledge of world issues."

Bill Clinton for President. "I'm a patriot and a Democrat from way, way back." (Photographs by Roger Mastroianni for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Rebuild Base Destroyed by Storm

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
The Senate voted today to rebuild a vastly scaled-down Homestead Air Force Base into a mostly civilian complex, which would provide some relief toSouth Florida and head off a political quarrel.
The Senate Appropriations Committee last week rejected the Bush Administration's proposal to rebuild the base at a cost of $480 million, prompting charges from the White House that Democrats were not committed to rebuilding the hurricane-ravaged area. 
 Vice President Dan Quayle inserted Homestead into his campaign schedule last weekend to repeat the Administration's promise to do all it could to rebuild the air base, which has been an anchor to the local economy.
Florida's two Senators urged Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to reconsider the decision to close the base. But they settled for an amendment that restored $66 million to rebuild the control tower and the runway, replace radar, fuel tanks and electronic navigational equipment as well as to pay for an environmental cleanup.
The measure, which was passed by a voice vote of the full Senate, did not authorize the Air Force to redevelop the base, although it left open the possibility of a full reconstruction in the future. In all probability, Homestead will become a civilian airfield, although a Defense Department official said the Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies would probably use it.
Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, pressed to reinstate Homestead as a military base against a resistant Democratic leadership. But he went along with his Democratic colleague, Senator Bob Graham, in supporting the compromise, saying in an interview, "I would have liked a lot more, but in this business you take what you can get."
Aid for rebuilding the scaled-down field will come as part of a $10.47 billion bill providing emergency assistance, mostly directed at Florida and Louisiana. The legislation has already grown from the $7.45 billion approved by the Appropriations Committee last week, in large part as a result of the ravages of Hurricane Iniki on Hawaii. The committee had agreed to pass $26 million to clean up the base, a sum now added to the additional $66 million.
The appropriation bill passed easily by a vote of 84 to 10. The House is expected to take similar action.
Administration officials have strongly suggested that President Bush could veto the bill because he is unhappy with the decision not to rebuild the base in full, and with a provision that would prevent the Government from employing nonunion workers in federally financed construction projects.
The White House has also objected to a provision of the bill that would delay regulations restricting abortion counseling at federally financed clinics.
In an unusual break among Republicans on the Senate floor, Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, reprimanded the Administration for threatening to veto the legislation, and at least six other appropriation bills that Mr. Bush says are too expensive.
Noting that the 13 appropriation bills amount to less than what the Administration requested, Mr. Hatfield said: "We need to use the nation's resources to help fellow citizens in trouble."

HEADLINE: 2 KOREAS RESUME TALKS ON NEW TIES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 15

 BODY:
The Prime Ministers of North and South Korea opened a new round of talks tonight, amid concern that the effort to reconcile the two countries is stalling.
The two days of talks in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, mark the eighth round since the two countries began negotiating directly more than a year ago, and the first since Seoul's announcement last month that it was beginning diplomatic relations with North Korea's staunchest ally, China. So far the North Koreans, who denounced the former Soviet Union when it recognized South Korea, have said nothing about China's move. 
 Nonetheless, there has been widespread speculation that the opening to Beijing would so further isolate the North that it could slow the carrying out of an agreement of "reconciliation and nonaggression" signed in December.
So far the key elements of that agreement -- regular cross-border visits by relatives who have been separated for four decades, air and road traffic between the two countries, and verification that no nuclear weapons remain on the Korean Peninsula -- have gone unfulfilled.
 
Mutual Nuclear Inspections
 "It is more than disappointing to note that little tangible fruit has been reaped from the landmark agreement," The Korea Herald said in an editorial today.
A major sticking point for months has been the North's continued refusal to agree to a plan for mutual inspections of suspected nuclear sites in both countries. While the North Korean Government of President Kim Il Sung has recently permitted inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency into the country, South Korea, Japan and the United States have all said that the agency check is insufficient. The same agency, they note, missed signs of Iraq's secret nuclear project in the months before the Persian Gulf war.
"No substantial progress in relations between the South and the North will be possible without finding a bona fide resolution to the nuclear issue," Prime Minister Chung Won Shik of South Korea said in remarks prepared for tonight's opening dinner.
Until recently, there was speculation that the two sides would finally agree to a mutual inspection regime, probably limited to three or four sites on either side of the demilitarized zone. But in recent days, North Korea has stepped up its propaganda campaign against South Korea and the United States, asserting that the talks would not progress unless the South first closed a navy base that the North says is frequently visted by American nuclear-powered submarines.
Nonetheless, working-level groups in recent weeks have reportedly worked out a basic accord on economic cooperation, something that has been eagerly sought by both sides. The North is desperate for investment, and the South is hoping that any investments it makes will reduce the economic chaos when Mr. Kim, who is 80 years old, dies or the Government begins to crumble.

HEADLINE: POPULATION POLICY IN ASIA IS FAULTED

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Serious flaws in family-planning programs in China and India make it unlikely that the world's two most populous nations will be able to stabilize growth until well into the next century, by which time they may have added more than 1.5 billion people to the world's population, according to findings published this week by the independent Population Crisis Committee.
The problem is especially acute in India, the research group says. India, with a population of about 882 million that is growing 2.1 percent a year, is likely to overtake China as the most populous country by 2035, the committee says; India's population may reach 2 billion before leveling off. 
 China, with about 1.165 billion people, is likely to stabilize at about 1.5 billion, the group says.
The world's population is estimated at 5.4 billion.
 
Burdens on the Environment
 The continued growth in India and China contributes to an intensifying crisis in ecological and human resources in large areas of Asia, where land is being rapidly degraded by overuse, water supplies are under strain and agriculture must struggle to stay ahead of soil and water depletion.
Throughout Asia, there is no longer time to let economic development lead to smaller family size, as happened in industrial nations. Some Asian nations, led by South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, have made significant reductions in population growth through effective family planning.
"For people who are concerned about problems like global warming, ozone-layer depletion or world poverty, we just have to be vitally interested in the success or failure of the Chinese and Indian programs," said Sharon L. Camp, senior vice president of the Population Crisis Committee.
Copies of the reports are available for $5 each, including postage, from the Population Crisis Committee, 1120 19th Street, Washington, D.C. 20036.
 
India 'Most Critical'
 The studies of China and India conclude that the success of China's much-publicized population-control efforts have been "exaggerated," and that most couples have not one, but two or three children.
The situation in India is more dire.
"From a demographic perspective, India may be the world's most critical country," the Population Crisis Committee says. Nearly half the illiterate people in the world live in India, where a third of the people suffer from malnutrition.
The studies -- "India's Family Planning Challenge: From Rhetoric to Action" and "China's Family Planning Program: Challenging the Myths" -- call for more international assistance to the two countries, and more receptivity in Beijing and New Delhi to outside advice and help.
 
U.S. Angry With China
 Under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, however, Washington has denied family-planning aid to China because of coercive population-control programs, including forced abortions.
Under the influence of Republican conservatives, Washington also halted its contributions in 1985 to the United Nations Population Fund, citing its involvement in programs like China's. Washington supplied 20 percent of the fund's resources, and its withdrawal has hobbled the fund's work in both Asia and Africa.
The United States policy took shape in 1984, just before an international population conference in Mexico City, where Washington took a strong stand against abortion and population control in general. Abortions are used frequently in poor nations to regulate child-bearing.
Although Congress has been generous in appropriating money for programs in many other countries, and the United States Agency for International Development is a major contributor to family-planning programs worldwide, the policies on China and contributions to international organizations continue.
The reports on China and India, written by Ms. Camp and Shanti R. Conly, the committee's director of population policy analysis, fault both countries on the limited options available to women seeking contraception.
 
Flawed Technology
 In India, sterilization (mostly of women) accounts for 70 percent of contraception. Because of the near finality of the method and the risks to health from unsterile operations, many women wait until they have had four or more children, Indian experts say.
In China, an outdated and often risky steel-ring intrauterine device is used by 60 million women, the study says. About 36 percent of women rely on tubal ligation.
The roots of the problems are different. In India the Government has pledged a renewed effort to slow population growth, but many earlier efforts have been undercut by cultural resistance and a lack of political will. Conversely, in China, the determination of the Government to cut growth drastically led to Draconian measures that also aroused opposition.
But the Population Crisis Committee study found similarities in the shortcomings of the two nations' programs.
"Local programs in China and India are typically characterized by poorly trained personnel who lack both the interpersonal skills and technical knowledge necessary to adequately counsel clients on the risks and benefits of contraceptive measures," the committee said.

HEADLINE: Simi Valley Journal;
Spotlight of Trial Fades, Leaving Sense of Peace

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SIMI VALLEY, Calif., Sept. 12

 BODY:
Beneath multi-colored tents dotting the parking lot of a drive-in theater here, there was more brewing than the pots of chili competing for first place in the annual Simi Valley Days Festival.
Residents say they are still frustrated by the spotlight that burned brightly here more than four months ago, when a jury in the Simi Valley courthouse found four white Los Angeles police officers not guilty in the beating of a black motorist. 
 Strolling among the silver kettles of simmering chili here on Saturday, couples, grandparents and groups of young people tried to deflect questions about the verdict and focus on the simple pleasures of what was the start of a weeklong celebration of good will and community.
It would be nice, some said, to be known for the ethnically diverse chili mixtures. Or better still, for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library here, which has brought to Simi Valley such dignitaries as Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Reagan family.
This 12-mile long valley behind the Ventura County line boasts the "second-lowest crime rate on the West Coast." Now, the 100,000 residents, most of them white, are plagued by comparisons to Mississippi in the 1960's.
Since the verdict, there have been vandalism, anonymous telephone threats, demonstrations for and against the jury and white supremacists' rallies in Simi Valley.
"We were randomly selected for that trial, and now we've been selected as a place where people come to do these different items," said Mayor Gregory Stratton. "Our hope is that they will tire of it and leave us alone."
But that does not seem likely. On Saturday, as the first tastes of chili were being tried, a long planned demonstration against racism got under way across town at the courthouse. Richard Barrett, a Mississippi lawyer and leader of the small Nationalist Movement, and one follower had arrived to demonstrate in favor of the verdict, and 300 chanting protesters carrying picket signs and banners met them with shouted obscenities. Standing between the groups were 225 police officers and deputies from Simi Valley and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.
At the other end of town where the smell of spicy chili hung in the still hot valley air, the police and residents said Mr. Barrett's Nationalist Movement amounts to "a media show" that should be ignored.
Neils Winthers, an accountant and reserve police officer who spent the day with a fellow officer displaying to local children the workings of police sirens and radios, said he wished Mr. Barrett could be billed for money the city and county spent to protect him. "He's an opportunist and a manipulator who's using this as a way to get press and make money for his own personal game," Mr. Winthers said.
"There are more important things to be concerned with," said another officer, Jerry Dockers. "Like the chili bakeoff. And unemployment. And homelessness in Florida. We are not racists, and no one here shares his views. We're irate about this guy and just wish he'd go away."
"That verdict was a travesty, and only two of the jurors were actually from here," one resident said. "People read about this and think we're prejudiced people. They hear the wrong things. They think Simi Valley is something that it isn't."
What it is, says Mayor Stratton, is a community filled with residents concerned about law and order, a place "where residents are taught that the policeman is their friend." In recent months, he said, there has been "a tremendous self-consciousness, self-awareness and self-pride. We're forced to look at ourselves, and I don't think we found anything all that bad."
City manager Mike Sedell agreed. "Residents had to look inward to what they had here, and they found that what they built was truly theirs; a community where people are more concerned with how their neighbors maintain their yards than with the color of their skin."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview;
Bush Subtly Avoids Direct Attack Against Clinton on the Draft Issue

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 15

 BODY:
In a day marked by some of the most subtle political jousting of the campaign, President Bush today took note of the controversy over Gov. Bill Clinton's draft record but said he did not want to attack his opponent over it. Instead, he invited an audience of National Guard officers to compare the candidates' credentials to be Commander in Chief.
Standing in front of a big blue curtain and flanked by American flags before several thousand conventioneers of the National Guard Association, Mr. Bush began his thrusts at Mr. Clinton by noting, as if in an aside, that "there has been a lot of controversy swirling around about service to country, about using influence to avoid the military." 
 Referring to recent news reports, he added: "And I've read a great deal of speculating saying that I was going to come out here and use this forum to attack Governor Clinton. I want to tell you, I do feel very strongly about certain aspects of the controversy swirling around Governor Clinton. But I didn't come here to attack him."
Even as he disclaimed any intention to attack the Democratic nominee, Mr. Bush drew several implicit comparisons, each pointing to the same conclusion: that Mr. Clinton was not to be trusted as the nation's military leader. [Excerpts, page A18.]
Mr. Bush's digs at Mr. Clinton over his draft record were mostly indirect and heavily veiled, an approach that allowed the President to maintain a dignified distance from what might be taken as negative campaigning.
But this approach also allowed the Arkansas Governor, who spoke to the same group shortly after Mr. Bush, to ignore the President's remarks. Instead, Mr. Clinton, after asserting he had the backbone to make military decisions, turned the subject back to one that favors him: the economy.
Referring to the "trickle-down" concept of economic growth, Mr. Clinton said, "If you look at the last 12 years, we now have a chance to assess whether that theory has worked," he said. "In 1980, we had the highest wages in the world; now we are 13th and dropping. The census figures themselves demonstrate that over two-thirds of the American people, including most of the people enrolled in National Guard units in every state in the United States, are working longer work weeks for lower wages than they were making 10 years ago."
The audience responded to both men with polite, but not overwhelming, enthusiasm.
The speeches followed a day of tactical moves. By announcing he would appear in place of Vice President Dan Quayle, Mr. Bush raised expectations that he would jab at Mr. Clinton's lack of a service record and his youthful expressions of "loathing" for the military. Expectations were heightened further when Mr. Clinton altered his schedule to respond to an anticipated attack.
 
The Rebuttal Was Ready
 But Mr. Bush's speech was not as direct an attack as the Clinton campaign had feared. Clinton campaign officials said they knew halfway through Mr. Bush's draft-related remarks that they would not have to use the rebuttal speech that Paul Begala, a top Clinton aide, and several other campaign strategists had worked on until 4 A.M.
Bush strategists exulted over the fact that their threat of a Presidential attack on Mr. Clinton's greatest area of vulnerability had forced the Democratic candidate to alter his schedule.
"A trap? Let's just say we can't believe he walked into it," said Torie Clarke, a spokeswoman for the Republican campaign.
Clinton aides claimed triumph on the assertion that their rapid response to Mr. Bush's threat had forced him to soften his attack, thus leaving Mr. Clinton free to ignore the President's digs.
In his speech, Mr. Bush offered a retrospective defense of the National Guard and of Mr. Quayle for the pounding he said both had taken four years ago. He said that Mr. Quayle had been "savagely attacked and ridiculed by the national press for going into the National Guard," and that the Guard had been attacked "as a haven for draft dodgers."
The defense of Mr. Quayle had a sharp point to it, giving Mr. Bush an opening for an indirect criticism of the way Mr. Clinton has handled questions on his draft record.
 
'He Stood His Ground'
 "No candidate has ever been attacked more unmercifully than Vice President Quayle," Mr. Bush said. "But he stood his ground. And he answered every question calmly and with candor, and he told the truth. And this is service to country."
Having thus implicitly raised questions about the way Mr. Clinton had handled similar questions about his draft days, Mr. Bush asked, almost reflectively: "Why do these questions even matter? Why are they part of our national debate?"
"They matter," Mr. Bush said, "because, despite all our problems at home, we can never forget that we ask our Presidents to lead the military, to bear the awful authority of deciding to send your sons and daughters in harm's way."
As Mr. Bush recalled a letter he received from a mother whose son, a helicopter pilot, had died in the Persian Gulf war, his voice grew thick and cracked with emotion.
"And does this mean that if you've never seen the awful horror of battle that you can never be Commander in Chief? Of course not. Not at all," he said. "But it does mean that we must hold our Presidents to the highest standard, because they might have to decide if our sons and daughters should knock early on death's door."
 
No Serious Damage Found
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that the draft issue has yet to seriously hurt Mr. Clinton: 79 percent of the voters said assertions that he manipulated his draft status would have no effect on their vote, while 14 percent said those accusations would incline them to vote against him. Still, the Republicans have only begun to emphasize that issue, and some political experts say its effect will not be clear unless, and until, it is incorporated in the Republicans' television advertising.
The poll does show that some voters harbor doubts: 25 percent said they did not think Mr. Clinton was telling the truth about how he avoided the draft, while 42 percent said they thought he was. By way of contrast, 55 percent of the voters said Mr. Bush had been hiding things the public needed to know about the Iran-contra affair.
Clinton aides said they had expected a more direct assault and said they saw Mr. Bush's glancing references as an opportunity. "We recognized that it was an implicit attack, but it was so scaled-back that we were not forced to respond," said one Clinton campaign official. "That gave us a huge opening to turn the subject back to the economy, back to our turf."
Thus, Mr. Clinton, speaking without notes and appearing relaxed, took the podium and gave a speech that mixed calls for a strong defense and a well-equipped National Guard with a long disquisition on economic renewal.
Judging from scattered samples of reaction among the mostly middle-aged, crisply-uniformed men in the room, Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton were both reasonably well received, with Mr. Clinton's economic message seeming to register more strongly with some than Mr. Bush's speech.
"I understood what the President was doing, saying he didn't want to make references to his opponent's problems, and then going ahead and subtly making them," said Maj. Kent Demars, of the Utah Army National Guard. "But the economy is the big issue, as far as I'm concerned. And the Governor's speech was much better."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Poll;
Clinton Retains a Wide Lead in Latest Survey

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Despite President Bush's efforts to rebuild his political base, Gov. Bill Clinton is holding on to both a significant lead in this race and the support of important elements of the Reagan-Bush coalition, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
The poll shows Mr. Clinton with strong backing from young people, suburbanites, independents, Roman Catholics and Democrats who said they voted for Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush.
 
Emphasis on the Economy
 Riding a wave of economic discontent, the Democratic nominee now has the backing of 49 percent of the voters over all, compared with 37 percent who say they are supporting Mr. Bush, the poll shows. Despite Mr. Bush's efforts to refocus his campaign and repackage his economic agenda, those standings are essentially unchanged from the last Times/CBS poll three weeks ago. 
 The public mood remains ominous for the President, with 63 percent of all adults saying that most American families today are worse off financially than they were four years ago.
The economy is far and away the biggest issue on voters' minds. When asked what issue the candidates should be talking about most, 46 percent said economic problems. Only 1 percent said candidates should most emphasize "family values," one of the central themes of the Republican convention. The Bush campaign has de-emphasized that theme in recent days.
In general, there were signs of potential tightening in the race. Voters are now closely divided over which candidate they expect to win in November, whereas in early August they were overwhelmingly predicting a Clinton victory. Moreover, Mr. Clinton's favorability rating has slipped, and Mr. Bush showed some slight improvement in his job ratings, especially in foreign policy.
For all of that, the poll highlights the formidable task facing Mr. Bush and his new political team, headed by James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff. Conducted Wednesday to Sunday, the poll provides a detailed look at the electorate now that both party conventions are over, the dramatic swings in public opinion associated with them have wound down and the race has entered its autumn stretch.
The survey, based on telephone interviews with 1,329 adults, including 1,006 registered voters, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The poll shows that Reagan Democrats have returned in large numbers to the party of their heritage. Fifty-nine percent of the Democrats who said they voted for Mr. Bush in 1988 said they supported Mr. Clinton today, along with 64 percent of the Democrats who said they voted for Mr. Reagan in 1984.
Other groups that provided the Republicans with important support in the 1980's are also now with Mr. Clinton. The Democrat has a 2-to-1 edge among voters aged 18-to-29, for example, and is also the choice of 48 percent of suburban voters, compared with 38 percent who say they are backing Mr. Bush.
Catholic voters, a crucial group in the industrial Midwest and such big Eastern states as Pennsylvania, are also breaking Mr. Clinton's way, 47 percent to 37 percent. Mr. Bush has tried to target Catholic voters with promises of tuition vouchers that could be used in parochial schools.
From an ideological standpoint, the poll suggests that Mr. Bush's efforts to shore up his conservative base this year have left him vulnerable among the voters in the center. Thirty-two percent of the voters who consider themselves independents say they are backing Mr. Bush, while 47 percent say they are supporting Mr. Clinton. Similarly, just 29 percent of the voters who consider themselves moderates are backing Mr. Bush, while 55 percent are backing Mr. Clinton.
 
Bush's Foundation
 Not surprisingly, Mr. Bush is running strongly among conservatives, where he leads Mr. Clinton 62 percent to 28 percent, and among those who define themselves as religious fundamentalists. The President also shows strength among those ages 30 to 44, where he is trailing Mr. Clinton by only four percentage points, and among those ages 65 and older, where the candidates are virtually tied.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton are evenly dividing the votes of whites, who went heavily Republican in the last three elections.
Still, Mr. Clinton is running ahead of Mr. Bush in this poll in every region of the country. A separate poll, focused on Ohio, which Mr. Bush almost certainly needs to carry to reach the 270 electoral votes necessary to win, shows the race there to be a statistical dead heat.
The overall rankings of the Times/ CBS News poll track those of other polls released by news organizations in recent days. A Newsweek poll issued last weekend showed Mr. Clinton with a 15-point lead. The ABC News-Washington Post poll released this week showed Mr. Clinton with 54 percent, to 38 percent for Mr. Bush.
 
Bad News, and Good
 The economy continues to drive this election and darken the public's mood. Forty-six percent said future generations of Americans would be worse off than people today, for example, while only 22 percent said they would be better off.
And the poll suggests that Mr. Bush is being harshly judged for his response to the economic downturn; only 27 percent said the President had offered specific ideas for getting the country out of recession, while 53 percent said Mr. Clinton had.
On the other hand, Mr. Bush is given a strong edge in his conduct of international affairs, with 62 percent saying they are confident in his ability to handle an international crisis, while only 27 percent say they are confident about Mr. Clinton in that situation.
Mr. Bush is also given the edge on trustworthiness to handle "all the problems" that will confront a President. Forty-nine percent said they would trust Mr. Bush on this front, while 44 percent said Mr. Bush might make a serious mistake. Fifty-two percent had that fear about Mr. Clinton.
Both candidates are judged skeptically on taxes. Fifty-eight percent said they did not believe that Mr. Bush would deliver on his promise to cut taxes across the board, and 63 percent said they did not believe that Mr. Clinton was any less likely than past Democratic candidates to raise taxes and increase Federal spending. And 52 percent said Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton were equally likely to raise taxes.
 
Caring and Credibility
 Mr. Clinton is given the edge on compassion and empathy. Sixty-seven percent said the Governor cared about their needs and problems, while only 44 percent said Mr. Bush cared.
In general, 32 percent said they held a favorable opinion of Mr. Clinton, while 29 percent said they held unfavorable views. The positive rating was a slight decline from the last poll, when 36 percent saw the Democratic Governor favorably. Still, it is better than the 31 percent favorable, 44 percent unfavorable rating given Mr. Bush.
There were a few signs of improvement for Mr. Bush. His approval rating was up to 42 percent, from 38 percent in the poll after the Republican National Convention in mid-August. He was given better marks on his handling of foreign affairs, 56 percent approval, up from 48 percent before the convention. And 64 percent said they approved of the way the President handled the Federal response to Hurricane Andrew.
 
The Perot Factor
 There were some intriguing hints of two wild cards if the race turns out to be tight. Ross Perot retains a significant following, with 14 percent of the registered voters saying they would vote for Mr. Perot if they see his name on the ballot, which they are likely to do.
And the poll suggests that the contrast between Vice President Dan Quayle and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, Mr. Clinton's running mate, is costing the Republicans about three percentage points. When asked to suppose they were voting only for President, and not Vice President, too, 50 percent of the voters said they preferred Mr. Clinton and 41 percent Mr. Bush.

How the Two Polls Were Taken
 The latest nationwide New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 1,329 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, of whom 1,006 said they were registered voters.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike.
In addition, throughout the state of Ohio telephone interviews were conducted Saturday through Monday with 867 adults, of whom 678 said they were registered voters. The sample of Ohio telephone numbers was provided by Survey Sampling Inc. of Fairfield, Conn.
For both polls, within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll. The results of each poll have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations relating to region, race, sex, and age. The national poll was also weighted by education.
In theory, in 19 cases of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than a few percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all registered voters in the population. For the national poll it is plus or minus three points; for the Ohio poll it is plus or minus four.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for results based on registered voters 18 to 29 years old nationwide, it is plus or minus eight percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. (pg. A17)

HEADLINE: U.S. Regulators Scale Back Rise In Banking Fees

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Bowing to political pressure, Federal regulators today cut in half a proposed increase in the insurance premiums that banks pay to the deposit insurance fund -- and exempted three-quarters of the industry from any increase at all.
The decision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to set the rate increase at an average of 10.4 percent, half the amount proposed in May, came after intense lobbying by the Bush Administration and the banking industry. 
 The increase takes effect on Jan. 1, two weeks after regulators will begin to seize more troubled banks under a new banking law. The higher premiums are intended to cover the cost of insuring depositors in these failing banks.
 
Treasury Holds Sway
 The unanimous action reflects the tightening grip by the Treasury Department over the agency just three weeks after the sudden death of its chairman, William Taylor. He had sought an average increase of 22 percent, to 28 cents for every $100 in deposits, and had provided the swing vote in May for tentative approval of that increase.
Banks now pay insurance premiums of 23 cents for every $100 in deposits. After Jan. 1, the strongest institutions would continue to pay the current rate, the weakest banks and savings associations would pay 31 cents, and the average increase would be 2.4 cents.
The Administration has sought in this election year to convey the impression that the worst is behind the banking and savings and loan industries and it pointed to today's decision as a kind of ratification of that view.
"I think this is a reasonable approach," said Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson, who played the
pivotal role for the Administration in shaping the new rates. "It recognizes the fact the industry has had a substantial improvement over the past few months."
But many bank analysts and regulators believe that a recent surge in the industry's earnings is only temporary, a creation of this year's drastic plunge in interest rates. Those low rates have enabled the banks and savings associations to widen the difference between the amount they charge borrowers and the yields they pay depositors, and also earn new revenue from the wave of mortgage refinancings. The banks have also made money on government securities, which they have been holding in record amounts, even as they have been making fewer corporate and real estate loans.
As the anemic economy and high unemployment have become dominating issues in the Presidential campaign, the Administration has moved vigorously to relax lending, appraisal and examination regulations in an effort to stimulate more borrowing. It has also effectively abandoned its quest for more money from Congress for the stalled bailout of the savings and loan industry, which by some estimates will wind up costing taxpayers about $500 billion, including interest, over the next 40 years.
But critics like Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, have accused the regulators of playing politics with bank failures and putting off the industry's troubles until after the election.
Mr. Gonzalez and other Democrats today challenged the decision to halve the proposed increase, arguing that the deposit corporation should have used the climate of strong bank earnings to shore up the insurance fund.
"The board's reluctance to raise premiums further sends the misleading message that all is well in the banking industry and that the worst is behind us," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who is a senior member of the Banking Committee. "The F.D.I.C. basically caved to the banks. If we learned anything in the 80's, it's that you need to set up a cushion in the good times to get you through the bad times."
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, called the vote "a mistake" that puts "at greater risk" the repayment of the huge loan granted by Congress last year to the F.D.I.C. to keep it afloat.
"When the industry is reporting record profits is precisely the time it can most easily afford to rebuild the bank insurance fund," he said in a letter earlier this week.
But Mr. Robson disagreed, saying fees should be set based on anticipated need, not on the resources of the industry. "It should be run on an actuarial basis and not on the ability to pay at the moment," he said.
Bank executives applauded the F.D.I.C. decision but some said it should have gone further and not raised the average rates at all.
At the end of June, the insurance fund that protects $3 trillion in bank deposits had a deficit of $5.5 billion and even with the new premium increases, the fund is not expected to show a positive balance until well after the year 2000.
Today's vote on the premium increase is the final action on a plan to have stronger banks pay less insurance and weaker banks pay more, ending the 58-year-old system of having all banks pay the same rate.
The increase will raise an additional $600 million from banks and $180 million from savings associations.

HEADLINE: Fernandez to Let Students Transfer to Any District

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez will let parents send their children to any school outside their district throughout New York City's five boroughs next year, giving the city one of the largest school-choice arrangements in the nation.
The plan will let a Staten Island parent shift a child as far away as the north Bronx or a parent from a shabby quarter of Jackson Heights, Queens, send a child to a tidy suburban patch of Bayside, Queens. Parents who live in boroughs outside Manhattan but work there will be able to drop their children off at schools near their offices, as long as space is available. 
 The plan, which applies to elementary and junior high schools but not to high schools, requires no formal approval by the Board of Education, said Robin Willner, Mr. Fernandez's director of strategic planning.
A nine-page draft has been circulating among the city's 32 district superintendents for their suggested revisions, but Mr. Fernandez, who has long advocated the principle of choice, is committed to going ahead with the basic ideas in the plan in time for next September's schools opening, aides said.
School choice is perhaps the most talked about idea in education today, with both Presidential candidates endorsing the concept in different forms. Since 1988, 13 states have adopted some version. Advocates of choice say that it will stimulate competition among schools, forcing less successful ones to improve their instruction or risk losing their students.
How many of the city's 700,000 elementary and junior high school pupils might take advantage of such a plan is unclear. Moreover, the plan will be limited by several unshakable realities, including no money for transportation, overcrowding in many of the best schools and a reluctance by some superintendents to participate.
Experience in the states that have adopted plans for choice has shown that relatively few parents will send their children to places where they may encounter unfamiliar streets or cultures. In Minnesota, for example, less than 1 percent -- roughly 20,000 children -- took advantage of a statewide open-enrollment plan.
However, the denser urban landscape of New York, with its sprawling subway and bus system, suggests that the experience of relatively rustic Minnesota may not be conclusive. Indeed, tenacious parents have always been able to find ways of sending children to preferable schools outside their immediate zones, often using relatives' addresses as their own in hopes of getting into a school they want in what one superintendent called a "black market economy."
"The people who are more knowledgable and able to manipulate the system have had better access to that economy," said Anthony J. Alvarado, superintendent of District 2 in Manhattan. "What the regulation does is put the rules on the table for everybody."
 
Popular but Overcrowded
 Some choice is already available. Mr. Alvarado is among a handful of the city's superintendents who have experimented with letting parents choose any school within their district, and who have accepted students from outside the district as well.
Still, the New York plan faces some obstacles. Many of the system's 633 elementary and 179 intermediate schools are overcrowded and cannot squeeze in students from other districts. Other popular ones like Public School 87 on the West Side of Manhattan already have to turn back scores of students from inside and outside their districts.
The Fernandez plan still guarantees enrollment to children who live in a school's geographic zone, leaving only unfilled seats for inter-district transfers. The plan also says that children who live within the district, though not within a school's immediate zone, have priority over children who live outside the district.
With the system's threadbare budget, there is no money available for large-scale bus transportation, though children will still be able to use bus and subway passes given to students who live more than a mile and a half from their schools. But Ms. Willner said that Mr. Fernandez asked officials on Monday to study the rerouting of some bus routes for inter-district transfers.
A key to the plan's effectiveness is the cooperation of the district superintendents, who must approve any transfers into their districts. Some superintendents of stable districts are reluctant to ruffle the calm by opening their doors to outsiders who may include unruly or laggard students. Max Messer, superintendent of District 8 in the east Bronx and the head of the Association of Superintendents, said he saw merits to the plan but was worried that some schools seeking to entice students might offer deceptive advertising. Other superintendents are said to be worried about having students lured away.
 
Concept of Choice Legitimized
 Nevertheless, the mere fact of the existence of a choice plan is guaranteed to change the city's schoolgoing patterns and traditions.
"The Chancellor has legitimized the concept of choice, which we accept in every aspect of our life," said Sy Fliegel, a former district superintendent who has become a nationally known champion of choice. "People will no longer say, 'I don't want to be in this school.' Now you are here because you want to be here."
Some parents are concerned that mediocre schools will be stripped of their best and brightest students, who will seek out other schools. Others, however, are delighted.
"We should all have the choice of sending our children where we think it's more fitting," said Nadine Dominique, a Brooklyn parent. "If you don't live in a nice area, your child is stuck going to a school even if it's not up to par."
Her family, of Haitian origin, already provides an illustration of how choice would work. She lives in Midwood, but did not like the crumbling classrooms of one school near her home and the small number of black teachers at another. She now drops off her 6-year-old, David Ashley Dominique, at the Midtown West School on West 47th Street -- a vest-pocket school whose multicultural approach she favors -- then continues by subway to her job in the Wall Street area.
Members of the Board of Education have been consulted, and none objected to the concept, said H. Carl McCall, the president. Sandra Feldman and Donald Singer, presidents of the teachers and principals unions respectively, said they liked the plan overall, but had some misgivings about what could happen to schools that students began to forsake.
Ms. Feldman said she hoped the school system would offer help to schools that lose substantial enrollment, while Mr. Singer said the plan should begin in a only a few pilot districts to test its impact.
"Otherwise schools that need resources will wind up with less and less," Mr. Singer said.
Some districts, particularly in Manhattan, already informally permit transfers when space allows. At P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village, many students are children of workers at St. Vincent's Hospital nearby who do not live in the district and, said Mr. Alvarado, lend the school diversity.
The new plan says nothing about transferring children between schools within the same school district, since those decisions are up to local school boards. Districts like 2, 3 and 4 in Manhattan already permit children to enroll in any school within the district. The plan also says nothing about the high schools, which are controlled by the central Board of Education and already permit options for enrollment far from home.
 
2 Permissions Not Needed
 The plan was described in a detailed nine-page draft that was provided to The New York Times by a high school official who is in favor of the plan. There have been earlier news articles in which Mr. Fernandez spoke about his plans to broaden choice for parents and to let parents send children near where they work.
The plan's major departure is that it permits a transfer with only the permission of the so-called "receiving" district, not the "sending" one. Until now, permission of both superintendents was required. Many superintendents were reluctant to release students because the loss meant an accompanying loss of city, state and Federal dollars.
The plan says that students can transfer out of the district to a school closer to a parent's workplace, to a school offering a "more appropriate" curriculum, to a school that offers better health or safety conditions or has a more robust guidance program, or for "other special circumstances." Mr. Fliegel said that in those four reasons most parents should be able to find a valid pretext for a transfer.
The plans forces superintendents to provide a valid reason for rejecting applicants, and it restricts the ability of principals or superintendents to weed out students or parents they don't like. It discourages interviews and home-made tests, for example, though it permits the use of standardized tests or auditions for so-called gifted and talented programs.
 
Recruiting Is Possibility
 Ms. Willner said the Chancellor preferred that school use random selection systems or "first come, first served" as a basis for admission.
Any recruitment program, the plan says, would have to be reviewed by the board's office of zoning and integration to make sure it does not increase the numbers of segregated classes in the system.

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 15

 BODY:
A poll published on Monday by the National Association of Business Economists found two-thirds of the membership expecting that the Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton, would be elected in November and that economic growth under him would probably be higher than during a second Bush term.
 Of 243 respondents to the survey, 52.8 percent said growth would be better under Mr. Clinton, 22.7 percent said it would be worse and 24.5 percent said it would be the same. A majority, 52.8 percent, also said that regulation, inflation, the budget deficit and interest rates would be higher than under Mr. Bush while the dollar and the stock market would be lower. 
 A majority also held that the trade deficit under Mr. clinton would be either higher than during a second Bush term or would be no different than under Mr. Bush.

The primary boycott refers to the concerted policy of all 20 Arab states to refrain from diplomatic, political, economic and cultural relations with Israel. The secondary boycott is an effort to punish commercial companies all over the world with economic ties to Israel. Only 12 Arab nations, principally the Persian Gulf states and Libya, participate in that boycott. 
 States joining in the secondary boycott are listed by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, as required by our Export Administration Act. The secondary boycott is administered by the Arab League from Damascus.
The Arab League boycott regulations forbid dealing with private companies that violate any of 13 specified prohibitions. These include establishing a factory or general agency in Israel, providing technical advice to Israeli companies, investing in Israeli enterprises or being controlled by "pro-Zionist natural persons."
Curiously there is no specific ban on the purchase of Israeli goods or the sale to Israel of foreign goods. The boycott regulations do not, as you state, refer to "strategic goods" in prescribing which products may or may not be sold to Israel.
A company violating boycott regulations may be placed on the Arab blacklist, which theoretically denies it contracts with Arab countries or customers. In practice, however, the Arab states ignore the regulations when it is to their advantage.
Thus, Saudi Arabia allowed the Coca-Cola Company to build a plant in the kingdom although it was on the Arab League blacklist. General Electric, which sells Israel fighter-plane engines, has never been blacklisted, nor has any other prominent military contractor, for the simple reason that the Arab states rely on these contractors for their own military supplies.
The Arab boycott is weakening. Kuwait, which had been most energetic in enforcing boycott regulations, quickly dropped its boycott, at least against American companies, after Desert Storm. It would require only a slight push from the Bush-Baker team to persuade Saudi Arabia to follow Kuwait's example. If Saudi Arabia, the largest Arab market for Western goods, abandoned its secondary boycott, the boycott would quickly collapse. Such a move would of course be a help to American companies that must compete with foreign companies not subject to anti-boycott restrictions in their own countries.
There is a widespread sentiment in Congress for an end to the boycott. The Wirth amendment forbidding the award of defense contracts to foreign companies complying with the boycott was adopted last September by a vote of 99 to 0. More recently the Republican Party platform adopted last month specifically called for an end to the boycott. A slight push should topple this outstanding obstruction to the principle of free trade.

Great Expectations

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
When liberal Democrats talk about the Presidential election these days, they seem a bit like the bride determined that the groom not see her before the ceremony. They fear a jinx -- the jinx of optimism in this, their best-chance year in many years.
Which goes some way toward explaining why, if Bill Clinton wins -- don't say it, don't say it, don't even say it, they keen in certain circles, afraid of the unfamiliar feel of hope -- he will take office with the enormous curse of great expectations. 
 You can sense it even now, one enormous what-if intake of breath in a body politic. Like some Arkansas Atlas with other people's stuff sitting on his shoulders, Mr. Clinton will have traded in his own considerable baggage for the weight of a party that has been waiting to take power for a generation, a generation that has wondered how one of its own would shape public policy, and a public that is tired of more of the same.
Someone should make the guy a sampler: Be careful what you wish for; you might get it.
It is true that Mr. Clinton could make an enormous impact with certain constituencies early on. And he could do it with one hand tied behind his back. With the other, he could sign the Freedom of Choice Act, making access to abortion a legal right for American women, and the family leave bill, which provides for time off to care for a newborn, a sick child or a failing parent.
He could end the indefensible ban on gays in the military and order the F.D.A. to consider RU-486, the French abortion pill, purely on its medical merits, which would likely lead to its approval. President Clinton could make Mario Cuomo, Laurence Tribe or someone less showy but equally inclined to civil liberties a justice of the Supreme Court.
But those acts do not a hundred days make. Too moderate for some liberals, too liberal for some moderates; too business-oriented for environmentalists, too environmentally hip for big business types; too busy being preternaturally ambitious to be a true child of the counterculture, too hamstrung by political realities to make the sweeping changes implicit in the generational and party differences between him and his opponent -- Bill Clinton has a historic opportunity to disappoint.
This is partly, too, because the big issue of this campaign may be one that no one can crack. Mr. Bush's original problem with the economy was not inaction. It was reaction. He insisted that things were O.K.
I don't know why no adviser told the President that nothing makes a working person idled by a recession madder than being told everything is fine, except maybe hearing members of Congress moan about their salaries. Even today Mr. Bush is constitutionally incapable of talking about how bad things are without a chirpy addendum that recovery is right around the corner.
But the irony is that expectations for Mr. Bush, should he be re-elected, would be comparatively low; he need only do better than his first term, which would not be difficult. Many Americans, even some of his supporters, have accepted that the economy is an alligator and Mr. Bush is no alligator wrestler.
But empathy with our hard times will not be enough for Mr. Clinton, should he win. He has said he can wrestle the alligator, and he will be held to it. Caught between party stalwarts who never met an entitlement program they didn't like and long-view guys like Paul Tsongas, who say it's time to get serious about the deficit despite the sacrifice required -- and who admit that this is a difficult thing for an elected official who likes the sound of the words "second term" -- Mr. Clinton is certain to let part of his constituency down.
You can tell that some voters are hearing "Happy Days Are Here Again" in the poll figures and focus groups. People who feared they would not see a Federal abortion statute or an end to discrimination against gay citizens in the armed forces in their lifetime try to stop themselves from hoping too much.
Hoping too much can be a problem. While Mr. Clinton and his people are concentrating on the first Tuesday in November, they need to wrestle soon with how to mute and milk the sweeping expectations that accompany their unexpected good fortune. Otherwise the background music might well be Fred Astaire: "I'm Building Up to an Awful Let-Down."

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Goes Astray on Recession

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the third year of the recession, Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, is still fighting inflation. Yes, the Fed is supposed to fight inflation. William McC. Martin Jr., Fed chief under five Presidents, said in effect: "Our job is to lean against the economic winds. If an inflationary wind is blowing, we lean against that. If a deflationary wind is blowing, and prices fall, we do the opposite."
But the Fed's actions affect the economy in many ways, and it should do more, within its powers, to help the whole economy. This, Mr. Greenspan did not do. For example, the Fed, through its open market committee, could have bought more Treasury securities from the banks, giving the banks additional cash reserves for more generous loan policies toward business. This would have acted as a powerful stimulant for business to hire more people and give more jobs. 
 Instead, Mr. Greenspan relied on incrementally lowering the bank discount rate, thereby lowering interest rates generally. In a short-lived recession, like those from World War II up to the Bush Administration, this would stimulate business. But this is not a mercifully short recession.
Mr. Greenspan's policy of lowering the bank discount rate (and the whole complex of interest rates, and doing nothing else) had the effect of causing savers to transfer their savings out of the savings institutions because interest rates became so low. Savings then went into the stock market, boosting the value of stock shares, but not creating jobs.

Insurer to Buy Olympia Office Tower

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Four days after New York City signed a bill granting tax breaks to property owners who modernize aging office buildings, Mutual of America said it had reached an agreement to buy and improve a vacant office tower on 320 Park Avenue from Olympia & York Developments Ltd..
The building, which has an asbestos problem, formerly served as the headquarters for the ITT Corporation and has reportedly cost Olympia & York about $20 million a year in taxes, upkeep and interest payments in the two years since it has had a prime tenant. 
 Mutual of America, the New York-based life insurer, intends to move from its leased space at 666 Fifth Avenue. It said it would need only a third of the 34-story building to house some 600 employees. It plans to fill the rest by investing $70 million into the building to remove the asbestos, improve its energy efficiency and give the facade a face lift.
 
Deal Aided by Law
 The purchase price was not disclosed, but Olympia & York has a $147 million mortgage on the property and had been asking $130 million to $150 million. One person involved in the deal said the price was in that range but fell short of the mortgage. That wrinkle complicated the negotiation, because Olympia & York had to work out an arrangement to deal with any shortfall with the syndicate of lenders, led by First Chicago, which holds the mortgage.
The deal, under negotiation for months, would reportedly never have been concluded without the passage on Friday of a bill giving strong financial incentives to property owners who buy and improve office towers south of 96th Street over the next two years. Owners who qualify for the program will see no change in their tax bills for eight years, after which the adjustments will be phased in.
Though Mutual of America's president, Thomas Moran, declined to estimate the value of those future tax benefits, real estate executives said that they would be worth the equivalent of $20 million today.
Mutual of America, which had spent five years searching for new headquarters in New York State so it could remain under the supervision of New York's insurance regulators, was believed to have lined up an attractive counteroffer on Long Island, and had conditioned any deal with Olympia & York on approval of the bill.
"We thought Mutual of America was at significant risk of leaving the city and we're delighted about their commitment to stay here and make a long-term commitment," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-government agency.
 
Others to Benefit
 Other companies that are expected to benefit from the package of tax breaks are Prudential Securities and Barney's, though the tax breaks were not believed to be as crucial to their deals. Prudential, for instance, recently agreed to take space at One New York Plaza, in part because the building's owners agreed to pass along some of the expected tax benefits to it in the price of its lease. Barney's, a retailer with a strong downtown presence, was already renovating a midtown property where it hopes to open a new store when the new bill was signed.
"We're thrilled that the revised industrial development program, which the Mayor signed last week, has played such a critical role, exactly the kind of role we had hoped it to play," Mr. Weisbrod said, noting that the Mutual of America deal alone was expected to create 1,000 construction jobs.
The pending sale comes on the heels of another deal last week in which Olympia & York agreed to transfer control of a troubled property it owns at 55 Water Street to its bondholders. By pruning those portions of its American holdings that are in poor financial health, Olympia & York hopes to keep its healthier American properties out of a messy bankruptcy filing.
Until the recent office glut, both buildings, 55 Water Street and 320 Park Avenue, had been among the trophy properties in Olympia & York's glittering real estate empire.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
A Cheaper Way of Linking Offices

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Anticipating adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Mexican telephone company is about to initiate a sophisticated network service that should make it easier for multinational corporations to do business with, and within, Mexico.
The service, known as virtual private networks, is already wildly popular among business customers in the United States, allowing corporations to link far-flung branch offices with voice and data-communications circuits that can make phoning from coast to coast almost as fast and easy as calling a co-worker across the hall -- and at rates much lower than those on the regular long-distance network. 
 Extending such service south of the border could be a boon for business callers, because telephoning is notoriously frustrating in Mexico City and other large urban areas in Mexico. Only about one of two phone calls within the country is completed, and success in international calling is even more random.
The recently privatized Mexican phone company, Telefonos de Mexico, says it expects to sign within a week or so agreements with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the MCI Communications Corporation and the Sprint Corporation for establishing virtual private networks that would very likely allow businesses to connect multiple sites in Mexico as well as the United States.
The agreements will cover technical standards and the fees that carriers will pay each other for passing calls between their networks.
Telmex, as the Mexican phone company is known, said it had already signed Aereoboutique, a Mexican chain of duty-free shops at airports, to test such a network.
Hector Carlos, marketing vice president for Telmex in Mexico City, said the company was moving quickly to make life easier for corporate customers. In 1980, 10 percent of its long-distance market was international, he said. In 1990, it was 20 percent, and this year, it will be 23 percent, or some 1.5 billion minutes. That is the equivalent of more than 2,850 years of lucrative telephone talk, mostly to the United States. "So we are very interested in improving this market," Mr. Carlos said.
Virtual private networks are the successors to the private networks that beginning in the 1960's became the province of large corporations with the wealth to afford them and enough branch offices to provide sufficient calling volume. Without such critical mass, private networks do not warrant the expense of leasing dedicated telephone circuits from the phone company and devoting management resources to their design and supervision.
The large volume of calls that makes a private network feasible can lead to cost savings. Among other advantages -- and the one most noticeable to users -- is abbreviated dialing. Instead of dialing 10 numbers on a long-distance call, for example, a user can dial one digit -- say, an "8" -- wait for a dial tone, then dial four or five more digits. A high-speed computer, searching through a data base of telephone numbers and their shorter counterparts, might recognize that 8-1234 represents a company's Los Angeles office, whose phone number is actually 213-555-1234.
Virtual private networks, available in the United States for the last seven years or so, offer many of the same advantages, but at lower cost and with little of the technical and maintenance problems of a private network. (Still, anyone with a phone bill less than $50,000 a month might not find the service economical.) Through high-speed computers and sophisticated data bases, telephone companies can create the illusion of a private network, using their regular public-network equipment.
The market for such virtual private networks is already huge. The Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston, estimates that 1992 revenue to carriers like Sprint, A.T.& T. and MCI will total $2.86 billion for virtual network services. Next year's projection: $3.9 billion.
To date, nearly all of the market is within the United States and the revenue has come from voice communications. But companies like General Electric, Olin, United Technologies and Xerox are using such networks for both voice and data communications, which can send electronic mail and computer-generated blueprints quickly across the country.
The Gartner Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn., expects an explosion in foreign business. By 1996, the firm sees a $12.5 billion market for voice and data, with about 30 percent of revenue generated abroad, especially in Mexico and Canada.
Using the regular public telephone network, a business call from New York to Mexico City goes from the office's phone to a New York Telephone public line to a long-distance carrier like Sprint. Sprint then carries the call across the country and across the Mexican border to a Telmex public line in Mexico City. The telephone companies' central-office switches along the way find available circuits and route the call.
By contrast, the traditional type of private networks employs dedicated circuits -- sophisticated versions of a string running between two tin cans (but with lots of strings and numerous pairs of cans). The number of strings in a private network increases exponentially, so that 10 offices in a private network require 45 telephone lines; 50 offices need 1,225 lines and 100 offices take 4,950 lines.
 
Disadvantage of a Flat Rate
 Such complexity requires a great deal of equipment and a large telecommunications staff for maintenance and repair. And companies pay the same flat rate for each line -- whether they use it 24 hours a day or only a minute a day.
As computers became cheaper and more efficient, and the software more supple and nimble, the telephone companies realized they could offer customers the advantages of a private network, including price, without the profit-killing labor costs of caring and feeding such networks.
They could also charge by volume, albeit at an attractive price, rather than at a flat rate, making more efficient use of the public network that the telephone companies had spent billions of dollars to build.
 
Cutting Down on Dialing
 In a virtual private network, a company employee can still enjoy abbreviated dialing. But instead of the call going over lines the company has leased purely for its use, the call goes mainly over public lines, guided by sophisticated computers.
In Mexico, providing virtual private networks will be a little more complicated. For such networks to perform properly, Mexico must improve its creaky telephone system, a task Telmex has pledged to do in a series of huge modernization programs. An $8 billion project that comes to a close next year involves, among other things, installing modern telephone switching computers in some 2,000 central offices serving 10,000 cities and towns.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Assessing the Network Choices"
 
The Public Switched Network
 
Advantages: Calls can be placed to any other phone on the public network; customer has little equipment to maintain.
 
Disadvantages: Can be expensive if many calls are made each day; no guaranteed access to an open line during peak periods.
 
A Private Network
 
Advantages: Guaranteed access to an open line at all times; lower prices based ona flat rate, rather tha a charge for each call; abbreviated dialing.
 
Disadvantages: Same flat rate, even if network is not used full time; labor intensive for repairs and maintenance.
 
A Virtual Private Network
 
Advantages: Guaranteed access; discounts based on calling volume; lower maintenance costs than a private network.
 
Disadvantages: Costly for smaller businesses with low calling volume.

HEADLINE: THE PURPOSEFUL COOK;
For a Simple End to Summer, It's Fish the Light Basque Way

BYLINE: By JACQUES PEPIN

 BODY:
IN this simple, light menu still suggestive of summer, whiting is featured in a main dish inspired by the cooking of the Basques, the people of northern Spain and southwest France. Whiting, or merluza, as the Basques call it, is plentiful and inexpensive in that region and in most parts of the United States. If you can't find it, substitute another economical species -- perhaps porgy or bluefish, providing it is fresh.
I prepare the fish in the Basque style, en cazuela. The term refers specifically to a type of earthenware cooking pot common to that region, but it is also used in a broader context to describe the airtight, moist cooking, or braising, that is done in these and similar pots and that is a speciality there. 
 I achieve the same results with a Dutch oven, and cook my dish a l'etouffee, or "smothered," with the fish and accompanying vegetables cooked in a tightly covered casserole with very little fat or liquid. Potatoes are cooked on their own for a while, and beans are added and cooked until they are very tender. This is not a dish in which the vegetables end up crunchy. It is more like a satisfying and flavorful stew.
We begin the menu with a salad of iceberg lettuce, tomato and blue cheese. Even though fancy restaurants turn up their noses at iceberg lettuce, it is still an occasional favorite at our house. We especially like it cut into large wedges, as it is here, and served cold with tomatoes -- still good and inexpensive -- with blue cheese crumbled on top.
You can use almost any good-quality blue cheese, ranging from more expensive imported varieties to domestic specimens. A mozzarella would also be quite good with this type of vinaigrette, if blue cheese is not appealing. This is a great starter salad, especially on a hot September night, with crusty bread. The crunchiness of the iceberg lettuce goes well with flavorful tomatoes and the accented taste of the blue cheese and dressing.
We finish this meal with a simple but elegant mango and cognac dessert that is a sure winner, but only if it is made with a ripe mango. Mangoes are available year-round but are a little less expensive at summer's end. With a bit of cognac, pear brandy, rum or even whisky to flavor this concoction, it makes a great finish to this early-fall menu.
With this meal, I would suggest an Alsace pinot blanc, many of which are inexpensive. Albert Seltz, for example, is a creamy, soft, fruity wine from that region that is attractively priced.
 
Spread Thin
 If you have any of the mango dessert left over, puree it in a food processor and use it as a jam on toast for breakfast the following morning.
 
Iceberg and Blue-Cheese Salad
Total time: 10 minutes
 
1 tight head iceberg lettuce (about 1 1/4 pounds)
3 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/4 pounds)
1 4 1/2-ounce piece blue cheese (Danish, Stilton, Gorgonzola or Roquefort)
1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
 3/4 teaspoon salt
 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar
6 tablespoons canola or corn oil.
1. Discard any damaged outer leaves from the head of lettuce and cut it into 6 wedges. Core the tomatoes and cut each into six wedges.
2. Arrange a wedge of lettuce and three wedges of tomato on each of six salad plates. Crumble the cheese and sprinkle it over the lettuce and tomatoes on each plate.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sending Officials to Balkans as Monitors

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The United States is sending a small contingent of officials to the Balkans to take part in international efforts to end the Yugoslav conflict under an agreement worked out at a peace conference last month in London.
The dozen or so officials, who will stay outside the war zones, represent the first involvement of United States personnel other than diplomats since the fighting in the Balkans broke out in late June 1991. 
 The main United States effort is in tightening economic sanctions on Yugoslavia, especially Serbia, which is the dominant component of the truncated nation and is perceived as the principal instigator of the fighting. A senior Administration official said the sanctions, imposed by the United Nations in June and endorsed by the conference in London, had stopped about 80 percent of Serbia's imports.
The official said that in an effort to increase this percentage, nine specialists in border traffic, including members of the United States Customs Service, would be sent to Romania and Hungary next week to assist in intercepting Serbia's imports, particularly oil, which is being smuggled by barge up the Danube to refineries in Serbia.
In line with the London conference's call for protection of minorities in the region, two United States officials are to join international monitors in areas of Serbia with large minorities. These are Kosovo, the home of 1.7 million ethnic Albanians; Vojvodina, with 350,000 ethnic Hungarians and various other minorities, and the Sanjak, a region with more than 200,000 Muslims.
Their task, the official said, will be to evaluate the threat posed by the Serbian nationalists in power in Belgrade and to report on attempts to drive the minority populations out of Serbia.
In addition, the Administration has stationed an official in Macedonia, the southernmost former Yugoslav republic, to report on threats to its sovereignty. He is Robert Frowick, a retired ambassador with considerable experience in Eastern Europe; he arrived last week in Skopje, the capital.
Warren Zimmermann, the last United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia, is to coordinate Washington's involvement in the Balkans.
On leave from his new post as director of refugee programs at the State Department, Mr. Zimmermann is also Washington's representative on the 22-nation steering committee set up to implement the decisions taken in London. The committee, based in Geneva, is led by Cyrus R. Vance, a former Secretary of State, representing the United Nations, and Lord Owen, a former British Foreign Secretary, representing the European Community.
A senior Administration official said stronger enforcement of sanctions is intended to increase pressure on the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic. The official said the Administration hoped this pressure would generate support for Milan Panic, a Serbian-born American businessman and opponent of Mr. Milosevic's policies who was named Prime Minister of Yugoslavia in July.
Some Administration officials had dismissed Mr. Panic as a puppet of Mr. Milosevic. Now, they note with satisfaction that Mr. Panic has beaten back an effort by Milosevic supporters to oust him, has dismissed the chief of Mr. Milosevic's secret police and has forced the resignation of Vladislav Jovanovic, the Foreign Minister forced upon him by the Milosevic camp.

HEADLINE: Crisis Is Seen for Sub-Saharan Africa

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
As the world grapples with starvation in Somalia, American and international aid officials say they are looking ahead to a crisis many times larger building across sub-Saharan Africa, where drought and civil war may put millions more at risk over the next few months.
"Something like 110 million people live in the countries affected by the drought," said Andrew Natsios, Assistant Administrator for Food and Humanitarian Assistance at the United States Agency for International Development. 
 "The U.N. estimates that 30 million of them will suffer in some way -- 18 million are at risk and could die if we don't intervene," Mr. Natsios, who is also President Bush's coordinator for relief in Somalia, said in an interview today. "The people most at risk are in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Angola and Swaziland."
Mr. Natsios said that the United States prepared an action plan for the region in March, and has committed nearly 2 million tons of food for the southern drought region.
Many experts still believe that a greater national and international committment is needed. Private donations are running far below expectations and aid experts expect to face enormous logistical problems delivering aid to half a dozen or more countries.
"Internationally, there is no mobilization," said Jeffrey Clark, a consultant on relief assistance in Africa at the U.S. Committee for Refugees. "There is no master plan. There is nobody saying, 'Somalia cannot be repeated in Mozambique or southern Sudan.' There is nobody saying, 'We have to raise a billion dollars and get food on the boats and get going.' "
An Administration official said today: "Southern Africa has fallen off the scope publicly. But we are starting to face the crunch there. We are beginning to hear about starvation in Mozambique."
In Mozambique, a regional shortage of food is being worsened, as in Somalia, by the refusal of armed rebels to honor agreements to distribute aid.
 
Century's Worst Drought
 Today, the Agriculture Department said that $33.6 million in surplus corn would be donated to African relief. The Agriculture Department said priority would be given to Somalia, Kenya and other countries in Africa where civil strife, drought and the resulting needs of refugees have put a severe strain on local food supplies.
Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Angola, Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa are all suffering from what experts are calling the worst drought in a century in southern Africa. Millions of animals are dying. At least 2 million people have become refugees in search of food.
For the countries of southern Africa, the tragedy is compounded by the threat of long-term damage to political and economic development in the region with the brightest hopes on the continent, said Alison Rosenberg, Assistant Administrator for Africa at the United States Agency for International Development.
"Here we have all that is good about Africa in its prospects for democracy and economic growth colliding with a disaster not of their own making," she said. "It is setting back what they all had worked hard to achieve."
A drought has also affected Kenya, where may thousands of Somalis have taken refuge.
 
Donations Plummet
 On the west coast, Liberia is facing famine born of a simmering civil war. In Zaire, local commerce is collapsing along with the currency as the country struggles to emerge from three decades of rule by Mobutu Sese Seko.
In the face of a continent-wide crisis, leaders of relief organizations and some Administration officials who work day-to-day on relief say that donations to African causes have plummeted since the Ethiopian crisis of the mid 1980's.
"Only three percent of the public contributions donated for relief efforts in Africa in 1984-1985 have been raised for this humanitarian crisis," Tom Getman, director of government relations for World Vision, a private development organization, told a news conference here this week. "Private voluntary organizations face serious financial shortfalls."
Mr. Clark, a former staff member of the House Select Committee on Hunger and director of Project Africa at the Carter Center in Atlanta, was sharply critical in an interview of top officials of Bush Administration, whom he accused of using the Somalia crisis for political ends, and of the United Nations, whose response to the growing crisis in Africa he called "hapless, hopeless and criminally negligent."
 
U.N. Effort Criticized
 "The U.N. ought to be held publicly accountable for their failure to galvanize their own agencies, let alone the public," he said in an interview.
Private groups also say the public should not be dissuaded from making donations by reports of difficulties in delivering aid.
"Despite the barriers in Somalia -- the violence, the looting, the wackos with guns out there -- the cause is not totally hopeless, and some good is being done," Mr. Clark said. "People can indeed make a contribution to a private relief group and have confidence that some children will be reached.
Officials at the Agency for International Development say that they have been tracking the situation in southern Africa since early this year when spring rains did not come, destroying a season of crops and depriving grazing animals of food.
A senior Administration official said that although an international donors' conference in the summer drew pledges of support for southern Africa, a transportation system into vast areas of the interior of the continent will have to be arranged.

GOV. BILL CLINTON
In a speech at the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center in South-Central Los Angeles yesterday
" Unless we have a growing economy, making capital available to business, and educating and training workers will still not create the jobs. We've tried trickle-down for 12 years. I want you to give Al Gore and Bill Clinton a chance to invest, to educate, to cooperate and to compete. We're going to create millions of new jobs in America, and opportunities, so that people we educate and train, people we give the capacity to go into business, can make a living and bring this economy back.
Don't you know we could diminish the racial tensions in this community, don't you know we could diminish the tensions between rich and poor in this community, if everybody thought that if they worked hard and played the rules they could get ahead? 
 I'm tired of seeing people who do this ground down. And I want them to be lifted up.
I ask you now, if you want the backlog ended in institutions like this and everybody who's lined up for these education services get them, if you want to see loans being made to people in your neighborhood, if you want to see businesses starting up again, if you want to see the economy going again, if you want to see us creating jobs in the private sector and not just in the government again, vote for Bill Clinton and Al Gore in 48 days and we'll revitalize this community and all the communities like it.

Europe's Turmoil May Aid the U.S.

 BODY:
The turmoil in Europe's financial markets is primarily a European affair and the United States will not get involved, officials of the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve said yesterday. In fact, the turbulence could help the American economy, they said, by lowering interest rates and spurring growth in Europe and the United States. Beyond that, Europe's trauma has given the Fed more flexibility to lower interest rates because it has strengthened the dollar, they said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
Secrecy Over TV Ads, or, the Peculiar Logic of Political Combat

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton put a new commercial on the air last week, hoping it will be seen by millions of people somewhere in America. But the Clinton campaign will not say where.
President Bush, too, is preparing advertisements that could go on television any day now in crucial states. But even after the commercials go on, the Bush campaign will not be telling in which states. 
 With seven weeks to go before the election, the media campaign has entered its cloak-and-dagger phase.
Though there is no campaign tactic more public than advertising, no information is more closely guarded than what the candidates plan to put on television, and where. This is because at this stage of the race, every advertising dollar spent represents a clue to a campaign's deepest hopes and a potential revelation about its priorities.
 
Political Triage
 "Analyzing the media buy is some of the most important strategic information you can get," said Tad Devine, a top aide to Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas in his 1988 Vice-Presidential campaign. "When you go in and you plunk that money down, you say, 'This is our strategy for winning the Electoral College.' "
Like triage, every Presidential advertising strategy involves a set of grim decisions: this state can be saved, this one cannot. But it is triage with a twist. Each candidate wants to use his own resources most efficiently while at the same time forcing his opponent to squander his.
Such complex calculations can lead to peculiar results, like candidates' broadcasting commercials in states they have no hope of winning. "If you're going to write off a state but you know that your opponent needs to win that state, you still might put up an attack to get them to waste resources," one Bush campaign aide explained.
 
Spend Here, Lose There?
 In this world of feint and counterfeint, the more expensive a state's media markets are, the more likely that state is to be used for campaign sabotage. The Bush team, for example, is worried that the Clinton campaign will go on television in Texas, a state with several high-priced markets that falls into the "must win" category for the President.
A few well-timed attacks could be a sign that the Clinton camp really believes it can win Texas, or just a ploy to get the President to spend money in the state he calls home.
"That would be a big deal if you make Bush spend a couple of million dollars in Texas, because it might mean you win Michigan," Hank Morris, a Democratic consultant, said.
The Clinton team, meanwhile, has similar fears about California. Earlier this summer the President's aides put out the word that they were considering an advertising push in California, a push that so far has not occurred.
Most analysts say that at this point the President has little hope of winning California; still, a Bush campaign advertising blitz there could throw the Clinton campaign's plans into disarray, forcing it to take money that had been earmarked for the Midwest and spend it in the expensive West Coast.
 
Daily Calculations
 At this point, neither side has arrived at its final strategy; calculations are fluctuating not only in response to the opposition but also in response to new data. Almost every day, top staff members for the Bush and Clinton campaigns receive updated lists of states that are not yet in their column but could be.
At the same time, battles are still being waged within each campaign over advertising tactics. At Bush headquarters, the fight is between those aides who believe the campaign should tailor different advertising messages to different media markets and those who believe it should spend most of its money sending out a unified message on network television. (On Sunday, the campaign began an advertising campaign on the networks, broadcasting a 60-second commercial on the President's economic plans.)
 
Positive and Negative
 Within the Clinton camp, the debate centers on whether to continue to run positive ads, like the one it put on the air yesterday on Mr. Clinton's economic plan, or to switch to more negative ones that focus on President Bush's record. Mr. Clinton himself was reported last week to be favoring the latter approach but was talked out of it, at least temporarily. (Anticipating attacks from the Bush campaign on the Governor's own record, Mr. Clinton's media team has already prepared a series of response ads.)
Since time is of the essence, both campaigns are happy merely to keep their opponents guessing for a few extra days, or even hours. Once a commercial goes on the air it is, of course, public, but even before that a campaign's plans can fall into enemy hands: when a candidate for public office buys advertising time, television stations are required to make this information available to anyone who requests it.
What keeps the spy-vs.-spy game going is the fact that the information is not available in a centralized location. To keep tabs on the other side, the campaigns have to rely on word of mouth from their media buyers or else employ legions of volunteers to check the records of the television stations in every media market in the country.
Last week, when the Clinton campaign put a new commercial about welfare on the air, the Governor's aides assumed that the Bush campaign would know within a few days where it was showing. (Among the states where it was broadcast, according to one Bush aide, are North Carolina and Georgia.) But the campaign was not about to give information it could make its opponent work for.
As Mr. Clinton's media adviser, Mandy Grunwald, put it, "Why make it easy for them?"

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview;
Bush and Clinton Lob Economic Plans

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The Presidential race moved into a transcontinental bidding war on the economy and compassion today as President Bush offered a $500 million tax credit to companies that provide family emergency leaves and Gov. Bill Clinton outlined a $1.5 billion program to revive the inner cities.
Campaigning at opposite ends of the country -- Mr. Bush in the Oval Office and Mr. Clinton in Los Angeles -- both candidates tried to focus attention on their economic proposals. 
 Trying to move beyond questions about his draft status in the Vietnam War, Mr. Clinton traveled to the precincts of Los Angeles that were shattered by rioting last spring and sought to put flesh on the economic proposals he has outlined in recent months in vague terms.
 
Subsidized Savings Accounts
 The Democratic Presidential nominee offered a plan to "move people from welfare to payrolls to businesses," which would include the creation of banks to stimulate investment in urban areas and federally subsidized savings accounts for the urban and rural poor. Mr. Clinton backed up his appeal with a new television commercial that showed him sitting on his desk with an American flag behind him, declaring that "government just isn't working for the hard-working families of America."
Mr. Bush, taking a day off from the stump, remained in Washington, where he put the final touches on what aides said would be a "major economic speech" that he would make on Thursday. His aim, they said, is to draw a point-by-point contrast between his ideas and Mr. Clinton's.
Pursuing the White House's effort to undermine public trust in his opponent, the President "will point out the economic consequences if you follow the Clinton plan -- higher taxes, re-regulation among them -- and make the case that Americans can't afford to take those risks," said Judy Smith, deputy White House press secretary.
This morning Mr. Bush called Republican lawmakers to the White House to provide a forum for announcing his own family leave plan -- to give companies with fewer than 500 employees a tax credit of up to $1,200 if they give their workers leave for personal and family emergencies.
 
No Expectation of Passage
 Mr. Bush called on Congress to take up his bill immediately. But White House officials acknowledged that the President was sending the measure to Capitol Hill at this late date with no expectation that it would get any real consideration, much less actual passage, before Election Day.
The bill, which the White House was still drafting as Mr. Bush announced it at the hastily scheduled meeting with the Republican lawmakers, was primarily intended to give the President political cover if he carried out his threat to veto another family leave measure that was passed by Congress last week and would require companies to give their workers unpaid emergency leaves.
Clearly vexed at being cornered on such a politically popular issue as family leave so close to the election, Mr. Bush complained testily about the timing of the family-leave bill that was sent to him by Congress, calling it "very peculiar and highly political."
The Congressional bill would require businesses with more than 50 employees to provide unpaid leave in family emergencies. The President has threatened to veto it, and he accused Congress today of trying to force him into a politically embarrassing position by sending him the bill so close to the election.
But the White House seemed hard pressed to explain why Mr. Bush was sending up his own bill now. The President vetoed a family leave measure in 1990, saying he opposed the idea of requiring businesses to provide leaves, but he did not offer any alternative bill.
Mr. Bush's proposal would cost $400 million to $500 million, the White House said, promising to offer cuts in other programs to avoid increasing the Federal budget deficit.
It would provide credits of up to $20 a day for as many as 60 days of leave in any 12-month period, or a maximum of $1,200 per employee, and would cover companies with fewer than 500 workers, the White House said.
Mr. Clinton wasted no time attacking the Bush proposal. He called it part of the President's "continuing pander parade" and said the President "has no idea how he'll pay for it."
Mr. Clinton, who was called the "pander bear" by former Senator Paul E. Tsongas in the Democratic primaries, also has done little to explain how he would pay for his own ambitious economic plans.
Speaking at a job-training center in South-Central Los Angeles to a mostly black and Hispanic audience of about 1,000, Mr. Clinton promised a series of programs that his issues director, Bruce Reed, said would cost $1.5 billion a year. They include these steps:
*Adding 95 federally supported "community development banks" to the five that now exist in poor rural and urban areas, at a cost of $150 million a year for four years.
*Establishing 1,000 "micro-enterprise programs," which are smaller versions of the community banks where poor people could get loans of $500 or $1,000. The cost: $50 million.
*Creating "individual development accounts" at a cost of $100 million a year for five years. Families with incomes of up to $28,000 a year for a family of four would be allowed to deposit up to $1,800 a year in an account earmarked for education, job training or starting a small business; the Federal Government would match their savings.
*Creating 75 to 125 enterprise zones in urban areas.
There are significant points of convergence between Mr. Clinton's plan and the ideas that Mr. Bush put forward after the Los Angeles riots. Enterprise zones, through which businesses would receive tax breaks and other incentives to locate in blighted neighborhoods, are central to Mr. Bush's economic policy.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail;
2 Champs, Bush's Man and Quayle's Man, Quietly Slug It Out

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

 BODY:
Nothing brings on power plays at the White House like an election year. The latest word out of the East Wing is that one of the smartest political in-fighters anywhere, James A. Baker 3d, the President's chief of staff, is trying to keep another world-class infighter, William Kristol, the Vice President's chief of staff, out of the decision-making loop.
But before the main event, some perspective: 
 These two men have more in common than brains and titles: They are wily, charming, ambitious and promoters without peer.
So what's the problem?
Neither man is talking, but according to some Administration officials, Mr. Baker does not like all the good ink and air time that Mr. Kristol has recently been getting, portraying himself, or being portrayed, as the brains and power behind the new, improved Dan Quayle. Mr. Baker is no Quayle fan, but he is said to believe that it is unconscionable that Mr. Kristol is promoting himself and overshadowing his boss at this crucial political juncture.
So much for Answer No. 1.
Answer No. 2, from other Administration sources, goes like this:
It takes one to know one.
 
A Plane, for Sure, But the Meaning?

Whether a campaign is gaining momentum can be measured in any number of ways, all inexact.
For years the addition of a second plane to a campaign entourage for a swollen press contingent has been taken as a solid sign of political progress.
This week, the Clinton campaign added a second plane.
Momentum?
Maybe. Maybe not.
In years past, a campaign that was rolling well would have added a second plane weeks ago. On the other hand, this is not a typical year. News organizations have been hit hard by the recession, and not in recent memory have there been so few reporters out on the trail.
 
Kernels of Truth From Campaign Life

By his own admission, Gov. Bill Clinton has been running for office most of his life, whether for class president or President of the United States. So it would follow that he has accumulated a lot of wisdom about politicking and has concluded that there are certain political verities.
Late the other night, as he winged wearily toward still another campaign appearance, he stopped looking ahead for a moment and turned reflective.
Herewith, verbatim, Bill Clinton's "Laws of Politics:"
1) Always be introduced by someone you've appointed to high office.
2) When you're starting to have a good time, you're supposed to be someplace else.
3) There is no such thing as enough money.
4) If someone tells you it's not a money problem, it's someone else's problem.
5) When someone tells you it's not personal, they're fixing to stick it to you.
6) Nearly everyone will lie to you given the right circumstances.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN EUROPE;
The High Cost of Unity

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The currency systems of Western Europe were thrown into disarray today when speculators took hold of exchange markets. They sold weaker currencies like the British pound, the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta, and bought the strongest currency in Europe, the German mark.
But more fundamentally, the chaos occurred because of an underlying crisis afflicting the economies of Europe. The crisis is rooted in the high cost of German unification, which is driving up German interest rates at a time when other European countries need lower rates to help them out of their economic slowdown. 
 The immediate spur of the buying and selling by currency speculators over the last 10 days was a growing fear that France will vote on Sunday to reject the Maastricht treaty on European union -- in the process sinking the European Community's plan to create a single currency by the end of the decade.
Many currency traders believe that a French "no" in the referendum would put on hold plans for a single European currency and disrupt the community's system of linked exchange rates.
 
Winners and Losers
 Their concern was that in this disruption, Britain and other countries with weak currencies would be forced to devalue, letting the worth of their money drop even further in relation to the German mark. By rushing to buy marks, the speculators thus engaged in self-fulfilling prophecy.
The Italian lira was the first to give way when the lira was devalued by 7 percent on Sunday. Today, Britain was forced to cut loose the pound from the fixed values of other European currencies, allowing it to "float" and effectively devaluing it. And the peseta also came under market pressure.
Currency devaluations are anything but an academic exercise in Europe. The value of money is a much greater political issue than, for example, in the United States because European consumers depend so heavily on imports. A devaluation raises the price of foreign goods, bringing higher living costs and inflation.
Currency gyrations may slow in coming days once the French referendum on the European treaty is decided and some of the current uncertainty is eliminated. But the underlying forces in the current crisis, the high cost of German unification and the European-wide economic slowdown, will not disappear even if French voters approve the treaty.
This slide into recession follows a burst of rapid growth in the late 1980's. Through much of Europe, unemployment is on the rise, investment is down and business confidence has evaporated.
French approval of the European union treaty would therefore give the community a much-needed psychological lift by preserving the principal blueprint for the future, including the goal of a single currency by 1999. But it would not mean that the 12 nations in the community had turned the corner economically or were secure from new currency crises.
[The European Community's monetary committee decided in Brussels early Thursday that further steps were necessary, It voted to let Italy set the lira free from the exchange-rate system and to allow Spain to devalue the peseta by 5 percent.]
In recent months, most European economies have become hostage to the unexpectedly high cost of German unification. Germany has long had the region's strongest economy and currency and, in the 1980's at least, its monetary discipline proved to be a stabilizing influence.
But it has become clear that the financial burden of trying to develop the former East Germany is much greater than many Germans and other Europeans had expected. By some accounts, the cost could be $100 billion in the next few years.
 
Enforcing Frugality
 This burden has spawned new inflation in Germany. To fight this, the German central bank, the Bundesbank, has raised domestic interest rates as a way of persuading people to save rather than spend -- the theory being that, with less money circulating, inflation will come down.
The Germans have also had to raise interest rates to attract the large amounts of money needed to carry out the reconstruction of the east without raising taxes.
Adopted for purely German reasons, this policy was bound to have an impact on Western Europe's interdependent economies. And as German interest rates went up, foreign investors abandoned currencies that offered less attractive returns and rushed to buy marks to take advantage of these higher rates.
Under free-market conditions, the mark's value would normally increase until investors considered it too expensive to buy. And this is what has hurt the dollar: Its value against the mark has tumbled in recent weeks, not least because interest rates are so much lower in the United States than in Germany.
Within Europe, the situation is more complicated since the major currencies are linked. Under this system, they can fluctuate only within narrow margins of their basic value, as expressed in European Currency Units, or ECU's. The value of the ECU against, say, the dollar reflects the weighted values of all the European currencies.
As a result, as German interest rates began drawing investors and pushing up the mark's value, other community governments had to bolster their own currencies to keep them within the permitted margins of the so-called exchange rate mechanism. And they had to do this by raising their own interest rates to make them competitive.
In other words, community members found themselves importing Germany's economic problems. For example, although French inflation is low, high interest rates began driving the French economy into a slump. And Britain, which had succeeded in lowering inflation, found that its high interest rates stood in the way of a resumption of economic growth. Italy was particularly vulnerable because of a huge budget deficit.
Part of the deal was that Germany would take the pressure off the other currencies by lowering its rates. But when the Bundesbank reduced key rates by only 0.25 percent on Monday, foreign-exchange markets concluded that it was not sufficient, and the attack on the pound stepped up.
Today, announcing Britain's temporary withdrawal from the community's linked currency system, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, pointed his finger at the culprits. "As a result of uncertainties caused by the French referendum," he said, "massive speculative flow have continued to disrupt the functioning of the exchange-rate mechanism."
After the Bank of England had raised interest rates by five percentage points in two stages earlier in the day to sustain the pound, speculators no longer believed that the British currency could avoid devaluation.
With the shadow of the French referendum hanging over the community, exchange markets are certain to remain unstable.
It is not clear whether today's sterling crisis will have any effect on the result of the French vote. After German interest rates were slightly lowered on Monday, Finance Minister Michel Sapin held out the carrot of lower French interest rates -- if voters say yes on Sunday.
Supporters of the European union treaty have insisted that the current crisis is itself proof of the need for a single currency, arguing that without competing currencies, community governments would not have to engage in interest-rate wars.
France also sees a single currency managed by a regional central bank as the best way of breaking the Germans' grip on its monetary policy. In other words, as only one of several countries represented in a regional central bank, Germany would presumably be unable to impose its will on the community.
For this very reason, many senior Bundesbank officials are less than enthusiastic about a single currency. And if France approves the union treaty, German concern about "losing" the mark seems certain to surface when the treaty comes up for ratification in Parliament this fall.
If France rejects the treaty, however, most financial experts anticipate a new wave of currency speculation, perhaps against the French franc, as well. And in that case, the only way of restoring market stability could be to carry out a broader realignment of currencies within the exchange-rate mechanism -- something European governments are eager to avoid.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Senate;
PRIMARY IN HAND, ABRAMS SETS OUT TO OUST D'AMATO

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The general-election campaign for the Senate from New York began in earnest yesterday as the Democratic nominee, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, squared off for a bruising battle against the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Mr. Abrams claimed victory after defeating former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro by 11,000 votes, or 1 percentage point, in unofficial returns. Ms. Ferraro made no public concession, but her aides acknowledged privately that she had lost and that she supported the nominee. 
 Mr. Abrams used the morning after his victory to stump at a subway stop on the Upper West Side of Manhattan at breakfast time, where he called Mr. D'Amato "one of the roughest, toughest customers ever to come down the political pike." Mr. D'Amato repaid the compliment by beginning to broadcast television commercials deriding Mr. Abrams as "hopelessly liberal" on taxing and spending.
 
2 Landmarks Bruised
 The primary drew just under 30 percent of the state's registered Democrats to the polls -- half again as many as forecast by some experts -- after an extraordinarily rancorous campaign. It left two landmarks on New York's political landscape -- Ms. Ferraro and one of her opponents, Elizabeth Holtzman -- badly bruised and pondering their futures after what many feminists had hoped would be a year of triumph for women turned instead into a harsh and unforgiving fight between them. [Page B5.]
With 99 percent of election districts reporting, this was the tally:
 
Robert Abrams . . . 411,072 (37%)
Geraldine A. Ferraro . . . 400,084 (36%)
Al Sharpton . . . 161,691 (15%)
Elizabeth Holtzman . . . 140,884 (13%)
Absentee and paper ballots will not be counted for at least several days and the final returns will not be certified until Sept. 30. A spokesman for the State Board of Elections, David Flanagan, said a spot check with county boards around the state showed 16,778 uncounted absentee ballots yesterday, with more to filter in before the deadline next Tuesday. But election-law experts agreed that it appeared impossible that Ms. Ferraro, who in 1984 was the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, could win enough votes to reverse the outcome.
After a brief morning meeting with her campaign staff, Ms . Ferraro retreated to her home in Queens. "We're not saying anything," said her press secretary, Frank Wilkinson. "We're not doing anything. We're just sitting tight."
While the election was a blow to Ms. Ferraro, it propelled the Rev. Al Sharpton to new prominence. The often flamboyant leader of civil rights protests was making his first run for political office and outpolled Ms. Holtzman to win third place. He won the support of two-thirds of black voters, whose help Mr. Abrams will need in November.
 
An Awkward Position
 That puts the Attorney General in the awkward position of courting the help of a man being prosecuted by his office on income-tax evasion charges in a trial scheduled for January. Mr. Sharpton said the two of them would talk, and Mr. Abrams said he wanted the help of all his old rivals, but both men said they would keep the two issues separate.
"It would be asking him to lose the election," Mr. Sharpton said, referring to any possibility that Mr. Abrams might drop the prosecution. "I would be more concerned if he was going to represent the interests that would help my community."
It was the looming fight between Mr. Abrams and Mr. D'Amato, a two-term incumbent who has withstood official inquiries into his ethical conduct in office and styled himself as a fearless crusader for the common man, that dominated the political discussion yesterday. And in that fight, Ms. Ferraro's silence -- however temporary -- did not help Mr. Abrams on the morning after an election in which she drew the votes of 4 in 10 women while he drew support of 3 in 10.
In addition to accusing Mr. Abrams of supporting tax increases on the middle class to finance a national health insurance program -- which the Attorney General denies -- Mr. D'Amato is using two other television commercials that feature a 10-second pitch from one of the state's most prominent Democrats, former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who smiles into the camera and says: "Two years ago, you didn't re-elect me. Don't make the same mistake twice. Re-elect Al D'Amato for the Senate."
 
Party Loyalty
 As Mayor, Mr. Koch was friendly with Mr. D'Amato but said the constraints of party loyalty prevented him from taking sides. Earlier this year, he said he no longer faced such strictures and endorsed him. Yesterday, Mr. Koch said he had agreed to make the commercials because "Bob Abrams has the political courage of a gnat."
Mr. Koch faulted Mr. Abrams for refusing to say flatly until the Persian Gulf war was over whether he would have favored the use of military force as a member of Congress. Eventually, Mr. Abrams said that "with hindsight," force was necessary.
"He did that because he knows that his support is the radical left in the Democratic Party, and they dominate the primary, and he didn't want to alienate them," Mr. Koch said. "I'm not opposed to the radical left being part of the Democratic Party, but I'm not part of them. They don't vote for me and I don't support them."
In fact, Mr. Abrams ran in the primary as an unabashed liberal, seeking to point out his differences with Ms. Ferraro over the death penalty, cuts in military spending and a national health insurance plan, to be financed by a new payroll tax on employers, which he says would replace the cost of the private insurance coverage they now bear. But in a televised debate among the four candidates, Mr. Abrams was also careful to avoid supporting any tax increase for individuals.
Even before he won the Democratic Senate nomination, Mr. Abrams held the nomination of the Liberal Party, without whose support no Democrat has won statewide office in the half-century since its founding. But the party's leader, Raymond B. Harding, said yesterday that "I think Bob knows what balance he has to strike."
Mr. Harding said Mr. Abrams should "position himself in terms of a Clinton-Gore situation, in a dynamic at work where if you link Bush and Quayle and D'Amato, there'll be a synergy that'll damage the other side."
 
'Family Values'
 By contrast, with the national Democratic ticket running strongly in New York, Mr. D'Amato will probably have to outpace President Bush and draw the crossover conservative Democrats who have backed him in the past, in order to win. He has already moved to distance himself from the President, criticizing his economic advisers and saying the emphasis on "family values" at the Republican National Convention was misplaced.
"It's going to be an interesting election," said the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers. "I think people will make a choice between somebody who has been in Washington and done the job for them, and somebody who has sat in Albany and enforced the law."
He added: "I think Al's principles are well known to people. They know what he is."
Mr. D'Amato begins the race with a war chest of $3.7 million, about five times the amount Mr. Abrams has on hand. The Senator's aides said he planned to spend about $700,000 on his television advertising campaign alone.
 
Rechecking of Tallies
 While the Democratic primary was unsually close, election experts said yesterday that it was virtually certain the results would stand. Inspectors will now conduct a routine "recanvass," required by law, in which the tallies on sealed voting machines are checked against the written records of election workers for any discrepancies.
Local election boards will also count absentee ballots and the paper ballots of voters whose registration cards were not on file at polling places on Tuesday, and they must forward those tallies to Albany for official certification by the end of the month.
But absentee ballots historically reflect the general trend at the polls, election lawyers said. After factoring out the votes likely to go to Ms. Holtzman and Mr. Sharpton, Ms. Ferraro would need roughly two-thirds of the remainder to have even a chance of beating Mr. Abrams -- in other words, a lead far greater than the one that separated them in either the actual results or polling in the days before the election.

Agility Counts in Currency Chaos

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The world's currency markets, it seems, are no longer governed by central bankers in Washington and Bonn, but by traders and investors in Tokyo, London and New York, as the chaos in the currency markets this past week has shown.
The lucky, the canny and the nimble among them have found ways to gain an advantage even as they confront the worst monetary crisis of their lives. "I haven't seen such turmoil and uncertainty and fear in the years I have been a central banker and in the private markets," said Peter O'Shea, who served for the Irish central bank and now works in London as a managing director in foreign exchange for Morgan Stanley & Company. 
 From a trading room the size of a soccer field in Manhattan's Rockefeller Center, Lawrence Weinman, head of currency-options sales for North America at Societe Generale, a major French bank, can profit even as central bankers panic. The more jagged the markets, the more the bank's options portfolio appears to be worth.
The central bankers propose, the markets dispose. "We have the tails wagging the dogs," Mr. Weinman said.
As of February 1990, the daily worldwide volume of currency trading had reached $650 billion, more than the market value of the 10 largest American companies, according to the most recent figures from the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. Improved technology, new financial instruments and the growth of international investment have combined to make the currency markets ever more fluid.
But not everyone at the banks and investment firms is quite so cheerful as Mr. Weinman about the latest turn of events. Those who bet on the wrong currencies or failed to hedge their risks are now counting their losses. Several American mutual funds designed to exploit higher interest rates abroad became victims of volatile currencies.
Often, surviving the currency wars means passing up a profitable offensive to avoid further risks. Even those who are boasting today could be crying tomorrow.
As manager of Dreyfus Strategic World Limited Partnership and the Dreyfus Global Investing Fund, Fiona Biggs can invest in United States or foreign bonds, stocks and cash. On Friday, she put about 20 percent of her money in German bonds to take advantage of high interest rates. Then she hedged nearly all her funds' currency risks on fears that lowered German rates would knock down the value of the market.
She sold December futures contracts for marks, pounds and yen, which locked in the value of these currencies in dollars. As the dollar's value rose this week, she avoided losses, but not her continuing fears. "It could change tomorrow," she said. "Tomorrow I could look like an idiot."
Strategists have tried to avoid the temptation to chase high yields -- 15 percent in Britain, 18 percent in Italy, 500 percent in Sweden -- for fear that devaluations could more than wipe away their income. "Do you really want to borrow Swedish kronor?" said David Roche, a global strategist for Morgan Stanley. "The interest rates are surreal, but then the market conditions are surreal."
Managers and traders have several choices for hedging risks besides avoiding the weaker currencies. They can deal in options, which give them the right to buy or sell a certain amount of a currency at a given price and time: say, the right to buy British pounds for $1.75 in three months. Futures and forward contracts create obligations to buy or sell. All these devices can be used like insurance, and all have become especially costly now that investors need them most.
Many money managers have piled these instruments up like sandbags. Thomas J. Berger, the London-based manager of the $1.4 billion Blanchard Short-Term Income Fund, said that the cost of buying forward contracts was eating into the fund's income, but he had few regrets. He has kept the fund's value at between $1.89 and $1.91 a share most of the year, he said.
Yesterday afternoon in London, Mr. Berger noted that he could buy pounds for 2.73 marks to take advantage of the Bank of England's obligation to buy them the next morning at 2.78. "But we're not doing that because we think there is some danger of a devaluation," he said. "It could be tonight, it could be next week. But I suspect there are a lot of aggressive foreign exchange dealers who are buying."
A few hours later, he triumphantly called back with news that the British had abruptly backed out of their obligation to stabilize the pound. "I would expect the pound to drop like a stone," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Ad Campaign;
Clinton Addresses Unemployment

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Ad Campaign: Clinton Addresses Unemployment"
The Clinton campaign yesterday began broadcasting a 30-second commercial about the Arkansas Governor's plan to create jobs. The advertisement is appearing in about 20 states around the country; the campaign would not say which states or how often the spot would appear.
 
ON THE SCREEN The words "The Clinton Plan," followed by Mr. Clinton in a jacket and tie leaning on his desk. An American flag and an ornamental eagle are in the background. As Mr. Clinton speaks, the camera moves closer. At the end, an (800) number appears for people who want a copy of Clinton's plan.
 
PRODUCER Clinton/Gore Creative Team.
 
SCRIPT Mr. Clinton: "Government just isn't working for the hardworking families of America. We need fundamental change, not more of the same.
"That's why I've offered a comprehensive plan, a real plan to rebuild America, create eight million new jobs, invest in education and job training, insure quality, affordable health care for all.
 "We're going to ask the rich to pay their fair share so the rest of America can finally get a break. A plan to put Government back on your side. Read it yourself. Together we can make America work again."
 
ACCURACY It is not certain that the plan would create eight million jobs. It is an ambitious program and could be hard to sell in Congress. While there are many questions about how the plan would be carried out, it is conceivable that eight million jobs could be created under the right economic conditions.
 
SCORECARD The commercial is a direct appeal to the Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush four years ago but are toying with returning to the Democratic fold out of dissatisfaction with the unmployment rate and the troubled economy. Mr. Clinton looks like a statesman as he is pictured in a dignified office setting; the idea is to portray him as having a workable plan to pull the country out of economic doldrums. Mr. Clinton has used (800) numbers before to push his proposals, but Mr. Bush did it for the first time in an advertisement on the economy last week. [Photo of Bill Clinton]

Earnings at savings institutions slipped in the second quarter but the first half was the most profitable since 1986. [D12.]
 
International
General Motors and four other large foreign companies will stop selling their shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. [D1.]
Attacks on the North American Free Trade Agreement continued in Congress, with Democrats leading the criticism. [D2.]

American and Chinese negotiators concluded a third day of trade talks but remained far apart on many issues. [D13.]
 
Companies

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Revival for Toys That Bridge the Generations

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
A wave of nostalgia is sweeping toyland, where high-technology video games no longer rule the toy store shelves or children's wish lists. In their place are favorites of bygone days -- jacks, jump ropes, marbles, trolls.
Retailers are even having a hard time keeping stocked up on plastic lacing, used to make necessities like key chains and bolo ties. 
 To take advantage of this passion for the familiar, toy companies are feverishly poring over old catalogues, searching for toys that can be profitably resurrected. Thus the rebirth of Creepy Crawlers, the rubbery bugs made by pouring Plasti Goop into a mold, and the larger, 12-inch models of G.I. Joe, who last saw action at this size in 1978.
 
Charm on the Cheap
 Behind the back-to-basics movement is the weak economy: Many of the newly revived toys are inexpensive -- priced at less than $10, compared with the major capital expenditure program needed to finance a child's start-up in Super Mario land.
That makes parents and grandparents -- the toy buyers -- very happy. And they hope the children will go along, perhaps lured by the charm of playing with the same toys their parents did.
"I used to play with trolls when I was little," said Edie Sullivan of Bellevue, Wash. "Trolls are nonsexual, nonthreatening and portable."
And Mrs. Sullivan's 6-year-old daughter, Carly, is now enchanted by trolls, too. "I want to be a cheerleader," said Carly, the proud owner of 17 trolls, some of which dress like cheerleaders. Carly's sister, 9-year-old Jenny, owns 41 of the little plastic gnomes.
Michael Goldstein, vice chairman and chief financial officer of Toys "R" Us, the nation's biggest toy seller, said: "In recessionary times people tend to buy things that are simpler and that they are accustomed to. People are more averse to taking risks."
Marketing experts say the toy industry is simply responding to the same cautious consumer mind-set that has made the Gap one of the nation's fasting-growing retailers. The Gap recently introduced a line of coats based on the letter jackets popular in the 1950's.
"I don't want to say there is a return to basic values -- that sounds so much like Dan Quayle -- but toys are simply a reflection of the times," said Saul Gamoran, executive vice president of the Ace Novelty Company, the nation's largest seller of trolls, which were big hits in the 1960's.
There are demographic reasons as well. The main toy buyers are the baby boomers, who have made a near religion of worshiping and recycling the music and television shows of their lost youth.
Sean P. McGowan, a toy industry analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company, said: "There is a general disposition for the 'me generation' to associate happiness with their own childhood. There is a sense that the only toys worth having are the ones we had as kids."
He added, "I find it ironic that the women who burned bras will buy Barbie dolls in droves for their kids and the generation of men who burned their draft cards are buying G.I. Joes."
 
Memories and Economies of Scale
 Toy executives acknowledge that reviving defunct products can produce warm memories. Kirk Bozigian, vice president of marketing for boys' toys for Hasbro Inc., which makes G.I. Joe, played with the doll as a child. "My son is now 5," he said. "It is a toy I want him to have."
For the toy companies, rediscovering the old makes good economic sense. In some cases, there is no need to remake expensive molds and machinery. There is no payment to inventors and it is not as costly to advertise a familiar product to consumers.
Ace Novelty of Bellevue expects to sell $125 million in trolls this year. In the toy industry, anything that passes the $100 million mark is spoken of with the reverence and hushed tones generally reserved for Ninja turtles or for Barbie dolls, whose sales will surpass $1 billion this year. Including versions made by other companies, Ace expects 100 million trolls to be sold this year.
Company officials say they are definitely benefiting from the weak economy. A standard-issue troll costs $2.
"The low price helps a lot," said Robert Abramowitz, a vice president of Ace. "For so many years, in the toy industry, everything was so expensive."
Retailers say they are having trouble keeping trolls in stock. "Trolls are huge," said Roger Glazebrook, manager of one of the three Penny Whistle Toys stores, in New York City. "We've been sold out for weeks," he said.
 
The Pipe Cleaner's Comeback
 Financially pressed parents are also looking to do-it-yourself toys as an inexpensive way to amuse their children.
Maxwell Wellington Group, a craft supplier in Chicago, expects to sell a record 20 million feet of plastic lacing -- sometimes known as lanyard -- this year, enough to make key chains for most of the aunts and uncles in the country.
Stan Kitzes, national sales manager of the Westrim Crafts Corporation, another large craft supplier, said, "As the economy dips, we tend to strengthen."
Mr. Kitzes said pipe cleaners, popsicle sticks and other basic craft components, were also selling briskly.
 
Good Clean Fun
 Michaels Stores Inc., based in Dallas, a 160-store chain of craft stores, said its new Kids Clubs, which gives discounts for supplies, already had 70,000 members.
"It's the economy," said Carol Dillon, general craft buyer for Michaels Stores. "People are making things instead of going out and buying."
Jake Mechling, a 17-year-old from Bloomington, Ind., picked up on the lanyard craze this summer at Boy Scout camp, and came home and taught his three siblings. "We make choker collars, wrist and ankle bracelets and belts," he said.
But it's not just old toys for children that are flourishing.
Scrabble is expected to sell 1.7 million copies this year, up from 500,000 in 1989. E. David Wilson, president of the Milton Bradley company, a division of Hasbro, said, "At times like these, people look at home entertainment as opposed to other forms of entertainment."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Fewer Mandates, Fewer Votes

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
READ his lips: no new mandated benefits. President Bush, tarred as a congenital flip-flopper, is making a stand. The catch, at least from the perspective of his supporters, is that the President is manning the ideological barricades against a very popular piece of legislation passed last week by Congress -- legislation that practically screams family values.
The bill, requiring big companies to grant unpaid leave to full-time employees with newborns or seriously ill family members, has drawn fire from the Republicans' traditional allies in business. But Mr. Bush's stance is hardly likely to win votes in the suburbs, where stay-at-home mothers are becoming as rare as wood-paneled station wagons. 
 And ironically, the principle Mr. Bush is defending -- the right of labor and management to haggle freely over compensation and working conditions -- is one he has largely honored in the breach. William Alpert, an economist at the University of Connecticut, notes that the President signed a bill increasing the minimum wage and enthusiastically supported legislation that requires employers to accommodate the disabled.
The family leave bill, timed by Congressional Democrats to maximize the President's pre-election embarrassment, is virtually identical to the one he vetoed in 1990. It gives employees the option of taking up to 12 weeks to tend a new baby or care for a family member who is seriously ill.
Employers would be obliged to pick up the tab for any existing medical benefits and guarantee leave-takers comparable jobs on their return. But the law would apply only to businesses with at least 50 employees. And a company's highest-paid 10 percent of workers would be exempted.
The coverage, then, would largely affect employers who could cope by hiring temporary workers or shuffling job assignments. A 1990 report commissioned by the Small Business Administration and written by Mr. Alpert and Eileen Trzcinski of Cornell University estimates that the annual cost to business would be no more than $825 million, or about $7 a year per worker. Or perhaps nothing at all: a study for the Families and Work Institute in New York concludes that the costs would be more than offset by savings in reducing labor turnover.
Indeed, Lawrence Katz notes that the bill would exact far less from business than is demanded in other affluent countries. In Canada, for example, women have a right to 10 months off the job for pregnancy and newborn care, with the first 15 weeks at 60 percent of salary. And the Eurocrats in Brussels are aiming at a European Community standard of 14 weeks with 80 percent pay.
Why, then, the fuss here? Republican dissenters on the House Labor Committee offer a laundry list of objections. Few Americans, they say, rank parental leave as a high priority. And Federal meddling would undermine initiatives by states in setting their own labor standards. Moreover, family leave requirements would give employers incentives to discriminate against women of child-bearing age.
This last sally draws blood. There is some evidence that paid family leave requirements in Germany and Sweden have undermined women's opportunities. But Mr. Alpert scoffs at the idea that the tame American law, which exempts all employees in small businesses and senior managers in large ones, would deepen the ruts on the mommy track. And Mr. Katz suggests that a uniform standard might actually reduce discrimination in companies that already provide a leave option: With just one-third of corporate America providing the benefit today, generous companies must worry more about attracting employees inclined to use it.
The core conservative argument, one that unites libertarians and business lobbies, is blanket opposition to government mandates. "One aspect of American economic life that should remain private," writes Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, "is the negotiation between employers and employees regarding the terms under which they will cooperate."
Still, family leave seems an odd place to dig in. Federal law is full of workplace standards on everything from overtime pay to the vesting of pension rights. And while the threat of the big enchilada of mandates, employer-financed health care, has given business a new reason for concern, Mr. Katz thinks it is "absolutely ridiculous" to think a penny-an-hour family leave mandate would serve as the edge-of-the-wedge to $2-an-hour compulsory health insurance.
One former Bush Administration official not present at the creation believes it was, in fact, the innocuous quality of the family leave mandate that undid the White House. The Administration's initial stance on a seemingly unimportant measure, he speculates, was left to policy nerds more concerned with principle than the President's popularity in the shopping malls. And once articulated as a matter of principle, the White House was stuck with it.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production in U.S. Declined by 0.5% in August

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
United States industrial production declined five-tenths of 1 percent in August, suffering from Hurricane Andrew, a strike at General Motors and weak consumer spending.
The Federal Reserve also reported that the plant-use rate, a separate indicator of industrial strength, declined to 78.5 percent of capacity during the month. 
 The drop in industrial production was the largest since a decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent in January. Today's disappointing report, along with other recent indicators of the economy's weakness, provides the Fed with added reason to cut short-term interest rates again, analysts said.
 
Figures Weaker Than Expected
 "It's just a matter of timing," said William Sullivan, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. "Most of the data we've gotten for August have been weaker than expected."
The Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee next meets on Oct. 6, and many Fed watchers look for the central bank to lower rates then, if not sooner.
"This is an economy which is staggering ahead, and every once in a while it staggers backwards," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago.
Stuart Hoffman, an economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, predicted that the effects of Hurricane Andrew and the nine-day General Motors shutdown, which ended on Sept. 5, would spill over into September, producing another weak report.
Steve Wood, an economist at the Bank of America in San Francisco, said, "The factory sector of the economy is not doing well," which he said was crippling consumer spending.
As corporations scale back operations, workers are losing jobs. Manufacturing payrolls declined by 97,000 jobs in August amid widespread concern about the economy. Most of those who have not been laid off have been unable to get significant pay increases. As a result, retail sales declined five-tenths of 1 percent last month.
By category, factory output declined three-tenths of 1 percent in August, mining output dropped 1.3 percent and utility output decreased 1.2 percent.
Despite the losses, there were some pockets of strength. "Overall motor vehicle output still posted a 1 percent gain last month because increased truck production more than offset a drop in auto output," the Fed said.
During July, total industrial production increased by six-tenths of 1 percent, earlier reported as a gain of four-tenths of 1 percent, and the plant-use rate increased to 79.0 percent, earlier reported as 78.9 percent, the Fed report said.
Separately, the Commerce Department said business inventories had risen one-tenth of 1 percent in July after a revised increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in June. This reflects lackluster demand and the hesitancy of businesses to build stockpiles of goods, said Marco Babic, an analyst at Evans Economics in Washington.

HEADLINE: 1.1% Growth in World Economy Seen

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
After experiencing no growth last year, the world economy will expand only 1.1 percent this year and accelerate to a merely respectable 3 percent next year, the International Monetary Fund predicted today.
But even that 3 percent means that the recovery will be weaker than most other postwar rebounds, the fund added in its semiannual economic forecast, making clear that the global economy would largely parallel the ups and downs of the United States, which accounts for 25 percent of world output. 
 "Notwithstanding signs of recovery in the industrial countries, the expansion continues to be slow and uneven, and the balance of risks remains on the downside," the report said.
 
Debt Burdens Pose Risks
 Those risks include depressed consumer confidence and the large debt burdens that have discouraged many households and businesses in the wealthy nations from increasing spending.
These factors helped push the monetary fund to revise downward the estimates for world growth it made in May. At that time, the I.M.F. said the world economy would expand by 1.4 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 1993.
The report, called the World Economic Outlook, said the United States economy was being spurred by low interest rates and would grow by 1.9 percent this year over last year, and by 3.1 percent next year. Because of stronger than expected growth in the first quarter, the fund raised its estimate for American growth this year from the 1.6 percent estimate it made in May.
The fund said inflation in the United States would be 2.7 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year, down from 4.1 percent last year.
The fund forecasts a 16.8 percent plunge in output in the countries of the former Soviet bloc this year, a big factor depressing world growth. The fund said growth in several of these countries would soon start to pick up, and it foresees a 4.5 percent drop in output for them next year.
The brightest news in the report was the strong growth anticipated for the developing world, which the fund said would grow by 6.2 percent this year and the same next year, compared with 3.3 percent last year.
That compares with a forecast of 1.7 percent growth in the industrialized world this year, and 2.9 percent next year.
 
Growth in Developing Nations
 Developing nations have grown strongly, despite the weak international environment, because many have adopted successful reforms like reducing inflation, privatizing state industry and creating incentives for private investment.
"During the recent period of sluggish global growth, the successful reformers have registered sustained and relatively rapid increases in output," said report. "They key to their performance has been determined efforts to reduce fiscal deficts and to control inflation."
Those countries have also been helped by agreements that have reduced their debt burdens and by lower short-term interest rates that have lightened their debt service.
Pointing to the link between economic reform and growth, the report said Latin American countries that had made widespread changes -- many of which had been prescribed by the monetary fund -- would grow by 4.4 percent this year, while those that had not were expected to grow by 1.8 percent. In Africa, countries that have pursued reforms are expected to grow by 4.1 percent, while those that have not will grow by 1.7 percent, the fund said.
"There are very great regional differences in the performance of developing countries," Michael Mussa, the fund's chief economist, said at a news conference today. Developing countries in Asia are expected to grow by 6.6 percent, those in Africa by 3.3 percent.
In blunt language, the report urged the United States to slash its $320 billion budget deficit, which it said was undermining growth by sapping consumer and business confidence and pushing up long-term interest rates in America and beyond. The report called on Washington not just to cut spending to reduce the deficit, but also to raise taxes.
The deficit "is a factor that is limiting investment and growth in the U.S. economy and is having similar effect on the world economy," Mr. Mussa said.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN EUROPE;
Fed Action On Europe Not Expected

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The turmoil in European's financial markets is primarily a European affair and the United States will not get involved in trying to help steady Europe's jitters, officials of the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve said today.
In fact, the turbulence could actually help both the American and the European economies, the officials said, because it could lead to lower interest rates and thus spur growth in Europe that would ultimately give the United States a boost as well. 
 Beyond that, Europe's foreign exchange trauma has given the Federal Reserve more flexibility to lower interest rates, because the trauma has strengthened the dollar, they said. The dollar's extreme weakness early this month prevented the Federal Reserve from cutting rates by more than the one-quarter point cut it announced on Sept. 4.
 
Fed Under Pressure
 In a speech today in Los Angeles, David W. Mullins Jr., the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the present European turmoil was essentially a European phenomenon.
"We're staying on the sidelines," said one Fed official.
But clearly the United States is not unaffected. Since the election season began, the Fed has been under intense pressure from both Congress and the White House to lower interest rates even further than they have. The rates are now the lowest they have been in three decades.
Fed officials acknowledged that if they had wanted to lower rates this week, they probably could not have done so. The step would have been be akin to throwing a great rock into an already unsettled pond.
An American rate cut would probably strengthen the German mark, and increase tensions in Europe, pressuring other nations to raise their interest rates and protect their currencies against the mark.
 
More Flexibility for Fed
 "What's happening in Europe gives the Fed a little more flexibility," said Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist with James Capel Inc. in New York. "They certainly won't cut rates this week, but they might do it in early October when the September employment report is released. I expect unemployment to be higher in that report."
One senior Administration official praised the idea of devaluations in Europe, saying that they would spur growth there. Faster growth in Italy or Britain should ultimately mean that those countries would import more American goods.
That official also said that such devaluations would lessen the need for these devaluing countries to jack up interest rates to defend their currency from falling against the German mark. Under the European Monetary System, member nations are required, barring a formal devaluation, to keep their currencies from falling against the mark.
Lower interest would spur growth in the devaluing nations and help spur their growth -- and growth throughout Europe.
 
Rooting for German Cuts
 European Community finance ministers are expected to announce more devaluations along the lines of the devaluation of the Italian lira.
[In Brussels early Thursday, the European Community finance ministers agreed to devalue the Spanish peseta and suspend the lira from the exchange rate system.]
"We want more of the same," said John Williamson, an economist with the Institute for International Economics. He said he feared that the Europeans might decide to keep some currencies at unrealistically high levels against the mark and that this could hinder growth by forcing some countries to raise rates. He was also rooting for further rate cuts by Germany's central bank.
American officials said the devaluations in Europe were not unalloyed good news because they could strengthen the dollar vis-a-vis the pound and lira, and thus make American goods less competitive versus British and Italian goods. But these officials said the devluations might help strengthen the mark against the dollar, and that could help America's competitive position.
 
Market Plunge Feared
 The big fear that American officials expressed was that the commotion in Europe could cause American stock and bond markets to plunge. One official said the fact that the New York Stock Exchange slid today while the dollar strengthened showed that the European situation was undermining investor confidence.
American officials said Europe's exchange rate markets will be at or near the top of the agenda when the Group of Seven's finance ministers meet Saturday in Washington. Originally, the weak dollar was scheduled to be topic No. 1.
Some economists suggested that the United States might push the Europeans to structure their monetary system in a way that countries other than Germany do not repeatedly have to jack up their interest rates to defend their currencies, thus slowing their economic growth.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Uncertainty Widens Bond Spread

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The long end of the American bond market was knocked lower by the turmoil in European currency markets yesterday, but shorter maturities, including two- and three-year notes, rose.
The behavior of the market was a classic reaction to uncertainity and pushed the spread or differential between the two-year note and the 30-year note to a record level. 
 The new record was the surest sign in a day of volatile and thin trading that the troubled outlook for Europe had battered traders, investors and speculators in New York, although the consequences of what is going on abroad could actually benefit the bond market.
"I get the strong sense that people don't know what to do," said Robert Di Clemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York. "It is just not clear where the balance comes out and it is not clear-cut what the market should do or what the implications are for our markets."
 
Figuring Out the Impact

All eyes are now on Europe as analysts and investors try to figure out the probable impact of Britain's surprise decision to suspend its participation in the European Monetary System, which links the currencies of 11 European countries in fixed trading bands. The system was designed to bring, and had brought, stability to European foreign-exchange trading.
But the system came under severe strain this summer as the German mark rallied because of concern over the outlook for the economic union of Europe.
With polls showing that a French referendum on Sunday might turn down the next steps to an economic union, the pound and the Italian lira plummeted. And even a hasty lira devaluation and small German interest-rate cuts on Monday could not relieve the pressure.
And when the British pound slipped below the bottom of its allowed trading floor despite a five-percentage-point increase in Bank of England interest rates yesterday, the Government of Prime Minister John Major apparently had no choice but to devalue the pound by withdrawing from the monetary system.
 
System's Future Uncertain
 The British decision calls into question the future of the monetary system, and until it is clear what happens next, investors may be leery of taking positions, which means thin trading and volatile moves like those in New York trading yesterday.
In late trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the price of the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was off 7/32 to yield 7.32 percent, up from 7.30 percent Tuesday.
The bond had been off sharply in the morning and then rallied up to a few seconds before the British announcement. Barbara L. Kenworthy, portfolio manager of fixed-income funds at the Dreyfus Corporation, said the morning decline had been caused in part by central-bank selling of Treasury securities to raise the cash needed for the futile effort to support the British pound and Italian lira.
But the price of the two-year 4.25 percent note was up 3/32 to yield 3.79 percent, compared with 3.84 percent the day before. And the price of the 4.625 percent three-year note was up 4/32 to yield 4.31 percent, down from 4.35 percent. The spread between the yield on the two-year note and the 30-year bond rose to 353 basis points or hundredths of a percentage point, eclipsing the mark of 349 basis points set Monday.
 
A Possible Positive Side
 When there is uncertainity in the market, investors tend to get out of longer maturities because they are more volatile and subject to greater losses if some unexpected event occurs.
The discount rates on three-month, six-month and one-year Treasury bills also fell yesterday. The move, and the fall in yields on the two-year and three-year notes, also reflect one of the positive beneifts of the turmoil in Europe -- the possibilty that the Federal Reserve will gain the freedom it needs to lower short-term interests here further.
Already the dollar had risen since the German rate cut Monday and it rallied again yesterday. An eventual agreement among European members on a broad devalualtion of currencies against the German mark could also mean a further rate cut by the Germans, helping the dollar more. And the uncertainity in Europe is likely to bring some foreign investors to the United States, where the basic economic fundamentals are good for the bond market.
"When the dust settles, we will find that this is a net plus for the United States," said Stephen Slifer, financial market economist at Lehman Brothers.
 
Foreign Bonds
 Foreign bonds markets were in turmoil but closed before the final British decison to devalue the pound. Ms. Kenworthy of Dreyfus said it was hard to get prices in the cash bond markets, which means that traders were unwilling to take a position in the face of such uncertainity.
In London, in a sign of the turmoil, the futures contract on the 10-year bond ended higher despite the interest-rate increases while the price of the active active 10-year bond closed down.
But in Germany and France, in heavy trading, bond prices rose on the expectation that the Germans would eventually have to lower interest rates to calm financial markets.

HEADLINE: Erratic Day Sees Stocks Drop Again

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices lost more ground yesterday, bouncing erratically as traders tried to sort out the outlook for foreign-exchange markets and interest rates worldwide.
The Dow Jones industrials, down 48.90 points on Tuesday, lost another 8.11 points, to 3,319.21. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume climbed to an estimated 231.6 million shares, from 211.9 million Tuesday. 
 The stock market rallied sharply at the start of the week as German authorities cut interest rates, presumably breaking a logjam of conflicting monetary policies among major industrialized countries. But by Tuesday, investors took a much less ebullient view, noting a variety of unresolved issues and questions, and sent stocks lower.
 
Defending the Pound
 Yesterday began with news that British officials had raised interest rates to defend the pound. Later, they said they would suspend the currency from the system known as the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. That posed uncertainties for the campaign to set up closer monetary and economic ties among European nations, which faces an important referendum in France on Sunday.
Amid the confusion, many American depository shares of European companies ran into selling pressure. Imperial Chemical, for example, fell 7/8 to 78 1/2; Fiat 1 1/8, to 14 3/8; British Telecom 1 5/8, to 62 7/8; British Air 7/8, to 49 5/8, and Montedison 1/4, to 9. But Hanson of Britain rose 1/4, to 19 5/8, and Royal Dutch Petroleum added 1, to 86 3/4.
Analysts said the potential effects on individual businesses and industries of a scrambled European political and economic picture would be complex and widely varying.
Whatever course events take in Europe, brokers also caution, the effect on any economic recovery in the United States was unclear.
 
Outlook at First Interstate
 Losers among the blue chips included I.B.M., down 2 3/8 at 83 1/8; General Motors, down 5/8 at 33 1/4; Boeing, down 1 at 35 3/4; Du Pont, down 1 1/8 at 46 3/4, and A.T.& T., down 1/2 at 44 1/8.
First Interstate Bancorp rose 2 1/8, to 38 3/8. The bank holding company raised its earnings forecast for 1992 and lowered its projected nonperforming assets as of year's end.
Syntex edged up 1/8, to 28 1/2, in active trading. The company said directors had approved a plan to buy back as many as seven million shares.
Proteon, traded over the counter, fell 3 3/4, to 11 1/4. The company said its third-quarter earnings would be below expectations, and added that fourth-quarter results could disappoint as well.
Topps, another Nasdaq issue, fell 3/4, to 16 3/4. The company posted quarterly earnings that came in a shade below what most analysts had been expecting.
The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues dropped 1.97 points, to 585.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the Market Value Index was down 0.21 at 385.52.

HEADLINE: OPEC Meets on Output

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GENEVA, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries met today, hoping to find a production accord that will nudge crude oil prices up this winter.
Prices for crude oil pumped by the 13 OPEC members have been rising as customers buy oil ahead of the cold weather and analysts expect that growing demand could bump up prices by $1 to $2 a barrel in the coming months. 
 "Whatever is decided here -- unless there is a breakdown in the negotiations -- prices will continue to move up somewhat," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "The trend now is upward."
The ministers met for about two and a half hours before adjourning to bargain behind closed doors.
Secretary General Subroto of OPEC said they discussed the world economic situation and noted the continued weakness of industrialized economies.
"The expectation of a recovery in the second half of 1992 has not materialized," he told reporters. "On top of that, there is this turmoil in the foreign exchange market."
The OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

HEADLINE: U.S.-China Rift at Trade Talks Is Still Wide

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 16

 BODY:
American and Chinese negotiators concluded a third day of talks today on a number of contentious trade issues, but the two sides remained far apart on what could prove a landmark trade agreement.
The United States has given China until Oct. 10 to agree to lower a range of import barriers or face punitive tariffs against $3.9 billion worth of Chinese exports to the United States. China has threatened to retaliate by raising tariffs on $4 billion worth of imports of American goods if the United States imposes sanctions. 
 "Although there is still a sizable gap between the positions of the two sides, and much work remains, I remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached by the Oct. 10 deadline," said Michael Moskow, the deputy United States trade representative who is part of the negotiations.
 
Trade More Crucial for China
 Mr. Moskow dismissed China's threat to impose its own sanctions since, he said, China sends about a fourth of all its exports to the American market but takes less than 2 percent of America's exports.
"I think it's clear the impact would be much more significant on China than on the United States," he said.
Although Mr. Moskow tried to put the discussions in a positive light, American officials said that none of the substantive issues had been resolved. These include American demands that China provide more information on its trade polices and rules, that it remove import prohibitions and quotas, that it stop the practice of requiring importers to obtain Government licenses and that it change testing requirements that keep out some imports.
The Americans reported that the Chinese had not pressed the most sensitive issue, President Bush's decision to sell 150 F-16 jet fighters to Taiwan. China has insisted that the sale violates a 1982 agreement in which the United States agreed to phase out its weapons sales to the Nationalist Government on Taiwan, which the Chinese regard as a renegade province.
"They may have commented about the fact that this had happened, but it was never a serious part of the discussion," Mr. Moskow said.
Discussions at the technical level will continue here one more day, then will resume in Washington on Oct. 1. They are expected to continue to Oct. 10, and perhaps after that.
American officials have made it clear that if the talks fail, in addition to imposing the sharply higher tariffs, they will also block China from membership in the body that oversees the world trading system, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as the GATT.
That raises the stakes significantly for China, since its economy has grown increasingly reliant on trade for its rapid growth rate and growing prosperity.
Trade as a percentage of China's gross national product has risen from 9.9 percent in 1978 to 31.3 percent in 1990, according to official figures. China's trade surplus with the United States has soared, too. It was $12.7 billion last year and is expected to run at $15 billion to $19 billion this year.

HEADLINE: S.& L.'s Earn $2.81 Billion In Best 6 Months Since 1986

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Earnings at the nation's savings institutions slipped a bit in the second quarter but the first half was the industry's most profitable six months since 1986, the Government said today.
Profits at the 2,013 so-called private sector institutions -- those that have not been seized by the Government -- totaled $1.27 billion in the second quarter, down 18 percent from $1.54 billion in the first three months of the year, the Office of Thrift Supervision said. 
 But net income for the first half of 1992 was more than triple the $885 million earned during the first half of 1991. It was the best six months since October 1985 through March 1986.
 
Bad Loans at HomeFed
 Officials at the office attributed about half of the second-quarter deterioration to the write-off of bad loans by HomeFed Bank in San Diego, which was seized by regulators in early July, just after the closing date for today's financial data.
Timothy Ryan, the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, attributed the improvement this year to the extremely wide gap between interest rates paid on deposits and those earned on mortgage loans, and to the Government's program of shutting down insolvent institutions.
Mr. Ryan warned institutions not to depend on current low interest rates, which he said would inevitably rise. About 40 percent of the industry is vulnerable to losses if rates rise by two percentage points, he said.
Mr. Ryan also asked Congress to supply money to the Resolution Trust Corporation, which has lacked the funds to shut down insolvent institutions since April 1. The delay in financing has already added $750 million to the cost of the savings and loan bailout, he said.
Only 26 institutions with $19 billion in assets remain in the group of savings and loans the office considers likely to become wards of the Resolution Trust Corporation.
"To be at the end of the process and to be on hold is very frustrating," he said.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields on Taxable Funds Drop Under 3%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Yields on taxable money market funds fell below 3 percent for the first time since 1975 in the week ended Tuesday, The IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report said yesterday.
The drop in taxable yields was a continuation of the decline that began last week, when yields fell in response to the Federal Reserve Board's quarter-point cut in the overnight Federal funds rate on Sept. 4. 
 The drop in taxable yields stood in marked contrast to the performance of yields on tax-exempt money market funds. For the second straight week, heavy issuance of new municipal bonds pushed up yields on tax-exempt funds, IBC/Donoghue said.
 
Assets Are Down
 According to IBC/Donoghue's, the assets of 309 tax-free money funds fell by $799 million in the week, to $95.1 billion. The average number of days left to maturity of securities held in fund portfolios fell by two days, to 65.
The seven-day average compounded yield on the tax-exempt funds rose 5 basis points, to 2.44 percent, and the simple yield rose a similar amount, to 2.41 percent. Over a 30-day period, the average compounded and simple yields rose by 7 basis points and 8 basis points, respectively, to 2.33 percent and 2.31 percent. A basis point in a hundredth of a percentage point.
Not assuming state taxes, the taxable equivalent yield on the seven-day compounded yield is 3.39 percent for investors in the 28 percent bracket, up 7 basis points. The equivalent for investors in the 31 percent bracket is 3.54 percent, up 8 basis points.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue said the Dreyfus Basic Municipal fund was the best-performing fund, with a return of 3.25 percent.
 
Taxable Funds
 Meanwhile, yields in taxable money market funds fell sharply for the second straight week, even though total assets held by those funds rose slightly.
Through Tuesday, 553 taxable funds held assets of $499.4 billion, up $43 million.
The average seven-day compounded yield on these taxable funds was 2.94 percent, down 7 basis points for the week. That is the lowest yield level on a taxable money market fund since IBC/Donoghue began tracking money market funds in 1975. The seven-day simple yield was 2.90 percent, down 6 basis points.
For a 30-day average, the compounded and simple yields fell by 4 basis points and 3 basis points, respectively, to 3.02 percent and 2.98 percent.
Since changes in money market fund yields generally lag behind movements in the Federal funds rate, Mary Sue Hoban, a spokeswoman for IBC/Donoghue, said that compounded yields on taxable money market funds will probably fall another 10 basis points from current levels before they reflect the Fed's 25 basis- point cut in the funds rate on Sept. 4.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in portfolios rose by one, to 64.
The Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund was the best performer among large general purpose funds, with a yield of 3.77 percent. But including funds with assets of less than $100 million that invest only in Government securities, the United Services Government Securities Savings fund, distributed by United Services Advisors in San Antonio, was once again the top performer, with a yield of 4.09 percent.
By comparison, the average bank money market account slipped 6 basis points this week, to yield 2.92 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Broad Rally for the Dollar On the Upheaval in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The pound tumbled yesterday despite dramatic moves by the British Government to defend it, deepening the monetary crisis in Europe and sharply lifting the dollar's value as a safe-harbor currency.
"It's been a very hectic day," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the New York branch of the Bank Leumi Trust Company. "There was a lot of blood in the sterling pits today. A lot of people were very confused." 
 Britain's actions were only part of a frenetic day marked by dramatic government interventions elsewhere in Europe. Sweden's central bank raised a key lending rate to a staggering 500 percent in an attempt to defend its currency the krona, while Italy's central bank bought lire to support that currency's value.
In response, many investors fled to dollar-denominated investments as a haven, temporarily ignoring the dollar's unattractiveness in terms of the United States economy's own economic malaise and the uncertain outcome of the Presidential campaigns.
"With Europe in such a big mess, the skirmish between George Bush and Bill Clinton doesn't matter for the time being; so I go into the currency that I know," said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief trader at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia.
 
Dollar Up Against Yen
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.30 yen, down 0.58 yen from Monday; Tokyo markets were closed for a national holiday Tuesday. But later in London it rose to 124.90 yen. And in New York the dollar fetched 125.15 yen, up from 124.25 yen late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with levels late Tuesday, were: 1.5140 German marks, up from 1.4910; 1.3230 Swiss francs, up from 1.3195; 1.2236 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2172; 5.1528 French francs, up from 5.0640, and 1,257 Italian lire, up from 1,205.50.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.5185 German marks, up from 1.4855; 1.3210 Swiss francs, up from 1.3145; 5.1325 French francs, up from 5.0450; 1.7055 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6733; 1,246.50 lire, up from 1,193.48, and 1.2200 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2187.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN EUROPE;
Why the Currency Crisis Erupted: A Primer

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
A currency crisis is something that is not supposed to happen these days. The very idea evokes images from old newsreels, with grave statesmen in top hats emerging from limousines to urge calm in gravelly voices. But suddenly Europe is up to its eyebrows in one. And while the immediate impact on most people's daily lives will be slight, it could derail the drive to European unity that only a few months ago seemed as inevitable as tomorrow's sunrise.
How could something so important have happened with so little warning? And why are elected officials who have staked their careers on the currency arrangement known as the European Monetary System seemingly powerless to prevent its meltdown? The answers lie in the basic economics of international finance -- and the even more basic conflicts between domestic and regional political priorities.
 
Trading Francs for Pounds
 Francs are the coin of the realm in France. But when a French company wants to import machinery from a producer in Manchester, England, it must pay the bills in British pounds. And to obtain the pounds, the company must find someone willing to exchange British currency for francs. 
 The exchange rate is thus the price of pounds in francs, or francs in pounds. And it must roughly reflect the relative purchasing power of the two currencies in their home markets. If, for example, a drill press costs 1,000 francs in Paris and 200 in London, the exchange rate had better be more or less 5 francs to the pound. Otherwise, both the British and the French will buy all their drills presses on one side of the Channel.
But like life, economics rarely works out so neatly. In the short run, currency exchange rates are influenced by many factors, including the behavior of governments. And since the rates have enormous impact on where goods that can be traded are made and how much they cost, exchange rates are a matter of great interest to the people in charge of national economies.
Most countries (including the United States) allow their currencies to "float" against others. Voluntary transactions between private buyers and sellers determine a currency's value. That suits many politicians, since setting a fixed exchange rate would force them to balance the interests of domestic producers against those of consumers buying goods from abroad.
But European leaders are immensely taken by the idea of maintaining very stable exchange rates within the greater European economy, and for two reasons. First the system eliminates uncertainty, greasing the wheels of commerce within Europe. A German truck maker can set a price for its trucks in Italian lira, for delivery in six months, because it knows what the exchange rate between marks and lira will be.
More important, a fixed exchange system imposes a collective discipline on all the national economies linked to the system. If, for example, Italy allows inflation at home to drive up production costs at its factories, a fixed exchange rate with the mark (and pound and franc) will make Italian products from those factories too expensive to sell abroad.
Indeed, from this perspective, the only other thing better than maintaining fixed exchange rates among European currencies is the adoption of a single currency for the whole European economy. And that is just what European Community leaders proposed to do in the Maastricht agreement on European political and economic union, which they signed last December.
The signatories at Maastricht, visionaries who generally speak of the agreement in political terms, appeared to comprehend that a successful currency union -- or for that matter, a stable fixed exchange rate system -- demanded coordination of virtually all aspects of national economic policy. But they were unable to accomplish that before the currency crisis erupted.
 
Price of Unification
 Two years ago, West Germany took on the burden of paying for German unification. But the price of bringing eastern Germany up to snuff and subsidizing the easterners' living standards in the meantime has been far higher than anyone guessed. And the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has balked at raising taxes sufficiently to keep Germany's budget in balance.
Germany's inflation-wary (and very independent) central bank reacted by jacking up interest rates. Foreigners responded by purchasing tens of billions of dollars' worth of German marks and investing the proceeds in German bank deposits paying as much as 9 percent interest -- a far higher interest rate than they could get by depositing their money in New York.
Not surprisingly, the price of the mark soared with respect to the dollar as traders found it evermore difficult to find people to sell them the German currency. What should not have surprised anyone, but somehow did, was the reaction in currency markets in the rest of Europe.
Since, by government agreement, all the leading European currencies were tied to the mark, they, too, rose sharply in value relative to the dollar. But in the last month, the banks and corporations that control much of the worlds' currency in private hands wondered whether these agreements would stick. And with good reason.
 
Last Thing They Wanted
 To maintain fixed exchange rates with Germany, other European countries were forced to raise their interest rates to make it as attractive for investors to hold these nations' currencies as it was to hold German marks. But with Britain deep in recession and other European economies heading there, the last thing that European leaders wanted to do was to discourage domestic spending by raising interest rates.
Check that: the very last thing they wanted to do was to allow their currencies to remain high against the dollar for very long. Much of their trade, after all, is with the United States. And a strong pound or franc or lira makes their goods more expensive and harder to sell in the country that pays its bills in greenbacks.
The more traders thought about it, the less they wanted to take the chance of being caught holding currencies other than German marks on the day that European governments were unable to defend fixed exchange rates. Britain tried to bluff, effectively arguing that it would do anything to hold the line. But in the end, the traders' prophecy proved to be self-fulfilling.
The economic damage is likely to be modest. Indeed, the currency realignment forced by the German policy of tight money and high interest rates could do a lot of good in the short run.
The longer-term impact is harder to assess. In the best of worlds, it will teach Europeans a relatively painless lesson about the importance of coordinating their economic policies.

HEADLINE: Twice as Many Families Seek Space in City Shelters

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The number of homeless families entering New York City's troubled shelter system this summer is almost twice last summer's level, causing a backup that has left more than 100 families a night sleeping on floors and tables in city welfare offices.
Most of the families flooding the system this summer have sought emergency shelter before -- an indication that they are having a tougher time finding permanent housing they can afford or staying doubled up with friends and family in the recession, city officials say. 
 "It's an explosion," said Ken Murphy, deputy commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration. "Two or three years ago, we had to place maybe 75 families each night. Last night, we placed 210 families and still had 143 left over in the offices at 8 A.M."
During July and August this year, 13,994 families went to city offices seeking shelter, he said. Last year, only 7,526 did.
Homeless families, usually mothers with children, often churn in and out of the shelters, staying with friends of family whenever they can. Despite the constant movement, the system has reached an all-time high. The number of families in the system is now 5,376, city officials said.
The backup of families in offices where they apply for shelter has provoked a bitter exchange between state and city officials who are blaming each other for the system's failures.
State welfare officials have ordered the city to improve conditions quickly for the families or face financial sanctions.
For their part, city officials are blaming the problem on the state's housing allowance for welfare families, saying it is too low to allow families to pay rent in the city.
Advocates for the homeless appear to have helped set off the feud between the city and state by threatening a new lawsuit if nothing is done to help the families.
The Legal Aid Society said in in a letter to the state last month that it was considering going to court to try to force it to run the city's vast, overburdened shelter system. The lawyers said the state had failed to enforce its own rules that require families to be promptly sheltered in decent housing.
"For at least two years, the state has sat back and permitted the city on a nightly basis to harm hundreds of families with children," said Steve Banks, coordinating attorney for the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Family Rights Project.
Less than two weeks after the Legal Aid Society wrote the state, the state's Commissioner of Social Services, Mary Jo Bane, fired off an ultimatum to the city insisting that the city immediately end the practice of overnight stays in offices.
"Further delay cannot be accepted," she wrote on Sept. 10.
Ms. Bane said her action was not a response to Legal Aid's threatened suit, but to the surging number of families stuck in city offices. But she conceded that the prospect of the state running the city's shelter system "was not a happy thought."
"It is certainly not something we aspire to do," she said. "Anybody who tried to run the shelter system would find it quite difficult."
 
Fingers of Blame
 City officials have responded angrily to Ms. Bane's letter. They say the state's shelter allowance has not kept pace with rising rent costs. In 1975, the monthly allowance of $218 a month for a family of four covered the rental costs of 95 percent of families on welfare in the city, while this year, the rental allowance of $312 a month covered the rents of only a third of the families.
"This is a continuation of the myopic state public policy which has brought us to the present crisis situation," Barbara J. Sabol, who heads the city's Human Resources Administration, wrote in answer to Ms. Bane.
As city and state officials point fingers of blame at each other, hundreds of homeless families are now spending the night on tables, in hard plastic chairs and even on the floors of the four city offices where the homeless initially apply for emergency shelter.
It is not clear why the numbers have jumped so suddenly. "That's the question of the hour," said Terrance M. McGrath, a spokesman for the State Department of Social Services.
City and state officials speculate that the worsening economy has contributed to the rise. This July, the number of New Yorkers on welfare surpassed one million for the first time since the 1970's.
The backlog is likely to be made worse over the coming year because the number of units of permanent housing the city has to give to homeless families in its shelter system has declined. Three years ago the city provided 5,000 units of housing. That number has steadily declined to about 3,600 this year.
"People are having a harder and harder time getting out of the system," Mr. Murphy said.
 
Fewer Apartments Found
 The city's public housing authority, worried that too many troubled homeless families were destabilizing its projects, recently negotiated a reduction in the number of homeless families it will place from 2,000 to about 1,400.
And the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which usually produces about 75 to 100 apartments a month, is behind schedule. In August, it came up with only three apartments, city officials said. More apartments will begin becoming available in November, but the delay has made it more difficult for the city to move families out of the shelters into permanent housing.
Mr. Murphy speculated that families on hard times who have cycled in and our of the shelters over the last couple of years have progressively worn out their welcome with the friends and relatives they stay with when not in a shelter.
The city's Human Resources Administration developed a new plan this spring for handling homeless families coming into the system. It proposed consolidating the four offices, one in every borough except Staten Island, where homeless families apply for shelter into one office at 325 Hudson Street, at King Street, in Manhattan.
The goal is to centralize all the services and to make it easier for the city to keep track of all the homeless families entering the system. The consolidation would also save the city about $400,000 a year through staff reductions. Several prominent advocates for the homeless, including Anna Lou Dehavenon, an urban anthropologist, supported the plan.
But it has suffered repeated setbacks, the latest one yesterday when Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan came out against it. Community Board 2, as well as several prominent advocates for the homeless who served on the Mayor's commission on homelessness, strongly opposed the consolidation plan.
 
Lobbying Effort
 Andrew Cuomo, who headed Mayor David N. Dinkins's blue-ribbon commission on the homeless, said the consolidation was meant to make it more difficult for families to enter the system.
Last month a group of residents and business people near the Hudson Street project hired Sid Davidoff, the lobbyist who is a close friend of Mayor Dinkins, to represent them in their battle against the project.
Then at a hearing before Ms. Messinger on Sept. 9, part of the city's convoluted land-use process, the Human Resources Administration did not come forward to make the case for its own proposal.
The administration's officials said they were in the audience at the public hearing but chose not to come forward. They had already made their case at earlier meetings. But Ms. Messinger said in her 10-page decision on the issue, released yesterday, that she interpreted the administration's silence as a lack of enthusiasm for its own consolidation project.

HEADLINE: Public and Private Mix at Columbia

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Amid whirling flashing gadgets of the future, political and academic leaders gathered at Columbia University yesterday to dedicate a research center that they hope will help create thousands of new jobs over the decades.
The Morris A. Schapiro Center for Engineering and Physical Science Research, an amalgam of state, Federal and university research programs -- most of whose $115 million cost was financed by the state -- is intended to promote greater cooperation between scientists from academia and corporations by encouraging them to work side-by-side on projects. 
 At a time when New York is suffering from its most severe loss of jobs since World War II, the hope is that such a collaboration will make the state, and the country, much better at something in which it has been deficient in recent decades: turning important scientific discoveries into the kinds of sellable high-technology products that can reverse the decline in manufacturing jobs.
 
More Than Gleam in Eye
 The center's research will focus on telecommunications, microelectronics and computer science. As a tour of the laboratories revealed, many of these potential products are already much more than the gleam in a scientist's eye.
There were robotic hands that could twirl balls, turn knobs and sense the things they touched much like the real thing. There were computerized eyes that could keep tabs on moving objects and feed the information to a robotic arm. And there was an embryonic telecommunications system that used light to transmit conversations, images, faxes and computer data simultaneously; a prototype will soon be installed at Columbia.
"Our prosperity and national strength depend increasingly on research like that taking place here," Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, said at the dedication ceremony on the upper Manhattan campus.
The Schapiro center -- named for an investment banker and Columbia alumnus who donated $10 million to the project -- is not new in one sense; the building is merely providing a bigger home for several existing cooperative research programs established by the state and Federal Governments at Columbia, as well as some of the school's research efforts.
 
'About Being Intelligent'
 New York has established nine centers for research in advanced technology since 1983 at universities across the state. At a time when the role of governments in improving industrial competitiveness and stimulating the economy is being debated heatedly across the nation, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo made it clear where he stands.
Ridiculing the extremists in the debate, he described himself as a "progressive pragmatist" who believes that business alone cannot not summon the resources needed to compete against the likes of the Japanese and the European Community.
"In a world like that, you had better get your government a little bit involved," he said at the dedication. "I'm not talking about neo-socialism. I'm not talking about being intrusive. I'm talking about being intelligent and doing the things collectively what you could not do at all or so well individually: helping research, helping science, helping education."
In an interview, Yechiam Yemini, director of the state center for advanced technology at Columbia, said research at his unit had led to the creation of more than a dozen companies, eight of which still existed. The eight -- including computer hardware and software companies and securities-trading companies -- employ more than 500 people, about 200 of them in New York, he said.
A 1991 study of the impact of nine centers found that they had led to the creation of 47 companies.
The state has invested $61 million in the research programs, excluding the investment in the new building, said Theresa A. Walker, manager of university-industry programs at the New York State Science and Technology Foundation.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Women;
For Feminists, It Wasn't What They Had in Mind

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
The New York Senate primary, one of the highest visibility races in this political year, turned into a crushing disappointment for the feminist movement yesterday. There were bitter divisions. There were wounds to be healed. And there were questions about the damage to the political careers of two feminist heroines, Geraldine A. Ferraro and Elizabeth Holtzman.
For Ms. Ferraro, who spent the day in seclusion, her loss after attacks on her family's finances and ethics was a wrenching reprise of the 1984 Vice-Presidential race. After eight years of obscurity, she made a bid for redemption only to watch a strong lead evaporate once again under a barrage of questions about her husband's business dealings and accusations that he was associated with organized crime figures. 
 Ms. Holtzman, the steely City Comptroller who had longed for 12 years for a second attempt at the Senate seat she narrowly lost in 1980, came in dead last, behind the Rev. Al Sharpton. In the process she waged a campaign so negative that some politicians are now asking if she has damaged herself for the future.
Once the Democratic primary for the right to challenge Alfonse M. D'Amato had been seen by feminists as almost an agonizing embarrassment of riches in what they call the year of the woman. Here was Ms. Ferraro, the charismatic pathbreaker, and Ms. Holtzman, the feminist purist, both seeking the same office. Many women's groups gave the two idols joint endorsements, and then watched anxiously as the heroines faced off in a race that turned ever more bitter.
 
'Missed Opportunity'
 In Washington yesterday, leaders of the major women's groups could only express dismay that it was a man, Robert Abrams, who had narrowly won the Democratic race.
"It's a terrible disappointment because New York is a state that was ready to and would elect a woman to the United States Senate," said Harriett Woods, president of the National Women's Political Caucus. "It's a great missed opportunity."
But in New York, where each candidate had devoted female followers, the post-election debate among feminists was poisonous.
Letty Cottin Pogrebin, a founding editor of Ms. magazine, denounced the tenor of Ms. Holtzman's campaign, which consisted of unrelenting attacks on Ms. Ferraro's ethics. "In my view and the view of many other people with whom I have spoken, I will never support her for anything again," she said. "Her turn would have come. It was clear she never could have won this race. It was hubris that kept her in."
But Betty Friedan, the feminist author, said Ms. Ferraro's supporters had only themselves to blame for their defeat. "What is this, for God's sakes?" she asked, almost shouting. "Why should Holtzman be blamed for Geraldine Ferraro's defeat?"
 
Settling Old Scores
 "How dare they try to blame Liz Holtzman for the question marks about Geraldine Ferraro," she said. "Blame the people who put forward a candidate about whom they knew these questions existed."
For both Ms. Ferraro and Ms. Holtzman, this Senate race had a special resonance. For each, in a way, it was the race she should have had against Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Ms. Holtzman was narrowly defeated by Mr. D'Amato in 1980 when Jacob K. Javits, the toppled Republican incumbent, persisted in seeking re-election on the Liberal line and drained liberal and Jewish votes from her.
Four years later, at the moment Ms. Ferraro, then a six-term Congresswoman from Queens, was tapped by Walter Mondale to be his Vice-Presidential running mate, Ms. Ferraro had been talked about as Mr. D'Amato's next challenger. And even if the Democratic ticket lost, she would only be helped in a Senate race, the pundits said.
 
Ms. Ferraro's Chance
 But that was before Ms. Ferraro became the first woman to be put through the fire of running on the national ticket of a major party. It was before anyone understood how a breadwinner spouse would be scrutinized and how Ms. Ferraro's campaign would be pummeled with questions about her husband's business dealings and associations.
At one point during that tormented campaign, she said, "Whatever happens in this campaign, I'm going to spend the rest of my life making it up to my husband, who I love dearly, who's a very honest man, who's put a lot of aggravation into this thing."
But eight years later, after extensive polling, she thought she and her family could withstand another barrage and that she had a strong chance to win office in a year of voter concern about the economy and women's issues, like abortion rights. She said she expected the questions of 1984 to be raised again. But not by Democrats. And not by Liz Holtzman.
And when it was Ms. Holtzman who led the barrage in order to shake Ms. Ferraro's status as a front-runner, women in the feminist movement began to turn on each other, publicly demanding whether it was somehow uncharacteristic of a feminist to fight dirty. Others retorted that this was an invidious double standard to ask a woman to fight, but not hard, not to win.
 
Holtzman as Spoiler
 For Ms. Ferraro's staff and supporters, many questions remained yesterday: Why did Ms. Holtzman go after their candidate alone, when all her campaign attacks only seemed to help Mr. Abrams? Why, at some point, didn't she subsist in the interest of electing a woman instead of Mr. Abrams?
"In the year of the woman, I want to get a woman," said Teresa Vilmaine, Ms. Ferraro's campaign manager, calling Ms. Holtzman's campaign strategy "irrational." She accused Ms. Holtzman of playing the same spoiler role against Ms. Ferraro than Mr. Javits once played against Ms. Holtzman.
Back in the City Comptroller's office, a somewhat subdued Ms. Holtzman showed no remorse for knocking out the other female candidate.
"Well, I was hoping a woman would win this race, and I was hoping it would be me," she said. "I waged a tough and hard campaign and I think it's a traditional New York campaign. I don't think we broke any new ground in that respect."
 
Koch on Holtzman
 Ms. Holtzman added: "I think to extract that somehow when a woman runs for office she is not entitled to try to win, that's real unjustifiable and unfair. I entered this race to win."
Other politicians weren't so sure that she took the right approach. "Just as Ed Koch so damaged himself in 1988 with his stridency against Jesse Jackson, I think she did it to herself now in this race," said Lawrence Mandelker, who had been the campaign treasurer to former Mayor Edward I. Koch. "I think she's going to get a primary next year and then she's going to have to argue that you've got to keep a woman as the comptroller."
Mr. Koch himself said, "I don't think she'll ever be able to run for anything other than re-election as comptroller ever again with any feeling that she's secure in the women's vote."
Ms. Ferraro was also being described in past tenses, with Ms. Pogrebin speaking bitterly of how the candidate's political career had been "destroyed."
And in Washington, the women's movement was moving on, pointing to other victors to symbolize the struggle, like Patty Murray, who in September won the Democratic nomination to run for the Senate from Washington State. "Even with this defeat we still have heroines," said Ms. Woods. "We may grieve over New York but we have other battles ready to be fought."

HEADLINE: Millicent Fenwick, 82, Dies; Gave Character to Congress

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.
She died of heart failure, her family said. 
 "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."
Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.
She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons.
 
Watchdog of Helsinki Accords
 On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.
Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.
Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.
She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet."
 
Hail and Farewell and Oink
 Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.
In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."
When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."
Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.
Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance.
 
Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg
 Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.
After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.
After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.
Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims.
 
Scandalized Her Family
 Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.
Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.
As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.
She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.
She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.
Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: In Test of G.O.P. Leader, Loyalist Wins in Nassau

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Sept. 16

 BODY:
Although shaken by a string of recent losses to Democrats, the Nassau County Republican Committee and its chairman, Joseph N. Mondello, came up big winners in Tuesday's primary.
Republican voters resisted a call for a change in party leadership and supported Mr. Mondello's candidate, David A. Levy, a Hemsptead Town Councilman and party loyalist. Mr. Levy easily won the party's nomination in the newly redrawn Fourth Congressional District, defeating an insurgent, Daniel Frisa, a four-term State Assemblyman. 
 "The media said that this was going to be a referendum on me, and so be it," Mr. Mondello said to the cheers of campaign workers as he and Mr. Levy celebrated the outcome of the race.
The lingering recession, loss of jobs and a shrinking tax base in Nassau County have led to cuts in county services and an unresolved $150 million budget gap that has prompted critics to raise questions about the Republican Party's management of county government.
Mr. Levy, 38 years old, said his victory should make future candidates think twice about challenging the Nassau G.O.P. organization. He said of Mr. Frisa, "You can lie to the people, and you can send them mail, but if you don't have the organization behind you on Election Day, there is no way you can be successful."
Unofficial returns gave Mr. Levy 12,557 votes to 9,690 for Mr. Frisa. A third candidate, Francis Lees, a 61-year-old economics professor at St. John's University in Queens, received 1,757 votes.
 
Leadership Was an Issue
 Mr. Frisa, 37, had called for new party leadership, citing heavy losses to Democratic candidates last year, particularly in the towns of Oyster Bay and North Hempstead. Those losses have undermined Republican control of the Nassau County Board of Supervisors, dominated for more than four decades by the Republican Party from its base in Hempstead.
Mr. Frisa rejected charges by Mr. Mondello and Mr. Levy that his major backer was Joseph Margiotta, the former chairman of the Nassau County Republican Committee who went to prison for 14 months after his 1982 conviction on Federal extortion and mail-fraud charges. Mr. Mondello was chosen by Mr. Margiotta to succeed him as party leader, but they have since had a falling out.
The Republican leadership's next big challenge is the general election this fall and next year's race for County Executive, when the incumbent Republican, Thomas S. Gulotta, is expected to seek re-election.
In November, Mr. Levy will face Philip Schiliro, 36, a congressional aide to Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat. Mr. Schiliro won a narrow victory over a political newcomer, Joan F. Axinn, 62, of Port Washington, in the Democratic primary in the Fourth District. Unofficial returns gave Mr. Schiliro 11,699 votes to 11,273 from Mrs. Axinn.
 
Incumbent Wins Primary
 The race for the redrawn Fourth District became wide open earlier this year when the incumbent, Raymond J. McGrath, a Republican, announced his retirement. The district stretches from East Norwich, south to Atlantic Beach, and takes in all or part of Uniondale, Roosevelt, East Meadow, North Bellmore, Valley Stream, Lynbrook, Rockville Centre, the Five Towns, North Merrick, Hempstead and North Wantagh. Republicans outnumber Democrats by nearly 2 to 1.
In the neighboring Fifth Congressional District, which includes parts of northern Queens and Nassau and Suffolk counties, five-term incumbent Gary L. Ackerman of Jamaica, Queens, won the Democratic nomination. He defeated Rita Morris, a 68-year-old librarian at Nassau Community College. Mr. Ackerman received 24,297 votes to 17,881 for Mrs. Morris.
When Mrs. Morris telephoned Mr. Ackerman at his campaign headquarters to concede, Mr. Ackerman told her that she had "run a very spirited race" and that he "admired her for the kind of effort and energy" she had put into the race.
Mr. Ackerman won with the backing of the Democratic Party leadership in Queens, Nassau and Suffolk. He said he went into the contest "in a year that promised a tremendous amount of upsets for those of us who have been in this business for a while.
"But we were able to prove some of the pundits wrong," he said, "especially those who said this was going to be the sleeper race to watch."
In November, Mr. Ackerman will face Alan Binder, a Suffolk County legislator, who was the only candidate for the Republican nomination.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: 12th District
Woman in the News;
Loyalty and Labor; Nydia M. Velazquez

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Two years ago, Nydia M. Velazquez found herself the focus of attention at festivities to celebrate the mayoral primary victory of David N. Dinkins, when she was described as the engine behind a large and ultimately crucial Hispanic voter turnout. 
 Though officially nonpartisan in her role as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's representative in New York, Ms. Velazquez solidified her reputation that night as a street-smart and politically savvy woman who understood the value of solidarity and loyalty to other politicians, community leaders and organized labor.
Since then, relations between the Mayor and some of the city's Hispanic political leaders have suffered, making such affiliations risky. But on Tuesday, Ms. Velazquez clearly played those loyalties to her own advantage in an important test of Hispanic political coming-of-age. Despite competition from four other Hispanic candidates that threatened to split the Hispanic vote, she upset an influential House veteran, Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, and virtually assured that she would become the first Hispanic woman to represent New York City in Congress.
 
'Cementing Relationships'
 "While the other candidates may have guts and talent, she went about cementing relationships with everybody," Representative Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx said yesterday. Her victory, he said, was as much a statement about her strength as a candidate as about coalition building with Mayor Dinkins and his allies, including Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan and Dennis Rivera, the head of Local 1199, the politically powerful health-care workers union, whose members were everywhere on Primary Day, boosting Ms. Velazquez at the polls.
Ms. Velazquez, running in the new 12th Congressional District drawn to concentrate Hispanic voting power, won largely because of overwhelming Hispanic support in Brooklyn and strong support from the black community. A second Hispanic candidate, Elizabeth Colon, weakened Mr. Solarz by drawing many of the white and Asian votes he needed for victory.
With her election almost certain to go unchallenged in November in the heavily Democratic district, Ms. Velazquez stands to become the second Hispanic member of the New York delegation, after Mr. Serrano. She would be the second Hispanic woman in Congress from any state, following Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican and a Cuban-American from Miami, who was first elected in 1989.
Such distinctions, however, are nothing new for Ms. Velazquez (pronounced veh-LA-skehz), who is divorced.
Born in Yabucoa, P.R., on March 28, 1953, one of nine children of a sugar cane worker and his wife, Nydia Margarita Velazquez was the first member of her family to get a high school diploma. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras in 1974, and two years later, received her master's in political science from New York University.
 
Representing Puerto Rico
 In 1984, Ms. Velazquez, at the time a special assistant to Representative Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn, became the first Hispanic woman to serve on the New York City Council after being selected to fill a vacant seat.
In 1986, Ms. Velazquez was asked to represent the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the United States, first as National Director of the Migration Division, then as the head of community affairs for Puerto Ricans living in the United States.
Though her critics wonder if her ties to Puerto Rico make her too parochial to serve the polyglot Hispanic community in New York and if her ties to Mayor Dinkins compromise her independence, her supporters praise her as a hard worker with a progressive agenda who understands poverty and other urban ills.
During her primary campaign, she promised that, if elected, she would focus on jobs, housing and education in the district and would block unwanted Federal projects and help fight against AIDS. She called for more Federal funds to increase economic developent, in part through stepped-up urban aid initiatives.
 
Known as a Protester
 Considered compulsive by friends, who say she may call in the middle of the night with ideas about how to solve particular problems, Ms. Velazquez is also known as a protester. She supported the Daily News workers during their strike -- a cause strongly supported by Mr. Rivera -- and helped take down a wall at a school in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that separated Hispanic and Hasidic children.
Though she continued to campaign with Mayor Dinkins even after he pushed plans for a new incinerator in the Brooklyn Navy Yard last month, Ms. Velazquez has testified against it before the City Council and has vowed to continue to fight it.
"For me, she has epitomized a fierce pride in self and community, a commitment to bridge the street with the corporate suite, and a tenacity in leading movements," said Luis Garden-Acosta, chief executive of El Puente, a Hispanic community organization in Williamsburg. "She's a fighter."
Ms. Velazquez's triumph on Tuesday was also seen as a significant victory for Mayor Dinkins, as Mr. Solarz and her other opponents drew backing from the Mayor's political rivals, including Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx and two likely mayoral challengers, Rudolph W. Giuliani and City Council President Andrew J. Stein.
As she thanked voters at a subway stop in Bedford-Stuyvesant yesterday afternoon, Ms. Velazquez attributed her victory to the get-out-the-vote efforts of more than 500 members of Local 1199 and of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and to the endorsements of Mr. Dinkins and others. "This campaign was based on a coalition," she said.

HEADLINE: Democrats on Senate Panel Attack the Free-Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Using the conservation provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement as a political cudgel, Congressional Democrats pressed their attacks on the pact today, accusing the White House of negotiating an accord that could damage the environment and cause thousands of American jobs to be shifted to Mexico.
During the Senate Finance Committee hearing, John Danforth of Missouri was the only Republican lawmaker who strongly defended the agreement, chiding his Democratic colleagues for "using environmental and health standards as a guise for protectionism." 
 The United States, Mexico and Canada completed the agreement last month, and in the days since, Democrats have questioned how it might affect the environment, American wages, factory workers, and growers of fruit, vegetables and grain.
 
Criticism of the Negotiators
 Democratic lawmakers from the South, the Middle West and the Great Plains cited concerns their constituents have raised about the agreement. These senators -- John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota -- asserted that the Bush Administration had not worked hard enough to obtain tough measures that would prevent companies from exploiting weak enforcement of environmental laws in Mexico to gain a competitive advantage.
Senator Max S. Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance subcommittee on international trade, called for the Administration to reopen talks to strengthen the environmental provisions.
"The main reason that the Bush Administration chose not to adequately address the environmental issues in the North American Free Trade Agreement," Mr. Baucus said, "was that the growing tension between environmental and trade issues had never before been addressed. The Administration was timid in the face of the new challenge."
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, assumed a surprisingly small role today, in contrast to two previous hearings in which Mr. Bentsen had been the committee's most aggressive questioner. He appeared for just a few minutes to make an informal statement and then issued a prepared statement in which he seemed to endorse the agreement's environmental provisions.
 
Defense by the E.P.A.
 In his second consecutive day of Congressional testimony, William K. Reilly commended the agreement as the "greenest" trade pact ever negotiated. Mr. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said today that the accord would over all be a bonus for the environment by encouraging the development of more wealth in Mexico, giving the nation the money to monitor and enforce its environmental laws.
But Mr. Reilly also seemed to confirm Mr. Baucus's assertion. He said the accord's environmental protections were a new legal and diplomatic frontier that had presented the negotiators with challenges they could not solve.
Mr. Reilly said more specific protections had been considered, including provisions allowing countries to issue sanctions against products to prevent excessive pollution during their manufacture. But negotiators were unable to work out language for how such provisions might work.

HEADLINE: Managed Care Is More of What We Have Now

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Half Right on Health" (editorial, Aug. 31) favors the so-called "Jackson Hole global budget" -- referring to the health-care experts who invented the term for a system that sets "only the premium that providers would be allowed to charge for basic coverage" and remove incentives for "unnecessary services." This plan is a thinly disguised attempt to consolidate control of the country's sickness-care industry among those few health insurers who promote health maintenance organizations. It is not health care reform. 
 If Gov. Bill Clinton is serious about being the candidate of change, and if, as the polls indicate, health care is a major concern of the American people, he will be well advised to avoid burdening American business with the cost of dealing with the nationalized or regionalized H.M.O.'s proposed at Jackson Hole.
H.M.O.'s are no-change economic medicine: In an age of global competition, they perpetuate the archaic system that forces employers to add health-care costs to their products and pensions. Barely a day passes without a major corporation announcing cuts in benefits for employees and retirees. An economic program that creates jobs for Americans will relieve American industry of this expense and help make us competitive with the rest of the world.
H.M.O.'s are no-change social medicine: Adoption of a managed-care plan, rather than promoting the general welfare, would increase the separation between the haves and have-nots by maintaining a multitiered system. There is no good reason for the United States to be the only major country with different health benefits for people who work in major companies, those in small companies, the self-employed, the unemployed, the underemployed and the government-employed.
H.M.O.'s are no-change political medicine: By pandering to the health-insurance lobby, the managed-care proposals will perpetuate a system that costs each American twice as much as each of our Canadian neighbors before we have to pay for the 40 million among us who have no coverage. Any candidate serious about the health-care system will recognize the value of a plan that insures everyone at half the costs of ours.
Adoption of the Jackson Hole proposals would force Americans to swallow some new medicine by removing the choice of physician for most Americans and straining physician-patient relationships; by increasing tax advantages to the insurance industry; by expanding Medicaid costs; by creating administrative nightmares through contrived programs that require each patient to be formally qualified, and of course by relieving physicians of the responsibility for choosing medical procedures by turning that function over to an insurance carrier.
Governor Clinton is well advised to avoid jumping on the Jackson Hole bandwagon. "Save the H.M.O. industry" is hardly a popular or useful battle cry.

HEADLINE: Halt the Verbal Abuse Of 'Special Interests'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In this campaign season, everyone -- especially Christoper Georges in "The Clinton Plan (Thanks to Dukakis)" (Op-Ed, Aug. 24) -- talks about special-interest groups, but nobody defines them. 
 The concept of special interests is a leftover from a time when a clear majority of Americans (and people in other countries as well) depended directly or indirectly on the land for their livelihoods. Anyone not so dependent could legitimately be described as representing an economic special interest, because his or her economic interests differed from the clear majority of the population.
Nowadays, people make their livings from all kinds of sources, and therefore everybody belongs to one or more economic interest groups, all of which are more or less equally special. (Some are, by percentage, slightly less special -- that is, bigger -- than others, but none command a majority or anything close to one.) When Americans today talk about "special interests," they mean those they don't share or approve of.
A moratorium on "special-interest" rhetoric should be declared for the duration of this electoral campaign.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN EUROPE;
EUROPEANS' CURRENCY SYSTEM SHAKEN AS BRITAIN CUTS FREE

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Thursday, Sept. 17

 BODY:
After a futile day of trying to defend the value of the pound, Britain dropped out of the European Monetary System on Wednesday, at least temporarily. Its departure from the monetary system, a cornerstone of greater European unity, left the program of economic coordination in tatters.
Before taking that unexpected step, which effectively allowed the pound to drop sharply in value, Britain desperately tried to pump up the currency. First it raised one of its key interest rates to 12 percent from 10 percent. Only hours later -- after the pound had sunk still further -- it announced another increase, to 15 percent. By raising rates so sharply, Britain hoped to make the pound more attractive to investors and stop concerted selling by speculators that was pushing it down. 
 Early this morning in Brussels, finance officials from the 12 European Community nations attempted to restore some order to the chaotic currency markets by devaluing the Spanish peseta by 5 percent and allowing the Italian lira to fall freely. The lira had been devalued 7 percent on Sunday.
 
Currency Restrictions
 Like the other European members of the monetary system, Britain has been obliged to keep its currency within certain bounds relative to other currencies -- and particularly the German mark, the strongest of the group. It was the pound's decline below that limit on Wednesday that forced Britain's costly measures: first to bolster the pound, then to pull out of the system altogether.
The situation prompted only mild concern outside Europe. United States officials said the turbulence could actually benefit European and American economies, leading to lower interest rates that would spur growth in Europe and eventually give the United States a lift.
While Britain's decision to depart, at least temporarily, from the monetary system raised problems for Britain's allies, it also created a political crisis for Prime Minister John Major. While Margaret Thatcher had only reluctantly agreed to greater integration with the rest of Europe, Mr. Major embraced the prospect. He has staked the credibility of his Government on maintaining the pound's value at almost any cost, as a willing participant in the monetary system. [Page D9.]
 
New Questions for Europe
 And with France set to vote on Sunday on whether to approve the treaty outlining the next stages of European unification, the shift by Britain raised new questions about whether Europe can or should continue its push for monetary union.
The British move came at the end of a day in which speculators sold huge amounts of Europe's weaker currencies, including the pound, the lira and the peseta, and plowed funds into the German mark, traditionally the strongest and most stable currencies. The shifts threw out of whack Europe's strategy for closer economic ties.
As Britain raced to defend the pound on Wednesday, Italy and Sweden were also struggling to maintain their own weak currencies.
Italy spent large sums selling marks and other currencies in return for lira in an attempt to bid up the lira's value. Sweden, which is not yet a member of the European Community but is trying to get its finances in order in preparation for joining, pushed the rate for its most expensive loans to banks to an almost unheard of 500 percent.
But in the face of the overwhelming movement of funds out of the weak currencies, even those strategies accomplished little. As the pound slipped, so did the lira, despite having already been devalued by 7 percent. And from London to New York, the markets degenerated into something akin to a feeding frenzy, with speculators convinced they could profit by pushing the mark higher.
"The markets have become a monster, and the reason is the disastrous mistake of devaluing the lira," said William Ledward, an economist at Nomura Securities International in London. "In agreeing to a 7 percent devaluation, you gave the speculators a big profit, and these people are like vampires. Once they taste blood, they have to have it again."
In Brussels, the European Community's monetary committee convened shortly before midnight Wednesdya in an emergency session called by the British.
Six hours later, representatives of the central banks and finance ministries of the European Community nations issued a communique noting the British decision to pull out of the European Monetary System and a subsequent move by the Italian authorities to allowing the lira to fall freely rather than be supported by government intervention. They then disclosed the 5 percent devaluation of the Spanish peseta within the exchange rate system.
The actions mean that the German mark and its closely associated currencies, like the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder, will be stronger within what remains of the exchange-rate system while the weaker currencies, which had been under heavy speculative pressure, would lose weight.
In their communique, the finance officials tried to put the best face on the proceedings by saying that Britain and Italy had stressed "their unanimous commitment to the European Monetary System as a key factor of economic stability and prosperity in Europe."
They urged a return of the pound and the lira to the exchange rate system "as soon as possible."
 
Little Choice for Major
 While detaching the pound from the other European currencies and letting it drift lower was an outright reversal of his stance -- as well as an unpopular step that would increase the cost of Britain's imports -- Mr. Major had little choice. Politically and economically, he was unable to raise interest rates any higher. Higher rates will be poison for Britain, already in the grip of recession. And the country was running out of foreign currency reserves to defend the pound. This evening, he gave in to the markets.
The reversal came in the form of a decision to withdraw from the agreement among 11 of the 12 European Community nations to keep currency values within a relatively narrow range. Instead, the Government said, it would allow the pound to float freely, its value set by market forces.
The decision was tantamount to a large devaluation, a step that both Mr. Major and Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had repeatedly ruled out. Soon after the announcement tonight, the pound was trading at 2.70 German marks, far below its lower limit under the European exchange rate mechanism of 2.778 marks.
"What was supposed to be the centerpiece of the Government's economic policy has been removed at a stroke and Britain, having wanted to be at the heart of the new Europe, is now thrown off again to the periphery," said Nigel Gault, the chief European economist in London for DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm.
Theo Waigel, the German Finance Minister, said he thought Britain would soon rejoin the monetary system and that there would not be a devaluation of any other currencies.
But there were clearly strains within the European Community over Britain's decision. British officials openly criticized Helmut Schlesinger, the head of the powerful German central bank, the Bundesbank, for reportedly suggesting in an interview on Tuesday that he favored further revaluations with the exchange rate agreement. Although Mr. Schlesinger said he never made the remarks, currency traders took the reports as a signal that the Bundesbank would not act to halt a slide in the pound or the lira by cutting interest rates. The Bundesbank cut rates slightly on Monday in a failed attempt to stabilize the currency markets.
Sir Norman Fowler, the chairman of Britain's governing Conservative Party, said, "The fact is that the turmoil on the foreign exchanges has been caused by the uncertainty over the French referendum result and unnecessarily by the Bundesbank president's remarks."
The Spanish and Portuguese currencies are expected to come under severe pressure today, as will the currencies of nations like Sweden that are likely to become European Community members within a few years. Analysts said that if there were wholesale readjustments in the values of currencies to each other beyond the bounds now called for, the credibility of the exchange rate system would be seriously wounded.
At best, they said, it would be a long time before the currency markets took the commitment to stable exchange rates seriously even if France approves the unification treaty on Sunday.
"The very existence of the European Monetary System is in doubt," Mr. Ledward of Nomura Securities said.
 
Two-Tiered System?
 Some analysts, however, predicted that the process of unification might now proceed on a two-tiered basis, with Germany, France and a handful of other nations moving toward a single currency and monetary policy, while others, including Britain, watch from the sidelines.
Devaluation makes one nation's currency worth less in relation to that of another nation. The process has certain advantages, including making a nation's exports less expensive, and therefore more desirable. But it tends to cause inflation because it makes imports more expensive and because it leads investors, wary of further devaluations, to demand higher interest rates.
The devaluation of the pound does not eliminate the basic pressures that set off the currency speculation. Interest rates in Germany remain at very high levels, making the mark attractive. Rates in Germany are high because the Bundesbank is fearful that the higher-than-expected costs of reuniting East and West Germany will ignite inflation, and because higher rates attract the capital that Germany needs to fund the reunification.
At the same time, the world's other major currency, the dollar, remains relatively weak because interest rates in the United States are at their lowest point in decades, making investments in dollars relatively unappealing. The United States is more insulated from other currency moves because it imports considerably less than the nations of Europe, and because oil, a critical import, is priced in dollars.
The uncertainty over the outcome of Sunday's vote in France on the Maastricht treaty outlining the course of further European unification has only hurt the situation. Investors are fearful that French rejection of the treaty would end efforts at monetary union.
Without the goal of monetary union to motivate them, some nations might choose to abandon the exchange-rate ties and the need to maintain fiscal and monetary discipline that goes along with them. Without that discipline, the investors fear, nations like Britain might once again pursue inflationary policies, making their currencies less valuable.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 18, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday showing changes in European currency exchange rates included an erroneous label. The scale for Italy showed German marks per 1,000 lire, not for 1 lira.


GRAPHIC: 1. Worried by Danish rejection of the European unification treaty in June, investors began favoring the German currency, the Deutsche mark, over the British pound, causing the mark to gain in value and the pound to lose value.
Chart: "The Pound's Struggle With the Deutsche Mark"
 2. The decline of the pound accelerated after the German central bank raised interest rates in July. Other weak currencies like the Italian lira also lost value against the mark.
 3. Under diplomatic pressure from its neighbors, Germany cut interest rates slightly on Monday, but the effect was short lived. By late Tuesday, the pound bought less than 2.778 marks, the minimum value Britain is required to maintain in the European monetary system.
 4. To attract investors and pump up the pound's value, Britain raised its benchmark interest rate from 10 percent to 12 percent yesterday morning. The pound's value did not respond as hoped.
 5. In the afternoon, Britain raised its interest rates even further, to 15 percent. But even this extraordinary increase was not enough to stop the pound from sliding further.
 6. Aware of the devastating effect soaring interest rates would have on its economy, the British Government abandoned its effort to support the pound and withdrew from the European currency agreement, at least temporarily. (pg. A1)
 
Graphs: "How All the Excitement Started" tracks value of marks per markka, krona, lira, and pound since September 2. Also tracked are interest rates in Sweden, Germany, and Britain over the same period.
 1. Finland says it will let the markka fluctuate against other currencies, effectively devaluing it.
 2. The Swedish krona falls, reacting to the Finns' move. The Swedes begin a series of sharp interest rate increases.
 3. Italy devalues the lira, as the German Bundesbank cuts interest rates in a futile effort to stablize currency markets.
 4. Sweden raises its' base lending rate to 500 percent, from 75 percent.
5. The Bank of England raises its base lending rate, but the pound still falls. It then pulls out of the exchange rate mechanism, and lowers the interest rate. (pg. D8)

HEADLINE: Executives Urge Focus On Deficit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
A group of business executives and academic leaders chided the two Presidential candidates today for failing to make substantial proposals to cut the budget deficit and said tax increases would probably be necessary.
The group, headed by A. W. Clausen, chairman of the executive committee of BankAmerica's board, urged the Government to eliminate the deficit in five to ten years, saying the United States had to nurse its economy back to health to strengthen its world leadership role. 
 The group, the Council for Economic Development, said slashing the deficit "should be the highest domestic economic priority." It said the deficit had helped reduce the nation's savings rate to a paltry 2 percent and was limiting the amount of money available for the private investment needed to make the economy more competitive.
"The United States should get its own house in order by eliminating the structural deficit within the next decade and cutting its savings rate to 8 percent," Mr. Clausen said.
 
Importance of Tax Increases
 The committee said deficit reduction should focus on cutting spending, looking especially at military expenditures, but also pointed to the importance of tax increases. The report said "carefully designed tax increases that do not discourage private saving and investment will do less harm to the economy than persistent" deficits.
During a news conference today in Washington, committee members said President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had not addressed deficit reduction seriously.
The committee includes Harold A. Poling, chairman of Ford Motor; Richard D. Wood, chairman of Eli Lilly; Robert C. Winters, chairman of Prudential Insurance; James J. Renier, chairman of Honeywell; Owen B. Butler, retired chairman of Procter & Gamble; Donna E. Shalala, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Arnold R. Weber, president of Northwestern University.
Calling for a consumption tax, Mr. Clausen said taxes that discouraged investment would be unwise.
'We need government policies that provide a more appropriate environment for investing in the future," he said. "The U.S. consumes far more of what it creates than other major industrial countries and reinvests less than 5 percent in our future. Other countries -- Germany and Japan -- are consuming far less of what they create and investing a lot more in their future."
 
Role of World Leader
 Urging the nation not to shirk its international responsibilities in this time of economic troubles, the business group said the United States was the only nation that could play the role of world leader to foster international cooperation to promote growth and security.
"We need to become a rallier of nations, a catalyst helping to define international priorities and motivating cooperative action," Mr. Clausen said. "In this new world, only the United States has the unique mix of attributes -- economic power, military might, political dexterity and moral stature -- necessary to lead."
To strengthen America's position as world leader, the report said Washington should increase foreign aid outlays, continue pushing to eliminate trade barriers and honor its monetary commitments to the United Nations and other international organizations. The report urged Washington to move the issue of family planning back onto the international agenda because fast population growth slows per-capita income growth in many developing nations.
The report made numerous proposals to improve America's competitiveness, calling for education reform, increased Federal support for business investment in training, and removing regulations that discourage joint research.
Leonard Silk, a former economics columnist for The New York Times, was the chief author of the report.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Florida Poll;
Florida Emerges As Crucial State In the Campaign

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 16

 BODY:
After voting Republican in every Presidential election but one over the last 40 years, Florida has emerged as an unexpected battleground in the race between President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton, according to new polls.
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, taken Thursday through Monday, gave Mr. Clinton a slim advantage in Florida, 48 percent to 42 percent, with 10 percent undecided. Another poll, published today in The Miami Herald, gave Mr. Bush a slight advantage, 48 percent to 41 percent, with 11 percent undecided. 
 Given the margins of sampling error in the two polls, the state and its 25 electoral votes, viewed by Republican strategists as essential to the President's re-election, are plainly up for grabs.
 
Rating on Storm Relief
 The Times/CBS News survey in Florida, the nation's fourth most populous state, showed that while a majority of those polled approved of Mr. Bush's handling of the crisis after Hurricane Andrew, the President got little political benefit from his actions in the storm's aftermath and his decision to support the rebuilding of Homestead Air Force Base at an estimated cost of nearly $500 million.
Over all, 61 percent of Florida residents interviewed for the poll, and 65 percent of those in Dade County, which bore the brunt of the most expensive natural disaster in American history, said they approved of Mr. Bush's handling of the hurricane crisis. But only 40 percent described the Federal response as "adequate" and 62 percent said the response should have been faster.
 
Complaints About Economy
 The survey indicated that Mr. Bush's high marks for his handling of the hurricane were severely undercut by dissatisfaction with his management of the nation's economy. More than 70 percent of those polled said they disapproved of his handling of economic matters, which most of those polled said ought to be the issue that the Presidential candidates talk about most.
"Well, I lost two jobs during the last two years, and I directly relate that to Mr. Bush," said Elizabeth White, an unemployed 35-year-old Clinton supporter from the Miami suburb of Kendall. "Because the economy is so bad around here, my job was eliminated."
Even the President's supporters faulted him on economic issues. Juan Boitel, a 51-year-old maitre d'hotel, said he would vote for Mr. Bush "because of the way he has handled international politics, especially the way he took care of Saddam Hussein," but he described the economic situation as "terrible."
"There's no money in the streets anymore," Mr. Boitel said. "The restaurants are empty, the unemployment rate is high and people are not buying cars and clothing like they used to."
 
Race Is Dead Heat
 The Times/CBS News survey is based on 1,112 telephone and face-to-face interviews with adult Florida residents, including 785 who said they were registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points, meaning that the race in Florida is a statistical dead heat.
To compare the Miami area with the rest of the state, 355 interviews were conducted in Dade County, of which 270 were face to face because of hurricane damage to many individual homes and to the telephone system.
The Miami Herald poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research Inc., was based on telephone interviews with 804 registered voters and has a margin of sampling error of between three and four percentage points. While it showed Mr. Bush with a slight lead, in statistical terms the race was a tossup.
Since President Harry S. Truman carried Florida in 1948, no Democratic Presidential nominee except Jimmy Carter in 1976 has won the state, and Mr. Carter was Governor of neighboring Georgia at the time. The Bush campaign attaches so much importance to keeping Florida in the Republican column that the President's son, Jeb Bush, is chairman of the statewide campaign.
"Intuitively, I think we are ahead and in a close race," Jeb Bush said today when asked to comment on the poll results. "That's my own feeling, but how does one really know? The good news for us is that our Republican base is back and we're doing well in conservative Democratic areas, and that is enough to win in this state."
"It doesn't matter what Bill Clinton does," the younger Mr. Bush added, because "we are going to use phones, mail and door-to-door to turn people out."
It appears, however, that the President will face a race down to the wire, requiring a substantial commitment of time, money and campaign workers to a state he won by nearly a million votes in 1988.
Nationwide, according to the Times/ CBS News poll, Mr. Clinton has the backing of 49 percent of the voters, compared with 37 percent who say they support Mr. Bush.
The President's support appears firmer in Florida than nationwide. Only 35 percent of his supporters here say they harbor reservations about Mr. Bush, compared with 44 percent of those in the national sample.
"Clinton refused to go to war," said Adelfa Braker, 58, "and he doesn't know what it means to fire a shot, so I could never vote for him."
"President Bush has done so much for this country, even though his hands are tied by Congress," added Ms. Braker, who operates a small apparel business from her home, "but many people simply refuse to see this."
But in a state where questions of foreign policy, particularly toward Cuba, Israel and Haiti, are often indistinguishable from local affairs, Mr. Bush has derived no extra benefit from his tough stance against President Fidel Castro of Cuba and Haitian boat people. Approval of his handling of foreign affairs is virtually the same here, 58 percent, as in the nation as a whole.
In some other respects, Florida residents have a more favorable image of Mr. Bush than is the case elsewhere in the country, and that gives the Bush campaign a base upon which to build.
Nationwide, 44 percent of registered voters polled said they thought the President "cares about the needs and problems of people" like them. But in Florida, half the respondents said they thought Mr. Bush cared.
For Mr. Clinton, 67 percent of the nationwide sample said they thought he cared about their problems, as against 62 percent in Florida.
Republicans can also find encouragement in voter sentiment in favor of their party's candidates for the House of Representatives in a state whose House delegation rises by four seats, to 23, next January as a result of population gains in the 1990 census. Nationally, voters favor Democrats over Republicans by 10 percentage points, but here the two parties are in a dead heat.
The poll indicates that blame for the perceived slowness and inefficiency of the hurricane relief effort has fallen not on Mr. Bush, who made two trips to Dade County after the storm, but on the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose performance was described as adequate by only 31 percent of Floridians. Insurance companies were also widely criticized, with only 32 percent of those polled saying that the industry's response was adequate.
The military's work after the hurricane won the approval of 92 percent of Dade County respondents and 83 percent of those statewide. The performance of Florida's state government, which is controlled by Democrats, was considered to be better than the Federal Government's, with 39 percent of those polled saying the state's response was adequate.
Seventy-five percent of the registered voters in Dade County, and 82 percent of those statewide, said Mr. Bush's actions after the storm would not affect their vote in November.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 19, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the standings of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton in the latest public opinion polls in Florida misstated the state's voting record in Presidential elections. Democrats have won the state twice in the last 40 years. President Johnson carried Florida in 1964, and so did Jimmy Carter in 1976.

How the 2 Polls Were Conducted
 The latest nationwide New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 9 through 13 with 1,329 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, of whom 1,006 said they were registered voters.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers.
In addition, interviews in Florida were conducted Sept. 10 through 14 with 1,112 adults, of whom 785 said they were registered voters. So that residents of Dade County could be compared with the rest of the state, 355 interviews were conducted there; because of hurricane damage to homes and the local telephone system, 270 of these interviews were conducted in person. The results were then adjusted to reflect Dade County's share of Florida's population. Respondents were interviewed in English or Spanish.
The sample of Florida telephone numbers was provided by Survey Sampling Inc. of Fairfield, Conn. The in-person interviews were conducted by Belden and Russonello Inc. of Washington in 31 locations in Dade County.
For both polls, within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations relating to region, race, sex, and age. The national poll was also weighted by education.
In theory, in 19 of 20 cases the results based on such samples will differ by no more than a few percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all registered voters in the population. For the national poll it is plus or minus three points; for the Florida poll it is plus or minus four points.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for residents of Dade County it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. (pg. A20)

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Connecticut;
Johnson Begins Uphill Struggle vs. Dodd

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Sept. 16

 BODY:
Brook Johnson, a Greenwich millionaire, opened his general-election drive for the United States Senate today after a victorious Republican primary campaign built around generous financing and calculated spending on television commercials.
Mr. Johnson, a political newcomer who reported an income of $2.4 million last year as chairman of a towel and bedding company, spent $900,000, compared with about $500,000 by his rival for the nomination, State Representative Chris Burnham, who had received the party endorsement. Commercials for Mr. Johnson crowded the airwaves in this small state, while Mr. Burnham, who held similar positions on many issues, did not run a single television ad. 
 Mr. Johnson defeated Mr. Burnham 59 percent to 41 percent, with pluralities in blue-collar cities as well as Republican strongholds like Greenwich and New Canaan.
 
The Role of TV
 Television advertising made the big difference, in the view of Dr. Everett C. Ladd, executive director and president of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of Connecticut.
"Here was a race in which almost nobody was listening," Dr. Ladd said. "You had two candidates, both largely unknown as far as the state electorate is concerned, with no previous experience at anything approaching the level of the United States Senate. Those candidates find an enormous difficulty breaking through and getting any recognition from a significant portion of the electorate, so any advantage in securing recognition can be rather important."
Television advertising offered an advantage to Mr. Johnson, Dr. Ladd said. "It was enough in the context of this kind of race," he said, "but the fundamentals of the Republican side of this election look the same as they did a month ago."
 
Dodd Ahead in Polls
 Polls conducted by the center's Institute for Social Inquiry have consistently shown the incumbent, Christopher J. Dodd, far ahead of both Republicans.
The Republican choices appealed to different voters for different reasons. Mr. Burnham "seemed like an honest guy who would try to help the people, versus the polished, packaged look of Brook," said Georgia Siomkos, a corporate recruiter here who voted for Mr. Burnham but now plans to support his rival. Her husband, Michael Caradimitropoulo, voted for Mr. Johnson, whom he had followed in newspaper articles about the race, because, he said, "He's an outsider, he's independently wealthy, and he's not out there to rip off the people."
But such opinions may have had less impact than the very low voter turnout. Only about 100,000 Republicans cast ballots, out of a total of 461,000. In Waterbury, for example, only 1,495 Republicans voted in a city where there are more than 10,500 Republicans registered, giving the race to Mr. Johnson, 894-601.
Mark Rivers, Mr. Johnson's campaign director, said the credit given to television for the victory overlooked other aspects of the campaign.
 
'Grass-Roots Support'
 "We've got vast grass-roots support," he said. "The media made an impact because it got Brook Johnson's message out, about reforming Congress and the economy. But we've also got small towns where a real-estate office was converted into a phone bank, and that doesn't have a lot to do with TV ads."
Mr. Burnham, who plans to return to work on Thursday as a public-finance specialist at an investment bank, said he planned to urge all his supporters to help elect Mr. Johnson. As for how his campaign succeeded or failed, he noted that until late this spring, he was running against Robert G. Jaekle, a longtime state legislator, who dropped out of the race in June and swung his support to Mr. Johnson. "We did beat him, not knowing Brook would get into the race," he said.
Today Mr. Johnson was darting around the Hartford area, making appearances at campaign stops as well as at a unity rally for winners and losers backed by his party. Mr. Burnham said he was looking forward to resuming a normal life after the frequent long days that the Senate campaign required. He is even looking forward to commuting between Stamford and Manhattan. "I'll be on the 7 o'clock train tomorrow morning," he said.

HEADLINE: Hugo's 3-Year Wake: Lessons of a Hurricane

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: McCLELLANVILLE, S.C.

 BODY:
Three years after Hurricane Hugo's screaming winds and 17-foot storm surge left this town torn to pieces and buried under five feet of water and mud, life here seems almost back to normal, right down to the regrown Spanish moss hanging from the oak trees on Pinkney Street.
But for hurricane-ravaged residents of South Florida, Louisiana and Hawaii starting to rebuild their lives, a journey along the South Carolina coast and into the rural hamlets ravaged by Hugo provides a complicated picture of equal parts loss and renewal. Like McClellanville, South Carolina has recovered sooner than many thought possible, but its experience is a vivid lesson both in how much man can and cannot do to repair a world that nature blew apart. 
 Three years after what was the costliest storm in American history -- Hurricane Andrew, which struck South Florida and Louisiana last month, has since passed it -- South Carolina still is full of harsh reminders of Hugo's fury. They include the ghostly, denuded remains of what used to be the lush Francis Marion National Forest, the demons haunting children like Matthew Mable of Summerville who are terrified whenever a stiff wind blows, and the quiet despair of the rural poor like Viola Reed of South Santee who are still waiting to get their houses repaired so they can return home.
There are also harsh memories of the faltering Federal relief effort after Hugo, and an often-voiced resentment about the billions of dollars in election-year aid being rushed to Florida, Louisiana and Hawaii, as opposed to the $500 million spent in South Carolina at a time when no Presidential election was pending.
An economic analysis of the storm indicates that despite the rebuilding boom it brought, the storm overall was a severe economic drain on the state.
Still, South Carolina is the scene of remarkable recovery from the pastel town houses of Charleston, to the working-class trailer parks in Copahee to the rebuilt seaside communities like Pawleys Island and Folly Beach, where homes wrecked by the storm were not just rebuilt but improved so much that people on Pawleys Island, who used to playfully bill the town as "arrogantly shabby," now say they are still arrogant but no longer shabby.
To some the recovery is the most telling lesson to come out of Hugo.
"I would say the state's recovery from Hugo has been nothing short of miraculous," said Luther F. Carter, executive director of the South Carolina Budget and Control Board.
 
Estimate of $6 Billion Toll
 Still, interviews along the coast made it clear that how people recovered from the storm had a lot to do with their financial circumstances before it hit. Many of the poor took hits they may never recover from. Many of those better off were cushioned by insurance that allowed them to replace homes with more modern ones.
Everyone who was here after Hugo roared ashore on Sept. 22, 1989, can identify with those trying to rebuild after Andrew and Hurricane Iniki, which ravaged the Hawaiian island of Kauai last week.
"I remember flying the coastline right after the storm, looking down on Charleston and thinking, 'Will we ever recover?' " Mr. Carter said.
Economists are still poring over the storm's ultimate toll, a job made difficult by the fact that the devastation was followed by a huge influx of aid and a construction boom.
Douglas P. Woodward, a University of South Carolina economist who has analyzed the storm's economic impact, said the storm did $6 billion in damage, about half of it in real estate and half in natural resources, particularly timber. Of that only half was reimbursed from any source. It also created a building boom that over two-and-a-half years created about $500 million in added income, enough to forestall the recession's arrival in South Carolina for more than a year.
"It was a net economic loss to the state, which may seem obvious, but you'd be surprised how many thought for a time it might be good for the economy," Professor Woodward said. "Eventually, the artificial boom ended, and when the recession came, it was like a cold bath. In the end it was the poor who really got hurt, and a lot of them are hurting still."
There are poor people in Charleston whose homes have never been repaired from the storm, but the worst toll can be found in hundreds of rural communities that were poor before the storm and poorer now.
Miriam Green, who heads the rural Berkeley County Electric Cooperative's project to deal with housing problems left behind by Hugo, is still working to get aid to people like Mrs. Reed, a 71-year-old widow, whose house is still an uninhabitable morass of broken sheetrock and pools of water, and James Vanderhorst, a 74-year-old widower here, who was victimized by a shoddy contractor and left with a house jacked up on cinder blocks, but not high enough to meet local codes.
But just as common are stories of remarkable renewal. To this day, Lloyd McClellan and her husband, James McClellan, are amazed at the volunteers who rebuilt their home that was inundated by the storm.
"You see on television about babies starving and people firing bombs at each other in the streets, and think how lucky we are to be in a country where when you need help, people come and help," Mrs. McClellan said.
Still, even many of those whose lives seem back to normal are still carrying heavy financial burdens.
"I tried to get assistance from the Small Business Administration and got nothing," said Buster Brown who owns one grocery store here. Largely uninsured at the time of the storm, he estimates he lost $200,000 on his home and business.
But Professor Woodward's study found that while only 45 percent of residential losses were covered by insurance, about 80 percent of business and commercial losses were covered.
And, particularly near the waterfront, many people are now living better than they were before the storm because insurance payments allowed them to rebuild seaside homes into more modern structures that have higher building standards.
To some experts on coastal development property, there is no small bit of folly beneath the renaissance here.
Peter Sparks, an engineering professor at Clemson University, said many structures were hurriedly rebuilt with roofs less able to withstand a storm than they were before Hugo. In addition, new flood insurance regulations that require buildings in flood-prone areas to be at least eight feet off the ground have left a slew of trailer homes sitting on eight-foot concrete blocks, more vulnerable to hurricane winds than they were before.
"I wouldn't want to be in one of those things in a thunderstorm, Mr. Sparks said. "Overall, Hugo was a warning unheeded."
But homeowners say many beachfront homes have been rebuilt to standards that far exceed the ones they replaced. And in places like Folly Beach, where the waves almost lap at the front porches of beachfront houses, it is clear one thing that was not altered by Hugo was the desire of people to live by the shore. In fact, the city is spending $16 million -- 85 percent of it in Federal money -- on a beach renourishment project that will create 150 feet of beach at high tide.
Overlooking the ocean at the home he rebuilt, James Kennedy readily acknowledges that Folly's shifting sand may well be the kind of place that should not be built on.
But having said that, he adds that he never gave a thought to not rebuilding, especially when insurance paid for everything but his $20,000 seawall.
Josephine Humphreys, the Charleston novelist, is aware of many changes that linger after Hugo. She misses the endearing shabbiness of old Charleston blown away and replaced by something more sanitized.
She is also aware of the haunting, indelible memory of the wind that will haunt so many lives from here to Homestead, Fla., and from the bayous of Louisiana to the beaches of Hawaii.
"If you've ever been in a car wreck, you remember the sound of it for years and years and it just gives you the creeps," she said. "That's how I feel about the wind now, the sound of wind. It was just terrifying, and it's something you don't forget."

HEADLINE: Zuckerman Seems Clear Choice to Buy Daily News

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the New York real-estate developer and owner of U.S. News & World Report, yesterday became all but assured of acquiring the bankrupt Daily News.
Mr. Zuckerman has still not reached agreement with the paper's creditors or with the Newspaper Guild, which represents news, advertising and clerical workers. But the paper's board endorsed his proposal late Wednesday night and, as dawn broke yesterday, the negotiating logjam with the guild was cleared away. A final understanding will probably not be reached until next week. 
 With the endorsement by the newspaper's board and the unions, including tacit approval from the guild, many of those in the negotiations said it was highly unlikely that anything could derail Mr. Zuckerman's bid to acquire The Daily News.
"I would say that Mort Zuckerman is the new owner of The Daily News," said George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella union organization.
And James P. Willse, editor and publisher of The News, said, "As far as we're concerned, it's done."
For the beleaguered Daily News, the selection of Mr. Zuckerman would be expected to end the tremendous anxiety about the paper's fate and raise the curtain on an era of rebuilding after a disastrous strike two years ago and the unexpected death last year of Robert Maxwell, the paper's owner, whose economic collapse pushed The News into bankruptcy.
The proposed deal would mean a new color printing plant for The News and a wealthy buyer who could afford to finance future growth.. In exchange, the unions would give Mr. Zuckerman significant work-force reductions, and he would invest very little of his own cash to purchase the paper.
 
Further Staffing Cuts
 Mr. Zuckerman's deal will eventually reduce The News's work force, which was already cut when Mr. Maxwell acquired the paper, by 25 percent more, but most of that will come after the new color plant is built in two years.
The arrangement gives Mr. Zuckerman the incentive to build the plant and gives the unions more assurance that such a plant, which is considered essential to The News's longterm survival, will be built.
Mr. Zuckerman offered few specific plans for the paper yesterday, but said he wanted to strengthen its investigative reporting and "make it into a vibrant, energetic, populist, popular newspaper -- the pulse and heartbeat of New York City."
He said that by making such improvements as introducing more color and better reporting to the paper, he expected circulation and advertising to grow.
During the strike two years ago, The News's daily circulation dropped to about 300,000 from 1.2 million. Though the paper has rebounded since then to about 750,000, its future depends on broadening its readership and advertising base.
Mr. Zuckerman, who is 55 years old, yesterday characterized the status of the deal more cautiously than Mr. McDonald and Mr. Willse, recognizing the remaining issues and the reality that in a bankruptcy sale the unexpected can happen.
 
Uncertain Value of Offer
 "We're within the 10-yard line with a first down," he said.
The value of Mr. Zuckerman's offer is still undetermined. He has said that he hopes to have a new color printing plant in operation within two years. The price of such a plant could range from about $100 million to $250 million, which he will probably finance through the paper's earnings without personal out-of-pocket expense.
In effect, his actual cash outlay seems to be between $16.5 million and $17.5 million, which will be used to pay creditors and settle other obligations.
In theory, two obstacles remain unresolved for Mr. Zuckerman. They are reaching agreement with the creditors and forging a guild contract. But neither the guild nor the creditors are believed capable of stopping the sale.
Mr. Zuckerman's strategy has hinged on the assumption that the best way to win ownership of the paper was to win over its unions, because the paper would be worthless without them. He has offered concessions to major unions, like allowing the drivers, the only union thought capable of stopping publication in a strike, to deliver all copies of The News, rather than using wholesalers for some deliveries.
During round-the-clock negotiations Wednesday, at the prodding of union leaders and advisers, Mr. Zuckerman and the Newspaper Guild managed to bridge critical differences and come close enough to agreement to make an eventual contract -- and hence union unanimity -- all but assured.
From the start, Mr. Zuckerman has said that he viewed rebuilding the news operation of The News to be a top priority to restoring it as a viable business, and he has sought broad power to hire and fire in the newsroom, which the guild has denounced as union busting.
While the final agreement remains uncertain, those on both sides of the negotiations said that the essential compromise seemed to be a willingness on Mr. Zuckerman's part to drop his demand that advertising employees be removed from union jurisdiction and to offer enhanced severance to employees who volunteer to resign and, if necessary, to dismiss others in a layoff by seniority. Mr. Zuckerman also dropped his wish to restrict severance on some essential newsroom employees, in order to prevent their leaving.
In exchange, according to a union leader who spoke on condition of anonymity, Mr. Zuckerman will probably win new powers over what union leaders term "the unborn," meaning new employees. Mr. Zuckerman has sought the right to dismiss new employees without arbitration and a probationary period of a year rather than 90 days.
Barry F. Lipton, president of the guild, said that many aspects of the agreement were still subject to negotiation, including the number of people who will lose their jobs, but he expressed optimism that a contract can be reached.
 
Offer to Creditors
 And even if the guild should once again deadlock with Mr. Zuckerman, the process has now gone so far that the other unions are thought likely to proceed anyway.
To the creditors, who have outstanding claims against The News of about $35 million, Mr. Zuckerman has offered from 14 to 17 cents on the dollar, compared to as much as 40 cents offered by the Whitman Group, a New York firm that specializes in bankruptcies.
The creditors demonstrated that they still hope to wring a better offer from Mr. Zuckerman by making as much trouble for him as possible.
On Wednesday, the Whitman Group mounted a strong effort to block Mr. Zuckerman by making a clearly superior offer to the creditors and volunteering to provide a $3 million loan to the paper provided the creditors and the paper's board endorsed them as buyers of The News.
But the Whitman offer was bitterly denounced by Douglas LaChance, president of the drivers union, as a last-minute effort by an unknown buyer to derail the agreements that Mr. Zuckerman and his representative, Fred Drasner, had spent months negotiating.
When the paper's board endorsed Mr. Zuckerman's proposal about midnight, the Whitman offer effectively became moot.
At the urging of the creditors, Judge Tina L. Brozman of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan postponed until next Wednesday her ruling on Mr. Zuckerman's proposal to provide up to $3 million loans to The News, whose continuing losses have created a critical cash shortage. She also delayed until Wednesday a motion to guarantee Mr. Zuckerman $2.7 million in compensation for his expenses should another buyer ultimately acquire The News.
Because of Mr. Zuckerman's loan offer, the paper's management withdrew its request for an across-the-board 10 percent wage cut, saying the paper had sufficient funds to last until Wednesday.
Under his proposal, Mr. Zuckerman would be committed to providing an immediate loan of up to $500,000, up to $1 million when all nine unions ratify contracts with him, and up to $3 million when the court formally approves the acquisition, which could take place within 30 days.
Mr. Zuckerman said that a delay in court approval until Wednesday would have no effect on the situation.
Because of bankruptcy procedural requirements of bringing a company out of bankruptcy, Mr. Zuckerman probably could not actually close the sale until late November. And in such a bankruptcy sale, another buyer could come before the court with a higher and better offer, though the prospect that such an offer would block Mr. Zuckerman is considered remote.
The next step would presumably come in 30 days when the bankruptcy court would consider formally approving Mr. Zuckerman's proposal. If approved, closing would follow in another 30 days.

HEADLINE: Democrats Scale Back Aims In Congress to Win at Polls

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Eager to return to their districts to soothe angry voters, Democratic lawmakers have decided to scale back their legislative agenda.
Party leaders are plotting a strategic retreat on seven appropriation bills to forestall a new flurry of vetoes by President Bush, which would probably have forced Congress to stay in Washington through most of October. They have also jettisoned plans to press health-care legislation and a bill guaranteeing abortion rights because Democratic members have been unable to agree on which version to support. 
 Pressures to end the session by Oct. 4 grew on Tuesday when Peter Hart, a Democratic poll taker, struck fear in a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus by predicting that incumbents faced mounting resentment on Election Day. He urged them to act quickly to re-establish personal rapport with their constituents as people with deep roots in their districts, not as members of an institution discredited by scandal and at loggerheads with the President over policy.
 
Push for Quick Action
 For weeks, campaign aides to Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas have been quietly urging Congressional leaders to finish their work quickly, contending that the Democratic Presidential candidate is in a better position to challenge President Bush than a Democratic Congress held in low regard.
Mr. Hart's warning, and the response of disquiet among the membership, further persuaded Congressional leaders to back away from their independent strategy of underscoring their differences with the President. Accordingly, Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate appropriation subcommittees are now consulting to decide what programs to cut from the seven bills so they can keep the spending levels of each appropriation bill consistent with Mr. Bush's requests.
Democratic Senators do not face the same re-election pressures as their colleagues in the House, but they have deferred to them and agreed to make the necessary cuts, amounting to more than $10 billion. Democrats had contended that the threat by Mr. Bush to veto individual appropriation bills that exceeded his requests was hollow, since the total financing of the 13 appropriation measures already approved by the House was $13 billion, or nearly 3 percent below White House requests.
"There is only one person who can confront the President and that is Bill Clinton," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn. "Most members are liked in their districts. It is only when they are away from their districts that these hobgoblins arise."
Democratic leaders have also pushed aside plans to sharpen their differences with the White House over health care and abortion rights because their members have been unable to resolve internal differences over policy and details.
They say they would now be content to pass two bills that Mr. Bush is likely to sign, one to encourage investment in depressed urban areas and the other to increase energy efficiency. They feel that such successes would allow them to argue that the 102d Congress had an adequate record of accomplishment, considering the long series of vetoes and unsuccessful override attempts.
"Members are real concerned," said Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Westchester Democrat who faces a bitter re-election race against former Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi. "This is no time to play political games. We might as well go home and work toward a new administration and a new session where we can make real progress on health care and the economy."
With primaries still left in Hawaii and Louisiana, a postwar record of 19 House incumbents have already lost in primaries this year. Many more incumbents are expected to lose on Election Day because their districts have been redrawn, or because of overdrafts at the House bank and an anti-incumbent mood that has turned seniority into a liability in many states.
Mr. Hart's presentation helped resolve a debate over two divergent tactical lines proposed by various Democratic lawmakers. Some had argued that the Democrats were poised to gain from Presidential vetoes of spending bills, which include money for veterans, health and the elderly, even if a deadlock over appropriation legislation temporarily shut down the Government. But the majority concluded that the President was in a better position to blame Congress for continued deadlocks.
 
Division Among Democrats
 The Democratic decision to de-emphasize confrontation with the White House was also based on the realization that the Democrats themselves are divided on important social issues like health care.
Congressional Democrats had long sought to exploit widespread unhappiness with the current health insurance system as an issue to embarrass Mr. Bush. They had hoped to pass a national insurance plan before the Presidential election. But they have been unable to agree on a plan.
Similarly, Democratic leaders said they wanted to underscore their differences with the Administration over abortion rights by passing the Freedom of Choice Act, which would codify the Supreme Court ruling of Row v. Wade, which legalized abortion in 1973. But when they found that they could not pass the bill without the including amendments that would place new restrictions on abortion rights, they dropped their plans.

HEADLINE: Finally, Stamford Arts Center to Open

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Sept. 17

 BODY:
After more than a decade of grand plans and false starts, cost overruns and acrimonious disputes, the Stamford Center for the Arts next week will open the performing-arts complex that its creators have called, with a good bit of hyperbole, the Lincoln Center of Fairfield County.
The Rich Forum -- a $15.3 million concrete-and-glass structure named for the center's president and Stamford's master builder, Frank D. Rich Jr. -- makes its official debut with a $1,000-a-ticket gala next Friday, although its first season will be a thin patchwork of performances interspersed with corporate meetings. 
 The Forum's producer, Alexander Cohen, envisions it as a major regional theater, yet the main theater's odd size and the region's economic woes may make it difficult for the Forum to thrive. And some community arts organizations that have benefited little from the public and private spending on the center fear that it will be an elitist institution serving only the well-to-do.
"The Forum is an expression of confidence in Stamford's future," Mr. Rich said. The developer was the key player in transforming Stamford during the 1970's and 1980's into a hub of sleek corporate headquarters, although parts of his own real-estate empire are now threatened by foreclosure proceedings.
 
Debate Over Priorities
 But Mary Hawe, a Stamford Republican leader and advocate for the poor, said: "Over the long years of construction delays, the center did nothing to foster arts in the community. Instead, public resources were sucked up by the center and not going where they were needed."
The Forum's plush Truglia Theater, named for the late State Senator Anthony Truglia, will begin its first, truncated season on Dec. 22, when the Broadway production of Brian Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa" opens for a two-week run. Three other works also will be presented for two weeks each -- "Falsettos," "Lost in Yonkers" and a new Marsha Norman work called "Loving Daniel Boone." The Forum's second, smaller theater will present the Broadway spoof "Forbidden Broadway."
"This schedule is just designed to get the theater open," said Mr. Cohen, a veteran Broadway and television producer. "I don't intend to book this as a road house."
"Next year I plan to produce six to eight new plays with a company of our own and establish Rich Forum as one of the best regional theaters in America, like the Steppenwolf, Arena or Mark Taper," he said, referring to prominent regional theaters in Chicago, Washington and Los Angeles. He predicted that affluent residents of Fairfield and Westchester Counties would enthusiastically support Stamford productions that feature some of the more prominent actors from the area, like Glenn Close, Jason Robards and Richard Kiley.
 
Doubts in the Arts Community
 Despite Mr. Cohen's optimism, the Forum has had more than its share of doubters and critics.
"If it had been finished as scheduled, in the mid-1980's, when the economy was booming, its fortunes might be better," said Ralph A. Antonacci, who heads the Stamford Community Arts Council, a producing and advocacy group, and a longtime critic of the center's management.
He also said that the Forum had backed away from its initial plan, as proposed by Mr. Rich in 1979, for a "center for the arts that's affordable for all."
George Moredock, the managing director of Stamford's Palace Theater, which the center also operates, said the idea that the Forum would be built for community use "was a misconception from Day 1." He added: "The building was supposed to be built for 1,000 reasons over the last 13 years. But the key reason was economics, to promote Stamford, not as a home for community groups."
Even the Forum's design and setting present a welter of contradictions. The building is in an area now all but deserted by night, near Stamford's poorest, toughest neighborhoods. Inside, beyond the shimmering, 28-foot-high lobby windows, is a plaster-cast reproduction of the old Stamford Theater, which was razed to make way for the Forum.
 
Small Audience, Big Stage
 The Forum's main performance venue, the Truglia, has just 723 seats but a huge 48-foot-deep stage. The 150-seat Leonhardt Studio is meant for smaller performances and use as a studio for Connecticut Public Broadcasting.
"We would have loved the Rich Forum to be a grand concert hall," said Barbara Soroca, executive director of the Stamford Symphony. "But financially it doesn't make sense to put a 90-piece orchestra onstage and have only 700 people in the audience." The symphony performs at the Palace but will present several chamber-music and pops concerts at the Forum.
While the Truglia is too small to attract orchestras or large theater companies, producers say it is too large for a viable regional theater or smaller Stamford ensembles like the Young Artists Philharmonic. Mr. Cohen acknowledged that even with a large subscriber base and major grants, the center's 1993-94 budget may be several million dollars in the red.
Furthermore, Mr. Rich has said that if the Forum does not succeed as an arts center, its board of directors should consider using it for other purposes, like a conference center -- a suggestion that is chilling to local artists.
The center's history began in the late 1970's, when Mr. Rich and two Stamford-based companies, Pitney Bowes and Champion International, bought the Stamford Theater, intending to transform it into a year-round center for music, plays, opera and visual arts. Construction was to begin in 1985, at a cost of $6 million, with much of the financing coming from a city agency created to disburse state hotel-tax revenues for tourism.
 
An Expanded Role
 Between 1985 and 1989, the center's management shifted direction, buying the 1,500-seat Palace and demolishing the Stamford Theater. While they focused on the Palace -- booking popular performers like Johnny Cash and Itzhak Perlman -- they scaled back plans for a new complex, and decided to gear it toward touring national productions rather than local performing companies.
Construction began in 1989, but its scheduled spring 1991 opening was delayed as the center's mission again was broadened to include space for video productions and corporate gatherings.
What has particularly rankled many local performance companies is not only what they view as the center's apparent shift from its initial commitment to community artists but also the fact that it received $9 million in public money for operations of the Palace before the Forum even opened, plus $5 million toward its construction.
 
Testing Openness
 William Macklin, a co-founder of Stamford's Black Artists Theater Company, said: "The original concept was supposed to be that community groups like ours would have access to it. To get state funding, they had to say that community groups would benefit; otherwise, it would be discriminatory." He said he planned to test how open the center is by proposing a performance featuring rap artists.
While Mr. Rich pledged that the Forum would "welcome all" groups, and Mr. Cohen and Mr. Moredock have patched up relations with Stamford performance troupes, some remain wary.
As Mr. Antonacci said: "We want to put the disputes behind us, but this is a point in Stamford's arts development that bears very careful attention."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Given a Good Lead, Clinton Is No Longer Talking Tough

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The other night, the Democratic Presidential nominee entertained a group of reporters on his campaign plane with a run-down of Bill Clinton's Laws of Politics.
Mr. Clinton's laws speak of a deep and somewhat cynical understanding of the line of work he is in: "When you're starting to have a good time, you're supposed to be someplace else," and "Nearly everyone will lie to you, given the right circumstances." There was one well-known political law, along the same lines, that the candidate did not mention: Give the people what they want. 
 But if Mr. Clinton does not preach that particular law, increasingly he seems to be practicing it. The candidate who once sounded like a Dutch uncle, with his stern talk of cutting Federal spending and the need for sacrifice, now sounds more like a sugar daddy.
Speaking on Wednesday to an audience composed mostly of poor black residents of South-Central Los Angeles, Mr. Clinton promised "to put education and skills and money in your hands," "a job for everybody who wants to work" and for every American adult "the education and training they need to compete in a global economy."
Speaking here today to an audience composed mostly of middle-class and upper-middle class white people, Mr. Clinton promised to spend "every dollar by which we reduce defense in building an economy for the 21st century here at home, in environmental cleanup, in new technology."
He promised a "a new energy policy that will improve the environment, increase employment and make Americans more secure," and, more to the political point, would make a federally subsidized natural energy research center in nearby Golden, Colo., "flourish like a flower in the desert."
Back in the days before he was sitting on a 15-percentage-point lead over President Bush, Mr. Clinton used to make a point of talking tough. He warned about the dangers of the massive Federal deficit. He made a special point of taking his hardest messages directly to those who would least enjoy hearing them, lecturing a white audience in Georgia about racism and telling off the Rainbow Coalition for honoring the rap performer Sister Souljah.
Now, even when Mr. Clinton brings up such unpleasant subjects as cutting Federal spending, he does so in a way that makes something most experts on the Federal budget say would have to involve deep and painful cuts seem almost pain free.
"My idea for the deficit is to cut inefficient spending, reduce by attrition Federal employment by a 100,000 and give it to the cities to put 100,000 police officers on the streets in the next five years," he said today.
Similarly, in speaking to a group of 500 or 600 people at the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center in South-Central Los Angeles, Mr. Clinton never went anywhere near the themes of self-discipline and personal responsibility that have in the past characterized some of his speeches before black audiences.
The riots that began in South-Central Los Angeles last April were mentioned only in passing, described as "disturbances."
Mr. Clinton suggested his support for the point of view that blames the riots largely on economic conditions in South-Central Los Angeles.
"Don't you know we could diminish the racial tensions in this community, don't you know we could diminish the tensions between rich and poor in this community, if everybody thought that if they worked hard and played by the rules they could get ahead," he said.

HEADLINE: In Hawaii, Salvaging What the Hurricane Didn't Take

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WAIMEA, Hawaii, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Creeping gingerly through their devastated bedroom today, the Shea children, survivors of Hurricane Iniki, came upon a familiar sight in an unfamiliar setting: their mother's hand-lettered house rules, buried among the debris of their collapsed ceiling.
They read them aloud as if discovering evidence of a long-lost era: 
 "Every morning fold blankets without being told and wash your own dishes.
"Rice cook 5:00. Little ones come home 5:00. Big ones come home 6:00.
"If don't do chores, don't ask to sleep over at a friend's house on Saturday."
Since the storm ripped the roof and two walls from their ramshackle green wooden house last Friday, scattering their belongings for miles across the countryside, the Shea family has slept on the floor of a high school classroom where, rather than house rules, a bulletin-board notice proclaims: "Our changing world."
 
Emotional and Physical Toll
 Like many of the 8,000 people made homeless by the storm, their new routine at a Red Cross shelter includes food handouts and daily visits to their ruined home, which are trying as much for the emotional toll they take as for the hard work of salvaging their possessions.
"The first time I saw my house I just got sick," said the father, Maynard Shea, a 36-year-old security guard. "This is an exhausting thing. The mind really breaks down. I fell down on this mattress here and just slept."
Mr. Shea said he had lived in the house since he had been 5 years old. Last Friday the eye of Hurricane Iniki roared across Kauai's southern coast and over his house, 25 miles southwest of the capital, Lihue. "Our address used to be 4781 but the numbers blew away," he said.
Since the storm, Mr. Shea, his wife, Marla, and their seven children have created a large pile of refuse in front of their home and locked their few salvaged belongings inside a parked van for safekeeping.
"I kind of wish the storm had cleared everything away, had taken it all into the river," Mr. Shea said. "But it did just half the job and left the other half to me."
Cleaning up will be just the first difficult stage for the thousands of victims of the hurricane, which caused an estimated $1 billion in damage to this tropical island of 55,000 people.
With its winds of 160 miles an hour sweeping across the landscape -- like a supernatural hand, in Mr. Shea's image -- it devastated the farmland and the tourist hotels that are the basis of the island's economy.
 
Facing an Uncertain Future
 Mr. Shea comes from a family of hotel workers and tour drivers, and his wife is from a family of sugar plantation workers. The future for all of them is now uncertain.
Asked how long it would take to put the island's economy back on its feet, Kauai's Mayor, JoAnn Yukimura, pressed her fingers against her temples in weariness and said: "I don't think we know that right now. It's going to take a long while to recover from this."
She said the island, always hospitable to strangers, must now rely on the largess of government agencies.
 
House With No Insurance
 Mr. Shea said his only hope to avoid homelessness would be government loans or grants. "Nobody wanted to insure this house; it's too old," he said.
His father-in-law, Francis Furtado, said the devastation put in jeopardy his job as a crane operator at a sugar mill.
"Sugar has been slowly going down and they've been trying to fill in by planting coffee and macadamianuts," said Mr. Furtado, 57.
"But now everything's been affected. Papayas are wiped out," he said. "Bananas are wiped out. We lost pineapples already. With sugar down, it's, pow! And if the tourists stop coming, we're done for. We'll have to move to the mainland."
Mr. Shea's work as a security guard is at the Barking Sands missile testing range a few miles from here, and it is a source of family debate.
Mrs. Shea is one of a growing number of islanders who oppose the range, which tests "Star Wars" technology, because of fears that it could pose dangers to residents.
But the work pays well, and Mr. Shea noted that this is hardly a time to give up one's livelihood on principle. "If they close it down I'd be out of a job," he said. "I try to get her to remember that: who's feeding us for now."
As the shock of the disaster has begun to sink in across the island and people have found themselves living without electricity, running water or fresh food, a new edge of irritability is setting in.
 
Even Cars 'Don't Feel Right'
 Even mechanical objects seem to be balky, like the Sheas' Volkswagen, in which the driver's-side lock has jammed for no good reason. "A lot of people's cars are in shock," Mrs. Shea said. "They don't feel right."
Some looting has begun to be reported, a crime that Mrs. Shea attributed more to anger and restlessness than to need. One young man from Waimea was seen today wandering the streets of the island's capital with a machete inexplicably under his arm.
"There's a lot of tension now," Mrs. Shea said. "I see it in everybody. The children are starting to get a little irritated. I wish school were on."
As she spoke, military relief helicopters flew noisily back and forth above her ruined home -- one more annoyance.
"I wish I could leave everything in there," she said with a glance at her house, which looked somehow rakish without its roof or back wall. "I wish I could just tell the guys with the tractors to knock the whole thing down."
Her husband and their daughters, Kimberly, 13, and Jocelyn, 11, were inspecting the remains of her bedroom, exposed to all the world now without walls or ceiling.
On a shelf, Jocelyn's plastic cheerleading trophy was still in its place, but Kimberly's was gone. The championship trophy for Mr. Shea's Kaimanas basketball team was still there; his hustle award trophy and his cherished Mayor's trophy were gone.
 
'Bills Didn't Fly Away'
 "You'd be surprised what stayed," Mr. Shea said. "My church clothes: my white shirt and good pants. But my work clothes went.
"My bills didn't fly away. What I wanted to fly away, it stayed."
In happy surprise he pulled a basketball from a closet and tossed it into the air, exclaiming, "Look what's still here!"
After each discovery during the inspection of their house, Mr. Shea and his daughters carefully replaced the item as if there were still some order to be preserved here.
Mrs. Shea's hand-written house rules were tucked back among the sodden insulating material and strip of patterned curtain that littered the floor.
"Homework every day: do it all," the list of rules read.
And finally, just so nobody would forget who was in charge: "Do not let your friends convince you to break these rules!"
Mrs. Shea said her children sometimes tell her they feel like bums as they roll up their sleeping mats and stand in line for Red Cross handouts.
"I tell them we all feel like bums," she said. "You don't know what it feels like to be a street person until you lose your home. I tell them we are not in this situation alone. There are other people that are also suffering."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ethnic Voters;
Cold War's End Opens Battle on Domestic Issues

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The end of the cold war has provoked a new competition for the allegiance of urban ethnic voters who have supported Republicans in the last three Presidential elections.
For the last decade these conservative, fervently anti-Communist, blue-collar populations of Polish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Armenian, Serbian and Croatian extraction, many of whom live in the crucial swing states of the Midwest, have been among the staunchest "Reagan Democrats." With the passing of the cold war, both the Bush and Clinton camps agree that these constituencies are up for grabs. 
 When the Soviet empire collapsed, the Republicans lost the unifying force that bound these diverse descendants of refugees from "captive nations" and kept them on the Republican side. Instead, the Bush forces are emphasizing their conservative social agenda and their stewardship over the disintegration of Communism.
For the Democrats, the same factors represent a chance to use their traditional economic appeal to reclaim middle-class voters who abandoned them.
 
No More One-Stop Shopping
 The problem for both parties is that this Eastern and Central European ethnic bloc has shattered, often into hostile factions, which makes appealing to them increasingly complicated.
"Instead of one-stop shopping at the captive nations supermarket, you have to visit all of these ethnic boutiques," said Kevin Phillips, the Republican consultant.
For instance, Croatian-Americans and Serbian-Americans, who stood shoulder to shoulder at Reagan rallies in Eastern European neighborhoods in Milwaukee, Cleveland or Pittsburgh, are now fighting one another across the very same sidewalks. No one knows that better than Representative Jim Moody, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for his party's Senate nomination in Wisconsin this month.
Mr. Moody was a relief volunteer in Yugoslavia in the 1950's, and he learned Serbo-Croatian and made many friends there. Last December on a return visit, he met, among many others, a Serbian guerrilla leader in a Serbian-held area of Croatia. That led to pictures in the hometown press with the caption: "Moody inspects Serbian Troops in Croatia."
 
Wisconsin's Family Feud
 This infuriated the 8,000 Croatian-Americans in Wisconsin, who began picketing his rallies, disrupting his public debates and flooding his radio call-in shows. This then drew out the 10,000 Serbs in his defense, and the police had to begin separating them at all his public appearances.
"We got caught in the middle of a family fight, and there is nothing worse," said Marcus Kunian, Mr. Moody's chief of staff. "At one of our rallies in front of a hotel in Milwaukee the two sides were separated by a police barricade, and at one point one of the Serbians, a young guy, shouted across the street at one of the Croats: 'And Milo, I am sorry I ever dated your sister.' "
Suddenly ethnic voting maps, which once might have grouped all sorts of Eastern and Central Europeans, are being divided and subdivided.
Another major structural change that candidates have to deal with is the fact that during the cold war, ethnic groups like Poles, Ukrainians and Armenians played the role of shadow governments for their captive homelands behind the Iron Curtain. Their main focus was raising money for opposition parties and underground newspapers and lobbying Congress and the executive branch to open emigration to their compatriots.
 
America First Is No Comfort
 "Now the Poles have their own legitimate Government and embassy to do that, and so do the Ukrainians, Armenians, and Serbians," said Adrian Karatnycky, assistant to the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who deals with international affairs. "So now you see the Polish-American Congress reassuming the role of being the voice for community concerns, the elderly, pensioners, community centers. It makes them much more interested in the domestic side of the agenda."
All of this has been good news for the Clinton campaign, said Stephanie Solien, Mr. Clinton's national political director. Instead of the unifying threat being Communism abroad, which played into Republican hands, she said, "the unifying threat is now the state of the economy at home," which plays into Clinton's hands.
With these Eastern European communities clustered in the battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan and Illinois, Mr. Clinton is aggressively courting them not only with his economic arguments, but also with his standard lines about healing the divisions in the country.
Bush campaign officials say they are trying to hold these Eastern European communities with several new appeals. One is to argue that only an internationalist like Mr. Bush will remain interested in the affairs of the "old countries." Another, as Mr. Bush demonstrated to Polish-Americans in Hamtramck, Mich., is to take as much credit as possible for the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, or as Mr. Bush put it: "I called for an end to the cold war, and thank God the cold war has ended." Still another, which Mr. Bush tried out in a speech on the economy in Detroit on Sept. 10, is to offer free-trade agreements with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
There were, of course, issues other than foreign policy that converted these voters into Reagan Democrats, including economic expansion, tax cuts, quotas, the death penalty and, to some extent, abortion.
But the problem now, said the Republican consultant Roger Stone, is that just when the single unifying theme of anti-Communism has been removed, another element -- economics -- has become all consuming. While the Republicans tried at their convention to use a basket of extraneous cultural issues, like gay marriages and single mothers, to hold these constituencies, without anti-Communism, it has been hard to get them to overlook the economy.
"In the past it was enough for the Republican candidate to make the strongest possible anti-Communist appeal and then win the votes of three-quarters of Ukrainians," said Taras Bazyluk, a Ukrainian lawyer in Washington. "That is simply no longer the case. It just doesn't cut it anymore. This time, people are going to vote their pocketbooks."

HEADLINE: Reaching for The News;
Mortimer B. Zuckerman: Power, Wealth, Controversy

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
On Aug. 16, just about the time that Mortimer B. Zuckerman became the front-runner in the derby to purchase The Daily News, he gave a wedding at his estate in East Hampton, L.I., for the son of a longtime friend who died in February. By the accounts of several guests it was a terrific time, a warm and sunny event, even though it rained. Mr. Zuckerman toasted the young couple "almost as a father would," one guest said.
Warm and fuzzy is not the image most people have of the 55-year-old Mr. Zuckerman, now on the threshold of an opportunity to reverse the sliding fortunes of the 73-year-old tabloid. Indeed, it is fair to say that over the last two decades and up and down the Northeast Corridor, Mort Zuckerman has made more than a few people mad while making himself rich. 
 A real-estate developer who became a multimillionaire in the 1970's and turned publishing mogul in the 1980's with his purchases of The Atlantic and U.S. News & World Report, Mr. Zuckerman's path has generated a consistent wake of contention.
He has also proven himself a man drawn to the spotlight personally as well as professionally. As a lifelong bachelor with a history of high-profile female companions -- Gloria Steinem most notable among them -- his exploits have been fodder for gossip columns as well as business pages.
People who have known and worked with him paint a picture of a many-sided man possessed of a genuine warmth and capacity for friendship. But even his staunchest defenders concede that his reputation for flamboyance and self-promotion always precedes him. As more than one said, he is a man people love to hate.
 
Boston Properties
 Mr. Zuckerman owns 50 percent of Boston Properties, a development company that controls more than 80 properties in Boston, Washington and in the Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles areas, as well as the one-million-square-foot building at 599 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, which is its only New York building, but its largest. His net worth was estimated by Forbes magazine in 1990 as $375 million, though in the current soft real-estate market that figure has most likely declined. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Zuckerman would only say of his fortune, "It's enough to support the investment the Daily News will require."
In the interview, Mr. Zuckerman called himself "an urban alcoholic."
"I've always loved city life, and I've always been passionate about public policy and politics," he explained. "As soon as I started work, I turned to real estate as a way to be involved in urban life. And in journalism, the second world in which I live, there is no better opportunity to focus on city life -- and the city that I love -- than The Daily News."
He described his politics as "moderate, conservative" and said he had voted for President Bush in 1988, but he had been "extremely disappointed" with his performance as President. He made no comment about New York politics, but he added, "Obviously, we'll have an editorial position before the election, but it's too soon to consider that."
What signals this sends about his stewardship of The News are unclear. He has, in the past, been known as an owner who has tried to impose a heavy hand on editorial content, particularly in the first couple of years at U.S. News, where he has gone through four editors in eight years. Even those who ran afoul of him, however, give him credit for improving the magazine, both financially and editorially, and for becoming more prudent in his editorial actions.
 
'He's Smart'
 "Mort may be egotistical, but he's smart," said Roger Rosenblatt, who left the magazine in 1989 after what he called "substantive disagreements" with Mr. Zuckerman. "The lesson he may have learned is that a publication is not only a property -- it's a trust. I don't think he understood that at the beginning, but I think he understands it now."
Born in Montreal in 1937 -- he became a United States citizen in 1977 -- Mr. Zuckerman is a graduate of McGill University and Harvard Law School. At 24, he went to work at the old-line Boston development firm of Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, where he developed a reputation as both a boy wonder and a brash outsider.
In 1970, he left Cabot with a colleague, Edward Linde, to form Boston Properties, and almost immediately became embroiled in a bitter dispute with his former firm, suing them over ownership interest in a developed property -- and winning.
A decade later, after he purchased the Atlantic Monthly Company as his first foray into publishing, Mr. Zuckerman refused to pay five of the major stockholders their second installment of the purchase price, claiming they had misrepresented the company's finances; the legal battle stretched on for years.
 
Two Big Battles
 In between, Mr. Zuckerman found himself at the center of two of the decade's biggest political brouhahas in Boston. One, the building of the Marriott Long Wharf Hotel, resulted in the resignation of the executive director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority when Mayor Kevin White selected Boston Properties as the developer against the recommendations of the agency.
The other was a seven-year wrangle over the development of Park Square, a largely rundown tract in downtown Boston. The project, known as Park Plaza, never happened, having drawn the ire of environmentalists and residents of nearby neighborhoods who objected to the prospect of shadows falling on Boston Common, among other things.
A decade later, a similar fate would befall Mr. Zuckerman's proposed development of the Coliseum site at Columbus Circle in Manhattan, though the concern over shadows darkening Central Park was just one among many things that have thus far undermined the project. Boston Properties still has a contract with the city to purchase the site, but in the current economy it is not likely that a favorable deal will be made soon.
Through all the bickering and litigation, Mr. Zuckerman has garnered a fair amount of resentment, for both his celebrity status and his success. (Boston Properties has, in a down market, maintained an occupancy rate in its holdings of more than 90 percent.) Nonetheless, he has also seemed to retain a reputation for probity.
"In this business, many deals are basically handshakes," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. "People get known for either living up to or not living up to those agreements. He's somebody whose word can be counted on."
Mr. Zuckerman's word on The News: "I won't be trying to turn The Daily News into The New York Times. The Daily News is the newspaper for the people of New York. It's a popular newspaper. I'm looking to keep it that way."

HEADLINE: Cable TV Regulation Advances

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Armed with the powerful support of television broadcasters, the House of Representatives today approved by a wide margin a measure to regulate cable television prices.
The size of the vote, 280 to 128, means the House can probably muster the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto by President Bush, who immediately attacked today's measure as full of "costly, burdensome and unnecessary requirements." 
 But the legislation, which emerged from a House-Senate conference committee last week, still faces a big hurdle in the Senate, which is expected to act on the final version of the bill early next week.
 
Tougher Fight in the Senate
 Advocates conceded today that they would face a more difficult fight there. Some former supporters are said to be wavering, in part because of heavy lobbying from the White House, the cable industry and Hollywood producers.
The House vote increases the chances for the first override of a Bush veto. It also puts the President in what could be a no-win situation. Proponents of the legislation say it is the biggest consumer initiative in recent years and would both rein in prices for basic cable service and erode the monopoly franchises that cable companies enjoy in all but a handful of cities.
Nationwide, prices for basic cable service have climbed by about 50 percent, or three times the rate of inflation, since 1987, when rates were deregulated by Congress in an effort to promote the fledgling industry.
But critics of the bill, including some Democrats, argued that it would actually raise rates because it would entitle over-the-air broadcasters to demand a new stream of royalties from cable systems that retransmit their programs.
Whatever the eventual impact, most consumers are not likely to notice any difference in monthly bills soon. Most customers subscribe to a broader array of services, from Cable News Network to Nickelodeon, than the basic tier of local stations and public access channels. The second, broader tier of service is subject to much lighter regulation.
Indeed, the biggest effects and the biggest fights have been over provisions of the bill that would affect other industries: television broadcasters, satellite companies and manufacturers of television decoders.
 
Fight by Affected Industries
 The bill passed today would require the Federal Communications Commission to set regulations for reasonable prices for basic service, based on prices charged in the few communities where cable franchises face direct competition.
The bill also includes a controversial feature intended to encourage greater competition from satellite companies and "wireless cable" services that transmit television programming over microwave frequencies. Known as "program access," the provision requires big cable companies that own local franchises as well as produce popular programming to license their programs to rivals.
The big losers would be cable giants like Time Warner Inc. and Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, which owns interests in the Discovery Channel, Black Entertainment Television, Turner Broadcasting System and other programmers.
The most immediate winner may well be Hughes Network Systems, a unit of General Motors that is starting a satellite service that will beam multiple channels of television directly to small home antennas. The National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, an association of rural telephone companies, is investing $250 million in the venture and plans to market the service to rural households.
"I know this is election time, and we are all hungry for votes, but this is not the way," declared Representative Norman Lent, Republican of Long Island, in the course of the debate. "Consumers are smart enough to recognize that this bill is going to raise, not lower, rates."
The intense industry and Hollywood lobbying did erode support in the House. Twenty-eight Democrats and 19 Republicans who supported the House bill on July 23 did not today. The Senate version passed in January by 73 to 18.
But the biggest threat to the bill may be the calendar. Congress is planning to adjourn in early October, and the President is allowed to consider a bill for 10 days before signing or vetoing it. Senate opponents of the bill are expected to try a filibuster.

HEADLINE: Lifting the Veil on Executive Pay

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
The head of the Gerber Products Company has overhauled the baby-food maker's executive-pay system so that the bosses will get big increases in compensation only if the company prospers. In addition, stockholders will get a much clearer picture of what management salaries will be.
Shareholders got their first glimpse of the new philosophy in the proxy statement that Gerber's chairman, Alfred A. Piergallini, distributed before last month's annual meeting. The document detailed precisely how much he and his team earned last year -- down to the last penny of the estimated value of their stock options; it is already being viewed by shareholder groups and others as a model of corporate candor. 
 "We are attempting to make it as clear as possible to shareholders what they're paying the people who are managing their business, why they're paying that amount of money, and what they're getting for it," said Mr. Piergallini, who made $2 million last year.
 
Argue for Confidentiality
 Most corporate managers vigorously oppose any formal limit on executive pay, arguing that they should be free to pay whatever is necessary to attract the best people. They regard some compensation information as confidential and not to be shared with competitors.
But they are under increasing pressure from stockholders and face mounting criticism from others, including managers in Japan and Germany, who maintain that executive compensation in America is often excessive and a big factor in reducing competitiveness.
Some other executives in the United States, in addition to those at Gerber, have also taken measures toward being more informative about salaries. Robert H. Campbell, for one, who took over the top job at the SunCompany a year ago, rewrote Sun's 1992 proxy because of the frustration he felt trying to decipher the first draft he was shown.
 
 
Other Examples
 "Proxies spend about 80 percent of the pages talking about how we pay executives and then, when you get done reading them, you still don't have much of an idea how executives get paid," he said. I.B.M. and the Gannett Company are among other companies that are providing more information than they once did.
Some smaller companies have started to limit the boss's salary to a certain percentage of what the rank-and-file make. Jack Stack, the chief executive of the Springfield Remanufacturing Corporation in Springfield, Mo., caps his annual salary and bonus at six times the $25,000 that the average factory worker takes home.
"I do it from the standpoint of being a leader and setting an example," Mr. Stack said. "I would personally be embarrassed to take some of the salaries other c.e.o.'s take, especially when they are not purchasing the fixed assets they need to be competitive or creating jobs."
But by comparison with Gerber, the efforts of the other big corporations in control and disclosure of management pay are regarded as -- well -- baby steps.
And pay packages over all continue to show signs of bloat. Chief executives at the nation's largest public companies averaged $2.56 million last year, up 5.3 percent from 1990, according to new statistics compiled by Graef S. Crystal, a business professor at the University of California at Berkeley. That sum was roughly four times what the typical Japanese chief executive made and 139 times the average American paycheck. Gerber's stockholders are thrilled. As the owner of 781,100 shares, the California Public Employees' Retirement System sent an uncharacteristically laudatory letter to Gerber's directors last week congratulating them on their chief executive's "pioneering stance."
Likewise, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who wants companies to voluntarily put a dollar value on stock options given corporate employees or risk facing laws that will force them to do so, could not be more tickled.
"The Gerber proxy is miles ahead of the average company proxy in giving its stockholders clear and straightforward information about what its executives are paid and why," he said.
The rare set of revelations in the proxy statement by Gerber, based in Fremont, Mich., also drew appreciative comments from some of the nation's biggest critics of executive pay. Professor Crystal devoted an entire issue of his usually scathing newsletter to praising Mr. Piergallini and arguing that he be given an immediate $700,000-a-year raise in light of his superior performance and gumption.
If Gerber's overhaul of its executive-compensation system is uncharacteristic of American companies, so is Mr. Piergallini uncharacteristic of chief executives. Only 46 years old, he took over in 1990 and almost from the start aimed for drastic changes in the corporate culture. Many mailings to shareholders are now printed on recycled paper, and the company's 12,000 employees are referred to as associates. "The term implies partnership rather than servitude," he said.
Since Mr. Piergallini's arrival, shareholders have earned a 52.5 percent return on their investment, versus the 30.8 percent they would have made with the Standard & Poor's 500.
Part of the reason he changed the compensation system, he said, was to make more employees think like owners. He expanded incentive plans so that 400 people, up from 90, now receive stock options, and 300, up from 100, receive annual bonuses. At his insistence, long-term incentive awards are now paid in stock rather than cash.
The new system includes even more carrots. Senior executives who acquire stock by exercising options and hold those shares for three years get a fifth of a share of restricted stock as a bonus. In addition, senior executives can take 20 to 100 percent of their annual bonuses in stock and get 20 percent more if they maintain their holdings in the company for five years.
The result is that pay packages are far more sensitive to Gerber's performance in the stock market than ever.
Mr. Piergallini's own 1991 pay is a case in point: it shot up 39 percent, but 63 percent of his total compensation came from some form of stock, versus 37 percent the year before. And because his total Gerber stake is worth some 7.1 times his annual salary and bonus, future downdrafts in the stock could wipe out much of the gain to his net worth.
 
A Clear-Cut Statement
 That said, Mr. Piergallini would still not be regarded as much of a maverick were it not for the proxy statement he mailed to shareholders before last month's annual meeting.
While most other companies force investors to hunt for the information, Gerber's shareholders can, with minimal effort, glean from the proxy statement that Mr. Piergallini made $2.02 million in 1991, compared with the $1.45 million he earned the year before. The document provides, too, an estimated value for his 8,333 stock options, that is, rights he was given to buy the company stock at a set price at any time over a period of 10 years. To compute the figure, $203,000, Gerber relied on a mathematical model widely used for nearly two decades by traders, economists -- and personnel departments.
That information is almost never shared with investors. Among other things, the other companies contend that a stock option's present value cannot be calculated with absolute certainty.
"There's no question that a corporation which chooses to provide that information in its proxy materials has every right to do so, and it may well be good corporate policy," said Brian Borders, the president of the Association of Publicly Traded Companies. But he added, "Mandating that kind of disclosure, especially under a disputed formula, is something that this association would oppose."
 
An Eclectic Board
 A veteran of several consumer products companies before Gerber, Mr. Piergallini graduated from the University of Chicago's business school in 1970, three years before the first powerful model for evaluating options was developed. Nonetheless, he seems at ease with the model, and brushes aside the corporate arguments against the practice. "We would be lying to you if we said that it couldn't be done," he said.
One reason why Gerber might have been able to bolt from the pack was the varied and unconventional makeup of its board. A poet sits on the board, along with a pediatrician and a top officer of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Because Mr. Piergallini is the only chief executive on the board, no directors were likely to reject his ideas for fear of setting a precedent at their own companies. All this is not to suggest that Gerber has achieved a perfect peace with its shareholders. The company had to allot space in its proxy and time at its annual meeting so a group of five former executives and one local businessman could state their grievances against management, and its proxy mentions a few corporate practices that a die-hard reformer could still harp about.
The most serious: the company hands out replacement options to executives who exercise their options early, a controversial practice because it allows the executives to benefit from temporary jumps in the stock price. This runs counter to the attempts to get more people at Gerber to think about the long-term future instead of short-term gain for themselves.
 
Criticism of Chairman
 "I was concerned about some of the things current management was doing that I thought demonstrate short-term thinking," said Ray Frodey, a former vice president of the company who is one of the dissidents. He cited the $280,959 cash bonus Mr. Piergallini received last year based solely on 1991's results as one example. He also believes that Mr. Piergallini's total pay should be trimmed in half.
Others dismiss the criticisms as nitpicking. "When you look at the Gerber situation, it's difficult to find much that a shareholder would get too exercised about," said Stephen O'Byrne, a leading compensation consultant at Stern, Stewart & Company.
For his part, Mr. Piergallini understands that multimillion-dollar pay packages will always be controversial, no matter how well deserved. "If someone who owns a share of stock is making $45,000 a year, and the chief executive made $700,000 in salary, it's human nature to say maybe this guy is making too much money," he said. "I might say the same thing."

Woes at Telmex Not of Its Making

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
ON paper at least, Telefonos de Mexico ought to trade among American investors the way well-regarded companies like Pacific Telesis or BellSouth do. Of publicly traded Latin American telephone companies, Telmex has managers who stand head and shoulders above the rest, analysts say. The United States is the most frequently telephoned country from Mexico, and Mexico is the second most frequently telephoned country, after Canada, from the United States.
And as Congress debates the North American Free Trade Agreement, chatter on telephone lines between Mexico and the United States is bound to rise to a din. This year, Mexico-to-United States phone conversation is expected to total some 1.5 billion minutes, or more than 2,850 years. 
 Yet since February, when it peaked at $60.12 per American depository share, Telmex has suffered successive blows, dropping more than 25 percent, to the mid-40's. (One depository share, an instrument representing ownership of foreign stocks, equals 20 Telmex shares.) The Mexican Government's tight-money policy, unfounded rumors of big employee stock sales, and even the stillborn Presidential candidacy of Ross Perot, who strongly opposed the free-trade agreement, all battered Telmex's price.
In recent days, Telmex stock has fallen to $42 and rebounded to more than $45, driven by no particular news event. The shares closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $43.625, down 12.5 cents.
The major problem: sheer size. At current exchange rates, Telmex's market capitalization is nearly $24 billion, almost one-fifth of the entire Mexican stock market.
"For all intents and purposes, Telmex and the Mexican stock market are identical," said William Kurtz, who follows Telmex for H. G. Wellington & Company, a Wall Street brokerage house. Stephanie Georges, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said, "Telmex tends to get swept up in Mexico frenzy -- uncertainty over gross domestic product growth, dollar weakness because its earnings are denominated in dollars, and political currents resulting from how U.S. politicians view Mexico."
Telmex's second major problem is the tight-money policy. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari wants to reduce Mexico's 1991 annual inflation rate of more than 18 percent to close to single digits in 1993 by the time the free-trade pact, if it is ratified, goes into effect. Meanwhile, higher short-term borrowing costs, 18 percent today, up from 11 percent last year, mean higher borrowing costs for Mexican equities, the king of which is Telmex.
That Telmex is not the captain of its own fate is a shame, analysts say. Alone among the major publicly traded Latin American telephone companies -- the others are Argentina, Brazil and Chile -- Telmex has committed a great deal of time, money and management savvy to improving a creaky telephone system, analysts say.
In an $8 billion project that comes to a close next year, Telmex, among other tasks, is installing modern telephone switching computers in some 2,000 central offices serving 10,000 cities and towns. Included in this expenditure is a $400 million specialized network for the country's 700 largest domestic and foreign companies, mainly United States companies.
This network uses digital signals for improved service and reliability. Known as Red Digital Integrada, or integrated digital network in Spanish, it will be expanded as early as next year to more than 1.5 million business customers. Telmex also plans to spend at least $8 billion more over the next three years to modernize, Hector Carlos, marketing vice president, said.
Because Mexican telecommunications is flat on its back -- only 55 percent of calls are completed, up from 47 percent in 1987 -- every peso spent on improved phone service yields a bigger return on investment than a similar investment in a developed country.
By the calculations of Ms. Georges of Salomon Brothers, the market has already given a high value to Telmex, about $4,800 in market capitalization and debt per telephone line, compared with $3,200 for Chile, $2,700 for Argentina and $575 for Brazil, where inflation is high and the Government is under a cloud from scandal.
Joanne C. Smith of Nomura Research Institute sees Telmex earning $4.80 per A.D.S. this year, up from $3.80 in 1991, and she expects $6 in 1993. At those levels, Telmex is going for about six times cash flow for a company growing at 20 percent annually. By comparison, American "Baby Bells" typically cost five times cash flow and grow only 3 percent to 4 percent annually.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Paints Clinton as 'Social Engineer'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JONESBORO, Ga., Sept. 17

 BODY:
President Bush delivered a slashing assault on Gov. Bill Clinton's economic policies today, painting his rival as a "social engineer" whose proposed tax and spending increases threaten the life styles and freedoms of Middle America.
Unleashing some of the most pointed language of his campaign, Mr. Bush cast the Democratic Presidential nominee as an Oxford-educated liberal bent on reviving big-government theories that have failed in capitals "from Warsaw to Prague to Moscow." 
 "He would unite the Presidency and the Congress to achieve one end above all others: more government," the President said at a rally here. "A government that taxes more, spends more, regulates more, encourages more lawsuits and shuts off more products from the markets that Americans create."
Adopting Mr. Clinton's policies, the President said, "would be like going out to the used car lot down the road and buying the lemon that you got rid of 12 years ago." That was an allusion to former President Jimmy Carter, who presided over the last economic downturn to rival the current one.
 
Enthusiasm in Oklahoma
 Mr. Bush spoke in Enid, Okla., an oil-patch town of about 50,000 people that has not fully recovered from the 1980's collapse of oil prices but which turned out enthusiastically for him today. About 2,000 people filled a civic auditorium to hear Mr. Bush's remarks, and thousands more lined a town square to watch his limousine roll by.
That was a far larger crowd than met him this afternoon in Jonesboro, an Atlanta suburb. Here, perhaps a thousand people visited a new subdivision to hear Mr. Bush talk about his efforts to help home ownership.
In Enid, Mr. Bush billed his address from the outset as "a serious talk, not a rally speech" about the economy. In fact, it was a bare-fisted effort to sow fear among voters unhappy with the President about the consequences of voting for the Democratic alternative.
That follows a strategy set by Mr. Bush's top aide, James A. Baker 3d, to focus the debate on the future of the economy rather than on its current condition.
The strategy also underscores what opinion polls have long indicated: that confidence in Mr. Bush's economic stewardship is so low that he must make Mr. Clinton seem even more unpalatable if he is to win a majority.
With its disparaging references to Oxford, the 1960's and Mr. Clinton's "economic elite," and its allusions to socialism, the 41-minute speech was redolent with the blue-collar appeals that helped Ronald Reagan lure Democrats to his fold in 1980 and 1984.
Mr. Bush made no attempt today to explain or minimize the economy's present problems. Instead, he argued that the real danger facing the nation is that voters will "grasp change blindly, without considering seriously where these changes will lead us or what they mean in our daily lives."
"At a decisive moment in history comes your choice about who should lead the American economy: the government planner or the entrepreneur, the risk-taker," the President said. "This is the most fundamental disagreement between us: whether the driving engine of growth is government interventionism or entrepreneurial capitalism."
 
Risk-Taker Turned Politician
 Mr. Bush, a full-time politician and Federal official since 1966, cast himself today as the risk-taker -- a Texas oil man who for 18 early years "built a business from the ground up, created jobs and paid my taxes."
By contrast, he said, the role model for Mr. Clinton, who has spent almost his entire adult life in government and politics, "is not the entrepreneur but the government planner, the lawyer or policy professor who flatters himself that he understands the American economy better than the workers and the entrepreneurs who have their sleeves up."
Later, he added: "My opponent is drawn to these views. He and a number of his advisers studied them at Oxford in the 1960's."
The Clinton campaign quickly counterattacked by questioning Mr. Bush's talk of his experience running a small business. "When George Bush left Yale to work in the oil industry, he got the benefit of some 'family values,' Kennebunkport style," the campaign said in a press statement.
Quoting from published reports, it said Mr. Bush's uncle Herbert Walker had given Mr. Bush $300,000 to start his oil business in the early 1950's, an amount that the Democrats said would be the equivalent of $1.5 million in today's dollars. They said fewer than 5 percent of small businesses have a stake of more than $30,000 at the outset.
"George Bush is saying that everybody would be better off if they had an Uncle Herbie," the Clinton camp said. "What small businesses need to survive is Uncle Sam on their side, not in their way."
Mr. Bush holds an economics degree from Yale University. But he warned today that a Clinton administration would be ruled by a different "economic elite of the so-called 'best and brightest,' " who he said "can trace their intellectual roots to the social-engineering ideas popular at the turn of the century" that created the modern welfare state.
Mr. Clinton calls his economic policy "investment" in the nation's infrastructure, Mr. Bush said. "But no matter what you call it," he added, "it's still big-time government spending, directed by Washington planners who want to reorder social and economic priorities. And we can't have that."
That, he said, is the way of "command and control" economies that have been discarded "from Mexico to Eastern Europe, from Russia to South China."
On paper, at least, the two candidates do have opposing views of what the next four years should hold. Mr. Clinton's proposal for change includes $150 billion in new taxes on the well-off and on business, and $220 billion in new Federal spending to stimulate economic growth.
 
Freeing Money to Invest
 Mr. Bush has proposed to cut taxes, by perhaps $130 billion or more, and to reduce Federal spending by hundreds of billions more, mostly by restraining the rise in Federal spending on Medicaid, Medicare and other programs. The President says that would increase growth by freeing money for businesses to invest and hire new workers.
But the two candidates' records suggest the differences are not so stark. As the Governor of Arkansas, Mr. Clinton has espoused pro-business, fiscally moderate policies. And despite Mr. Bush's advocacy of lower taxes and smaller government, the share of national income consumed by Federal spending has risen to near-record levels during his tenure, from 22 cents to 24 cents of each dollar.
In Georgia, Mr. Bush again handed out Federal benefits to prospective voters, announcing a cut in insurance premiums on 15-year Federal Housing Administration mortgages. The White House said that would reduce the up-front cost of buying a home with such a mortgage by $650, and cut annual premium costs by $165 to $325 a year.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
In Their Own Words

 BODY:

PRESIDENT BUSH
In a speech yesterday at a campaign rally in Enid, Okla.
"Look at the differences. My opponent and his advisers propose something quite different. Their writings refer to European models and industrial policy. And that's an academic term for letting the government pick economic winners and losers. 
 Their idea is not the entrepreneur but the government planner, the lawyer or the policy professor who flatters himself that he understands the American economy better than the workers and the entrepreneurs who have their sleeves up and really make it work.
And my opponent and his advisers can trace their intellectual roots to the social engineering ideas popular at the turn of the century. And those old social -- some of you historians remember this -- those old social engineers advocated large-scale government ownership to give the state the leading role in society and economy. And today, European governments are still selling off the inefficient industrial monstrosities that were born from those ideas."
 
GOV. BILL CLINTON
In a speech yesterday at a campaign rally in Denver
"We have to cooperate -- government, business, labor and education -- we have to compete, so that we can win in the world economy. Let's do what works, for a change, and abandon what has plainly failed.
I want to have an investment program for this country which, yes, asks the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans to pay a little more in taxes, but uses that money to say, if you want to get it back, you can get it back, but no more across-the-board tax cuts. You can get it back if you'll invest in American factories and in starting small businesses and in putting the American people back to work, a real investment plan for the United States of America.
I want a new partnership between government and business and labor in this country, to develop the best ideas we have and turn them into jobs here in America. That is why, that is why, two days ago, in Northern California and San Jose, 21 -- 21 -- chief executives of high technology companies, two-thirds of them Republican, in an unprecedented break with party, endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket, because we have a technology policy for the 21st century."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN EUROPE;
Crisis There, But Not Here
Little Impact Is Seen On Presidential Race

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
During the 40 years of the cold war, foreign crises often helped American Presidents win re-election, beginning with Harry S. Truman, the designated role model of the 1992 campaign. The striking success of the Berlin airlift played a significant part in Mr. Truman's upset victory in 1948.
Sometimes a President's failure to satisfy the nation that he was moving effectively enough to defuse a crisis abroad contributed to his defeat. That was the case with Jimmy Carter and the hostages in Iran in 1980. 
 But the currency crisis in Europe is another matter. American policies and actions contributed relatively little to its development, and there is little that Washington can do to alleviate it, economists believe. So there is not much room, at least at the moment, for President Bush to strut his Presidential stuff, demonstrating in the process how invaluable experience is, or much room for Bill Clinton to view with alarm and call for more vigorous American leadership.
"Up until now, the United States has been relatively unaffected," said David C. Mulford, the Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, noting that the dollar had recovered recently. That, he argued, showed that its earlier decline constituted no adverse "pronouncement on the fundamentals of the U. S. economy."
If the turbulence in currency trading continued unabated, of course, it would sooner or later cause trouble in other financial markets, and that might further damage Mr. Bush, who is already regarded as an uncertain economic steward by large majorities of voters, according to opinion polls. But the situation seemed to be stabilizing yesterday as European governments maneuvered to restore order.
Few voters are likely to grasp, and fewer still to be swayed by, the nuances of the situation -- for example, the fact that the United States was ill placed to persuade the Europeans to lower their interest rates as a stimulus to growth, which might have averted the crisis, at a time when its own huge deficits have contributed to international difficulties.
Learned discussions about economic abstractions on the other side of the Atlantic are not the same thing at all as an electorate bombarded on television with questions about the fate of hostages. Americans, who even today buy many fewer imported goods than Europeans, are not nearly so politically sensitive to or knowledgeable about currency relationships.
Nonetheless, anything that keeps the spotlight on the economy or seems likely to prolong the recession cannot do the President any good. And C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research group, said that continued high interest rates and stagnating economies in Europe would inhibit American exports, make it "very, very hard" for the United States to emerge from recession anytime soon.
The sudden disintegration of the system linking European currencies -- and the possibility that it may lead to the collapse of the hard-won Maastricht agreement on greater European unity -- has other lessons to teach politicians in the United States as well as those at its center.
One is the age-old lesson about the limits on the power of even the strongest men and institutions, which apply with increasing force in modern political economics. If George Bush has failed to make the American economy do his bidding, he has plenty of company among Western political leaders.
The man at the center of the crisis is the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl. He is one of the premier advocates of European unity, largely because it offers the best way to defuse fears of German dominance among Germany's neighbors, born of three wars in a century. Yet he has been caught in a policy vise that has almost certainly slowed the movement toward unity.
German reunification is costing far more than Mr. Kohl or anyone else calculated, but he is committed to it. He has chosen to pay for it by running up a deficit, and to stop that from causing the kind of runaway inflation that destroyed the Weimar Republic in the 1930's, the German central bank has kept interest rates high. Mr. Kohl could have raised taxes to pay for rebuilding the East, but like other Western politicians in the last 10 or 15 years, he has come to see higher taxes as a tool with an unacceptable political cost.
He could also have cut spending for other purposes, but that might have hurt his re-election hopes.
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said that budget deficits in Germany and Italy must be reduced quickly to restore stability, and other officials of the fund argue that deficits in the United States are siphoning off capital and slowing economic recovery.
"In Germany as in the United States, there is a lot of economic pain to be allocated, and not much political will to allocate it," said Jeffrey Garten, the author of "A Cold Peace," a new book about Germany, Japan and the United States and their economic relations over the next decade. He said the world economy was "in a rudderless situation," with inadequate leadership at home and abroad.
The power of modern, polycentric markets, with trading roaring ahead 24 hours a day in London and New York and Frankfurt and Tokyo, has all but overwhelmed governments. Using traditional tactics, the British poured hundreds of millions into the markets to prop up the pound, and increased interest rates dramatically, but they were pop-guns against the onrushing tanks of the currency speculators.
Already, the momentum toward European unity has been weakened, and it will be stopped in its tracks if the Maastricht Treaty is rejected by the French in a referendum on Sunday. The Danes have already voted down the treaty, opinion in Britain has turned negative and the Germans, if not their Government, are having second thoughts about giving up the Deutsche mark.
 
'Nobody's Following Them'
 "Our leaders find themselves marching along the road to unity," said a senior European diplomat, "and nobody's following them. They forgot to bring public opinion along, rather like Lyndon Johnson in Vietnam. It's a fundamental problem in democratic societies, and a very serious one."
If European unity is stymied, European leaders and economies are likely for a time to turn in upon themselves, considerably complicating the job of the next President.
"Bush talked about the importance of increasing exports in his Detroit speech, and that means Europe, among other places," said Robert Hormats, an investment banker who has held ranking positions in several administrations. "But it's going to be much harder to deal with Europe on trade questions, and it's going to make the business environment much more difficult. Whether Clinton or Bush is elected, the job will be tougher."
It will also require an economic team of considerable talent and finesse, just as the cold war required national-security experts of a high order. Mr. Bush's economic aides, most notably Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, have been under fire for months from within his party as well as experts in other nations.

HEADLINE: Credit Markets;
Seeking Opportunities in Europe's Woes

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The rupture of the European Monetary System is causing chaos in Europe. But for Stephen C. Bartow, who manages foreign bond funds, it is creating opportunities.
"It doesn't make any difference to me as a portfolio manager," said Mr. Bartow, who is the chief investment officer for the global fixed-income group at the Putnam Companies in Boston. "There is an opportunity in every situation." 
 Mr. Bartow said the withdrawal of both Britain and Italy from the monetary system was setting the stage for cuts in interest rates in Europe. A rate reduction is positive for bond markets there, which have been suffering under the weight of the high rates that Germany set and members of the European Monetary System were required to follow.
"Our view would be that if you take a three-to-six-month view, European bonds offer the best value," he said.
The breach of the monetary system has also pleased David W. Rossmiller, vice president of international fixed-income operations at the Travelers Investment Management Company in Hartford.
"It makes me a happy guy," he said. "I have not really been hurt by the crisis. And in the long term it provides more opportunity because the relationship among all markets will be sloppier."
What Mr. Rossmiller means is that without the knitted currency and interest rate relationships of the European Monetary System, there will be less similarity in the performance of bond markets.
For example, he said the spread, or differential, between the yield of French bonds and German bonds would widen. In the last year, he said, this spread narrowed to 40 to 60 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, because investors expected the European Monetary System and the prospect of a single European currency to narrow the differential among inflation rates, budget deficits and interest rates. And this meant that European bond markets would move more in concert with one another.
But if the current crisis puts off the single currency, things will change. The spread yesterday between 10-year French and German bonds was more than 100 basis points, and Mr. Rossmiller said he expected the gap to widen. And with this variance in performance, he has more chances to jump from one market to another and build on his capital gains as interest rates move at different paces.
It had been the view of many bond portfolio managers and analysts at the beginning of this year that European bonds would be the best value because they expected Germany to cut interest rates in the spring or fall. But that did not happen. Instead, the Germans raised interest rates in July. A lot of American investors would have been badly hurt, had it not been for the decline of the dollar, which cushioned their losses.
The paradox is that a crisis that could doom the European Monetary System, which tied the currencies of 11 countries in fixed trading ranges before the exit of Italy and Britain, may finally make the promise of European bond markets a reality.
 
Foreign Bonds
 The activity in bonds was in foreign markets yesterday, especially in Britain.
"It was a pretty bizarre day," said David E. Smart, managing director of Fiduciary Trust International Ltd. in London. He said trading was heavy and it was hard to trust the prices on computer screens, because the market was moving so fast.
Five-year gilts were up sharply, rising about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 points. The 10-year gilt was up about 1/2 point. But the 20-year gilt was off 1 1/2 points.
Mr. Smart said the cut in the Bank of England's base lending rate back to 10 percent, after the British withdrew from the European Monetary System, helped to bolster the short end of the market.
He also said that a rejection on Sunday by the French of the Maastricht Treaty, which outlines the steps to a single European currency by the end of the century, would seriously damage the monetary system. But, he argued, the lack of a disciplined monetary system would also allow Britain to cut interest rates further to try to revive its economy. That prospect also lifted short maturities.
Mr. Smart said longer maturities were hurt because the British withdrawal from the monetary system was also sparking longer-term fears of inflation. The British Government could be much more lax in its economic policy if it paid attention only to domestic concerns, he said, and no longer had the discipline of a fixed trading range of exchange rates.
Bonds in Germany and France were off a little after rallying on Wednesday on the hope that the German central bank would cut interest rates yesterday. Those hopes were unfulfilled.
 
Treasury Market
 In the United States, investors seemed to be sitting on their hands, waiting to see how the situation played out in Europe. One of the interesting deals of the day was in the corporate market, where the Mexican Government issued its first dollar-denominated securities in the United States in 10 years.
The $250 million in 10-year noncallable notes were priced to yield 8.53 percent, 215 basis points over the yield of the comparable Treasury bill. Although the notes are not investment grade, Jon Winkelried, a partner at the lead underwriter, Goldman, Sachs & Company, said the spread of 10-year Treasuries was narrower than for other noninvestment-grade issues, which means that in a sense investors have upgraded Mexico before the rating agencies.
In secondary trading in the Treasury market, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was down just 2/32 to 993/32 to yield 7.32 percent, the same as on Wednesday. The prices of notes were also down slightly. The discount rate on three-month bills was unchanged; it was up one basis point for the six-month bill.
The new one year bill was auctioned at an average discount rate of 3.02 percent, the lowest since Jan. 9, 1963. Following are the results of the Treasury's auction yesterday of one-year bills:

HEADLINE: D'Amato Ad Puts Abrams On Defensive

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Still catching his breath after a brutal Democratic primary, State Attorney General Robert Abrams found himself on the defensive yesterday against his Republican opponent, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who unleashed a radio commercial branding him as "mudslide Bob Abrams" and accusing him of a "fund-raising shakedown."
That was a paradoxical description coming from Mr. D'Amato -- who takes some pride in his reputation as the Peck's Bad Boy of New York politics and has faced repeated inquiries into whether he has done favors for contributors. It was also a not-so-gentle hint of the tone of the seven-week campaign to come. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Abrams heard only an eerie silence from the woman whom he defeated for the Democratic nomination by a single percentage point. Geraldine A. Ferraro declined to concede, pending a final tally -- or to return a telephone call Mr. Abrams placed on Wednesday -- and prepared to leave town on a five-day retreat in an undisclosed location, her aides said.
"I think it's just tough for her to digest when it's that close," one Democratic Party official said. "But she'll be O.K.."

 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said yesterday that Ms. Ferraro had told him that she simply wanted to be sure of the final results and that she had questioned what Mr. Abrams would do in her place.
Mr. Abrams also spent the day out of sight, making thank-you calls to supporters and starting to raise money for his race against Mr. D'Amato, whose $3.7 million treasury is five times bigger than his.
About the only bit of good news for the Democratic nominee was one he had nothing to do with: the National Abortion Rights Action League announced that it would run what it called a major independent drive to identify Republican and independent women voters around the state who support abortion rights and urge them to vote against Mr. D'Amato. "We are going to invest as much as we can afford," said Kate Michelman, the league president. "I think this is doable. It's not easy. He's a well-entrenched incumbent, but this is a big issue this year. I think Republicans are appalled at what their party put out at the Republican Convention."
Ms. Michelman declined to say how much her group would spend, but she said its efforts would include polling on voter preferences and door-to-door canvassing, as well as "highly targeted media" efforts or direct mail.
 
To 'Shake Things Up'
 Officially, Mr. D'Amato's new 60-second commercial, which began airing yesterday in some markets and is to be heard statewide starting today, was merely a rebuttal to Mr. Abrams, who in his victory speech on election night said he wanted to go to Washington to "shake things up" while Mr. D'Amato had been "shaking people down."
But it was more than that. Having already begun tagging Mr. Abrams as "hopelessly liberal" in television commercials, Mr. D'Amato is now tring to paint him as a bully who beat up on Ms. Ferraro unfairly, which could hurt Mr. Abrams among the Catholic and white ethnic voters whose support he will need.
Mr. Abrams's press secretary, Timothy Gilles, said it was Mr. D'Amato himself who had first harshly attacked Ms. Ferraro, raising questions in August about a convicted labor racketeer who was a fund-raiser in her early Congressional years.
"Al D'Amato is the person who ran the mother of all negative campaigns in the history of New York State 12 years ago, when he attacked one of the most respected and revered figures in our state, Senator Jacob Javits, in a campaign that is still remembered as one of the nastiest and most brutally unfair in our history," Mr. Gilles said.
The perception that Mr. Abrams's attacks on Ms. Ferraro may have left a residue of ill-feeling among Democrats was noted yesterday by Governor Cuomo, who said he had spoken to Mr. Abrams and would support him "very strongly."
But Mr. Cuomo repeated his past criticism of the tone of the primary campaign and said it had invited Mr. D'Amato to make the very attacks he is now making. "He is so obviously vulnerable on the ethical issues that what you had to anticipate is exactly what he has done," Mr. Cuomo said. "As soon as you give him an excuse by being negative against another candidate, that's what he'll do.
"Our best chance to win is by arguing the economy," he added. "The worst thing is to get involved in a mudslinging campaign, because that will obscure the real issues. And when the mud from him obscures the message from you, that's a terrible mistake."
 
Talked With Ferraro
 The Governor said he had also spoken to Ms. Ferraro but had not urged her to concede.
"How could I?" he said. "What would I say? She says, 'I don't know if I've lost yet.' What you say to her is, 'Well, yeah, but you've likely lost.' "
Mr. Cuomo said Ms. Ferraro had asked whether Mr. Abrams would concede if he were in her shoes, especially since he had refused to rule out continuing on the Liberal Party line, which he already held, if he lost the Democratic primary. "And she made a good additional point. She said: 'There's nothing slowing him down from campaigning now. He is the Liberal Party candidate. What's he waiting for?' "

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Declines Broadly As Europe Stays in Turmoil

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday as turmoil continued in the European currency markets.
Currency traders said they had hoped the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, would cut its interest rates for the second time this week to bolster other currencies. But the Bundesbank took no action, helping to weaken the dollar. 
 But traders said the dollar's fall was primarily a byproduct of trading involving European currencies.
"The dollar is a second or third issue on the agenda right now," said John Nelson, a trader with ABN Amro Bank in New York. "The primary issue is the stability of the European Monetary System and its continued existence."
Gold prices also fell. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery cost $347.90 an ounce, down $1.90. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted the spot price of gold at $347.75, off $1.45.
The dollar failed to retain the safe-haven strength that it enjoyed on Wednesday. Investors often flee to dollar-denominated investments when the financial markets are in turmoil.
In London, the pound was quoted late yesterday at $1.7810, down from $1.8083 late Wednesday. It had been trading around $1.72 to $1.73 early in the day. In New York, the pound was trading at $1.7875 late yesterday, a bit stronger than $1.7855 the day before.
In European trading, the dollar was quoted at 1,228.00 lire, down from 1,246.50 lire late Wednesday. In New York, one dollar bought 1,239.25 lire, down from 1,257 lire.
Against the German mark in European trading, the dollar fell to 1.4820 marks from 1.5185 marks Wednesday. In New York, one dollar bought 1.4785 marks, down from 1.5140 marks.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.78 yen, up 0.48 yen from Wednesday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 124.35 yen. In New York, a dollar was worth 124.40 yen, down from 125.15 yen late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's rates, were: 1.2865 Swiss francs, down from 1.3230; 1.21525 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2236, and 5.0645 French francs, down from 5.1528.
In London, gold traded at a late bid price of $348.50 an ounce, unchanged from Wednesday as it reversed earlier gains of about $2 an ounce.
Silver traded in London at a bid of $3.80 an ounce, down from $3.83 on Wednesday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for current delivery fetched $3.766 an ounce, down from $3.821.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Grew in July; Imports Are Still Rising

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Acting a bit defiantly, the nation's merchandise trade deficit surged in July to $7.8 billion, the highest level in nearly two years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Imports rose, though exports remained at a robust level.
"It does not make sense that imports are rising," said Edward S. Hyman, president and chief economist of ISI Group, a Wall Street firm. "The weak dollar should make imported goods more expensive. The explanation is either that the American economy is stronger than it looks, or we don't make the goods that even a weak economy needs and we have to import them." 
 Despite the nearly stagnant United States economy, imports have been rising all year, and they went up by nearly $300 million in July, reaching a record $45.2 billion. The biggest increase was in consumer goods, which rose by $395.1 billion, and within that category diamonds accounted for nearly 30 percent of the rise.
 
Exports to Western Europe Fall
 The major weak spot was Western Europe, which buys roughly 30 percent of the nation's exported goods and services. There, the surplus of American exports over imports has been shrinking all year, and it fell by an additional $1.1 billion in July, reflecting the recession in much of Europe.
Exports totaled $37.3 billion, a decline of 2.2 percent from June's level of $38.2 billion, but still one of the highest monthly totals in recent years. Aside from the weakening sales in Western Europe -- they fell by nearly $900 million in August -- a big drop in the export of commercial aircraft contributed to the reduction of the nation's sales abroad.
Aircraft exports, which tend to rise sharply one month and fall just as sharply the next, fell by $898 million from June's level. Behind aircraft, exports of another capital goods item -- oil drilling and oilfield equipment -- also fell sharply, by $118 million.
Imported petroleum products, which pushed up the import bill earlier in the year, leveled off in July at $4.8 billion, the same level as in June.
 
Figures Often Fluctuate Widely
 "All of the trade numbers are volatile," said Haydn Mearkle, chief of trade data at the Census Bureau, which compiles the monthly merchandise trade reports. "You cannot just pick out one month and draw conclusions, although a lot of people try to do that."
Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee, said the July trade figures threw "more cold water" on President Bush's statement that the United States was an export superpower. But Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin said the July numbers supported that assertion.
While capital goods like aircraft, oilfield equipment and civilian aircraft engines did not sell as well abroad in July as they did in June, semiconductor sales rose by $181 million, and the nation's exports of industrial supplies also rose.
The American trade deficit with Japan, steadily widening all year, grew again slightly in July, to $46.26 billion from $46.13 billion in June, while the surplus of exports to Mexico over imports from that major trading partner grew in July, as it has all year, reaching $4.83 billion from $4.65 billion in June.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN EUROPE;
I.M.F. Chief Defends Central Bankers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The head of the International Monetary Fund went to bat today for central bankers humiliated by this week's crisis in European currency markets, asserting that the underlying reason for the chaos was less-than-stellar policy making by elected officials.
In a news conference, Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, singled out Germany's Government, saying its failure to rein in its huge budget deficit had virtually forced its central bank to raise interest rates. 
 And in an interview with a French newspaper, he urged the United States to play a more active role in calming Europe's market turbulence. Recognizing the powerful role the United States plays in the world economy, he said, "You cannot stabilize international markets without the cooperation of the United States."
 
'Not Enough on the Budget Side'
 The high German rates had forced other European countries, many of them in or near recession, to raise their rates to keep their currencies from falling against the mark. This week, despite large-scale central-bank intervention, the British pound, Italian lira and Spanish peseta, under the attack of currency speculators, had to be devalued.
"If we went through these tensions, it's probably because not enough was done on the budgetary side," Mr. Camdessus said.
He spoke two days before the world's central bankers and finance ministers gather here for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He also spoke two days before a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington.
Asked whether Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, has been too tough in raising its key rates above 9 percent to cut inflation, Mr. Camdessus responded: "I wouldn't say that. I would say that too much burden has been put on them."
Mr. Camdessus insisted that the European currency crisis could end up strengthening Europe's system of fixed exchange rates rather than weakening it.
"In spite of the formidable turmoil of the last few days, the system has once again demonstrated its remarkable resilience," he said.
In the interview with the French newspaper Les Echos, Mr. Camdessus asserted that the crisis in Europe stemmed in large part from the huge gap between America's low interest rates and Germany's stratospheric rates.
This gap pushed the mark so high that it became difficult for other European countries to keep their rates linked to the German currency. He criticized America's huge budget deficit, saying that because the deficit made it difficult for Washington to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy, the burden fell on the Federal Reserve to keep cutting rates.
 
U.S. Emphasizes Growth
 With the United States economy anemic for the last three years, the Bush Administration has been pressing other industrial nations to put more emphasis on growth. In a news briefing today, David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury, said he welcomed this week's currency devaluations as well as Monday's interest rate cut by the German central bank, saying they would help spur economic expansion worldwide.
Mr. Mulford said this week's actions showed the Europeans were finally backing the American approach.
The week's decisions in Europe "were very, very important," he said.
"They reflect a recognition of the consensus that has been building -- the United States has been promoting these views for about a year and a half now -- of the importance of strengthening world growth."
He said he was optimistic that Germany's central bank would cut rates again. "As you look forward, I think you can say that in due course in Germany, we will look forward to lower interest rates," he said. 'That's clearly the signal that they've sent." He added that the timing of that was "a complex matter."
Mr. Mulford said the United States had been "relatively unaffected" by Europe's currency crisis, although he expressed concern that turmoil in currency markets could spill over into other financial markets. But he said Europe again was stabilizing, so there was "a minimum of risk" for such financial market turmoil.
He said that at Saturday's Group of Seven meeting, the finance ministers would discuss developments in currency markets, as well as ways to spur world growth, help the developing world, and aid the former Soviet bloc as it adopted a market economy.
The seven ministers will meet with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister, Alexandr Shokhin, to discuss that nation's economic reforms, and they will also debate a plan to grant large-scale debt relief to Russia.
As Mr. Camdessus described it, the agenda for next week's I.M.F.-World Bank meeting will largely overlap that of the Group of Seven meeting. At the I.M.F. session, ministers will discuss how to end the economic doldrums in the industrialized world, how to help the former Communist world stabilize and grow, and, in his words, how to "consolidate and generalize the progress we observe in many developing countries."
Mr. Camdessus complained that many industrial countries had not pursued their commitments to get their economic houses in order. The I.M.F.'s World Economic Outlook, a semiannual report that was issued Wednesday, criticized the United States, Germany, Britain and Italy for not doing nearly enough to reduce their deficits. He said the large deficits were placing too much weight on central banks to run economic policy.
I.M.F. officials say the large deficits are slowing growth worldwide by pushing up long-term interest rates and by diverting money for consumption that could be used for private investment to build for the future.

HEADLINE: Hoping to Run With a Younger Crowd at OTB

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
A long way from the thundering hooves of the thoroughbreds they love, Mario and Helen Maurizio regularly make do with the next best thing: two seats and a table strategically placed between betting windows and closed-circuit television sets wired to the action.
After years of playing the horses, the sport of kings still races the Maurizios' hearts as it confounds their horse sense.
On almost every morning, Monday through Friday, the 58-year-old bookstore security guard and his 49-year-old wife travel the 40 blocks by city bus from their Yorkville home to Inside Track, a betting parlor one floor above the hustle of midtown Manhattan.
 
A Graying Foundation
 Situated on Second Avenue between 53d and 54th streets, Inside Track is the most profitable of the New York City Offtrack Betting Corporation's 95 branches, taking in more than $113,000 in government-sanctioned wagers each day. Much of that take, which is at least twice the average of most of the city's other legal betting parlors, is built on a graying foundation of regular patrons like the Maurizios.
A recent survey conducted by OTB found that in the majority of the city's betting branches in 1991, 68.5 percent of the patrons were over 45. That so many of OTB's best customers are older worries its top executives, especially since OTB had its smallest annual profit in history this year.
"We are spending energy now working to get a new age bracket of people coming in our branches," said David L. Vaughn, executive vice president of the corporation. "Right now we don't gear our ads and promotions for those folks between the ages of 25 and 44."
That, Mr. Vaughn promised, will soon change.
Current plans, he said, include upbeat campaigns to attract younger people to betting branches. The parlors themselves are being renovated with brighter and more spacious interiors, seating, snack foods and an essential feature missing in many of the city's betting establishments: bathrooms. Other plans include charity parties organized around offtrack betting, celebrity appearances in parlors and seminars intended to teach a new generation how to handicap horses.
As it is, Inside Track on Second Avenue is compact, with a capacity of 150. It has a small restaurant in the front and a glass-roofed lounge in the rear. Between those areas is a narrow section dominated by four bulletproof betting windows. Everywhere there is wood paneling and walls painted the deep green of Las Vegas felt.
At a glance, with its dozens of television sets mounted high and angled down, Inside Track has the look and feel of a retro-fitted disco, track lights and all.
 
'A Millionaires' Club'
 Many of the customers don't like to talk to strangers. Most that would talk to a reporter did so only on the condition that their names not be used. A regular, an 80-year-old man whose thin gray mustache appeared even thinner with the aid of black eyeliner, said he prefers to go to Inside Track rather than to an actual race track.
"When you get a certain age, it's a hassle to get there," he said.
But for the regulars, "it's like a millionaires' club around here," said Mrs. Maurizio, a large-framed woman who wears her hair pulled and tied on top of her head like a bright, blond mushroom cloud. "It's a very social atmosphere."
Unlike her husband, who must leave the parlor for his job at 4 P.M., Mrs. Maurizio usually stays, drinks coffee, smokes cigarettes and places their bets until the last race is over, at about 5 P.M. She does not stay for the harness racing that usually begins an hour later. "It's a different crowd," she said, without looking up from her racing forms.
Nearly everyone else in the branch during the day seems to know the Maurizios, and the regulars pass by their table to pay them regards. The group ranges from those favoring jeans and sneakers to the elegantly dressed elderly in well-tailored suits, handmade silk ties and spit-polished, expensive leather shoes.
House rules at Inside Track, one of two of OTB's showcase branches, require men to wear jackets and everyone to pay a $5 admission. The regulars say they like it because it keeps "the element" out, the homeless, alcoholics and pickpockets they say spoil many of the regular branches.
Aging customers are not OTB's only problem. The recession has also served to dampen the the gaming industry. OTB officials say that all types of gambling have been hurt by people with less discretionary income to wager, on horses or at blackjack tables. Overall, the agency took in $886.5 million in the fiscal year 1992, which ended on June 30. That was down from the previous take, or handle, of $920.8 million in 1991 and $959.2 million in 1990.
"That is a fact of life," Mr. Vaughn said. "What we have to do is concentrate on getting new dollars, new people, new interests."
Jerry McKeon, president of the New York Racing Association, a private nonprofit corporation that owns and operates horse-racing tracks in New York State, agreed that gambling has been hurt by the poor economy. But he placed more of the blame for OTB's tumbling revenues on the surcharges the agency puts on betting.
"The main reason is not the recession, it's the cost of wagering at offtrack operations," he said, noting that 18 cents out of every dollar wagered at the track is taken out for taxes, expenses and the racing industry, while 23 cents is taken out of every dollar wagered in an offtrack parlor.
 
A City Surcharge
 The additional 5 cents goes for a surcharge to the city from offtrack betting, said Marjorie W. Longley, a spokeswoman. "That is money that goes directly to the city," she said. "It cannot be touched by OTB."
Last fiscal year the surchange raised $25.7 million that went into the city's general fund, Ms. Longley said.
Inside Track, one of two branches that charge admission and are thus permitted to forgo the surcharge, is among the betting parlors that OTB plans to upgrade. Plans are to move Inside Track by the first of next year to a more spacious location a block south on Second Avenue, Ms. Longley said. "Construction is going to begin in about three weeks," she said.
In the meantime, the patrons of Inside Track continue to pack the place every day. On each of those days they bet an average of $600 and yell every 30 minutes for their horses in an atonal chorus of English, Spanish, Chinese, Italian, Greek and Polish. Losers whisper curses as they rip and discard their losing betting tickets.
"Nobody wins at horses," said Mr. Maurizio, who began betting on horses when he was 14 years old, growing up in Queens. "Nobody has ever beaten the horses."
While she always aims to win, Mrs. Maurizio said, she also strives to be a gracious loser.
 
The Action at Belmont
 Earlier this week, the Maurizios joined the action at Belmont at Inside Track through closed-circuit "simulcasting."
Also there was Bob Lassaw, who looked like a tall Bob Costas dressed in a straw-colored sports coat, neatly pressed jeans and an open-collar cotton shirt. Said by many to be the best handicapper in the house, he was flanked by bettors who hung on his every word.
Cool and professional, he talked quietly while studying the stream of racing information on the parlor's various screens and in newspapers piled in his lap. Once the bets were made, he returned to his seat, chatting quietly until the parlor's shades were automatically drawn and the house lights dimmed, seconds before each race.
With the sound of the starting gate and the sight of horses charging for the rail shown on the lounge's oversize projection television, the opening seconds of the race drew Mr. Lassaw slowly to his feet.
A few more seconds into the race and he was rocking on the soles of his expensive sneakers. By the time the horses nosed their way to the finish wire, pockets of otherwise calm and civilized people like Mr. Lassaw were bouncing, pacing, pleading and snapping their fingers at the screens in loud incantations of hope mixed with luck.
"It's an interesting crew that comes here," said Mr. Lassaw, 40 years old, who says he tries to make a living by betting the horses. "There's a bunch of wound-up cookies here."
As he spoke, the winners collected their money. The losers sharpened their pencils and the parlor suddenly fell as silent as a college library. Heads well versed in the physics of horse flesh on track sod concentrated once again.
"I can pick the best horse in every race," Mario Maurizio said philosophically. "But that doesn't mean it's going to win."

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Sept. 17

 BODY:
After the week's high drama and big talk, millions of Europeans faced the icy realization today that the mystifying crisis on their money markets had come down to something alarmingly simple: cancel the dinner reservation, forget the theater tickets, postpone the vacation and don't even begin to think about the new compact sedan in the dealership.
With some obvious exceptions -- Germans shielded by their invincible marks and tour operators and exporters praying for a slice of them -- many sense that this week's devaluation of the British pound, the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta will push up their inflation rates, make imports and foreign travel more expensive and bring them up short against tough options. 
 And, for all the politicians' talk of Europe's very destiny being molded in a crucible of big money and gung-ho speculation, the concerns, particularly of middle-class Europeans, seemed far more to reflect the worry that life's little extras -- the very stuff of comfort and status -- risked becoming life's burdens.
 
Fewer Dinners in Restaurants
 "I'll stop going out for dinner and learn how to cook and stay home more," said Luigi Antonelli, a 35-year-old engineer in Rome. "And I'll have to avoid superfluous things like the cinema and the theater."
Jose Paniagua, a 52-year-old Spaniard dealing in imported French cars, said: "This is the biggest crisis in my entire business career. My business has been doing badly for two years, but this is the coup de grace. Customers will not want to buy now, because they are worried about the economy. People will rather wait and see before buying a new car or even a good used one. This is a disaster."
Referring to the complexities of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, Dominic Gray, a 32-year-old camera store manager in London, said: "The E.R.M.? I haven't the faintest idea how it works. I haven't a clue. But I know bad news when I see it."
Interviews with people in Rome, Paris, London, Madrid and Bonn suggested that like Mr. Gray many found the inner workings of the fickle currency markets incomprehensible but understood only too well the impact on their pocketbooks.
On Wednesday, for instance, the British authorities raised interest rates twice before reducing them again today to their old level of 10 percent. The alarm was instantaneous, because British mortgages for home purchases, unlike those in the United States, are instantly adjustable to prevailing interest rates.
 
Effect on Mortgages
 "My daughter was on the phone yesterday asking me: 'What are we going to do? How are we going to pay the mortgage?' " Wendy Kehoe said at a leather goods store in London. The British, she said, understand the effect of increases in interest rates "much better than exchange mechanisms or parity or whatever."
Nick Nicolaides, a tax accountant in London, said: "I couldn't believe my ears when I heard what had happened with interest rates. I thought they had gotten caught up in some sort of Monopoly game. Let's raise rates by 2 percent, 5 percent. Who cares?"
While people in Britain seemed relieved at the subsequent reduction in interest rates, many still felt that the current economic slide, long predating the turmoil on the exchange markets, was far from over.
"The economy has been going steadily down," said Mark Galvin, a 25-year-old British bicycle messenger. "You'd think it would get better. But then things like yesterday happen."
If he seemed resigned, some veered closer to the apocalyptic. "It's going to make me re-evaluate all my plans, my decision to start a family," said Gianpiero Mazzoni, a 33-year-old engineer in Rome. "I've just married, and I couldn't have chosen a worse time, a more negative climate, and that's a drama.
"My daily life will be hardest hit. I won't be able to change cars. I'll go less to the theater, to the movies, out for dinner. I've even decided to stop smoking."
 
The Eye of the Monetary Storm
 The crisis on the money markets was touched off by uncertainty over the outcome of Sunday's referendum in France on European unity. Yet, in Paris, at the epicenter of the crisis, currency markets have not moved significantly, and attention is far more focused on Sunday's vote than on the turmoil it has unleashed.
"All these things are above me," said Pierre Levi, a drugstore owner near the Paris Opera. "I don't understand anything of these matters. There are no changes so far. And it's hard to predict."
If Europe's cloud has a kind of silver lining, it is denominated in dollars and German marks. "Americans make up a large portion of my clientele and they will now have larger purchasing power, so for my business it's good news, but for the country in general it's bad," said Miguel Bajo at his souvenir store in Madrid opposite the Prado museum.
At an American Express office in Madrid, Maria Angeles Juan said, "It's been a madhouse this morning with all the tourists cashing in dollars at a higher rate."
Spanish exporters of luxury goods like marble and sparkling champagne seemed overjoyed at the devaluation of their currency, because it meant that their goods would be cheaper for foreign buyers. "We are delighted with the news," said Jose Ferrer Sala, the chairman of Spain's largest sparkling wine producer.
 
In Germany, Glee and Caution
 The glee extended to Germany, too.
"The German tourist and consumer has the last laugh," said Helmut Wienholt, a German business spokesman in Cologne. "The stronger the mark, the more favorable it is for us to buy abroad."
The mark's strength against the dollar, while it hurts German exporters by making their products more expensive, could well bring some windfalls to Americans. "It may be that people will take an autumn holiday in the Dolomites in Italy," a travel specialist in Munich said. "But Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami are the real hot destinations for winter holidays."
Reflecting their country's familiarity with their buying power in other European lands, several Germans in random interviews on the streets of Bonn said the devaluations would not really make much difference to them, and some worried that they might be seen as exploiters if they vaunted their wealth.
"I wouldn't make use of the difference in currency rates for something like a shopping trip, because I see Europe as a unity," said Helga Payerle, a 40-year-old bank teller in Bonn. "It would not be correct to milk the system."
But there seemed little doubt from interviews in other European countries that the mark's strength and the German central bank's effort to keep it strong had fueled old resentments of Bonn's economic power -- or at least had inspired some dark humor about it.
"Do you know how to speak German?" one man was overheard asking the conductor on a London bus today. "No," replied the conductor.
"Well, you'd better learn, because they'll be running the country soon," the other man said.

HEADLINE: Top Officers In New Posts At Times Co.

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that Lance R. Primis had been promoted to president and chief operating officer and that Walter E. Mattson, who had held those positions since 1979, had been named vice chairman.
The two men will join Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman and chief executive, in a newly created office of the chairman, Mr. Sulzberger said. Mr. Mattson's main job will be to work with Mr. Sulzberger on strategic planning. 
 Mr. Mattson, who is 60 years old, had wanted to step aside from management of operations earlier but had stayed because of delays in opening The New York Times's new automated color printing and distribution plant in Edison, N.J., Mr. Sulzberger said. The opening of the $450 million plant, delayed by negotiations with unions over staffing levels, is now scheduled for the end of this month, more than a year and a half after construction was completed.
Mr. Primis, 46, has been the newspaper's president and general manager since 1988. His position is being kept open temporarily, said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times. The newspaper's senior business managers will report to the publisher for now, as the top editors already do.
The job that Mr. Primis inherits is much broader in scope than it was when Mr. Mattson took over, because of the large number of acquisitions that Mr. Mattson oversaw. In addition to The Times, the Times Company owns 31 regional newspapers, 18 women's and sports/leisure magazines, 13 single-topic publications, 5 television stations, 2 radio stations, a news service and several smaller information services, interests in 3 paper mills and a 50 percent stake in The International Herald Tribune, the daily newspaper published in Paris with the Washington Post Company.
Mr. Mattson developed a reputation as a detail-oriented, high-energy executive with an abiding love for every aspect of the newspaper business. That attachment is rooted in childhood days, which were spent working in his native Erie, Pa., on an uncle's weekly newspaper.
After completing undergraduate work at the University of Maine, Mr. Mattson received an electrical engineering degree from Northeastern University. Starting as a printer, he held a variety of newspaper jobs in Maine, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, and served as a consultant in graphic arts before joining The Times in 1960 as assistant to the production manager. By 1974, he had risen to the position of general manager of The Times, responsible for all business operations.
 
Maintaining Good Will
 Mr. Mattson became popular on Wall Street during the early 1980's as he oversaw a period of rapid expansion and profit growth, and he managed to maintain that good will even when the financial performance of the company weakened later in the decade. "He always told it like it was," said John Reidy, a media industry analyst at the brokerage firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
Mr. Reidy said yesterday's announcement was something of a surprise, given Mr. Mattson's good health. But, he added, investors would take it as a sign that the company believed its operations were in good shape and that Mr. Primis was ready for promotion.
On the American Stock Exchange yesterday, the Times Company's stock rose 87.5 cents, to $28.125.
The senior Mr. Sulzberger praised Mr. Mattson yesterday for a "firm hand and keen understanding" that had helped the company weather the current economic downturn and prepare for renewed growth.
 
The Likely Successor
 Mr. Primis had long been regarded as Mr. Mattson's likely successor by industry analysts. He has risen rapidly through the company's management ranks since joining in 1969 as a classified advertising salesman. Mr. Primis was born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island. He was an English major at the University of Wisconsin, graduating in 1968.
With Mr. Sulzberger Jr., Mr. Primis has been a prime advocate of applying the quality-assurance theories of W. Edwards Deming to the business operations of the company. In an interview in Adweek magazine earlier this year, Mr. Primis said he became fascinated in 1989 with Dr. Deming's insistence on the importance of measuring and achieving quality in all aspects of business. He told Adweek that a year of declining revenues after the 1987 stock market crash convinced him that the management style that had worked during the years of rapid growth needed to be overhauled.
Yesterday, Mr. Mattson was traveling and unavailable for comment, and Mr. Primis declined to elaborate on their new jobs, said Nancy Nielsen, a company spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: James Glanville, General Partner In Lazard Freres, Is Dead at 69

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
James W. Glanville, a Wall Street investment banker and general partner in the firm of Lazard Freres & Company, died on Wednesday at Methodist Hospital in Houston. A former resident of Darien, Conn., he was 69 years old and lived in Houston.
He died of injuries suffered in a recent automobile accident, his family said. 
 He was a banker to the petroleum, chemical and natural-resource industries for the last three decades and a director of several large corporations. He became a partner of Lazard Freres in 1978, having been a partner and managing director of Lehman Brothers for the preceding 15 years. He also was a major Lehman shareholder.
Mr. Glanville, a native of Cooper, Tex., grew up in Dallas and graduated in 1944 from Rice University with a major in chemical engineering. He received a Master of Science degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1946 and a professional degree of chemical engineering two years later.
 
Field Petroleum Engineer
 Before starting his career on Wall Street, Mr. Glanville was a professional engineer and worked in Texas as a field petroleum engineer for Humble Oil. At Humble he held a number of positions, including that of reservoir engineer for the Gulf Coast division. He also was the author of technical papers and books on hydrocarbon behavior, reservoir engineering and the economics of the oil industry.
As an investment banker, Mr. Glanville saw his reputation grow from decades of relationships with major companies and his broad knowledge of their industries. He was a personal adviser to their senior executives and was fond of saying, "My clients are my friends."
Together With Michel David-Weill of Lazard Freres, who came from Paris to assume the mantle of Andre Meyer, and other senior executives, Mr. Glanville played a role in a period of robust expansion of the firm's investment banking business.
At the time of his death, he was a member of the boards of several companies, including Halliburton, Compaq Computer, Imcera, Minorco (U.S.A.) and Sterling Chemicals.
Mr. Glanville was a governor of his alma mater, Rice University, where he was visiting professor of investment banking at the business school. He was a past trustee of the California Institute of Technology and currently was chairman of its capital campaign as well as its finance committee.
In Houston, he was a trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Houston Museum of Natural Science. He previously served on the board of directors of the Town of Darien Library.
He is survived by his wife, Nancy; and four sons, John of Pasadena, Calif., Charles of London, Thomas of Houston and Robert of Moscow.

HEADLINE: Jobless Benefit Claims Rise by 6,000 in Week

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits totaled 400,000 in early September, the most in a month and a level some analysts said would be maintained for the rest of the year.
The Labor Department reported today that first-time applications for unemployment insurance rose by 6,000 in the week ended Sept. 5 to their highest level since 474,000 in the week ended Aug. 8. 
 "We're not going to see any improvement until 1993 and we could even see deterioration," said Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster in St. Louis.
Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic counselor for DRI/McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting service, concurred.
 
'A Vicious Circle'
 "It's not going to get better until the economy surges and it's hard to see how the economy will get better unless we get more jobs," Mr. Chimerine said. "It's a vicious circle."
The Labor Department said the latest increase was due in part to the effects of a nine-day strike at a General Motors parts plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and to laid-off workers prevented from filing claims earlier by Hurricane Andrew.
Still, the increase may have been even larger than reported. The department has cautioned that recent claims are underreported because some laid-off workers are using an emergency unemployment program not counted in its weekly release.
The four-week moving average of claims dropped to 390,750 in the period ended Sept. 5, from 409,250 a week earlier, to the lowest level since the 387,250 reached in the period ended Oct. 6, 1990.
Many analysts prefer to track the four-week average because it smooths out the volatility of the weekly reports and is considered a more reliable indicator of the labor market.
Claims had been held down by Hurricane Andrew in the Aug. 29 reporting period because the storm had forced the closing of several Florida unemployment offices. In the latest period, however, Florida reported 2,553 layoffs, in part because of the reopening of the offices.
The overall national figures are adjusted for seasonal variations but the state figures are not.

HEADLINE: Herbal Ambassadors Discuss Natural Medicine

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
Hortense Robinson, a midwife and healer from Belize, stood beneath a banana tree in the Enid Haupt Conservatory of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx this week, explaining that its root staunches the hemorrhaging that can sometimes take the life of a woman who has just given birth.
Just wash the root, grate it and squeeze out the juice, she said. Give the woman one tablespoon. If the bleeding doesn't stop in a few minutes -- hemorrhaging can be fatal -- give her another tablespoon. 
 "It's a very powerful astringent, and just recently, it saved the life of a woman in a village outside of Belize," said Dr. Rosita Arvigo, an herbalist from Chicago who has lived in Belize for the last 12 years, studying with traditional healers like Ms. Robinson, and recording their medicinal uses of native plants.
"We train a lot of community health volunteers how to use it, because in Belize, synthetic medicine is often not available, or doctors are too far away," said Dr. Arvigo, who is a doctor of naprapathy, a Czechoslovak form of chiropractic. She is also the president of the Ix Chei Tropical Research Center (named after Ix Chel, the Mayan goddess of medicine) near San Ignacio, Belize.
 
Public Discussion
 Both Ms. Robinson and Dr. Arvigo will be at the conservatory tomorrow and Sunday afternoon, from 1:30 to 4 P.M., discussing the medicinal uses of many of the plants that can be seen at the "Green Treasures" exhibition, which features more than 100 plants from the tropical rain forest valued for their medicinal properties as well as for food and fuel.
At 1, 2 and 3 P.M., Dr. Scott Mori, a tropical botanist from the garden, will show how scientists work in the field, identifying and collecting samples from plants. Visitors can also sample fruit juices from the tropics, and listen to a Caribbean steel-drum band outside the conservatory.
The exhibition, which runs through Oct. 25, focuses on the importance of tropical species, many of them unidentified, as the world's tropical rain forests continue to dwindle at an alarming rate: every year, an area the size of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut combined is destroyed.
Rain forests occupy only 2 percent of the earth's surface -- but are home to half of all plant and animal species. About 120 prescription medicines come from plants, the show points out, and more than one-third of these come from the rain forest. Yet fewer than 1 percent of rain-forest plants have been studied for their useful properties. Many of the old folk remedies, handed down by word of mouth, are dying out with the healers.
"We are trying to save and record that information," Dr. Arvigo said, "and serve as a bridge between the often disparate world of science and experience. The health of human beings has always been the special charge of plants, and we are their ambassadors."
Dr. Arvigo works closely with Dr. Michael Balick, director of the New York Botanical Garden's Institute of Economic Botany, who is also a co-founder of the Ix Chel Tropical Research Center. Her husband, Dr. Gregory Shropshire, a homeopathic physician, is the third co-founder.
For five years, the three have been working with herbal healers in Belize to inventory 750 local plant species that have long been used for medicine, food and fiber. "The Belize Ethnobotany Project," as it is called, is sponsored by the United States Agency for International Aid, with support from the National Cancer Institute, Metropolitan Life Foundation and the Belize Government. Dr. Balick is a principal investigator for the National Cancer Institute's international search for plants that could be therapeutic for the victims of cancer or AIDS.
Ms. Robinson, 64 years old, whose ancestors are from Africa, Ireland and India, grew up in Cozumel, in a Mexican "chicle" camp -- when workers still collected the chicle, or latex, from the local achras zapota trees to make chewing gum. She moved to Belize when she was 15, and began to carry on the healing and midwifery arts of her mother and grandmother. Her own daughter, Concepcion Velasquez, is one of the few younger women still interested in learning the ancient ways.
Ms. Robinson leases 50 acres from the Belize Government to nurture and use the plants she needs for healing -- yet many, especially the hardwoods, are often poached from the forest.
 
Pain Relievers
 She wandered about the conservatory, pointing out the curative powers of plants as common as Dracaena, whose leaves are crushed and steeped for a tea that alleviates asthma. Spanish moss is boiled with garlic cloves, to relieve an asthmatic's chest pains. Anthurium is used to soothe the pain of rheumatism and arthritis.
"You cut up the leaves and boil it in a pot and have the person sit over it in a chair with a blanket," Dr. Arvigo said. "The person sweats and the medicinal properties enter the body through the open pores."
Or, said Ms. Robinson, suppose you are walking in the jungle and develop a cramp in your leg, an aching back, a stiff neck. "You take the leaf and wrap it around your neck or your back and at the end of the day, just peel it off," she said.
For more secrets from the rain forest, you may talk to the healers this weekend. The conservatory will be open tomorrow and Sunday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. at the garden, 200th Street and Southern Boulevard, Fordham. Garden admission: $3; $2 for students and the elderly; children under 6, free. Metro-North offers a discount package including round trip from Grand Central Terminal and admission to the garden for $7.25. Information: (800) 638-7646 or 532-4900 in New York City. The Botanical Garden operates a shuttle van from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History. Garden information and shuttle reservations: (212) 220-8700.

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov

 BODY:
Courage is a fine thing in a restaurant owner. The courage to open during a recession. The courage to choose an unusual location. The courage to offer unconventional dishes.
Like jalapenos stuffed with peanut butter. 
 Peanut butter?
"One of my chefs made it one night," said John Bausert, the owner of this stylish new Mexican restaurant in SoHo, on the site of the defunct Onda. "It's my son's favorite thing in the whole world."
Peanut butter notwithstanding, Mr. Bausert's courage extends beyond his menu. He had no restaurant experience before opening La Frontera in July, having made his living caning chairs and repairing furniture. The handsome rectangular dining room, with its paneled walls and wooden floors, is proof of his past life: he polished all the woodwork himself. But while Mr. Bausert says he loves to cook, he is not foolhardy. He hired two experienced Mexican chefs to do most of the cooking, reserving the desserts for himself.
La Frontera offers a little more elegance than the usual enchiladas-and-frozen-margaritas joint: linen tablecloths and napkins, waiters in smart black vests and bow ties, guacamole prepared tableside, and quiet music in the background. With the menu comes a basket of fresh, warm tortilla chips with two contrasting salsas: a chunky-tomato hot sauce and a bright tomato, onion and pepper relish, plus a glassful of addictive cheddar-and-jalapeno breadsticks.
A little glass bowl of ceviche ($4.95), cubes of raw red snapper and shrimp marinated in lime juice and served cool with tomato and chilies, was a refreshing way to begin. The casa burrito ($11.50), an unlikely combination of black beans, grilled turkey and slender orange sections, was delicious as an appetizer shared by several people, the cool fruit an excellent contrast to the meat. On the other hand, nachos ($5.95), arranged in an unusually neat manner, were completely unbalanced, with the melted cheese obscuring any evidence of beans or peppers.
It's never easy to find good mole poblano sauce, that mysterious, spicy, chocolatey Mexican specialty, but La Frontera's version is a winner, harmoniously peppery and minty and served over a well-cooked half-chicken ($13.50). Pollo asado, a grilled boneless chicken breast, was slightly overcooked but redeemed by a mound of mango-avocado salsa ($12.50). Beef fajitas ($13.95), tender strips of marinated steak sauteed with onions, peppers and tomatoes and served with fresh tortillas, arrived still sizzling in a little iron pan. Shrimp in garlic, parsley and wine ($14.95) smelled heavenly, but the shrimp were over-cooked.
La Frontera has just gotten its liquor license and is putting together a selection of about 20 wines and an array of Mexican beers.
Mr. Bausert takes pride in his dessert tray, mostly his own creations. Chocolate creme brulee ($3.75) was appropriately deadly, while a quesillo ($3.75), an eggy flan-like dessert made with sweetened condensed milk and drizzled with caramel syrup, was surprisingly light and tasty.
Oh, and the jalapenos stuffed with peanut butter? Let's just put it this way: courage has its limitations; even jelly won't help this.

Boy Sues for the Right to Pick His Own Parents

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
If you've been wondering what Patrick J. Buchanan was talking about last month when he told the Republican National Convention that Hillary Clinton believes that 12-year-olds should have the right to sue their parents, you can get the details tonight in an affecting report that takes up most of "20/20."
The issue, as Barbara Walters phrases it, is a novel one: "If a child claims he's been abused, abandoned or neglected by his parents, can he take matters into his own hands?" She goes on to interview all the principals in a case that has already set legal precedent: a Florida boy is seeking a divorce from his parents so that he can be adopted by his foster parents. The trial starts in Florida next week. 
 Gregory K., as the 12-year-old boy is called in the lawsuit and on the program, has been in foster homes for most of his life. His natural parents have lived apart for almost 10 years, and Gregory has spent only about 7 months of the last 8 years with the mother who is now fighting to retain the custody she so rarely exercised. The father says he has resigned himself to letting Gregory make his own choice.
The mother, who is on welfare, is now living with her two other children and a boyfriend who, on at least one recent occasion, gave her a severe beating. By contrast, the couple whom Gregory wants to call mother and father are well to do and have eight children of their own; to judge by the scenes here, they make a welcoming family.
Gregory, who comes across as a remarkably mature and eloquent boy, tells Ms. Walters: "I just want a place where I will feel safe and that I'm happy, and that I know people will always be there for me." Neither Ms. Walters nor the viewer can be sure that he has not been coached by his lawyer or that he is not being lured away, as his mother suggests, by the promise of a more comfortable life. His appearance tonight may be a tactic in the custody fight. But Gregory surely seems to be his own young man.
His mother, whose sudden desire to have him with her after so many years of showing little interest, is less convincing and much less appealing. Her lawyer's argument against "pitting the preservation of the family against what children want" raises the question of whether every family is worth preserving.
Deciding a case from this sort of report is chancy. But after meeting Gregory and those who are fighting over him, few viewers are likely to come away as sure as Mr. Buchanan seemed to be that there are no circumstances under which a 12-year-old should have the right to protect his future.
 
'A House Divided'
CNN, Sunday at 10 P.M.
Although "A House Divided" finds glimmers of light in the dark landscape of America's inner cities, Sunday's report from CNN seems more wishful than hopeful.
This first hour of a three-hour series, "The Nation's Agenda" (which in turn is part of "Democracy in America," the cable network's coverage of the 1992 conventions, which is more than enough titles for now), begins with a forceful if familiar picture of the condition of black and Hispanic residents of cities throughout the United States. The elements include, alas, unemployment, crime, school dropouts, fatherless families, drugs and disarray.
The reporters, Norma Quarles and Kathy Slobogin, concentrate on the plight of mothers and fathers trying to raise children in neighborhoods where, as a Chicago boy says, being in the wrong place at the wrong time can be fatal. Through interviews in largely black Detroit and the largely white suburb of nearby Macomb County, they show that black families fear black criminals as much as whites do, but do not enjoy the luxury of being able to move out of the line of fire.
The focus here is on a few efforts to save minority families, and especially the young, from being trapped for life:
*In Chicago, over a 15-year period, 4,000 families have been moved to integrated neighborhoods; 90 percent of the children are said to be in college or at work. Ms. Slobogin emphasizes that the cost to the city of moving a family is about half the cost of keeping it in public housing.
*Hundreds of welfare mothers have been placed in jobs paying about $14,000 a year by a company that operates in New York and Connecticut. Ms. Quarles points out that the state subsidy is less than a quarter of the cost of keeping the women on welfare.
*An innovative junior high school in East Harlem is reported to have improved test scores and dramatically increased the number of students being accepted by New York City's best high schools. The principal says such results have been achieved without extra money from the city budget.
*Volunteers in San Francisco are shown helping to turn high school dropouts into college graduates.
The stories might be more heartening if the reporting were tougher. Most of the information comes from advocates of the plans, and at times the reporters sound as though they are delivering commercials. But to take such accounts, which have been popping up frequently on television, at face value, a new, bitterly gained realism is at work. By concentrating on helping those who show signs of being able to help themselves, America's best-intentioned innovators have been driven to practicing triage.

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
World League and Expansion Are Put on Pause

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRAPEVINE, Tex., Sept. 17

 BODY:
The World League was suspended for one year by the National Football League owners here today. And when the World League returns in 1994, it will offer a decidedly more European flavor.
In other N.F.L. business, the owners' squashed their original timetable for expansion -- the final two sites will not be named next month, and the expansion teams will not begin play in the 1994 season. That decision was reached largely because of labor unrest, which the league said it hoped to resolve by emphasizing more negotiation with the players than more court action. It was the first time the owners have met since a court ruling last week declared the league's Plan B free agency illegal under antitrust law. 
 The decision to put the World League on hold for a year was a mild surprise for some because the N.F.L., for each of the last two years, had subsidized the league and had just begun to enjoy the benefits of a new player pool that the league had offered.
"The World League was very successful in Europe and we feel that an international focus instead of one in middle-sized America is the way to go," said Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner.
Neil Austrian, president of the N.F.L., added: "None of the American teams had been profitable up to this point. We divorced the World League situation from the legal situation we're in with labor. It's a situation where you look at the marketplace and you've got a recession here and in Europe. It makes sense to take a breath and come back at it. There are probably a lot of things that we can do better with the World League than we've done."
The World League featured 10 teams, three in Europe (Barcelona, Spain; Frankfurt and London), six in the United States (Columbus, Ohio; New York; Orlando, Fla.; Birmingham, San Antonio and Sacramento) and one in Canada (Montreal). A revamped World League in 1994 might include only three to five teams from the United States and several more in Europe, particularly in countries where teams already exist so natural rivalries can flourish.
"I personally would like to have seen the World League go on because we've got two players from the league on our team, so it does work and has some quality," said Wellington Mara, a Giants' co-owner. "But when we talked about the economics of it and looked at the global picture, it was a very strong case made for stepping back."
As for N.F.L. expansion, five cities -- Baltimore, St. Louis, Jacksonville, Fla.; Charlotte, N.C., and Memphis -- awaited word today to see whether the owners would stay on schedule and name the two recipients of N.F.L. teams next month. But the owners, however, said today that the earliest expansion could occur would now be in 1995 and that the owners were not prepared to name the two cities any time soon.
Tagliabue said the labor woes the league is undergoing are not conducive to expansion for the new cities.
The owners listened to their lawyers explain the jury's decision last week that struck down the Plan B free agency system. The owners left believing the verdict was a split decision because, they contend, the jury found that some type of rules to maintain competitive balance were legal.
Tagliabue said there was no current effort by the owners to implement a new supplementary free-agency system. He said the owners' coming actions will be predicated on United States District Judge David Doty's ruling on what system will be allowed for 1993. Another round of player contracts expire on Feb. 1, and the appeals process may still be under way. In the next 30 days, Doty is expected to rule on what to do with the players whose contracts will expire on Feb. 1. On Tuesday, he will rule on the group of players whose contracts expired when the jury ruled Plan B was illegal.
"There was no discussion of a Plan C or anything else like that, but we should move toward a Plan A, with 'A' standing for agreement," Tagliabue said. "Let's keep the pie growing. People tend to move swiftly in terms of their emotions. I think when you start talking about things off the table, that's pointless. We can't even find the table at this point."
 
Close, but No Agreement
 Mara said the negotiations with the players, at times, have been positive.
"Several times we were very close to an agreement, and I believe the last time it didn't work because the agents moved in and took over and were very much against a hard salary cap," Mara said. "There were parts of the jury's decision that we don't want to appeal and parts that we do. What the judge does in the next 30 days will be critical to what we do."
The owners meet again to address these and other issues on Oct. 20 in Chicago.

Religious Bigotry At a 1950's Prep School

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
In "School Ties," a tale of anti-Semitism geared to the "Dead Poets Society" crowd, the film's Jewish hero quietly removes the gold Star of David that he wears around his neck and hides it in a box of Band-Aids. In a drama like this, the worst-case scenario would have a classmate later skinning his knee and reaching for the Band-Aids, thus letting the cat out of the bag.
At least that doesn't happen. Though much of "School Ties" follows a predictable path, this film does manage a few surprises, particularly those surrounding David Greene (Brendan Fraser), the story's exemplary hero. David is smart, handsome and the star of the school's football team. This means he is not the sort to behave philosophically once he experiences religious discrimination at a prestigious New England prep school during the mid-1950's. Indeed, David's habit of grabbing, berating or otherwise challenging anyone who insults him gives "School Ties" a muscular quality not usually found in films about this subject. It hardly hurts that the director, Robert Mandel, stages one of David's most significant brawls with his classmates in a communal shower. 
 Mr. Fraser, who played the subverbal title role in "Encino Man," emerges from the primordial slime of that film as a very appealing leading man. Cast this time as an intelligent, well-groomed hunk, Mr. Fraser makes David believable even when the film seems to indicate otherwise. David's home life in Scranton, Pa., is presented ludicrously, as he fights off anti-Semitic bikers who look like male models. David's father is seen only briefly and is played by Ed Lauter, surely one of the last actors an audience might expect to hear speaking Yiddish. Later on, David recalls watching two strangers foraging for tin cans in a garbage dump and hearing his father say, "Davy, it's an honest living."
Without having made a plausible case for either David's working-class background or his Jewish roots, the film sends him to a snobbish New England boys' school on a football scholarship. "Is there anything you can't eat?" asks the coach (Kevin Tighe) when David arrives. "Just play your cards close to the vest, that's my advice," this coach continues, with the same sledgehammer delicacy. "Don't tell people more than they need to know."
So David stands by, looking chagrined, while his new classmates crack anti-Semitic jokes and speculate about their own futures at Ivy League colleges. (Each one has a family mandate to follow his ancestors' footsteps at Harvard, Princeton or Yale.) "I wouldn't go to Harvard if you paid me," one teases another. "All those Jews and Communists," he adds. Another classmate chimes in, "Yeah, and that's just the faculty."
The film, which gets its ethnic and economic snobbery mixed up, imagines that David's relative poverty would cause no problems in this setting; only his Jewish lineage, when it is finally made public, becomes a source of trouble. Meanwhile, David has picked up the expected accouterments of a pretty blond girlfriend (Amy Locane) whose religious tolerance goes no deeper than her pageboy hairdo and a bigoted friend (Matt Damon) whose prejudice masks his fears about his own inadequacies.
The screenplay, by Dick Wolf and Darryl Ponicsan, occasionally presents David with interesting and slightly unexpected dilemmas. What does he do about the fact that an important game falls on Rosh ha-Shanah, a day when Jewish law prohibits anyone from playing quarterback? The film's ending also has the potential for presenting David with a significant ethical question, and leads to a mildly surprising resolution.
"School Ties" has a leafy, genteel look that is somehow less than convincing, perhaps because the hairdos are too tidy and the resemblances to other prep-school stories too clear. Some good young actors, including Randall Batinkoff as the football-team captain and Chris O'Donnell in a standard nice-guy role, do what they can to enliven these surroundings. So does Zeljko Ivanek, gleefully overplaying the role of a bow-tie-wearing sadist who teaches French.

 	 	 		. . .	 	"School Ties" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild profanity and discreet nudity.

HEADLINE: The Paper That Won't Drop Dead

 BODY:
Few newspapers have endured more reversals than The Daily News of New York. Few have shown greater resilience.
First came a bitter five-month strike, which destroyed circulation and advertising. Then came Robert Maxwell, whose image as a savior unraveled when, after his apparent suicide, his empire was exposed as a hollow shell. 
 Still The News kept going, though its employees had every reason to give up. Labor strife set friend against friend. The discovery that the paper was merely a pawn in Mr. Maxwell's desperate financial game was devastating.
Now, however, perseverance may yield its reward. Mortimer Zuckerman has offered to buy and rebuild the paper. The deal is not done but it is clearly within reach.
A settlement does not, of course, guarantee survival -- despite the cost-saving concessions Mr. Zuckerman has extracted from the unions and his promise to supply fresh capital. Circulation sank from a pre-strike level of 1.2 million to 300,000 before Mr. Maxwell's arrival. Today it's about 800,000.
Where did the other readers go, and can enough of them be recovered to make the paper profitable again? Is Mr. Zuckerman prepared to weather the recession that has weakened New York City's economy and newspaper advertising?
These are daunting questions. For the moment, however, they are outweighed by the sudden rush of hope. The proposed bargain holds the promise of preserving a vigorous voice in an era of fewer and fewer newspapers.
And what a brash and brassy voice it has been -- few can forget the headline "Ford to City: Drop Dead." The News has amused, challenged and enlightened New Yorkers for years, just as it has kept its competitors alert. With any luck, it will continue to do so.

HEADLINE: Europe, One Way or Another

 BODY:
The chaos that struck European financial markets this week was inevitable. European Community countries have linked their currencies in a system of fixed exchange rates. But they have also jealously protected their right to pursue irreconcilable domestic policies.
Germany borrowed huge sums to pay for unification, driving up interest rates. Britain, fighting off recession, desperately wanted to keep interest rates low. Money flowed into marks and out of pounds, driving the pound below permissible levels. That inherent instability invited crisis. 
 This turmoil bears directly on the Maastricht treaty that France votes on Sunday. The treaty calls for moving to a common currency as well as unifying foreign and defense policies. Even before this week's financial collapse, the preconditions and timetables seemed unrealistic. Now they are transparently so. Nevertheless, Americans have good reasons to hope French voters endorse the treaty.
The U.S. has a strong stake in European integration; it would dampen historic rivalries, encourage international cooperation and promote global prosperity. The Maastricht approach isn't the only possible path to this goal, or even the best. Yet its defeat in the present pessimistic environment would risk sending Europe in the wrong direction.
What's vital to the U.S. is a prosperous Europe -- productive enough to sell export-quality goods and wealthy enough to buy plenty of U.S. exports. The exact nature of Europe's currency arrangement isn't all that important. Experts hotly dispute whether Europe would be better served by fixed exchange rates, free-floating rates or a single currency as called for in the Maastricht treaty.
The key to Europe's prosperity is completion of the program to eliminate internal barriers to the flow of goods, investment and people, which should happen by the end of year, regardless of the Maastricht treaty or this week's events.
The treaty will, in any case, need to be augmented to correct problems that have become manifest since it was negotiated last year. Lofty ideas about foreign policy coordination fell flat on their face when confronted with the real-world crisis of Yugoslavia. Differing refugee policies have intensified national tensions. And the fragile economies of Eastern Europe, now nearly three years into the difficult process of reform, remain dangerously outside the integration process.
No matter how the French vote comes out, these issues need to be grappled with. In theory, a "no" vote might simply send negotiators back to devise an improved treaty. But with Europe's economic mood turning sour and severe political problems afflicting several governments, the more likely result would be paralysis.
A "yes" vote, if taken as a mandate to keep making needed course corrections, would advance the health, and wealth, of Europe, and America.

When Reality Strikes

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich.

 BODY:
Reality has a way of catching up with illusionist governments. That has just happened in Britain. Americans may look at the British story with foreboding.
Back in the 1960's Britain had a master illusionist in charge: Harold Wilson, Prime Minister in a Labor Government. I was there, and I remember his talk about "the smack of firm government" and "the white-hot technological revolution" that would make the British economy boom. 
 The Wilson illusion was shattered on Nov. 18, 1967, when Britain was forced to devalue the pound. The people who deal with money operate in the real world, and they saw that Britain was slipping economically in comparison with the other countries of Western Europe.
Memories of that time 25 years ago came back to me the other morning when I happened to be listening to a BBC news broadcast. It spoke of pressures on the pound but quoted Government officials as saying there was "zero chance" of a devaluation. Hmm, I thought, that was what they said in 1967. By the end of the day the pound had been cut loose from its moorings in the European Monetary System and effectively devalued.
This time the Prime Minister is a Conservative, John Major. But he is presiding over the wreckage left by another illusionist, Margaret Thatcher.
Lady Thatcher, as she now is, cast a spell as Prime Minister with her ideological certainty and scorn for the faint-hearted. She convinced many observers that she had put new vitality into British business and started an economic revival.
The truth is otherwise: bleak. Britain is in a devastating recession. Unemployment figures have risen 28 months in a row. The poorest Britons have 5 percent less real income than they did a decade ago. Young people fresh out of universities are finding it difficult or impossible to get jobs. To many, the future looks grim.
The United States has recently been through what seemed a boom period, the Reagan years. The gross national product rose sharply, and there was what Republicans called "remarkable job creation."
The boast about job creation was overdone. Total employment in the U.S. grew by a smaller percentage in the 1980's than in the 1970's or 1960's.
And the Reagan boom had a terrible price. It saddled the country -- our children and grandchildren -- with an enormous national debt. It got the budget so far out of balance that no one really knows how to set it right. And what we most needed to increase, savings and business investment, actually fell.
George Bush's Presidency has been dominated by bad economic news. This year more than 500,000 jobs have been lost by American businesses, 167,000 of them in August alone. In 1991 more than two million Americans fell into the ranks of the poor.
Michigan, with its embattled automobile industry, exemplifies a particular phenomenon: the increase in income disparities in recent years. A report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington shows that the poorest fifth of Michigan residents lost 13.7 percent of their real income on average in the decade after 1979; the middle fifth lost 4.5 percent, and the top fifth gained 8.8 percent.
One might expect richer Americans to be content with such trends, but some are not. One of the striking aspects of the 1992 political campaign is the number of business leaders, Republicans, who have come out for Bill Clinton. Governor Clinton appeared in Silicon Valley this week with some of them, including the chiefs of Apple Computer, Oracle Systems and Hewlett-Packard.
I think those businessmen have seen what the future will be for the United States if it stays on its present course. The country will lose the technological leadership it still has. More and more manufacturing work will move abroad, and more Americans will have to settle for low-paid service jobs. As in the case of Britain, there will be a crumbling of opportunity and hope.
How to avoid that future is the real issue in this campaign: the one that should have been argued at Michigan State next week if President Bush had not sabotaged the debate. If we do not start facing reality and correcting our course now, it will be too late.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Drug Papers

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
On my table are two documents that tell more about a critical American problem than the speeches of the Presidential candidates do. And they tell something, too much, about how Americans deal with the problem.
One paper is another of those appeals for contributions to help fight addiction, from an infested neighborhood. Seventy-five percent of local crime is drug- or alcohol-connected. Suicides, arrests, a mother prostituting her children for drug money -- that kind of thing you've heard a hundred times. 
 But maybe this is interesting: The appeal is not from some city ghetto but from the best-known swank town in the United States, East Hampton on Long Island.
Now we all know that the new plague of drug addiction, and the old one of alcoholism, tear at the life of the country -- and that there is no pass-over, no exemption, for any religion, color, any economic class, neighborhood or town, any family.
We know that. But we manage to bury our knowledge until somebody's child is kidnapped by drugs or booze, or somebody we know is mugged by a junkie. Then we react, all right. We thank God it isn't us, and go about our business until it does become us, wherever our East Hampton is. Then other people thank God.
We haven't got the energy or instincts of self-preservation even to demand that our Presidential contenders recognize addiction as a major issue and give us some real idea of how they propose to help the country get off needle, pill and bottle.
The other document tells us something even more revealing about our talents for delusion: When one of our cities is in riot, we hide from the drug connection. Robert Morgenthau, District Attorney of Manhattan, has done a lot for New Yorkers since he took office on Jan. 1, 1975. He has never done anything more important than draw up and make public the 45-page report on the riots in Washington Heights in July.
Briefly: A policeman chased a Dominican immigrant into the lobby of a building, then shot and killed him. The policeman said he shot in self-defense.
Two women said they had seen the officer beat the man, then kill him as he lay unconscious on the floor.
Newspapers and TV said Washington Heights "exploded." More accurately: A small part of the population smashed and looted while most residents locked themselves in their apartments.
Mr. Morgenthau's painstaking report destroys the testimony against the officer. It confirms his story that the man was not only armed and violent, but drew his gun. It says the cop had to fire to stay alive. A grand jury dismissed the case.
The man who died was part of the contemptuously open drug operation that dominates life in Washington Heights, day and night. He used drugs heavily, was a convicted drug peddler, a probation violater, a fugitive.
On a tape, he is seen with another drug criminal who tosses packages of cocaine around. Somebody on the voice track boasts that in "liberated" Washington Heights drugs are legal.
Those journalists who tried discovered the drug connection quickly. We also found out that during the riots lawmen with a record for telling the truth said the drug gangs started and fanned the riots to frighten police away from enforcement.
The police are bitter that Mayor Dinkins concentrated his public sympathy on the family of the dead man, not the cop who had to confront him. Thousands of them turned a demonstration against the Mayor into nasty hooliganism. It disgraced them.
But the fact remains that during the July riots -- and to this day -- New Yorkers bury in them what they know: whole neighborhoods of the city are captive to drug criminals, terrorists who kill almost at will, and can manipulate the city into crisis.
Still: for East Hampton weekenders: The acronym of the appeal is APPLE. Its address is P.O. Box 1270, Wainscott, N.Y.
For others, if you don't know the candidates' addresses, just Washington should do for the President, and Little Rock for the Governor. You will get a form letter back, perhaps.
So why keep writing columns about this country's addictions? Maybe because a doctor named William Cahan helped nag me out of my own, after four decades of heavy smoking. He told me it wasn't too late, and apparently it wasn't.

HEADLINE: U.S. Hasn't Given Up Linking Genes to Crime

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Faced with complaints of veiled racism, the National Institutes of Health," you report (front page, Sept. 5), "withdrew financing of an academic conference on the search for a genetic basis for criminal behavior, forcing its indefinite postponement." However, you overlook the main thrust and context of the criticism of the "Genetic Factors in Crime" conference, which was scheduled for October at the University of Maryland. The conference was the tip of a much larger and more dangerous iceberg, the Federal "violence initiative," which remains largely untouched. 
 The violence initiative was announced by Frederick Goodwin, psychiatrist director of the National Institute of Mental Health, addressing the National Mental Health Advisory Council last Feb. 11. Dr. Goodwin's remarks drew public criticism, as you reported March 8. Dr. Goodwin had compared the "high-impact inner city" to a jungle and its youth to rhesus monkeys who only want to kill one another, have sex and reproduce.
A transcript of Dr. Goodwin's remarks, subsequently obtained by my organization, disclosed something yet more ominous -- his announcement and description of a giant new Federal program to identify potentially violent inner-city children based on biological and genetic "markers." Specifically rejecting psychosocial explanations for inner-city crime, the violence initiative focuses on allegedly biologically "vulnerable" children and youth for psychiatric diagnosis and preventive treatment.
Dr. Goodwin estimates that 100,000 children, as young as 5, will be identified for psychiatric interventions. He called the violence initiative the No. 1 funding priority for the Federal mental health establishment in 1994.
My organization has since obtained documentation that millions of dollars of Federal funds are being spent on violence initiative research and planning, including studies of both rhesus monkeys and inner-city children. Newly developed psychiatric drugs are being tested for violence prevention in monkey studies, and some psychiatrists are claiming they can be used in humans for the same purpose. It seems inevitable that the violence initiative will involve administering the same drugs to inner-city children. The widespread use of Ritalin to control aggressive children, frequently supported or initiated by public schools, has set a precedent for pharmacological intervention.
As I describe in "Beyond Conflict" (New York, 1992), the violence initiative scapegoats black children and excuses society from facing racism, poverty, unemployment and other problems that cause crime and violence in the inner city. Working closely with members of the black community in New York City, Baltimore and Washington, my center developed a coalition against the violence initiative, focusing first on stopping the conference on genetic factors in crime. The success of the coalition in preventing that conference from taking place must not distract from the larger need to stop the violence initiative.

HEADLINE: Inflation Isn't Down

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Bush's repeated statement that inflation is down is especially irritating to those of us who live on retirement incomes. He means to say, of course, that the rate of inflation is down. "Inflation is down" is an oxymoron, a contradiction in terms. Inflation is ever present and continues to erode the purchasing power of the dollar for all of us. 
 One must wonder whether this inaccuracy is intended to deceive or just another instance of sloppy use of words.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN EUROPE;
Taking the Pulse of the Major Economies

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Like a disease that strikes those already weak with other illnesses, the turmoil in the world's currency markets afflicts nations struggling with huge budget deficits, high interest rates, shaky banking systems and lingering recessions. Not one of the world's major industrialized economies now enjoys good health and a bright prognosis. Diplomacy and political leadership often involve recommending tough measures only for the other nations' economic ailments. Here, country by country, are the challenges that economists and business leaders say these nationsl face.
 
BRITAIN
 When Harold Wilson reneged on his pledge to maintain the pound's value 25 years ago, his Government toppled. Now John Major faces a continuing recession, high interest rates and a currency crisis that forced him to go back on his word.
 
GERMANY
 No end in sight to the fallout from the takeover of eastern Germany, the largest leveraged buyout in history. With expenses of $100 billion a year, Germans borrow what they refuse to pay in higher taxes. They and their fellow Europeans pay up anyway in higher interest rates, slower growth and monetary turmoil.
 
FRANCE
 Savvy, competitive industries and continuing growth fail to relieve high unemployment. Still, it's politics, not economics, that dominates the agenda. The nation's role in a unified Europe, and its sufferance of President Mitterrand, turn on a referendum this Sunday.
 
ITALY
 Coalition governments prove incapable of clinging to office or bringing huge budget deficits under control. State-owned industries are no more efficient than the tax collectors. Currency traders, doubting the fight against inflation willever turn serious, continue to profit by betting against the lira.
 
SPAIN
 Marrying into the European Community in 1986 meant marrying for better (at first) or for worse (right now). Foreign investors and builders have backed off, production costs have risen, and jobs are harder to find. Budget and trade deficits show the strain.
 
UNITED STATES
 It's the morning after in America - a joyless, jobless recovery. Government, bowed under its debts, continues to spend. Consumers, ruling their borrowing binge and fearing for their jobs, practice austerity. Both presidential candidates vow to reduce the budget deficit; neither dares offer a credible plan.
 
JAPAN
 The stock market off more than 50 percent, the banks wobbling, real estate in decline - and this the healthiest among the world's major industrial economies. A recession Japanese-style just means slow, 1 to 2 percent growth. With help from a new, $86 billion public spending plan, Japan can recharge by next year.

HEADLINE: North Korea's A-Bomb Plans Seem Less Perilous

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 17

 BODY:
President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea said today that while he remained suspicious of North Korea's nuclear intentions, he had become convinced that its "determination to develop nuclear weapons has become weaker."
Mr. Roh's comments marked a reversal from predictions only five months ago by the Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates, and other United States and Korean officials that North Korea could be only months way from building an atomic weapon. 
 In a wide-ranging interview, President Roh said he would continue to insist that North Korea go beyond the inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency now under way and agree to far more intrusive mutual inspections on both sides.
"We still have suspicions about the North Korean nuclear program," he said, "just as the United States and other allies are not satisfied." But American officials have begun to say that Mr. Gates may have overestimated North Korea's nuclear skills.
 
3 Little Pacts, No Big One
 In talks that ended today in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, the Prime Ministers of the two countries signed three minor agreements but failed again to agree on a program that would allow the South to conduct "challenge inspections" of military sites in the North and the South.
But Mr. Roh said, "My own view is that in the long run, North Korea will have to submit to mutual inspection" because it will be the only way to improve relations with the United States and Japan.
Mr. Roh, who is 60 years old and leaves office in February, talked at length about his trip later this month to China, which recently established diplomatic relations with South Korea.
 
Presidential Goals
 "The main goal of my 'northern policy' was to open formal relations with North Korea's friends and allies, and through them to influence North Korea itself," he said, referring to diplomatic initiatives that have turned Russia and China, once among the South's most hated enemies, into its newest trading partners.
The Chinese no longer "want North Korea to be a threat to this region," he said. While China is believed to have more influence over the North than any other nation, its sudden interest in Seoul is largely economic: Trade between South Korea and the nation that 40 years ago tried to crush it is expected to double this year, to over $10 billion.
Like other Asian leaders in recent months, Mr. Roh, who is to visit the United States next week, appealed for Washington to remain an active player in Asia. Saying he trusted the Administration's commitments to keep forces in the region, he nonetheless expressed concern that budgetary constraints would force the United States to gradually pull back from its post-World War II role of keeping Asia's biggest powers in check.
"Whenever the United States played that role, the region has enjoyed stability," he said. "Whenever the United States withdrew, we saw disputes and wars. This is the clear lesson of history."
President Roh's assessment of North Korea's nuclear intentions came just days after the International Atomic Energy Agency completed its third inspection of the North's atomic sites. While the results have not been made public, agency officials have said recently that they had little doubt that North Korea had been building a plutonium-reprocessing plant, which could make bomb fuel from the waste products of atomic reactors.
But the state of the plant, at a heavily guarded site at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, suggested that the North Koreans were far from mass production of plutonium. The vast building was incomplete. Most of the equipment was described as outmoded, and it is still not clear if North Korea has the technology to turn plutonium into effective weapon fuel.
In the interview, Mr. Roh suggested that North Korea, while initially hoping to build a bomb, had been taken aback by the pressure from the United States, Japan, Russia and other large powers to give up the project. American and Japanese officials have made it clear to North Korea, as recently as this week, that they would not improve relations without much more intensive inspections.
"As for North Korea's will to persist in the development of nuclear weapons," the President said, "it has been somewhat alleviated by pressure."
In Washington, a growing number of experts are coming to similar conclusions.
"They would have loved to continue the nuclear program, but they were suffering a diplomatic cost overrun," said Leonard S. Spector, who heads a committee studying Korean nuclear policy for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "They are caving into pressure. But that doesn't mean they are trying to hide and preserve what they have got."
In talking about the North Korean Government, Mr. Roh spoke with the confidence of an ex-general who appeared, in the last months of his administration, to have finally outflanked his foe.
He said today that the Government of Kim Il Sung, the North's Stalinist leader, "is much more isolated this year than it was last year."
"Their economic situation has deteriorated," he said, "and their people are suffering from the lack of food.
"The system is becoming somewhat unstable," he said of North Korea's rigid and closed society, but he declined to venture a guess about how long it could last. He warned, however, that the North could lash out, comparing it at one point to Iraq before the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Roh has been sometimes criticized for moving too quickly to reach agreements with North Korea -- including last December's agreement on "reconciliation and nonaggression" -- in hopes of meeting directly with Kim Il Sung and being remembered for breaking through the four-decade struggle between the two Koreas.
Mr. Roh said today that while a summit meeting would be "better than tens or hundreds of meetings at a lower level, . . . the situation has changed significantly" since he first sought such meetings.
Tensions on the peninsula, which were at their height five years ago after the bombing of a Korean Airlines jet by North Korean agents, are now much reduced, he said.
 
Democracy Taking Hold
 What he hoped to be remembered for, he added, was not the opening to the North but the restoration of democracy in the South: It was Mr. Roh's declaration on June 29, 1987, that paved the way for free elections after years of military dictatorship, coups, repression and assassination.
While the system is still plagued with scandals and vote buying, recent evidence that local elections early this year were fixed by the ruling party may force out several leading members of Mr. Roh's Cabinet.
"We have not completed our democratization yet," he said. "The process was very difficult, we had many complaints, but we did our best."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ross Perot;
Perot Says He May Rejoin Race To Publicize His Economic Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
Ross Perot today took to his favorite forum, talk television, with a new twist to his on-again, off-again designs on the White House.
The Texas businessman said he might want to run for President, but not because he actually wants to be President. Instead, he said, re-entering the race would make it easier to buy television time from the networks for commercials pushing his prescription for the ailing economy. 
 "Interestingly enough, I'm trapped," Mr. Perot said on the NBC News "Today" program. "They won't sell it to me unless I declare as a candidate. So I may be the first guy in history that had to declare he was a candidate so he could buy TV time."
On July 16, Mr. Perot abruptly dropped out of the race, and nothing he said today contradicted that earlier announcement. But Mr. Perot has continued to tease interviewers and the public about his intentions, and he kept up this familiar routine this morning and this evening on the "MacNeil/ Lehrer Newshour" on PBS and on ABC's "Nightline."
 
Possible Debate Role
 At the same time, Arizona became the 50th state to submit his name for the November ballot, a development that coupled with his continued respectable showing in recent polls could make Mr. Perot more of a factor in the campaign. He could demand, for instance, that he be included in Presidential debates because he appears to meet the threshold of the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates: that a candidate's name be on the ballot in a majority of states and have a substantial standing in the polls.
Mr. Perot said his decision to revive a full-fledged campaign would depend on whether President Bush or Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas presents an economic plan that Mr. Perot deems responsible. But he put the burden on his supporters to "make that decision eventually" about whether he should run.
While it is, as usual, not clear what Mr. Perot will eventually do, neither is it clear what a Perot candidacy would mean for either major party.
Fourteen percent of voters say they would cast their ballot for Mr. Perot if his name appears in their state, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken last week. The poll found that Mr. Perot would draw equally from both parties, with 10 percent of Mr. Bush's supporters saying they would vote for Mr. Perot, and about 12 percent of Mr. Clinton's. The margin of sampling error for the poll was plus or minus three percentage points.
Stephen J. Wayne, a professor of government at Georgetown University, referred to Mr. Perot's well-known dislike for Mr. Bush as he summed up the Texan's options: "Here's a guy with a big ego who wants to show that people still love him. How do you get in and show that people love you without looking foolish and without resulting in the re-election of President Bush?"
Mr. Wayne echoed many academics and strategists who believe an active campaign by Mr. Perot could tip the balance to Mr. Bush or to Mr. Clinton in battleground states like Texas and California.
 
A Question of Betrayal
 But a looming question is whether Mr. Perot left his many original supporters with such a feeling of betrayal that they might not vote in November for him or anyone else.
In a Times/CBS News Poll taken last June after the California primary, Mr. Perot's popularity was at its peak. He was virtually tied with Mr. Bush, with the backing of 30 percent of the voters to Mr. Bush's 33 percent, while Mr. Clinton had 24 percent.
In the current poll, however, Mr. Perot has something he did not have then: negative ratings about twice as high as his positive ones. Twenty-one percent of voters have a favorable view of Mr. Perot but 39 percent have an unfavorable view.
After Mr. Perot dropped out of the race, more than half of his supporters said he had walked away from what he had set out to do without accomplishing very much. A Times/CBS News Poll conducted July 16-17, also found 41 percent of Mr. Perot's supporters bearing some anger toward him, saying they felt deserted, while 50 percent did not feel that way.
Yet there still seem to be many Perot loyalists around the country. "In July, we lost half of our volunteers," Catherine Boley, a volunteer in the Phoenix office of Mr. Perot's political organization, United We Stand, America, said today in a telephone interview. "But we started the petition drive just 10 days ago and we've just been amazed at how many people are crawling out of the woodwork everywhere. We can't even believe it ourselves."
Mr. Perot said his lawyers were figuring out whether he had to formally declare his candidacy to buy television time. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said buying television time is a legitimate issue.
She said, for instance, that the networks might be reluctant to allow Mr. Perot to buy a five-minute block because it could "wreak havoc with their scheduling." But if Mr. Perot were an actual candidate, the networks would be required to sell him the time because the Bush campaign bought a five-minute block last week.
"It's a funny world out there," Mr. Perot said on the "Today" show, "that you're forced to become a candidate so that you can explain to the American people what these problems are."
Calling on Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush to come forward with more specific economic plans, Mr. Perot said, "at this point, neither plan will do the job."
But Mr. Perot's call for painful economic choices represents something of a conversion for him. When he appeared to be in the race, he offered what he described as painless proposals. Not until he dropped out did Mr. Perot put out his austere plan to raise taxes and trim the Federal deficit.
He boasted today that people were so interested in his book that outlines "a non-politician's platform" that it has risen to No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list for non-fiction paperbacks.

HEADLINE: BONN URGED TO ACT BY U.S. AND BRITAIN

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
With the finance ministers of the leading industrial nations scheduled to meet here Saturday, American and British officials teamed up today to put pressure on Germany's central bank to cut its interest rates. Lower German rates would encourage world economic growth and help to stem the currency crisis in Europe.
Though the Bush Administration was actively urging Germany to ease its tight money policy last year, it has been relatively quiet recently, even as Europe's system of economic coordination seemed in near collapse this week. But a senior Administration official said the White House now saw in the European chaos an opportunity to "demonstrate leadership" on a high-profile economic issue and "be a force for stability." 
 Indeed, in some ways, President Bush could turn the crisis to his advantage, because there is not a lot at stake economically for the United States in the short run.
 
U.S. Indicates Impatience
 David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury, in an interview today on the Cable News Network, indicated impatience with the Bundesbank, which has kept Germany's short-term interest rates above 9 percent to fight inflation.
"I think there will be pressure on Germany on the interest rate question," Mr. Mulford said. "It is hard to imagine putting the system back together again in Europe without Germany taking some sort of action."
Officials from the so-called Group of Seven, the leading industrial nations of the world, said the most urgent topic at their meeting would be figuring out how to help bring a semblance of order back to Europe's chaotic markets. Several officials said the key to this was a scaling back of interest rates by the German central bank.
During a day of frequent telephone calls between the Group of Seven ministers and central bankers, the officials indicated that the United States and Britain would play the heavies in putting pressure on the Bundesbank, while France and Italy would support the effort, but more politely. The other members of the Group of Seven are Canada, Germany and Japan.
During a series of angry exchanges with German officials, Prime Minister John Major of Britain slammed the Bundesbank, saying his nation wanted to "make sure that monetary policy is run in the interests of all the countries of Europe and not geared toward national interests in any individual country."
In the television interview, Mr. Mulford said the seven nations' finance ministers were working on contingency plans to stabilize European markets if they erupt into turmoil on Monday. Officials said those plans could include devaluations and heavy central bank intervention to defend whatever currencies come under attack. Throughout the turmoil of the last week, American officials gave no indication that the Federal Reserve was intervening in currency markets to help stabilize the dollar or European currencies.
Many currency traders predict that the French franc could be hit hard if the French vote on Sunday to reject plans for further steps of European unification, including the establishment of a European central bank and a single currency. Britain, Italy and Spain were forced to devalue their currencies earlier this week when they came under attack.
Speaking privately, several American and European officials said they were very dissatisfied that the Bundesbank cut its main interest rate by just one-quarter of 1 percent last weekend.
"Everyone feels that way," one Treasury official said.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who is serving as chairman of Saturday's meeting of the seven nations, has spoken repeatedly over the week with European finance ministers. One aide said he had spoken at least once a day with Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, and that Mr. Brady had twice briefed President Bush at length about Europe's currency crisis.
In diplomatic language clearly directed at Germany, Treasury Secretary Brady said in a speech today in Washington: "Lower interest rates in Europe are inevitable if that Continent is to return to growth. It is important that a return to growth be accomplished as soon as possible."
Mr. Lamont said today that his nation would not put its currency back into the European Monetary System, an arrangement of linked exchange rates, until Germany and the Bundesbank budged. Mr. Major's Government has prolonged Britain's recession and weathered considerable protest for linking the country's interest rates to Germany's with the aim of squeezing out British inflation.
"We want to be satisfied that German policy, which has produced many of the tensions within the Exchange Rate Mechanism, is actually going to have some changes and be able to operate within a more stable environment," he said.
Last spring, Mr. Mulford touched off an angry clash with German Finance Ministry officials by urging Bonn to cut its sizable budget deficit, which has swelled as a result of financing German unification. That, he said, would give the Bundesbank more latitude to cut rates because the German central bank has kept rates high mainly to offset the inflationary pressures created by the budget deficit.
If they are going to promise further deficit cuts, German officials might demand a quid pro quo from the United States or other members of the Group of Seven.

HEADLINE: Foundation Is Giving $10 Million To Help South Florida to Rebuild

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The Knight Foundation announced today that it was giving $10 million in grants to help rebuild Dade County in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.
The money was committed by trustees this week after a tour of areas in the southern part of the county that were most devastated by the hurricane. Of the $10 million, $3.6 million has already been granted, including $1 million to the American Red Cross for disaster relief. 
 "Our first grant was directed toward relief, but now rebuilding will be the foundation's focus," said Lee Hills, chairman of the charitable group.
 
Other Donations Cited
 The Knight Foundation, created in 1950 by John S. and James L. Knight, two founders of the Miami-based Knight-Ridder Inc., the newspaper and broadcasting chain, is one of the nation's largest private foundations. A spokeswoman said it has assets of more than $620 million.
In addition to its hurricane aid, the foundation plans to give more than $27 million nationally to social service, cultural, education and other organizations.
Besides the hurricane-aid grant to the Red Cross, the foundation has given $2.5 million to We Will Rebuild, an organization of community, political and business leaders charged with raising money for the recovery, $100,760 to United Way of Dade County for a state relief hot line, $25,000 to the University of Florida's Center for Affordable Housing and $15,000 to Planned Parenthood for an emergency clinic.
The rest of the $10 million, to be disbursed over the next two years, will be divided among organizations who apply and qualify for the grants.
In a related matter today, state officials said that a $10 million state fund meant for small businesses damaged by Hurricane Andrew had been exhausted and that more money was needed.
The money was taken from state emergency funds to offer six-month, interest-free loans of $5,000 to $25,000 to help with things like relocating or replacing damaged merchandise.
Gov. Lawton Chiles offered the $10 million two weeks ago, and more than 300 applications had been approved. But applications were cut off today after more than $8 million had been distributed because requests on file were expected to eat up the rest, state officials said.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Prosecutor Bows Out of the Spotlight

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 18

 BODY:
Los Angeles County's District Attorney, Ira Reiner, who failed to win convictions in the beating of Rodney G. King and other high-profile cases and who faced long odds in his bid for a third term, pulled out of the race today, saying he did not have the stomach for a negative campaign.
Mr. Reiner, a 56-year-old Democrat, said he had called today to congratulate his opponent, Gilbert L. Garcetti, a former top aide who is now a bitter personal rival and who defeated him in a nonpartisan primary last June by 34 percent to 26 percent. 
 After that setback, Mr. Reiner said in an interview, it was clear that the only chance he had to win in the general election was to wage a particularly negative campaign. "I just didn't have the stomach for it," said Mr. Reiner, who has gained a reputation as a highly political District Attorney with an eye for the limelight. "It's just too distasteful; distasteful for me and for my family, disruptive for the office and divisive for the community."
 
Major Setback in 1990 Race
 A fast-rising political star who went from City Controller to city attorney to District Attorney in less than a decade, Mr. Reiner suffered a humiliating defeat in 1990 Democratic primary for State Attorney General.
Though he won convictions in a number of important cases, his name became associated with several high-profile losses, including the McMartin Pre-School child molestation trials and the trial of John Landis, the director of the film "Twilight Zone," in which three actors were killed by a helicopter.
Most stunning was the failure of his office to win convictions in the trial of four Los Angeles police officers who were captured on videotape beating and kicking Mr. King, a failure that touched off widespread rioting.
Mr. Reiner's announcement came amid speculation that Mayor Tom Bradley would soon announce that he would not seek re-election next year.
 
'I May Come Back'
 Mr. Reiner declined to say whether he was interested in joining the mayoral race, saying he had not given thought to his long-term future. "I may come back into public life again," he said. "I have no idea."
A spokesman for the 74-year-old Mayor said he would disclose late next week whether he would seek a sixth term. Some of the Mayor's staff members have already taken other jobs and the local press has reported that Mr. Bradley has received offers from top law firms.
His departure, along with those of Mr. Reiner and former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who resigned under pressure in June, would reshape the political landscape at a time when the city and county are struggling to deal with the social and economic problems raised by the riots and recession.
Mr. Garcetti said today that polls had consistently shown him leading in the general election -- a race between the two top finishers in the primary -- and that Mr. Reiner "must have seen the handwriting on the wall."
In the past, Mr. Garcetti, a longtime prosecutor whom Mr. Reiner demoted from his post as chief deputy, has told reporters that he is prepared to disclose the contents of "173 spiral notebooks" documenting his years in that office. Mr. Reiner has said that Mr. Garcetti "is not to be trusted in a position of power" and hinted that he would make public previously undisclosed reasons for his demotion.
Noting that candidates around the country were making political calculations like his and proceeding with negative campaigns, Mr. Reiner said today: "I've been in politics some time now and I know it's a tough business. But it doesn't have to be creepy."
Although he asserted today that he had never made a decision based on politics, Mr. Reiner is viewed by many local politicians as a man who will go to extremes to win public acclaim.
 
 
Shooting of Grocer
 After an outcry over the leniency of a judge in sentencing a Korean grocer who was convicted of shooting a young black customer, Mr. Reiner ordered his prosecutors to refuse to argue cases before the judge.
In a current case against three black men accused of beating a white truck driver, Reginald O. Denny, at the start of the riots, prosecutors refused to accept a black judge to hear the case. In the face of criticism, Mr. Reiner offered several explanations, then tried to get a different black judge to hear the case to quiet his critics.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail;
In Little Rock, a Group Plans for a Transition in Washington

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

 BODY:
Down in Little Rock, Ark., it's called long-range planning. But that's just a political euphemism.
The fact is, in recent weeks the Clinton campaign has begun laying plans for a takeover from the Bush Administration next January -- the transition. And in coming weeks the pace of that planning will quicken. 
 Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman, has been directing the half dozen or so people who have been working on the transition plans. In fact, he's spending most of his time on them when he's not trying to negotiate where, when and if there will be any Bush-Clinton debates.
He's not providing any details. But as early as next week he'll announce that the transition staff will expand to 16 people.
Presumptuous?
Most Presidential candidates engage in transition planning to some degree, even those trailing badly in the polls, which Mr. Clinton is not. Normally the planning looks ahead to things like White House staff positions, liaison with Congress and possible Cabinet appointees.
"You have to engage in transition planning now," Mr. Kantor said. "It would be irresponsible not to. On the other hand, it would be foolhardy to let it distract from the issue at hand, and that's Nov. 3."
 
Reaganomics Man Isn't Behind Bush
 When it comes to the economy, nothing seems to being going right for President Bush much of the time. Now he's behind the curve with Arthur Laffer.
Mr. Laffer is the economist who first propounded the "Laffer curve" theory of cutting the national deficit by cutting taxes. He is also considered one of the founders of "Reaganomics," which incorporated the curve theory.
Mr. Bush once asserted that "Reaganomics" was "voodoo economics." But that was before Ronald Reagan invited him to be Vice President and Mr. Bush had a change of economic mind.
For Mr. Laffer, it hasn't been change enough. He was a Bush supporter for awhile, but now he considers Mr. Bush's economic performance to be a disaster, mainly because the President broke his pledge of "no new taxes" and let Federal spending increase.
"I really think Bush does not deserve to be re-elected," he is telling audiences these days.
Message: Arthur Laffer is going to vote for Bill Clinton.
 
Gay Declaration By Schlafly's Son
 John Schlafly, the son of Phyllis Schlafly, the prominent Republican and family-values proponent, has announced that he is homosexual.
Mr. Schlafly, a 41-year-old lawyer who lives with his parents in Alton, Ill., discussed his politics and sexuality in an interview published yesterday in The San Francisco Examiner. He said he "warmly endorsed" his mother's political views but said he disagreed with Vice President Dan Quayle's recent assertion that homosexuality is a matter of choice.
Mrs. Schlafly told The Examiner that she has never advocated discrimination against homosexuals. She said her work was devoted to opposing abortion and the equal rights amendment.
"Adult children don't always do what their parents wish," she said. "He is my son, and I do love my children."
Mr. Schlafly said he saw a need for some recognition of same-sex couples, but added he was not sure legal marriage should be an option. Mrs. Schlafly said she opposes same-sex marriages, but added, "I wouldn't call that gay-bashing."

PRESIDENT BUSH
In a speech yesterday to A.T. & T. employees and women service organizations at A.T. & T. corporate headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J.
"Let me talk just about another job-related issue, something that's called the glass ceiling. Today companies are promoting some women in greater numbers, but not fast enough, and so a lot of talented women are going into the businesses for themselves. And this isn't just a corporate problem. We're seeing the same thing happen in government. And I am proud of our record in promoting women, but I'm especially proud that these talented women -- that we've put talented women in important economic positions, running the Department of Labor, running the Department of Commerce or the Small Business Administration, or handling all of our trade negotiations. 
 The women I work with tell me they don't want any special opportunity. They just want the right to succeed or fail, to be measured by the same standard as men.
And we want to see the Lynn Martins of corporate America succeed, too. And that's why this Secretary of Labor, Lynn Martin, has made shattering the glass ceiling a top priority. She's making sure that companies who receive your tax dollars through Federal contracts make career opportunities available to women."
 
GOV. BILL CLINTON
In a speech yesterday at a campaign rally at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque
"I believe we should have a system, like everybody else that we're competing with, to guarantee training and retraining to adults throughout their working lives. Today the Germans are spending five times as much as we are educating their adult work force, and that's why they make 20 percent more than our folks do for working a shorter work week. I believe we can do better if we'll take our heads out of the sand and face the future.
Finally, I want to open the doors of college education to all Americans, to every American. But to do that, I have to challenge you to help. I want to replace the student loan program, which is costly and inefficient, with a new program, a national trust fund, out of which any American, without regard to income, can borrow the money to go to college and pay it back in one of two ways -- either as a small percentage of your income after you go to work, at tax time, so no one can beat the bill, or, even better, by giving two years of your life to your country here at home.
To rebuild America. Think of it. Just think of it. Think of New Mexico. What if every young person borrowed the money, all of it, for four years, to go to college, and then paid it back with two years of work at reduced pay as a teacher, a police officer, working to help children, working to help the elderly, working to support the independence of people with disabilities, working in housing programs. We could revolutionize this country and educate a whole generation of Americans. It would be the best money we ever spent."
 
SENATOR AL GORE
 In testimony yesterday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington
"President Bush, unfortunately, is locked in the past. I mean, here is a man who sees 20-year-old technology at the supermarket checkout line and looks like an ape discovering fire. No wonder when the Japanese and Europeans come up with the ideas of marketing these new technologies that clean up the environment and create jobs, he just can't imagine that this is going to benefit our country. But it will. And what will hurt our economy is continued adherence to more of the same."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Watch;
In Bid for Attention, Weather Wins

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
It was George and Bill versus Andrew and Iniki. The real windstorms won.
The Presidential candidates have been having a hard time competing against a couple of hurricanes for news time in recent days. Indeed, only Bill Clinton's draft record and George Bush's refusal to attend the first scheduled Presidential debate have prevented the contest from turning into a total rout. 
 As the campaign plays out on television radio, it has been difficult to escape the sense over the last several days that the President and his Democratic challenger are running out of tricks for getting attention. Even Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing radio host who introduced Hillary-bashing as a Republican sport, seems vaguely bored by the whole spectacle.
Over the last few days, Mr. Limbaugh has reserved most of his venom not for his favorite, Mrs. Clinton, but for Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York City Comptroller. By placing fourth in New York's Senate primary, Ms. Holtzman provided the radio host with all the evidence he needed to declare the year of the woman a feminist hoax.
 
Still Pulling Air Time
 To be sure, the Presidential candidates have never been allowed to slip far from the top of the news, even when the weather upstaged them daily.
And last week, when attention to Hurricane Andrew finally began to recede, President Bush had a few good days, dominating the newscasts by handing out Federal largess and making what was called a major economic address. But then Hurricane Iniki, like rain at a picnic, brought the fun to an end.
By the time most tourists were evacuated from the island of Kauai and the images of palms trees doubled over in the wind started to grow dull, the President once again lost control of the story line. The networks produced new polls showing that Mr. Bush, for all his generosity with Federal money, was still trailing Mr. Clinton by a significant margin.
On Wednesday, CBS returned to Florida to illustrate the President's plight; despite Mr. Bush's pledge of billions of dollars in hurricane relief to the state, polls showed him barely holding onto his lead there. "This is a catastrophe here," a grizzled old man told CBS. "And the Government don't really care."
 
Solace in the Weather
 For Mr. Clinton, there has been a bright side to the tropical disturbances: the more real storms, the fewer "storm of controversy" reports.
On Tuesday, for example, when Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton's speeches to the National Guard Association led the news, the coverage was none too favorable to the Arkansas Governor. For NBC, the speeches provided the opportunity to list the inconsistencies in Mr. Clinton's account of his draft record, one by one. ABC used the occasion to devote a "Nightline" program to Mr. Clinton's history with the draft, starting with a film clip from 1978 showing one Lieut. Col. Billy Geren voicing concern about the Governor's lack of military service.
"Among campaign issues, it could be his Achilles' heel," Ted Koppel said, beginning one of the season's mixed podiatry metaphors. "But is Bill Clinton shooting himself in the foot?"
As he did in the New York primary campaign, Mr. Clinton turned to Don Imus, the New York radio personality, for solace when the television reporting took an unflattering turn. On Monday, the Governor appeared on Mr. Imus's morning program on WFAN-AM and expressed regret that he had mishandled questions about his draft record. The appearance seems to have paid off; on Tuesday, Mr. Imus, who typically refers to Mr. Clinton as a "redneck bozo," said that he would vote for the Governor in November.
Looking for new views of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush as their traveling show grows stale, some networks have taken a novel approach to the campaign: reporting on it from places where the candidates themselves have never been sighted.
On Tuesday night, for example, ABC's Peter Jennings reported the evening news standing in a suburban subdivision in Charlotte, N.C. "It certainly doesn't look like a battleground," Mr. Jennings said, gesturing to a cluster of white colonial homes. (No, one had to agree, it looked like a subdivision.)
On the same night, in a report ambitiously called "Reality Check," Mark Phillips led the CBS Evening News broadcast with a visit to a Pittsburgh bowling alley. In one of the weirder efforts to demonstrate what is actually going on in this campaign, Mr. Phillips asked viewers to think of the bowling balls as the candidates' positions on the issues and the bowling pins as the voters.
"What happens when one meets the other?" he asked, as a ball skidded down the alley. "These days it seems something like total confusion." And indeed it did.

HEADLINE: Adding an Extra Pair of Eyes on School Buses, to Help Insure Safety

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn., Sept. 16

 BODY:
In one of her first mornings as a school bus monitor, Peggy Brady retrieved a lost backpack, tended to a bloody nose and comforted a little girl who wasn't yet sold on this kindergarten business.
But her real purpose was saving lives. 
 As the bus threaded its way along the back roads of Westport, Mrs. Brady hopped off at 30 stops to help children cross the street and scramble aboard. Before the driver moved, Mrs. Brady checked in front of the bus, in back and under the wheels.
Mrs. Brady is part of a trend in Connecticut and throughout the nation as parents and school officials seek ways to make school buses safer. Similar bus-monitor programs are operating in Buffalo, Rochester, and North Haven, Conn. In Rhode Island, monitors are mandated by state law.
"When people talk about school bus-safety issues," Mrs. Brady said, "it's usually over seat belts, but there are rarely fatalities inside a school bus because they are so well made. Where the danger lies is just outside the bus where small children can be difficult to see."
 
A Fatal Accident
 In Westport, the bus monitors were the town's response to an accident in December in which an 8-year-old girl, Holly Finley, was killed. A drawstring on her jacket became caught in a railing as she got off the bus at her driveway. When the bus drove away, she was pulled beneath it.
"It was a horrible tragedy that caused great sorrow and great concern," said Joyce Losen, assistant to School Superintendent Paul Kelleher, "and after that, the superintendent appointed a systemwide school bus safety committee who felt it was necessary to institute a bus-monitoring program for all elementary school students."
The program costs $80,000 a year out of a school budget of $33 million. Most parents think it is well worth it.
"I don't know of anything more valuable than your kids and it's a very cheap program to insure their safety," said Mary Lou Zinser, the mother of an elementary school student. "My child was on the bus where the accident happened that put this all in motion and I feel much better knowing there is an adult monitor on the bus."
After Holly Finley's death, parents learned how common such accidents are. Nationally, about 36 children a year are killed when they are struck by school buses or by passing cars as they board or leave buses, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
In Connecticut, 20 children have been killed in school bus accidents since 1972, said Ronald Harris, a staff lawyer for the State Department of Education.
[Friday morning, in Bristol, Conn., a school bus struck and killed a 3-year-old boy as it pulled away from a curb after dropping off passengers, the Bristol police said. The boy, Brandon Courchesne, who lived on the block where the accident occurred, had not been among the passengers on the bus, said a police spokesman, Officer Thomas Calvello. The officer said he did not know if a monitor had been on the bus.]
Earlier this year, a State School Bus Transportation Study Committee released a report saying that monitors would be helpful on all elementary school buses but that "it was not economically feasible at this time to make it a mandate," Mr. Harris said. Doing so could cost the state $20 million a year, he said.
Still, Mr. Harris said the state would reimburse part of what school districts pay for bus monitors. At the moment only Westport and North Haven have year-round programs. Glastonbury has one for the beginning of the school year and phases it out as young children become familiar with bus travel, he said.
Bob Perry of West Hartford, the president of the Connecticut chapter of Families Insisting on Safe Student Transportation, said his group would continue to fight for a state mandate for elementary-school bus monitors.
Mr. Perry got involved in the issue after his 6-year-old nephew was killed when he was hit by his school bus in Glastonbury two years ago.
"School districts worry more about sports, music and art than they do about the fact that they are putting young children in a really dangerous situation getting off and on school buses," he said. "We've talked with pediatric associations and other experts who say that children ages 5 to 8 are not mentally or physically capable of handling a school bus situation. They need an adult to help them."
 
Bill Was Defeated
 Last year, a bill requiring monitors passed in the Transportation Committee but was narrowly defeated in the Appropriations Committee.
Senator Kevin Sullivan, a West Hartford Democrat and chairman of the Education Committee, said he planned to support such legislation again but would like to see more districts try pilot programs.
In West Hartford, three schools are in a pilot program, and the state Parent-Teacher Association recently agreed to extend liability coverage to all volunteers who work as monitors.
Like many school districts, New York City uses monitors only on buses for special education students.
New Jersey, which this year adopted the nation's first law requiring seat belts on school buses, does not have bus-monitoring programs, said Linda Wells, director of the Bureau of Pupil Transportation. While there have been several fatalities in the last 20 years, she said, "we have nowhere near the Connecticut figure."
In Westport, the monitors are paid $85 a week. They are run through a police check and must pass tests for drugs and tuberculosis.
 
'Hard Position to Fill'
 Finding the monitors has been no easy task, said Ms. Losen, the superintendent's aide. "It's a hard position to fill because for many people it cuts into the workday hours," she said.
Mrs. Brady has been involved from the outset as a parent and because one of her children was a good friend of Holly Finley. Shortly after the accident, Mrs. Brady began researching school bus safety. She has spent hours recruiting and training bus monitors.
Mrs. Brady said a monitor's presence on a bus encouraged orderly behavior, which helps the driver. As she was helping students off the bus on Wednesday at Kings Highway Elementary School, she made sure the younger children were not mistreated by the older students and stopped one boy from pulling a girl's hair as she made her way off the bus.
"A lot can happen when a driver has his back to 55 children," she said. "We all wish our kids were angels, but if they cause a problem and the bus driver is distracted, that's when the worst can happen."
Edward Gomeau, the director of fiscal management for the North Haven schools, said North Haven had had bus monitors since 1976, following two fatalities in the early 70's.
"We have had no fatalities since," said Mr. Gomeau, who has testified in favor of the program in Westport and other towns. North Haven spends about $81,000 a year on monitors out of a budget of $24 million.
"It's an absolutely essential part of our school budget every year," Mr. Gomeau said.

HEADLINE: Some Unexpected Suspects in Currency Turmoil

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Currency traders who have been placing high-risk bets have had a lot to do with the crisis that is rolling through Europe. The word speculator, an accusation in itself, has rolled easily off the lips of finance ministers, like Norman Lamont of Britain, who are looking for scapegoats.
But there is growing evidence that it is the much more conservative institutional investors -- the mutual funds, corporations and pension funds -- that have humbled the British pound, the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta and helped to threaten the future of the European Monetary System and economic unity. 
 These institutions have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in Britain, Italy and Spain, where interest rates are high, on the assumption that the European Monetary System was providing them inexpensive protection against adverse currency fluctuations. The underlying weakness of these currencies, which normally would threaten to wipe out gains from the investments, could be ignored.
But as the European Monetary System crumbled this week the safety of those investments and corporate strategies has been undermined. And the sudden rush of many institutions to protect their investments by buying strong German marks and selling the weaker currencies in Europe -- the pound, the lira, and the peseta -- may well have provided the weight needed to break the system's back.
"If you add up the funds, it is billions and billions of dollars that trickled in slowly, but they all wanted to get out at once," said Richard Jaycobs, the managing director of Finex, a financial exchange in New York that offers instruments for protecting against currency fluctuations.
Other financial executives offer similar views.
"I think the market is driven by the big investors: the mutual funds, the pension funds, the endowments," said David W. Rossmiller, vice president of international fixed-income management at the Travelers Investment Management Company in Hartford. He said he had contributed to the currency turmoil himself by shifting his strategy earlier this month in a way that forced the selling of the weaker European currencies.
"It is portfolios like these that are really driving the market, and it is the speculators that come in and chase the trend," he added.
 
Safety Was Attractive
 In fact, it appears that it was the very credibility of the European Monetary System, which attracted so much investment money, that helped bring the system down so quickly, market participants said. The system provided a safety net that allowed money managers to take risks that they would not ordinarily consider.
It was taking such risks that allowed mutual funds investing in high-yield short-term investments around the world to pay attractive returns. Such funds were run by big firms like Merrill Lynch in the United States and Lombard Odier in Europe. Corporate treasurers also used the security of the monetary system to reduce their costs. And funds protecting themselves against money-losing currency swings -- a practice known as hedging -- also depended on the European Monetary System.
"They would never have dreamed of taking these risks," Matthew Daniel, manager of financial markets at Union Carbide, said. "Why did they? They had the safety net of the European Monetary System under them. Now that has been blown out of the water."
Indeed, the breakdown has changed all these equations. "It was the strength of the system that had sucked in so much money," said David Smart of Fiduciary Trust in London. "And now it had brought about the potential demise of the system."
At the heart of this currency crisis is a practice in the arcane world of currency risk management called proxy hedging.
For example, a rise in the dollar cuts the gain from foreign bonds when the foreign currency earnings are translated back into dollars. To protect those gains, an investor who put $50 million in British bonds might try to offset the risk of a falling pound by selling an equivalent amount of pounds for dollars when the investment was made.
But because of the stability of the European Monetary System, a trader did not have to hedge in the same currency as the investment, but could use a stronger currency, like the mark; that is the practice of proxy hedging. The attraction was that short-term interest rates in Germany were lower than in Italy or Britain, which made the cost of hedging in marks cheaper than in pounds. Theoretically there was little risk because the monetary system made the mark and other currencies move within set trading ranges of each other, and that limited the potential losses.
Arthur Zeikel, the president of Merrill Lynch Asset Management, said this opportunity made the global income funds possible. In discussing the rupture of the system this week -- and the losses for his fund and others -- he sounded like a man whose faith had been betrayed. Without the insurance of the monetary system, his costs of operating will rise sharply.
"By doing cross-hedging and capturing the disparity in interest rates, you create a fund with less volatility and higher return," he said, adding, "In my lexicon, risk and volatility are synonymous."
Corporate treasurers and other fund managers who had also used such techniques were forced to unwind their positions last week, adding to the downward pressure on Europe's weak currencies.
Mr. Rossmiller of Travelers and Thomas J. Berger, a director of Lombard Odier International Portfolio Management Ltd. in London, both made such shifts recently. Mr. Berger, who manages the $1 billion Blanchard Short-Term Global Income Fund, got out of his proxy hedges in early September, as the pressure began to build.
"The speculators may be driving the train but we had to get on to be prudent," he said.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
Senate Fight Set On Top Brackets

BYLINE: By John H. Cushman Jr.

 BODY:
AFTER a hiatus for the Republican Convention and Labor Day recess, the Senate next week will revive its debate on a tax bill.
The tax bill would provide enterprise zone incentives for businesses to locate in economically depressed neighborhoods, and has been considered one of Congress's most urgent priorities since the riots in Los Angeles. It would also contain many provisions that are not particularly controversial, like extension of several expiring tax breaks. 
 The Senate version also contains some of President Bush's recommendations for stimulating the economy, such as a tax break for first-time home buyers. But as drafted by the Senate Finance Committee, the bill includes taxes on wealthier individuals which President Bush adamantly opposes, and with the election so close, the debate on these taxes is likely to be hot and partisan.
Senate leaders want to complete the work quickly, and are trying to persuade senators not to offer most of the 90 or so amendments that have been suggested. Once a Senate bill is passed, lawmakers would fashion a compromise with the version already passed by the House, and send the bill to President Bush before adjourning and hitting the campaign trail in ernest.
But with taxes high on the list of Presidential election issues, the bill's fate is uncertain, even though both Congress and the Administration have reasons for wanting a bill enacted.
"If we don't get a bill, I think then it's a pox on both institutions, the Administration and the Congress," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Finance Committee chairman. "I don't think anybody profits by that."
Two years ago, as part of the budget pact between Congress and the Bush Administration that the President has since repudiated, limits were placed on itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers, whose personal exemptions were also phased out. The effect was to increase tax rates for the uppermost tax brackets from 31 percent, to 33 percent.
These tax increases were supposed to be temporary, one expiring at the end of 1995 and the other a year later. The Finance Committee voted in July to make them permanent, which would raise an additional $7.7 billion in 1996 and 1997.
Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, will offer an amendment to reverse the Finance Committee's action. But Senator Bentsen said that would represent "a tax cut for those making over $100,000 a year." And what of Senator Dole's assertion that the White House simply won't sign a bill that contains the upper-income taxes?
"I'm not going to get into that," Senator Bentsen said. "I turn my cards over one at a time."
 
Pension Plan Fee
 The Internal Revenue Service, which for the last few years has been seeking to encourage more voluntary compliance with the tax rules, is about to make it easier for businesses, especially smaller ones, to make sure that their pension plans conform to the law.
In the past, according to John E. Burke, assistant I.R.S. commissioner, pension plan managers were effectively left playing "audit roulette," meaning that they had to correct technical violations of pension tax rules only if they were audited. In serious cases, pension plans could be disqualified from the usual tax benefits.
A year ago, the agency set up a new program for pension plans that knew they were not in compliance but wanted to correct the defects in the plans, pay a negotiated tax settlement, and remain in the agency's good graces.
Although the agency has worked out about 200 agreements covering more than 10,000 pension plan participants, some companies have been reluctant to come forward even though they know of defects in their plans, because the tax sanctions could be quite large.
Now Mr. Burke has announced an I.R.S. experiment that will let pension plans voluntarily disclose minor defects in their plans, pay a fixed compliance fee, and agree to correct the problems. The compliance fee is expected to be just $1,250 for a plan with fewer than 1,000 participants, and just $500 for plans with less than $500,000 in assets. Larger plans would pay more.
 
Busy Signal Blues
 Taxpayers who called the I.R.S. telephone assistance hot lines during the 1992 spring filing season were more likely than ever to get accurate advice -- assuming somebody picked up the phone. According to I.R.S. test results provided to the General Accounting Office, employees answered 88 percent of the tax law questions correctly, up from 84 percent last year and better than the agency's 85 percent goal. But about two calls out of three to the toll-free lines were never answered at all, as callers either got a busy signal or got tired of waiting for an answer and hung up.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Women Need Free Markets, Not Government, Bush Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: BASKING RIDGE, N.J., Sept. 18

 BODY:
Facing a significant gap in support between men and women in the latest opinion poll, President Bush took his top female aides in tow, lined his speaker's dais end-to-end with women and cast himself today as a feminist, free-market style.
Speaking to several hundred employees at A.T. & T. corporate headquarters in central New Jersey, Mr. Bush argued that his economic programs offer women and families more equality and opportunity than the "Government mandates" that he said were favored by his opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton. 
 "The first order of business," he conceded early, "is to admit that there is still unfinished business" on the agenda of women's concerns.
"Women work as hard as men and still earn less, and that's not acceptable," he said. "And most working women do more than equal work on the job and at home, and that's not acceptable either. And many women are trying to do it all alone."
 
Bush Discounts Argument
 But Mr. Bush maintained that laws that mandate sexual equality or confer social benefits, like family leave in emergencies, were in fact counterproductive because they cost businesses money, forced layoffs and slowed the economy. Better, he said, to help the economy create more jobs and to give women more opportunities to advance in those jobs.
If such an indirect argument seemed unlikely to appeal to women who feel shortchanged by the marketplace, one Presidential aide brought along to brief reporters, Constance Horner, put it more succinctly. "It doesn't do a pregnant woman any good to take leave from her job if some other member of the family doesn't have a job because of it," she said.
Ms. Horner, director of the White House Office of Personnel Management, said nevertheless that such a situation would never occur in her office. Using discretion granted her by White House personnel rules, she said, she has recently allowed two aides to extend their pregnancy leaves from the normal maximum of 10 paid weeks to three months or more, with the extensions unpaid.
Ms. Horner said she was not sure at the time what the Federal policy was on maternity and other family-related leaves of absence. "I just did it," she said.
The President's message was warmly applauded by the A.T. & T. employees in this overwhelmingly Republican, upper-income region, but it was not clear how well it would be received in the working-class regions where the Bush campaign most needs women's votes.
Mr. Bush is struggling to raise his political stock with women, a task both Congress and his own campaign have made none too easy.
A poll of 1,504 registered voters published today by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News indicated that male voters are evenly split between Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton, with each getting 46 percent of the support. But among women, Mr. Bush trailed by 18 points, 54 percent to 36 percent. And among working women, the gap was cavernous: 58 percent to 34 percent. The poll was conducted between last Saturday and Tuesday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The Bush campaign's spokeswoman, Torie Clarke, said today that the reasons for Mr. Bush's sagging popularity with women were not easy to pinpoint. But some seem clear: even Republicans concede, for example, that Mr. Bush suffered with women after a series of strident messages on family values conveyed at last month's Republican National Convention, often on prime-time television.
The Republican platform and some televised speakers, like Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, and the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, were implicitly critical of working women and women's rights. The party platform is hostile toward the sizable majority of women of both parties who support at least some form of legalized abortion.
Ms. Clarke said campaign strategists "are not happy with the perception" created by the convention that the President is unsympathetic to women's issues. She asserted that the perception was baldly inaccurate.
"What's important -- what's the real issue -- is to look at President Bush," she said. "he's the one people will be voting for."

HEADLINE: French Pitch for a Yes on the Treaty

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
For years, Elf Aquitaine, the oil producer that is France's largest company, has confidently built service stations across Europe, looking forward to the time late this decade when a single currency would make it as easy for a French company to pump gasoline in Barcelona or Berlin as in Lyons. But then this spring, Loik Le Floch-Prigent, Elf's chairman and chief executive, heard many of his own employees speak against the Maastricht treaty that would bring about this unification. Some innocently asked him where he stood.
Mr. Floch-Prigent, joining other French business leaders to found the "Yes Committee," has since taken his cause to television, radio and newspapers, as well as his own refineries and plants. The prosperity of their companies and their expansion across the Continent, the business leaders say, rests on the referendum tomorrow. 
 A no vote, they say, would whipsaw them with continued currency turmoil and higher interest rates, as speculators rushed again into marks, weakening the franc. The persistence of separate currencies would render some of their strategies through the end of the century obsolete.
 
No Scenario for Defeat
 Under the sponsorship of Merrill Lynch & Company, the French executives gathered yesterday to promote their companies to investors at New York's Metropolitan Club, a gilded, frescoed palace where American plutocrats can feel like royalty from Europe.
In interviews, all the business leaders expressed brave confidence, with none confessing to laying contingency plans in case the referendum fails. "There is no scenario for a no vote," said Bernard Thiolon, the president of Credit Lyonnais, France's largest bank, with a dismissive toss of his head. "You cannot prevent a bank like us from having a presence in every market."
A minute later, however, he worried that a rejection by voters would delay the unification of banking services for years, slowing his march into other countries.
The executives' support for the creation of a single currency by 1999 represents the latest stage in the turnabout of what was long one of Europe's most protected business communities. French Governments have shielded their industries at least as far back as when Jean-Baptiste Colbert served as controller general to Louis XIV. Now, the French say that dismantling Europe's trade barriers has helped them export more per person than even the Japanese.
Several executives pointed to the currency crisis as one more reason for adopting a single currency. Only then, they said, could Europe capably compete with Japan and the United States. "If you had 50 different dollars -- a Colorado dollar, a Nevada dollar, a North Carolina dollar -- you would be much weaker," Mr. Floch-Prigent said.
Rejection of the referendum, they said, would expose them to much greater risks or the expenses of hedging. Many of the executives would then welcome a unified currency covering just France, Germany and a couple other countries with strong currencies.
Most are set to erase the borders from the atlas. Bertrand Collomb, the chairman and chief executive of Lafarge Coppee, the world's second-largest cement company, stretched out his arms, as if holding up a map, to illustrate the stakes for a maker of building materials.
"If you look at a map of Europe," he said, "there are no good connections between France and Spain, between France and the Netherlands. You need more high-speed trains, highways, airports."
Even the most ardent backers of unification shifted in their seats and frowned, however, when asked about meddling by Eurobureaucrats from Brussels. Referendum foes have warned that the stature of French industry, the distinctiveness of French culture, even the pre-eminence of French wine, would collapse under the weight of European regulation.
"The bureaucrats have been irritating a lot of people," Mr. Floch-Prigent of Elf said. "Many people in my company think, 'We will vote against the bureaucrats.' "
Patrick Bompoint, executive vice president for finance at Remy Cointreau, said that the referendum's passage would in fact mean more uniform taxes and regulations for his company, which sells more liquor in Germany than France.
In the short term, though, his company will reap some benefits no matter which side wins. "There will be a celebration," Mr. Bompoint said with a generous chuckle, "and that is an opportunity to drink Cognac or Champagne."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN EUROPE;
Winds of Change Blow, and Europe's Governments Feel the Chill

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

 BODY:
The storm buffeting Europe is a strong one, but it has not yet uprooted a government or tossed a leader aside. The leaders on the Continent all are buttoning up, however, as the vote on European union approaches.
 
Jacques Delors
European Community Leader
 Jacques Delors, the head of the European Community's executive commission, is often referred to as Mr. Europe. After taking office in 1985, he breathed life into the flagging community, committing it to create a single regional market by Jan. 1, 1992, then promoting the idea of a single currency. 
 It is not surprising, then, that he considers eight years of campaigning for closer integration in the balance. French rejection of the treaty on Sunday would require a fundamental rethinking of community policy, which he believes could be better managed by a successor. If they say "no," Mr. Delors warns, he will resign in December.
His premature departure would strike a severe psychological blow at faith in European unity. None of his predecessors since the community was formed in 1957 enjoyed his power or displayed his vision.
A stocky intense former Finance Minister, Mr. Delors fervently believes the treaty, which commits the community to closer political as well as economic ties, is essential to withstand competition from the United States and Japan. He even sees it as a step toward creation of a federal Europe.
But he has been thrown on the defensive by attacks on his executive commission, which critics say exercises too much power over national governments.
This week's crisis in European currency markets, Mr. Delors has insisted, came as no surprise. Rather, he said, it was further proof of the community's need for tighter monetary union and a single currency.

HEADLINE: And Now a Word From Our Announcer;
30 Years Before the Mike: Inside Work, No Heavy Lifting (Fame Not Included)

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
He can do a smooth delivery. He can do what he calls a "smash-them-in-the-mouth" delivery (popular for pushing analgesics). He can do an average-guy-on-the-street delivery. He can do a quiet, syrupy delivery that makes you feel warm and joyous inside and think what an awfully sweet man that is talking to you.
Chances are you've heard his voice before -- perhaps obstinately elaborating on the grip of dental adhesive or breaking the news about the reductions in your health benefits during that personnel film (that takes the syrupy delivery). 
 But you never get his name. Here is the name: Ken Allen.
Mr. Allen is a voice for hire. Pay the right price and he'll talk -- and talk and talk. As a freelance announcer available for commercials, corporate films and station break announcements, he is one of a motley crew of malleable voices heard a lot but rarely seen and never identified.
"We don't take credit for what we do," he said the other day between talking assignments. "It's an anonymous way of life. And, to tell the truth, I like it that way. I'm sort of a private guy. I have never had an appetite to do things that were exotic. I've never wanted to be a star."
Every sizable city boasts loquacious freelance announcers, and there are a few dozen willing voices who operate in and around New York. Ken Allen has managed to keep going as a journeyman voice for about 30 years. He doesn't like to specify his age, but he's no kid. He will say only that he can ably do roles for someone in his 50's.
A husky man with well-chiseled features, Mr. Allen is blessed with a pleasing baritone. When he talks, even to a wrong number, every word is enunciated just so. No slurs, no mumbling. He projects. Chatting with him is like talking to the evening news.
If something needs to be said, Mr. Allen will say it, but most often he is hired as a product spokesman or as a narrator of a film. He's talked for American Airlines, Tide, Bufferin, Cadillac, Federal Express and I.B.M. Usually, there's just the voice, though sometimes he shows up on camera, too. For example, that's him in the current commercials for Sea Bond dental adhesive telling you how "it holds them comfortably all day long."
Mr. Allen tackles his share of film work, and at times is inclined to regard himself as an actor. Unfortunately, the films are not great starring vehicles. All too often, they'll be about pension plans. But then, he did play a captain in an Army training film and he was a doctor in several medical films. It adds up. The work allows one to become skilled in areas not many people become skilled in. "I would say I'm an expert in narrating health and benefits information," Mr. Allen said. "I've got that stuff down cold."
The other day, blackening clouds packing the skies, Mr. Allen caught the train into Manhattan from his home in Darien, Conn., to fulfill some talking assignments. First he hastened to a film-editing center on West 44th Street. He had been there before, to speak some lines in a film that the client wished to keep under wraps. One line had somehow been overlooked, so Mr. Allen needed to complete it.
The line was: "C'mon, you folks, we have a lot to do today. Let's hurry up."
Mr. Allen did it once animatedly, and the producer suggested, "A little more of a pause, so 'hurry up' will fall into his open mouth."
After the second take, the producer said, "I think that's very good."
In six minutes, Mr. Allen was finished.
Over the years, Mr. Allen has had a wordy career. He fell into radio as a teen-ager when he was the janitor at a station in Framingham, Mass. He fully expected to move beyond floors, and not long afterward became a staff announcer at a radio station in Holyoke, Mass., where he read the news, read the commercials, introduced the music, did station promos. He moved his voice to an Albany station before settling in at a radio and TV station in Hartford.
He thought he would sample moonlighting, so he auditioned for a job with New England Telephone telling customers about push-button phones. There were 102 applicants; Mr. Allen's voice won.
Emboldened, he decided he was ready for New York and, in 1963, got hired as an announcer for CBS. Once in a while, he was the standby announcer for Lowell Thomas. If Mr. Thomas were to get sick, Mr. Allen would do the talking. Mr. Thomas did not get sick.
"As a staff announcer, you were bigger than life," Mr. Allen recalled. "People think of me as being very elegant sounding, as having a sophisticated, cultivated voice. I was influenced as a staff announcer, because we all tried to be very dignified. You thought God was talking when one of us went on."
After four years, Mr. Allen decided to leave CBS. He has been a freelance mouth ever since.
 
A Comfortable Living
 Voice pay fluctuates a lot, though union rules dictate minimums. A local radio commercial pays at least $275, which includes use of the spot for 13 weeks. A voice-over on a local television commercial pays at least $662 for 13 weeks' use; an on-camera spot rises to $936 for a day's work. The fee to narrate a corporate film starts at $285 for the first hour plus $84 for each subsequent half hour and escalates to two or three times that for seasoned veterans. All told, a busy freelance announcer can collect more than $100,000 a year.
Mr. Allen said he has made a comfortable living, though talking assignments have dwindled in recent years as a consequence of the sputtering economy. He does about two jobs a week, whereas he used to average five easily. Maybe that's just as well, because the work can be harsh on the body. "I've gone into sessions where I've lost weight," Mr. Allen said. "I come out of the studio and I'm down five or six pounds."
Away from the microphone, Mr. Allen is quieter. He raises racing pigeons. He has about 60 at his home. It takes a lot of training. You start the pigeons about five miles from home and wait for them to return. Then you drop them farther and farther away. Sometimes you never see them again and you deal with the loss.
In early afternoon, rain drumming down, Mr. Allen arrived dripping at a studio at 231 East 55th Street. Karen Miller, a freelance producer, greeted him warmly and ushered him into a studio. She handed him the script.
The assignment was to read a brief opening and close to be edited onto an I.B.M. film -- already shot -- promoting a medical application of an I.B.M. mainframe computer. The entire script was a mere three sentences.
Mr. Allen read aloud the opening, testing the words, exploring the proper modulation, trying out pauses: "When most people think of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, they immediately think of a picturesque college town, home to the University of North Carolina's record-breaking Tar Heels basketball team, and its favorite son, Coach Dean Smith. But just down the road from the Dean Dome are the University of North Carolina Hospitals, where another kind of winning streak is happening."
Ms. Miller signaled it was time to start. Standing erect at the microphone, Mr. Allen gave it his all.
"I think you have to punch up Tar Heels a little more and punch up Dean Dome," Ms. Miller said.
"I think I know what you're talking about," Mr. Allen replied. "A little more animation."
"Give me about 10 percent more energy," Ms. Miller said.
Mr. Allen got carried away and gave about 20 percent more energy.
"That was really good," Ms. Miller said. "But when you start, use a little warmer tone."
Then it was too fast.
Then it was too slow in one part and too fast in another.
Then it was too fast at the beginning.
Then it was too slow.
Then it was still too slow.
Then it was too loud.
Then it wasn't natural.
Then it was all right.
Mr. Allen moved on to the close, a single sentence that sounded good on the first try.
"I liked it," Ms. Miller said. "I think we're going to do it again just because I like to do things a lot of times."
Then it was too fast at the end.
Then he flubbed "formulated."
Then Ms. Miller said, "That was so good we're trying to think of a way to improve it and we can't."
"Oh, great," Mr. Allen said.
Everyone shook hands and Mr. Allen hurried to catch the train home. Having uttered 110 words, his professional day was done.

HEADLINE: Bonds Mixed Awaiting French Vote

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended mixed yesterday as long-term bonds fell early in the day but recovered in the afternoon ahead of tomorrow's vote in France on economic unity.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond was up 1/16 point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, was 7.32 percent, unchanged from late Thursday. 
 Traders and investors were reluctant to hold large positions over the weekend for fear that the French vote would further roil the international currency and securities markets, which are already in disarray because of a currency crisis in Europe.
The 30-year bond hit a low of 98 1/2, but then began retracing its losses in midafternoon. The recovery was based on rumors that Barron's, the financial weekly, would report today that if Bill Clinton is elected he would appoint Robert Rubin, a managing director at Goldman, Sachs, as Treasury Secretary.
Knight-Ridder Financial News reported that Mr. Rubin is believed to be interested in stopping further sales of 30-year Treasury bonds. A halt of new bonds would push up the price of 30-year securities already issued. Barron's declined to confirm or deny the rumors.
A Goldman, Sachs spokesman said yesterday that Mr. Rubin had not been interviewed by Barron's and that he had not made any public statements about the advisability of eliminating 30-year bond sales.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term maturities rose 1/32 and intermediate maturities fell between 1/32 and 1/8 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.

Dutch-British Merger Forms Publishing Giant

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The Dutch publisher Elsevier N.V. and Reed International P.L.C. of Britain have announced a stock merger that will create one of the world's largest publishing empires, with sales of nearly $5 billion a year.
The new corporation, to be called Reed Elsevier, will trail such media giants as Time Warner Inc. and Bertelsmann A.G. in size, but because Reed and Elsevier have relatively little debt, the new enterprise will be able to expand its operations far more easily than can competitors like Time Warner. 
 And while Bertelsmann and Time Warner are committed largely to consumer publishing, Reed Elsevier will also be heavily involved in business-to-business publishing.
 
Terms of the Deal
 Under the deal, which was announced Thursday, each company will own 50 percent of the new business. Stockholders of each of the companies will receive shares in the newly formed enterprise.
Both companies have extensive holdings in the United States. Reed owns Cahners Publishing, and Reed publications, which number more than 70, include Variety and Modern Bride. Elsevier is a leading publisher of scientific journals in the United States and abroad.
Analysts say that with the prices of American media properties depressed, continued expansion in the United States is likely. Reed's chairman, Peter Davis, confirmed that view in a telephone interview yesterday.
"We want business-to-business and professional-information businesses," Mr. Davis said. "We want good, sound, long-run businesses."
He added, referring to businesses that do not depend on advertising revenues, that "both of us place a higher value on businesses that are less cyclical."
 
Mixed Sources of Revenue
 Reed owns many publications that depend on both subscription and advertising revenues, like Modern Bride. Mr. Davis said 40 percent of Reed's revenue came from advertising.
"I would buy Variety again," he said. "It has the subscription revenue and newsstand sales revenues. But Martindale-Hubbell, that we can put on CD and on line, is the sort of business we are even more keen on." Martindale-Hubbell Inc. publishes a law directory that provides biographical information and ratings on more than 800,000 lawyers; the service is also available to computer users.
Besides possible acquisitions in the United States, the companies are also interested in exploring deals in Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
Despite the worldwide economic weakness, the two companies are forecasting a 24 percent increase in profits for this calender year.
Reed had 1991 profits of $243 million on sales of $2.84 billion, while Elsevier had profits of $217 million on sales of $1.34 billion. The higher profit margins of Elsevier reflect its ownership of publications that are less heavily dependent on advertising than are those of its rivals.

HOWARD SAVINGS UNABLE TO LIFT CAPITAL RATIO

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Howard Savings Bank said it was not able to increase its capital to meet the required ratio imposed by regulators. The Newark-based savings bank received a cease and desist order yesterday from the New Jersey Department of Banking requiring the bank to increase its leverage capital ratio to 4 percent by Sept. 30. Howard's leverage capital ratio, or common equity divided by average assets, was 1.53 percent as of June 30. The savings bank said it would be unable to meet the leverage ratio because of its level of nonperforming assets and the current economic condition.

HEADLINE: Turf Battles Are Beginning Over Atlanta Olympics

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The Olympic flag arrived in the heart of the South today, two years to the day after Atlanta was designated as the surprise host for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games.
But even before the flag got here something else did: a recognition that having sold the world a vision of itself as an amicable, multiracial, civil rights capital in a world increasingly racked by racial and ethnic strife, Atlanta now has to live up to it. 
 Two years after Atlanta went into ecstasy over its long-shot Olympic designation, emotions about the Games are still high but a lot more complicated. Along with boosters, the flag's arrival from Barcelona, Spain, today brought out 5,000 demonstrators protesting what they described as plans for an exploitative low-wage Olympiad. Some frustrated black officials assert that the Games, sold to the world on the image of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and held in one of the nation's poorest cities, are being unduly controlled by rich, white suburbanites.
Few people doubt that Atlanta grabbed the opportunity of a city's lifetime by getting the multibillion-dollar prize of the 1996 Games, the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympics. And people who follow the Olympics say this sort of turf battle between competing interest groups is not unusual for this stage of the Games.
But amid a flurry of dust-ups over things as small as Atlanta's ill-received, slug-like mascot, Whatizit; as predictable as who will profit, and as large as the vision that the Games will project, it has become clear that mounting the $1.35 billion Games and playing host to about two million visitors may be the least of Atlanta's problems.
The biggest challenge may be the human and urban revitalization many expect the Games to bring to a city that symbolizes much of the pain and promise of race in America.
"It will be a travesty if the Games are presented and if nothing is fundamentally done to improve Atlanta in the process," said Bill Campbell, an Atlanta City Councilman. "This can't come down to putting on a great track meet. My grave concern is that we're losing this grand opportunity."
The two men most responsible for Atlanta's getting the Games, Billy Payne, president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, and former Mayor Andrew Young, the Olympics co-chairman, say the Atlanta Olympics from their inception have been about more than sport. Both say the questions now have more to do with what kind of vision will emerge and what role will be played by groups like local governments and Jimmy Carter's Atlanta Project.
"This has always been a passion and a cause," Mr. Payne said.
But both he and Mr. Young say the money that will be raised to mount the Games will cover just that job -- not rebuilding inner-city Atlanta. And who does the rest, with what resources and in what form, is already shaping up as a drama that will traverse the fault lines of race and poverty common to urban America and the South in particular.
Atlanta's host role kicked off this week with an Olympic Flag Jam concert that brought out President Bush Thursday night and with a ceremony this morning welcoming the flag to Atlanta. But ever since the glittering Barcelona Olympics, the magnitude of Atlanta's challenge has come into sharp focus.
The comparisons with Barcelona, the difficulty of reconfiguring downtown Atlanta as a visitor-friendly pedestrian setting, and questions on finance and race have left some people wondering if Atlanta is up to the task.
"Barcelona was a big success and so was Los Angeles, but the memory of Montreal is always there," said Dana White, an Emory University expert on Atlanta's history, referring to Montreal's financial debacle after the city was host to the 1976 Games. "Part of Atlanta's booster spirit is that people talk a good game, but I think there's still some very serious doubts about whether we can pull it off."
 
'Enormous Confidence'
 One major concern is that the loss that NBC took on the Barcelona Olympics makes it highly unlikely an American network will spend anything close to the $600 million for the American television rights that the Atlanta organizers have projected.
But the Atlanta committee figures to gain in international television rights what it falls short on in domestic ones. And with plans progressing to market sponsorships for around $40 million each, experts say the Atlanta organizers are on track to raise the money they need. In fact, experts who study the Games say the Atlanta committee's performance in putting together its bid and beginning the plans for the Games has been extraordinarily sure-footed thus far.
"There's enormous confidence in Atlanta internationally," said John MacAloon, a University of Chicago anthropologist who studies the Olympics. "This is a highly internationalized and sophisticated group of people running the Games."
Professor MacAloon said Atlanta's toughest challenge may have more to do with image and vision than the nuts and bolts of putting on the competition.
"Atlanta is expected to contribute and to some extent was selected for the images of biracial and multiracial cooperation," he said.
 
'There Are Two Atlantas'
 But the images and the political and economic achievements of blacks in Atlanta can obscure the reality of a poor city, largely black, surrounded by a rich metropolitan area, largely white. The fact that the Games are controlled largely by wealthy whites is not lost on local city officials. Some are seething over what they see as a lack of input into the planning process. Unlike Barcelona, where city officials had a major share in mounting the Games, in Atlanta the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games is a private nonprofit corporation with no formal ties to local governments.
"The games were sold on it being a harmonious environment, of people living together and working together and everybody's happy," said Jared Samples, an Atlanta Councilman. "But the reality is there are two Atlantas, those who have and those who have not. I'm quite sure there will be some things said and done over the coming months that will show the true divisions that exist."
But as Mr. Payne and Mr. Young point out, the Games represent not just the 400,000 people of the city of Atlanta but also the 2.8 million in the metropolitan area and the 6.4 million in Georgia. And if some in the city are suspicious of the Atlanta committee, many suburbanites see Atlanta's concerns as just a push for more of the Olympic pie.
"This isn't about anything other than base human nature," said Claibourne Darden Jr., a political poll taker. "A number of people apparently are unhappy because they can't line their pockets or their group's status to a degree sufficient to please them."
 
Unions Seek Participation
 The financial issues go beyond race. The city has a wish list of more than $500 million in proposed projects for the downtown area, where much of the Olympics activities will take place, but so far has no way to pay for them. At a march sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. today, demonstrators called for more union participation in construction and accused the Atlanta committee of planning a low-wage Games that would depress wages locally.
But many of the knottiest issues revolve around race. There is a stalled plan to revitalize the Techwood Public Housing Project that sits at the edge of what is supposed to be the Olympic Village. There are fears by neighborhood people who say they will be displaced by the proposed Olympic Stadium. There are sensitive questions about the cultural symbols for the Games that have led some to wonder whether the committee is planning a bland, neutered cultural landscape with a dollop of Dr. King and a dollop of country music but steering clear of anything more visceral.
Mr. Payne heatedly denies it. And Mr. Young points to figures indicating 46 percent of contracts so far have gone to companies owned by minorities or women as proof of the Atlanta committee's sensitivity.
To some, the jostling for position, given the size of the stakes, is not unusual, either for business as usual in Atlanta or for the Olympics.
"My view is this is the tension from which creativity emerges," said Michael Lomax, Commissioner of Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta. "I think we're going to come up with something which is rich, which is dynamic, which is not always harmonious, but is the reality of the new American city which I think Atlanta represents."
But in an America racked by urban despair, Atlanta's bid and history raised the social ante much the way Barcelona's dazzling Games raised the bar for the overall presentation of the Games.
"If this society can't do something creative about race in the Olympic arena," said John Hoberman, a University of Texas professor who studies the Olympics, "where you have unique kinds of opportunity, a very visible black presence and a celebrated one at that; if you can't do something creative about race relations in that context, then God help us."
