Oil Prices Hit Highest Levels Since the Persian Gulf War

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Oil prices surged yesterday to their highest levels since Iraq invaded Kuwait 12 years ago, buoyed by a combination of cold weather and a weekly government report that showed low inventories of oil and petroleum products.
 In New York, crude oil for April delivery rose to $37.93 a barrel during trading yesterday before closing at $37.70, up $1.64, or 4.6 percent. 
 In after-hours over-the-counter trading, the price surpassed $38 a barrel, traders said, as an already jittery market reacted to reports that North Korea had reactivated a long-dormant nuclear reactor. 
Traders and industry analysts said they expected prices to remain volatile for some time, a trend, some fear, that could further strain the weak global economy. 
"When you start hitting these type of numbers, that means there is some kind of pain in the industry," said Thomas P. Bentz, senior energy analyst with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures. "In this case, they could hurt the consumer, hurt the economy, and there could be a backlash against the oil industry."
Oil traders said the sharp one-day jump in prices reflected alarm among many in the market after weekly data from the Energy Department regarding crude oil and petroleum products disclosed a decline in inventories in most categories. The Energy Department estimated that crude oil inventories fell by a million barrels, to 271.9 million. Stocks in the Midwest had dropped "to only 50.1 million barrels, the lowest ever since the Department of Energy began tracking regional inventories," according to a report by UBS Warburg. 
In the Northeast, inventories of distillate, which includes heating oil, fell by 4.5 million barrels to their lowest level since May 2000, according to the UBS Warburg report. At the same time, the Northeast's demand for distillate rose to 4.5 million barrels a day, a sign of the growing appetite for heating oil because of the region's protracted cold weather, Mr. Bentz said.
The buildup to yesterday's price spike has been months in the making, said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, as production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries took hold through most of last year. OPEC began carrying out the output reductions starting in early 2002 because global supplies of oil were high and demand for oil was weak. According to Mr. Goldstein, OPEC's production fell by three million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2002, compared with the period a year earlier, then by two million barrels a day in the second quarter.
"Quietly, invisibly, with every day that went by, stocks started to unwind and prices began to rise to the high 20's," Mr. Goldstein said. "Then the Venezuelans go on strike when stocks are already tight, and you lose 2.3 million barrels a day of exports."
The loss of Venezuelan supplies occurred just as a cold winter settled upon much of the northern United States. Demand for heating oil grew, and profit margins increased for refiners for the first time in months. To make up for the disappearance of Venezuelan supplies, OPEC promised more oil from the Middle East to American refiners. But those shipments take about 40 days to reach the United States.
In the interim, refiners, eager to take advantage of those higher consumer prices, began to draw upon their own stocks of crude oil. But those stocks have now fallen so low -- to about 270 million barrels -- that they have reached what the industry calls minimum operating levels, the bare minimum the oil system needs to operate safely. As a result, Mr. Goldstein said, refiners cut their output. All this despite the fact that the cold weather has yet to relent.
Traders said they had expected to see somewhat higher inventory data this week because they thought the crude oil shipments from the Middle East might have arrived in the United States by now. But the data had yet to reflect that, they said, and the price jumped as a result.
Traders also said they thought that comments made on Tuesday before the Senate by the energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, indicated a new willingness on the part of the Bush administration to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, should a war with Iraq take place. Prices softened as a consequence. But by yesterday, Mr. Bentz and others said, traders had a chance to digest Mr. Abraham's comments and understood that the administration's approach to oil markets remained unchanged.
"Abraham said nothing new," Mr. Bentz said. "That is what he has said all along, that they would not release the oil unless it was necessary, and so far, they didn't deem it necessary."

HEADLINE: 4 Accused of Illegally Sending Money to Iraq 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Federal authorities charged four men yesterday with illegally funneling at least $4 million to Iraq through a charity in Syracuse.
 Those named in a 14-count indictment include an oncologist, an imam at a state prison and the director of the charity -- which operates under the name Help the Needy -- the authorities said. 
 "Those who covertly seek to channel money into Iraq under the guise of charitable work will be caught and prosecuted," Attorney General John Ashcroft said in a prepared statement. "As President Bush leads an international coalition to end Saddam Hussein's tyranny and support for terror," he said, "the Justice Department will see that individuals within our borders cannot undermine these efforts." 
The indictments included no charges of terrorism, and federal officials said they did not know where the money ended up in Iraq or its intended use. Nonetheless, they said, any money transfers to Iraq without federal approval violate sanctions in place since 1990.
A lawyer for the oncologist said yesterday that his client had worked enthusiastically with the Syracuse charity "out of humanitarian concerns that are shared by millions of other Americans."
"He does not believe he did anything wrong or unpatriotic," said the lawyer, Edward Z. Menkin, who is representing Dr. Rafil Dhafir, 55. Dr. Dhafir, who practices in Rome, N.Y., is identified on several Web sites as the founder of Help the Needy. He is a United States citizen who was born in Iraq.
The others named in the indictment are Maher Zagha, 34, a Jordanian citizen living in Amman who attended college in Utica and Syracuse; Ayman Jarwan, 33, a Jordanian working in the Syracuse area as executive director of Help the Needy; and Osameh al-Wahaidy, 41, an imam at the prison, the Auburn Correctional Facility, who also teaches math at the State University College at Oswego.
Help the Needy and a related organization, Help the Needy Endowment Inc., were also named as defendants. Phone messages left at the charities' offices in Syracuse yesterday were not returned.
The charges include conspiracy to violate federal sanctions against Iraq under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Dr. Dhafir and Mr. Zagha were also charged with money-laundering. 
The three defendants living in the United States were arrested yesterday morning, federal officials said.
According to the indictment, Dr. Dhafir and the other defendants set up Help the Needy without obtaining a license required to provide humanitarian aid to Iraq.
Prosecutors said the charity solicited donations through false or misleading statements.
Some of the money it raised was deposited in accounts held by the charity at Oneida Savings Bank and Key Bank, then transferred to a personal account under the name of Mr. Zagha, the indictment said.
Money was transferred out of the country to the Jordan Islamic Bank in Amman, the indictment said, adding that the money was transferred to individuals in Iraq.

HEADLINE: McGreevey's Nominee to Lead Port Authority Withdraws 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb 26 

 BODY:
Gov. James E. McGreevey's nominee for chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey today asked to withdraw his name from consideration and resigned from the board, amid complaints that his generous contributions to New Jersey Democrats may have violated campaign-finance and conflict-of-interest laws.
 Charles Kushner, a real estate developer who was the single most prolific donor to Mr. McGreevey's 2001 campaign, was appointed to the Port Authority board last February and was the governor's choice to become chairman in April. But his bid for the job began to sputter early this month, when a former employee filed a lawsuit claiming that Mr. Kushner had improperly allocated money from his businesses to make donations to favored candidates. 
 The United States attorney's office in Newark opened an investigation into the allegations, and Republican legislators began pointing to Mr. Kushner's appointment as the kind of political patronage that Mr. McGreevey had vowed to end when he was elected. After Mr. Kushner declined a request that he answer questions before the State Senate Judiciary Committee, a Republican lawmaker, Senator William L. Gormley of Atlantic County, released documents this week saying that Mr. Kushner may have violated a state law that prohibits anyone who owns more than 10 percent of a bank from making political contributions.
Mr. Kushner called those charges "baseless" and "innuendo" and said he had a legal expert review every contribution he and his employees made during the past two years to ensure that he complied with campaign-finance laws. In announcing his resignation from the board today, Mr. Kushner said that he wanted to spare his family the ordeal of a bitter confirmation process and allow Governor McGreevey to find a chairman who could focus on the agency's role in redeveloping the World Trade Center site, which it owns.
"The Port Authority faces too many important goals and decisions to be distracted by the political nonsense and bickering generated by local partisan politics," he said in a written statement.
Mr. McGreevey had expressed enthusiastic support for Mr. Kushner until the documents released by Senator Gormley on Monday raised new questions about his compliance with campaign-finance laws. In a written statement today, the governor called Mr. Kushner's decision to leave the authority board "regrettable."
"His integrity, decency and commitment to the highest ethical standards are beyond reproach," he said.
The collapse of Mr. Kushner's nomination comes as Mr. McGreevey's standing in public opinion polls has been hurt by the state's budget woes, several embarrassing appointments and press coverage critical of his use of state money to entertain relatives in Ireland and shower legislators with Christmas gifts.
The governor today tried to put the issue to rest quickly, announcing that he had nominated Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, to be the chairman of the Port Authority board. But Mr. McGreevey also held out the possibility that Mr. Kushner might be offered some other appointment in the future, if he can resolve the dispute over his campaign contributions.
Republicans appeared unwilling to let the matter drop. Hours before Mr. Kushner withdrew from the Port Authority, State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., the Republican Party's state chairman, wrote to the acting attorney general, Peter C. Harvey, asking for an investigation of the millions in campaign cash Mr. Kushner gave Democrats, including the $1.5 million that went directly to Mr. McGreevey's campaign.
"Mr. Kushner's resignation does not resolve the issue of potentially illegal campaign contributions he has made as a major contributor to New Jersey's Democrat Party," Mr. Kyrillos said. "It is the duty of the state attorney general to enforce the law."
Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, a Republican from Morris Plains, today called on any elected official or committee that received donations from Mr. Kushner and his companies to return the money.
Republicans charge that the donations violated the ban on campaign donations by bank owners because Mr. Kushner and his children control 20 percent of the NorCrown Bank in Morristown. 
But Mr. Kushner's lawyers insist that the donations were legal because he only owns 5.6 percent of the bank, and his children's trust funds control another 13.5 percent.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: MILITARY SPENDING; 
Bush and Pentagon Wrangle Over War Budget Request

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The Pentagon and the White House budget office are wrestling over how much money to seek from Congress to pay for a war against Iraq and reconstruction costs between now and the end of September.
 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the budget director, met with President Bush on war costs on Tuesday. Officials from both agencies said no decision was made about the amount to ask for. 
 Normally in these cases, the Defense Department wants a high figure, the budget office wants a low one and the final budget request is between. Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas and the majority leader, said Congress would support "whatever the president deems necessary to fight this war." 
Pentagon officials said today that the military's part of the cost over the next seven months, through the fiscal year, would be at least $60 billion. That would include food, pay, munitions and transportation. It would also cover new costs of the military's campaign against terrorists in Afghanistan and other countries and domestic security missions like fighter patrols over New York and Washington.
Billions more would be borne by the State Department, including $15 billion promised to Turkey and aid expected to be offered to Israel, Jordan, Egypt and other countries.
The Pentagon estimates that it is already spending about $1.6 billion in the campaign against terrorists and that it has spent $2.4 billion so far for the buildup in the Persian Gulf region.
A senior Defense Department official who fielded budget questions from reporters today disputed articles in several newspapers asserting that Pentagon planners were pegging the cost in this fiscal year at $60 billion to $95 billion.
"Sixty billion is closer to the truth than 95 billion," the official said. He said $95 billion was probably too high for the Defense and State Department costs together.
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said no budget request to cover a war would be made to Congress before military action began. 
The Pentagon would also have big future expenses. Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told Congress on Tuesday that several hundred thousand troops would remain in Iraq to provide security and relief aid. 
The Persian Gulf war in 1991 cost $61 billion, which amounts to about $80 billion in today's dollars. About 80 percent of the cost was picked up by allies. The allied contribution in a war against Iraq is expected to be much smaller.
The president did not include war costs in the budget he sent to Congress this month. The budget projects deficits over $300 billion in the current fiscal year. In the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, the budget projects record figures in actual dollars but a somewhat smaller deficit as a percentage of the national economy than some deficits in the 1980's and early 1990's.
If there is a war, it will increase the deficit and could raise qualms in Congress about approving the large tax cuts Mr. Bush wants. 
Mr. Fleischer said the president would not back down from the tax cuts. "The president believes one of the best ways to help the economy grow is to provide the tax relief that can give a boost to the economy and create jobs for the American people," Mr. Fleischer said. "Whether or not the president authorizes the use of force, the American people deserve to have jobs."
In a speech in the Senate today, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia and the most senior senator, criticized the administration for not being more forthcoming about the cost of war.
"Our people and this Congress," Mr. Byrd said, "should not have to wait until our troops are sent to fight to know what we are facing, including the painful costs of this war in dollars, political turmoil and blood."

E-Mail Suggests Analyst Coached WorldCom Chief
As shares of WorldCom were falling a year ago, the company's founder, Bernard J. Ebbers, spoke out in a call with analysts and swatted down rumors of financial problems. According to an e-mail message uncovered by federal regulators, Mr. Ebbers received a good deal of help with his rousing script from Jack B. Grubman, the telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
 While there is nothing illegal about an analyst advising a chief executive on how to approach a conference call, providing such detailed coaching, as the e-mail message does, is highly unusual and seems to indicate that Mr. Grubman considered himself a close adviser to Mr. Ebbers, playing a role that would normally be the task of a corporate insider or public relations specialist.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." Her book on the increasing economic and cultural importance of aesthetics will be published in September by HarperCollins. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com.

 BODY:
HERE's a game economists play: Player 1 has $10 and can give any dollar amount to Player 2. Player 2 can either accept or reject it. If Player 2 accepts, they both keep the money. If Player 2 rejects it, neither player gets anything.
 What should the players do? Arguably, Player 2 should accept whatever is offered, since some money is better than none. Player 1 should thus offer as little as possible: $1. That strategy is the standard game-theory equilibrium. 
 But that's not necessarily what happens when real people play this "ultimatum game" in laboratory settings with real money on the line. Faced with low-ball offers, many Player 2's reject them. And many Player 1's make more generous offers, often nearly half the money.
"About half the subjects that we observed played according to the way the game theory said people should play, and about half didn't," said Kevin McCabe, an economist and director of the Behavioral and Neuroeconomics Laboratory at George Mason University.
The Player 1's who do not follow the presumably rational strategy often wind up better off. Even without communicating with fellow players, they are able to cooperate for mutual benefit.
Why do people react differently to the same situation? And why do so many people give up money to punish anonymous cheapskates?
Experimental economists have mapped out these anomalies and tested how much they affect economic interactions. Now a new field, called neuroeconomics, is using the tools of neuroscience to find the underlying biological mechanisms that lead people to act, or not act, according to economic theory.
In neuroeconomics, volunteers go through exercises developed by experimental economists studying trust or risk. Instead of simply observing subjects' behavior, however, researchers use imaging technologies, like M.R.I.'s, to see which brain areas are active during the experiment.
Researchers at Princeton, for instance, have found that receiving low-ball offers stimulates the part of the brain associated with disgust. "They can predict with good reliability, from looking at the brain, what a person will do," said Colin F. Camerer, an economist at the California Institute of Technology. "People whose brains are showing lots of disgust will reject offers."
Professor Camerer says looking inside the brain's "black box" is like looking inside a company. Traditionally, economists treated a company as a largely automatic "production function" that turns labor, capital and resources into output. Over the last several decades, however, many economists have turned their attention to understanding companies' internal workings. Most prominently, "agency theory" examines how companies can be governed to encourage employees (the "agents") to pursue the goals of the owners, rather than their personal agendas.
This research hasn't replaced the production-function approach, but it has enriched economists' understanding of company behavior. Neuroeconomists want to do something similar for how individuals make economic choices.
"Neuroeconomics could be to consumer theory what agency theory is to the production-function approach," Professor Camerer said.
While many economists remain skeptical, neuroscientists have welcomed the interest. 
"Anyone working with the brain likes this approach because economists have these nicely defined behavioral models," said Paul Zak, an economist and director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University.
Neuroscientists do experiments like looking at which parts of the brain are active when someone looks at photographs and decides which faces are trustworthy. Neuroeconomists don't just ask people to use their imaginations, though -- they have subjects play laboratory games to find out what happens in real interactions.
Professor Zak and his colleagues study trust with a variation of the ultimatum game. Each player receives $10. Player 1 gets an additional $10. Players interact anonymously over computers. Player 1 can send any whole-dollar amount to Player 2. Whatever he sends is tripled, so a $5 gift turns into $15. Finally, Player 2 can return some of the money to Player 1.
If Player 1 expects Player 2 not to send any money in return, Player 1 will keep the initial stake. That's the game's standard equilibrium.
"In fact," Professor Zak said, "most people send about half of their stake to Player 2. They're signaling that they want to trust them." In response, about 75 percent of the Player 2's return some money, making both better off.
"Even though we can't see each other and we don't know each other, we understand the other person as a human being," Professor Zak said. Extrapolating from animal results, he hypothesized that the hormone oxytocin, which is associated with social bonding, might play a role.
"When you read the studies on lower mammals," he said, "everything suggests that this is a candidate to induce trustworthiness because it's something that you would not consciously be aware of and yet it would influence decision making."
Researchers tested each subject's blood for eight different hormones right after the person made the decision about whether to send money. For Player 1, no hormone appeared to make a difference. But the more money the Player 2's received, the higher their oxytocin, even after controlling for factors like age, sex and menstrual cycle timing. The higher the oxytocin, the more money each Player 2 returned.
That response didn't correlate with various personality measures. "It's not that these people who returned more money are just nicer," Professor Zak said.
Neuroeconomists caution that their research is just starting. But that does not reduce their enthusiasm.
"For me, it's just an extremely exciting area in terms of potential," Professor McCabe said. "There's always new findings every day."

HEADLINE: Analyst Coached WorldCom Chief on His Script 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
As shares of WorldCom were falling on rumbles of a pending financial crisis a year ago, the company's founder, Bernard J. Ebbers, took to the microphone in a conference call with Wall Street analysts and swatted down rumors about the company's problems.
 According to an e-mail message uncovered by securities regulators in their investigation of Wall Street research practices, Mr. Ebbers received a good deal of help with his rousing script from Jack B. Grubman, the telecommunications stock analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
 Stock analysts are supposed to offer investors independent, fair-minded opinions on the health of American companies. But this exchange reveals an unusual level of collaboration between analyst and executive and suggests that Mr. Grubman was anything but impartial about WorldCom. 
It has long been known that Mr. Ebbers and Mr. Grubman were unusually close. Mr. Ebbers relied heavily on the analyst and his firm for financing, merger advice and a strategic view on the telecommunications industry. 
A comparison of the e-mail message's contents, which were obtained from two people briefed on the investigations, with a recording of the WorldCom conference call suggests that Mr. Ebbers relied heavily on Mr. Grubman's advice on that February day. On the call, scheduled to discuss fourth-quarter earnings, Mr. Ebbers walked through the analyst's suggestions on subjects like WorldCom's accounting and its liquidity almost exactly as Mr. Grubman had advised. 
There is nothing illegal about an analyst advising a chief executive how to approach a crucial conference call. But providing such detailed coaching to an executive, as the e-mail message does, is highly unusual for an analyst and seems to indicate that Mr. Grubman considered himself a close adviser to Mr. Ebbers, playing a supporting role to the chief executive that would normally be the task of a corporate insider or public relations specialist. 
"It looks as if Jack was calling all the shots," said Susan Kalla, a telecommunications stock analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey in New York, after having been told about the e-mail message. "The tone of it is a complete reversal of what you would normally see, where the C.E.O. tells the analyst how he conducts the business. The analyst would never be in the position to have the superior knowledge base, ostensibly."
Mr. Grubman, who resigned from the brokerage house in August, did not return phone calls seeking comment on the e-mail message.
Mr. Grubman, who issued a steady stream of bullish reports on WorldCom until just days before it collapsed, has acknowledged that he had an intimate relationship with the company. Testifying before Congress last July, the analyst said that he even attended some WorldCom board meetings.
In spite of his close relationship with the company and its management, Mr. Grubman has said that he had no knowledge of the accounting irregularities that led to WorldCom's collapse. He testified that while his work usually required him to "engage in a serious, active dialogue with the people who make the decisions in order to put S.E.C. filings and audited financials into context," his positive view on WorldCom was based solely on public financial statements prepared by the company's management.
Mr. Grubman sent the e-mail message to Mr. Ebbers at 7:16 p.m. on Feb. 4, 2002; that day WorldCom stock had lost 15.4 percent on the market rumors. He wrote: "Below is list of issues that should be addressed head-on on Thursday's call: 1. Liquidity issues -- should talk about how you guys have no problem meeting maturities. 2. Off-balance sheet stuff. Discuss how securitization of accounts receivable not new and does not impact improving period-to-period free cash flow. 3. Integrity of accounting -- big issue. Investors will worry that some bombshell will come out in the 10K," an extensive annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
"People want to know that what you see is what you get," he added.
Also on Mr. Grubman's list was a discussion of Mr. Ebbers's rapidly growing loan from WorldCom, which totaled $375 million at that point. The loan, backed by WorldCom shares, was becoming a headache for Mr. Ebbers because as the company's stock plummeted, the value of his shares was falling far below his borrowings. Investors were also growing concerned that Mr. Ebbers might be forced to sell his enormous stake, further depressing WorldCom's stock.
After identifying two other areas of concern that he thought Mr. Ebbers should tackle on the call, Mr. Grubman wrote: "Give me a call if you want to follow up. Hang in there." Then Mr. Grubman wrote Mr. Ebbers again, emphasizing the need to confront growing questions about WorldCom's accounting.
Shortly after sending Mr. Ebbers the e-mail list, Mr. Grubman published a research note on WorldCom, reiterating his strong buy recommendation. Noting that WorldCom's stock had been "unduly punished" by investors fretting about accounting and balance sheet issues, Mr. Grubman concluded, referring to WorldCom by its stock symbol at the time: "We feel quite confident that investors will see on Thursday (Feb. 7) morning that Mr. Ebbers is very engaged in the business and that he feels 1,000 percent that WCOM is executing better than in any time over the past 10 years. Also, despite any issues he may be personally facing, we believe he is quite on top of the tactical, financial and strategic challenges facing the company."
Only Mr. Ebbers knows, of course, whether he took Mr. Grubman's e-mail advice. He resigned under pressure last year. Mr. Ebbers's lawyer said his client would not comment on the matter. 
But when it came time for the conference call with analysts and investors, Mr. Ebbers followed Mr. Grubman's e-mail script almost to the letter. The stock rose 12.4 percent on that day.
Mr. Ebbers began the call on Feb. 7, 2002, by saying: "I would like to clear the air on the rumor mill, most of which should be classified as unfounded nonsense." Then he proceeded through Mr. Grubman's list.
"First, accounting. Let me be clear we stand by our accounting. But I want to hit these concerns head-on," Mr. Ebbers said. 
Addressing investor concerns about liquidity, the executive said, "We have a solid bill-paying customer base, $10.5 billion in current assets, $39 billion in plant, property and equipment, a solid investment-grade debt rating, and are free cash flow positive ahead of time." He also stressed that WorldCom had no bank debt or commercial paper borrowings and that the company had "a very minimal" amount of debt scheduled to mature during the year. "Bankruptcy or a credit default is not a concern," he said. "To question WorldCom's viability is utter nonsense." About five months later, WorldCom was in bankruptcy court.
On the matter of his loans backed by company stock, Mr. Ebbers assured listeners that he had enough assets other than WorldCom shares to cover the loans. "I hope you know me well enough to know that I take WorldCom's finances very seriously and I take my debt to the company very seriously," he said. 
And echoing Mr. Grubman's research note from Feb. 4, Mr. Ebbers concluded his part of the conference call by saying: "It has been 10 years since WorldCom has been so well positioned from an operating perspective."
Having tackled every item on Mr. Grubman's e-mail list, Mr. Ebbers turned over the microphone to other WorldCom executives who discussed the company's fourth-quarter results and answered questions from analysts.
Some of the analysts seemed concerned that the company's revenue growth had come in below expectations and asked questions about the slowdown. But when Mr. Grubman's turn came to ask a question, he focused on WorldCom's international business, a relatively small part of its operations which had shown strength.
The day after the call, Mr. Grubman published an extensive report on WorldCom's comments and once again recommended the shares. "Perhaps the most significant outcome of WCOM's earnings release was its very clear denial of the unfounded rumors surrounding its liquidity position, balance sheet and accounting," he wrote.

HEADLINE: ONLINE SHOPPER; 
A Slick Carry-On for the Modern Pilgrim

BYLINE:  By Michelle Slatalla; E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I HAVE been getting ready to take a trip to the past, to my grandmother's eastern Kentucky hometown, circa 1935.
 Much of her world is gone. The hospital where she worked as a nurse has been replaced by an empty paved lot. Most of the landmarks on the Main Street she loved, which featured a theater where you could see a matinee for a quarter and weekend dances in a gymnasium where the punch bowl was spiked with moonshine, are boarded up. 
I'm writing a book about her long-lost hometown, so I sit in my resolutely modern office and sift through newspaper clippings that describe in shorthand the events of my grandmother's life: "Miss Mary Mynhier was slightly hurt last Friday morning when the ambulance in which she was riding overturned on the highway near the Martin theater."
 She loved adventures. If she were alive, I would ask her: Was it a great adventure, skidding through little skiffs of snow in the rickety ambulance toward a medical emergency, rushing past the Widow Elam's house and Gardis Dingus's hardware store? Was it thrilling to believe the little town had a limitless future, and so did you, and that they were somehow intertwined?
 It turns out that you can return to the past. Or at least to a version of it. Enough of her world has survived to enable me to answer the questions by traveling to Kentucky next month.
 But as I started last week to plan for the trip, I realized that confronting history would be a lot easier with the aid of modern luggage. My mismatched duffels, oversize uprights and 40-year-old hard-sided orange suitcases weren't going to make my trip any easier.
 I hate to check luggage. So my goal, as I went online to look for a new suitcase, was the simple yet elusive dream of many business travelers. First, I wanted a single carry-on piece (on wheels) that could hold a week's worth of clothing. In addition, I wanted a small, laptop-friendly briefcase kind of a bag that could piggyback snugly onto the wheeled suitcase.
 I pictured a new me. Instead of a sweaty, overburdened traveler carrying heavy, bunchy-looking bags that suggested cargos of wadded dirty laundry, I wanted to move as smartly and coolly through the terminal as a flight attendant or a pilot. Was that too much to ask?
 The Internet is a good place to look because luggage is one of those things that at first glance, in a store, looks confusingly interchangeable. Kind of black and square. With zippers. But at a site like www.luggageonline.com, you can see an efficiently organized universe of luggage.
 The site, which sells more than three dozen brands, had hundreds of little images and descriptions of different models, enabling me to know at a glance which items were made of ballistic nylon and whether they featured one-touch handle systems, recessed ball-bearing wheels or exterior zippered pockets for travel documents.
 But before I could choose, I had one burning question: Which was the biggest size that was guaranteed to pass muster as a carry-on aboard a domestic flight?
 "A 22-inch rollaboard," said Anne DeCicco, president of the Travel Goods Association, a trade group that represents the interests of all phases of luggage, from steamer trunks to clear-plastic add-on compartments and clutch bags that hold cash and an airline ticket.
 Although each airline sets its own rules for carry-ons, most domestic flights have a size limit of 45 linear inches, which translates into a 22-by-14-inch bag on wheels, stuffed full of clothes to a depth of nine inches.
 Sometimes you might be able to get a bigger bag onboard -- if, say, you're traveling on a 757 with roomier overhead compartments -- but don't bet on it.
 "It's enforced gate by gate and airline by airline, based on how full a flight is and how big a plane is," Ms. DeCicco said. "A 737 has much less carry-on space. The MD-80's, also very difficult. I always call ahead to see what kind of plane I'll be on before I pack."
These days, luggage has become very specialized. You can buy see-through cases for toiletries, to allow security checkers to examine all your possessions without actually touching your personal items (some are available at eaglecreek.com) and bags with pockets for electronic equipment and cellphones (like Baggallini's bottom-zip tote bag, $69.99 at ebags.com).
 Most airlines strictly enforce a limit of one carry-on plus one briefcase or purse per passenger, Ms. DeCicco warned.
 I was dreading that moment when I had to decide whether to carry a briefcase (and then lug the heavy thing throughout the trip as if it were a purse, leaving strap marks on my shoulders) or simply a purse (which would leave me with nothing to transport my laptop at my destination). 
 But there is a solution for that, too. Ms. DeCicco recommended as a purse replacement a Hobo International lightweight airport clutch, the size of a ticket folder, which has a zip compartment for cash, slots for a driver's license and credit cards and room for a passport. You slip it inside your briefcase, then carry it as a purse at your destination. At firststreetleather.com, it comes in four colors and costs $59.
 Ms. DeCicco has the enviable luxury of owning several sets of luggage and about 10 different briefcases. Currently, she said, she packs a fashionable Hartmann set of chocolate brown and red-polka dot wool (Hartmann's 22-inch expandable mobile traveler is $695 at classicluggage.com). 
 I, however, will be sharing the luggage with my husband, who might object to pulling a big polka-dotted thing on wheels through the airport.
 I phoned Luggageonline.com. "Which one is the one I always see flight attendants and pilots pulling effortlessly, as if they were walking a well-behaved dog?" I asked.
 "That's the Crew Four collection from Travelpro," the customer service representative said. "They're one of the deepest of all the cases, and that's what you're looking for, overall depth."
 It came in black and in a discreet dark blue. I went to a local luggage store to investigate further. Luggage prices there were identical to those of online sites. The 22-inch rollaboard was clearly the answer; if I packed economically, it probably would hold just enough to get me back to 1935. For a short visit.

HEADLINE: A Memorial, Yes, but Battle Lines Form for Everything Else at Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The easy part of the rebuilding on the World Trade Center site may be over, even if it took nearly 18 months of often fractious public hearings and disputes between rival public and private interests to select a design team for the endeavor.
 It is now clear that there will be a memorial on the southwest part of the site, which embraces the footprints of the twin towers. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is well along in building a temporary PATH station that will restore rail service to New Jersey and in planning a permanent transit hub. Billions of dollars have been set aside for the transit hub and an underground concourse stretching from the World Financial Center, across the trade center site to the subways at Broadway and Fulton Street. 
 But battle lines are already being drawn over most everything else, from the proposed underground parking garages to an enclosed mall and the amount of commercial office space. It is by no means certain how the memorial will be paid for, when the commercial buildings will go up, whether the towers will look anything like the designs being unveiled at a news conference today or who in the end will control the trade center site, the city or the Port Authority.
Most people agree that with acres of vacant office space available in Lower Manhattan and layoffs continuing on Wall Street, it will be years before there is any demand for new commercial buildings. Still, the Port Authority, which owns the land, wants to be able to rebuild the 10 million square feet of office space and the huge concourse mall that once occupied the site. It wants to ensure that it continues to get about $120 million a year in rent, asit does under its lease with the developer Larry A. Silverstein.
In the last few weeks the architects have been asked to accommodate some of these demands. But members of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation like Roland W. Betts, some civic groups and others fear that the current designs could essentially be scrapped by compromises in the near future.
"The physical wreckage has been cleared from the site but the legal and institutional piles are still strewn across the landscape," said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association and a leader of the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York. "The real challenge moving forward is to safeguard the integrity of the designs, to make sure that they're not whittled away by conflicts over parking garages, a shopping mall or financial concerns."
But one director of the development corporation expressed a starkly different view. "None of this stuff is written in stone," he said, echoing comments by two downtown developers and several state officials.
But those are not the only issues.
There is debate over the future of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which was created by the governor and the mayor to lead the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. Many state officials say that the corporation should now narrow its focus to an international design contest for the memorial and cut its staff.
But Mr. Betts, some city officials and the civic groups want the corporation to play a strong role in ensuring the integrity of the design, which was fashioned in a public process, rather than allowing any plan to be compromised beyond recognition by the commercial interests of the Port Authority or the developer.
Both sides seem to agree that the $1.3 billion left in the corporation should go to transportation and road projects downtown, not to, say, the memorial or other architectural plans. A director of the corporation suggested that the memorial could be supported by a fund-raising effort, rather by than federal money designated for rebuilding downtown, and Mr. Betts, who is a close friend of President Bush, has hinted that some federal money might be available from the White House.
"Hopefully the money will go towards transportation," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and vice chairman of the Port Authority. "The more we fund the infrastructure projects, the better off the future of Lower Manhattan."
There is also a question about who will ultimately control the site.
The Bloomberg administration has proposed a land swap, giving the Port Authority the land beneath the airports in exchange for the trade center site. But Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, also wants $890 million for the airport land, as well as some continuing control over airport operations. The Port Authority, in turn, has offered $500 million and may go to $600 million, according to two people who have been briefed on the negotiations. But many officials doubt that a deal will be made.
"It's a game," said one Port Authority executive. "It's very difficult to work out and I don't think it's going to happen."
In the meantime, the land is owned by the Port Authority, which leased the twin towers to Mr. Silverstein six weeks before the terrorist attack in a 99-year deal valued at $3.2 billion. Mr. Silverstein's partner, Westfield America, leased the concourse mall, one of the most lucrative in the country because of the 50,000 visitors and workers who flowed through the complex every day. Westfield and Mr. Silverstein still pay a combined $10 million a month in rent.
Mr. Silverstein insists that under the terms of the lease he has the obligation and the right to rebuild 10 million square feet of office space. Nor does he feel bound by the designs or compelled to use their architects. "He's willing to work with people," said one person who works with Mr. Silverstein, "but the developer will decide everything about the design. We're the ones who have to rent these buildings."
Westfield, a suburban mall operator, has said that it has the right to rebuild the underground mall to a total of 900,000 square feet, twice what was there originally. The Port Authority has also insisted that a bus garage go underneath the site.
But the Bloomberg administration, many urban planners and downtown residents complain that a vast underground mall would rob the area of street life. They favor ground-floor retail in the office buildings and vibrant retail corridors along Broadway and Fulton Street, with fewer stores underground.
These disputes are why Mr. Yaro and others fear that all the work on the design may be meaningless if the Port Authority and others are allowed to override them.
"There's a real concern that the Port will wrap an underground mall, millions of square feet of office space and a bunch of parking garages around this great new civic and memorial space," Mr. Yaro said. "It's the worst kind of 1960's planning."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: New Products Needed, Executive Says 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Thomas J. Engibous, the chief executive of Texas Instruments, said yesterday that electronics makers needed to create new products to spur consumer interest and revive sales. "We're in a lull in that regard right now," Mr. 
Engibous said at an investment conference in La Quinta, Calif. Analog modems and personal computers that can run audio and video applications have increased orders for electronics components in the past, he said. Slack consumer demand has been heightened by concern about a possible war in Iraq, which he said had put corporate spending into a holding pattern. Texas Instruments, the world's biggest maker of chips for cellphones, will have sales this quarter about equal to the fourth quarter's $2.15 billion, he said, confirming a previous forecast.

HEADLINE: Colored Stones Light a Fire in Jewelry Sales 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
At Ralph Lauren's show two weeks ago, an impossibly slim model, wearing a white satin evening gown that would have made Jean Harlow proud, strode down the runway wearing something just as stunning: a bold, chunky, showy necklace made of dozens of crystal quartz beads, wrapped around and around and around her narrow neck.
 The necklace, and similar ones worn at this season's couture shows, represents a trend that jewelers are hoping will bail them out in the current listless market: "fashion jewelry" made from semiprecious stones like amethyst and moonstone and seldom-used minerals like chalcedony, chrysoprase and amazonite. Sometimes the colored stones are gigantic rocks, sometimes they are tiny stones formed into more elaborate shapes like hearts and starfish in a style called pave. 
 The stones themselves may be inexpensive -- a necklace-long string of turquoise beads sells for $15 at a jewelry trade show -- but the designs are not cheap. At merchants like Bergdorf Goodman and Barneys, elaborate bangles and beads sell for $1,500 and up. At Bergdorf, an Angela Cummings necklace of three-quarter-inch polished chunks in the softest baby-blue chalcedony ("it's a mineral," said the sales clerk, brightly) is priced at $13,500. A Cummings diamond pave flower pin goes for $22,500. 
These chunky bohemian beadings and the more elegant pave brooches and pendants make up an increasing share of what is selling now, jewelry designers and dealers say. Martin Rapaport, publisher of The Rapaport Diamond Report, said that colored stones -- particularly pink sapphires, citrines and coral -- were selling strongly.
At the same time, the market for the best diamonds is in a slump, some dealers said. Mr. Rapaport said the price of high-quality polished diamonds had dropped 5 to 7 percent since the beginning of 2002.
While there are still those for whom the large diamond solitaire is the ultimate status symbol, dealers say the word in the jewelry business right now is big and bold -- and relatively cheap.
"What's happening in the jewelry business is that the customers want to look like they're trading up -- but they're trading down," said Marshal Cohen, of NPD Fashionworld, a research company. "They want opulence for as little money as possible."
For the designers and retailers, fashion jewelry has other obvious advantages. "The profit margins are much bigger," said Clive Kandel, whose jewelry is on display at his boutique in Bergdorf Goodman. 
"Right now the serious jewelry business is in a major recession," Mr. Kandel said. "In the 80's, people bought diamonds from Cartier; in the 90's, they bought gold and diamond Rolexes. Now that business has dried up, and people are spending smaller amounts on jewelry that may look like a lot. There's a whole new area of artisan jewelry that is different from traditional jewelry, made from ready-made components from India and Thailand."
Albert Kassab, who sells elaborately made, very bold -- some might say gaudy -- rings and things from his booth at 15 West 47th Street in Manhattan, said that only five years ago, precious gems made up 90 percent of his business. Now it is 40 percent. He produced a cognac-colored Brazilian citrine the size of a quarter, surrounded by yellow sapphires and diamonds, set in 18-karat gold. The asking price was $3,500. 
Nearby, Robert Knupfer of KIG International, which supplies many of these large colored stones to the trade, said the biggest, boldest pieces "aren't costume, they're serious jewelry, natural stones."
For today's wealthy, Mr. Knupfer said, "their portfolio might be smaller, but their jewelry is bigger."
While most dealers and collectors say that the really fine diamonds or rubies or emeralds -- the three precious gemstones -- will hold their value, they contend that semiprecious stones will not. "People walk out of the stores thinking they're making an investment," Mr. Kandel said, "but these things are for fashion only -- ask anybody at Sotheby's; they have no value whatsoever."
At Sotheby's, Lisa Hubbard, vice president in charge of international jewelry sales, said necklaces, brooches and bracelets by the hottest designers might fetch, on average, one-third or one-quarter of what the customer pays. But both Ms. Hubbard and the head of jewelry at Christie's, Simon Teakle, said that no one could pick which fashionjewelry pieces would be "rediscovered" in the future -- and stage a comeback.
"Look at the tutti-frutti jewelry that came from Cartier's in the 1920's," said Ms. Hubbard, referring to the multicolored bead jewelry that was the rage 80 years ago. "That wasn't made of the finest diamonds or rubies or emeralds -- but now it is very collectible." 
A period tutti-frutti brooch was for sale on Monday at M. Khordipour, an antique jewelry shop on West 47th Street, for $18,000. "But it took 80 years," Ms. Hubbard added.
Not everyone agrees, of course, that most of today's jewelry has the trade-in value of, say, a new car. Some designers like Stephen Dweck, who sold $6 million of his chunky jewelry in Nieman Marcus alone last year, argue that anyone can put beads together, just like anyone can dream up a dress, buy a pattern and whip it up. But it will not have the style, the artistry, of a Balenciaga -- or a Dweck.
"My pieces are in the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute and in the Smithsonian in Washington," Mr. Dweck said. While acknowledging that some of the jewelry made of semiprecious stones was "junk," he said his was different. "I've got the first pick of what comes out of the mountain," he said. "And if I find something great, I buy all of it, and let it out gradually, like over 20 years, so it's still very rare."
At Mr. Dweck's factory in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, women sat in a warehouse expanse, stringing carved coral beads, fitting and polishing sterling silver castings with tiny balls around the edges, gluing in faceted semiprecious stones; in smaller rooms nearby, men with visors worked at grinding wheels. Mr. Dweck and his family direct a staff of 102 men and women. Unlike many other designers of the New Wave chunky jewelry, Mr. Dweck assembles his jewelry in the United States.
"We tried having things made in other countries, but we couldn't control the quality," said Edmund Dweck, the president and Mr. Dweck's brother.
One bracelet spotted in the Brooklyn factory represents cutting-edge style in modern jewelry. It was made of sterling silver ($4.80 an ounce), chunks of white quartz with strips of green tourmaline running through them ($50 to $75 retail, estimated), and two faceted moonstones ($150 to $200 retail, estimated). It also bears Mr. Dweck's signature tiny silver beetle, meaning that it is one of a kind. Edmund Dweck said the piece was destined for Bergdorf, where he said it would sell for $3,500.
For many customers, the jewelry is not about investment. Merchants say their customers are buying the beaded confections because they are stunning, they are relatively cheap and they make a splash.
Ed Burstell, general manager of Henri Bendel, a high-end store in Manhattan, said shoppers -- caught in an uncertain economy -- were "looking for a feel-good item" to give pizazz to a basic black dress or a T-shirt. Two weeks ago, Bendel took the beaded necklace trend to its ultimate conclusion: the store is introducing Femmegems, a make-it-yourself jewelry booth on the second floor, near the elevator. Femmegems features little trays of pink quartz, labradorite (a luminescent blue-green stone), amethysts, coral and other beads. For $58 to $650, the store lets the budding designers pick out exactly what they want, and watch a jewelry maker string it together for them.
Mr. Burstell said the new counter was already a hit; one industry expert said the store was grossing $10,000 to $15,000 a week from it. "From the very first day we put it out, they've been grabbing, and trying on, and really embracing the concept," Mr. Burstell said. "Down deep, I guess everyone really does fancy they're a designer."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE MIDDLE EAST; 
Israel Says War on Iraq Would Benefit The Region

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Israelis once believed that the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians would usher in a new Middle East of comfortable Israeli-Arab coexistence.
 With Oslo in tatters, the Israelis are now putting similar hopes in an American war on Iraq. 
 Other nations may cavil, but many in Israel are so certain of the rightness of a war on Iraq that officials are already thinking past that conflict to urge a continued, assertive American role in the Middle East.
Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz told members of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations last week that after Iraq, the United States should generate "political, economic, diplomatic pressure" on Iran. "We have great interest in shaping the Middle East the day after" a war, he said. 
It may seem paradoxical that the country most vulnerable to an Iraqi attack in case of war is most eager for that war to begin.
But Israel's military intelligence apparatus has concluded that the chances of a successful Iraqi missile strike here during this war, while ever present, are small.
The Israeli government and military elite believe that Saddam Hussein seeks devastating weapons but has far less capacity for mayhem than he had during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, when his forces fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. The Israeli Army also believes that its own national defenses are much improved.
Israel regards Iran and Syria as greater threats and is hoping that once Saddam Hussein is dispensed with, the dominoes will start to tumble. According to this hope -- or evolving strategy -- moderates and reformers throughout the region would be encouraged to put new pressure on their own governments, not excepting the Palestine Authority of Yasir Arafat.
"The shock waves emerging from post-Saddam Baghdad could have wide-ranging effects in Tehran, Damascus, and in Ramallah," Efraim Halevy, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's national security adviser, said in a speech in Munich this month.
Until recently, Mr. Halevy was the chief of the Mossad, Israel's spy agency. He said, "We have hopes of greater stability, greater enhanced confidence from the Persian Gulf to the Atlantic shores of Morocco."
Israelis have also suggested that that an Iraq war may salvage their economy and even prompt the opposition Labor Party to join Mr. Sharon's coalition in a new government of national unity.
Expressed in its broadest, vaguest terms, that theory has come in for the sort of mockery that the idealistic vision of Oslo's effects suffered from the right. The accusation is the same: fuzzy, wishful thinking.
Uzi Benziman, a journalist and author of a biography of Mr. Sharon, wrote in the newspaper Haaretz, "Israel is looking for Ares, the ancient Greek god of war, to play the part of the deus ex machina in this drama."
Referring to this "almost pagan faith," he continued, "It's still hard to shake the feeling that what the fervency of Israeli expectations regarding the war really attests to is despair." Opinion polls here have shown a strong though not overwhelming majority in favor of war.
The precise mechanism for converting a war into regional stability has not been detailed.
Mark Heller, a senior researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, said the potential engine for change would be the example of a transformed Iraq.
"It's at least conceivable that Al Jazeera will end up showing pictures of Iraqis celebrating in the streets, in which case people in other places -- like Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt -- are going to start saying, 'If Iraqis deserve decent government, so do we.' " Al Jazeera is a widely watched Arab broadcast network.
Israeli officials say that only sustained American pressure can turn that hope into reality. Mr. Mofaz warned that without continued attention to the rest of the region, an Iraqi collapse could strengthen Iran.
As they look ahead to the aftermath of an Iraq war, Israeli officials are also considering how the Bush administration's present diplomatic struggle could help or hurt them. A top Israeli official predicted that after such a war would come a fork in the road for American policy and "a battle for the heart and mind" of President Bush.
The official said the Bush administration might try to mend relations with Arab and European nations by wringing concessions from Israel toward the Palestinians.
But he said it was more likely that rising American frustration with Europe would benefit Israel. Mr. Sharon has been alarmed by the recent efforts of the so-called quartet -- the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- to intervene in the conflict here. Mr. Sharon would much prefer to deal only with the United States.
The top Israeli official said the quartet might prove a "casualty" of an Iraqi war. "The idea of using the quartet as the great instrument of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- there are people in Washington who are going to say, 'What do we need these people for?' " he said.

HEADLINE: Strategists See Victory in Stalemate 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
President Bush and his fellow Republicans complain about Miguel Estrada's treatment at the hands of Senate Democrats, but some also see a political advantage for their party in the continuing fight over his nomination to an important appeals court.
 Party strategists say they believe that determined Democratic resistance to a nominee of Hispanic heritage would help Republicans make inroads with a voting bloc crucial to their hold on power. And if the Honduran-born Mr. Estrada is confirmed, so much the better, these strategists say, putting Republicans in what a top Senate aide called a "win-win situation." 
 "I would say Republicans are on the high ground on Miguel Estrada," Senator George Allen of Virginia, chairman of National Republican Senatorial Committee, said this week as Democrats continued to oppose a vote on President Bush's nomination of Mr. Estrada to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. "I surely think it will help us with Hispanic voters."
Mr. Bush, who on Saturday devoted his national radio address to Mr. Estrada, a Washington lawyer, stoked the flames again today, telling a group of Hispanic businesspeople who are backing Mr. Estrada that Democratic refusal to allow a vote was a "travesty, an injustice, being carried out by those responsible for helping to uphold justice in this country."
Democrats counter that their Hispanic supporters back them in the push to force Mr. Estrada to disclose more of his own views on important judicial issues before they allow a vote. They say Senate Republicans are keeping the issue on the floor because they have no legislation ready to offer. And they say it is typical of the Bush administration to promote a single conservative judicial candidate as representative of its stance on Hispanic issues rather than to offer more meaningful policy proposals.
"That is the Republican strategy when it comes to minorities," said Representative Charlie Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, a former judge who is in the forefront of opposition to Mr. Estrada by the all-Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus. "Form over substance."
The battle has divided Hispanic groups and led to advertising campaigns in a preview of the struggle for the allegiance of Hispanic voters in the 2004 election.
A coalition of liberal groups opposed to Mr. Estrada began running an advertisement this week suggesting that he is "stonewalling the public and the Senate." The advertisement was an effort to counter pro-Estrada advertisements by Republican and Hispanic groups. Those advocates, seeking to pressure individual Democratic senators into breaking with their party, have run advertisements in select states including Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana and North Carolina, with one spot accusing Democrats of "intolerance."
Mr. Estrada's supporters picked up one new Democrat on Tuesday as Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a state with a substantial Hispanic population, said he would vote for confirmation. Mr. Nelson is the fourth Democrat to back Mr. Estrada, leaving the 51 Republicans short of the 60 votes they would need to end the stalemate. Democrats say their remaining 44 votes are solid.
Republicans said they are not ready to try to force action, saying it would set a bad precedent by establishing a 60-vote threshold for judicial nominees. "Even though we would then use that action against a Democratic president's nominees, we don't think that is the best policy," said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. Mr. Kyl and other Republicans say they would prefer to keep the debate going in the hope of eventually getting a straight up or down vote they know they would win. They kept the Senate meeting late tonight to make recalcitrant Democrats pay a price for the fight.
Members of both parties say it is unclear whether the nomination fight would aid Republicans and Mr. Bush, who has made courting Hispanic voters a central element of his political strategy. But Bush allies like their chances. "It never hurts a Republican president to be seen battling on the side of talented Latinos getting jobs in his administration," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster.
The national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a major Hispanic membership organization that has endorsed Mr. Estrada, said he believes Hispanic voters are paying attention.
"I would be surprised if those that are engaged with this debate are not disappointed with the Democratic Party for not giving this nominee a chance to be confirmed," the director, Brent Wilkes, said. He said similar "diversity" issues have drawn traditionally Democratic Hispanic voters to Republicans in recent elections in New York and Texas.
Sergio Bendixen, a veteran Hispanic pollster in Miami who was at first uncertain what impact the issue would have on Latino voters, said he had seen an escalation of the coverage in Spanish-language news media and that Republicans might be scoring points.
Reinforcing his impression about news coverage, Cuban-American House members from Florida who joined Republican senators at a press conference this week to criticize Democrats slipped into Spanish to conclude their remarks to get their message more easily onto the Spanish-language networks.
Other analysts said the fight had been distorted by both sides and that Hispanics were much more likely to cast their ballots on bread and butter issues like the economy and immigration.
"It is certainly not one of those issues that I think will move Hispanic voters in the heat of an election," said Adam J. Segal, director of the Hispanic Voter Project at Johns Hopkins University.
Some Democrats say they had no choice but to block Mr. Estrada's nomination, that if he succeeds in refusing to answer questions about his views all future Bush judicial nominees would adopt the same posture. Lawmakers say the administration craftily chose a minority candidate to try the tactic since it would be riskier for Democrats to object. Democrats say a simple decision by Mr. Estrada to provide more background could break the deadlock. 
In their floor speeches, Democrats also point out that Republicans employed similar stalling tactics against Clinton administration nominees, including Hispanic judicial candidates. "I think that the longer people look at the arguments, the more we have merit," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has been a leader of the opposition to Mr. Estrada. 
While each party talks about judicial qualifications, each also keeps a political watch on its base. Republicans emphasize that their effort will probably play well with conservative groups, and Democrats say they could benefit by energizing core voters who believe the party has not been aggressive enough in standing up to Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
In the President's Words: 'Free People Will Keep the Peace of the World'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the speech given yesterday by President Bush to the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, as recorded by The New York Times:
 We meet here during a crucial period in the history of our nation and of the civilized world. Part of that history was written by others; the rest will be written by us. 
 On a September morning, threats that had gathered for years in secret and far away led to murder in our country on a massive scale. As a result, we must look at security in a new way, because our country is a battlefield in the first war of the 21st century. 
We learned a lesson: the dangers of our time must be confronted actively and forcefully before we see them again in our skies and in our cities. And we set a goal: we will not allow the triumph of hatred and violence in the affairs of men.
Our coalition of more than 90 countries is pursuing the networks of terror with every tool of law enforcement and with military power. We have arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of Al Qaeda. Across the world, we are hunting down the killers one by one. We are winning, and we're showing them the definition of American justice. And we are opposing the greatest danger in the war on terror -- outlaw regimes arming with weapons of mass destruction. 
In Iraq, a dictator is building and hiding weapons that could enable him to dominate the Middle East and intimidate the civilized world, and we will not allow it. This same tyrant has close ties to terrorist organizations and could supply them with the terrible means to strike this country, and America will not permit it.
The danger posed by Saddam Hussein and his weapons cannot be ignored or wished away. The danger must be confronted. We hope that the Iraqi regime will meet the demands of the United Nations and disarm fully and peacefully. If it does not, we are prepared to disarm Iraq by force. Either way, this danger will be removed.
The safety of the American people depends on ending this direct and growing threat. Acting against the danger will also contribute greatly to the long-term safety and stability of our world. The current Iraqi regime has shown the power of tyranny to spread discord and violence in the Middle East. A liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to transform that vital region by bringing hope and progress into the lives of millions. America's interest in security and America's belief in liberty both lead in the same direction -- to a free and peaceful Iraq.
The first to benefit from a free Iraq would be the Iraqi people themselves. Today they live in scarcity and fear under a dictator who has brought them nothing but war and misery and torture. Their lives and their freedom matter little to Saddam Hussein. But Iraqi lives and freedom matter greatly to us. 
Bringing stability and unity to a free Iraq will not be easy. Yet that is no excuse to leave the Iraqi regime's torture chambers and poison labs in operation. Any future the Iraqi people choose for themselves will be better than the nightmare world that Saddam Hussein has chosen for them. 
If we must use force, the United States and our coalition stand ready to help the citizens of a liberated Iraq. We will deliver medicine to the sick. And we are now moving into place nearly three million emergency rations to feed the hungry. We will make sure that Iraq's 55,000 food distribution sites, operating under the oil-for-food program, are stocked and open as soon as possible. The United States and Great Britain are providing tens of millions of dollars to the U.N. High Commission on Refugees and to such groups as the World Food Program and Unicef to provide emergency aid to the Iraqi people.
We will alsolead in carrying out the urgent and dangerous work of destroying chemical and biological weapons. We will provide security against those who try to spread chaos or settle scores or threaten the territorial integrity of Iraq. We will seek to protect Iraq's natural resources from sabotage by a dying regime, and ensure those resources are used for the benefit of the owners: the Iraqi people.
The United States has no intention of determining the precise form of Iraq's new government. That choice belongs to the Iraqi people. Yet we will ensure that one brutal dictator is not replaced by another. All Iraqis must have a voice in the new government, and all citizens must have their rights protected.
Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from many nations, including our own. We will remain in Iraq as long as necessary and not a day more. America has made and kept this kind of commitment before in the peace that followed a world war. After defeating enemies, we did not leave behind occupying armies, we left constitutions and parliaments. We established an atmosphere of safety in which responsible, reform-minded local leaders could build lasting institutions of freedom. In societies that once bred fascism and militarism, liberty found a permanent home.
There was a time when many said that the cultures of Japan and Germany were incapable of sustaining democratic values. Well, they were wrong. Some say the same of Iraq today. They are mistaken. The nation of Iraq, with its proud heritage, abundant resources and skilled and educated people is fully capable of moving toward democracy and living in freedom. 
The world has a clear interest in the spread of democratic values, because stable and free nations do not breed the ideologies of murder. They encourage the peaceful pursuit of a better life. And there are hopeful signs of the desire for freedom in the Middle East. Arab intellectuals have called on Arab governments to address the freedom gap so their peoples can fully share in the progress of our times. Leaders in the region speak of a new Arab charter that champions internal reform, greater political participation, economic openness and free trade. And from Morocco to Bahrain and beyond, nations are taking genuine steps toward political reform. A new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations in the region.
It is presumptuous and insulting to suggest that a whole region of the world or the one-fifth of humanity that is Muslim is somehow untouched by the most basic aspirations of life. Human cultures can be vastly different, yet the human heart desires the same good things everywhere on earth. In our desire to be safe from brutal and bullying oppression, human beings are the same. In our desire to care for our children and give them a better life, we're the same. For these fundamental reasons, freedom and democracy will always and everywhere have greater appeal than the slogans of hatred and the tactics of terror.
Success in Iraq could also begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace and set in motion progress towards a truly democratic Palestinian state. The passing of Saddam Hussein's regime will deprive terrorist networks of a wealthy patron that pays for terrorist training and offers rewards to families of suicide bombers.
And other regimes will be given a clear warning that support for terror will not be tolerated. Without this outside support for terrorism, Palestinians who are working for reform and long for democracy will be in a better position to choose new leaders --true leaders who strive for peace, true leaders who faithfully serve the people. A Palestinian state must be a reformed and peaceful state that abandons forever the use of terror.
For its part the new government of Israel, as the terror threat is removed and security improves, will be expected to support the creation of a viable Palestinian state and to work as quickly as possible toward a final status agreement. As progress is made toward peace, settlement activity in the occupied territories must end.
And the Arab states will be expected to meet their responsibilities to oppose terrorism, to support the emergence of a peaceful and democratic Palestine, and state clearly they will live in peace with Israel.
The United States and other nations are working on a road map for peace. We are setting out the necessary conditions for progress toward the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. It is the commitment of our government and my personal commitment to implement the road map and to reach that goal. Old patterns of conflict in the Middle East can be broken if all concerned will let go of bitterness and hatred and violence and get on with the serious work of economic development and political reform and reconciliation. America will seize every opportunity in pursuit of peace, and the end of the present regime in Iraq would create such an opportunity. 
In confronting Iraq, the United States is also showing our commitment to effective international institutions. We're a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. We helped to create the Security Council. 
We believe in the Security Council so much that we want its words to have meaning. The global threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction cannot be confronted by one nation alone. The world needs today, and will need tomorrow, international bodies with the authority and the will to stop the spread of terror and chemical and biological and nuclear weapons. A threat to all must be answered by all. High-minded pronouncements against proliferation mean little unless the strongest nations are willing to stand behind them and use force if necessary. After all, the United Nations was created, as Winston Churchill said, to make sure that the force of right will in the ultimate issue be protected by the right of force.
Another resolution is now before the Security Council. If the Council responds to Iraq's defiance with more excuses and delays, if all its authority proves to be empty, the United Nations will be severely weakened as a source of stability and order. If the members rise to this moment, then the Council will fulfill its founding purpose.
I've listened carefully as people and leaders around the world have made known their desire for peace. All of us want peace. The threat to peace does not come from those who seek to enforce the just demands of the civilized world. The threat to peace comes from those who flout those demands. If we have to act, we will act to restrain the violent and defend the cause of peace. And by acting we will signal to outlaw regimes that in this new century the boundaries of civilized behavior will be respected. 
Protecting those boundaries carries a cost. If war is forced upon us by Iraq's refusal to disarm, we will meet an enemy who hides his military forces behind civilians, who has terrible weapons, who is capable of any crime. These dangers are real, as our soldiers and sailors, airmen and marines fully understand. Yet no military has ever been better prepared to meet these challenges. 
Members of our armed forces also understand why they may be called to fight. They know that retreat before a dictator guarantees even greater sacrifices in the future. They know that America's cause is right and just: the liberty for an oppressed people and security for the American people. 
And I know something about these men and women who wear our uniform. They will complete every mission they are given with skill and honor and courage.
Much is asked of America in this year 2003. The work ahead is demanding. It will be difficult to help freedom take hold in a country that has known three decades of dictatorship, secret police, internal divisions and war. It'll be difficult to cultivate liberty and peace in the Middle East after so many generations of strife, yet the security of our nation and the hope of millions depend on us. And Americans do not turn away from duties because they are hard. We have met great tests in other times and we will meet the tests of our time.
We go forward with confidence because we trust in the power of human freedom to change lives and nations. By the resolve and purpose of America and of our friends and allies, we will make this an age of progress and liberty. Free people will set the course of history and free people will keep the peace of the world.
Thank you all very much.

HEADLINE: Senator Named to Delaware River Authority 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Gov. James E. McGreevey today named a Republican state senator, John J. Matheussen, to lead the Delaware River Port Authority, removing a popular Republican from the evenly divided Senate. 
 Senator Matheussen's district in South Jersey has become an increasingly Democratic area, and could be closely contested in the legislative elections this year as both parties focus on taking control of the Senate. The State Assembly is comfortably controlled by the Democrats. 
 Nonetheless, Republicans expect to replace Mr. Matheussen with another well-known legislator, George F. Geist, a six-term Assembly member who was the top vote-getter among the four candidates who ran for the district's two Assembly seats in 2001.
If Mr. McGreevey's recommendation is accepted by the Port Authority board, Mr. Matheussen will become the chief executive of the bistate authority. By tradition, the governor of New Jersey appoints the chief executive and the governor of Pennsylvania chooses the chairman of the 16-member board. Last week, Pennsylvania's new governor, Edward G. Rendell, named himself chairman.
The authority controls bridges, commuter lines and ferries linking New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and it oversees port and economic development projects that involve millions of dollars in contracts. 
Mr. Matheussen, 50, a lawyer, was elected to the Senate in 1992. Last spring, he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate.
Mr. Geist's margin of victory in the legislative district, which includes parts of Camden and Gloucester Counties, was smaller than Mr. Matheussen's in the last election, but the two have run successfully as a team from their first legislative races.
If Mr. Matheussen is approved by the authority and resigns from the Senate, which now has 20 members of each party, his replacement will be chosen by the district's Republican county committees and will then run in the June 3 primary. All members of the Legislature are up for re-election this year. 
Gail Peterson, the Republican chairwoman in Camden County, said today, "I think everybody will come together to unite behind Assemblyman Geist."
Mr. Geist, 47, also a lawyer, said that he was "honored and excited" that party officials were encouraging him to seek the Senate seat but that he could not comment further.

HEADLINE: Labor Secretary's Talk Angers Union Leaders 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Fla., Feb 26 

 BODY:
Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao ignited a furor today among labor leaders, including the administration's strongest friend in labor, the teamster president James P. Hoffa, when she cited repeated examples of union corruption while addressing the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s winter meeting. 
 Mr. Hoffa criticized Secretary Chao and said labor should back a presidential candidate who understands working people, causing many union leaders to say Mr. Hoffa was distancing himself from the president. 
Mr. Hoffa complained that the Bush administration was veering further to the right, and one of his top aides said the secretary's remarks were only the latest of several antilabor actions committed by the administration. 
Secretary Chao stunned more than 100 labor leaders when, in a response to a question about greater financial disclosure, she read aloud for several minutes about seven criminal cases involving officials from the machinists' union. She brought to the meeting a dossier detailing union-related crimes and she read from it after Thomas Buffenbarger, the machinists' president, asked her why the Bush administration was proposing far stricter financial disclosure rules for labor unions.
"It seemed like a clear attempt at intimidation," said Bruce Raynor, president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. "A lot of people were already feeling angry at the Bush administration, and what she said made things a lot worse."
After Ms. Chao left the meeting, Mr. Hoffa -- whom Mr. Bush once invited into the first lady's box during a State of the Union address -- joined several others in voicing bitterness with the administration.
The meeting was closed to the news media, and Teamster officials said Mr. Hoffa, who was on a plane, was unavailable to expand on his comments. But Mike Mathis, the Teamsters' political director, said Mr. Hoffa was highly critical of the administration today and had grown increasingly exasperated with moves he views as antiworker, including proposing to open the border to Mexican trucks and tax cuts that give more to the rich.
Mr. Mathis said Mr. Hoffa told the labor leaders: "We worked very hard to develop a relationship with this administration and we have. But especially since the election last November we have seen this administration veer to the right and try to move issues that are antilabor."
Mr. Hoffa added, Mr. Mathis said: "We're disappointed frankly that they don't understand labor issues and labor people. The way the secretary presented herself today was proof of that. We think it's important that the labor movement strengthen its resolve as we go into 2004 to elect a president who understands working people."
Mr. Mathis said Mr. Hoffa, whose union represents 1.4 million workers, had not ruled out backing Mr. Bush. But he added: "The fact is Jim is disappointed with the direction of the administration. Bush has veered to the right since the election, and if he veers back on track, that will change things. But if Bush is not going to do that, we're going to try very hard to beat him. If there's a better Democratic candidate then that's who the Teamsters will support." 
Speaking about Mr. Hoffa, Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America, said: "He said that Secretary Chao's remarks just give us more reason to turn this administration out in 2004. That reflects everybody's attitude here."
At her own news conference after her speech, Ms. Chao defended the administration's labor record, but acknowledged there were some strains with union leaders.
"It's never easy," she said. "I pride myself on keeping an open door and good communications channels."
She added, "We want to work with those who want to work with us."
Ms. Chao said that Mr. Bush's policies were good for American workers, saying that his economic plan would create 1.4 million jobs. 
Several labor leaders said they were irritated by what they described as the secretary's confrontational tone. They said they were also upset that she said the economy was too weak to raise the federal minimum wage and declined to say much about an administration study that might reduce the number of workers who qualify for overtime pay. 
John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 13 million union members, said Ms. Chao's remarks were insulting.
"I have never seen a secretary of labor who is so antilabor," Mr. Sweeney said at a news conference. "It's fair to say what we saw from the secretary of labor strengthened our beliefs that this administration is antiworker."
Kathleen Harrington, a labor department spokeswoman, said: "She was not insulting. She was not aggressive. She stood up for what she believed."
For months, labor's dismay with the Bush administration has been growing, but at the three-day meeting here, this dismay seemed to explode into bitterness and anger, with the labor federation vowing to do its utmost to defeat Mr. Bush in next year's elections.
Labor leaders have been angered by many administration actions, including its backing the repeal of a new ergonomics law and its stripping 60,000 airport screeners of the right to join a union.
Mr. Buffenbarger, the machinists' president, said he was taken aback when Ms. Chao, in responding to his question, read details of seven cases of financial malfeasance by officials from his union. 
"I felt a little appalled that a labor secretary would come to the meeting prepared to attack the labor movement," he said. "She came prepared with her book of sins. It's like Satan at the gates of hell."
Mr. Buffenbarger pointed out that the union's own audits and internal investigations led to the criminal cases against the machinist officials.
Labor Department officials acknowledged today that Ms. Chao had a dossier describing crimes committed by officials in many of the 65 unions that are part of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Department officials said the dossier helped buttress the administration's case to require greater financial disclosure by unions. Under the proposed regulations, unions would have to detail how much money they spend each year on politics, lobbying, organizing and strike benefits and would have to itemize all expenditures above either a $2,000 or $5,000 threshold.
Responding to labor's criticisms, Ms. Chao said: "As we talk about transparency and corporate malfeasance, organized labor has been in the forefront of asking for transparency. I would think that transparency is an issue they'd want to talk about in their own organizations as well."
Ms. Chao said the tighter regulations would deter malfeasance by union officials, but union leaders said existing disclosure regulations already do that.
She said they would impose only a small burden, perhaps requiring only 50 hours for a union to complete.
Many union leaders view the proposed regulations as retaliatory and say the disclosure requirements will call for tens of thousands of hours of work and perhaps millions of dollars because so many expenditures would have to be tracked and reported.
"Clearly everyone was chagrined by the secretary's presentation," said Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers. "We're facing rising health care costs, layoffs, companies going bankrupt, people losing retiree benefits. And it's upsetting that she had this huge book, and that was the main thing she came here with. That's not to say we don't want every union to be open and transparent and clean."

HEADLINE: The Accountable Mayor Bloomberg 

 BODY:
Michael Bloomberg, the mayor who is reinventing education in New York City, graded himself a while back. In his first 13 months in office, he said, 80 percent of his 380 campaign promises had been met, were on their way to fulfillment or had at least made it to the drawing board. That, he said good-naturedly, deserved A+. Even allowing for grade inflation, his effort to hold himself accountable is commendable. It also sets a useful precedent. 
 His list was nothing if not comprehensive. One item promised to "track city utilities using modern technology." That one is in the category "launched." Many higher-profile matters, including gaining control of the schools, banning smoking in restaurants and bars and continuing the crackdown on crime, have been entered in the "done" column. Some vows, like not raising taxes or borrowing money, were nullified by the fiscal crisis. 
 While polls continue to show his popularity lagging, especially among his old conservative base, this rookie politician keeps daring the public to take his measure. Right now, many seem to be giving him an F in tax hikes. But the report card might include other categories. For instance:
Social skills: Usually plays well with others, sometimes too well. Gov. George Pataki did little to help the city close its $3 billion deficit. But in public at least, Mr. Bloomberg has not fought back.
Work space: Clean, orderly, open and smoke-free.
Attendance: Always on the job, but disappears on weekends, sometimes re-emerging with a George-Hamiltonish glow.
Creativity: High marks here, from his initiative to increase housing units by tens of thousands to his plan to improve delivery of services through a special 311 line, both getting under way.
Attitude: Optimistic even in dire straits. The mayor keeps selling New York: He won the 2004 Republican National Convention and has New York in the running to be host to the 2012 Olympic Games.
Areas for improvement: Mr. Bloomberg has been trying to demonstrate more empathy for everyday New Yorkers, but he'll have to work harder at that. Sometimes it's the things that can't be measured that mean the most.

HEADLINE: Romney's Campus Plan Would Cut Deficit, and a Political Foe 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Gov. Mitt Romney today proposed to reorganize the University of Massachusetts as part of his plan to cut the state's huge budget deficit. In the process, he would eliminate the $309,000-a-year job of the school's president, William M. Bulger.
 Mr. Romney, a Republican, proposed the plan as a way to save $150 million and at least partly privatize the state university system. Under the plan, the university's main campus at Amherst would become largely independent, depending on increased tuition instead of state aid. The other 4 campuses along with 9 state colleges and 15 community colleges would be restructured into seven regional clusters. 
 But it also happens that Mr. Bulger is a Democrat from South Boston and one of the most powerful political figures in Massachusetts who served for 17 years as president of the state Senate. 
The proposal is expected to set off a major battle with the Legislature, which would decide whether to approve the plan and which is heavily controlled by Democrats, many of them still loyal to Mr. Bulger.
Some students of Boston were as interested in the politics as the educational restructuring. "This is a classic battle of the old Boston versus the new Boston," said Thomas H. O'Connor, a professor of history at Boston College.
"It's the Irish versus the WASP, a culture of a government that spends versus a government that cuts, and it involves a prevailing view in South Boston that the authorities are out to shaft Bulger."
Shawn Feddeman, a spokeswoman for Governor Romney, said the idea to trim Mr. Bulger's job "has nothing to do" with Mr. Bulger himself. "It would be the same if the president was John Doe or Jane Smith," Ms. Feddeman said.
Governor Romney's proposal says reorganizing the University of Massachusetts campuses, state colleges and community colleges into regional clusters would save taxpayer dollars through joint purchasing arrangements and by increasing tuition and fees. Under the plan, the reorganized schools would also focus more heavily on vocational education to help spur business development in the state.
Ms. Feddeman said another benefit of the reorganization would be the end of a need for a president of the overall University of Massachusetts and for the president's large office in downtown Boston, where Mr. Bulger has a staff of 68 people at a cost of $14 million.
"The governor would like to eliminate the need for that extra layer of bureaucracy," Ms. Feddeman said. The president and his staff would be replaced by a new executive office of education. The leaders of the regional universities would be elevated from the title of chancellor to president.
Professor O'Connor, the author of "The Boston Irish: A Political History," and many political figures here say they believe the reorganization plan also reflects a personal clash between Governor Romney and Mr. Bulger, though aides to both men denied it today.
Last December, Mr. Romney suggested that Mr. Bulger, 68, had a civic duty to "respect" Congress by testifying before a Congressional committee investigating his brother, James Bulger, 73, known as Whitey, who was the leader of Boston's most notorious organized crime gang. Whitey Bulger has been a fugitive since 1995, when he fled after a federal grand jury indicted him for racketeering and murder. He is on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Most Wanted List. 
But William Bulger refused to answer questions by the House Government Reform Committee, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Mr. Bulger was also reported to have told a federal grand jury investigating how his brother corrupted F.B.I. agents in Boston that he had "an honest loyalty" to his brother and felt no "obligation to help everyone to catch him."
Mr. Romney was said by aides at the time to be quietly furious about the president of the state university thumbing his nose at law enforcement. The governor could not directly remove Mr. Bulger, since he has been supported by the university's board of trustees and has a contract that runs until 2007.
But now, with his plan, Governor Romney may have found a way. 
Massachusetts faces a $3 billion budget deficit, and during last fall's election Mr. Romney pledged not to raise taxes to close the deficit.
A spokesman for the University of Massachusetts, Robert P. Connolly, said school officials were still trying to understand the details of Mr. Romney's plan.
Mr. Connolly said it appeared that Mr. Romney hoped to reduce state aid to higher education in Massachusetts by $300 million a year, largely by raising tuition and fees for students. In addition, he said, it would mean layoffs of 1,400 of the 13,000 employees just at the five university campuses.
Asked about Mr. Bulger's reaction to Mr. Romney's plan, Mr. Connolly said it was "one of great concern for the University of Massachusetts."
"He really believes dismantling the university is not in the best interest of the commonwealth," Mr. Connolly said.
But Mr. Connolly said it was not correct to portray Mr. Romney's proposal to eliminate Mr. Bulger's job as a personal or political attack. 
State Senator David Magnani, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the Senate education committee, said, "Everything the governor proposes will be taken seriously, because the truth of the matter is that we are facing an enormous deficit."
"But having said that," Senator Magnani added, "we need to look closely at whether the savings the governor proposes are real and whether closing the president's office saves money."
In fact, Senator Magnani said, Mr. Bulger has brought in more money for the university than his office costs by attracting new federal and private research dollars and keeping good relations with the Legislature, which has preserved the school's budget in hard economic times.

HEADLINE: HOW IT WORKS; 
From a White House Roof, Solar Power Proclaims Gains

BYLINE:  By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
THE White House may be occupied by an administration steeped in the oil industry, but solar power has quietly become part of the landscape at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
 Since September, a grid of 167 solar panels on the roof of a maintenance shed has been delivering electricity to the White House grounds. Another solar installation has been helping to provide hot water. Yet another has been keeping the water warm in the presidential pool. 
James Doherty, an architect for the National Park Service, decided to install the systems a few years ago. It was time to replace the roof on what is affectionately called the Pony Shed, a maintenance building that replaced the stable that once housed Macaroni, a pony owned by President John F. Kennedy's daughter, Caroline. 
 The Park Service, which is responsible for the building, had already mandated that any refurbishments of its facilities should include environmentally friendly design where possible. 
 "We thought if we were able to reduce our energy consumption, that was a positive step forward," Mr. Doherty said.
 He installed solar panels, called photovoltaic or PV modules, along with a new copper roof.
 The panels are made up of thin wafers of silicon. When light photons hit the silicon atoms, electrons break free, creating a direct current. An inverter turns the electricity into an alternating current that can be fed into the White House power grid.
 The thermal water systems are installed on the roof too, but they work differently. Heat from sunlight is absorbed by water flowing behind specially formulated black absorber plates. The water is warmed directly by the sun without the need for a traditional water heater. 
 To some, the word "solar" evokes images of the 1970's, and the flashbacks aren't pretty. Many people remember leaky roofs and maintenance problems that came with solar water-heating systems. The problem with photovoltaic modules, which became commercially available in the early 1980's, was their price tag. They were initially so expensive that the electricity cost 100 times as much as power from conventional sources.
 "Today we are outgrowing that reputation," said Mark Farber, the chief executive of Evergreen Solar, a company in Marlboro, Mass., that supplied the solar roof modules. 
 Mr. Farber said that mass production and improved manufacturing techniques had pushed prices down, and estimated that photovoltaic technology now costs one and a half to four times as much as conventional power sources when costs are spread over time. But the cost can be lower than that of electricity from conventional sources in areas with high power bills and government subsidies for the use of alternative energy. 
 Glenn Hamer, executive director of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said that the leaky water heaters that tainted the industry had been driven from the market. 
 A slow but steady resurgence of solar technology has taken place in the last two decades. In 1982, the year the government's Energy Information Administration started tracking shipments of PV modules, about 7,000 peak kilowatts (the measure used by photovoltaic companies) were shipped to purchasers in the United States. In 2001, about five times that many -- 36,000 -- were shipped. 
 Across the country, and particularly in California, where energy costs have spiked, more solar roofs are being installed each year. Some are generating a surplus of electricity that can be sold to the electric companies. 
 "It's starting to get very exciting," said Steven J. Strong, the solar designer who guided the White House project and whose company, Solar Design Associates, has been advocating the technology since the 1970's. "We're busier than ever."
 At the same time, solar thermal systems for heating water have become almost commonplace for new pools, said Maureen McIntyre, editor of Solar Today, a monthly magazine. "We now have solar hot water systems that are mature and affordably priced and make sense," she said.
 Still, solar power makes up only 1 percent of the total energy generated in the United States, according to Mr. Hamer of the industries association. 
 Many environmentalists do not expect a federal focus on solar power anytime soon, given that President Bush and many members of his team worked in the oil industry.
 In fact, the announcement that solar technology had been installed at the White House came not from the government but from the solar industry, and only after the equipment had been in place for four months. The lack of fanfare may be because the scale of the project was small: the amount of electricity generated so far is minuscule. In the first four months, the panels generated about 1,100 kilowatt-hours of power, Mr. Doherty said. 
 Given that other institutions in the area pay 4.9 cents per kilowatt-hour in the winter, that translates into $54 in savings. Of course, that calculation does not take into account the cost of installing the system, which was $75,000 -- higher than usual for such a project because of the logistics of doing construction at the White House. (The cost of installing the two hot-water systems was $25,000.)
 Mr. Doherty said he expected the panels to yield more savings in the summer months, when traditional energy costs are higher and the PV modules capture more light. He stressed that the installation was a long-term investment. "We know it will pay for itself," he said. 

GRAPHIC: Drawings (Frank O'Connell/The New York Times) Chart: "Not Your Typical Roofing Job"Solar energy may not yet be as economical as power from conventional sources, but the technology has had a resurgence in recent years. Among the latest customers is the White House, where several solar systems, including a photovoltaic one, have been installed. THE INSTALLATIONBruce Newell of Evergreen Solar installing solarcell panels on the roof of a maintenance shed at the southwest corner of the White House grounds. THE PANELSEach panel contains 36 cells connected by conductive strips or bus bars. THE CELLSEach cell consists of two layers of doped silicon n-type, which has an excess negative charge, and p-type, with an excess positive charge. Sunlight hitting the silicon frees electrons, creating current. CONVERTING ENERGYIn a solar cell, the energy of light photons frees up electrons, which leave the cell, creating electricity. The sandwich of two types of silicon creates a diode, which allows electrons to flow in only one direction between the two layers. Photons striking atoms in the cell create free electrons , which migrate to one layer, and electron holes -- the absence of one electron -- which migrate to the other. USING THE POWERElectricity from a solar cell is converted to alternating current by an inverter, and then flows into the house wiring or back out into the electrical grid.

Bush Ties Iraq Success To Peace in Middle East
President Bush, under pressure from European and Arab countries, declared that removing Saddam Hussein from power would bring stability to the Middle East and could set the stage for peace between Israel and a "truly Democratic" Palestinian state. A1

The fruitless hunt for Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is a reminder of the Bush administration's inability to achieve one of the main goals of its antiterror effort. Both are at large and apparently are the sources of taped exhortations for more violence. A12

In the first meeting of key Iraqi dissidents on Iraqi soil in nearly a decade, President Bush's envoy told the advisory committee of the Iraqi National Congress that the United States did not want to rule Iraq and would rely on a broad-based opposition to govern the country if the U.S. invades. A11

As the Bush administration stepped up lobbying efforts for its new resolution on Iraq, European leaders worked determinedly to ensure against defections from their well-defined ranks on the issue of waging war against Iraq. A12

Israel Hopes War Brings Peace
Israelis are putting hopes for Israeli-Arab coexistence in an American war on Iraq. Officials are already thinking past that possible conflict to urge a continued, assertive American role in the Middle East. A12

Sharon Replaces Netanyahu
In a surprise move, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon replaced his foreign minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, with Silvan Shalom, the departing finance minister, as he filled the most important cabinet posts in his government with members of his Likud Party. A8

North Korea Starts Reactor
North Korea has restarted a reactor at its primary nuclear complex, enabling it to produce nuclear waste that could provide a source of plutonium for nuclear weapons. A1

Ruling on Sperm Mix-Up
Britain's top family court judge declared that a black man whose sperm had mistakenly been used to fertilize the eggs of a white woman at a fertility clinic was the legal father of the twins born nine months later. But the white family was granted custody. A5

NATIONAL A20-29

NASA E-Mail Messages Predicted Columbia's Fate
In the days before the shuttle Columbia disintegrated, engineers explored the possibility that the shuttle had been fatally damaged on liftoff and precisely predicted some of the symptoms that the orbiter showed on re-entry. A1

Abuse Inquiry to Be Expanded
The top general in the Air Force endorsed a Congressional call for an independent inquiry at the Air Force Academy, where at least 20 women say they have been raped or sexually assaulted in recent years. A1

Labor Leader Cites Corruption
Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao ignited a furor among labor leaders, including the teamster president James P. Hoffa, when she cited repeated examples of union corruption while addressing the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s winter meeting. A20

Hate Crime Makes it to Trial
Federal prosecutors in Mississippi called on witnesses who discovered a body in 1966 to show that the body was found on federal land, which allows the trial of a 72-year-old man for murder even though he was acquitted decades ago. A20

Budget Threatens U.S. Safety
As the Bush administration continues to warn of a high risk of a new wave of domestic terrorist strikes, the White House is acknowledging its huge new spending plan does not provide enough money to protect against terrorist attacks. A14

Pentagon Tallies War Costs
The Pentagon and the White House budget office are wrestling over how much money to seek from Congress to pay for a war against Iraq and reconstruction costs between now and the end of September. A14

Excess Ticket Sales Cited
A manager for several bands that played at the club that burned to the ground last week killing 97 people said that tickets for concerts there were often sold far in excess of its legal capacity of about 300 people. A28

Court Rejects 80's Judgment
The Supreme Court overturned a federal racketeering judgment against anti-abortion groups that conducted a widespread campaign of disrupting and blockading abortion clinics during the 1980's. A23

NEW YORK/REGION B1-9

Pit Memorial Chosen For Site of Trade Center
Officials overseeing the city's effort to rebuild Lower Manhattan following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center agreed to hire Studio Daniel Libeskind, the Berlin-based firm whose plan for the site centers on the excavated pit at the trade center, ringed by glass towers that swirl upward to a 1,776-foot spire. A1

10 Die in Nursing Home Fire
A fire tore through a nursing home in Hartford, killing 10 residents and injuring 23 and sending dozens of frail, terrified people into the frigid night. Investigators were hoping to interview a resident of the home in connection with the blaze. B1

Mayor's Rating Dips in Poll
A Quinnipiac University poll put Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's approval rating at 48 percent citywide, but he is fading fast among his key constituents. Mr. Bloomberg won 76 percent of the vote in Staten Island, but the majority of those residents now do not approve of his job performance, according to the Times poll. B1

Recruits Affect Crime Rate
Since the beginning of the year, crime has dropped by 43 percent. Police officials say the declines are due to Operation Impact, a two-month-old program that put 1,400 rookies into the city's toughest neighborhoods. B1

HEADLINE: Voters Say Why Mayor Is Slipping In Popularity 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
At the mention of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's name, Barbara Carr's arm moved furiously up and down, as if she were trying to wave away the odor of three-day-old cod.
 "Please, no, I can't stand him!" said Ms. Carr, turning her sunglassed gaze toward a case of cream pies and zeppoles in Alfonso's Pastry Shoppe, a popular bakery in the Meier's Corner neighborhood of Staten Island. 
 Ms. Carr, 45, cast her vote for Mr. Bloomberg with a majority of Staten Island voters in the 2001 election. But the mayor's decision to raise property taxes 18.5 percent, his antismoking legislation and his scant appearances in her borough have since turned her against him. 
"At that time I thought he was going to do things for us," Ms. Carr said. "But he has come down so hard on us, it's absurd. To me, New York City is his little play toy that he sits back and plays with and then jets back to one of his islands as he watches us fall into chaos."
To be fair, Mr. Bloomberg does not own any islands, although he does have a nice house in Bermuda. And neighborhoods like Ms. Carr's, Grant City, more or less enjoy the same level of services as a year ago, according to the latest Mayor's Management Report. Crime in Staten Island also fell 11.7 percent from 2001 to 2002 -- hardly chaos.
But Ms. Carr's profound distaste for the mayor represents a potentially alarming erosion of support for Mr. Bloomberg among New Yorkers who made him their mayor after Rudolph W. Giuliani left: the conservative, property-owning, Giuliani-loving New Yorkers who helped him squeak to victory. It explains more than anything else why a New York Times poll taken in January found that more than half of New Yorkers disapprove of his handling of the job even as he lost little ground in Manhattan.
Yesterday, a Quinnipiac University poll put the mayor's approval rating at 48 percent citywide.
Mr. Bloomberg won 45 percent of the vote in Manhattan, and yesterday's poll had him gaining in that borough. He is fading fast, however, among his key constituents. Mr. Bloomberg won 76 percent of the vote in Staten Island, but a majority of those residents now do not approve of his job performance, according to the Times poll.
In Queens, the other borough Mr. Bloomberg narrowly won (he took 54 percent of the vote there), only 31 percent approve of him now. Mr. Bloomberg gained only 41 percent of the Bronx and 44 percent of the Brooklyn vote, and his approval rating has sunk to 21 percent and 29 percent respectively in those boroughs.
Much of the erosion of support is among voters who were most affected by the property tax increase and, it would seem, least support his anti-smoking policies, based on interviews with those polled and with other New Yorkers. They are the people who least appreciate hearing about tolls on East River bridges, after a recent hefty increase in parking fines.
"He is obviously facing different problems than Giuliani," said Marco Ferrante, an auditor from Westerleigh who stopped into Alfonso's on Sunday (apple pie and a pound of cookies). "But I disagree with the way his only solution is to blindly raise taxes. I think he needs to cut services, because there are plenty of services that New York City provides that I could do without." 
Mr. Bloomberg and his aides dismiss polls as little more than snapshots taken at a bad moment during the party. His aides insist that, at the end of the day, New Yorkers will favorably view Mr. Bloomberg's accomplishments and get past their short-term personal pain.
"Unlike a senator or a congressman," said William T. Cunningham, the mayor's communication director, "mayors make daily decisions, and the people evaluate you based on those decisions."
But clearly, Mr. Bloomberg must either regain his base or make significant inroads among traditionally Democratic voters if he hopes to win the second term he claims to want. 
"When you lose your base, that is not a good sign," said Philip J. Friedman, a political consultant in Manhattan. "He is not doing a good job at conveying a sense of connection with the working people in the city, particularly among those who voted for him based on the endorsement of Giuliani -- outer-borough homeowners, Irish and Italian Catholics, people in small businesses. Among people like that, people who voted for him based on that, there is a significant level of disappointment."
Much of the unhappiness has to do with the tax increase, although even disenchanted voters acknowledge that the economic situation Mr. Bloomberg inherited was worse than anything Mr. Giuliani ever faced. But for many who once supported him, there is a feeling that he is piling on.
"I am 48 years old, my mom is 73 and we've lived in New York all our lives," Robin Leckow, who lives in Whitestone, Queens, wrote in a recent e-mail message to a reporter. Ms. Leckow said she is a smoker, like her mother, whose social life revolves around bingo. The new smoking law prohibiting smoking in bingo parlors has ruined that, she said. "She won't get out of the house now, or see her friends," Ms. Leckow said.
"The mayor has completely priced us out of buying our cigarettes in New York," added Ms. Leckow, who voted for Mr. Bloomberg. "So once a month we drive out of state and buy cartons for our own use. Now he wants to criminalize this, and hunt me down for taxes.
"To add insult to injury," she went on, "my one enjoyment on Saturday is visiting the Poppenhusen branch of the Queens Borough Public Library. Since I work during the week, I can't get there but Saturday. Thank the mayor for me next time you see him for canceling Saturday service there."
Educational policy has also threatened Mr. Bloomberg's support. His attempt to remake the city's public schools was expected to draw fire in minority neighborhoods, where the former centralized system was most popular. But it has also attracted controversy in the city's white ethnic enclaves.
"The educational issue is the most important one to my constituents," said State Senator Frank Padavan, a Republican from Queens, who, along with four other Republican legislators, has objected to the Department of Education's plan to replace 32 district superintendents with 10 regional superintendents. "This doesn't just affect children, which is paramount, but also the property values of homes. Districts 25 and 26 are high-performing districts, and they don't want to see that change."
Mr. Bloomberg has also been criticized for being remote. As if in response, he has spent more weekends visiting churches and attending evening events around the city, although usually in Democratic strongholds like minority neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx, not in Staten Island and eastern Queens.
Most political consultants said it is far too early for Mr. Bloomberg to be written off, and some noted New York Democrats' recent tendency to form a circular firing squad at election time, leaving Mr. Bloomberg open for another win. But the mayor has a plan to make this entire issue irrelevant -- he is pushing for nonpartisan municipal elections.

F.C.C. Members Defend Proposals on Bell Companies

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The five members of the Federal Communications Commission defended their new telephone and broadband policy in front of a Congressional hearing today, but they conceded that their compromise proposal, which requires the regional Bell companies to continue to share their phone lines with competitors, left no one happy and was not certain to pump up the flailing telecommunications sector in the near term.
 The sharp divisions among the commissioners were aired in their first public appearance together since the widely anticipated vote last week for the new regulations. The regulations passed on a 3-to-2 vote. The commission members appeared before a panel of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Most of the lawmakers' questions, as well as some anger, were directed at the F.C.C. chairman, Michael K. Powell, and a commissioner, Kevin J. Martin, a Republican who had brokered a compromise with the two Democratic members of the commission. 
 The critics of the compromise included some congressmen who have been among the most outspoken advocates for the so-called Baby Bells -- Verizon, SBC, BellSouth and Qwest Communications International. 
The Bells, which have been lobbying for deregulatory relief for years, had been pushing for new rules that would free them from sharing both their telephone and broadband operations with competitors.
Instead, the commission freed them from sharing broadband lines but forced the Baby Bells to continue to share their telephone lines until state regulators determine that there is enough local competition to permit deregulation.
"I believe the order we adopted last week achieves a principled, balanced approach," said Mr. Martin, who has close ties to the White House. 
After the ruling, many of the local phone companies announced that they would not be making new investments in high-speed services as a result of getting only half of what they wanted from the ruling. But Mr. Powell dismissed the Baby Bells' reaction, saying, "Here is a lot of crying crybaby reaction to the decision." He said he thought that the announcements were more like "public affairs reactions" than like reasoned management decisions. Mr. Powell also said he was getting tired of the "passion play between billion-dollar self-interested actors."
The committee, which is generally sympathetic to the Baby Bells, also criticized the local phone companies for their failure to invest. Several congressmen noted that the Baby Bells had received a lot of what they had asked for since the 1996 Telecommunications Act but were still not making the investments that they had promised they would make.
The sense of impatience among House members is notable because the House is often seen as being more favorable to the Baby Bells than the Senate. There are a large number of telecommunications jobs in local districts, and the industry has engaged in intense lobbying over the last several years. 
Last year, after much lobbying, the House passed the Tauzin-Dingell broadband deregulation bill, which would have freed the Bells from some of the line-sharing requirements. While the bill was halted in the Senate by Senator Ernest Hollings, last week's F.C.C. ruling essentially accomplishes a lot of what was in the Tauzin-Dingell bill and more. The commission's ruling means that the Bells are not obligated to make new investments in infrastructure, as they were under Tauzin-Dingell. 
But the congressmen and the commissioners all noted that the continuing regulatory uncertainty that would come with state-by-state evaluations on local phone service would probably stall telecommunications investment as the rules made their way through court challenges.
A number of congressmen were overtly hostile on this point, including Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. Tauzin was critical of the regulatory role of the states. He argued that the ruling would result in 51 local procedures with 51 lawsuits and 12 different appeals courts, "ending up at the Supreme Court that ordered the deregulation in the first place."
But in a letter sent to Mr. Powell in June 2002, Mr. Tauzin himself wrote: "The commission must evaluate the rationale for requiring the unbundling of a network element based upon specific geographic and class-of-customer characteristics of individual markets across the nation. Uniform, national rules do not accurately reflect the state of competition and the unique economic characteristics of individual markets."

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Weekender Westport, Conn.

BYLINE:  By JOANNE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
AT a recent meeting of the Westport Representative Town Meeting, the local governing body, two members put forth a resolution on Iraq: "Let the United Nations work it out and exhaust diplomatic and economic means to avoid war." Meanwhile, another member and some townspeople asked for a review of the regulations about the gamboling rights of dogs without leashes on Compo Beach. 
 The Iraq resolution was withdrawn after recent Security Council deliberations. A section of the beach from the bathhouse south, it was finally decided, would be cordoned off from fall to spring to accommodate dogs yearning to run free. 
 "The whole thing generated a lot of controversy," said Gordon Joseloff, the town meeting's moderator (and, in the interest of full disclosure, the writer's brother-in-law). "Some saw it as an attempt to limit the beach to dogs from Westport, that it was reminiscent of how they were trying to restrict beach access in Greenwich, and that it seemed unwelcoming." 
Inclusiveness, whether in the matter of quadrupeds or bipeds or international affairs, the buttoned-down or the unbuttoned, is what Westport is all about. It seems that everyone is on a committee, ad hoc or otherwise. Peter DeVries, the novelist and a Westport resident, was smack on target when he wrote in a 1950 Holiday magazine article that the town was so heterogeneous "that a crazy quilt would do as a metaphor for it, provided you mean one in which there is not even any unity of fabrics."
Another resident, the actress Joanne Woodward, described the town as "eclectic and cosmopolitan" in the foreword to the book "Westport, Connecticut" by Woody Klein (Greenwood Press, 2000). "It's become a Mecca for those who are traditionally untraditional," she wrote.
Italians came to build railroads in the 19th century and were followed by Germans and Eastern Europeans, and they all formed friendships with the indigenous Yankee farmers.
"Westport was much more open to this influx than other towns on Connecticut's Gold Coast," said Mr. Klein, press secretary to Mayor John V. Lindsay during Mr. Lindsay's first term and a Westport weekender who became a full-time resident.
In the 20th century, the town earned a reputation as an artists' colony. F. Scott Fitzgerald, with his wife, Zelda, in tow, wrote part of "The Great Gatsby" there. Elizabeth Taylor was a fixture during her marriage to Mike Todd. Tallulah Bankhead, idiosyncratic even for an actress and a Southerner, was a resident, as were Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Bette Davis, Helen Keller, Martha Raye, Neil Sedaka and Rod Serling.
Possibly because of its long roster of celebrities, Westport manages to keep its collective cool when a big name swings into view. "There's a code of behavior that everyone understands," Mr. Klein said. "Paul Newman can walk down the street and no one will look into his blue eyes. Well-known people come here and they know they'll be left alone." 

The Scene
Westport is a town for all seasons and for all interests. In the winter there are skating and cross-country skiing at the 191-acre Longshore Country Club, bought by the town in 1960, which also has a golf course, three swimming pools, tennis courts and a sailing school. Westporters buy annual "handpasses" ($35 for a full-time adult resident and $145 for a "nonresident taxpayer," meaning a weekend-home owner) for access to Longshore's attractions; golfers still must pay greens fees ($10 to $16 for handpass holders).
Residents have their choice of sand -- Compo Beach on Long Island Sound, Old Mill Beach and Burying Hill Beach. Kayaks ply the waters of Old Mill Pond and the Saugatuck River, which runs close enough to the local Starbucks that you can moor your canoe and take a latte break. Those who prefer their boats with sails or motors have the Minute Man and Cedar Point Yacht Clubs.
On land, there are the Westport Country Playhouse, where the Broadway production of "Our Town," starring Paul Newman (Ms. Woodward's husband) originated; the White Barn Theater; the Levitt Pavilion, a band shell that is the site of summer concerts; the Westport Arts Center; and the Westport Library, with reading rooms that overlook the Saugatuck River. On most Saturdays there is a story time for children, and on Sundays there are concerts, talks by authors and movies. On Sunday, as part of Black History Month, Ossie Davis is scheduled to be on hand for a screening of "A Raisin in the Sun," the 1961 film starring Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee.
The lines are long and the doughnuts first rate at Coffee An'. Customers, according to Elias Vlandis, the owner, include the radio personality Don Imus and Bill Clinton, who, Mr. Vlandis said, received occasional doughnut shipments at the White House.
A few blocks away, at Westport Pizza, one of the few businesses left on Main Street that are not part of a chain, families lay claim to the tables in the rear while teenagers grab the real estate out front. Young patrons are offered lollipops from a Tupperware tub. The welcoming atmosphere may explain the strong, if unsuccessful, showing by the owner, Joseph Mioli, when he ran for the state's General Assembly a few years back.
When John and Lynn Shanahan, parents of three young children, began looking for a weekend house, their first priority was a town with an easy commute from New York. Westport had that and more, said Mr. Shanahan, 43, a commodities trader turned teacher.
"It was the first town on the sound that was pretty self-sufficient," he said. "It wasn't a bedroom community."
He added, "There's a down-home atmosphere and a real town spirit."
Never is that spirit more apparent than during the Memorial Day parade. So what if the participants -- Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Little Leaguers, firemen, emergency medical service personnel, the League of Women Voters in stars and stripes -- frequently outnumber the spectators. "I grew up here and can remember marching in the parade as a Girl Scout," said Diane Farrell, Westport's first selectwoman. "It's a thrill to see the festivities. Norman Rockwell couldn't paint a more poignant picture of hometown America."

Pros
"You get a full holiday experience here, and it's only an hour away from the city," said Tom Seligson, an executive producer with CBS News who grew up in Westport and returned to raise a family. "There's a party at the beach all summer long, and it's not exclusionary. All you have to do is show up and you're part of it."
While the mom and pop store is all but a thing of the past on Main Street, there is still a small-town feeling in the shopping area, and odds are good, Mr. Seligson said, that the druggist will know your name.
"You get a lot of bang for your tax dollars," said Mr. Joseloff, the town meeting moderator. "They're rising," he said of taxes, "but still low compared to Westchester or Long Island."

Cons
People think twice before venturing downtown on weekends -- and even weekdays -- because traffic and parking are daunting. Parking is also tight at Compo Beach in the summer. 
Main Street sometimes seems like a mall, one with a pretty tough crowd. The town seems to attract competitive Type A people and, as one woman said, "Everyone is so thin."
"Westport has become a bit of Beverly Hills," said another resident, who asked that his name not be attached to comments that might offend some of his neighbors. "It's caught that disease. There is a tendency to show off your wealth with a big home and a big car." 

Real Estate Market
"The common misconception is that prices are going down," said Beverly Walsh, sales manager of the William Raveis Real Estate office in Westport (203-227-4343; www.raveis.com). Indeed, a home priced last year at $700,000 would have a sticker price of $770,000 today, a 10 percent increase that has been a constant over the last few years. Ms. Walsh said that the market was not hot, but that "if a house is attractively priced, it gets multiple offers."
"What you get for your money in Westport," she added, "is far greater value than in Greenwich or Darien or New Canaan for about the same commute."
In some parts of town, particularly near Compo Beach, houses sit cheek by jowl. North of the Merritt Parkway, however, two-acre-plus parcels are common. Colonials are more abundant than anything else, but buyers can find antiques, contemporaries, Cape Cods and the occasional stone house. What they won't find are homes under $400,000 or many under $500,000. Under $600,000? "Well," Ms. Walsh said. "Right now I've got four."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Weekender column in Escapes on Friday, about Westport, Conn., misstated the date for a screening of the film "A Raisin in the Sun" and an appearance by the actor Ossie Davis at the public library there. Both were on Feb. 23, not March 2.

Art Fairs

"WORKS ON PAPER," Seventh Regiment Armory, Park Avenue at 67th Street, (212) 777-5218 (through Sunday). Hours: Today, noon to 8 p.m.; tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 7 p.m. Admission: $15. The least expensive and most generously receptive of art-making surfaces has its moment. Eighty-nine dealers from Europe and North America are offering drawings, watercolors, prints, photographs, posters and books. Visitors will find works by all the usual suspects, from old masters like Rembrandt and Durer, to Modernists like Picasso and Matisse, to young and emerging stars of the future. You may also discover all kinds of strange and arcane things from the more specialized fields of art history. Prices can be mind-boggling, or surprisingly reasonable. If you are thinking of starting an art collection but lack deep pockets, there is no better place to begin (Ken Johnson).

Museums

JO BAER, "The Minimalist Years, 1960-1975," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 13). In the mid-1960's, Ms. Baer framed blazing white fields with black bands inlaid with strips of bright color and made some of modernism's most austere paintings. Mimicking picture frames and note paper while enforcing an intense perceptual focus, they are at once sardonically self-referential and romantic, and they form the high point of this small survey of her early years. Also on view are some tentative first steps and weaker later works, whose boxy canvases make their eccentric painted motifs look arbitrary and decorative. The sense of an artist running out of steam is corroborated by Ms. Baer's moving to Ireland in the late 1970's and working in a figurative style. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, children, students and 60+ (Roberta Smith).

* "MATTHEW BARNEY: THE CREMASTER CYCLE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through June 11). The most anticipated show by any American artist to emerge in a decade or more. "Cremaster," Mr. Barney's nine-year, five-film project, here for the first time presented whole, is an inspired benchmark of ambition, scope and forthright provocation for art in the new century. I recall Elizabeth Murray's describing how Philip Guston's crazy late works gave her heart to do her own mature paintings. Mr. Barney has brought to the art world a new freedom to explore narrative. He has introduced a new repertory of materials, gooey, strange, malleable and synthetic, which nobody thought of as germane before. Never mind that the films and many (not all) of his related sculptures, installations and photographs are very beautiful. The show, an installation itself, brings them together. The earliest "Cremaster" sculptures are film props, cobbled into installations that don't gel. But the latest are better: twin steel towers framed in plastic; a suite of abstract sculptures derived from automobile chassis. Vaseline and plastic combine with cement and steel -- pink and gray, rough and smooth, hard and soft -- the materials sustaining a narrative of formal eloquence. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9 for students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "MONTIEN BOONMA: THE TEMPLE OF THE MIND," Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742 (through May 11). The art of the Thai artist Montien Boonma (1953-2000) combines many influences, from Southeast Asian Buddhism to Arte Povera and Joseph Beuys. But his art, by turns witty and somber, is not primarily about hybrid identities; it is about how to forge a life of psychic balance in an unbalanced and unbalancing world. In part he did so through the use of repeated, resonant symbols: the monk's alms bowl, the temple bell. He also turned art into an embracing sensual experience by infusing his installations with healing fragrances. There's nobody like him and nothing in town like this modestly scaled survey show. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

* "CHALLENGE OF THE MODERN: AFRICAN-AMERICAN ARTISTS 1925-1945," Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through March 30). This ambitious show tries to demonstrate how Modernism affected the art of African-Americans differently from the way it did white artists. Among the elements were the belated engagement with African art; the image of the "New Negro," whose militant behavior broke from traditional conformity with white expectations; performance, sexuality and the black body, as exemplified by Paul Robeson, Josephine Baker and Joe Louis; and the great migration from the rural South to the urban North between 1913 and 1946. The more than 150 works range from subtle abstractions by Norman Lewis and Wifredo Lam to lively photographs of protest demonstrations and Harlem social life by James VanDerZee and Morgan and Marvin Smith. A stimulating and well-presented roundup, although some offerings that contribute to the show's thesis do not serve it well as artistic examples. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and 62+; $1, children under 12 (Grace Glueck).

* "THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT: PHOTOGRAPHS BY RYAN McGINLEY," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through May 18). It isn't often that an artist makes his New York solo exhibition debut in the august galleries of the Whitney. But Mr. McGinley, 26, is doing so as part of the museum's "First Exposure" series, a showcase for new photography. He works in what might be described as a life-style genre, whose exemplars also include Nan Goldin, Wolfgang Tillmans and Larry Clark. The 20 large color pictures of Mr. McGinley's 20-something friends, lovers and fellow artists avoid the abjective grit of Mr. Clark's work and the noirish narcissicism of Ms. Goldin's. Instead, these are basically sunny, feel-good pictures, particularly interesting for an approach to sexuality that suggests intriguing socio-political shifts in gay self-presentation. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Cotter).

* "LEONARDO DA VINCI, MASTER DRAFTSMAN," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through March 30). This show has blockbuster written all over it. With 118 of Leonardo's drawings, it is the largest gathering of his work yet seen in America. The lending institutions are superstarry: the Uffizi, the Louvre, the Vatican, the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. And the Met has given it the imperial treatment: crimson walls, acres of space, a catalog as thick as as a couple of telephone books. Are the drawings, which represent the bulk of this artist's surviving work, worth all the fuss? In a word, totally. Individually, many are glorious, some are workmanlike, a few are plain weird. As a package, though -- as the data stream output of a single sensibility -- they are huge, and very alive. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "MATISSE PICASSO," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 33rd Street at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through May 19). If you're thinking of skipping it because of the crowds, that's not a good enough excuse. This is one for the ages: an eye-educating, often revelatory parlor game, with the fate of modern art as the stakes. The premise is a little dubious -- the two of them competing as if in stately isolation from everything else going on in art -- but the results look great. Choosing a winner is the sport of the event and the inevitable outcome of pitting titans mano a mano. Matisse comes out looking consistently good. To grasp 20th-century art, Picasso once said, "You ought to see side by side everything Matisse and I were doing." He was right about that. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; to 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Admission to this exhibition: $20; $15.50, students and 65+; under 16 with an adult, free. Reserved tickets: Ticketmaster at (212) 307-5577; or toll free at (866) 879-6662, with Ticketmaster surcharges (Kimmelman).

* "THE QUILTS OF GEE'S BEND," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through March 9). The most ebullient exhibition of the New York art season comes in the unlikely guise of a show of hand-stitched quilts from a remote, historically black community along the Alabama River. For generations the women of Gee's Bend have passed down an indigenous style of quilting geometric patterns out of old britches, cornmeal sacks, Sears corduroy swatches and hand-me-down leisure suits -- whatever happened to be around. Imagine Matisse and Klee arising not from rarefied Europe but from the soil of the rural South. The best designs, minimalist and spare, turn out to be some of the most miraculous works of modern art that America has produced. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* "THOMAS STRUTH, 1977-2002," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 18). This midcareer retrospective is the right event for right now: serious, tradition-bound, circumspect about the world. Mr. Struth operates from a chilly peak, where the air is thin. But what results are obsessively meticulous photographs, some of them enormous, like mural paintings. They are hypnotic, silent, slightly claustrophobic, brainy and gorgeous, qualities that can seem in lively tension with one another. Art is a means of "locating yourself in your time," Mr. Struth has said. He has done series of streets, jungles, museums, portraits and church facades. Standing before his crowded museums and churches, we can become absorbed in the chaos of culture, sacred places made profane. In the jungle we acquiesce to the spiritual pleasure of solitude. The silence is calming. We may find ourselves in our time. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

"ANNE VALLAYER-COSTER: PAINTER TO THE COURT OF MARIE ANTOINETTE," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through March 23). Vallayer-Coster (1744-1818), the daughter of a Parisian jewlery dealer, had grand successes as a painter early on. At 26, she was elected a full member of the Royal Academy. A decade later, Marie Antoinette commissioned a portrait. But it was as a still-life painter that she was most valued, and will probably continue to be on the evidence of this attractive show. Its star entry, the large painting "Still Life With Seashells and Coral" (1769), is a tour de force: ghostly, sexy, glamorously bizarre. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $5 for students; $8 for 62+ (Cotter).

* "VIDEO ACTS: SINGLE CHANNEL WORKS FROM THE COLLECTIONS OF PAMELA AND RICHARD KRAMLICH AND NEW ART TRUST," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through April 13). Wading through this sprawling survey of early single-channel video art is more edifying than enjoyable, but anyone interested in contemporary art should make the effort. Expertly installed with viewing efficiency in mind, it concentrates on works made mostly by lone artists experimenting behind closed studio doors in the 1970's, with special emphasis on the body-oriented efforts of Bruce Nauman, Vito Acconci, Joan Jonas and Marina Abramovic and Ulay. A handful of recent videotapes by Pipilotti Rist and others underscores the feeling that both the medium and its early pioneers have come a long way -- and there is, thankfully, no going back. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+ (Smith).

Galleries: 57th Street

EDWIN DICKINSON, Babcock, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 767-1852 (through March 28). Dickinson was a modern romantic who drew with magical old-masterly refinement. A kind of melancholic ecstasy animates the modestly scaled paintings and drawings in this show. Pictures of blocky houses exude Hopperesque nostalgia. The image of a bench by the sea borders on the mystical. Drawings of old buildings in Europe and the inside of a greenhouse are like Proustian reveries (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

ELSA D'ARRIGO, Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-9666 (through March 8). These bounteous constructions, made with cloth, paint and thread, are composed of small units linked in honeycomb arrangements that suggest cellular growth. Cascading down a wall, flattened against one or rising from the floor, each is painted in subtly applied colors. Aside from suggesting nature's exuberant hand, the repetition of the units into an assembled mass is intended to invoke the idea of shrines with their accretions of objects. And it works: the earthy connects with the spiritual here (Glueck).

WENDELL GLADSTONE, "Four Seasons and Other Paintings," Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238 (through March 15). Mr. Gladstone inventively practices the contemporary genre in which paint itself is treated as a near sculptural material. His medium-large pictures are strange, fairy-talelike scenes, involving dogs, birds and a dead deer in a shifty, primordial world. They look as if they were made by gluing onto raw canvas pieces of carefully cut out, variously textured and brightly colored paint. The possibilities for further development are exciting (Johnson).

ETHAN JACKSON, "Eden," Cornell DeWitt, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 695-6845 (through March 15). Tacked up on bulletin boards in general stores all over Vermont are snapshots of deer hunters proudly posing with the deer they killed. Mr. Jackson collects these pictures and here presents hundreds of digitally copied examples organized in grids. He has also incorporated images of dead deer into overwrought Surrealistic montages. It is the repulsive vernacular snaps, all different yet all weirdly similar, that captivate (Johnson).

PETER LOFTUS AND MEG SHIELDS, Fischbach, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 759-2345 (through March 15). West meets East. In "Mendocino to Monterey" Mr. Loftus makes paintings of the rugged coast of California in which light, color and focus are amplified to near trippy effect; up close you discover a pleasing dry and brushy painterly application. Working in Provincetown and other East Coast locales, Ms. Shields makes small, squarish landscapes in which there is always a water tower. Titled "Landmarks," their smoothly painted naturalism, sensitivity to light and romantic moods recall the 19th-century Luminist painters (Johnson).

* INIGO MANGLANO-OVALLE, "Purgatory," Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999 (through March 8). Possibly the most beautiful object to be found in a contemporary art gallery right now is Mr. Manglano-Ovalle's "Cloud Prototype No. 1," an elephantine, bulbous volume covered in satiny titanium leaf and suspended in midair. It is based on digital analysis of an actual thunderstorm cloud and is just one element of a grand scheme to realize a modern version of Dante's "Divine Comedy"(Johnson).

DONALD MOFFETT, "The Extravagant Vein," Marianne Boesky, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9889 (through March 15). Since the 1980's, Mr. Moffett has been making some of the quietest, subtlest political art around, and he continues to do so. The main part of this show is a series of impressionistic-looking landscapes of bridges and leafy glades. From a distance they have the flickering iridescence of Monet's Giverney paintings; in fact, they are films projected onto canvases. All the images are of the Rambles in Central Park, an area known both as a bird watching territory and as a cruising spot for gay sex. Mr. Moffett's pictures convey the tension of not knowing what will happen next, felt in different ways by birders and cruisers alike. A series of pencil drawings titled "Mr. Gay in the U.S.A" is installed in Boesky's second gallery (Cotter).

* JONATHAN PYLYPCHUK, Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467 (through March 1). Cobbled from wood, fur, rags, glue and paint, Mr. Pylypcuk's zany assemblages feature anthropomorphic animals in emotionally fraught situations. Two bird-like creatures with missing legs sit on wheeled palettes wondering, "Now How Will We Get Around?" A broken-legged cat watches a knife fight between another mangy feline and a blocky dwarf. A furry 10-foot-tall tree spewing resin into a fat bird's mouth is a nightmare of co-dependency (Johnson).

JAN STALLER, "Found Sculpture," Klotz/Sirmon, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764 (through March 29). A currently popular form of the photographic sublime is the big picture of an awesome industrial site. Mr. Staller's wide, glossy images of a vast field of plywood boxes, a knitting factory interior, a pile of giant logs with their ends painted blue and marked with red X's are not notably original, but they are formally impressive and romantically engaging (Johnson).

"TOO MUCH FLAVOR," Chambers Fine Art, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 414-1169 (through March 8). This show of seven young Chinese artists is an edited, truncated version of a larger exhibition that appeared in Shanghai and Singapore. Its theme is the consumerist overload that has accompanied a market economy in China, swamping traditional Confucian ideals of a balance between abstemiousness and greed, and harmony between culture and nature (Cotter).

SUSAN WIDES, "Arachnoid," Kim Foster, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 229-0044 (through March 15). A photographer interested in the complicated ways we relate to nature here presents medium-large color pictures of little spiders in the midst of expansive, gossamer webs. The interest is less in the subject matter than in the subtle effects of light, reflection, color, pattern and shifty focus (Johnson).

Other Galleries

"CLAY WORKS: 20TH-CENTURY AMERICAN CERAMICS FROM THE EVERSON MUSEUM OF ART," UBS PaineWebber Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885 (through March 28). Some 60 American ceramic works from the notable collection of the Everson Museum in Syracuse are displayed here, with the focus on the mid- to late 20th century. The show touches on major trends and ceramists, from turn-of-the-century art pottery to innovators like Peter Voulkos and Robert Arneson. A section on utilitarian pottery is cleverly counterpointed by one titled "Utility Trumped," showing works that play with the notion of use but are not really meant for such mundane purposes. If there is a weakness, it is the figural sculpture, which overall seems less substantial than the rest (Glueck).

* CHARLES LeDRAY, Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337 (through March 1). A sculptor known for his miniature men's suits here offers an outfit for a pint-sized mechanic. It has green trousers, a heavy duty jacket, a leather tool belt with little tools and leather gloves, all lovingly handmade. Also on view is a collection of thousands of tiny ceramic pots, each individually formed and glazed; and a black velvet "jewelry display" that has the haunted air of a graveyard (Johnson).

* "THE PARK AVENUE CUBISTS: GALLATIN, MORRIS, FRELINGHUYSEN AND SHAW," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 988-6780 (through March 29). Fueled by family money, four 20th-century artists -- Albert E. Gallatin, Charles G. Shaw, Suzy Frelinghuysen and George L. K. Morris -- enjoyed stylish, Cole Porteresque lives. Colleagues dubbed them the Park Avenue Cubists, but they were also dedicated artists. Although each hewed to an individual style and imagery, they shared a belief that they were the heirs and custodians of European modernism, with Picasso, Braque, Gris and Leger as their models. They recycled Cubist motifs and structures freely long before appropriation became accepted in the art world. Their art got lost for a while in the tide of Abstract Expressionism, but it was too good to be forgotten; in today's retro climate, where originality is not such an issue, their energies shine forth (Glueck).

CLAUDIA SCHMACKE, Plane Space, 102 Charles Street, Greenwich Village, (917) 606-1268 (through March 23). Mesmerizing and somehow slightly comical, this German artist's installation consists of beachball-size snarls of transparent tubing connected to small electrical pumps that circulate greenish-yellow liquid through the system. Ms. Schmacke also offers a series of diverting short videos, close-up, quasi-scientific recordings of watery phenomena like streams, waves, bubbles and whirlpools (Johnson).

"WERE YOU ALL RIGHT YESTERDAY?" White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, entrance on Horatio Street, West Village, (212) 924-4212 (through March 9). Libby McInnis's pair of giant puppets enacting a moment of unspeakable violence is the exception in this otherwise gently beguiling show. Rebecca Westcott makes sensitive portraits of young women; Ben Woodward paints chubby, hairy humanoids; and Kevin Christy, in gouache and ink, and Nils Karsten, in pencil, produce dreamy montages. Jeff Ladouceur's drawings suggest Walt Disney on a bad psychedelic trip and Taylor McKimens's suburban backyard installation features a glum man who looks like a refugee from an R. Crumb comic (Johnson).

Last Chance

LOIS DODD, "Windows and Doorways: Paintings of Three Decades," Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828 (through tomorrow). This survey of work from 1971 through 1992 by a conservative yet uncommonly accomplished painter deals with her recurring motifs of doors and windows, viewed as passages to interior space as well as the outside world. Often preceding, then surviving, the human beings they serve, these simple passages celebrate time and memory as well as the here and now. Celebrating the richness of everyday life, these paintings touch on the transcendental (Glueck).

* "FACING THE MASK," Museum for African Art, third floor, 36-01 43rd Avenue, at 36th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through Sunday). The Museum for African Art, formerly of SoHo, makes the leap to a new home in Long Island City with a very beautiful if surveyish show, "Facing the Mask," which is about moving. Some of the moving is physical, some psychological and spiritual, and it is embodied in more than 70 stunning masks, no two alike, from across sub-Saharan Africa. Some were used for popular entertainment; others were moral forces incarnate. Their purpose was transport, and they are supplemented by films of masquerades in action. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

* "THE FUGITIVES," Riviera, 103 Metropolitan Avenue, at Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, www.seeyouattheriviera.com (through Sunday). This new gallery is the collective project of five artists and designers who have plans to show work as cross-disciplinary as their own. They have started on the right foot with a fine group show of seven artists whose paintings and sculptures incorporate images from comics and advertising, the street and the Web. Travis Millard, Lee Misenheimer, Paul Clark, Niko Stumpo, Scien & Klor, Matt Owens and Rick Froeberg are the names in the international lineup, and there isn't a weak link among them (Cotter).

"THE GIFT: GENEROUS OFFERINGS, THREATENING HOSPITALITY," Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000 (through Sunday). This traveling show has loaded political and social themes about giving, receiving and taking, and a fair amount of interesting art by contemporary figures familiar in New York as well as a passel of youngish Europeans little seen here. It also offers some real gifts -- candy and cotton towels free for the taking; origami sculptures available by barter -- as well as some inhospitable entries, including a doormat that spells out "Welcome" with thousands of upright needles. Hours: Wednesdays, noon to 9 p.m.; Thursdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 65+; free on Wednesdays (Cotter).

"ADOLPH GOTTLIEB: A SURVEY EXHIBITION," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3271 (through Sunday). Gottlieb's painting has not aged as well as that of his colleagues Pollock, Rothko and Newman. His journey leads from 1930's representational pictures that resemble those by his friend Milton Avery to the gridded pictographic works of the 40's to his signature circle-and-burst paintings of the late 50's, which have been his most memorable works. In the 1960's his canvases expand and brighten under the influence of Color Field painting. This 31-painting exhibition casts an illuminating light on a period of tremendous creative ferment in Western art. Hours: Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Mondays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and 65+ (Johnson).

* CHRISTIAN HOLSTAD, "Life Is a Gift," Daniel Reich, 308 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (917) 408-9097 (through today). Functioning like a one-man collective, this talented artist makes his debut with a beautiful plastic-enclosed bedroom inspired by the short life and physical isolation of David Vetter, the bubble boy. It is also an extended commentary on craft and recycling, which includes knitted sculpture, quilting, a linoleum rug, jewellike color-pencil drawings, sweetly pornographic collages and, perhaps best of all, "erased" drawings made from newspaper photographs that create a haunted world inhabited by vulnerable creatures and spirits (Smith).

* "MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY PORTRAITS," Forum Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 355-4545 (through tomorrow). A formidable assemblage of faces has been assembled for this ambitious portrait jam, organized by Townsend Wolfe, former director and chief curator of the Arkansas Art Center in Little Rock. The subjects range from a demure but vivid young thing known as "Mady" (1948) by Alice Neel to the belligerent countenance of the painter Francesco Clemente, seen in a woodcut done by him in 1982. In between are close to 60 others, some quirky and antic and others ultra-traditional (Glueck).

"THE POINTED PEN: WILLIAM SHARP'S COURTROOM DRAWINGS, POLITICAL CARICATURES AND BOOK ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE 1930'S-1950'S," Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park (718) 592-9700 (through Sunday). A wizard with a pen, Sharp (1900-1961), an Austrian-born Jew who satirized Hitler and his followers as they rose to power in the 1920's, fled Germany in 1933 and spent the rest of his life in Forest Hills, Queens. From there, this caricaturist, political cartoonist, courtroom artist, book illustrator and vignettist of urban life took the world as his subject matter, zeroing in on subjects ranging from World War II and the cold war to bums, boxers and baseball players. The more than 250 drawings, etchings and book illustrations here attest to the amazing breadth and engagement of Sharp's work. Part of its charm is the relative innocence of its time and the innocence of Sharp's vision, too, more a journalistic than an artistic one, but nonetheless powerful. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $ 2, students and 55+ (Glueck).

Reason for Hope In Union Talks
 Producers and the musicians' union negotiated again yesterday after an exchange of unpleasantries in dueling news conferences on Tuesday. How much progress was made was uncertain, but though a deal may not be in place by the deadline on Sunday, a full strike was considered unlikely. 
 The main reason for optimism seemed to be a prevailing notion that neither side would benefit from a Broadway shutdown, and that producers are especially vulnerable with a fragile economy and a prospect of war. 
"Nobody can afford it," said one major producer, speaking on condition of anonymity. "The musicians should write a thank you note to George Bush."
The League of American Theaters and Producers, which represents the producers, said that minimums, the set number of musicians at every Broadway musical, remained the fundamental issue. "Everything else revolves around this," said Jed Bernstein, the president of the league. He added that no compromise -- say, a reduction of minimums, not full elimination -- had been offered.
The talks are continuing, but the casts of musicals have started rehearsing with "virtual orchestras," computer programs that simulate the sound of a live orchestra. It isn't always smooth sailing.
Jeffrey Seller, a producer of "La Boheme," confirmed that rehearsals had been slowed by computer tics. "Trying to set tempos with a computer program is a difficult process," Mr. Seller said. "Anytime there's going to be new programs, there's going to be bugs."
Still, like many producers, Mr. Seller tried to be positive. He canceled rehearsals with the computer today in the hope that an agreement was near. "It's an expensive rehearsal," he said, "and I prefer to remain optimistic that they're going to get a deal over the weekend."
Even producers who thought a strike possible expected it to be short. "I don't think they will strike on March 3," one said. "But I think there will be a work action, probably a very short walkout."
For their part, leaders of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians planned on pamphleting theaters this weekend. Shawn Sachs, a spokesman for the union, said reports of computer snafus only hardened their resolve. "Nothing concrete has changed," said Mr. Sachs. "We continue our call to protect live music on Broadway and we believe the public is behind us."

First Biltmore Season
The Manhattan Theater Club has settled on the three shows that will play at its new Broadway home, the renovated Biltmore Theater (price tag: $35 million) on West 47th Street.
Surprisingly, the first Biltmore season will not include a play by Terrance McNally, who has been closely associated with the group for many years. Mr. McNally's new play, the first act of which had a recent reading, is not ready for production, a theater spokesman said. Instead the Biltmore's premiere production will be by another regular: Richard Greenberg, the prolific playwright whose drama "Take Me Out" opened on Broadway last night. (Review, Page 3.) Mr. Greenberg's newest one is "The Violet Hour," a drama about a young publisher and a mysterious machine, which will open at the Biltmore in October.
That will be followed by "Drowning Crow," Regina Taylor's adaptation of "The Sea Gull" by Chekhov, which, like its source material, follows the travails of a group of artists on retreat. The Biltmore's inaugural year will end with a revival of "Sight Unseen," Donald Margulies's dark comedy about a fashionable painter and his unsettled past. The play, a hit for Manhattan Theater Club in 1992, will arrive on Broadway next spring.

Three Shows Moving
You have to hand it to them: Off Broadway producers are nothing if not optimistic. Despite a rough season so far, three current shows announced transfers this week to longer runs. The biggest upgrade is "Hank Williams: Lost Highway," which will transfer from the Manhattan Ensemble Theater in SoHo to the new Little Shubert Theater on West 42nd Street. The show, a sell-out at the 140-seat theater downtown, will be looking to fill all of the Li'l Shub's 499 seats. Performances begin March 25.
"The Blacks," which has been drawing crowds to the Classical Theater of Harlem for a month, will head downtown to the home of Classic Stage Company, on East 13th Street, on March 11 for a four-week run. It is the four-year-old nonprofit troupe's first transfer. Also moving is Jonathan Tolins's "Last Sunday in June," a Rattlestick Theater production that will transfer to the Century Center for the Performing Arts off Union Square after its run at 224 Waverly Place in Greenwich Village ends in March.

Humor in Letters
For those who came of age after the McCarthy era and don't have a degree in film, the name Dalton Trumbo may mean little. So a quick primer: he was a big-time Hollywood screenwriter whose career was interrupted when he was subpoenaed in 1947 -- as one of the Hollywood 10 -- to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities to testify about his political beliefs. Refusing to name names, Trumbo spent a year in prison in 1950 and the next decade in blacklisted exile before returning to write such seminal movies as "Spartacus" and "Papillon." He died in 1976.
Trumbo was also, as it turns out, an avid and witty letter writer. Beginning March 31, those letters will form the backbone of a new theater piece, "Trumbo," which has attracted four big-name Hollywood stars -- Ed Harris, Tim Robbins, Richard Dreyfuss and Chris Cooper -- to do one-night stands in the show. The piece, assembled by Trumbo's son Christopher, will play Mondays only at the Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street. Proceeds will benefit People for the American Way, a civil liberties group.
Mr. Harris, who is flying in for the day from his home in Los Angeles, said the decision was simple. "It's about something important: it's about free speech," he said. "And it's actually pretty funny, too."

Family Resorts: Part Idyll, Part Survival Test

BYLINE:  By NANCY M. BETTER 

 BODY:
AT 5 p.m. the day after Christmas, my family arrived at the Grand Wailea Hotel on Maui, bleary-eyed from flying to Hawaii, halfway around the world from our home in Connecticut. Outside, white-uniformed porters scurried around with overloaded trolleys of luggage; inside, the gleaming marble lobby was teeming with people. While waiting to check in, we noticed a curious phenomenon: everyone, staff members and guests alike, seemed to be carrying walkie-talkies.
 It did not take long to figure out why. The Grand Wailea has 40 acres, 780 rooms, 6 restaurants and 5 bars, and it is easy to get lost on its lushly manicured grounds. Bewildered newcomers can be spotted checking their maps. It took us three days to find the quickest route to the beach; it involved two elevators, one flight of stairs and a quarter-mile hike. 
 I wish we had known to bring along walkie-talkies, but then, I wish we had known lots of things about our dream vacation before booking it 15 months earlier. (The hotel recommends making peak-season reservations at least a year in advance.) 
This was our first visit to an action-packed mega-resort, aside from Walt Disney World. Our friends raved about these places, and our children begged to go. Their classmates would come home from the holidays sporting cool plastic wristbands, each a different color signifying the length of their stay at places like the Grand Wailea or the Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas. They would boast of towering water slides and thundering whitewater rapids.
We had also been hearing about a major renovation at the venerable Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla., that made it a magnet for families. Paul Leone, the president of the Breakers, said the resort's management decided a decade ago to make the property less formal, to capitalize on the fast-growing market for upscale family travel. 
So when we realized we had enough frequent flyer miles to justify taking a family of five (two adults and three children, aged 10, 8 and 6) 5,000 miles, we decided to take the plunge. We chose the Grand Wailea not for its three championship golf courses or its award-winning spa but for its spectacular waterworks. Since 1991, the hotel has lavished more than $25 million on a high-tech network of nine pools, including a one-of-a-kind water elevator. We envisioned ourselves lounging on the beach while the children frolicked in this aquatic theme park.
But we soon discovered that a successful trip to a mega-resort like the Grand Wailea requires survival of the fittest. During peak season (roughly mid-November to April), nearly every pool chaise is draped in towels by the crack of dawn, all aerobic machines in the gym are occupied by 8 a.m., every restaurant is heavily booked months in advance, and the steady stream of surcharges threatens to send an already expensive vacation into the financial stratosphere.
In the end, we managed to make the most of our trip, and the children had a ball. And if we ever go back to one of these mega-resorts, we will go armed with knowledge earned the hard way. Consider these the Rules of the Jungle, 10 things every parent should know before booking such a trip.

1. Children Stay Free?
It all depends on how you define "free." Yes, children 17 and under can stay at no charge in their parents' rooms at the Grand Wailea. But other incidental costs can mount up fast. Book a pair of adjoining rooms, and you are charged a connecting fee of $30 a night. If two of your children refuse to sleep together, you will need to add a cot for $25 a night. Throw in a refrigerator rental -- so you can leave the $5 sodas locked up in the mini-bar -- for $25, plus taxes on all these extras, and you will find an extra $400 tacked onto your final bill. (The Grand Wailea has a six-night minimum stay during peak season.)
At the Atlantis, the charge for children 12 and older who stay in their parents' rooms is $45 a night per child. To encourage them to stay next door, the resort can guarantee adjoining rooms and does not charge a connecting fee.
The Breakers allows children 16 and under to stay in their parents' rooms at no charge; cots are free but must be requested before arrival.

2. Location, Location, Location
The huge Atlantis Paradise Island resort has 11 swimming areas, a 50,000-square-foot casino, a full-service spa, an 18-hole golf course, 10 tennis courts, a shopping mall and a conference center. Waterways filled with sharks, tropical fish and stingrays course throughout the 34-acre property.
Upon booking, guests are sent a CD-ROM with an interactive resort map; practice in tracing routes presumably helps prevent disorientation upon arrival. Atlantis veterans offer one piece of advice: Choose your accommodations carefully. With 2,317 rooms, some guests are housed so far from the main pool area that they need to travel by shuttle bus.
"You have to request the Royal Towers, because it is closest to the action," said Victoria Stafford, who lives in Fairfield County, Conn., and has four young children. "You also have to be prepared to chase your kids around, because it's hard to keep track of them."
At the Grand Wailea, we stayed in the Molokini Wing, which is farthest from the pools and beach but closest to the shopping mall and golf courses. We were assigned this location because it was available; this turned out to be a good thing because this is the quiet side of the hotel, a boon during the all-night New Year's Eve beach party.

3. Don't Be Captive to Crowds
If the hectic scene at the Atlantis threatens to ruin your sanity, there is another option: stay at the nearby Ocean Club, a more tranquil, secluded and intimate hotel (with only 106 rooms) owned by the same company.
Marlene Baum, a New York mother of two, recommends this strategy. "The Ocean Club is lovely and civilized, with wonderful service," she said. "We stay there, and then take our kids to Atlantis for lunch and a couple of hours in the pools."
Shuttles between the two resorts operate continuously, or you can take a 15-minute stroll down the shared beach.

4. Early Birds Get the Chaise
The Breakers, a palatial Italian villa built in 1896, is far from the carnival atmosphere of the island resorts, although its offerings are comprehensive: 560 rooms, 4 pools, 2 18-hole golf courses and a 20,000-square-foot spa.
The environment at the Breakers may be elegant -- croquet and horseshoes are popular activities -- but beneath the genteel Gatsbyesque veneer, guests have to hustle for everything.
One New York executive recruiter who asked that her name not be used to protect her privacy raced down to the pool at 6:45 each morning to claim chaises in a certain spot. "I like the first-come, first-served system," she said. "One year we went to the Four Seasons on Nevis, and they assigned us chairs for the whole week. We arrived on Dec. 27th and got horrible chairs. Everyone else had been there since before Christmas. It wasn't until after New Year's that we finally got decent chairs."

5. High-Priced Child's Play
Children's programs can make golf lessons and spa treatments look cheap.
At the Breakers' Coconut Crew Interactive Camp, children aged 3 to 12 pay $70 for a six-hour day. In addition to tennis, golf, soccer and swimming, the camp features the Secret Garden, a 1,200-foot-long hedge maze, and a beachfront playground.
For $75 a day at the Grand Wailea's Camp Grande, children can be entertained with swimming, scavenger hunts, and arts and crafts, along with Hawaiian specialties like hula dancing, ukulele lessons and lei making. Teenage guests can work as C.I.T.'s (counselors in training), paying $15 and $25 for the privilege of assisting Camp Grande's staff.
Of course, many children (mine included) will forgo camp in favor of hanging out at a big resort's bustling waterfront. At the Grand Wailea, boogie boards and kayaks can be rented by the hour ($5 for the boards, $15 and $25 for the kayaks, depending on the size). Our children begged for surfing lessons ($59 for 90 minutes) and windsurfing lessons ($69 for 90 minutes). Even bouncing on the water trampoline anchored in the ocean cost $10 per child.

6. Plan Ahead or Lose Out
Upon our arrival at the Grand Wailea, we asked the concierge about a reservation at the resort's Japanese restaurant. "Tonight?" she responded, incredulous. We then inquired about signing up for massages the next afternoon. She explained, with more than a hint of impatience in her voice, that there were no openings available for the next two weeks.
"Your trip will go a lot more smoothly if you plan in advance," said Neesha Lahiri, marketing coordinator for the Grand Wailea. She recommends making reservations for meals, as well as spa treatments, day camp and child care, several weeks in advance of a visit.
(If you find yourself shut out, refuse to take no for an answer, at least from the resort's concierge. Eager to visit the Old Lahaina Luau, a Maui attraction, we asked the concierge for assistance. She immediately informed us that it was fully booked throughout our stay. We called the luau directly and found it had had a cancellation for the following evening.)

7. Repeaters Know the Ropes
On our first day at the Grand Wailea we ran into some hometown friends who make an annual pilgrimage to the hotel. They proved invaluable in helping us navigate around the resort. They suggested that we skip the extravagant buffet breakfast ($23.50 for adults, $11.75 for children 5 to 12) in favor of a coffee shop in the mall next door. And they recommended that we stop using the resort's slow-moving valet service and opt for self-parking in a nearby garage.
We still had to pay the valet fee (it is a mandatory charge added to each room bill), but at least we avoided a long wait for our car each day.

8. Meal-Plan Prisoners
The Atlantis suggests that guests 12 and older buy dining plans. Children 4 and under are free, but only when their parents dine at the same time. That means adding lots of $15 grilled-cheese sandwiches to your room-service bill if you leave the children behind with a baby sitter.
The resort's Modified American Plan ($55 per adult per day, $30 per child per day) offers breakfast in four restaurants and dinner in six restaurants. Want to upgrade to the Gourmet Dining Plan ($79 per adult per day, $41 per child per day) with breakfast in five restaurants and dinner in 13 restaurants? You are out of luck; this plan cannot be bought at the resort.
"We require advance booking for this plan because it helps us schedule accordingly at our more expensive restaurants," said Ashley McBain, a spokeswoman for the resort. "We recommend that guests choose a meal plan, because it ends up being more economical, for both adults and children." A 15 percent mandatory tip is automatically added at each meal.

9. Takeout Options
One second-generation Breakers guest from Westchester County says she and her family like the resort but not the food. So she orders sandwiches and salads from a local deli and picks them up at the front desk. She also requests doggy bags when dining at Palm Beach's top restaurants and asks the kitchen staff to heat up leftovers for her children's dinner.
Mr. Leone, the Breakers president, acknowledges that "lunchtime can be challenging for families during the busy season." Over this past Presidents' Day weekend, his staff set up an extra 100-seat cafe on the beach to ease crowding and provide quick service. "It was costly, but we have to provide the necessary resources for peak periods," he said. He added that the Breakers recently opened a casual, family-style Italian restaurant adjacent to its family entertainment center.

10. Well-Padded Totals
On top of taxes and mandatory tips, the Grand Wailea charges a resort service fee of $15 a day per room. This covers the valet parking, a lei for each arriving guest and other odds and ends. At the Atlantis, adults (including children 12 and over) pay a $7 daily surcharge for utilities and housekeeping tips.

The Bottom Line
"You and your family can have a blast, but you have to realize that you are going to pay five-star resort prices for a place that's a lot like Disney World," said Ms. Stafford, the Fairfield mother of four. "If you have that mind-set, you won't be disappointed."

HEADLINE: Ending Its Mega-Run, 'Les Miz' Comes Full Circle 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
TERRENCE MANN was the first Inspector Javert in the Broadway production of "Les Miserables." Now, 16 years later, he has come back to be the last.
 On May 18 this blockbuster version of the Victor Hugo novel that helped define the mega-musical of the 1980's will go dark at the Imperial Theater, taking its place in the record books as the second longest-running Broadway show of all time, after "Cats." 
 While people on Broadway who do eight shows a week usually look at each night as just one taxing performance more, these days the cast and crew of "Les Miserables" look at each night as one treasured performance less.
One show less for Carmel Vargyas, the hair and makeup supervisor, to comb and tease the graying ponytail wig that the villainous Javert wears as he pursues the big-hearted fugitive Jean Valjean. One show less for the men in the cast to gather in a circle onstage for a bonding game of hacky sack -- keeping a beanbag in the air with various body parts -- just before curtain time. One show less for Ron Fedeli, the head carpenter, to test the turntable on which the bloodied barricades revolve in battle. One show less for the actors to lie onstage together in the dark, pretending to sleep as they listen to the wrenching ballad "Bring Him Home." 
With the closing of "Cats" in September 2000 and of "Miss Saigon" in January 2001, the closing of "Les Miz" inevitably seems heavy with symbolism, like the end of an era. This leaves "The Phantom of the Opera" as the last remaining big British import, which will soon become the third longest-running show in Broadway history.
"It's a loss to the skyline of Broadway," said Nick Wyman, who has played Thenardier, the jovial, self-interested innkeeper in "Les Miz," since the show's 10th anniversary in 1997.
Mr. Mann said the end of "Les Miz" signaled the beginning of a new chapter in musical theater.
"I don't think we'll see mega-musicals anymore," he said. "I don't think we'll see things run 12 years, 9 years, 5 years. Even if you take 9/11 out of the equation, the economics make it difficult.
"As in all areas of theater and art, there are cycles, and now we're in a cycle when we have to figure out what the next genre is. It always happens after wars or tragedy."
Directed by Trevor Nunn and John Caird, "Les Miz" won eight Tony Awards in 1987, including best musical. By the time it closes, the Broadway show will have been seen by more than nine million people and grossed more than $400 million at the box office, employed 421 actors and 1,633 support staff members and fathered 53 productions in 38 countries in 21 languages.
The production in London, where the musical started in 1985, is still running.
Cameron Mackintosh, the show's producer, said of it: "I thought it would last two or three years. I thought it might be another serious musical like 'Evita.' I had no idea it would sail past 'The Sound of Music.' "
Mr. Mann came back to the show at the request of Mr. Mackintosh, who also created "Phantom," "Miss Saigon" and "Cats," in which Mr. Mann originated the role of Rum Tum Tugger on Broadway.
Mr. Mann said "Les Miz" was the more momentous musical. "This epic story of man's indomitability and redemption," he said, "was even bigger than 'Cats.' "
Being present at the arrival of "Les Miz," experiencing its impact firsthand, was both uplifting and burdensome. "It was overwhelming," Mr. Mann said. "My reaction to it all was: 'Oh, my gosh, there's so much to live up to.' The pressure of this being the seminal piece of musical theater for the century.
"There was 'Showboat' in the 20's, which turned a corner. Then there was 'Oklahoma!' and then this. The pressure made it difficult to enjoy sometimes."
Mr. Mann said he returned to close out "Les Miz" more for selfish than sentimental reasons. He was in the show for eight months the first time around, leaving to do two movies, "Critters 2: The Main Course" and "Big Top Pee-wee."
He wanted another shot at the role, a chance to do it better with the benefit of age and experience. "When I was 36 and doing the show, I was just running on youthful adrenaline," he said. "Now I'm 51 and trying to find a way to enjoy doing eight shows a week."
(Mr. Mann never went back to "Cats." "You can only fit into that spandex once in your life," he said.)
So far, Mr. Mann said, he could describe the experience only as strange. "It feels incredibly familiar and incredibly unfamiliar, all at the same time," he said.
"It's hard not to just drop back into the slot of the way I did it -- perceived it -- before," he continued. "That's the hardest thing, to make it new."
To prepare, he said, he listened to the original Broadway recording (featuring him), saw the show about four times and went into rehearsal. "By the end of that first rehearsal, I knew 85 percent of the show again," he said. "It kind of just came back into me."

A Rite of Passage
There are those who never left and those who have come and gone. Mr. Wyman, the innkeeper, described "Les Miz" as a rite of passage for actors. "When I came into the city, it was 'Godspell' or 'Grease,' and everyone passed through one of those two shows," he said. "Now everyone comes through 'Les Miz,' either Broadway or the road."
Over his decade in the show, Mr. Wyman has seen many cast members come and go. "I've had three different wives," he said, "each one wonderful."
Like many associated with "Les Miz," Mr. Wyman said it was the substance of the musical that held his interest after all these years, with its themes of love and destruction and second chances. The show, which depicts the French student uprisings of 1832 and the years leading up to them, features music by Claude-Michel Schonberg and lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer, with original French text by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel and additional material by James Fenton.
"It's one of the most amazing messages of redemption," Mr. Wyman said. "It also hammers away at the idea of parenthood -- fathers and daughters, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons."
Mr. Wyman pointed to the song "Bring Him Home," in which Valjean sings affectingly about Marius, who isn't even his son. "For anyone who has children, it's very moving," Mr. Wyman said.
"Les Miz" has helped Mr. Wyman support his three children in a career that has also included teaching, television and films like "Die Hard With a Vengeance."
"You cobble together your living from all sorts of sources," Mr. Wyman said. "It has been wonderful to have a steady commitment."
Because of the show's weighty themes, Mr. Wyman said, he was also grateful to be the one who supplies some of the show's few lighter moments, like the song, "Master of the House."
"I am blessed with having the best role," he said. "In the midst of torment, there is one bright ray of comic sunshine and that's me."
Mr. Wyman is one of the men who play hacky sack before the show. Legend has it that this "Les Miz" preshow tradition was established by Glenn Calhoun, a former prop man. The actors said the game creates a sense of camaraderie and could be a metaphor for the democratic nature of the production.
"I've done 'Phantom' and 'Les Miz,' " Mr. Wyman said. "In 'Phantom,' you've got singers and dancers and featured roles and stars. Here we are together. We are field hands and convicts. We all start off together as members of the ensemble."

Keeping Interest Up
This ensemble quality started with the show's beginning at the Royal Shakespeare Company's Barbican Theater in London in October 1985. "Les Miz" transferred to the Palace Theater in the West End in December 1985. It then tried out at the Kennedy Center in Washington in 1986 and moved to Broadway in 1987, starting at the Broadway Theater and moving to the Imperial in 1990.
Ms. Vargyas, the hair and makeup supervisor, has worked on long-running shows before, but nothing compares to "Les Miz," where she has worked since 1988. She did the 1987 revival of "Cabaret" for a couple of years but quickly grew tired of it. "After six weeks I said, 'I can't listen to this music one more time,' " she said. "But here, I'm not there yet.
"There's an emotional attachment to the show that has been like no other, so I have not thought about leaving. I am now."
The crew members seem to be looking for work only halfheartedly. They are in no rush. They know something this solid and this satisfying is unlikely to come along again.
"I've loved every minute," said Gregg N. Kirsopp, the production stage manager, who has been with the show more than 11 years. "I've had opportunities to go do some other things. This is just a great, powerful story, and I love working with these people."
"It's just a wonderful message that we're putting out there," he continued. "That there is good in all."
Mr. Kirsopp can chart the development of his family by the run of "Les Miz." His wife was a production stage manager on the show before him, though they were married before "Les Miz" began. Their son, 7, saw the show two years ago. "He wants to see it again before it closes," Mr. Kirsopp said. "He'll probably understand a lot more of it now."
Similarly, Mr. Fedeli, the head carpenter, has seen his children grow up with "Les Miz." When he started on the show in 1987, his oldest son was 18 months old. He will be 17 by the time the show closes.
"This has been a tremendous job opportunity," Mr. Fedeli said. "I also look at it as a time to move on to whatever is next."
He doesn't know what's next but assumes it will be another Broadway show. The business runs in his blood. Mr. Fedeli's grandfather and father were stagehands. His brothers are, too. He met his wife, a former stage manager, on "Evita." They were married in 1989.
Mr. Fedeli started on "Les Miz" as the automation man, or turntable operator, and worked his way up to head carpenter. Running the turntable may not seem like much, but in "Les Miz" it is essential, moving actors and scenery on and off stage, intensifying the drama of the show by its rapid revolutions.

The Compliment of Parody
It has also been a ripe target for parody, as evidenced by the long-running spoof "Forbidden Broadway," which has a "Les Miz" number featuring actors constantly rotating as they sing to the tune of "At the End of the Day":
At the end of the play
We're another year older
And we're often exhausted from playing the poor
Enjolras fell in the band
And the turntable's making us dizzy
Trevor Nunn yells a command
And he's throwing us all in a tizzy
And there's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the play!
Despite the ridicule, Mr. Mann said he never felt the need to apologize for the show. "I think anything that becomes caricatured, satirized certainly has to have some validity," he said. "You can't make fun of something unless people have taken it seriously. That is the essence of satire."
Gerard Alessandrini, the creator of "Forbidden Broadway," said he would miss "Les Miz." "It's probably one of the most spoofable shows because it's so grand and has all those miserable characters," he said.
Toward the end of the show's run, Mr. Alessandrini said, he plans to put together a special version of "Forbidden Broadway" consisting of all his "Les Miz" numbers. He has created a new one each year. Already "Forbidden Broadway" has been performing a countdown to the closing of "Les Miz" that takes off on the show's song "One Day More." It is called "Three Months More" and will eventually become "Two Months More" and so on. "The day before the show closes," Mr. Alessandrini said, "it won't be a spoof anymore."
A sample:
Soon we'll close and please each rival
But "Les Miz" fans quell your fears
We'll be back as a revival
That will run for 40 years.
For Randal Keith, the end of "Les Miz" is a beginning. For years he has been hoping to play Valjean on Broadway. Since 1997 he has performed the part in Shanghai, Korea, Toronto and across the United States. Now he is finally getting his shot at it. Mr. Mackintosh brought him in to replace J. Mark McVey as Valjean after the original star, Colm Wilkinson, could not do it because of a family illness. But Mr. Keith's Broadway debut will last all of 12 weeks. Still, Mr. Keith said he was grateful for it. Better a brief Broadway run than no Broadway run at all. "It's something I've been waiting for," he said.
"I think it's one of the most vocally demanding roles I've ever had," he added. "Three hours of solid singing takes a lot out of you."

Filling the Downtime
At three hours, the show is epic in scope, and many members of the cast and crew have patches of downtime. In the wings the actors stretch, whisper or sit quietly while they wait to go on. In the basement they play cards, touch up their makeup and chat in their white terry cloth "Les Miserables" robes. Their lockers are decorated with family photos and clippings. They brush their teeth side by side at the sink. It feels like a fraternity.
The actors have their private jokes, even onstage. At one point in the show, David McDonald, who has been with "Les Miz" on and off since 1995, and two of his fellow actors sing three-part harmony under their breath behind the barricade. It's a song they sing for themselves. "It's beautiful, actually," Mr. McDonald said. "Too bad the audience can't hear it."
In the wardrobe department where Adelaide Laurino presides among the washing machines, there is a stack of videotapes piled next to a small television, with titles like "Working Girl," "Small Time Crooks" and "Get Shorty."
"It's a chicken coop is what it is," Ms. Laurino said of the cramped underground space where she is surrounded by clothes to be laundered, pressed or mended.
The stage manager's office near the stage door has become a gathering place. Regular contests are conducted there: best hair, most changed, most likely to . . . Cast members bring in photographs of themselves and cast their ballots. The entries are posted on the wall.

The Children Play Games
The children in the show are considerably more creative with their time offstage. There are five in the show; the girls alternate performances of young Cosette and young Eponine, the boys play Gavroche. Many of them are offstage from intermission until the curtain call. Jim Cleveland, chaperone for the last 14 years, helps them find activities, assists with homework, arbitrates disputes.
But the children are rarely at loose ends. Over the years they have developed a rich fantasy world.Their make-believe games include apartment, streets, puppies, orphanage, business, jail and college. They keep a box full of dress-up clothes. "We pretend we are in a battle," said Christiana Anbri, 12, who has been in the show four years. "I look forward to coming here. I say to myself, 'One more hour till I go to the theater.' "
Alexandra Rose Sullivan, 9, who joined the show last year, said, "These are my best friends here."
The longer they stay, the children say, the more attached they become to the production and to one another. In addition to Christiana and Alexandra, the group currently includes Andrew Hoeft, Nicholas Jonas and Kristin Danielle Klabunde.
"I've seen 14 Gavroches and 15 Cosettes leave," Christiana said. "There were a few kids I got really close to."
When Mr. Cleveland talked about the children who have come and gone, tears rolled down his cheeks. He says it is hard to imagine doing something else after so many years of doing this. "I was a teacher before," he said. "I stayed because of the kids."
Over the years, most of the 87 children who have been in "Les Miz" have left because they outgrew their roles. Now the show is leaving them. "I'm really sad, but I'm also happy I'm not leaving because I'm too big or something," Christiana said. "I'm leaving with the whole entire company."

The Last Words
Certainly "Les Miz" has had its rough patches. There was the time in 1996 when Mr. Mackintosh replaced much of the cast after deciding that the production had grown stale.
But on the whole, those who have been associated with "Les Miz" feel that they have helped make Broadway history. "It's such an honor to be a part of it," said Edward Juvier, who plays Joly and has been in the show on and off since 2000. "Many people joined theater because of the show. I did. I saw it in this theater. I remember the exact seat I was sitting in."
Inevitably, members of the cast and crew said, the final days in May will be emotional. "I'm sure everyone's going to be walking around in tears," Ms. Vargyas said. "It's not a shock that it's closing. It's been coming for a while. But it will be an adjustment. A big adjustment."
Everything will take on a new meaning, particularly the lyrics. Like "Drink with me to days gone by/Sing with me the songs we knew" and the show's final words that on closing night will bring "Les Miserables" to an end:
Will you join in our crusade
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes.

Final Days
"Les Miserables" is at the Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Performances are Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85. This musical is scheduled to close on May 18.

Shares Rally After Government Reduces Terrorism Alert

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Relieved that the government lowered the national terror alert level and heartened by a report that Iraq would destroy some missiles, investors pushed shares higher yesterday, reversing much of the previous session's big sell-off.
 Positive economic news -- a report of an unexpectedly strong increase in orders to factories for big-ticket items -- also fed the advance. 
 Still, analysts remained dubious about chances for a sustained upward trend in the face of war fears. 
"Until this Iraq situation is resolved, the market is always going to be running the risk of getting into this war without knowing what it means" to the economy, Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee, said. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 78.01 points, or 1 percent, at 7,884.99, recovering much of Wednesday's loss of 102.52 points. 
The broader market also rallied. The Nasdaq composite index rose 20.28 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,323.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.73 points, or 1.2 percent, to 837.28.
Wall Street seemed encouraged by reports that the Bush administration was lowering the terror alert level to yellow from orange, the second-highest status, suggesting that the threat of a terrorist attack had eased. 
The market also took heart from a report by Egypt's news agency that Iraq would announce later in the day that it would comply with a United Nations order to begin destroying its Samoud 2 missiles by the weekend. But no such comment came from the Iraqi government.
Also yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that orders to factories for durable goods rose 3.3 percent in January, the best showing in six months.
Still, analysts doubted the market's ability to sustain any gains, expecting investors to hold back until it is clearer if and when there will be a war and what effect it will have on the economy. 
"Any up day is a good day these days, but I am not giving it too much weight," said Gary Kaltbaum, market technician for Investors' Edge Partners in Orlando, Fla. "There is still a lot of work to be done in this market. It is still trying to hammer out a low."
Shares of major manufacturers closed higher on the durable goods report. DaimlerChrysler rose 73 cents, to $30.07, while Maytag advanced 61 cents, to $24.11.
Better-than-anticipated earnings and brokerage house upgradings gave other stocks a lift. The PG&E Corporation, the energy company, rose 42 cents, to $13.19, on fourth-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share.
Darden Restaurants, which operates the Red Lobster and Olive Garden chains, rose $1.05, to $17.85, after J. P. Morgan raised its rating to overweight from neutral. 
But Wall Street was disappointed by a report from the Commerce Department that showed that sales of new homes plunged 15.1 percent last month after a 4.1 percent increase in December. Investors sold off home builders, including Centex, which closed down 17 cents, at $55.56. 
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note increased 9/32, to a price of 101 5/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.74 percent from 3.77 percent. 
The 30-year bond increased 11/32, to 110 5/32. Its yield fell to 4.72 percent from 4.74 percent.

HEADLINE: Economic Data Point in Both Directions 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Sales of new homes plunged in January at the fastest pace in nine years, while orders for durable goods posted the biggest rise in six months, reports from the Commerce Department indicated today. 
 The sale of new single-family homes fell to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 914,000, a 15.1 percent drop from December, when sales reached a record monthly level. 
 The performance, much weaker than analysts had expected, represented the worst single month for new-home sales since January 1994, and, economists said, raised some new questions about consumers' willingness to make big financial commitments amid worries about a war in Iraq. Other economists, minimizing the importance of the decrease, cited the cold weather and seasonal distortions. 
Still, "you can't dismiss sales being off by 15 percent," said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "I think we are seeing more caution." 
Home sales fell sharply in all parts of the country, except the Northeast, where they rose. Sales in the Midwest dropped 42.2 percent in January, to a pace of 163,000. In the South, sales fell 12.9 percent, to 406,000, and in the West, they dipped 1.4 percent, to a pace of 279,000. But in the Northeast, sales rose 43.5 percent, to a pace of 66,000. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said orders to factories for durable goods, relatively costly items expected to last at least three years, rose 3.3 percent in January. The increase came after orders fell 0.4 percent in December and 1.2 percent in November. 
It surpassed the 1 percent advance that economists had predicted and was the strongest performance since July. 
The gains were broad based. Orders for transportation products rose 5.1 percent in January, in contrast to December's 3.5 percent decline. 
Orders for automobiles increased 10.7 percent, the largest increase since April, and a turnaround from a 5.9 percent drop in December. 
Excluding orders for transportation products, which can swing widely from month to month, orders for durable goods rose 2.5 percent in January. 
Orders for computers rose 1.5 percent, down from a 10.4 percent advance in December. For communications equipment, orders soared 46.1 percent, more than erasing a 15.8 percent decline in December. 
Machinery orders rose 5.3 percent, after dropping 1 percent. Orders for primary metals, including steel, grew 4.2 percent, after a 2.6 percent rise.
In still another report, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment benefits rose by a seasonally adjusted 11,000 last week, to 417,000, a two-month high, suggesting that businesses were inclined to keep work forces lean.
The four-week moving average, which irons out some weekly fluctuations, also rose, to 399,750, from 395,750 the previous week.

HEADLINE: Gap's Results Meet Analysts' Expectations 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Gap Inc. delivered today the fourth-quarter earnings comeback that management had promised, but warned that its performance this month was not living up to expectations. 
 The company, which is based in San Francisco, earned $248.7 million, or 27 cents a share, in the three months ended Feb. 1 in contrast to a loss of $34.2 million, or 4 cents, in the fourth quarter a year earlier. 
 The results matched the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Analysts raised the average estimate from 16 cents at the beginning of the month after the company advised that its fourth-quarter profit would range from 23 cents to 29 cents a share. 
Fourth-quarter sales were $4.65 billion, a 14 percent increase from the period a year earlier. Sales at stores open more than a year, a common measure of a retailer's health, rose 8 percent in the quarter. 
The gains reflected a back-to-basics approach Gap adopted in the middle of last year to lure back consumers alienated by selections that emphasized more eclectic fashions. 
The approach helped Gap end 29 consecutive months of sliding sales shortly after a new chief executive, Paul Pressler, replaced its chief, Millard S. Drexler, in September. 
While Gap's February sales at stores open more than a year have been higher than a year ago, the performance was short of management's projections, said Byron Pollitt, the chief financial officer. 
Sagging consumer confidence and poor weather have hurt February sales, Mr. Pollitt said, but "other reasons for this shortfall are difficult to read."

HEADLINE: No Relief in Sight 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
So Glenn Hubbard has resigned as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers -- to spend more time with his family, of course. (Pay no attention to the knife handles protruding from his back.) Gregory Mankiw, his successor, is a very good economist, but never mind: When the political apparatchiks who make all decisions in this administration want Mr. Mankiw's opinion, they'll tell Mr. Mankiw what it is.
 Meanwhile consumer confidence is plunging, and almost two-thirds of voters rate the current state of the economy as "poor." Is there any relief in sight? No. 
 The conventional wisdom among business forecasters now calls for growth of a bit more than 3 percent over the next year. Growth at that pace is barely enough to keep up with rising productivity and an expanding labor force, not enough to make a serious dent in unemployment. And a growing number of forecasters think the conventional wisdom is overoptimistic, that the pain is about to get even worse. 
One reason is the surge in oil prices, which acts like a big tax increase, siphoning off spending that might otherwise have helped create jobs. And forget about those cheerful predictions of cheap oil as soon as Saddam is gone. Yes, oil prices plunged after the 1991 gulf war; but as Philip Verleger of the Council on Foreign Relations points out, back then there were big inventories of oil that got dumped once the crisis was past; this time inventories are very low. And if the victory isn't as quick and easy as promised, or if the aftermath of war is as nasty as many fear, oil prices could easily go much higher.
Then there's the effect of the worst fiscal crisis in the 50 states since World War II. Iris Lav of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggests that tax increases and spending cuts at the state level could drain $100 billion from the national economy over the next year. Aid from Washington is an obvious answer -- but the Bush administration refuses to provide a penny.
Finally, the increasingly grim mood of consumers can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If disheartened families cut their spending, the job picture will worsen even further. 
So where's the upside? To be fair, there are some reasons for hope. Most notably, after two years of low business investment, there's presumably a pent-up demand for new equipment. As I understand it, the prevailing view at the Federal Reserve -- which is considerably more optimistic than private forecasters -- is that once war fears are behind us, business investment will surge, and all will be well with the economy. Sounds like wishful thinking to me, but let's hope they're right. Also, war itself can be an economic stimulus, as the Pentagon replenishes the munitions it uses up in Iraq.
But you don't have to be a doomsayer to feel that the negatives greatly outweigh the positives -- that an economy that is already hurting badly is all too likely to get even worse. So what will the administration do about it? Nothing, of course.
Yes, I know, the Bush team is proposing about $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. But when pressed, administration officials admit that their plan will do little for the economy right now. Why? Because those are long-term cuts; only a tiny fraction of the total will flow into people's pockets this year. Furthermore, most of the tax cuts will -- of course -- go to affluent families, who will probably save most of the money.
Why is the administration so uninterested in helping the economy? Here's my theory: The depressed state of the economy provides a convenient if bogus rationale for the huge, extremely irresponsible long-run tax cuts that, after Iraq, constitute this administration's principal obsession. To do anything else to help the economy would suggest that it's possible to create jobs now without putting the country's future solvency at risk -- and that's not a message this administration wants to convey. 
I almost feel sorry for Mr. Mankiw, who I suspect has no idea what he's getting into; I'm sure he will soon feel frustrated over his inability to have any real influence on this disastrous policy. But on second thought I'll save my sympathy for the two million people who have lost their jobs over the past two years, and are not likely to find new ones any time soon.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeking Cleaner Model Of Coal Plant 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
The Energy Department yesterday announced plans to build an experimental power plant within 10 years that runs on coal but emits no carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping greenhouse gas that makes coal plants major contributors to global warming.
 The project, called FutureGen, is considered a first step toward creating a generation of coal-fueled power plants that emit no greenhouse gases and cost no more than 10 percent extra to run, department officials said. 
 The technology is essential, said Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, if the vast coal reserves in the United States and in many developing countries are to be used without adding to the atmosphere's burden of greenhouse gases.
Coal-fueled plants now produce about 40 percent of the roughly 23 billion tons of carbon dioxide humans release into the atmosphere each year, and coal is still considered a vital underpinning of economic development, here and overseas. 
"There is no doubt coal is going to be a principal fuel source in the 21st century," Mr. Abraham said. The project, he said, "will help turn coal from an environmentally challenging energy resource into an environmentally benign one."
The $1 billion cost of the pilot project over the next 10 years would be shared by the United States, other countries and private companies, although no partners have been enlisted, officials said. The outlines of the plan were described yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. 
Mr. Abraham said that the administration would proceed with the project with or without international partners, but that it was seeking assistance from more than 20 coal-flush countries, including Australia and China.
Scientists, environmental groups and power industry officials generally lauded the plan, but many said the resulting technology would probably not change the status quo unless new emission standards forced plant owners to buy new equipment.
President Bush has rejected mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gases, calling only for voluntary measures to curb growth in emissions unless scientific research reveals clearer environmental risks.
"A large-scale demonstration of carbon-capture technology is a good idea, but without a requirement to limit carbon emissions the market won't use it," said David G. Hawkins, a climate policy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group.
Under the plan for the pilot power plant, governments would cover as much as 80 percent of the cost, and industry would pay the rest. Yesterday, officials from several big power companies said that committing their share, perhaps $200 million, would be hard, particularly with no guarantee that Congress would allocate the government's share.
"Companies are skittish about the ability of the federal government to deliver on a financial commitment over a long period of time," said Dale E. Heydlauff, a senior vice president of American Electric Power, an Ohio company that is the largest consumer of coal in the Western Hemisphere.
The prototype plant would be somewhat akin to several coal "gasification" power plants, which extract less-polluting gases from coal instead of burning it and unleashing all manner of emissions.
But the new design would go far beyond existing technologies, extracting nonpolluting hydrogen to generate electricity or to power fuel cells and pumping the carbon dioxide deep into the earth to avoid further buildup of the gas in the atmosphere.
Independent experts said that there were major technical challenges to overcome in every aspect of the design but that they were surmountable with a sustained effort and money.
The prototype plant would generate about 275 megawatts of electricity, or about a fourth of the output of a conventional large coal-fueled plant.
The Energy Department did not name a site but said it would probably be somewhere near coal reserves and in an area that would allow waste gases to be pumped into natural repositories.
Bush administration officials said they would play host to about 20 countries in June to try to enlist them in the project and other efforts to store carbon dioxide underground.

HEADLINE: Gypsies in Slovakia Complain of Sterilizations 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: PRESOV, Slovakia 

 BODY:
The morning after Zita, a young Gypsy mother, gave birth to her second child at age 17, a nurse shoved a piece of paper in front of her. Zita, who is illiterate, says she marked three crosses on the paper, and thus unwittingly agreed to be sterilized.
 "I don't know what was there," Zita said. "I can't read. I don't care what was on it, because I was in pain." 
 That was on Feb. 6, 1998. Today Zita is a slim 22-year-old with a sad, shy smile and not much of a future. She and her husband, Krystian, live on the outskirts of this eastern Slovak city in what is commonly called a Gypsy settlement -- actually a shantytown of shipping containers and wattle-and-daub huts with no running water.
When a second nurse told her she would no longer be able to have children, Zita recalled, "I started to cry and I screamed for the doctor."
Among Slovakia's poorest Gypsies, it is a woman's habit -- in the eyes of most, their duty -- to have many children, and women often have half a dozen or more by the time they are in their late 20's. 
According to a team of foreign and Slovak investigators for the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which published a report last month, doctors in eastern Slovakia have sterilized at least 110 young Gypsy women against their will since the fall of Communism in 1989. 
The most recent case they documented in visiting only 40 of Slovakia's 600 Gypsy communities was last fall, and the investigators suggest that despite strenuous denials from doctors, the practice continues.
"Roma women are being sterilized against their will and without their consent, and it's a violation of their rights," said Barbara Bukovska, a lawyer with the Counseling Center for Citizenship and Civil and Human Rights in Prague, and an adviser to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
Slovak doctors deny any form of discrimination, noting that Gypsy women rarely visit doctors before birth and often have infections, in part because of the conditions in which they live.
"Why would we do that?" Dr. Marian Kysely, head of the obstetric ward at J. A. Reiman Hospital, said when asked about the reported sterilizations.
The report says a number of Gypsies -- or Roma, as they call themselves -- were involuntarily sterilized or coerced into agreeing to sterilization in Dr. Kysely's clinic, but he denied that. 
"We have no interest to do it," he said, noting that a quarter of the children born in his ward are Gypsies. "Whether they are Roma or white, we do everything to have a healthy population."
"The Roma from the settlements have no toilets, no showers," Dr. Kysely said. "They are different from the point of view of hygiene." Some Gypsy women who complain of coerced sterilization, he said, may be suffering from untreated gynecological problems.
In its report, the Center for Reproductive Rights said it had uncovered "clear and consistent patterns" that showed doctors and nurses in eastern Slovakia "are complicit in the illegal and unethical practice of sterilizing Romany women without obtaining their consent."
The center's investigators, who included Slovak lawyers, Gypsy social workers and foreign doctors, lawyers and human rights experts, also said that Gyspy women were forced to deliver by Caesarean section far more often than ethnic Slovaks, and that Gypsy women often received substandard care and were put into segregated wards.
To date, the Slovak government has made only a brief inquiry, although the deputy prime minister for minority rights, Pal Csaky, has asked for a criminal investigation of the alleged sterilizations. At the same time, Mr. Csaky has warned that he may file charges against the center and its Slovak representatives.
"If we confirm this information," said Mr. Csaky's spokesman, Peter Miklosi, "we will expand our charges to the report's authors, that they knew about a crime for a year and did not report it to a prosecutor. And if we prove it is not true, they will be charged with spreading false information and damaging the good name of Slovakia."
Ms. Bukovska is now fighting Slovak prosecutors' requests that she turn over all of her clients' records to prove she is not spreading false information.
Dr. Karol Holoman, a prominent Slovak gynecologist sent recently by the Health Ministry to investigate, returned after a few days and denied the charges.
"The first conclusion is that it is not true that doctors prefer to sterilize Romany women," Dr. Holoman told the Slovak newspaper Sme. He said there was no evidence of segregation or of Gypsy women being forced to deliver by Caesarean section more often than ethnic Slovaks.
Every medical file in Ms. Bukovska's records was marked by doctors with a large capital letter R for Romany. Health workers almost never visit the shantytowns, where unemployment is almost universal and families subsist on government handouts.
Gypsies say the police have been harassing those who have spoken to news organizations since the report was released.
The Gypsy women who spoke to this reporter agreed to talk only on condition that their full names and the names of their villages were not used.
Zita's neighbor Maria, who is also illiterate and says she is either 26 or 27, has seven children, aged 4 to 14, and says she can have no more.
When she went to the old maternity ward in Presov to give birth to her youngest child, she said she was lying in a birthing chair when a nurse took her hand and forced her to sign a paper.
"They took me into the room, and I don't know what they did," Maria said. "They told me to sign this paper."
"Now," she said, "what I have is not normal."
According to Ms. Bukovska, who is her lawyer, medical records show that Maria was sterilized on Jan. 29, 1998. Ms. Bukovska says there is simply a typed notation, "The patient requests sterilization."
Maria said she did not speak Slovak well enough to ask the doctor to explain what had happened to her.

HEADLINE: Coming Soon to Meadowlands: Condos, Hotel and Golfing 

BYLINE:  By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Feb. 27 

 BODY:
The New Jersey Meadowlands Commission has approved a plan to transform 1,350 acres of smelly former landfill into a huge development featuring four golf courses surrounded by a resort hotel, commercial space and a residential village.
 The developer, EnCap Golf Holdings of Florida, plans to start work next summer on the $1 billion plan, which will preserve 1,250 acres of the parcel as open space, including the golf courses, which will be visible from the New Jersey Turnpike. 
 Susan Bass Levin, the New Jersey commissioner of community affairs and the chairwoman of the commission, said the plan was in keeping with Gov. James E. McGreevey's "smart growth" goal of curbing urban sprawl. "Someone said at the meeting yesterday that this project gives us an opportunity to heal our scars," Ms. Levin said. "This is an ugly area. It's a trash dump." 
She said EnCap would be responsible for closing off and cleaning up seven landfills and replacing them with the golf courses, parks, walking trails, shops and a resort hotel, as well as 2,000 apartments and condominiums for "active adults" over 55 and town houses for young families.
"It will truly be a dream come true in a place that has been a nightmare," she said, adding that planners had worked hard to come up with a design that would satisfy the need for economic development of the area without overwhelming public services or ignoring the need for open land.
The final plan left city officials, and even environmentalists, almost gushing. "You are creating a dream," Mayor Dennis Elwell of Secaucus told the commissioners in Trenton on Wednesday, when they voted unanimously on the plan. Several municipalities in the area will share in an estimated property tax bill of $20 million a year for EnCap.
"What it will mean is a cleaner river, a river less impacted by the shortsightedness of the past," said Bill Sheehan, executive director of the Hackensack Riverkeeper, an environmental group. The project, he said, will revitalize former wetlands that became garbage dumps beginning in the 1940's and then began leaching pollutants into the air and ground. 
EnCap, he said, has promised to revitalize the land with methods to ensure that pollutants are not released into the air or water. The process will cost the company almost $300 million.
"There's nothing natural about the habitat where they're going to build this," Mr. Sheehan said. "The scrubby trees growing out there are growing out of garbage. They're going to cap all that garbage off and bring in clean topsoil. Then they're going to build golf courses on it."
Ms. Levin, who was appointed to her post by Governor McGreevey a year ago, said the final plans for the development decreased the amount of office space that would be built, and increased the number of housing units for people over 55, to attract an older population that has been moving to Ocean County or to Florida. The plans also include more park space and walking trails, she said.
She said the commission looked closely at plans for the redevelopment of the nearby Continental Airlines Arena site, over which it has no control, to make sure that the two plans would not flood the market with their combined commercial space.

HEADLINE: Royal Ahold Ousts Leadership of Its Argentine Unit 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Royal Ahold, the Dutch supermarket operator, moved today to limit the damage from an accounting scandal by replacing the chief executive and board of its Argentine unit, Disco, and dispatching a Dutch management team to keep an eye on the unit.
 Ahold said it had completed an internal review of Disco's books and had found nothing amiss that could materially affect the parent company's reported results. Even so, Argentine tax authorities said they were preparing to investigate the legality of some accounting procedures at Disco. 
 Ahold's biggest problems stem from irregularities at an American subsidiary, U.S. Foodservice, where the company has said that improper booking of promotional allowances from suppliers caused it to overstate its earnings by $500 million over two years. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States attorney's office in Manhattan are investigating, and several executives at U.S. Foodservice have been suspended. Ahold's chief executive and chief financial officer said on Monday that they would resign, and the company's stock has lost two-thirds of its value in a week.
But Ahold's announcement that the problems at Disco were far from the scale of those at U.S. Foodservice buoyed investors today, and the stock regained a small part of its losses, closing at 3.52 euros ($3.79) a share in Amsterdam, up 0.72 euro from Wednesday's close.
In Buenos Aires, the main focus of concern has been the terms of Royal Ahold's phased takeover of Disco from 1998 to 2002. Disco was bought from the Peirano family, a clan of financiers whose business empire was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy at the time. Several members of the family have since been jailed in Uruguay.
Ahold's involvement with Disco began as a joint venture with Velox Retail Holdings, controlled by the Peiranos. But when Velox defaulted on its debts last year, Ahold was forced to buy out Velox's interest and absorb its liabilities. In a report to the Amsterdam stock exchange last July, Ahold said it was taking over $492 million in debt that Velox could not cancel; analysts and traders said the figure might have since grown to something like $750 million. 
Newspaper reports here have suggested that the accounting treatment of these liabilities could have been manipulated during the takeover. Royal Ahold and its auditors, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, declined to comment. 
"There were two main problems," said Ben Laidler, a regional analyst for UBS Warburg. "First, the price for the buyout was considered too high, given the poor economic situation in Argentina, and second, there was a huge question mark over their partners."
The Peiranos' empire effectively collapsed last year when the family's banks in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay closed or had their operations suspended. The patriarch of the family, Jorge Peirano Facio, 82, and three of his sons -- Jose, Dante and Jorge -- were arrested in Montevideo, charged with fraud and jailed pending trial. A fourth son, Juan, left Paraguay to avoid arrest there and is still free.
Ernesto Martorell, a corporate lawyer who has campaigned for tougher punishment for financial crimes here, said that it was not surprising that accusations of impropriety had surfaced concerning Disco. 
"The control of the company was previously in the hands of the Peiranos, and the fallout from the collapse of Velox has already resulted in a large number of legal actions," he said. 
The National Securities Commission of Argentina has not begun any investigation of Disco. Mr. Martorell said the authorities might want to avoid doing further damage to the local stock market, already debilitated by four years of bitter recession and Argentina's debt default last year. 
"If people start to doubt the credibility of auditing information of Argentine companies, the market, which is already seriously weakened, will sink even deeper," he said. 
Mounting scrutiny from the news media here and abroad seemed to have spurred Ahold to make an abrupt about-turn and take action at Disco. The Argentine unit's senior executives dismissed accusations of questionable accounting practices as recently as Monday, when Ahold's larger problems became known. Today, the company confirmed in a statement to the Buenos Aires stock exchange that Eduardo Orteu, its chief executive and a close ally of the Peiranos, would step down along with Disco's whole board "to help the company continue operating as normal." 
Ahold said it had brought in Alfred Garcia Pye, the head of its Santa Isabel chain in Peru, to be Disco's chief executive, and that he would receive "active support" from a management team flown in from the Netherlands to "enforce controls and ensure compliance with the Ahold business principles." Pieter de Nooij, an executive from Ahold's regional support group, will be Disco's new chief financial officer.
The housecleaning "reflects the general feeling that in Argentina, management practices are lax and there is a high level of impunity for financial misdeeds," Mr. Martorell said. 
Ahold, whose American grocery chains include Stop & Shop, Bi-Lo, Tops and Giant, has had trouble in Latin America for some time because of sharp currency devaluations in Argentina and Brazil and stagnant growth across the region. Operating profit from the Latin units declined 68 percent last year, to 39.7 million euros ($42.7 million) from 124.8 million euros ($134.2 million) in 2001. Now, its presence in the region is likely to change.
Ahold is already trying to sell its Santa Isabel stores in Chile to Jumbo, a local retail group. In Mexico, Ahold was seen as a potential bidder or partner for Comerci, a retailer trying to hold its own against Wal-Mart's rapid expansion, but Ahold now has more pressing needs for its cash and management attention. 
In Brazil, Royal Ahold owns Bompreco Supermercados do Nordeste, one of the largest supermarket chains; analysts said it could easily be sold to either Carrefour of France or Pao de Acucar, which are vying for market leadership in Brazil and are keen to make acquisitions.
Ahold said today that it did not yet know whether it would have audited results for 2002 in time for its annual meeting on May 13.

HEADLINE: Profits Increase 13% at Nestle 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: VEVEY, Switzerland, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Nestle, the food and beverages company, said today its profit rose 13 percent in 2002, but the rise was limited by one-time charges and a weak fourth-quarter performance in Latin America. 
 The owner of Stouffer's meals and Taster's Choice coffee earned 7.56 billion Swiss francs ($5.5 billion) last year, up from 6.68 billion francs a year earlier. 
 Sales rose 5.3 percent, to 89.16 billion Swiss francs ($65.7 billion) from 84.7 billion francs in 2001. 
The profit was slightly below analysts' expectations and shares of Nestle fell 1.9 percent, to close at 263 francs ($193.08) on the Zurich exchange. 
But the company said it would propose a dividend of 7 francs ($5.14), up from 6.40 francs last year. 
Nestle said net profit was influenced by a number of one-time items, including the partial flotation of the ophthalmic goods specialist Alcon and the sale to Givaudan of the flavors business Food Ingredients Specialties. The company also incurred expenses relating to revamping and to impairments of good will, plants and equipment. 
Operations in the United States, Canada and Brazil recorded sales growth above what they achieved in 2001, while in countries like Japan, Mexico and Argentina, the general economic slowdown weighed on sales. 
Growth increased in Europe in the second half of the year, with France, Nestle's largest European market, growing at more than twice the level of the previous year, the company said. 
The chief financial officer, Wolfgang H. Reichenberger, said sales have started slowly in the first quarter of 2003, but added that this was primarily because Easter falls later than usual this year.

HEADLINE: REBUILDING AT GROUND ZERO: URBAN DESIGN; 
Not Solely Blueprints, But Cultural Insight, Too

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
Daniel Libeskind's study in urban fragmentation is not, perhaps, the vision that the public was looking for at ground zero when it rejected the six plans originally presented by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in July. The development corporation's land-use committee favored the other finalist's design chosen from a study project conducted last year. But our elected officials have spoken. The losing plan, for towers of steel lattice, prepared by the Think team, will enter the golden archive of the city that never was.
 Public officials will also have their say on the culturaluses that will be brought together on this site. These uses should weigh at least as heavily on the public conscience as the architectural design. The Libeskind plan creates a rhetorical context in which it is all too easy to imagine the "freedom museum" that city and state planners have been talking about as part of the site for the past year. 
 Potentially a repackaged version of the cold war, with Al Qaeda taking the place of the Soviet Union, the museum evokes a vision contrary to the idealistic concept its planners may intend. Instead of upholding liberty as a principle of daily life, are we not at risk of relegating it to the walls of a museum?
Yet so much has been learned. And this is the moment for New Yorkers to take stock of the many positive benefits that have emerged in the course of the design process. The most important of these, perhaps, is that public building is itself an educational process. Far more than a set of designs, images or blueprints for physical objects that will be realized in urban space, architecture is also the art of mapping changing relationships between social and artistic values.
The intensity of public interest in the future of ground zero cannot be entirely explained by the psychological assault inflicted on us by terrorism. It also reflects a change in the public's relationship to architecture itself. In the past decade, a new audience for contemporary architecture has coalesced. Weary of being condescended to with picturesque building skins, "appropriate" contextual design guidelines and other shopworn formulas for visual distraction, New York has awakened to more enlightened concepts of urbanism that have been embraced by other cities of its class.
That awakening prompted the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to rethink its approach to ground zero. The agency's design study project, undertaken in response to public displeasure, produced ideas as fresh as any that have emerged from architecture in recent years. Now that one of them has been selected, it will be possible to examine all of these plans with scholarly detachment. Several of them are destined to influence the future of city planning in New York and elsewhere. The importance of the design study cannot be overstated.
Less happily, but no less usefully, the design process exposed the large gap that still divides the audience for contemporary architecture from those who design and build our city. Sept. 11 arrived at a moment of crisis for the New York architectural profession. Developers here count on large architectural firms to provide two services. First, and most important, are the connections it takes to usher projects through the gantlet of political obstacles that stand in their way.
Second, developers rely on architects to provide the elusive commodity of cultural value. This product has become more precious in recent years. Even business publications report on the value that developers hope to gain from architecture rather than some stale simulation of it. This is likely to continue as more cities turn to culture as an economic tool.
In recent years, however, these two services have become increasingly irreconcilable. "Getting it done" requires an eagerness to compromise with the lowest common denominator of taste. Architecture requires greater strength of character, vision, integrity and brains. The two objectives had neutralized each other years before 9/11.
The ground zero design process has opened up a promising way out of this creative impasse. The sign reads: collaboration.
Of the six independent teamsthat produced plans for the World Trade Center site during the study project, all but two involved collaboration between individual offices. The future is with them. To survive in the changing cultural environment, the city's large firms will have to reconfigure themselves as support structures for architects of distinct conviction. Fewer clients will want to "get it done" with ideas that are not worth doing.
Are they willing to risk the conflict that important ideas often arouse? Here again, the design process has made an invaluable contribution to New York architecture. In the past months, people have learned to be more comfortable with conflict -- with discomfort, in fact. They've raised their voices, not always in reason, and the sky hasn't fallen. On the contrary, the horizon has risen. The ante has been upped.
Conflict hasn't been incidental to this upward readjustment in New York's architectural aspirations. Without conflict, it could not have occurred. Indeed, the design process has given this city a priceless insight into the way great cities work. Conflict is the most important cultural product that a great city puts out. It is the fuel that drives everything else.

HEADLINE: New York Seeks Federal Help In Paying State Jobless Claims 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
New York State wants to borrow an additional $860 million from the federal government to finance unemployment benefits for jobless workers, bringing its total loan to more than $1.6 billion, the New York State Department of Labor announced yesterday.
 With high joblessness continuing to plague the state, its unemployment insurance fund has been running in the red since December. New York has already borrowed under a federal program that automatically lends states money so they can continue to pay jobless benefits. Under that program, it had asked for $760 million in loans, which were supposed to keep the fund solvent through March. 
 But in a letter sent Tuesday to the federal Department of Labor, Lewis Stein, director of finance for the New York State Department of Labor, said the state needed $400 million in March alone, plus $460 million for April and May.
The state will have to pay interest at a rate of 6.08 percent annually, according to the federal Labor Department. If the state does not repay the borrowings within two years, the federal government institutes an automatic charge on employers.
Unemployment insurance funds have run into financial trouble in several states, but New York's situation appears to be the most severe.
State officials attribute the fund's debt to the spike in unemployment after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and the continuing recession. Since September 2001, the statewide unemployment rate has risen to 6.3 percent from 5.2 percent; in New York City, the rate has jumped to 8.4 percent from 6.6 percent.
Some analysts suggested, however, that at least some of the fund's difficulties were caused by the Pataki administration's efforts to reduce employers' unemployment insurance taxes during the boom years.
And advocates for the unemployed contend that the fund's financial problems are already prompting state labor officials to try to reduce the amount of money the fund needs by denying benefits to some jobless people.
"There is enormous pressure to hold down claims and hold down the duration of claims," said Jonathan Rosen, a founder of the New York Unemployment Project. "They are digging deeper to try to disqualify people."
But Robert M. Lillpopp, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor, said, "We make every effort to make sure those people who are due unemployment insurance benefits receive them."
While unemployment insurance claims have dropped recently, they remain higher than they were a year ago. Over the last month, an average of almost 24,000 people a week have applied for unemployment benefits. During the same stretch of 2002, the number was below 23,000.

Omnicom Debt Is Downgraded

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service has downgraded its rating on the senior unsecured debt of the Omnicom Group in New York by one notch, to three notches above junk status. 
 In reducing the rating on Omnicom's senior unsecured debt, to Baa1 from A3, Moody's cited concern over increasing debt, the state of the general advertising market and the uncertainty over a war with Iraq and its effect on the global economy. 
 The change, made on Wednesday, came a day after Omnicom, which owns agencies like BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide, reported improved results in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Business Print Ads Were Down in 2002

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Business-to-business print advertising ended 2002 on a low note as ad pages fell again in December, continuing an uninterrupted decline that began in November 2000, according to the Business Information Network, a joint venture of American Business Media and the CMR unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
 For all of 2002, ad pages fell 15 percent compared with those in 2001. 
In December, ad pages declined 2.2 percent from those in December 2001. December ad pages rose in 5 of 12 categories. The largest increases came in travel, up 25 percent; drugs and toiletries, up 22.5 percent; and computers, up 11.5 percent. The biggest declines came in telecommunications, down 29.9 percent; manufacturing, down 26.3 percent; and finance, business and advertising, down 14.8 percent. 
 Gordon Hughes, president and chief executive at American Business Media in New York, predicted that ad pages for business-to-business publications will increase 1 percent to 2 percent in 2003 from last year.

HEADLINE: REBUILDING AT GROUND ZERO: THE FUTURE; 
Vision for Lower Manhattan Is Still in Flux

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Daniel Libeskind, the architect selected to oversee the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, painted a vivid picture yesterday of what New Yorkers can expect to see in four years at the intersection of Fulton and Greenwich Streets: the entrance to a memorial garden that slopes down 30 feet below street level, a museum and a 70-story skyscraper beside a glass tower topped by an antenna that would soar a symbolic 1,776 feet into the sky.
 As the winner of a grueling design competition, Mr. Libeskind was exuberant. Joseph Seymour, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the 16-acre site, was more pragmatic. 
 In four years, Mr. Seymour said, he expects the memorial garden will be completed, as well as a $2 billion transit center that will rival Grand Central Terminal and newly built stretches of Greenwich and Fulton Streets that are to crisscross the site. But many other elements of Mr. Libeskind's striking plans, he said, are "going to have to evolve." 
"We need to work with Libeskind to develop design guidelines for the buildings," Mr. Seymour said.
"The commercial space will evolve over time," he added. "It has to be driven by the market."
Some of the most striking elements of Mr. Libeskind's designs have already "evolved." The "garden in the sky" that was in the original vision he presented in December, in the first stage of the architectural competition he won this week, has disappeared from his glass tower, the tallest building envisioned on the site, replaced by a more sedate restaurant and observation deck. The apartment buildings in the initial plan were dropped to make room for a total of 10 million square feet of office space in five towers, ranging from 55 stories to 70 stories.
The memorial garden, which embraces the footprints of the twin towers, descends 30 feet below street level, to a surface that appeared grassy in the renditions shown yesterday, not 70 feet to naked bedrock, as in his original plan.
It is still unclear where the money for the garden, the museum or the performing arts center will come from, or exactly when they will be built. Many officials said yesterday that the money would come from a combination of federal funds and an international fund-raising effort.
"I have always believed that, for the memorial, we can get additional funding," said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. "And I believe we can raise money."
But Mr. Libeskind's design for a submerged memorial park or garden exposes the slurry wall surrounding the site and presents challenges for the adjacent roadway. It requires submerging West Street from Vesey Street to Liberty Street, at an estimated cost of $500 million to $700 million.
"There is no question," said Roland W. Betts, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation director who oversaw the site planning effort, "to make the slurry wall work, that is the material element in his plan."
Mr. Doctoroff suggested that some of the money could come from private donations.
"Greenwich Street, West Street, Liberty Street and Vesey Street form the memorial precinct," he said. "You can make the argument that everything within that precinct is part of the memorial, and money for that can be raised privately."
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta announced yesterday that he had placed the Lower Manhattan recovery effort on his department's priority list. The department is overseeing $4.75 billion for a number of downtown transportation projects, including the PATH station at the World Trade Center site, the South Ferry terminal and the Fulton Street transit center.
In the next few weeks, Mr. Libeskind will be working with the development corporation and the Port Authority on a more detailed plan, and on the design for the underground transit hub. His work will change the current plan still more: he will have to take into account the demands of the Port Authority, as well as those of the developer who holds the lease for the trade center site, Larry A. Silverstein; surrounding property owners; and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
There is already much debate over whether there should be a large, enclosed mall and how the site will be connected to Battery Park City.
"These things have to be adjusted to the realities of each stakeholder," Alexander Garvin, director of planning for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said of Mr. Libeskind's current designs.
The office buildings themselves, however, will be designed by the architect hired by the site's developer, Mr. Silverstein, and may not look anything like the towers depicted by Mr. Libeskind. Mr. Silverstein and his partners, who pay $120 million a year in rent, have selected David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to design the first tower.
Mr. Silverstein is locked in a bitter legal battle with his insurers. He claims that he is entitled to a double insurance payment of nearly $7 billion because there were two attacks on two different buildings at the trade center. That is more than enough to build 10 million square feet of office space. But if Mr. Silverstein loses, he would get only $3.55 billion, and some developers estimate that he could build only about 6.8 billion square feet.
He must also find a tenant at a time when Wall Street is laying off thousands of employees and more than 14 million square feet of office space downtown sits empty.
"It's going to be very difficult to regain those jobs anytime soon," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com., a consulting firm. "The centrifugal forces driving those jobs out of New York City are great. Both cost and security concerns are inducing large financial firms to relocate at least part of their operations."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "IN THE WORKS: A New Look for the World Trade Center Site"Studio Daniel Libeskind's plan for the World Trade Center site defines land usage, such as the memorial space, street pattern and building footprints. Although buildings are conceived in the plan, what structures will actually be built is less certain. MEMORIAL 4.5-acre memorial park about 30 feet below street level, preserving the footprints of both original towers. Smaller memorial site at bedrock, 70 feet below street level. COMMERCIAL SPACE About 10 million square feet of office space in five towers, with the signature building being a 1,776-foot-tall tower. 880,000 square feet of retail space, about evenly divided between above and below ground. CULTURAL SPACE 280,000 to 380,000 square feet of museum and cultural space. 45,000-square-foot performing arts center with 2,000-seat auditorium. HOTEL 360,000 to 560,000 square feet of hotel space. 800 to 1,000 rooms. TRANSPORTATION Transportation center connects subway, PATH trains, and possibly an extension to other commuter trains or airports. WEDGE OF LIGHT Open area around intersection of Fulton and Greenwich Streets will be in the path of direct sunlight from 8:48 a.m. to 10:28 a.m. each year on Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

* "ABOUT SCHMIDT," starring Jack Nicholson, Kathy Bates and Hope Davis. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 125 minutes). Mr. Nicholson's portrayal of Warren Schmidt, a retired insurance executive from Omaha at loose ends after the death of his wife, may be the most astonishing dramatic transformation of his 44-year screen career. Plodding in a weary, stiff-legged shuffle, this great actor reins in his bad-boy mannerisms to convey a deep, sorrowful awareness of human complexity. As the movie follows the attempts of this staid 66-year-old everyman to regain his equilibrium, it sustains an exquisite balance between a satire of Middle American life and the wrenching pathos of Warren's situation as he tries to form a bond with his resentful grown-up daughter (Ms. Davis) (Stephen Holden).

"ALL THE REAL GIRLS," starring Paul Schneider, Zooey Deschanel and Patricia Clarkson. Written and directed by David Gordon Green (R, 108 minutes). Mr. Green follows "George Washington," his luminous found fable of Southern childhood, with a more conventional story of young love. Mr. Schneider plays a small-town cad whose easygoing promiscuity is derailed by Ms. Deschanel, whose character has just returned home from boarding school. Their sweet, fumbling romance is captured with scruffy, low-key lyricism. The film is an awkward hybrid of free-form, do-it-yourself filmmaking and professional discipline (supplied by the wonderful Ms. Deschanel, and by Ms. Clarkson), but its beauty and sincerity overcome its flaws and hesitations (A. O. Scott).

* "CATCH ME IF YOU CAN," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. Directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 140 minutes). This supremely entertaining fable of self-invention in the land of opportunity tells the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Mr. DiCaprio), a teenager from New Rochelle, N.Y., who by the age of 19 had successfully impersonated an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and had amassed millions of dollars from forging checks. Part comedy, part caper film, this picaresque tale gently satirizes the sillier side of the swinging 60's. It is also a cat-and-mouse game in which Frank tries to elude Carl Hanratty (Mr. Hanks), an earnest, fuddy-duddy F.B.I. agent who finally catches up with him in France. Mr. DiCaprio, that chameleonic 28-year-old man-child, is, in a word, sensational (Holden).

"CHICAGO," starring Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere. Directedand choreographed by Rob Marshall (PG-13, 108 minutes). It's rare to find a picture as exuberant, as shallow -- and as exuberant about its shallowness -- as Mr. Marshall's film adaptation of the Broadway musical "Chicago." The movie, set in Prohibition-era Chicago as it follows the murder trial of the manipulative Kewpie doll Roxie Hart (Ms. Zellweger), is tough, brittle fun. It's the raw expenditure of energy and the canniness of the staging that should pull audiences in and keep them rooted. This, of course, is undoubtedly the best way to present a movie take on Bob Fosse's digressive musical version of "Chicago." This new picture maintains the relentless spirit of Fosse's blunt suavity and the breathless, black-silk enthusiasm of Kander and Ebb's songs. Ms. Zeta-Jones, in Louise Brooks wig and ruthless smile, is Roxie's fellow felon and jailbird, Velma. And as the big-ticket defense lawyer and jury barometer Billy Flynn, Mr. Gere has never been better, turning spoiled princeling arrogance into a witty revel (Elvis Mitchell).

* "CITY OF GOD," starring Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora and Seu Jorge. Directed by Fernando Meirelles (R, 130 minutes; in Portuguese, with English subtitles). A scorching anecdotal history of gang warfare in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, "City of God" is narrated by Rocket (Mr. Rodrigues), a young photographer who chronicles the deterioration of the housing project in which he grew up from a shantytown into a war zone. The movie, which begins in the 1960's and ends in the early 80's, parallels Rocket's story with the rise of his childhood playmate Li'l Ze (Mr. da Hora) from a petty thief into a ruthless drug dealer and neighborhood kingpin commanding a small army of gun-toting children. The history is told in a loose, tall-tale style that suggests a quasi-cinema-verite version of Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" (Holden).

"DAREDEVIL," starring Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (PG-13, 96 minutes). Sometimes playing a comic-book hero gives actors a chance to show suave, stylized moves. After stripping off their civvies, they emerge from the phone booth a star. Christopher Reeve gave a breezy, farcical charge to Superman and Clark Kent. As Batman and his alter ego, the wastrel playboy Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton seemed to have a thousand things on his mind, most of them unpleasant. But poor Ben Affleck is lost in the minor, passable "Daredevil," where he portrays the blind, red-costumed and horn-headed crime fighter whose other senses -- hearing, touch, taste -- were exaggerated in the chemical accident that cost him his sight. A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role. Even his scarlet leather outfit makes him diminutive. The interlocked double D on his left breast makes him look like part of the food-service industry: "Hi, I'm Daredevil, and I'll be your superhero this evening" (Mitchell).

"FINAL DESTINATION 2," starring Ali Larter, A. J. Cook and Michael Landes. Directed by David R. Ellis (R, 97 minutes). This gleefully morbid sequel may, in the end, be as nonsensical as its title, but it's also much more imaginative. Ms. Larter is Clear Rivers, the sole survivor of the first "Final Destination," who has locked herself away to hide from the grisly death she is sure must be stalking her. Ms. Cook is Kimberly, who has foreseen, and escaped, a horrific traffic accident and is now similarly stalked. But death, which turns out to have a macabre and elaborate sense of humor, gets all thebest material, and the filmmakers delight in staging a series of ghoulishly slapstick demises, involving pigeons and refrigerator magnets as well as the more traditional exploding cars and out-of-control elevators. The spirit of the movie is best summed up in the following line, spoken by a television news reporter after one such death. "Ironically, the woman was impaled through the head after her air bag inflated." Ironically indeed (Scott).

* "GANGS OF NEW YORK," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 165 minutes). Long awaited, enormously expensive, endlessly gossiped about, Mr. Scorsese's brutal epic of mid-19th-century Manhattan is a near-great film that, as time goes by, may well make up the distance. As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story -- a revenge tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Mr. DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Mr. Day-Lewis) -- is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. In his mouth the rough vernacular of the old New York streets becomes poetry. If Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is the way it brings history to life, not merely by meticulously recreating its details but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continues to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to re-imagine the germs of America's historical identity. It suggests, with vivid plausibility, that clues to the national character can be found in the violent, contradictory and often tragic story of the urban immigrant working class (Scott).

"HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS," starring Kate Hudson, Matthew McConaughey and Bebe Neuwirth. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG-13, 100 minutes). Yet another mediocre New York romantic comedy, yes, but notably less mediocre than "Maid in Manhattan" and "Two Weeks Notice." This is because Ms. Hudson and Mr. McConaughey are an energetic, well-matched comic pair, and because the writers have smuggled a few sharp, funny jokes into the lockstep conventions of the plot. The premise, too, has a nice frost of screwball cynicism, as the two principals woo each other for venal, professional reasons. Ben (Mr. McConaughey), a tomcatting ad man, must make a woman fall in love with him if he is to win a big account; to write a feature story for a women's magazine, Andie (Ms. Hudson) must drive a man away. Would you believe that they actually fall in love? Nobody would, but it's sometimes fun to pretend, just as it's fun to pretend that the advertising and magazine industries are untouched by recession, the Knicks are in the N.B.A. finals and Staten Island is full of people who talk as if they're from Texas (Scott).

"KANGAROO JACK," starring Jerry O'Connell, Anthony Anderson and Christopher Walken. Directed by David McNally (PG, 88 minutes). A marsupial steals some mob money from a pair of half-wit Brooklynites (Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Anderson), who are pursued across the Outback by various Australian and New York heavies. This might have been amusing, but except for the guilty pleasure of seeing Mr. Walken in yet another unredeemably bad movie, there is very little fun to be had. The movie's crude, dippy humor seems motivatedby a deep contempt for its intended audience of school-age children (Scott).

"THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE," starring Kevin Spacey. Directed by Alan Parker (R, 130 minutes). In this would-be thriller, Mr. Spacey plays a death-penalty opponent facing execution for murder. As the title character, a downtrodden philosophy professor and activist who's become an alcoholic criminal, he evinces a weariness in his voice. The words float out of his mouth as if he were too tired to muster the strength for a single inflection, and this gives the picture the merest trace of believability. But that's before the crude, bullying narrative begins peppering the audience with kidney punches: "David Gale" may be the first liberal-leaning movie that could be brought up on assault charges since its director made "Midnight Express." Mr. Parker seems to think audiences are incapable of coming to their own conclusions, so he relieves them of that burden by doing it for them (Mitchell).

"LOST IN LA MANCHA," with Terry Gilliam. Written and directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe (R, 89 minutes). After watching this fascinating and compelling new documentary, you may forever wonder how it is that movies are made at all. "Lost" may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but it is a great story; its directors display dramatic intelligence. "Lost" is an inside view of how a film -- in this case, Mr. Gilliam's "Man Who Killed Don Quixote" -- can fall to pieces, even under the guidance of a master director. Imagine watching a real-life version of Ian McKellen's kindly, indomitable Gandalf in "Lord of the Rings" give his life for his cause, only to find that his supreme gesture is meaningless because his fellows are slaughtered anyway. That's what "Lost" is like. What's clear and astonishingly entertaining about "Lost" is that the directors' only good luck was that they happened to be safely behind the scenes when epic mishaps struck so often on the set that Beelzebub probably put in for overtime (Mitchell).

"THE RECRUIT," starring Al Pacino, Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan. Directed by Roger Donaldson (PG-13, 105 minutes). The C.I.A. setting, the utterly predictable plot twists, the chase scenes and the climactic bout of gunplay may suggest a thriller, but really this slick and pointless exercise belongs to a more specialized genre: the Al Pacino crazy-mentor picture. This time, Mr. Pacino is Walter Burke, whose job is to recruit and train intelligence operatives. "I have a scary eye for talent," he says. What Mr. Pacino displays is his peculiar, and often amusing, gift for ranting, spluttering and braying, and his wildly unpredictable, borderline-incoherent performance is the only interesting thing in the movie. Mr. Farrell, as Burke's troubled protege, James Clayton, an M.I.T. graduate student who seems to have misplaced his shaving kit in all the excitement, works very hard without producing anything like the casual, nutty intensity Mr. Pacino can summon so effortlessly. Ms. Moynahan is James's fellow trainee and love interest, who may or may not be a mole (Scott).

HEADLINE: Sharon's New Government Increases Pressure on Arafat 

BYLINE:  By GREG MYRE 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Friday, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's new right-wing government won parliamentary approval early today, and he declared that peace negotiations with the Palestinians would not resume until the violence stops and the current Palestinian leadership is replaced.
 Mr. Sharon's prescription for resolving the conflict was familiar, but he now presides over a government that is considerably more hawkish than his previous one. The composition of the new government could complicate international efforts to restart negotiations that collapsed more than two years ago. 
 "Before returning to the diplomatic track there is a need for ending terror and incitement, for reforms within the Palestinian Authority to be implemented, and for replacing the existing leadership," Mr. Sharon said in remarks on Thursday afternoon directed at Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
The speech came a day after President Bush said that a war to topple President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would make the region more stable and could lay the groundwork for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Israel would be expected to support the creation of a Palestinian state and must stop expanding settlements, Mr. Bush said.
However, prospects for a swift resumption of the peace talks remain dim.
Mr. Bush has strongly supported Mr. Sharon during the Middle East fighting, and both have made clear they would like to see Mr. Arafat replaced, though Mr. Arafat's position appears solid for now.
Mr. Sharon's four-party coalition, which was formally approved in a vote shortly after midnight, holds 68 of the 120 seats in Parliament. None of the four parties are calling for a resumption of peace talks.
Two far-right groups, the National Union and the National Religious Party, reject a Palestinian state under any circumstances. Mr. Sharon's Likud Party, the largest single faction, with 40 seats, contains some members who do not want a Palestinian state and some like Mr. Sharon who say they would accept a limited state under certain conditions. The fourth coalition member, the center-right Shinui Party, favors resuming peace talks after Mr. Arafat is gone.
While a large part of his speech was devoted to the conflict, Mr. Sharon said improving Israel's slumping economy, now in its third year of recession, was the "primary mission" of his government.
Palestinians accuse Mr. Sharon of erecting obstacles that have blocked diplomatic proposals by the United States and other would-be international mediators. In addition, Palestinian leaders say the hard-liners who will dominate the new Israeli government could aggravate tensions by emphasizing military actions and supporting the building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
"President Bush is talking about a Palestinian state, and Sharon is determined to undermine it," said Saeb Erekat a cabinet member in the Palestinian Authority. "The only thing that is missing from this government is the peace process."
Mr. Sharon's focus in recent days has been on filling fiercely contested cabinet posts in his new government. Shortly before the parliamentary session began on Thursday, Benjamin Netanyahu, a former prime minister, reversed an earlier decision and agreed to serve as finance minister after demanding and receiving expanded powers.
In the latest chapter of a rivalry that dates back years, Mr. Sharon dismissed Mr. Netanyahu as foreign minister on Wednesday and offered him the Finance Ministry job, which Mr. Netanyahu rejected. Mr. Netanyahu then reconsidered, and aides for the two men met for hours, holding additional talks on Thursday to seal the deal.
Mr. Netanyahu has been promised broad autonomy over economic decisions, and he will be put in charge of state-run companies, including those that are candidates for privatization. He also sought to be named acting prime minister when Mr. Sharon is out of the country, but he was rebuffed, people familiar with the talks said.
Mr. Sharon filled the Foreign Ministry post with Silvan Shalom, the departing finance minister, who has no formal diplomatic experience but is considered a close ally of Mr. Sharon's.
Israeli political analysts said Mr. Sharon would have had difficulty controlling the outspoken Mr. Netanyahu had he remained the foreign minister. Mr. Netanyahu calls for ousting Mr. Arafat and dismantling the Palestinian Authority.

HEADLINE: Fight Is Likely in Senate as Bush Sends Tax Cut Plan to Congress 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
President Bush's tax cut plan moved from speechmaking to legislation today when it was introduced in both houses of Congress, setting off what may be the most tumultuous debate of the Congressional session.
 Within minutes of the introduction of the bill, which Republicans are calling the Jobs and Growth Tax Act of 2003, it was clear that significant changes would have to be made to get it through the closely divided Senate. Each party immediately began maneuvering to shape the bill to its political needs. With centrist senators of both parties questioning the wisdom of a $695 billion tax cut at a time of rocketing deficits and military spending needs, Democrats expressed new confidence that they could significantly reduce its size. 
 "It's dead on arrival," said Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and the Senate minority leader, asserting that the Republicans did not have the votes to approve components like the elimination of the tax on dividends. Many of the Democrats who voted for the administration's tax cut in 2001, when the budget was in surplus, say they cannot do so again.
"It's fairly clear that despite all their weeks of campaigning, the tax package still does not have the votes to pass the Senate," said Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, an important Democratic vote in support of the administration's previous tax package. "Support for the dividend tax reduction, especially, is just not there." Mr. Breaux said that if the administration dropped the dividend proposal, the rest of the package would probably pass, with some changes.
Republicans worked to demonstrate party unity on the bill today, bringing Treasury Secretary John W. Snow to news conferences in both wings of the Capitol to support it. "This plan, we believe, will be the jumper cables and the gasoline for America's economic engine," said Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio, chairwoman of the House Republican Caucus.
The House, in the firm control of Republicans who favor tax cuts, is likely to give the president most of what he wants, and the Ways and Means Committee expects to hold hearings on the bill beginning Tuesday.
The real negotiations will be in the Senate, and today even Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, referred to the bill only as an "excellent starting point," hinting strongly about the changes to come.
"It's bound to be altered to some extent," Mr. Nickles said. "To a minimum, I hope."
The bill introduced today would speed up the 2001 tax cuts -- which reduced rates and the marriage penalty and increased child tax credits -- and would make them permanent instead of expiring in 2011. It would also allow small businesses to write off more of the cost of new equipment, increasing the amount to $75,000 from $25,000, which is intended to promote investment.
But the largest part of the bill is the elimination of the dividend tax, which Republicans say would lift the stock market and bring relief to many small investors. Mr. Nickles presented a chart today asserting that the combination of corporate and dividend taxes placed the United States second in the world in its taxation of corporate profits, behind Japan.
Democrats countered by bringing to the microphone a retired federal worker who said she had no stock investments and thus would get nothing from the dividend tax cut. Party leaders said the cut would drain money from Social Security and Medicare, and would harm the economy by vastly increasing the deficit.
Only one Democrat, Senator Zell Miller of Georgia, has signed on to the president's plan, and today he appeared with Mr. Nickles as one of its most fervent sponsors.
"The shrill class-warfare crowd can jump up and down all they want, but this is no sop to the rich," Mr. Miller said. "In Georgia, 60 percent of the dividend earners make less than $75,000. Is that rich? This dividend proposal is about making taxes more fair."
Mr. Miller said that when the final vote was called he would not be the only Democrat who supported the tax cuts.
That may be true, Democrats and some Republicans say, if the tax package is substantially changed. At the moment the administration may not even have enough Republican votes to approve its dividend plan. Several centrist Republicans, including Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, have said it is not the right time to cut taxes so deeply.
"I support the dividendtax cut, but I think we've got to rev up our economy first and then consider it as part of a tax reform package," Mr. Voinovich said today. "Right now we need measures that put money into the economy and immediately create jobs without adding to the deficit over the long term. A lot of what the president proposed fits that bill, but the dividend tax cut doesn't right now, so we need to put it off for later."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE INFLAMED REGION; 
Talk of Arab 'Democracy' Is a Double-Edged Scimitar

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Rifaat al-Said, a member of Egypt's Parliament from a small liberal party, has for years called for a restoration of constitutional rights, a more open electoral system and greater freedoms for the country's Coptic Christians. He spent 14 years in prison under Gamal Abdel Nasser for uttering the word "democracy." He now lives and works under armed guard because he has criticized Islamic extremists.
 So when President Bush argues -- as he did again on Wednesday night -- that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein could spread the seeds of democracy across the Arab world, Mr. Said scoffs, naming autocratic Arab countries the United States has long supported as strategic allies, including Egypt. 
 "Why do they continue to support Saudi Arabia?" Mr. Said said in his office in the center of Cairo. "Why do they support the Prince of Qatar? Why did they support Saddam Hussein in the past? Why do they believe that democracy will create a paradise in Egypt?"
Mr. Bush's vision of a new Iraq -- democratic, oil-rich and allied with the West -- may have become an overarching justification for his argument to oust Mr. Hussein by force. But interviews with politicians and analysts here suggest many Arabs are unconvinced that a war against Iraq would bring stability, let alone democracy, a view supported by a large, boisterous antiwar demonstration today.
On the contrary, those interviewed said the forcible overthrow of Iraq's dictatorship would unleash a fury of anti-American sentiment, especially among fundamentalist Islamic forces, resulting in new crackdowns that would stifle democratic changes.
Even those who might benefit most from democracy here -- people like Mr. Said or Essam el-Erian, whose political organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, is officially banned -- argued that the imposition of democracy by force in Iraq would be viewed as American repression, not liberation.
"By destroying Iraq," said Dr. Erian, a pathologist who has spent six years in prison under Egypt's emergency laws, "you are opening the door not to democracy, but to hell."
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and other Arab leaders have expressed a greater fear of the potential turmoil caused by war -- economic disruption, civilian deaths, refugees, street protests -- than of any demands for democratic reforms that might emerge from it.
Mr. Mubarak dismissed the prospect of democracy washing over the region during his visit last week to France, where he joined President Jacques Chirac in opposing the Bush administration's plans for war.
Just this week Egypt's Parliament, dominated by Mr. Mubarak's National Democratic Party, voted overwhelmingly to extend the country's emergency laws for three years, until the middle of 2006. The laws forbid public assembly, permit military tribunals for many crimes and allow security services to detain anyone.
There was virtually no debate.
"The repercussions of war are very difficult to calculate," said Mr. Said, the secretary of the leftist Tagamua party and one of only 30 deputies, out of 454, who opposed extending the emergency laws. "We need democracy; it's necessary, obviously necessary. But when it comes to repercussions, perhaps it will be the contrary that happens."
Egypt's emergency laws have basically been in effect for more than three decades. Even though they were not due for renewal until May, the Parliament acted early, approving the extension within hours of a bill proposing it late Sunday.
Prime Minister Atif Ubayd called the extension necessary "to protect our nation against its enemies and to protect our citizens from thoselying in wait for them." He also cited new security laws passed in the United States and other countries after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington as justification for extending them in Egypt.
Dr. Erian found irony in Mr. Ubayd's remarks. He said it was perhaps the Arab world that was influencing the United States, rather than vice versa.
"John Ashcroft's arrests of Arab men, the treatment of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, military tribunals -- all of it is exported from here," he said, laughing.
Such skepticism is deeply held here. The reasons include the United States' longstanding alliances with undemocratic Arab states -- including Egypt -- and the Bush administration's support of Israel, whose treatment of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories is widely viewed here as undemocratic. 
Many of those interviewed accused Mr. Bush of double standards in calling for democracy in the Arab world when it has demanded the ouster of Yasir Arafat as leader of the Palestinian Authority, even though he was chosen in an internationally monitored election. Dr. Erian also noted that Iran, an Islamic, if not Arab state, was "more democratic than any other in the region" but has been branded by Mr. Bush as part of what he views as an "axis of evil."
Mamoun al-Hudaibi, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, whose organization has struggled to operate freely under Egyptian prosecution, said in an interview at today's rally that no Egyptian or Arab would accept a democracy imposed by force, especially one from abroad. "Liberty is not a gift from others," he said. "If we do not acquire it for ourselves, it will never be liberty." 
The Sept. 11 attacks -- and the Bush administration's subsequent war on Al Qaeda and Afghanistan -- led Arab leaders and intellectuals to question whether repression of dissent had fueled Islamic extremism. 
Since then some Arab nations have signaled a willingness to consider reforms. To accelerate them, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell announced a program last year aimed at promoting Arab economic growth and democratization, pledging $29 million in aid this year and $145 million in the next.
The initiative, however, has been widely derided here as belated political cover for the administration's attempts to build support for war.
In Egypt Mr. Mubarak's government has responded somewhat to pressures to democratize. In January, Mr. Mubarak appointed the first woman to the judiciary and declared the Orthodox Christmas, celebrated by the Coptic Christian minority, a national holiday.
Mr. Mubarak also appointed his son, Gamal, to a senior position in the National Democratic Party last year. But that appointment prompted rumors that the younger Mubarak is simply being groomed to take over as president -- hardly a sign of democracy.
Under pressure from the United States, including a threatened suspension of aid, a court in December released Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an Egyptian-American sociologist twice convicted in security courts for promoting greater voter participation in elections.
In January, he was retried, though this time before Egypt's highest civilian court. A new verdict is scheduled on March 18.
Mr. Ibrahim, 64 and frail from incarceration, is among the few who argue that war in Iraq could send democratic ripples through its Arab neighbors.
"Every qualitative change in this region was triggered by an external factor," he said in his small, cramped office at the American University in Cairo, where he has resumed teaching. 
Egypt, he said, "needs sustained pressure -- from within and without. Unfortunately, those here who would exert pressure are either in prison or pending trial. And so it must be external pressure."

HEADLINE: A Salesman for Bush's Tax Plan Who Has Belittled Similar Ideas 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
In nominating a respected Harvard economist as one of his top advisers, President Bush has now replaced nearly everyone from his original economic team with people who at one time spoke out against the kinds of policies Mr. Bush is prescribing.
 N. Gregory Mankiw, whom Mr. Bush nominated on Wednesday to lead his Council of Economic Advisers, wrote a popular economics textbook in which he ridiculed the supply-side tax cuts of President Ronald Reagan as "fad economics" conceived by "charlatans and cranks." 
 If Mr. Mankiw is confirmed by the Senate, which is likely, he would become one of the top three salesmen for an even bigger plan by President Bush to cut taxes by about $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years and let the government run big budget deficits for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Mankiw's comments have infuriated a number of prominent supply-side economists, including at least one who helped draft the Reagan tax cuts. Some of them question how Mr. Mankiw can credibly promote Mr. Bush's tax cut proposals in Congress, with business groups and among the public at large.
"It's stupid; it's simply not what a good economist writes," said Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute who served in the Reagan White House and also advised Mr. Bush during the presidential campaign. "Anybody who puts that in a textbook for tens of thousands of students to read has a lot of explaining to do."
But Mr. Bush's decision to recruit Mr. Mankiw and the other new members of the economic team reflects a pragmatic decision to install people who can project confidence at a time when the economy shows new signs of stalling and Democrats are gearing up for the next election.
Few people think the new team will waver over Mr. Bush's plans, but the president is nonetheless now relying on people who had no role in drafting the plan that they have to sell. 
White House officials dismissed criticisms of Mr. Mankiw today, saying he ranks among the nation's top macroeconomists and is solidly behind Mr. Bush's economic plans.
"The president nominated Professor Mankiw because he is an outstanding and talented economist who shares his view that tax cuts lead to higher growth," said Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman.
But Mr Mankiw, 44, (pronounced Man-CUE) is not the only person on Mr. Bush's team who has said things that appear at odds with the president's current policy. Democratic opponents have already jumped on those statements to undermine the credibility of plans.
And what worries some tax-cutting hard-liners is whether the new team will compromise more readily when negotiations in Congress reach a decisive point, or make somewhat different trade-offs from the original drafters of the proposals. With the Senate so closely divided, negotiations there are certain to be difficult.
John W. Snow, who took over as Treasury secretary this month, campaigned aggressively for a balanced federal budget in the mid-1990's, when the deficit was actually lower than it is projected to be this year.
Stephen Friedman, who recently took over as head of the White House National Economic Council, which is responsible for coordinating administration economic policy, was a board member of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan political group that pleads constantly for balancing the budget and has long infuriated the Bush administration.
Thus far, Mr. Snow and Mr. Friedman have swallowed any reservations about deficits they once had and become unflinching champions for the president's tax cut plan. Most analysts predict that Mr. Mankiw will provide equally solid support if he is confirmed by the Senate.
But Mr. Bush's decision to recruit all three men appears to reflect a calculation that their credentials on ideological purity are less important than their prestige as either business leaders or economic thinkers.
By most accounts, Mr. Mankiw enjoys enormous respect as a bright and prolific economist who has written best-selling textbooks as well as academic papers on topics ranging from consumer behavior to monetary policy and budget deficits.
"He is definitely not a supply-sider and definitely not a supporter of Reaganomics in the sense that Washington people talk about," said Dale Jorgenson, a professor of economics at Harvard and a longtime colleague of Mr. Mankiw. "But he is one of the top few macroeconomists in the country. He's also very well-organized and a very, very productive guy."
What has infuriated some advocates of Mr. Bush's tax-cutting plans are things that Mr. Mankiw wrote in his textbook, "Principles of Economics," first published in the late 1990's.
The textbook includes a section on President Reagan's economic policies, which, like those of President Bush, called for deep tax cuts and were based in part on the idea that tax cuts could help pay for themselves by producing faster economic growth.
In a section of his book entitled "Charlatans and Cranks," Mr. Mankiw ridiculed the Reagan policies as "fad economics" that were tantamount to "fad diets."
"An example of fad economics occurred in 1980," Mr. Mankiw wrote, "when a small group of economists advised presidential candidate Ronald Reagan that an across-the-board cut in income tax rates would raise revenue."
After reviewing the impact of Mr. Reagan's policies, which included a run of high budget deficits that lasted until the mid-1990's, Mr. Mankiw wrote that the moral of the experience was that "when politicians rely on the advice of charlatans and cranks, they rarely get the desirable results they anticipate."
In later editions of his textbook, Mr. Mankiw dropped the entire section on "charlatans and cranks" and muted his criticism. But he has not mended his fences with today's advocates of big new tax cuts.
"These insulting passages display an enormous level of ignorance about the economic reality of the 1980's," said Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a political group in Virginia that raises money for candidates who support Reagan-style tax cuts.
Mr. Moore said he wrote a letter pleading against Mr. Mankiw's nomination to Karl Rove, President Bush's top political adviser. But White House officials, who are still angry about Mr. Moore's complaints about Stephen Friedman, said today that they did not listen much to Mr. Moore.

HEADLINE: REBUILDING AT GROUND ZERO: OVERVIEW; 
PRACTICAL ISSUES FOR GROUND ZERO

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
In the end, it was not so much about architecture, about solemn memorial pits or soaring gardens in the sky. Instead, the decision announced yesterday to choose Daniel Libeskind's design for the World Trade Center site revolved mainly around politics, economics and engineering, people close to the selection process said.
 Almost immediately after the decision was announced, civic groups, downtown business leaders and others began debating the details that will be needed to put the plan into effect. 
 Many of those details also played a part in the selection of Mr. Libeskind. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg focused on economics at a briefing on the two finalist plans for the site, favoring the street life that the Libeskind plan would create, including a vibrant public plaza that would form a new crossroads of commerce and culture on the site, said people who attended a briefing for the mayor and others. 
Officials from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which oversaw the design competition, acted like engineers as they made their choice, according to those close to the process. They cast doubt on whether the latticework towers proposed by the losing architectural team, called Think, could be built at all and, if so, at what cost, said people who attended the briefing, given by the architects for Mr. Bloomberg, Gov. George E. Pataki and a committee overseeing the site plan selection.
Mr. Pataki was keenly attuned to the politics behind the choice, several participants in the process said.
The governor has long said that the memorial was the most important element of the designs, and he has listened closely to the desires of family members of those killed on Sept. 11, 2001. Family members told him that the Libeskind memorial sent the message that those victims would be remembered by a symbol of strength -- the slurry wall -- rather than by what they characterized as a pair of skeletal towers that recalled how their loved ones had died, said the participants in the meetings.
Referring to the latticework towers designed by the Think team, led by Rafael Vinoly and Frederic Schwartz, Roland W. Betts, a development corporation director who was chairman of the steering committee, said, "Many people looked at the Vinoly towers as something that would be a magnet, as an inspiration, for the city and the country and so on, that would propel tourism and commercial development.
"That's how I saw it. What I didn't realize was that other people saw it as the skeletons of the original towers and a constant reminder of the attack and of death." Between those two points of view, Mr. Betts said, "there is not a lot of middle ground." 
The plan is more significant for its placement of elements on the site than it is for the imagined commercial buildings rising toward the sky. The choice was made by Mr. Bloomberg and, even more so, by Mr. Pataki, who has wielded the most power over the rebuilding process from the beginning.
The governor said yesterday that the task now is "to make sure that the plan you see will become a reality." Many people doubted that officials from the state, the city, the Port Authority and dozens of city, state and federal governmental entities could cooperate to the degree necessary to create an inspiring plan, Mr. Pataki said. But they did, he said, allowing Mr. Libeskind to create "an inspiring symbol that will reach into the sky and that will let the world know that the terrorists have failed."
Mr. Pataki did not mention the Think team's design in his public remarks. But Lisa Stoll, a spokeswoman, said yesterday that he believed that the Vinoly plan would also have been "a tremendous symbol of New York's resilience." 
For 15 months, public officials, civic groups, family members and the general public have debated, often heatedly, the merits of a dozen different schemes for the rebuilding of the trade center. 
But yesterday, once the decision was made, many of the vestiges of anger and passion disappeared, and a vast majority of those who followed the process said they wanted to get on with the rebuilding. 
As if to illustrate that spirit, just before the presentation of the winning design began yesterday at the Winter Garden, the sparkling glass atrium adjacent to the trade center site, Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease rights to the World Trade Center's commercial space, approached Mr. Libeskind. 
A few weeks ago, Mr. Silverstein railed against the plans and said that he had the right to choose what would be built on the site. Yesterday, however, Mr. Silverstein clasped Mr. Libeskind on the shoulder and gave him a firm handshake, saying, "Congratulations."
William C. Rudin, the chairman of the Association for a Better New York, a civic group, said that although his organization had written a letter to rebuilding officials supporting the Think design, he was eager to see the Libeskind design succeed.
"The central thing now is to start implementing the transportation components and moving forward with the broader vision for downtown," Mr. Rudin said. "If government does their job in creating those amenities, then I think this design will help create a very exciting rebirth of Lower Manhattan."
And while various civic groups, architecture forums and public advocates have decried the lack of clarity about who was driving the decisions around the trade center, it would be hard to argue that the public did not have a chance to influence the debate.
"In response to the public comment, the process itself changed," Mr. Bloomberg said, with an entirely new design study begun after the public rejected six early proposals for the rebuilding. 
"It has been open and competitive. "It has been intensely debated. It is a subject everyone has strong opinions about. In other words, it has perfectly embodied the vitality and dynamism of New York."
The debates are not over, however. Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, which encompasses the trade center site, and who is also a director of the development corporation, said the Libeskind plan "has got a lot of great stuff, but it needs a lot of work."
"I don't look at this as anything close to a final plan," Ms. Wils said, adding that many downtown residents would like to see better connections between the site and neighborhoods to the south and west. 
Many family members have also expressed worry about a bus parking area proposed for the space beneath the memorial, where floors will be built across the lower part of the pit to shore up the slurry walls that hold back the underground waters of the Hudson River. The concern is that the parking area will be a safety hazard, that a bus could be used to deliver a bomb to the memorial site.
Port Authority officials estimate that the memorial will generate the need for parking up to 160 buses daily, and they have dismissed the safety concern, pledging a vigorous screening program. But they say they are not wedded to the idea of bus parking and could easily do without it. City officials and downtown residents have pushed for the underground parking, however, saying they don't want tourist buses clogging the streets. The city's Department of Transportation recently wrote a letter to the Port Authority saying that the department did not believe another area downtown could accommodate that many buses.
Many such details remain to be worked out, and the architects for the two teams struggled in the three weeks since they were named as finalists to address criticisms of their designs. 
Mr. Libeskind, for example, squared off the facades of many of his buildings, making them more amenable for developers and for ground-level retail stores, and he enhanced the area around the intersection of Greenwich and Fulton Streets, creating what one rebuilding official called "one of the world's most majestic crossroads."
The Think team, however, spent much of the last three weeks enhancing the design of its towers, making them lighter to allow them to stand atop the underground PATH terminal and changing the array of buildings that would be suspended within the towers. As a result, rebuilding officials said, the Think plan made little progress in addressing the ground-level public realm, a factor that weighed heavily in Mr. Bloomberg's support for the Libeskind plan. 
The resolution of those types of details are what, to many people, made the Libeskind plan the clear winner. 
"It succeeds both when it rises into the sky and when it descends into the ground," said John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the development corporation.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DISSENT; 
Labor, Breaking Tradition, Criticizes War Preparations

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Fla., Feb. 27 

 BODY:
After backing administrations in the Korean, Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars, the labor movement departed today from tradition and criticized President Bush's approach to a conflict with Iraq.
 At its winter meeting, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council unanimously approved a resolution urging Mr. Bush to embrace a broad multilateral approach to Iraq and criticizing the administration for dividing the world and insulting America's allies. 
 "The president has not fulfilled his responsibility to make a compelling and coherent explanation to the American people and the world as to the need for military action against Iraq at this time," the council, which represents 65 unions, said. "America has always been a peace-loving nation, slow to take up arms, and resolute in pursuit of diplomatic resolution to crises. This administration's actions are sadly eroding that reputation." 
That language is a sharp contrast to organized labor's stance in the Vietnam War, when the federation, under its president, George Meany, strongly supported the war effort. 
Several unions, as well as central labor councils in many cities, have approved resolutions denouncing the policy of pre-emptive strikes and threats to attack Iraq even without explicit United Nations approval. 
Within labor, differences go beyond nuance. Some unions, most notably the American Federation of Teachers, are more willing to accept a unilateral approach. A few liberal unions appear dead set against war.
The unions are unanimous in denouncing President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. The resolution called Mr. Hussein "a demagogue and a despot with an appalling human rights record" who "rules the Iraqi people through torture, murder and fear."
The federation said it supported efforts to disarm Iraq but added, "This is best achieved in concert with a broad international coalition of allies and with the sanction of the United Nations."
The federation faulted the administration for its diplomacy and failure to build a consensus, noting that there is far less unity in the United States and with allies than there was after the Sept. 11 attacks.
"Now, just a year and a half later, we have squandered much of that good will, managed to insult many of our strong allies and divided the world at a time when it should speak as one," the resolution said. 
"We're saying that war should be an absolutely last resort, and in the strongest terms we're urging the administration to go through the U.N.," said the federation's international affairs director, Barbara Shailor. "We can't go around insulting our allies. In a world filled with terrorism, we need all the friends we can get."
Ms. Shailor said unions would overwhelmingly back a war if the Security Council gave a green light.
The federation's international affairs committee drafted the resolution and invited two Clinton administration figures, Samuel R. Berger, national security adviser, and Dennis B. Ross, special Mideast envoy, to give detailed briefings on Iraq.
Union leaders gave several reasons for departing from the strong support in past wars. In the cold war, most union leaders were fervently anti-Communist, a major reason that labor backed the Vietnam War. Members often conducted counterdemonstrations at antiwar rallies. 
With labor clashing with Mr. Bush over many issues, several leaders said they felt less inhibited about criticizing his foreign policy, even over an issue as serious as war. 
Most unions backed President George Bush in the gulf war, although some leaders, echoing many Democratic lawmakers, urged him to wait longer before attacking. The president of the federation, Lane Kirkland, said, "The American labor movement stands in full support of our country" to "bring this conflict to an early and decisive conclusion."
Several leaders said the increased power and role of women and minorities in labor might have also made the movement more averse to war.
The United Farm Workers, citing the teachings of its founder, Cesar Chavez, said, "President Bush has not offered convincing evidence to the American people that war is needed, because Iraq poses an imminent threat to the country. Such a use of U.S. military force would require thousands of young men and women, many of them people of color, to fight overseas."
In its resolution, the teachers' union said that military action "will only have the support of the American people if they believe that such action is only a last resort." The union added that it "recognizes that the U.S. may at times have to act unilaterally in defense of its national security."
Several unions said the administration was pushing for a war for political gain and to distract the public from economic troubles. The Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, or Unite, approved a resolution saying, "This war is a cynical attempt to distract attention away from the real concerns of American citizens -- a faltering economy, declining education budgets, state and local fiscal crises, increasing unemployment."
The union president, Bruce Raynor, said: 
"If our policy is to topple horrible regimes, I'm not sure if Saddam's in the top five. North Korea seems like a worse regime, and Myanmar may be even more repressive toward its people."
Many unions sought to make clear they supported American troops, regardless of the stand on war.
The Cleveland Central Labor Council, representing 100,000 workers, approved a resolution saying, "If our nation goes to war, absent demonstrably legitimate concerns about weapons of mass destruction, we will continue to express our opposition to that war, while finding meaningful ways to support our troops."

HEADLINE: Albany Ponders Borrowing: Not Whether to Do It, but How 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
What it has come to after a month of debate over Gov. George E. Pataki's budget proposal is this: a stare-down among state leaders, not about whether to borrow billions of dollars to pay day-to-day expenses, something repugnant to financial analysts, but about how to do the borrowing. 
 Mr. Pataki and his Democratic rival, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, have proposed plans to borrow about $4.2 billion to cover more than a third of the state's cumulative $11.5 billion budget gap. Borrowing is at the center of the budget-balancing proposals in the Capitol, though there is strong disagreement over which plan to follow. 
 The fight over borrowing can seem petty to voters, part of the general dysfunction of a place that often cannot get past proposals and positioning. But the voices in the Capitol hallways have been shrill ever since Mr. Pataki announced the details of his $90.8 billion budget. 
Borrowing is not uncommon in other statehouses. Many Republican governors and legislators, following the lead of President Bush, are refusing to raise taxes, viewing tax hikes as a further drag on the economy. Instead, states are considering floating bonds, lots of them, to close gaps. 
In New York, borrowing has been a favorite budget-balancing device since the days of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and has seemed at times a rite of spring. The result, said the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, is that New York is now the largest debtor among states, on track to have $42.6 billion in loans outstanding by 2008. 
That is a glass ceiling that most lawmakers do not want to break because every dollar borrowed has a cost that future taxpayers will have to bear. And yet Mr. Pataki, a Republican, is imploring legislators to pass a law to seize $4.2 billion worth of revenue the state is owed from a 1998 settlement with tobacco companies. The estimated $10.4 billion in remaining payments would otherwise trickle in at a rate of about $500 million a year over the next 20 years, and be used to help fund health programs. 
Across an ever-widening gulf is Mr. Silver, who has voiced a flat-out "No" to the governor's idea. But his chamber would replace it with a borrowing plan of their own: issuing $3.5 billion worth of 10-year bonds, which would be repaid with a revenue stream set aside from future income-tax collections.
Mr. Silver would also borrow $710 million more from the state's so-called rainy day fund (interest free) for a total of $4.2 billion, matching the governor's borrowing plan.
Even veteran budget analysts find it hard to explain precisely how each plan works or to forecast how either would affect the long-term financial health of the state. 
Fundamentally, lawmakers, economists and others say there is not much practical difference between the two plans. Many on Wall Street consider each plan tantamount to deficit financing. As the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, put it, borrowing to pay salaries and other operating costs -- rather than to build bridges or roads -- is as bad as it gets in municipal finance.
"When you have to choose between these two proposals, you are basically being asked to pick your poison," said E. J. McMahon, an analyst with the conservative Manhattan Institute. "Instead of talking about which way to borrow, I wish they would talk about how to borrow less first, or, to borrow not at all."
But the governor and Mr. Silver see big differences in their proposals and, analysts say, at this late date there are few other options.
The governor himself has worked for years to reform the way the state incurs debt, and backed a law in 2000 barring just the sort of borrowing Mr. Silver proposed. But state spending has outpaced inflation for years. Since Wall Street began its slide in 2000 and terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, the state's fiscal picture has steadily worsened. 
And even with some spending restrictions imposed this year, a $2.2 billion gap remains in the budget that ends March 31. That will be on top of a $9.3 billion gap the next year.
To end this year in balance, the state is delaying payment on certain bills, like school aid, fringe benefits and higher education reimbursements. But Robert A. Kurtter, senior vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, said those kinds of shifts are the first sign of true fiscal disarray, akin to New York City's fiscal mess in the 1970's.
Mr. Pataki says the state needs the tobacco borrowing so it does not run out of cash. 
"The governor's tobacco securitization proposal, which has been before the Legislature for nearly three months, is clearly a more fiscally responsible course of action," said Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget. 
The governor's aides said using the tobacco revenue all at once is not a matter of incurring new debt but of selling a state asset. Bonds would be sold to private investors, so the state could get the cash. The state would then use about $6.5 billion worth of future revenue from the tobacco settlement to pay bondholders.
It is an expensive solution, financial experts say, and the market is saturated with tobacco bonds. Thirteen other states, in addition to municipalities, have been selling all or part of their shares at higher interest rates than income-tax backed bonds. 
Aides to the governor said, however, that Mr. Silver's plan would be the first time the state would finance a deficit with long-term bonds. Mr. Silver said that it is the governor who is taking that drastic step.
Further, Mr. Silver said it was preposterous not to consider tobacco borrowing as debt. He said his plan would cost less, some $1.1 billion over 10 years, because it is cheaper to borrow against tax revenues than enter the tobacco bond market, arguments that the governor disputes. 
Mr. Silver also argues that Mr. Pataki's plan would drain $420 million in tobacco money from the state's Health Care Reform Act, which finances 45 health-related programs. The governor has made up for that loss by using a series of one-time windfalls and by cutting back health programs.
Mr. Silver said the question of whether to cut spending cannot be answered now. Critics fear that his bond plan is simply a way to increase spending by raising a new pot of revenue, rather than addressing budget largesse.
Mr. Bruno supports the tobacco plan, though he is troubled by cuts in health programs. He has been trying to negotiate an agreement between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Silver, even delaying a vote this past Tuesday on tobacco borrowing as a sign of good faith, and his staff has been analyzing Mr. Silver's plan.
On Wall Street, opinion is split on which plan would more seriously hurt the state's long-term fiscal outlook. Fitch and Standard & Poor's, two bond raters, have not downgraded the state, though they saw the tobacco plan in December.
Some analysts said Mr. Pataki's 20-year bonds, with a mechanism for payment in 12 years, were too long-term and costly. But Colleen Woodell, managing director in public finance at Standard & Poor's, said that plan was preferable because it does not require taxes to be used for bond payments.
In the end, there will be borrowing, because time is running out, said Elizabeth A. Lynam, director of state studies for the Citizens Budget Commission. "That is part of the terrible consequence that no one wanted to talk about the deficit for eight months of the fiscal year," she said. "It is kind of an acknowledgment that there has not been anyone at the helm. They have sort of let things run their course."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SECURITY COUNCIL; 
Antiwar Fever Puts Mexico In Quandary On Iraq Vote

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON with CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Mexico holds one of the potentially decisive votes on the United Nations Security Council for an American-sponsored resolution authorizing war against Iraq. But its president is in a quandary about how to cast it.
 Like other leaders around the world, President Vicente Fox has a citizenry overwhelming opposed to war -- between 70 and 83 percent, polls show. Anti-American attitudes have surfaced in political and intellectual circles, and he desperately needs public support for midterm elections, three months away. 
 But Mexico also shares a 2,000-mile border with the United States, and no country in the world sends more illegal immigrants across a border than Mexico does to the United States. Moreover, since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement 10 years ago, perhaps no other country depends more on the United States for its economic well-being as does Mexico. 
Mr. Fox's predicament was captured in a cartoon published in the Mexican newspaper Reforma: the president wobbles with a balance pole on a high wire, a small dove of peace perched at one end of the pole, a hulking American eagle on the other. Many political analysts think Mr. Fox will ultimately tilt toward the eagle.
After a telephone conversation with President Bush last weekend, Mr. Fox moved away from unequivocal calls for peace, warning that Saddam Hussein must disarm.
"The only path toward peace is the disarmament of Iraq," he said in a speech on Tuesday before a meeting of Mexican and American business leaders. "The world wants peace, but only the disarmament of the Iraqis can assure peace."
The statement marked a subtle but clear departure for Mr. Fox, whose speeches about Iraq had previously echoed Pope John Paul II's urgent appeals for peace. At an event nine days ago and again last week, Mr. Fox publicly prayed for peace. Then, in a speech to Mexico's military, he said Mexico was "against unilateralism and against war." As late as last week, he issued a call of "No to war." 
Mr. Fox's positions remain wobbly, strategically couched and ambiguous, as this country prepares to vote on a United Nations resolution supported by the United States, Great Britain and Spain that would lead to military action against Iraq.
While his language may be ambiguous, the reason for his ambiguity is clear. If Mexico follows Washington's lead, said a political analyst, Gabriel Guerra, "the sign we will have given is that we do not have an independent foreign policy, that we cannot be a voice and a player on the international stage, because at the end of the day we do not have a backbone."
More than just reflecting domestic political concerns, however, Mr. Fox's reluctance to support the United States is also the latest display of how his relationship with Mr. Bush has cooled.
"The relationship has taken a negative turn," Mr. Guerra said. "Apart from a honeymoon of rhetoric, Mexico never won anything substantive."
The honeymoon began when Mr. Bush chose Mexico for his first foreign trip as president, in February 2001. He agreed to begin work on an immigration accord sought by Mr. Fox, which could have given legal status to some 3.5 million undocumented Mexicans working in the United States.
Those talks were put off indefinitely after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. Since then, Mr. Fox has been unable to make significant advances for his country on a range of issues, including Mexico's water debt with the United States, the execution of Mexican nationals on death row and various agricultural trade issues. In January, the frustrated architect of Mexico's immigration proposals, Jorge G. Castaneda, resigned as foreign minister.
At the other end of North America, Canada, which does not hold a seat on the Security Council, has also been wavering on the Iraq issue. For months, Prime Minister Jean Chretien and senior officials have contradicted themselves on whether Iraq posed an immediate threat, and what position Canada would take if the United States and Great Britain unilaterally invaded Iraq without the approval of the United Nations
But Mr. Chretien has moved more clearly toward Washington, offering a compromise Security Council resolution that calls for Iraq to disarm by March 28 or face war.
"Saddam Hussein is the one who can avoid war, by respecting Resolution 1441 and by respecting the United Nations," Mr. Chretien said.
Today, both presidents issued more calls for Iraq to disarm in bilateral meetings here. At a news conference, Mr. Fox denied that his views on the war had shifted toward those of the United States, saying that Mexico would maintain its "independence and autonomy." And he said that Mexico would take some of the points of Canada's proposal into discussions before the Security Council.
"We are opposed to war, like all the world, and as long as there are alternatives, that is our goal," Mr. Fox said, adding: "If Saddam and Iraq are not going to comply with the demands of the inspectors, then things change. Without a doubt, they change for the whole world."

About 100,000 Egyptians gathered in Cairo for one of the largest protests so far in the Arab world against an American-led war. The rally was allowed by President Hosni Mubarak's government, though it was organized by labor unions, opposition parties and a banned Islamic organization. A12

She is the only woman indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for Yugoslavia, and she is also the only leader to have acknowledged guilt and shown remorse. A4

A Scottish Boondoggle
Dauntingly overbudget and overdue, the grandiose building that will one day house the Scottish Parliament and that is derisively called "Follywood" is increasingly being seen as a symbol of the body's struggle for credibility. A10

NATIONAL A16-23

In a contentious exchange over the costs of war with Iraq, the Pentagon's second-ranking official disparaged a top Army general's assessment of the number of troops needed to secure post-war Iraq. A1

A1

Fireworks Request at Issue
A day after the tour manager for the band whose pyrotechnics ignited the fire that killed 96 people at a nightclub in Rhode Island testified before a grand jury, his lawyer said the manager had confirmed a week before the performance that the club "wanted pyrotechnics." A14

Bicyclist Is Granted Asylum
An Iranian man who cycled 46,000 miles around the world on a six-year peace mission, only to be arrested in Arizona for entering the country illegally, was granted political asylum by an immigration judge. A16

More Pragmatism Than Art In 9/11 Design Selection
The decision to select Daniel Libeskind's design for the World Trade Center site revolved not so much around architecture, solemn memorial pits or soaring gardens in the sky as it did around politics, economics and engineering, people close to the selection process said. A1

Suspect in Nursing Home Fire
A 23-year-old woman with a history of emotional problems and drug abuse is the primary suspect in the fast-moving fire at a nursing home in Hartford, police officials said. B1
