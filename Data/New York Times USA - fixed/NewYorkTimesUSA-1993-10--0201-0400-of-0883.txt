HEADLINE: Economy Seen Growing at 3%

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., Oct. 7

 BODY:
A joint report today by 16 economists for the nation's largest corporations predicted that the American economy would grow 3 percent for the second half of this year and through all of 1994.
The survey was presented at the semiannual meeting here of the Business Council, a group comprising the chief executives of 100 of the nation's largest corporations. 
 By contrast, a survey three weeks ago of 51 academic, corporate and financial economists found that the average forecast was for 2.6 percent growth for the second half of this year and 2.7 percent growth next year.

HEADLINE: Bosnian Calls for New Approach to End Civil War

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Saying current Geneva peace talks have left him with a choice between "a just defensive war and an unjust peace," the President of the Muslim-dominated Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina called today for a new approach to negotiating an end to the civil war.
In talks with members of the Security Council and subsequently at a news conference, the Bosnian leader, Alija Izetbegovic, said he was tired of negotiations that after a year still have not produced an agreement acceptable to the Muslims. He said he favored a new round of talks similar to those held by representatives of more than 20 countries in London last August and which authorized the Geneva peace initiative. 
 "We think it is better to negotiate than to wage war, and if we have to negotiate our preference is for the London type rather than the Geneva type," Mr. Izetbegovic said.
His thinking appears to coincide, at least in part, with that of Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators running the Geneva talks, who in recent days have been expressing skepticism about their mission and suggesting a new initiative that would seek a broader settlement covering problems in the rest of the old Yugoslav federation as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
But the Bosnian leader also made clear that he wanted any such search for a new and more comprehensive peace agreement to be based on the principles adopted by the London conference, which include the return of people forcibly expelled from their homes, the relinquishing of territory acquired by force and the right of all refugees to return to their homes.
These principles have all been endorsed by the Security Council in the many resolutions it has adopted on the Bosnian civil war. But the only peace terms Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg have been able to persuade Serbs and Croats to accept do not fully respect them because they allow Serbs to keep conquered land and divide the country into ethnic states. And it is largely for this reason that the Bosnian Muslims are still rejecting these terms.
 
Demands for More Land
 In his address to the General Assembly today, Mr. Izetbegovic repeated previous demands that Muslims receive more land under any agreement splitting the country into three ethnic states as well as concrete guarantees by NATO that it will use military power to enforce the settlement terms if necessary.
He also called on the United States to supply troops for such a force, saying it was the duty of the world's sole superpower to uphold international law.
Mr. Izetbegovic complained bitterly that the Security Council had been passing resolution after resolution calling on the Serbs to lift their siege of Sarajevo, pull back artillery and other heavy weapons, stop hindering aid convoys and cut off the flow of arms to Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but without taking any action to enforce them.
He also appeared to be steeling himself for a second winter at war, despite the hardships this will impose on his people, saying that "with the coming of winter more help will be needed if our wounded and malnourished population is to avoid finally succumbing to starvation, disease and exposure."
The grim plight that many people in the whole of the former Yugoslavia face this winter will be underscored in Geneva on Friday, when the United Nations will ask for $696.5 million in addition to buy enough food, clothing, fuel and medicine to last them until next June.
In a joint letter to donor countries, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, and Jan Eliasson, the aid coordinator, warn that some 4.3 million people are likely to need assistance in these territories this winter, or about 10 percent more than the United Nations was caring for last March.
"Resources and reserves are rapidly running out, economies have plummeted further, the numbers of displaced people have grown throughout the year and infrastructures continue to collapse -- all at a time when prospects for peace are dwindling," these officials say in their letter.

HEADLINE: Gunmen and Police Brutally Enforce Strike in Haiti

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 7

 BODY:
One day after United States and Canadian forces started to arrive, plainclothes gunmen opposed to the restoration of democracy in Haiti sprayed automatic-weapons fire at street merchants and successfully shut down this city.
The gunmen collaborated openly with uniformed Haitian police, the very forces who are supposed to be retrained by international police experts as part of a diplomatic settlement of Haiti's political crisis. 
 At least two people were seriously wounded when gunmen fired on merchants who failed to heed a call for a general strike. The gunmen also turned back the few buses that ventured onto empty streets and even chased residents back into their homes.
Over 200 of the gunmen, known as attaches, gathered this morning at the main public square, mingling openly with heavily armed uniformed police. Later in the morning, one group of foreigners was stopped by plainclothesmen brandishing machine guns and hand grenades and warned to get off the streets.
 
First Foreign Troops Arrive
 The intimidation campaign came as 50 Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrived on the second day of what is intended to be a rapid buildup of 1,300 foreign police officers and soldiers.
On Wednesday, 26 United States soldiers, mostly doctors, engineers and linguists, flew here as an advance team for about 250 others, who are scheduled to arrive Monday. Five Canadian police officers arrived with the first Americans.
No foreign forces were involved in confrontations with armed Haitians.
Today's strike, and a demonstration scheduled for Friday, both organized by a shadowy group that calls itself the Front for Advancement and Progress, seem intended to shake the resolve of the international community to restore the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power on Oct. 30, as planned.
Diplomats said Haitians who oppose the return of Father Aristide after his two-year exile hope to scare off those trying to reinstate him by making Haiti appear too volatile for a delicate political transition to take place.
 
Just Side Arms, or Maybe None
 Those engaged in the anti-Aristide offensive, which diplomats say is being led by the police commander, Col. Joseph Michel Francois, are also taking advantage of the tightly restrictive rules of engagement for the lightly armed United Nations force.
When armed at all, the 670 or so Americans being deployed and a similar number of foreign police officers will carry only side arms. The foreign forces, whose mission is to help separate Haiti's police from the Army and to retrain both corps, are prohibited from intervening in any way to stop any violence they may witness.
"If these people have guns, the police have even bigger guns," said an elderly Haitian, one of the few pedestrians downtown this morning.
Like other Haitians who have lived through massacres and years of Army-backed repression, he said he had no doubt that those opposed to Father Aristide would use whatever force they felt they needed to stop his return.
Diplomats said Father Aristide's opponents are also counting heavily on a shift in Congressional and public opinion in the United States against risky international peacekeeping ventures. Such sentiment has mounted sharply since Sunday, when 12 United States soldiers were killed in Somalia.
 
Recover Is Slow to Nonexistent
 Finally, with only three weeks to go until the President's scheduled return, his opponents are capitalizing on delays in carrying out the political settlement that was brokered by the United Nations and signed on July 3 in New York.
At the time, diplomats who led the talks painted a picture of a Haiti whose shattered economy would be well on its way to being refloated, its Army well along in its retraining and its Government firmly seated and productive, well before Father Aristide's return.
Instead, Haiti has been bogged down in rising violence, government gridlock and continued economic misery. Because of the insecurity, members of the President's transitional Government, including Prime Minister Robert Malval, have been forced to work out of their homes.
In another delay, only slightly more than 200 of the 567 international police experts who are to be sent to Haiti, most from Candada and France, have been recruited.
 
Sharing the Blame
 Haitian political experts say the blame for this must be shared between a diplomatic corps with little experience in this country's affairs and an Army that is skilled at blocking progress at every step.
Diplomats and Cabinet members met today for three hours with the Army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, to discuss the deteriorating situation.
"The Army has failed to fulfill its constitutional role of providing security," a Cabinet member said after the meeting.
Participants in the meeting said General Cedras, for his part, sought renewed assurances that an offer of amnesty by Father Aristide was airtight.

HEADLINE: Fewer Florio Foes Take to the Air

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The voice had the high-pitched quality of a wail, the sound heard in hospital emergency rooms or combat zones, filled with anguish and incomprehension.
"What's the matter with people?" asked a middle-aged woman calling in to New Jersey 101.5 talk radio. "Don't they remember what Jim Florio did to this state? Now they're going to vote for him? Am I going crazy?" 
 The talk-show host, Jay Sorenson, assured the caller she had a solid grip on reality. The ones who had lost their marbles, he told her, were people who wanted to impeach the Governor three years ago but now say they will vote for him next month.
Perhaps more than any other forum, the talk shows on Mr. Sorenson's radio station led the charge that in 1990-91 gave structure to the angry public reaction to passage of Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax program.
 
Feuding Factions
 It was on the station's call-in shows that John Budzash, a letter carrier, and Pat Ralston, a real-estate title searcher, got together to form Hands Across New Jersey. Within a year the grass-roots anti-tax group had enough muscle to gather more than 800,000 signatures on a petition and seemed to be placing an indelible "throw the rascals out" stamp on state politics.
Today the group has splintered into feuding, name-calling factions. And less than four weeks before the election, the chat on 101.5 (only rarely referred to by its call letters, WKXW-FM) turns more to beefs about driving conditions on state roads than to politics.
The upshot is that the campaign is being played out without the raucous anti-Florio soundtrack that played so effectively in the 1990 election when Christine Todd Whitman nearly unseated Senator Bill Bradley, and a year later when Republicans seized control of the Legislature.
"We reflect the mood of our listeners, and if they're agitated they're going to be agitated on the air," said Perry Michael Simon, program director at the station, which claims a weekly audience of more than 500,000 in central New Jersey. "If they're more complacent, that will come across as well."
He said that the Florio foes who have been calling the station for three years were still around but that other voices were expressing disappointment with Mrs. Whitman.
"The mood out there isn't as much kindly disposed to Florio as much as it's dispirited about the alternative," he said. "With a choice like that it's no wonder we're not seeing the kind of fervor we did a few years back."
The drop in passion has not eroded the station's ratings, which shot up in the political firestorm it helped fan in 1990, shortly after it was acquired by its present owners, Press Broadcasting.
The influence of Hands Across New Jersey, by contrast, has sharply declined.
It has been bloodied by the hard-knuckled blows Mr. Budzash and Mrs. Ralston have exchanged since he quit as as the president of the group in 1991, claiming it was being taken over by Republicans.
The group went on to endorse Republican candidates in the 1991 legislative races, but after the party won control of the Legislature its leaders dashed the group's hopes for action on term limits and a constitutional amendment providing for legislation through binding public referendum.
Rank-and-file members drifted into Ross Perot's United We Stand campaign last year, and the protest group settled back into the silent tapestry of ordinary life from which it had emerged so dramatically.
"Populist movements are difficult to sustain over a long period of time," observed Larry Bartels, a professor of communications and public affairs at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School. "They were able to throw the rascals out, but nothing changed for them."
Mrs. Ralston and her board of directors claim the group still represents 10,000 voters "and has 50,000 names still in our data base." They endorsed Mrs. Whitman in the Republican primary and have indicated she will have the group's support in the general election. On Wednesday Mrs. Ralston said "tens of thousands of dollars" will be spent on cable television and radio ads the organization will start broadcasting next week saying that Mr. Florio's tax policies are to blame for widespread unemployment and mortgage foreclosures.
"We still believe there's still a lot of anger out there and when people step into the voting booth they'll pull the lever against Jim Florio," said Bill Green, a state director who lost his job in the recession.
Mr. Budzash, who made a brief attempt to get on the Democratic primary ballot last spring, now says he is prepared to vote for Mr. Florio because Mrs. Whitman has not offered any substance "that adds up to a hill of beans."
"Hey, a lot of people are just like me," he said. "They can't believe it, but they're voting for Florio."
Mr. Simon, the program director 0f 101.5, said he believed many voters have pushed the 1990 uproar over taxes out of their minds. "It's like a nagging injury you learn to live with," he said.
Another host, Brook Daniels, who favors Mrs. Whitman in her on-air comments, said that if she had been told six months ago that Mr. Florio would be leading any candidate -- even Attila the Hun -- "I'd have you committed."
"It's like everyone's had a frontal lobotomy and forgotten what happened three years ago," he said.
Her co-host, Roberta Gale, who is partial to Mr. Florio -- "I'd rather gouge my eyes out than vote for Christine Todd Whitman" -- says she misses the hurly-burly of the old days when the switchboard would light up with livid anti-Florio calls.
"Now it shocks me every time I open the microphone and I don't hear that pitch of anger," she says.
Still, when she thinks about it, there is an explanation. "People eventually get bored with everything -- marriages, relationship, their cars. Why not this?"

HEADLINE: Vacant Lots, Except for Red Tape;
New York Tries to Improve Management of 14,000 Parcels

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
For the last six years, Rudolph Graves has been trying to buy the patch of dirt -- a haunt for drug addicts, prostitutes and car thieves, who slip in at night to strip vehicles -- that sits next to his restaurant in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. He wants to convert it to an outdoor dining patio.
But, he says, during most of that time the city, which owns the lot, has presented him with a maze-like bureaucracy that often didn't answer or return his calls. The city had no particular policy for what to do with such land, but it did have one rule -- it could not sell the land directly to anyone. 
 The real estate that Mr. Graves covets is one of more than 14,000 city-owned parcels of vacant land, ranging from garden-sized slivers to block-long prairies, much of it in poor communities and taken from owners who did not pay taxes. After years of criticism that this land was either being sold indiscriminately at open auctions or left to stand fallow for no good reason, the city is trying to balance its duty to generate revenue with its responsibility to nurture impoverished neighborhoods. It is fashioning long-term strategies to dispose of the land through auctions, leases and development projects.
The city is now saying that the lot Mr. Graves wants next to his restaurant, Rudy's Raves, at 214 Tapscott Street, will be offered at auction in February, with bidding restricted to owners of adjacent properties, finally providing Mr. Graves with a clear avenue to his goal.
"There should be some help for the mom-and-pop store," Mr. Graves said of his bureaucratic odyssey. "They don't care. I can't believe they feel that way. You get your entrepreneurs from the small businesses."
Urban planners and open-space advocates say New York and other cities need to devise creative solutions to managing their vast land inventories. Cities, they say, must make acquisition easier for neighborhood groups and small businesses intent on expansion, especially in areas where the real-estate market is as moribund as the weed-covered landscapes.
"For every vacant lot, you should be thinking about what we are trying to do and who are we serving," said Kathy Madden, an environmental designer with the Project for Public Spaces, which advises communities on urban design. "Are we trying to build communities or make the most money off our land? It makes you question the purpose of land."
During the 1980's, the city owned so many properties that it held as many as six two-day auctions over a year, placing hundreds of properties up for sale at a time. Often sold without development restrictions, the result was a crazy quilt of speculators. Some sat on the land, hoping for an economic upsurge. Others built parking lots, motels and garages that provided profits for them but were often eyesores and magnets of crime for the neighborhoods.
 
Less Selling, More Planning
 Recognizing these failures, city officials say they have decreased the amount of land sold at auction, increased communication among various agencies that may have a use for the land and have started a broad series of land-disposition studies to guide future public and private development efforts.
"Philosophically, I could see ourselves as an asset manager for these properties, getting maximum value and minimizing risk," said Randi E. Gordon, deputy commissioner at the Division of Real Property, which manages much of the city's vacant land. "Usually that's talked about in dollar terms. But we look at assets not just in dollar terms but in making good decisions on how a parcel should be used."
There is a similar debate in other parts of the country, as cities try to revive depopulated areas with parks and other amenities or reclaim unused commercial land for new economic programs.
Gerri Spilka, a partner in Organization and Management Group Inc., a community development consulting company in Philadelphia that assesses how various cities manage their vacant land, said that many cities lacked coordinated development strategies beyond the usual moneymaker of open auctions.
 
Stuck in Model of 1950's
 "Despite all the talk," she said, "cities are stuck in a paradigm of the 1950's, which means land is still very valuable in cities, or we have a dense city. It hasn't caught up with a depopulated urban situation."
On the Federal level, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, has introduced the Abandoned Land Reuse Act, a bill that seeks to offer incentives for cleaning up and recycling abandoned or underused industrial areas and transforming them into commercial and industrial centers.
In 1991, New York City's Department of City Planning began a review of 24 neighborhood land-disposition plans, which recommended how vacant plots could be used for low-income housing, parks and business expansion. The studies -- eight have been released -- are being used by city agencies, including those on the City Land Commission, the interagency panel that rules on the disposition of city properties.
"This is an enormous resource," said Richard L. Schaffer, the department's director. "When you talk about an array of communities where the city owns substantial amounts of land, these present an enormous planning opportunity."
 
Selling Fewer Properties
 Ms. Gordon said that the Division of Real Property was selling fewer properties, and that half the parcels under her jurisdiction were not being offered at the request of various city agencies that were considering building on the land. About 1,300 pieces are being leased to community gardening groups, and 1,000 others are being leased to private individuals, often with restrictions on their use.
In some areas, vacant land is being managed to complement the rebuilding of affordable housing, adding small commercial strips to cater to the newly-arrived residents. Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said his agency was helping to put together three neighborhood retail centers in Brooklyn. He said it was taking several blocks of abandoned land and selling them at a discount to developers who are to build strip-malls that will serve as small-business incubators.
Despite criticisms that his agency favors bigger projects, Mr. Weisbrod said that small-business owners like Mr. Graves, intent on acquiring small, adjacent parcels, were also being assisted.
More difficult to manage are the lots whose sale has been postponed. While some of these are temporarily leased to community groups or private individuals, others become dumping grounds or are taken over illegally.
Isabel Irizarry lives on Tiebout Avenue in the Fordham section of the Bronx. Down the street, a lot that was leased for storage instead became an unlicensed parking lot that is packed with dozens of cars. Nearby, another vacant lot, which she and her community hope to obtain for a garden, is being used as a dumping ground by workmen building an annex for Public School 9.
Lori Fierstein, first assistant commissioner at the Real Property Division, said the lot was being used illegally. She and other officials know that illegal uses and dumping occur on city property, but they have few resources to monitor such violations and must rely on community groups to alert them.
Open-space advocates said one solution would be for the city to allocate more vacant land for parks and community centers in neighborhoods that have few such existing amenities. They said that holding onto the land for possible future sale or development may be unrealistic in the most blighted areas.
"Interim use has a profound effect on whether a community goes into future decline," said Linda Davidoff, executive director of the Parks Council, a nonprofit group that has established community gardens in some low-income communities. Her organization has been working on a report that calls for establishing as many as 500 more acres of community gardens at a cost of $195 million over 10 years.
 
'Not a Trivial Issue'
 "The physical appearance of a community is not a trivial issue," she said. "It goes to the core of whether a city cares for this community. When you get up in the morning it matters if you see a wasteland or see a garden."
The difference matters to James Robinson, who speeds to emergencies as the founder of the Bed-Stuy Volunteer Ambulance Corps. His ambulances and command center sit on a gravelly city-owned lot that he and his partner wrested from crack dealers and occupied illegally until the city granted them a lease.
Mr. Robinson and officials in the Brooklyn Borough President's office said the city tried earlier this year to put the land up for auction without telling them. City officials said the land was never up for auction and that Mr. Robinson had failed to follow up on discussions two years ago about obtaining the land.
Officials at the property division now say they are appraising the property and examining ways to see if they can help Mr. Robinson. He said the city should just donate it to his cash-starved group as a community service.
"It was easier dealing with the drug dealers," said Mr. Robinson. "Once you beat them they disappeared. The city is an ongoing thing. With them it's one bureaucrat after another. They keep coming after you."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Against Yen But Gains in Other Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar eased against the Japanese yen yesterday but firmed against most European currencies as dealers focused on the economic problems there.
The German mark also posted gains as nervous investors sold other European currencies. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.94 yen, down from 105.75 yen on Wednesday. But the dollar was virtually unchanged at 1.6228 marks, up from 1.6225 marks.
Among other currencies, the Belgian franc and the Spanish peseta were hit hard on fears that negotiations on changing the social laws in those countries would drag on and hurt their economies. Belgium and Spain have large budget deficits.
The Belgian central bank bought Belgian francs for marks in an effort to stem the losses in its currency, dealers said.
 Aside from the activity in Europe, foreign exchange trading was quiet. Most dealers remained sidelined before the release today of the September employment data in the United States.
Many are hoping the report on jobs will jolt the market out of its recent torpor by lending clues on the United States recovery. A report in line with the expectations of economists for a 155,000 increase in jobs could have limited impact, dealers said.
 
Little New in Japan Plan
 "If we get something below 100,000, the dollar will fall, and with something above 200,000, we could see some upside," said Jack Griffin, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at Fuji Bank.
Dealers said a trade initiative announced by Japan yesterday had little new to offer, and they suspected Washington would continue to pressure Tokyo to make bigger concessions.
Japan pledged to work toward a "highly significant cut" in its current account surplus, which hit a record in August, and promote smooth economic relations with other countries.
The British pound finished in New York at $1.5235, down from $1.5245 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates compared with Wednesday's quotes: 1.4248 Swiss francs, up from 1.4230; 5.6760 French francs, up from 5.6680; 1,606 Italian lire, up from 1,591, and 1.3355 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3343.

The Calm Before the Jobs Figures

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Treasury market has gone through a remarkably slow four days with bond prices barely budging. But many investors and traders expect today's employment figures to jolt the market, one way or another.
Analysts said this week was the slowest in recent memory, save for holiday and year-end periods. They said the sluggishness was caused in part by indecision in advance of what many consider the month's most important economic report. Yesterday, the price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond moved within an extremely narrow range of just 5/32 point in either direction. 
 Its yield, which moves inversely from price, closed at 6.01 percent, unchanged from Wednesday and barely changed from the finish over the last six trading sessions.
This week's unusually light trading volume and tight price ranges, analysts said, suggest that investors are nervous about jobless figures that are closely watched but highly dependent on hard-to-assess factors.
 
Last Month's Surprise
 Last month was a good example. Economists had expected a gain of around 150,000 jobs at nonagricultural businesses in August, but the Government reported that businesses shed 39,000 from their payrolls.
Employment is seen as a good indicator of economic strength and is important to the bond market. Weaker-than-expected job growth could drive the market higher because it might reduce the likelihood of the Federal Reserve's raising interest rates. Higher rates would reduce the value of existing securities that pay a fixed rate of return, like Treasury bonds and notes.
The market consensus for September's report also calls for a gain of roughly 150,000 jobs, but individual forecasts ranged from an increase of 50,000 positions to growth of 295,000 jobs.
Economists may be caught off guard by the unpredictable outcome of an annual exodus of college graduates from the work rolls, said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist at First Chicago Capital Markets.
He added that investors might be surprised by another part of the report measuring the change in average hourly wages, considered an indicator of inflation.
The gain in average wages was an unexpectedly strong five-tenths of a percent in August. "Typically, when something like that happens, it tends to reverse itself," Mr. Karydakis said. As a result, average wages in September could be flat or possibly lower, he said.
That could touch off a Treasury market rally by putting to rest fears that inflation will head higher and hurt the value of fixed-income securities.
Short-term Treasury securities yesterday were unchanged to up 1/32 point and intermediate maturities ranged from up 1/32 point to down 1/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, slipped 0.13, to 1,331.16.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 3.02 percent as the discount held at 2.97 percent. Six-month yields were lower at 3.15 percent as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point, to 3.07 percent. One-year yields slipped to 3.31 percent as the discount fell 0.01 point, to 3.20 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 1057/32 , up 1/16 from late Wednesday. The average yield to maturity was 5.43 percent, down from 5.44 percent.

Silver Prices Rise Sharply But Some See Rally Fading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Speculative buying pushed silver prices up sharply for a second straight day yesterday, but the rising values prompted selling by producers, and analysts said the rally could soon end.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for December delivery surged 9.6 cents, to $4.381 an ounce, a four-week high. Gold prices also rose slightly. October gold gained 40 cents, to $356.80 an ounce. 
 Silver futures leaped more than 20 cents an ounce on Wednesday as silver options buying by Middle Eastern investment syndicates brought speculative buying by United States commodity funds.
The Mideast and fund buying continued overnight and yesterday, analysts said.
Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc., said yesterday's jump in silver also reflected expectations that United States employment data scheduled for release today would show an increase of 150,000 to 175,000 nonfarm jobs.
 
Producers Are Selling
 Good economic news is positive for silver because the metal has industrial uses, notably in photographic film manufacturing.
Silver producers have begun to sell at the current high prices, limiting the gains tied to speculative buying, said James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc. in New York.
"It's really becoming a tussle between the two," he said. "I think the rally eventually will be choked off by this producer selling."
Silver supplies are abundant and growing, he said, because of production as a byproduct in the mining of copper and other base metals.
He said the lack of similarly strong gains by the gold and platinum markets "makes me think this silver rally is inherently unstable."
On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for cold, rainy weather in the Midwest and lower Canadian wheat production.
Wheat for December delivery rose 5 1/4 cents, to $3.22 1/2 a bushel. December corn rose 3 1/4 cents, to $2.41 1/2 a bushel. December oats rose 3/4 cent, to $1.37 a bushel, and November soybeans rose 4 cents, to $6.10 1/2 a bushel.
Light sweet crude oil for November delivery rose 7 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $18.49 a barrel. November heating oil rose 0.04 cent, to 55.85 cents a gallon. November unleaded gasoline climbed 0.43 cent, to 51.20 cents a gallon, and November natural gas fell 5.1 cents, to $2.122 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Agnes de Mille, 88, Dance Visionary, Is Dead

BYLINE: By JACK ANDERSON

 BODY:
Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.
The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend. 
 In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet.
 
From Old West to Fall River
 In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.
A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.
She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.
Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.
Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."
But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."
Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.
"The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."
Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.
 
She Felt Destined To Be an Artist
 Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.
Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.
After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.
Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.
Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.
 
Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's
 After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.
She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.
She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.
Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.
 
Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'
 Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.
"Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.
"Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.
Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.
 
Created 'People And Not Automata'
 Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."
Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."
Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.
Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.
Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."
 
Her Final Work Dealt With Death
 In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.
Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.
Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.
Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."
Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.
Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.

HEADLINE: Toni Morrison Is '93 Winner Of Nobel Prize in Literature

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Toni Morrison, the author of "Song of Solomon" "Beloved," "Jazz" and other lyrically narrated novels of black American life, has won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Literature. The announcement was made yesterday in Stockholm by the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy, which stated that Ms. Morrison "gives life to an essential aspect of American reality" in novels "characterized by visionary force and poetic import."
Calling Ms. Morrison "a literary artist of the first rank," the academy statement went on to say: "She delves into the language itself, a language she wants to liberate from the fetters of race. And she addresses us with the luster of poetry." 
 Ms. Morrison, 62, is the 90th winner of the prize, which carries a monetary award of $825,000. She is the eighth woman; the last was Nadine Gordimer in 1991. She is the first black woman to receive the prize. Other Americans who have won the prize in the last two decades are Joseph Brodsky, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Saul Bellow.
In a telephone interview from her office at Princeton, N.J., Ms. Morrison said: "This is a palpable tremor of delight for me. It was wholly unexpected and so satisfying. Regardless of what we all say and truly believe about the irrelevance of prizes and their relationship to the real work, nevertheless this is a signal honor for me."
 
Exploring a Prejudiced Society
 Ms. Morrison, who has taught creative writing at Princeton University since 1989, published her first novel, "The Bluest Eye," in 1970. Set in her Ohio hometown, it describes a black girl's painful coming of age in a white society.
In her five subsequent novels, she established herself as one of America's leading fiction writers, a gifted, popular storyteller whose troubled characters and their struggles expose the fault lines of a society built on racial prejudice. In her most recent novel, "Jazz" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1992), she left behind the small-town world of her previous novels to tell, using a complex, polyphonic technique, a tale of passion and violence set in Harlem in the 1920's.
Her novel "Beloved" (Knopf, 1987), was an enormous commercial success and won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1988.
 
Celebrating 'a Great Day'
 "This is a great day for African-Americans, and for Americans in general," said Henry Louis Gates Jr., the chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard University and the co-editor of a collection of essays on Ms. Morrison's work.
"Just two centuries ago, the African-American literary tradition was born in slave narratives," he said. "Now our greatest writer has won the Nobel Prize."
Ms. Morrison said: "I was thrilled that my mother is still alive and can share this with me. And I can claim representation in so many areas. I'm a Midwesterner, and everyone in Ohio is excited. I'm also a New Yorker, and a New Jerseyan, and an American, plus I'm an African-American, and a woman. I know it seems like I'm spreading like algae when I put it this way, but I'd like to think of the prize being distributed to these regions and nations and races."
Ms. Morrison was born in Lorain, Ohio, a steel town about 25 miles west of Cleveland. She was named Chloe Anthony Wofford.
She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Howard University in Washington in 1953 and a master's degree in English from Cornell University in 1955. At Cornell, she wrote her thesis on the theme of suicide in the works of William Faulkner and Virginia Woolf.
After leaving Cornell, she embarked on an academic career, teaching English at Texas Southern University in Houston and at Howard. While at Howard, she married Harold Morrison, an architect, by whom she has two children, Harold and Slade. The couple divorced in 1964.
In 1965, Ms. Morrison became a textbook editor for a subsidiary of Random House in Syracuse, and two years later she became a trade-book editor at Random House in New York City. She also taught at the State University College at Purchase, N.Y., and at the State University at Albany. In 1987, she was named the Robert F. Goheen Professor in the Humanities Council at Princeton.
 
A Career's Evolution
 In the early 60's, while at Howard, she began writing fiction as part of an informal group of poets and writers who met to discuss their work. She went to one meeting with a short story about a black girl who longed to have blue eyes. The story later evolved into her first novel.
She followed up "The Bluest Eye" with "Sula" (1973), which was nominated for a National Book Award; "Song of Solomon" (1977), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award, and "Tar Baby" (1981).
These works were followed by "Beloved" (1987), the story of a runaway slave who, when captured, cuts her daughter's throat rather than see her grow up in slavery. The book met with enormous popular and critical success.
The novel's failure to win the National Book Award sparked a protest by 48 black writers and critics, who signed a statement published in The New York Times Book Review lamenting the fact that Ms. Morrison had been overlooked for the award and had not yet received a Pulitzer Prize. Shortly afterward, Ms. Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize for "Beloved."
Ms. Morrison has also written many essays and a play. Her most recent work of nonfiction, published last year, is "Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination" (Harvard University Press).
"I think she got the Nobel Prize for two books, essentially, 'Beloved' and 'Jazz,' " Mr. Gates said. " 'Jazz' is truly brilliant post-modern book. Imagine combining Ellington, Faulkner and Maria Callas. That's the voice that emerges.
"She's a masterful craftsperson, which people tend to overlook. She is as great and as innovative as Faulkner and Garcia Marquez and Woolf. That's why she deserved the Nobel Prize."
 
A Surprise Winner
 The announcement that Ms. Morrison had won the Nobel Prize came as something of a surprise. Speculation in the Swedish press had swirled around four possible candidates: Seamus Heaney, the Irish poet, who has been considered a front-runner for several years; Hugo Claus, a Belgian poet, playwright and film maker who writes in Flemish; Bei Dao, an exiled Chinese poet, and Ali Ahmed Saeed, a Syrian-born Lebanese poet who writes under the name Adonis.
American writers whose names have surfaced from time to time are Joyce Carol Oates and Thomas Pynchon.
Ms. Morrison said she had risen about 4:30 A.M. yesterday to write and was startled to hear the phone ring a few hours later. "I knew it was terrible news," she said. "And when a friend of mine on the other end said, 'Did you hear?' then I knew it was something awful. It took a long time for me to accept it."
Some hours later, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy called her to confirm that she had won the prize and told her that a letter would be on its way.
"I said, 'Why don't you send me a fax?' " Ms. Morrison said, laughing. "Somehow, I felt that if I saw a fax, I'd know it wasn't a dream or somebody's hallucination. I'll tell you one thing: we're going to have a big party here tonight."
The Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine, Chemistry and Physics, and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, will be announced in Stockholm next week. The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize next Friday in Oslo.
 
 
Poetry in Prose: A Morrison Sampler
 "The mirror by the door was not a mirror by the door, it was an altar where he stood for only a moment to put on his cap before going out. The red rocking chair was a rocking of his own hips as he sat in the kitchen. Still, there was nothing of his -- his own -- that she could find. It was as if she were afraid she had hallucinated him and needed proof to the contrary. His absence was everywhere, stinging everything, giving the furnishings primary colors, sharp outlines to the corners of rooms and gold light to the dust collecting on table tops. When he was there he pulled everything toward himself. Not only her eyes and all her senses but also inanimate things seemed to exist because of him, backdrops to his presence. Now that he had gone, these things, so long subdued by his presence, were glamorized in his wake."
-- From "Sula" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1973)

 	 	 		. . .	 	"Pretty woman, he thought. Pretty little black-skinned woman. Who wanted to kill for love, die for love. The pride, the conceit of these doormat women amazed him. They were always women who had been spoiled children. Whose whims had been taken seriously by adults and who grew up to be the stingiest, greediest people on earth and out of their stinginess grew their stingy little love that ate everything in sight. They could not believe or accept the fact that they were unloved; they believed that the world itself was off balance when it appeared as though they were not loved. Why did they think they were so lovable? Why did they think their brand of love was better than, or even as good as, anybody else's? But they did. And they loved their love so much they would kill anybody who got in its way." -- From "Song of Solomon" (Knopf, 1977)

 	 	 		. . .	 	The black girls in New York City were crying and their men were looking neither to the right nor to the left. Not because they were heedless, or intent on what was before them, but they did not wish to see the crying, crying girls split into two parts by their tight jeans, screaming at the top of their high, high heels, straining against the pull of their braids and the fluorescent combs holding their hair. Oh, their mouths were heavy with plum lipstick and their eyebrows were a thin gay line, but nothing could stop their crying and nothing could persuade their men to look to the right or look to the left. -- From "Tar Baby" (Knopf, 1981)

 	 	 		. . .	 	When the four horsemen came -- schoolteacher, one nephew, one slave catcher and a sheriff -- the house on Bluestone Road was so quiet they thought they were too late. Three of them dismounted, one stayed in the saddle, his rifle ready, his eyes trained away from the house to the left and to the right, because likely as not the fugitive would make a dash for it. Although sometimes, you could never tell, you'd find them folded up tight somewhere: beneath floorboards, in a pantry -- once in a chimney. Even then care was taken, because the quietest ones, the ones you pulled from a press, a hayloft, or, that once, from a chimney, would go along nicely for two or three seconds. Caught red-handed, so to speak, they would seem to recognize the futility of outsmarting a whiteman and the hopelessness of outrunning a rifle. Smile even, like a child caught dead with his hand in the jelly jar, and when you reached for the rope to tie him, well, even then you couldn't tell. The very nigger with his head hanging and a little jelly-jar smile on his face could all of a sudden roar, like a bull or some such, and commence to do disbelievable things. -- From "Beloved" (Knopf, 1987)

 	 	 		. . .	 	"The right record is on the turntable now; she can hear its preparatory hiss as the needle slides toward its first groove. The brothers smile brilliantly; one leans a fraction of an inch toward the other and, never losing eye contact with Dorcas, whispers something. The other looks Dorcas up and down as she moves toward them. Then, just as the music, slow and smoky, loads up the air, his smile bright as ever, he wrinkles his nose and turns away." -- From "Jazz" (Knopf, 1992)

NBC Goes Bonkers Over Jordan

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
When perspective was required on Michael Jordan Wednesday morning, NBC lit the tilt light. Its Jordan retirement scoop Tuesday night on "Dateline NBC" must have emboldened its news hounds to launch into overkill on the story.
Although I love "The Jerry Springer Show," I can accept NBC truncating it to air the first 30 minutes of Jordan's news conference. NBC is the home of the National Basketball Association and Jordan has brought ratings and money to NBC by dint of his very existence. 
 But dispatching "Nightly News" anchor Tom Brokaw to Deerfield, Ill., as if this were a hardwood Tiananmen Square was excessive. He got no quality time with Jordan and Bob Costas provided all the background that was needed as he sat in a Manhattan studio.
But NBC defended deploying the Rapid Brokaw Force.
"It was the right place to have him," said David Bohrman, NBC News's executive producer for special events. "It was not the most important story in the world, but it was the story of the morning."
 
An Indelicate Balance
 NBC's coverage of the news conference was followed by Brokaw calling upon correspondent Ed Rabel for a report on Somalia. A half-hour for the retirement of a basketball player and just a few minutes for Mogadishu? The families of our slain soldiers must have been happy with NBC's news judgment.
Awkward? "That's the mix of news," said Bohrman, adding that on Monday, NBC broke for 18 minutes into afternoon programming with a Somalia report.
Without a doubt, Jordan's sudden retirement is more than a sports story. He was the greatest player ever. Yet he is merely an athlete whose on-court skills turned him into a modern deity. NBC deployed itself to cover Jordan-
as-god, mobilizing for coverage as if this were Mideast peace.
ABC went overly far to prove it had the most perspective by not covering the news conference live. Maybe ABC didn't want to lose ad revenues by pre-empting "The Home Show." Teri Everett, an ABC News spokesman, said: "We reported it the night before and continued through 'Good Morning America.' We decided it was news we could wait to cover on the evening news."
Bohrman said: "ABC was a bit foolish."
CBS had it about right, pre-empting 15 minutes of "The Price Is Right" for the news conference, a period of time that showed a sense of news and proportion, then returned to Bob Barker. "We cut out when we thought we'd heard enough," said Lane Venardos, vice president of hard news for CBS. "We took several questions, heard enough, and looked for a graceful out."
Venardos scoffed when asked if any thought was given to sending "Evening News" anchor Dan Rather to Deerfield. Connie Chung anchored the coverage.
ESPN2 QUICKIE POST-MORTEM: The creative focus of the week-old ESPN2 is on SportsNight, the Friday-Saturday-Sunday night three-hour studio program. "We have a lot of things to mess around with; we're not sure of the variety and mix of the segments," said John A. Walsh, ESPN's executive editor.
Keith Olbermann, the marquee wiseacre of Sportsnight, has had to tread the line between newsman and funny man but he doesn't have to do it in motorcycle leather and a T-shirt. Just because ESPN2 is designed to be irreverent doesn't mean Olbermann, or anyone else, has to look self-consciously grungy, as if he had dressed out of a hamper. There is style without tuxedos.
 
 
AIRWAVES
 Now that MICHAEL JORDAN is gone, to whom will NBC's AHMAD RASHAD direct his puffball questions? . . . The National Football League held talks this week with ABC, NBC and CBS on the next network TV contract. Said one participant: "The talks with NBC and CBS won't be pretty," because of their heavy losses on the current contract, now in its final year.
NBC yesterday signed a new deal for the broadcast and cable rights to the 1995 and 1997 Ryder Cups for what will surely be more than the estimated $2 million-a-Cup paid for the 1991 and 1993 events. . . . Obscured by the Jordan story and baseball is tomorrow's Miami-Florida State clash at noon on ABC. We're still wondering about this entertainment note from ABC college football analyst BOB GRIESE during last week's Notre Dame-Stanford game: "RAVEN SYMONE. I could watch that young gal all night. She's funny."
The production on CBS's league championship series have been uniformly excellent with terrific angles, excellent close-ups, and a modicum of necessary replays. GREG GUMBEL and JIM KAAT have shown the benefit of verbal economy and SEAN McDONOUGH has stepped up to a high level of excitement. We barely have a nit to pick, except: (a.) TIM McCARVER not noting that Braves third baseman TERRY PENDLETON was too far off the line before KIM BATISTE slammed the game-winning hit past Pendleton Wednesday night to score JOHN KRUK from second base, and (b.) waiting too long Tuesday night to report the story of Jordan's retirement, and JIM GRAY saying Jordan had hurriedly left Comiskey Park when the camera clearly showed him there.

What Happens When The Storyline Retires?

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
The capacity for self-examination among "you guys" in the media is bottomless. But enough about us. Let's talk about Michael Jordan. How did we cover him? Was it as good for you as it was for us?
There are people who will say, c'mon, this is about a 30-year-old multimillionaire taking early retirement. It's not as if the Grateful Dead stopped touring. Do we have to be so serious? 
 Yessss! There is no frame of reference. In this century, there have been only two other American athletes, Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali, who so dominated, advanced and transcended their sports. Both Ruth and Ali hung on past their primes and into pathos. Once they were no longer threatening -- Ruth died, Ali became physically diminished -- they were anointed sports saints.
Rocky Marciano, Bjorn Borg and Jim Brown quit at the top of their games. But the Rock, as revisionists have pointed out, was slightly nuts, and Borg was being run ragged by the new-model tennis player, John McEnroe. Jim Brown, tough, smart, independent, had already spent one year longer in the National Football League than he had planned when we caught up with him on the set of "The Dirty Dozen" in London in 1966. We couldn't believe he wasn't going back to Cleveland, that this wasn't just a bargaining ploy. He was only 29. He was at the top of the world, getting hammered by and showering with the greatest heroes in America's new hottest sport.
Twenty-seven years later, it's still hard for some of "you guys" to believe that a guy at the top of the world, getting hammered by and showering with the greatest heroes in America's new hottest sport, would just bail. Rationality would argue that the new era of big, fast money, intense scrutiny and greater post-season opportunities would make early bailing a seductive option; what's surprising is that there isn't more of it, that it's still easier to cover Sugar Ray Leonard risking blindness than Timm Rosenbach leaving pro football at 26.
Bailing early, giving up the spotlight is an affront to our hand-held mikes, to what we're selling, as well as a repudiation of our own election by reflection. Some of the nastiest of "you guys" will sweat and grovel for access, for autographs, for snapshots of their kids posing with the Michael Jordans. And what about the fawning laughter that rose from "you guys" whenever Jordan mentioned them during his masterful retirement press conference, including after the promise to advise other players "not to talk to you."
Jordan is special only in degree, which of course is special enough, but, as he pointed out, there will always be "another player." Jordan knows that "you guys" will go away if he does. Have you been hearing a lot about Magic lately, seen a lot of his commercials, been reading what he thinks about Somalia, health care, Dinkins?
So what will we do now?
Reconfigure the arc of the story. There are three main directions for coverage in the near future, unless the climaxes of the baseball season or some juicier outrage get our attention. One is Michael the humanist, two is Mr. Jordan the new role model, and three is the Comeback Conspiracy.
In one, coverage will point out that Michael Jordan has already shown the public more humanity in retirement than in 12 years of college, pro and endorsement basketball. Quotes from psychologists will help. The grieving process for Michael's late father, murdered while napping in his car after midnight in a secluded spot, brought Michael back to that age of innocence before the selfishness of career obscured the importance of family and friends. "Michael Jordan was once a basketball player . . . now he's a human being," declared Jordan. He has come to realize, perhaps with our tough love, that a life in the air, in hotel suites, limos, fortress mansions, can never be as sweet and rewarding as a true and scrabbling life among the groundlings.
In two, "you guys" will chronicle Mr. Jordan's climb to above the rim of the corporations that so far have merely paid him to be a role model for consumers, peddling various perishables of dubious necessity. Now, Mr. Jordan will offer an example to youth of a business star as he markets healthful products and encourages communities, particularly black communities, to use their economic leverage to create more jobs and business opportunities for their youngsters.
In three, the quote "I'm not making this a never issue" will be spun into THE GREATEST COMEBACK IN THE HISTORY OF ENTERTAINMENT. High-minded "you guys" see a scenario in which both Michael the Humanist, having healed and bonded, and Mr. Jordan the New Role Model, having adopted several poor neighborhoods, will notice that the Chicago Bulls are foundering at midseason. His other "family" needs him! Into his old suit! Something new to achieve! Four-ward! (Gutter "you guys" will resurrect old gambling stories and try to link the Bulls' turnaround with a betting coup.)
And then, get this! As part of his comeback contract, Michael Jordan will ban all media coverage of the National Basketball Association final so the game may again flower in innocence and fun.
Serve "you guys" right.

'She Loves Me' Bounces to Broadway

 BODY:
"She Loves Me," initially presented by the Roundabout Theater Company, has reopened at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, Manhattan. Following are excerpts from Frank Rich's review, which appeared in The New York Times on June 11. Diane Fratantoni has succeeded Judy Kuhn in the role of Amalia Balash.
The first time I ever walked out of a Broadway show was to see "She Loves Me" a second time. It was Christmas week of 1963, and "She Loves Me," a sensitive flower among hard-edged comic blockbusters like "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," was surely a goner with the New Year. It was now or never. I bolted out of the 2 o'clock matinee of another flop (remember "Jennie," anyone?) to take one last look at "She Loves Me" at 3. 
 Though I didn't know much about anything else in 1963, time has borne out my youthful infatuation with "She Loves Me," which has finally received the exquisite revival of its fans' dreams. An intimate work with nothing on its sophisticated mind other than romance, "She Loves Me" is no less an anomaly on Broadway today than it was 30 years ago. Given how the world has aged since then, audiences may be hungrier than ever for this summons to a continuously melodic evening of sheer enchantment and complete escape.
That escape is to a civilization that doesn't exist anymore, the Mitteleuropa of the mid-1930's. Based on the same Hungarian play that inspired Ernst Lubitsch's Hollywood comedy "The Shop Around the Corner," the musical is about the lovelorn clerks in a Budapest parfumerie. Georg Nowack and Amalia Balash, perpetually bickering colleagues by day, are also unwitting, passionate pen pals by night, brought together pseudonymously by a lonely hearts' classified. Inevitably, Georg and Amalia must realize the truth about each other and their own feelings, but not before there are a few farcical mix-ups, sad misunderstandings and hard-won journeys to self-knowledge.
Though Joe Masteroff's economic, Schnitzler-flavored book for the musical is a model of construction and taste, it is the exceptional score by Jerry Bock (music) and Sheldon Harnick (lyrics) that most makes the piece endure. Even this team's classic songs for "Fiorello!" and "Fiddler on the Roof" lack the consistency of tone of "She Loves Me," which has almost as much music as an operetta, all of it written in a lilting style that respects the story's milieu (and occasionally its waltz-time). The score boasts no Broadway brass, no out-of-character numbers intended for the hit parade. And Mr. Harnick's frequently funny lyrics are as intelligent and adult as the characters, who read Flaubert, listen to Chopin and know far more than most musical-comedy lovers of their day about sex.
The main, though far from only, reason for the success of this revival is that the director, Scott Ellis, has assembled a company that can act as well as sing and is gifted and idiosyncratic enough to ward off any saccharine cliches. Boyd Gaines, a fine character actor best known as the rueful gay doctor in "The Heidi Chronicles," is a revelation as Georg: a handsome, light-footed leading man with a strong voice and a sweet, rectitudinously earnest air reminscent of Jimmy Stewart. A half-dozen supporting players, led by Sally Mayes's proto feminist Ilona and Howard McGillin as her smarmy suitor, are given show stoppers, too. The evening's one elaborate production number, a wrong-step fandango for illicit lovers titled "A Romantic Atmosphere," is ignited by Rob Marshall's impressively dizzy choreography.
"She Loves Me" demands a refined romantic atmosphere to embrace these performances, and Mr. Ellis delivers it, re-creating (sometimes literally so) the bittersweet delicacy of Harold Prince's original staging. The production design -- by Tony Walton (sets), Peter Kaczorowski (lighting) and David Charles and Jane Greenwood (costumes) -- is a throwback to a 1930's M-G-M notion of the cosmopolitan, bathed in a wintry violet glow that suggests both an Eastern European twilight and the twilight of an era.
As much as the evening evokes the past, however, it does not leave the melancholy aftertaste of nostalgia. "She Loves Me" is far less dated than many of the more successful musicals of its vintage because its unsentimental romantic emotions never age. As Georg and Amalia gradually overcome their cynicism and melt with affection, we melt, too, in defiance of our own cynical 1993 instincts. "She Loves Me" turns out to be one love affair that, against Broadway's odds, has grown only deeper with time.

HEADLINE: New York Poll Sees Grim View Of Life in City

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
A majority of New Yorkers say the quality of life in the city has declined over the last four years, and they generally have a bleak view of the state of the local economy, race relations, crime and the public schools, according to the latest New York Times/ WCBS-TV News Poll.
But in the midst of an election campaign in which Rudolph W. Giuliani has made the quality of life a major issue, the poll also found that most New Yorkers do not think either he or Mayor David N. Dinkins is likely to change things significantly. 
 In the survey of 1,223 adults, conducted between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, 62 percent said life in the city had got worse over the last four years, while only 9 percent of those surveyed said it had improved. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Sixty-five percent of the respondents said they viewed the state of the local economy as bad or very bad; 59 percent said they found the city less safe than they did four years ago; 67 percent described race relations as poor, and 70 percent said they were not satisfied with the quality of the public schools. Black New Yorkers were somewhat more optimistic than white or Hispanic respondents on virtually every measure, the poll found.
Those findings would seem to work against Mr. Dinkins, the Democratic incumbent, and in favor of Mr. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, who has tried to present himself as an agent for change, framing the contest as between himself as a bold innovator and the Mayor as a fatigued defender of the status quo. But the poll indicates strongly that whatever dissatisfactions that New Yorkers have about the state of the city, they have low expectations of either candidate's ability to turn things around.
"The city has gone down," said Nan Babiak, 27, who works in television production and lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "I've noticed a lot more crime on the street. If it could get any dirtier, it looks like it has."
Ms. Babiak said she did not think Mr. Dinkins or Mr. Giuliani was likely to improve significantly the state of the city. She said no mayor by himself could reduce crime or expand the economy; at best, she said, a mayor can be a kind of municipal cheerleader. "It's a bigger job than anyone can handle," she said. "It's more of a moral support kind of thing."
 
Race Relations
 When registered voters were asked in the survey how they thought race relations might change if Mr. Dinkins were re-elected, 55 percent said they thought they would remain the same. Eighteen percent said race relations would get worse and 22 percent said they would get better in a second Dinkins administration.
Forty-four percent of those surveyed said race relations would remain the same if Mr. Giuliani became mayor, while 18 percent said they would improve and 25 percent said they would get worse.
Similarly, 45 percent of the voters said the economy would remain the same if Mr. Dinkins were re-elected, and 41 percent said the election of Mr. Giuliani would not change the state of the local economy. A slightly higher number of people said the economy would improve if Mr. Giuliani became mayor, with 28 percent saying it would improve under the Republican-Liberal, and 21 percent saying it would get better under Mr. Dinkins.
 
Distinct Edge on Crime
 Mr. Giuliani did have a distinct edge when it came to voters' perceptions on crime. Sixty-eight percent of the voters surveyed said Mr. Giuliani was tough enough to deal with crime in New York, while only 40 percent thought the Mayor was tough enough.
Black voters, who support Mr. Dinkins overwhelmingly, tended to be more upbeat about conditions in the city and the Mayor's ability to improve things. For example, 24 percent of black voters surveyed said New York was safer now than it was four years, while 5 percent of white voters said it was safer. And though 18 percent of black voters said life in the city had improved over the last four years, only 5 percent of white voters said life had got better.
It may not be surprising after nearly five years of a deep recession that the poll found New Yorkers' overall outlook to be grim. But the survey also showed some striking ambivalence on significant civic questions.
While the respondents were very dissatisfied with the general quality of the public schools -- 70 percent said they were not satisfied and 16 percent said they were -- New Yorkers were less unhappy about their own local schools. Forty-seven percent said they were dissatisfied with the public schools in their neighborhood, with 35 percent saying they were satisfied with the local schools.
Forty-nine percent of those who said they had a child in a public school said they were satisfied with their local schools, while 46 percent in this category were dissatisfied.
 
A Familiar Pattern
 Pollsters say the pattern is a familiar one in surveys, in which people's dissatisfactions diminish as they are questioned about matters increasingly close to home. The most common version of the phenomenon involves respondents who say they have broad discontent with Congress but are relatively content with their own Congressional representative.
New Yorkers also showed a marked ambivalence about the homeless in The Times/WCBS-TV News Poll. Sixty-three percent of the voters surveyed said the city should get tougher with homeless people who make a nuisance of themselves; 55 percent said the city should get tougher in a similar survey four years ago.
But when asked about a proposal by Mr. Giuliani to restrict most homeless people to a maximum of 90 days in the city's shelters, only 25 percent of the respondents said it was a good idea. Sixty percent said it would create more problems.
The poll also showed some intriguing patterns on other public issues. Asked, for example, whom they blamed for the asbestos problems that delayed the opening of school last month, 67 percent of those surveyed blamed the Board of Education alone, while only 6 percent blamed Mr. Dinkins and 7 percent blamed former Mayor Edward I. Koch.
 
Support for Chancellor
 The new Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, won strong support after his first month in the job: 39 percent said they approved of his performance, and 13 percent disapproved.
But there appeared to be deep concerns about the Board of Education. A majority of those questioned, 52 percent, said the mayor should be able to appoint more members to the central board, a change that Mr. Dinkins has been advocating. Yet a larger majority, 68 percent, favored the elimination of the central board and the creation of five separate borough boards, something that Mr. Giuliani, among others, has proposed.
A possible explanation for these seemingly contradictory findings is that New Yorkers are sufficiently frustrated over the Board of Education that they are inclined to favor any change in its structure.
 
Ready to Leave
 In its most provocative finding, the survey determined that 45 percent of respondents said things had got so bad in New York that they would move out tomorrow if they could. Some pollsters played down the significance of the finding, noting that similar surveys in Chicago and London also showed many residents said they wanted to leave immediately.
"I wish I had the money to get out of the city," said Joanne Walter, 34, who lives in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, and has three children. "There are people going through the garbage. There was a hooker on my corner the other morning. They broke into my car several times. My mother was mugged. It's rough."
But Alan Deberry, 44, who lives in Williamsbridge in the Bronx, said he had no desire to leave. "I'm not giving up on the city because I was born here, raised here and went to school here," he said. "It seems like the city is getting a little better. The Mayor is trying his best to make the city a little safer."

HEADLINE: New York Hospitals Foresee Loss Of Billions Under Clinton's Plan

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
Already facing chronic money problems, New York City's hospitals said yesterday that they would lose about $4 billion in Government revenue, or about 4 percent of the hospitals' total budgets, in the first five years of President Clinton's proposed national health plan.
In perhaps the first detailed look at how the Clinton proposal could affect local health care providers, the Greater New York Hospital Association said that cuts in Medicare and Medicaid would far outweigh increases in aid for people who now lack health insurance.
 
Cuomo Meets With Moynihan
 The hospital association's report is a first step in what promises to be intense jockeying among interest groups in the health care industry that hope to reshape the Administration's plan to guarantee health care to all Americans. In New York City, for example, although hospitals stand to lose revenue, some clinics, doctors and other health care providers may receive more money. 
 White House officials say they are taking steps to lessen the burden on urban hospitals as they translate their draft plan into legislative proposals.
For his part, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo met yesterday with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and one of the lawmakers who will help determine the ultimate face of the health care plan. State officials said the Governor, who has expressed specific concerns about how the health care overhaul would affect New York's finances, told Mr. Moynihan about changes he would like to see in the plan, including increases in matching funds from the Federal Government to help the state pay its share of Medicaid.
The hospital report is the work of an association that includes the 64 nonprofit and municipal hospitals that provide the overwhelming share of hospital care in New York City.
"If the plan were financed as currently proposed, the hospitals in New York City would experience net revenue reductions of such magnitude that many would not be able to sustain their current level of operations," the report says. "Hospitals most at risk would be those that serve high concentrations of patients whose health insurance coverage is publicly financed through the Medicare and Medicaid programs."
The hospital group said it strongly supported the goals of the health plan, which ultimately should help relieve hospitals of one of their most pressing problems: caring for people who lack either company-sponsored health insurance or Government protection for health care costs.
But the detailed figures in the report suggest that, at least in New York and possibly in other large cities, sharp cuts in reimbursements for Medicare coverage for the elderly and Medicaid coverage for the poor are likely to exceed the increased money from a variety of sources for providing health care to those who are now uninsured. The national health care overhaul could prove particularly difficult for the city's web of hospitals and clinics, the nation's largest public health system.
The problem for New York City involves several factors: New York is more generous in its health care support for low-income people than other cities and it has a larger proportion of people on Medicaid. At the same time, it has a smaller proportion who are uninsured, so it would gain less than other cities from the Clinton plan's support for such people.
"New York's municipal hospitals already face chronic deficits," said Karen Parker, vice president for health economics at the association. "This could develop into a very, very dangerous situation."
 
Changes to Be Made
 At the White House, Richard Kronick, a senior health policy adviser, said the hospital study, which he pointed out was based on preliminary figures, failed to take into account changes to be made in the initial Medicare proposals that should soften the impact on New York City hospitals. Moreover, he said, the study assumes that of the approximately $800 million a year in Medicaid spending cuts, about $300 million of the cuts would be made by state and city governments. Those governments might choose to preserve that aid, even as the Federal share drops.
He also said that some of the money that hospitals expect to lose would flow to doctors and clinics outside the hospital system. "It is important to remember that we are still talking about net increases to the New York health care industry, even if there will be some redistribution to nonhospital providers."
Mr. Kronick said that hospitals should also be able to save money through greater efficiencies in the Clinton plan, like standardized insurance forms. "There's no intention that needed hospital services will be forced to close," he said.
 
Compensating Aspects
 Some local hospital officials expressed reservations about the study. Dr. Benjamin Chu, a senior vice president at the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, said the report highlighted the "grave revenue implications" for local hospitals of the initial Clinton proposal, but said that he expected certain other aspects of the plan to help compensate for the losses. He mentioned the Administration's promise, which has yet to be spelled out in detail, to provide extra money to cities and states that must provide health care to large numbers of undocumented immigrants.
The study acknowledged that the full impact of the health care proposal is hard to determine, because many of the details have yet to be worked out.
According to the study, which was done in conjunction with a health care consulting company, Network Inc., city hospitals could lose as much as $12 billion from 1996 through 2000 because of Medicare and Medicaid reductions. That sum represents more than 12 percent of the total revenues of New York's hospitals.
In return, city hospitals could expect to receive $8 billion in new revenues as a result of the expansion of health care coverage to those who are now uninsured. The shortfall would be almost $4 billion, or roughly 4 percent of the hospitals' expected total spending of about $100 billion over the five years.
The report projects that over five years, the city's hospitals could gain $7.98 billion to provide coverage for the uninsured. But they would lose $4 billion given to hospitals that serve a high proportion of low-income, Medicaid patients. Changes to reduce the rise in Medicare would cut an additional $7.34 billion, and $588 million would be lost in Federal money for hospitals that train new doctors.

HEADLINE: Pessimism in Haiti: Violence Could Swamp Diplomacy

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Just three weeks before Haiti's exiled President is to be restored to power, many Haitians are expressing doubts about whether a peaceful return to democracy is possible in the climate of growing violence here.
One reason for the fear is a lack of faith in the foreign force that is envisioned as the glue to hold together this country's negotiated political settlement. The 1,300-member contingent of troops and policemen coming in will carry nothing more powerful than handguns and will not be authorized to stop violence. A warship carrying about 250 American soldiers left a naval base in Puerto Rico today and another ship with 300 more troops was preparing to depart, the Pentagon said. 
 The rising pessimism also has been fanned by reports of deep ambivalence toward the mission among United States defense officials in the wake of a rising death toll among American soldiers in Somalia.
 
No Somalia, Diplomats Say
 But diplomats in Haiti say the country in no way resembles Somalia.
The 7,000-man Haitian Army, for all of its unruliness, remains a ragtag, poorly equipped force that has shown no inclination for direct confrontation with anything more challenging than the unarmed civilians who are routinely found dead here.
Critics of the current diplomatic strategy say they fear that the army, emboldened by assurances against foreign intervention, will make the country ungovernable. Some of those critics, including dissenting diplomats, say such a campaign is already under way.
Two of the most prominent supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the popularly elected Catholic priest who was ousted two years ago in a military coup, have narrowly escaped assassination by plainclothes gunmen. On Thursday, the capital and much of the countryside were shut down in a strike enforced at gunpoint. And today, more than 500 boisterous opponents of Father Aristide's return marched past army headquarters and shouted to waving senior officers that they must not step down, as called for in the diplomatic settlement.
 
Nature of Haitian Situation
 "The fatal flaw is a lack of understanding of the Haitian mentality or of the Haitian situation," said a businessman with close ties to diplomats. The man, who has grown increasingly doubtful of the chances that diplomacy will succeed, added, "What this settlement is asking for is that people who have been accustomed to a certain way of living for over 30 years give up their control of the country voluntarily."
Even as doubts like these emerge, diplomats involved in Haiti's political crisis insist that everything is working well, and point to their own achievements.
In the three months of diplomacy since an accord was signed in New York calling for the restoration of President Aristide, a constitutional Government has been seated and a crushing economic embargo has been lifted. Foreign economic aid has begun to flow into the country.
The army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, renewed a pledge to resign by Oct. 15 in a meeting on Thursday with Robert Malval, the Prime Minister chosen by Father Aristide, said diplomats who took part in talks.
But Haitian analysts and diplomats with long experience in the country say there are danger signals. For one, these observers say, the organizers of the recent anti-Aristide demonstrations are closely tied to the army high command, in particular with General Cedras's most trusted aide, Gen. Philippe Biamby, the chief of staff.
 
Protest Leader Linked to Army
 A leader of the demonstrations, Emmanuel Constant, spent much of the first six months after the coup against Father Aristide working out of General Biamby's office, say businessmen who know both men.
Furthermore, diplomats say many of the demonstrators are known to be off-duty policemen and attaches, the plainclothes police auxiliaries who have committed most of the recent violence, often operating under the open protection of uniformed police.
Diplomats who are leading political discussions here say that much of Haiti's planned settlement was inspired by the experience of deeply torn nations in Central America, where extremists of the right and left were gradually brought toward a democratic middle. But in Haiti, even these architects admit that there has been little real movement toward reconciliation from either side. Father Aristide, a leftist, has failed to name a broad-based Government, and the army has skillfully used violence and procedural roadblocks to prevent a buildup of momentum in support of the settlement plan.
Moreover, critics of the approach say, the Haitian military lives comfortably on the spoils of graft and smuggling and is not as sensitive to issues of military aid and professional respect as its Central American counterparts.
Haitian analysts say there is little that can be done under the settlement to force the military to relinquish power as planned.
"There has been an obsession in the United States in bending over backwards to accommodate Haitian concerns over intervention," said a former Haitian official with close ties to American diplomats. "If putting an embargo back in place is all they can come up with, the army is prepared to live with it. They made money on the embargo last time."

 "But there are many ideas about what should happen to Hanoi," he said as he nervously fingered the architectural designs for a 20-story building that could change the look of the capital forever. "Some people say that it is not necessary to preserve the old city of Hanoi because it is a symbol of poverty. Some people question whether we would let them starve so that a few of us can admire the beautiful old buildings."
This tranquil capital of tree-shaded streets and ocher, colonial-era villas set among tiny lakes is under threat from an economic revolution that has the potential of transforming Vietnam from a Communist backwater to one of the economic tigers of Southeast Asia.
The increasingly lonely vigil to save old Hanoi is being led by a handful of Vietnamese officials and foreign friends of the city who want to prevent its gracious if crumbling beauty from being sacrificed in Vietnam's headlong rush to free markets and economic development.
The preservation debate has begun in earnest with the announcement that a Singapore-based development company is planning to erect the city's first tall building, a 20-story tower of luxury apartments, the heart of a $41-million residential and office complex directly across from the Hoan Kiem Lake. Many of Hanoi's three million people consider the lake to be the center of their city.
Also bound for "redevelopment" in Hanoi is the site of the colonial-era prison that became known to a generation of Americans as the Hanoi Hilton, because it was there that American prisoners of war were held during the Vietnam War. Those plans are not so far advanced, but there are reports that the prison will be torn down and replaced with a $33-million, five-star hotel.
 
Where Rivers Join
 Hanoi was founded in the 11th century by the Vietnamese King Ly Thai To, who wanted to inaugurate his dynasty by creating a beautiful new capital along the confluence of the Red River and the To Lich River. It has been preserved not because of the work of enlightened urban planners, but because of generations of civil war and economic stagnation in Vietnam.
During the Vietnam War, Hanoi, unlike much of the rest of North Vietnam, was mostly spared the devastation of American bombers. Neighborhoods are little changed in appearance from the era of the great Vietnamese kings or the French colonialists who deposed them.
Vietnam's era of economic stagnation appears to be over, however. With the collapse of its former patron, the Soviet Union, Vietnam has abandoned Marxist economic theory and has embraced the free market. Foreign real estate developers have rushed into Vietnam.
From the beginning, there was less to preserve in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly the southern capital of Saigon, which during the Vietnam War developed a skyline of tall, modern, mostly characterless buildings.
In Hanoi, however, there is little of modern architecture and no very tall buildings -- the city's tallest structure is a six-story office complex that until recently was the only building in the city with an elevator.
Foreign developers say that with land prices exploding in the capital, they are without a cost-effective means of preserving much of the old architecture of Hanoi.
"It's called progress," said Peter Purcell, the Australian developer who is behind Hanoi Plaza, the complex that will include the 20-story building.
"If Hanoi is going to achieve anything like the importance it seeks as a government and financial center, you will have to have modern buildings," he said. "And the economics of modern buildings hold that if the land is of a certain value, the buildings have to be a certain size. To make omelets in this city, you will have to break some eggs."
For Hanoi Plaza, the cost of progress will include the demolition of a city landmark, a cavernous, cream-colored two-story department store built by the French in the late 1920's.
 
A Practical Matter
 "We've been right through the department store and it was quite clear to us that it was impractical to save any of it," said Mr. Purcell.
While his project has already received the approval of the Government's foreign investment department, other agencies have not yet signed off including Mr. Lan's office.
"On a case-by-case basis," he said, the city will probably have to approve the construction of a number of high-rise buildings or risk the loss of the foreign investment needed to create a prosperous city.
"All of the foreign investors want to put their money into projects right in the center of the city, and they only want to build tall buildings," he said. "If we reject them, then maybe the investors will go to Beijing or Seoul or Bangkok. That is not what we want."

HEADLINE: Salinas Asks Trade Pact Effort

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 8

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appealed to a group of visiting American Congressmen today to approve the North American Free Trade Agreement without modification or delay, suggesting that Mexico might not support the pact if it is not put into effect by Jan. 1.
In a meeting with the Congressional delegation at the presidential residence, Los Pinos, Mr. Salinas reaffirmed a written statement he made to The Washington Post on Thursday that neither renegotiating nor rescheduling the agreement "are real options at this stage." 
 But Mr. Salinas and other Mexican officials stopped well short of saying directly that they would reject the agreement if it were not voted on in the United States until early next year. The possibility of such a delay has been raised in recent weeks by Clinton Administration officials and leaders on Capitol Hill.
The hard tone of Mr. Salinas's remarks smacked of political maneuvering because it contrasts notably with other statements he has made.
He has previously insisted that some form of trade agreement between Mexico, the United States and Canada is "inevitable." A short-term delay in the agreement's passage in Washington, he has also predicted, will probably not have pernicious consequences either for the Mexican economy or for his party's chances in the presidential elections scheduled for August 1994.
Mexican political analysts and foreign diplomats said they considered it extremely unlikely, if not unthinkable, that Mr. Salinas would walk away from the accord if a United States Congressional vote were postponed until early next year. The accord has already been ratified in Canada, and its approval in Mexico is a foregone conclusion.

HEADLINE: New York's Lucrative Offer Persuades Unicef to Stay

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Unicef, the United Nations relief organization that had considered moving to New Rochelle, said yesterday it would remain in its current headquarters across from the United Nations and expand into 14 floors of a nearby Manhattan office tower.
The agency, which had been negotiating with the two cities for three years and had even considered moving to Germany, said it would accept a lucrative package of financial incentives offered by the Dinkins administration. 
 In effect, the city agreed to hand over ownership of Unicef headquarters to the agency at the end of a 30-year lease. The agreement all but assures that Unicef will remain in Manhattan for at least three decades and is a major symbolic victory for the city, which has battled to keep major corporations from leaving Manhattan.
 
Praise for New Rochelle
 But in announcing its decision at a news conference attended by Mr. Dinkins, Unicef officials praised the efforts of New Rochelle, which has prepared a plan for major redevelopment of its downtown business district and had worked hard to lure the agency as an anchor tenant.
"Little New Rochelle has to be a remarkable community to have stimulated New York City to offer this massive response," said James P. Grant, the agency's executive director. He added that Unicef had always considered the East Side of Manhattan to be the best location for its headquarters because of its proximity to the United Nations.
The agency has 900 employees at its headquarters in 3 United Nations Plaza, an office tower built for it by New York City in 1987. It was considering moving because more space was needed.
 
Identity Crisis Avoided
 In announcing that it would occupy 14 floors at 633 Third Avenue, just off 41st Street Unicef said it planned to expand its Manhattan staff by 600 people over the next 20 years.
Mayor Dinkins said New York City had more at risk than 1,500 jobs when the agency threatened to leave.
"Unicef is important to New York's identity as an international city," said the Mayor, who had lobbied hard to persuade the agency not to leave.
In the end, Unicef officials said the financial inducements offered by City Hall persuaded it to stay.
Unicef's headquarters is part of a complex that was financed and built by the United Nations Development Corporation, an agency created by the city and state. The agency raised money in the 1980's through the sale of tax-free municipal bonds
Until now, Unicef, like the other United Nations tenants, has simply been a tenant But under terms of the deal announced yesterday, it will receive a new 30-year lease at reduced rent, with the rent being used, in essence, as mortgage payments
Carl Weisbrod, one of Mayor Dinkins's chief economic advisers, said yesterday that Unicef will pay $1.7 million less annually when the term of its new lease begins. The new lease, has provision To persuade Unicef to expand into 633 Third Avenue, he said, the United Nations Development Agency will again raise money through the sale of public bonds and buy 14 floors of the building, which are being sold as condominium space. Although the deal has not been completed, officials said the agency will pay about $26 million for the space, or about $100 per square foot.
Unicef is then to lease the space for 30 years under the same terms asat its headquarters. By 2026, it is to own both properties.

The Economy
The unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent in September, with the labor market improving only modestly by adding 156,000 payroll jobs. Although the results matched expectations, some secondary numbers reflected more weakness than had been expected. The report sent the dollar down against European currencies and ignited a powerful rally in the bond market. [Page 39.]
Suspicion that some traders made big profits in Treasury bond futures using an unauthorized leak of the September employment data has prompted an investigation by the Chicago Board of Trade and the Labor Department. [51.] 
 The mood was oddly buoyant when 100,000 farmers gathered in Iowa for the annual Farm Progress Show, even though many Midwestern fields are still under water from the summer's flooding and many crops were planted late. [39.]
 
Companies
QVC Network is negotiating with BellSouth and at least two other companies in search of financing to raise its $9.5 billion bid for Paramount Communications and avoid having to turn for help to John C. Malone, one of its partners in the offer. [39.]
Martin Marietta is said to be negotiating to buy the space division of General Dynamics. A formal agreement could be announced as early as next week, aerospace executives say. [41.]
Delta Air Lines is under Justice Department investigation over concern its agreements with travel agents in Salt Lake City might harm a smaller competitor, Morris Air. [41.]
Western Waste shares plunged 38 percent after the company announced the collapse of a merger with Browning-Ferris. [41.]
Volkswagen is struggling to correct problems at SEAT, its Spanish subsidiary, which had a $769 million fiscal 1993 loss. [41.]
Amdahl expects a third-quarter operating loss, its third in a row, as the mainframe business continues to deteriorate. [41.]
Dell Computer is recalling about 17,000 discontinued notebook computers because of a possible fire hazard. [47.]
 
International
A dinner for the First Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam in Manhattan attracted dozens of senior executives from American industry, eager to do business with a former enemy that, sooner or later, will be freed from an 18-year-old economic embargo. [39.]
The U.S. is planning to raise $2.1 billion to offset lost revenue caused by the North American Free Trade Agreement primarily by raising customs and other fees for foreign tourists. [10.]
 
Markets
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond plunged to 5.92 percent as the bond market interpreted the September employment report as hard evidence of a weak American economy. [48.]
Stocks were mixed despite a strong performance by the bond market. The Dow industrials gained 1.11 point, to 3,584.74. [40.]
The dollar fell against European currencies after the employment report indicated interest rates would not be raised. [50.]
Lumber prices rose on an agreement with environmental groups that opened less land for logging than expected. [50.]
 
Your Money
Stocks in small companies look promising for investors with a long view and the stomach for sharp downturns. Lately, these issues have produced handsome rewards. [37.]
Small investors can partake in computerized trading through computer data services including Compuserve and Prodigy. [37.]
Term life insurance may become too costly for some people as they grow older, and its usefulness should be reconsidered. [37.]
Most American investors interested in the public offering of Banque Nationale de Paris must turn to mutual funds. [38.]

HEADLINE: Traveler Fees May Rise To Pay for Trade Accord

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is planning to raise $500 million a year to help pay for the North American Free Trade Agreement, primarily by raising fees on travelers entering the United States, Congressional officials say.
Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, said at a news conference here this morning that Administration officials were in the final stages of drafting the plan with members of Congress, and would announce the plan in a few days. 
 By gradually eliminating tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, the free-trade agreement would reduce Federal revenue by at least $2.4 billion over the next five years. A provision of the 1990 budget agreement effectively requires that this revenue loss be offset with higher taxes or cuts in mandatory spending programs like Medicare, creating a thorny problem for an Administration that barely persuaded Congress this summer to raise taxes and lower spending to reduce the budget deficit.
Five Congressional participants in drafting the plan said this week that the most likely plan would be a sharp increase in customs, immigration and agricultural inspection fees now charged on airline and ship passengers arriving from countries outside North America.
 
Airline Ticket Price
 The $5 customs fee, $5 immigration fee and $1.45 agricultural fee are included in the price of round-trip international airline tickets, and are now used to pay for the Government's costs in handling incoming passengers.
One of the five participants said on Monday that the fees would be doubled and the customs fee would apply for the first time to travelers flying to the United States from Canada and Mexico, while the agricultural fee would apply for the first time to travelers flying here from Canada. Other participants said today, however, that the increases would be large but would not amount to a doubling of the fees.
The Administration has also been looking at the imposition of border crossing fees on trains, trucks and individuals, participants said.
Administration officials notified the Mexican Government on Thursday that the White House was considering an increase in the airline fees. There has been no response from Mexico City yet, said a Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Mexican Government was not notified of any plans to impose border crossing fees, the official added.
In an interview after his news conference, Mr. Kantor said that no final decision had been made but that higher customs fees were under consideration. "There are a number of alternatives," he said. "That's only one of them; we've looked at 15 or 20."
The Congressional participants also said that no decision had been made, but that the alternatives were less politically palatable and unlikely to happen. "If you have to reach into an entitlement, you've got Medicare, disability, Social Security," which are all popular programs, one participant said.
The nation's airline industry is beginning to lobby against the plan, and is considering whether to oppose the entire agreement if the Administration goes through with it. "The industry has been suffering from a tremendous burden of taxes and user fees," said Edward A. Merlis, the senior vice president for external affairs of the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group in Washington that has taken no position on the pact so far.
Mr. Merlis said the Administration could raise $645 million a year just from airline tickets if it doubles the fees and eliminates the exemptions. Mr. Kantor said the free-trade agreement would cost the Federal Government about $500 million a year.
The Administration plan must generate money not only for the lost tariffs but also for the $225 million that the White House has pledged for the creation of a border cleanup fund with Mexico. The Administration has also been trying to decide whether to include money in the trade pact legislation for extra customs officials along the Mexican border and to help American workers who lose their jobs because of Mexican competition.
 
Punitive Tariffs Law
 Mr. Kantor also indicated today that the Administration might include a trade law known as Super 301 into legislation putting the free-trade agreement into law. The law requires the Trade Representative to impose punitive tariffs or other trade sanctions quickly on any country that persistently restricts American exports.
An aide to Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on International Trade, said the Senator was trying to persuade the Administration to add such a provision, and had been warmly received. But another Congressional aide said the Administration would risk antagonizing Republicans if it adds Super 301, while most Democratic advocates of Super 301 are opposed to the free-trade pact and unlikely to be swayed by its inclusion.
In effect from 1988 to 1990, Super 301 was an amendment to Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. The law was intended by Congressional Democrats to be a weapon against what they perceived as Japanese trade barriers.
Seiichiro Noboru, the economics minister at the Japanese Embassy, said the free-trade agreement was a trade-expanding measure that should not be linked to Super 301, which he criticized as a law that could be exploited by American protectionists.
Congressional rules for the approval of free-trade agreements call for the legislation to include "necessary or appropriate" language to put the agreements' provisions into law. In the past, this has been interpreted to allow changes in trade laws not mentioned in the agreement. But the legislation cannot include unrelated measures like money for bridges and highways in the districts of influential members of Congress.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua's Feuding Parties Strike Deal to End a Standoff

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Nicaragua's feuding political parties have struck a deal aimed at resolving the country's political crisis.
The leftist Sandinistas and the conservative National Opposition Union said late Thursday that they had agreed to remove President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's economic Cabinet members and paved the way for the departure of Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, the head of the armed forces. His departure would be part of a military reorganization bill under review by Mrs. Chamorro's staff. 
 Nicaragua was plunged into a crisis in August when contra rebels kidnapped 39 legislators, soldiers and Government officials, triggering a retaliatory seizure of conservatives, including Vice President Virgilio Godoy, by pro-Sandinista commandos.
No one was injured in the weeklong standoff, but the kidnappings revealed the extent of the country's polarization three years after the end of a civil war, which pitted American-backed contras against the Sandinistas.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Day Mixed As Dow Moves Up 1.11

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday despite a strong performance by the bond market, where prices gained and yields fell on employment figures that traders interpreted as showing the economy was still underperforming.
Analysts said the chief reason for the stock market's lackluster performance was investor concern over forthcoming third-quarter corporate earnings reports. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down more than 25 points at midday, closed with a gain of 1.11 points, to 3,584.74; it gained 3.63 for the week. New York Stock Exchange volume was heavy at 243.6 million shares traded, compared with 255.2 million on Thursday. The number of issues that gained in price exceeded decliners by 1,109 to 850.
"Although bonds firmed they are not apt to lend support to stocks in coming weeks, as traders sense interest rates may be bottoming," said Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president and market analyst at Tucker Anthony. "Softness in utilitiy shares may be reflecting this concern."
Mr. Laubscher added that with most stocks currently at high prices, "traders are casting about for groups still seen as being undervalued, and pollution control and precious metals could be beneficiaries of this casting about."
 
The Most Active Issues

Among active issues yesterday,Western Waste Industries fell 6 3/4, to 11, after saying its proposed merger with Browning-Ferris Industries was canceled because the two companies were unable to agree on definitive terms. Shares of Browning-Ferris rose 5/8, to 24.
Liberty Media fell 3 1/4, to 25 1/4, in active trading. The television programming company is being bought by Tele-Communications for $3.8 billion in stock, less than the market had expected. Also, three shareholder class action suits were filed in Delaware Chancery Court yesterday to block the proposed merger. Shares of Tele-Communications were up 1 5/8, to 27 1/2.
Detroit Diesel attracted strong demand in its initial public offering. The truck engine manufacturer's stock closed at 25 7/8 in its first day of trading, up 29 percent from the offering price of $20 a share.

HEADLINE: Sluggish Jobs Data Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The labor market improved only modestly in September as payroll jobs expanded by 156,000 and the unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent, its two-year low, the Labor Department reported today.
Although the basic figures closely matched consensus expectations, some of the secondary numbers reflected more weakness than had been expected. Among the weaker of these was an 18-minute cut in the length of the private-sector workweek, a seventh straight decline in the number of jobs in factories and a sharp increase in the length of jobless spells. 
 The report, which was the first comprehensive gauge of the economy's overall performance for the month, sent the dollar down against the German mark and other European currencies, and ignited a powerful rally in the bond market, driving interest rates down across the entire spectrum.
Yields on the 30-year bond retreated below 6 percent. [Page 48.]
 
No Rise in Wages
 The bond market was also encouraged, economists said, by the report of no change in average hourly earnings in September after a sizable August rise.
The overall report was "a bit disappointing," said James W. Coons, chief economist at the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. He pointed particularly to the jump, to 9.1 weeks from 8.4 weeks, in the median duration of unemployment.
As a result, Mr. Coons trimmed by one-quarter of a point his estimate for economic growth in the just-concluded third quarter, to a rate of 3.25 percent. That is still a gain from the 1.9 percent pace in the second quarter, but few analysts expect to see much further acceleration in 1994.
Robert G. Dederick, executive vice president of the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said he was neither encouraged nor discouraged by today's report, which included optimistic elements like job growth in heavy machinery and other industries that had been faring poorly. He also cited some statistical quirks that made interpretation difficult.
Noting that the payroll expansion of 156,000 was quite close to the average so far this year, Mr. Dederick concluded that the economy continued to "slog" ahead.
 
Improvement in East
 Geographically, today's data showed that the unemployment rate eased in the Northeast and South, to 7 percent and 6 percent, respectively, while it rose in the Midwest and West, to 5.9 percent and 8.1 percent.
Among the 11 individual states for which figures were reported today, a 1.7-point leap in Ohio's unemployment rate, to 7.3 percent, was far the largest change among any of the states covered. Analysts point out that the state results are far more erratic than the national ones because of smaller survey samples and that for most states a move must be at least a full percentage point to be considered statistically significant.
The rate for Illinois climbed to 8.5 percent from 7.6 percent, while New York and New Jersey moved in opposite directions from one another -- New York down eight-tenths of a point, to 7.1 percent, and New Jersey up six-tenths of a point, to 7.7 percent. The unemployment rate in New York City was 8.7 percent in September, down from 9.5 percent in each of the previous two months.
The jobless rate for California moved up four-tenths of a point, to 9.4, the report also showed. Excluding California, the biggest state, the national jobless rate was 6.3 percent.
 
No School Effect
 A Labor Department official said the delay in the start of the school year in New York City had no discernible effect on the employment figures since teachers remained on payrolls and students with temporary jobs seemed to stop working before Labor Day.
An unusually long period between the August and September survey weeks swelled the payroll total by about 25,000, one official estimated, but this was roughly offset by a lower seasonally adjusted count for jobs in the construction and amusement industries.
Also muddying the report was a rise of 54,000 in local government jobs, so big in view of tight school and other budgets as to be suspect, according to various analysts, who added that such figures at this time of the year might be skewed by lagging effects of summer job programs.
Retail trade, the report also showed, added 41,000 jobs last month and health services added 36,000 despite flat employment in hospitals. Moreover, the electronic equipment industry did not lose jobs for the first time in six months; the loss in aircraft manufacturing was the smallest in two years and the finance, insurance and real estate group added 10,000 jobs, mostly in financial institutions.
 
Some Sectors Lose More
 The loss of 18,000 jobs in factories was unusual in that it was concentrated in the nondurable sectors, like food processing, printing and publishing and the manufacturing of apparel, rubber and plastics. The majority of the lost factory jobs involved middle managers, who accounted for 11,000 of the total with the remaining 7,000 coming from production workers.
Business services were unusually weak, mainly reflecting the fact that temporary-help agencies failed to add jobs after having been a major job generator for the last two years.
Another unusual result, one also contributing to the bond rally, was that the revision in the August payroll figure was downward. The change was tiny, 2,000 jobs, but analysts have become accustomed to substantial upward revisions.
The survey of households, meanwhile, registered a drop of 253,000 in jobs last month after an exceptionally big gain of 409,000 in August. But the labor force also fell, by 395,000, allowing the unemployment rate to remain at 6.7 percent, one point below its June 1992 peak.
Still, the quarterly tally of discouraged workers -- those who have given up looking for jobs because they think they cannot find one -- eased a bit in the July-September period, to 1,122,000 from 1,202,000 in the spring.
Whites were slightly more discouraged; blacks substantially less so.
Among the long-term jobless, the ranks of those out of work 15 to 26 weeks swelled by 75,000 last month while those jobless for more than six months grew just 6,000 to remain slightly below the July level.
After a talk to a group of institutional investors in New York today, Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, said he was encouraged by the job growth in the report but he lamented the long periods of joblessness.
Reflecting the decline in the workweek from extremely high levels, the index of aggregate weekly hours slipped a full point, to 123.8, today's report also showed. On the other hand, the percentage of industries adding workers surged to 54.5 from 43.4, recovering most of an August plunge. The gain among manufacturers was even more striking -- to 49.6 from 34.5.

HEADLINE: Rally Sends 30-Year Yield Below 6%

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Bond market investors interpreted the September employment report as strong evidence of a weak American economy, and they sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond plunging to 5.92 percent yesterday.
More than any other security, the 30-year bond reflects the opinions of millions of bondholders concerning inflation, and yesterday by buying the bonds in big quantities -- driving up the price and driving down the yield -- they voted that inflation was unlikely to rise in the foreseeable future. 
 The 30-year bond jumped more than a point, to 10420/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction to the price, fell to 5.92 percent from 6.01 percent. Yields on other Treasury issues also fell, with the 10-year note dropping to 5.25 percent from 5.32 percent.
 
Even Lower Yields Are Seen
 "The Treasury bond yield is definitely on a new leg down," said Jay Goldinger, a bond trader for Capital Insight, a bond brokerage house in Los Angeles. "The employment report reaffirmed the feeling that the economy is not growing at a pace that will create inflation."
Mr. Goldinger, like other analysts, said that if the reports on the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index to be released on Thursday and Friday failed to show new inflationary pressures, then long-term yields could fall further, with the 30-year bond breaking below its old low of 5.86 percent, set on Sept. 8.
In the month since then, bonds have been trading in a narrow range as investors tried to decide whether the economy, and with it the inflation rate, might be strengthening or weakening. The September unemployment report, released early yesterday, seemed to provide a strong answer, and bond prices rose quickly as investors moved in from the sidelines.
 
Signs of Weakness
 "The employment report skewed the odds toward weakness rather than strength, and a weak economy means less inflation," said Matthew Alexy, government trading strategist for CS First Boston.
Bond traders had anticipated that the Labor Department would report an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent in September, unchanged from August, and that job growth would come in at about the 156,000 that was reported. What the market did not anticipate, Mr. Alexy and others said, was that 71,000 of the new jobs would be in government and only 85,000 in the private sector. For the third quarter, the nation averaged 90,000 new jobs a month in the private sector compared with 165,000 a month in the second quarter.
No analyst concluded that the employment report signaled a recession, only an economy that has failed to shake off its sluggish growth 30 months after the last recession ended, defying numerous forecasts earlier this year that the economy would by now be growing more strongly than it is.
"With this kind of labor market activity, it is hard for the economy to overheat as it did last year at this time," Mr. Alexy said. "And that was one of the worries that people had."
A drop in the average weekly workweek reinforced the notion of a weak labor market, along with the report that manufacturers shed jobs again in September, as they have almost every month this year.
 
Watching the Fed
 Investors had also been concerned about reports that the Federal Reserve might push up interest rates before the end of the year, to stave off inflation. The job report seemed to dissipate that concern, although rates on short-term Treasury securities barely moved, suggesting that investors did not expect the Fed to ease rates, either.
"There were people around today who had wanted to buy," Mr. Goldinger said, "but they wanted to make sure that the news was O.K., and as soon as they saw that the news was O.K., they committed money to the market."
The yield on the two-year note dropped to 3.78 percent from 3.81 percent. And the discount rate on the one-year bill slipped to 3.17 percent, from 3.19 percent. But the discount rate on the six-month bill was unchanged at 3.06 percent, while the three-month bill rose to 2.97 percent from 2.96 percent.

HEADLINE: Clinton Sounds A Rallying Cry: Security for All

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that the Democratic Party should seize the theme of personal security, which he is already using to promote his health care package, as a way of persuading Americans to rally behind his proposals on everything from the economy to crime to trade.
In an address to the fall meeting of the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Clinton made only a passing reference to the American military deployment in Somalia, saying it was most important that the public focus on matters at home. 
 So in a speech that was at times reflective and at times rambling, the President emphasized his domestic priorities, lumping them under the label of security for Americans.
"If we were the party of Social Security, why can't we be the party of health security and personal security and freedom from fear?" he declared to a buoyant audience over breakfast at the Sheraton Washington Hotel.
Through the security theme, Presidential advisers say, Mr. Clinton can reassure middle-class people who fear the loss of their jobs and health coverage in a time of economic flux.
 
'This Is a Breakthrough'
 "We've been reaching for a consistency that makes things reinforce one another rather than compete with one another," Stanley Greenberg, the President's poll taker, said of the emerging strategy. "In some sense, this is a breakthrough in how to give people hope in a world that is changing and that people are fearful of."
The President spoke two days after Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, suggested in a speech that the Administration was not doing enough to calm the fears of the middle class in a world changed by the end of the cold war, a vast expansion of technical knowledge and increasingly severe limits on Government programs because of the ever-rising national debt.
Today the President, jumping from his economic package to the new family leave law to military conversion, sought to make a case that issues so disparate could be linked by the theme of security.
 
Needed Sense of Security
 "When you change a country now," he said, "you can't just pass a law and change it. You can't just write a bill and change it. You have to change the behavior of the whole country. People have to change their lives. So, we can't do that unless people feel a higher level of security. I think that's self-evident."
The mood of party leaders during this two-day meeting, which ends on Saturday, was decidedly more upbeat than it was in Albuquerque, N.M., in late June, when they spent much of their time offering post-mortems on Mr. Clinton's failed effort to get a job stimulus package through Congress.
Recent polls show Mr. Clinton's popularity on the rebound, and today both the President and David Wilhelm, the party chairman, spoke not of missteps but of their achievements and the agenda that lies ahead.
"Thanks to you, and with your help," Mr. Clinton said as he opened his 45-minute talk, "we have begun to fulfill the promise of the long campaign of 1992 and the commitment of our party to change America for the better."
 
Nothing But Praise
 Mr. Wilhelm, who earlier this year was on the defensive over the President's performance and Democratic efforts, had nothing but praise for the party today. He said the successes had paid off in fund-raising, with 100,000 new donors on the party rolls.
"For the first time in modern history," Mr. Wilhelm said, "we are matching the Republican National Committee dollar for dollar."
All the self-congratulation could not completely blot out the signs of dissension, which was evident in part by what was not said. Although he did allude to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is supposed to be a top priority of the Administration but is opposed by many Democrats, Mr. Clinton never mentioned it by name.
Inevitably, however, the issue arose at an afternoon question-and-answer session with Roy Neel, the deputy White House chief of staff, and it created an awkward moment.
In the first question to Mr. Neel, Frank Garrison, who heads the Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O. and is a member of the party's governing board, said: "On the Nafta issue, I think the Administration is wrong. I hope we'll do the Administration a favor and defeat it."
 
Ticklish Question
 His question was greeted with applause from only a few in the audience. From others, there was dead silence.
Mr. Neel responded by saying, "Obviously we know there are disagreements on this issue." He added that party members could "agree to disagree -- and it can be a constructive disagreement."
No disagreement was apparent when Mr. Clinton asked the party faithful to support bills on crime, health care and education.
"Unless we can be secure in our work and families, unless we can be secure on our streets, unless we can be secure in our health care," he said, "I'm not sure the American people will ever be able to recover the personal optimism and courage to open up to the rest of the world, to continue to reach out and break down the barriers of trade."
Mr. Clinton drew perhaps the most prolonged applause when he said the family leave bill showed that his Administration was helping people in their daily lives. He recalled how he was approached during a White House tour recently by a man whose young daughter, confined to a wheelchair, was dying.
"Her father grabbed my by the arm, and I turned around," Mr. Clinton said. "And he said, 'You know, my daughter's probably not going to make it, and because of that, these last weeks I've spent with her are the most important times of my whole life. And because of that family leave bill, I didn't have to lose my job to spend that time.' "

HEADLINE: Florio and Whitman Hit Trail After Debate

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct. 8

 BODY:
One day after their first debate, Gov. Jim Florio and his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, resumed life on the campaign trail. She visited a high school and a financial firm. He got a visit from the top Democrat in the United States, President Clinton.
The President officially came to New Jersey to lobby in support of his health care package. But in one short speech before an enthusiastic crowd at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Mr. Clinton managed, through the issue of violence in America, to link his health care proposals to one of the most popular planks in Mr. Florio's campaign: gun control. 
 Mr. Clinton said America's ability to develop a health care system that will protect every resident depended directly on the country's ability to confront its tendency towards violence. To do that, he said, the nation needs to pass a crime bill that will pay for more police and require a waiting period for buying weapons. He said the country also needed to follow New Jersey's lead in enacting a ban on semiautomatic weapons.
"We have a decision to make and it's time to make it," Mr. Clinton said. "We can't keep saying we deplore these things and it's terrible and keep extolling our American values on how much more law-abiding we are than other people and put up with this."
 
Clinton Proud of Florio
 Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Florio for his part in enacting the ban, and for making what he said were tough economic decisions -- an indirect reference to the $2.8 billion tax increase that came within months of Mr. Florio's taking office.
"We need more people in our country who are willing to call them like they see them, who will try to identify the problems and try to get up every day and try to do something about them," Mr. Clinton said. "I am proud to be associated with Jim Florio."
The visit came just one day after a gubernatorial debate in which Mr. Florio held his own but did not score a knockout punch. It was another payment on the political debt Mr. Clinton owes the Governor.
When Mr. Clinton was just one of many contenders for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Florio was one of the earliest nationally-known politicians to support him. More importantly, Mr. Florio used his influence to raise campaign funds for Mr. Clinton. New Jersey contributors added $4 million to the Clinton campaign -- second only to those in Arkansas, the President's home state.
 
White House Helps Trenton
 After winning the Democratic Party nomination, Mr. Clinton made New Jersey his first campaign stop. In February, he intervened with the Department of Health and Human Services to help New Jersey get $412 million in Medicaid reimbursements that had been held up in a yearlong dispute with the Bush Administation. Without the reimbursement, Mr. Florio faced the prospect of cutting jobs and services to balance his budget for the 1994 fiscal year.
Mr. Clinton followed up that favor by appearing in February at the annual New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce dinner in Washington. And a steady string of Clinton Administration officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno, have visited the state during the last few months.
Mr. Clinton's visit occurred with barely three weeks left before the gubernatorial election. The Presidential trip dominated news coverage in the state today and put Mr. Florio at the center of that attention as he stood alongside Mr. Clinton.
Mrs. Whitman's public schedule today had three events: a morning visit to the Beneficial Corporation office in Peapack, an afternoon visit to Hamilton High School East in Hamilton Township and a Republican dance in Lakewood this evening.
 
G.O.P. Assails Clinton Visit
 The Republicans tried to steal some attention from Mr. Florio by holding a news conference on the steps of the State House in Trenton just hours before the President's arrival in New Jersey. State leaders including Representative H. James Saxton, Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian and Virginia N. Littell, chairwoman of the State Republican Committee, showed up to proclaim Mrs. Whitman the winner of Thursday night's debate.
Mrs. Whitman's campaign called the President's visit blatantly political and demanded that Mr. Florio's campaign be assessed the estimated $45,000 cost of the trip.
"The guy came in here to take the edge off of Florio's defeat last night in the debate and that makes it a political visit," said Carl Golden, the chief spokesman for the Whitman campaign. "This is no accident of scheduling that he came here on Oct. 8 and Florio ought to pay for it."
Mr. Florio met the President at Newark International Airport and accompanied him to the medical center, where they toured a trauma unit and met with several patients who were the victims of violence.
 
Pride in Weapons Ban
 Before introducing the President, Mr. Florio reminded the audience of New Jersey's ban on semiautomatic weapons. The ban, which Mr. Florio also helped save from a repeal by the Republican-led Legislature, is one of the centerpieces of Mr. Florio's administration and has been a constant theme in his campaign.
"We fought hard to pass the toughest assault weapons ban in the country," he said. "That should be a source of pride to the people of New Jersey."
But since this was billed as an official visit, Mr. Florio tried to avoid appearing too political in his remarks. That was left to the warm-up speaker, Sheriff Armando Fontoura of Essex County.

HEADLINE: Board of Trade Investigating Rally Before Data's Release

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Did some traders make big profits from an unauthorized leak of September employment data?
The Chicago Board of Trade said today that it was investigating that possibility, after futures prices for Treasury bonds rallied sharply in extremely heavy trading two minutes before the report was released this morning. 
 "Our own time-and-sales data do show there was a run-up of the market in advance of the numbers," said a spokesman for the Chicago Board. "We are looking into it."
 
 
A Washington Inquiry
 The Labor Department, which takes precautions to keep its data secret before the 8:30 A.M., Eastern time, release, also said it was looking into reports of a possible leak. But a spokesman for the department said it was possible that the unusual activity could be a result of trading based on rumors.
Trading on leaked economic data could lead to dismissal, if not criminal prosecution, of a Government employee or a trader.
The market rallied strongly after the report's release, meaning whoever bought early made a big gain.
The Board of Trade said the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose from 1196/32 at 8:28 to 11913/32 at 8:29 and then jumped to 11928/32 at 8:29:54, just six-hundredths of a second before the report was released. The price slipped just after the report, to 1195/32 at 30 seconds after the release, but quickly rebounded after that and held its gains.
The brokers who manage trading in the pit declared a "fast market" about one minute before the report was released. That designation, which warns traders that the order trading is so rapid that the posted prices might not be keeping up, is relatively common when significant statistics are released but is unusual beforehand.
"We get fast markets all the time, but this one struck us as unusual," said David Prosperi, a Board of Trade spokesman.
Board officials said that they would unravel who made the trades and interview traders in the pit. At this point, they said, there is no indication of improper trading.
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, floor traders also noticed a price rise that some called unusual in currency futures before the report was released.

Amdahl Expects to Report Another Losing Quarter

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Amdahl Corporation said today that it expected to report a third-quarter operating loss that would be considerably larger than the loss it reported in the second quarter.
Amdahl, a maker of mainframe computers, lost $23.7 million in the second quarter. With the third-quarter loss, Amdahl will have lost money for three consecutive quarters, and analysts said it was unlikely to show near-term improvement. 
 Amdahl shares fell 87.5 cents today, closing at $5 on the American Stock Exchange.
 
Depends on Mainframes
 Amdahl's core mainframe business is particularly vulnerable to economic downturns, and unlike I.B.M., its main competitor, it lacks other lines to fall back on.
Amdahl, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., cited a continuation of depressed conditions in the market for its mainframe systems combined with intense competitive pressure on pricing as the principal reasons for its continuing losses.
Amdahl also said it expected to incur additional restructuring charges as it made operational changes necessary to address current business conditions.
"Amdahl is a narrow-line vendor, and therefore more susceptible to hiccups in the marketplace, especially when those hiccups occur in the high end," said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, a mainframe industry consulting firm.
Amdahl, like I.B.M., is suffering from perhaps premature reports of the death of the mainframe computer, which is being supplanted by decentralized work station systems, and from the continuing recession in Europe, which has prompted many large companies to postpone big capital expenditures, Mr. Djurdjevic said. He added that Amdahl had made positive steps toward diversifying but that these would take time to show results.
Amdahl announced last month that it would resell computers manufactured by Sun Microsystems Inc. and abandon its own internal effort to develop machines using Sun's Sparc processor.

Lumber Prices Up Sharply After Clinton Agreement

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Lumber prices rose sharply yesterday in reaction to an agreement between the Clinton Administration and environmental groups that opened up less land for logging than the timber industry had hoped.
November lumber jumped $9.20, to $307.50 a thousand board feet, at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
 The agreement, which must still be approved by a Federal court, would lift court injunctions blocking sales of 83 million board feet of timber on federally controlled lands.
Logging groups said that Mr. Clinton promised them earlier this year at a forest conference that 2 billion board of feet of timber could be sold in the first year of a program to free 12 billion board feet of timber over a decade.
The Administration said timber on more Federal lands would become available soon. However, the agreement reached Thursday may leave avenues through the courts that environmental groups might use to impede future timber sales.
On other commodity markets, cattle prices sank as meatpackers scaled back their bids for the animals in light of falling wholesale beef prices. Cattle not sold will go back up for auction next week, further depressing prices, Chuck Levitt, an analyst at the Alaron Trading Corporation, said.
October live cattle fell 1.125 cents, to 70.925 cents a pound, and October feeder cattle dropped 0.975 cent, to 84.15 cents a pound.
Elsewhere, energy prices also ended a relatively slow day slightly higher. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, November crude oil, which traded with a loss for most of the day, ended 6 cents higher to close at $18.55 a barrel. November heating oil gained 0.14 cent, to 55.99 cents a gallon, and November gasoline rose 0.45 cent, to 51.65 cents.
"We saw some good short-covering at the end of the day," one trader said. "That was about the only action."
After two days of sharp advances, silver prices stabilized in light trading. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, December silver slipped 2.3 cents, to $4.36 an ounce. Signs of an improving economy that would increase industrial demand for silver -- along with strong interest in silver options from Middle East investors -- had lifted the market earlier in the week.

HEADLINE: Vietnam Does Some Networking

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
A few feet from trays of crab cakes and fried shrimp and white wine, dozens of senior executives from the anchors of American industry were obediently lined up in a Plaza Hotel ballroom. They were from companies like Pfizer, Mobil and Avon, and they were waiting to shake the hand of -- and, they hoped, to have a few words with -- the First Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam.
It was not a royal dinner, but sometimes it seemed on Thursday night as if the American executives were treating the Vietnamese official, Phan Van Khai, like a prince. They flattered him. They toasted him. They gave him several standing ovations. They left little doubt that they were eager -- maybe too eager in the minds of demonstrators nearby -- to do business with a former enemy. 
 Mr. Khai, the No. 2 official in the Vietnamese Government, was in Manhattan for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Organized by the Vietnam-American Chamber of Commerce, the dinner in the Grand Ballroom at the Plaza marked the first time in decades that a high-ranking Vietnamese official had addressed representatives of American companies.
The dinner seemed to bring to the surface many of the conflicting emotions Americans hold toward Vietnam. Even as the executives ate beef tenderloin and grilled salmon with their Vietnamese guests, several Vietnamese-American and veterans groups were protesting outside the hotel.
Nearly 200 people from American corporations and firms paid $350 each to hear Mr. Khai, 59, a lifelong Communist who studied socialism in Moscow and was the former chairman of the State Planning Commission.
The executives' enthusiasm seemed prodded by the sense that sooner or later Congress will repeal the 18-year-old American economic embargo against Vietnam. In another step toward chipping away at those restrictions, President Clinton last month allowed American companies to bid on projects in Vietnam financed by international aid groups like the World Bank.
"This is a statement that American executives believe that it is time to end the embargo," Irwin Jay Robinson, president of the Vietnam-American Chamber of Commerce, said of the dinner as he surveyed the ranks of dark suits in the Grand Ballroom. "It's a statement that they believe that there are very substantial business opportunities in Vietnam."
 
'Business From Day 1'
 Peter M. Ham, a vice president at Merrill Lynch & Company, said the broad range of companies that had sent people to the dinner appeared to reflect the intense interest in Vietnam as one of the last unexplored markets.
"Read the list of the companies that are sponsoring this event: law firms, infrastructure firms, power companies, telecommunications companies," he said. "They are really curious. I can guarantee you that each one of the companies represented here has someone on their payroll in Saigon today. So when the embargo is lifted, they are effectively doing business from Day 1."
Despite the cheerful expressions of camaraderie, there was also an underlying tone of frustration and wariness to the evening.
Some executives said they were angry that European countries and Japan were aggressively pursuing business in Vietnam, while they were forced to woo officials like Mr. Khai from the sidelines. But they said they realized that they had to go out of their way to avoid offending veterans' groups, who accuse Vietnam of withholding information on Americans missing since the Vietnam War.
The issue is so sensitive that some corporations decided not to send people to the dinner, Mr. Robinson said, adding that some veterans' groups had called for boycotts of the companies that did. Only a few companies -- including Avon Products Inc. and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation -- bought full tables at the event. And some executives would not speak for attribution.
Across the street from the Plaza, about 50 Vietnamese-Americans and veterans conducted a demonstration before the event, waving signs that read, "Freedom For Vietnam" and "No Trade With Vietnam." During the cocktail hour, a middle-age veteran wearing a ribboned military-style cap slipped through security and began shouting at the executives.
"All of you have betrayed the American public!" the man said before he was removed from the room. "I hope you're proud of yourselves! You have disgraced this country!"
 
Toward a Freer Market
 In his speech, Mr. Khai sounded like a committed capitalist, noting proudly that in the last year, more than 500 American executives had visited Vietnam to study its markets and 20 companies had obtained licenses to open offices there. He stressed that the country was moving forward on reforming its economy -- a process called "Doi Moi" -- and reducing state ownership.
"We do not want to see American companies being left out or lagging behind in competing for business opportunities in Vietnam," he said, speaking through an interpreter. "Vietnam attaches great importance to building a better relationship with the United States."
The speech and Mr. Khai's responses to written questions appeared to strike a chord with many executives, who said they felt more confident about pursuing opportunities in Vietnam once the embargo is lifted.
"We've now reached the point that we did with China in the early 1970's and we did with the Russians and Eastern Europeans," said George Suter, an area president with Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceuticals company. "We need to bury the hatchet and go ahead. These animosities can't go on forever. That's totally unrealistic."

HEADLINE: Small Stocks: More Than a Fleeting Fad

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Stocks of small companies have posted impressive gains recently, but will they do better than stocks of large companies over the long haul?
A growing number of investment managers say yes, and several studies bear them out. Over the last 30 years, small companies have produced a cumulative return more than twice that of large companies, albeit with some years of gut-wrenching losses, according to Dimensional Fund Advisers, a San Mateo, Calif., investment company. 
 For an investor who has a long view and a stomach for sharp downturns, small stocks look promising, regardless of current market conditions. "We stress the long-term approach to investing in small companies, and downplay the idea that investors should try to time their investments to hit the market at a low," said George U. Souter, a vice president of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds.
Some analysts say the outstanding returns of small companies reflect superior business skills and an ability to adjust quickly to economic and market conditions. Other analysts say the top performance merely shows a lack of attention from big investors, who are deterred by skimpy research, high trading costs and an unwillingness to make hundreds of small investments in small companies rather than a few investments in large ones.
Whatever the reason, small companies have smiled on investors lately.
Mutual funds specializing in small companies had total returns of 8.3 percent in the last quarter, well above the 5.2 percent for all domestic stock funds. The Russell 2,000 index, measuring small-capitalization companies with an average market value of $205 million, is near a record high. It rose 15.9 percent in the first nine months of this year, three times the 5.3 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's 500 index of larger companies.
In response to investor interest, the Standard & Poor's Corporation plans to create an index of small-cap stocks late this year, complementing its S.& P. 500 index of large companies, and its 400 stock mid-cap index.
Among the large investors paying more attention to small-cap stocks is the College Retirement Equities Fund, which has $52 billion in common stocks. A year ago, the fund began to manage its portfolio to match not the S.& P. 500, but the Russell 3,000, which encompasses the Russell 2,000 small stocks and the 1,000 largest stocks. "We made the change precisely because the performance of the small-cap companies compared so favorably," said John H. Biggs, chairman of the New York-based fund, which manages retirement accounts for teachers.
Apart from the long-term performance of small stocks, market patterns suggest now is a particularly opportune time to buy small. Neal Litvack, executive vice president of Fidelity Investments, noted that forecasts of continued economic growth bode well for smaller companies, which tend to do exceptionally in expansions.
Edward D. Kellogg, vice president of the Keystone Investment Management Company, Boston, and author of "Small Cap Stock Investing and Portfolio Strategies for Institutional Investors" (Probus, Chicago), said the historical pattern indicated that small-cap stocks were in the early years of an "up" cycle. "For the next three or five years, the place to be is in small-cap stocks," he said.
With more pension funds and other large institutions buying small stocks, a bandwagon effect is developing. The inflow of money is pushing small stocks higher, which in turn attracts more investors.
Because the market value of the 400 largest stocks is nearly four times the value of the remaining 1,600, even small shifts away from large companies can have a big impact on small stocks. A mere 1 percent of the money invested in the 400 largest stocks, with an average market value of $5 billion, would equal 17 percent of the market value of the stocks ranked 801 through 1,200, whose average market value is $495 million.
But before individual investors follow the lead of multibillion-dollar institutions, they should ask themselves how comfortable they are with an investment whose value fluctuates widely, and whether they can tolerate sharp declines. If they can, mutual funds offer a way to create a diversified portfolio among the 4,500 companies with a market value of less than $450 million.
Vanguard's $410 million-asset Small Cap Stock Fund focuses on companies with market values of $50 million to $750 million. To hold down trading costs, which are higher for small companies than large, it operates mostly with a "buy and hold" philosophy, and recommends investors do the same.
At Fidelity's Small-Cap Stock fund, managers buy companies in the same size range, but are more likely to trade a company's stock if its outlook changes.
"These funds are intended for people with an aggressive risk profile," Mr. Litvack said. Investors who don't stay the course in bad years will miss the eventual rebound, he said.
An aggressive investor, Mr. Litvack said he could accept a 10 percent decline in a single year. Even for people willing to take that risk, he recommends limiting buying of small companies to 10 percent or 15 percent of assets invested.
Warning of 10 percent losses might seem a sugar-coated version to some. Since 1963, a group of 4,500 small stocks has lost more than 10 percent in five years, the most recent being a 19 percent drop in 1990. The heaviest losses were 25 percent in 1969, 36 percent in 1973 and 29 percent in 1974.
Ronald Peyton, chairman of Callen Associates, an adviser to pension funds, said that many large investors had reduced the risk of investing in small stocks by buying foreign stocks, because they tend to move in opposite directions. For a long-term investor with 60 percent of his money in stocks, Callen recommends that 30 percent of the stocks be foreign, 13 percent small cap, and 57 percent larger companies.
 Because very small companies have the greatest swings in prices, Mr. Kellogg of Keystone Investment has concluded that "smaller companies are good, but not the smallest."

HEADLINE: U.N. Could Pay Its Way by Selling World Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Clinton, at U.N., Lists Stiff Terms for Sending U.S. Force to Bosnia" (front page, Sept. 28), you report that the President called on the United Nations to be more selective where it sends troops in the future, saying the United States could not afford to go on subsidizing open-ended missions. 
 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the other hand, argued that if the forces of chaos concluded that the United Nations was short of breath, they would prevail simply by waiting for the world to turn its attention elsewhere. Can these two positions be reconciled?
A solution is suggested in the coming auction of a portion of the domestic airwave spectrum, with which the United States Government expects to raise about $10 billion.
Allocating scarce resources, such as airwaves on a first come, first served basis, or through a lottery, does not put those resources in the hands of those who can make the best use of them. Governments thus increasingly resort to auctions to allocate, for example, oil-drilling leases, mining rights, radio waves and television channels to the highest bidder.
But who should auction what is outside any country's jurisdiction, such as the spectrum of shortwaves for broadcasts around the world, the limited number of positions for geostationary satellites or mining rights on the seabed? Clearly, no country can arrogate to itself the right to sell those resources. The United Nations is the natural auctioneer.
Developing countries, which cannot compete equally in such auctions, should be given a fair share, for example by allocating 50 percent of global resources according to population, while auctioning the rest. Developing countries would also benefit from greater resources to finance development projects.
Auctioning scarce resources can also help prevent conflicts. When oil was discovered in Texas, rival oil companies bombarded one another's drilling towers to get at the oil first. But they soon realized they could not make a profit that way.
Today they appreciate that the United States Government assigns exclusive drilling rights to the highest bidder for a parcel of territory. They pay something, but in return they can enjoy the peace of mind that nobody else is able to take from them what they discover.
A similar service is needed at the global level, to prevent future wars over global resources. The United Nations is the logical institution for this.
Such a method to help finance United Nations peacekeeping operations and sustainable development has five advantages: (1) It frees financially strapped governments from paying ever higher contributions. (2) It gives the United Nations and its family of international organizations a more reliable source of funds for urgent global needs. (3) It avoids the divisive haggling over how much each country should contribute, since the richer countries would naturally end up paying a higher share. (4) It improves the efficiency of allocating scarce resources. And (5), it helps prevent possible future wars over those resources.

Dollar Falls Against Mark But Rises in Yen Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the German mark and several other leading currencies yesterday after the September employment report failed to convince investors that the economy is growing fast enough to push up interest rates.
 But it rose against the Japanese yen after a Treasury official said the dollar should not be allowed to fall too far in an effort to increase American exports. A weak dollar makes American goods less expensive abroad. 
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6030 marks, down from 1.6228 marks on Thursday. But it was up to 106.10 yen, from 104.94 yen.
 Meanwhile, gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for October delivery gained $3.10 an ounce, to $359.90.
 Investors sold dollars yesterday morning right after the Labor Department said nonfarm employment rose by 156,000 jobs in September. Many traders had expected a larger rise.
 "The number wasn't strong enough to satisfy the market," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange adviser at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "There are still too many questions about the economy's strength."
 The fact that August's report was revised to show a decline of 41,000 jobs, earlier reported as a drop of 39,000, also hurt the dollar. Many traders thought the figure would be increased.
 The unemployment rate remained steady at 6.7 percent.
 "People wanted to sell the dollar all week," said Amy Smith, market strategist at IDEA, a consulting firm. The possibility of a stronger-than-expected employment report had kept them from doing so, she said.
 Investors were eager to sell dollars and buy marks because they know that the German currency is in demand at European central banks. The banks have to repay Germany the marks they spent trying to defend their currencies during the European Community's exchange-rate crisis in July.
 The central banks must repay the Bundesbank within 90 days of taking the loans, said Helmut Wacket, assistant representative for the Bundesbank in New York.
 The dollar rose against the yen, meantime, as investors interpreted comments by Lawrence Summers, the Treasury's Under Secretary for International Affairs, to mean that the United States is content with the dollar's value against the yen, traders said.

The U.N.'s Glow Is Gone

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
After embracing the United Nations as the global peacemaker of the future, President Clinton has broken sharply with it over Somalia, signaling the Administration's intense displeasure with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and complicating United States participation in peacekeeping operations elsewhere.
 In his television address on Thursday, Mr. Clinton said in effect that after scores of Americans were killed or wounded in a United Nations-led raid in Mogadishu on Sunday, the United States would have no choice but to go it alone. Although he did not say it out loud, another message came through loud and clear: the United Nations is not up to the job. 
The President has also effectively turned his back on an experiment he initiated earlier this year in Somalia, when he allowed some of the American forces to serve under foreign command. Now, the Administration has returned to one of the guiding principles of post-World-War-II foreign policy: if American soldiers are put in harm's way, they take orders solely from American commanders.
 These judgments did not come easily. They are born of months of frustration and setbacks in Somalia and Bosnia that have left the Administration sadder, wiser and extremely wary of sending American troops to help make peace in other troubled nations.
 It was not supposed to be that way.
 Mr. Clinton the Presidential candidate was one of Mr. Boutros-Ghali's greatest fans, endorsing his proposal for creating an international standing army from perhaps a score of countries whose troops would be ready to risk their lives for making peace.
 The force would, said Mr. Clinton in an April 1992 speech, carry out such operations as "standing guard at the borders of countries threatened by aggression, preventing mass violence against civilian populations, providing humanitarian relief and combatting terrorism."
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher seconded that idea during his confirmation hearings last January, calling the creation of such a force a mechanism that would enable the United Nations to "not always leave it to the United States to be the action officer in a situation."
 When the United States completed the withdrawal of most of its forces from Somalia last spring, the logistical forces left behind were put under the command of a Turkish United Nations commander, while quick-response emergency combat forces were to operate under a United States command.
 The arrangement was praised as working so well that Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American representative to the United Nations, delighted in telling audiences about the doctrine of "assertive multilaterialism," which enabled the troops of more than two dozen nations to join hands in bringing stability to Somalia.
 But after June 5, when forces believed to be loyal to General Mohammed Farah Aidid killed 24 Pakistani peacekeepers, Somalia was swiftly transformed from a model for future peacekeeping operations to an object lesson in what can go wrong.
 After the unanimous passage of a Security Council resolution calling for the detention and punishment of those responsible for the attack, General Aidid became the target of the mixed United Nations-American operation, even though he was not mentioned in the resolution by name.
 
U.S. Underestimated
 But the United States underestimated the power and the appeal of the clan leader. For instance, on June 17, following the storming of General Aidid's compound, Mr. Clinton proudly announced, "The United Nations, acting with the United States and other nations, has crippled the forces in Mogadishu of warlord Aidid."
 Instead, however, the peacekeepers were dragged into an urban guerrilla war in which they were attacked by mobs, shot by snipers and blown up by land mines, exposing a disorganized United Nations military command hampered by poor intelligence and bickering among the contributing nations.
 The Administration tried on Sept. 20 to move away from the goal of capturing Mr. Aidid when Secretary of State Warren Christopher presented a political strategy to Mr. Boutros-Ghali. Clinton officials have been sharply critical of Mr. Boutros-Ghali, but they have tended to glide over the United States role in, or at least support for, the United Nations' aggressive approach to Mr. Aidid.
 And the United States could not blame the United Nations for last Sunday's attack, since it was done purely on American orders.
 Even before the bungled raid last Sunday, the Administration had moved toward defining the limits of multilateralism.
 Mr. Clinton has learned the hard way that he could not take it for granted that the allies would follow his lead, as when he proposed arming the Government of Bosnia.
 And at home, the Administration has been subjected to a chorus of critics.
 
A Chilling Effect
 Perhaps that mood was best captured by Senator Robert Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat, who, in attacking involvement in Somalia last month, told senators, "I do not see in the front of this chamber the U.N. flag. I have never saluted the U.N. flag. I salute Old Glory, the American flag."
 The attack last Sunday had a further chilling effect on Mr. Clinton's approach to peacekeeping.
 The attack has further tested Washington's already-strained relationship with Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who blames the United States for not disarming Mr. Aidid's followers and who has warned that an American pullout would destroy the Somalia operation.
 In a tense meeting on Tuesday in which Ms. Albright explained the limits of American involvement, Mr. Boutros-Ghali complained bitterly about the American decision to send Robert Oakley as Washington's special envoy to Somalia, senior Administration and United Nations officials said.
 The officials said that Mr. Boutros-Ghali told her bluntly that he has constituents other than the United States.
 
Feathers Unruffled
 By Thursday night, however, Ms. Albright had apparently managed to unruffle his feathers and his spokesman issued a statement that he was "grateful" that Mr. Clinton highlighted the achievements of the United Nations in Somalia in his speech.
 Senior Administration officials acknowledged that the unpredictability of the Somalia operation has frozen a much-debated draft of a classified paper initially intended to codify the Administration's new activist strategy for peacekeeping.
 The problems of Somalia have sprawled into other international efforts. The Pentagon has stressed that American military trainers and engineers who will arrive in Haiti in the next two weeks will not maintain the peace, disarm gunmen or help protect the exiled President, who is scheduled to return home on Oct. 30.
 As a senior Pentagon official told reporters today, if the American troops are prevented from doing their job in Haiti, "We are out of there."
 As for Bosnia, the Somalia experience will make it even more difficult for Mr. Clinton to win Congressional approval for sending 25,000 American troops to help enforce any eventual peace agreement there.
 Mr. Clinton has stanched the move in Congress for an immediate withdrawal from Somalia by promising to withdraw troops in six months. It may not be good foreign policy, but it is good politics.

HEADLINE: THE SOMALIA MISSION: Voices;
A Common Cry Across the U.S.: It's Time to Exit

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, Oct. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton's decision to send more troops to Somalia, even while setting a deadline for a final United States pullout, did not satisfy Tony Bright.
"It just won't work," he said. 
Like many Americans -- a majority, according to polls -- Mr. Bright, an emergency health care administrator, has doubts about American involvement in Somalia and President Clinton's handling of the situation.
 He favored speedy withdrawal before the President spoke late Thursday afternoon. And, like millions of other Americans, he still does.
 
'Bring the Boys Home'
 "It's really very simple," Mr. Bright said on Thursday. "If I have to choose between pictures of starving Somalian babies or dead American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, well, I don't want to see any more dead Americans. Sorry. It's time to bring the boys home."
 This morning he added, "What the President proposed doesn't change a thing for me."
 Formal and informal surveys of Americans after the President spoke indicate that he changed few minds. The demands for withdrawal are still loud and adamant, though some people who earlier wanted an immediate pullout are now willing to give the President time to recover American bodies and prisoners.
 "From here on, we shouldn't do any more than get back our dead and our prisoners and get out safely," said Carl Kamp, a retired Federal banking official from Atlanta. "If that takes a few more troops and a few more weeks, then O.K. But absolutely no escalation and don't drag it out. I don't like this."
 An ABC News poll taken shortly after the President spoke on Thursday found a majority of Americans -- 52 percent -- did not approve of Mr. Clinton's handling of the situation. On Tuesday, an ABC News poll found 53 percent did not approve. Both polls had a margin of sampling error of five percentage points.
 The recent fighting in Somalia, which left 15 American soldiers dead and more than 85 wounded, has crystallized American public opinion on an issue that previously was not particularly pressing to the average citizen. And the pictures of a dead American soldier being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu seem to have made it all but impossible for Mr. Clinton to change many minds.
 
'Get Out of There'
 "That absolutely turned me off," said Carin Steckler, a Seattle secretary. "We should get out of there."
 Penny Thompson, a food service supervisor in Lexington, Ky., also was repelled by the pictures.
 "We don't need this grief," she said. "I say turn the whole thing back over to the U.N. and let somebody else take the heat. We gave it our best and it just didn't work. If they don't care any more over there, than we don't care any more over here."
 Polls taken after the fighting in Somalia escalated but before the President spoke found that two of every three people surveyed favored American withdrawal, and about half of the respondents favored withdrawal even at the risk of leaving Somalia in more turmoil and even if another famine resulted. Interviews with about 100 Americans around the country indicate the President has done little to change those numbers and opinions.
 In Houston, Rick Coe, a park ranger, said that the United States, for all its good intentions, should pull out of Somalia because it had turned into "a nightmare, a quagmire, a death trap."
 "It's a no-win situation," he added. "That's indicative to get out."
 In New York City, Claudia Berns, a travel consultant, reached a similar conclusion.
 "Originally we were there to restore order and feed people," she said. "At this point, we should get out. The people there haven't backed us."
 
'Hard to Back Out'
 Another New Yorker, Calvin Harrison 3d, a security supervisor, said he not only opposed Mr. Clinton's proposal to stay in Somalia a while longer but had opposed intervention in Somalia back during the Bush Administration.
 "I don't think we should have been there in the first place," he said. "I don't think the troops are doing anything. We should get out. Our soldiers are dying."
 Here and there around the country, the interviews did find some support and understanding for President Clinton's position.
 "It's kind of hard to back out when they're dragging Americans down the street," said Barbara Bolt, a concession stand operator in Houston. "We've got to go in there and get them, then just pull everybody back out."
 Kevin Dyes, a customer service representative for a telephone company in Cincinnati, said: "If it takes more force, we'll have to do it. Because if we pull out, it's going to cost lives."
 In Kansas City, Mo., Dave Brown, a computer engineer, said he supported the President because the job in Somalia is not finished.
 "If it takes more troops, we need to send them," he said. "We've got to take on these ideas or nobody else will."
 Still, for the most part the interviews turned up negative reaction to Mr. Clinton's speech and proposals.
 In particular, the interviews uncovered deep concern that the nature of the United States mission in Somalia was becoming more military oriented than humanitarian. Few respondents saw Somalia posing a significant military threat to the United States, especially in the post-cold-war era.
 "We started out giving food and now we're shooting bullets and getting shot at in a little country that really doesn't amount to much," said Ed Steelman, a carpenter from Bethel, Ohio. "That's flat crazy. And now the President is talking about getting in deeper? Hard to believe."
 Somewhat surprisingly, given the national agony caused by the American retreat from Vietnam, there seems to be no overbearing concern in the nation that a retreat from Somalia would make the United States appear weak, defeated and indecisive.
 President Clinton warned that a hasty retreat would reflect badly on the nation and its standing in the world. But many Americans nevertheless tend to see a pullout almost as a sign of strength and confidence and, not least of all, proof that the United States is gaining a more sophisticated and mature view of what its role should be in the international arena.
 
'We Keep Blundering'
 "There are common-sense limits to our moral responsibilities to the rest of the world," said Gene Pinder, the public relations manager at the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga. "We've had the good common sense to stay out of the Bosnia quagmire so far and nobody's calling us the world's coward. We're the world's only superpower now. Life is no longer us versus the Russians. We can cut it off and leave Somalia because Somalia no longer makes good sense."
 But while most Americans tend not to draw a close parallel between a retreat from Somalia and the traumatic flight from Vietnam, the American experience with "nation building" in Vietnam has nevertheless left many people wary that a similar experience -- and failure -- in nation-building could occur in Somalia.
 "Somalia is not a sophisticated Western society," said Pat Finley, a retired paper company executive from Atlanta. "We keep blundering into these kinds of places because of our natural American generosity. But sooner or later we're going to have to face up to the cold fact that this is another of those countries where we can't impose democracy at an acceptable cost, if at all. They're not ready for it, can't handle it yet."
 So what should the United States do?
 "Get out," Mr. Finley replied. "We should never have gone there in the first place."
 The widespread American aversion to involvement in Somalia does not appear to be grounded in a new isolationism. Rather, it seems to result from a feeling that the nation should temper its do-good tendencies with a solid measure of international practicality.
 "Situations like Somalia are going to come up again and again and we're going to have to learn to deal with them better," said Dick Bryant, a commercial photographer from Chattanooga. "We need to develop a policy that says, 'Don't get involved if it's not doable.' We have to be very tough on ourselves when we do this."
 And what of Somalia, using this approach?
 "Not doable," Mr. Bryant replied.

HEADLINE: Sublime Design

BYLINE: By Laurel Graeber; Laurel Graeber is the author of the text for "Color: Natural Palettes for Painted Rooms" (Clarkson Potter). She writes frequently on design and antiques.

 BODY:
The Wheel. The Teapot. The Stradivarius violin. Some designs are of such obvious beauty and worth that they are destined to last for centuries. Others lack esthetic appeal but seem sublime because they fulfill so completely the needs of the moment -- how much harder was life before the bendable straw and the paper clip? But for the individual, what is truly valuable is what inspires passion, and here there's plenty of room for difference.
So, although there's no accounting for taste, we asked 10 design-savvy people to account for theirs. Their task was to name an everyday object that, in their view, is perfectly designed. While opinions varied, a few trends emerged: Simplicity is revered more than ornament. Function is just as important as beauty. And the Shakers, while they didn't believe in procreation, still have enthusiastic heirs. 
 Tony Victoria, the owner of Frederick P. Victoria & Son, Manhattan antiques dealers:
"I have a personal penchant for clocks. On my desk is a plastic one called The Time Pyramid: It's about six inches tall, in the shape of a pyramid, and it's divided into sections. The top part turns a full revolution every 60 seconds, the middle section every 60 minutes, and the bottom every 12 hours. It has a great rugged look, and a pyramid is such a classic and, if you will, spiritual shape. It does the job well, and it's fun to watch. It was given to me by Herve Aaron for my birthday five years ago, so here you have two antiques dealers getting involved in some wonderful modern stuff."
 
Tim Zagat, the publisher of Zagat Survey, based in New York City:
"I love the Washington Monument. It is one of the most gorgeous, simple, elegant things in the world. It combines power and grace, which are criteria for any of the objects I would consider well designed. And this monument is one of many things that are available free of charge that are still very satisfying -- I suppose that's the ultimate in value."
 
Patricia von Musulin, a New York City artist and jewelry designer:
"Of what I own personally, the most sublime is my Steinway piano. It is masterfully designed, has the capacity to yield extreme emotion and it's uplifting. You generate this pure sound that's exalted and refined. I've had the piano for years, and I intend to have it until I die.
"My second choice would be my Buccellati sterling-silver flatware. After a long day, I could eat standing on one foot in the kitchen, or I could actually set a place. Using this flatware makes me sit down, eat slowly and savor my food. The weight of the silver somehow makes it a more civilized activity."
 
Larry Totah, an architect based in Los Angeles:
"There are a few things I'm keen on, and one is the candle. It's simple, basic, straightforward and easy to make, which is something lacking in design these days. But what's also important is how candles are used. They create instant mood at a very affordable price. They're timeless and have spiritual value. I also find them, surprisingly, the ideal lighting. I use them all over my home -- just the ordinary beeswax type, about 12 inches long. I even write and draw by candlelight. I find it very healing."
 
Andree Putman, a Paris-based interior designer:
"We are now in convalescence from the 1980's, which made design too important and too much a tool of fame. So rather than pick a trendy new object, I'd rather talk about the designs without designers that have wit, enormous charm and are often mass-produced. A Chinese ginger grater made of bamboo is a modest, beautiful object. Or a Greek coffee cup or Shaker furniture -- these have soul and meaning and interesting ideas behind them. I also think of American quilts. There's something wonderful about the hand-me-down clothes of a whole family becoming a gentle little blanket."
 
Christopher Burge, the president of Christie's in America, New York City:
"It's embarrassing in some ways, but I love the plastic and metal corkscrew that sits on its own little stand. It is an unfailingly simple way of opening a good bottle of wine, or a bad one. With the average corkscrew, you tug at it and your apartment almost explodes. This one is successful every time. It doesn't have the double screw -- you turn it in only one direction -- and it gets down into the cork and also lifts it out. The other great joy is that it's not expensive -- under $20."
 
Thomas Moser, the owner of Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers, based in Auburn, Me.:
"Whenever I give a lecture, I begin with a slide of what to me is a universal object: a pulley of ash and wrought iron made by the Shakers in 1840. It's a very humble tool, used for hoisting heavy objects, and it's perfectly made. Every aspect of the design springs from how it is to be used. It has an economy of material and form to which nothing can be added and from which nothing can be taken. I see it as a metaphor for everything we try to do."
 
Viscount David Linley, the designer and chairman of David Linley Furniture in London:
"I choose the British postbox, because it is not only a functional piece of street furniture, but it's also beautifully designed. It reflects the architecture fashionable during the reign of Queen Victoria and remains in style to the present day. It is a utilitarian object with wonderful architectural details -- the curved top and dentils underneath are pleasing to the eye. It has come to symbolize traditional England, and I am proud to see it on our street corners."
 
Peter Eisenman, an architect based in Manhattan:
"I have an oversized metal Venetian bottle opener, or cavatappi. It is a corkscrew that is the size of the bottle it is meant to open, so it is not the object which is necessarily sublime, but the relationship of its size to its function. With an outsized head and arms, it is played with as a mechanical doll by my 2-year-old son. The opener never misses seizing the entire cork, and because of its giant size, its levered arms remove the cork with ease. And with a gentle reverse spin of the handle, it leaves a pristine cork, free to be tested and eventually replaced in the bottle whence it came."
 
Isaac Mizrahi, a Manhattan-based fashion designer:
"I have an Hermes agenda of Scotch-grain leather. The pages are very broad and the paper is good enough to save and catalogue. There's a little address book in the back that's detachable, and it has just one pocket. It's not a Filofax that assumes you carry the world with you; it just assumes you want your agenda. It cost me about $800, and it's lasted for 10 years. It doesn't look new, but it looks great.
"I also have this white metal generic folding chair from Pottery Barn that's about $12. It's like a regulation yoga chair. It's the perfect height, the perfect slope of the back, and you can do a lot of poses with it. I have several, they fit into any closet, and they're good to bring out when you need a fourth for bridge.
"As for bridge, I love the Tiffany bridge set. My favorite is a Tiffany blue on one side and a Tiffany green on the other. I love them monogrammed. The cards are not sticky, not too small or too large, not too thick. And the chic of Tiffany is wonderful to reference while you're playing."

HEADLINE: ON LANGUAGE;
Leaping the Rhetorical Gap

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
AT A MEETING with the President in the Cabinet Room, with mouth-filling words like multilateral and multinational flying around, a Senator wondered if they weren't losing touch with the words that real people use in everyday life.
That off-the-record remark about our language was promptly leaked to this department. At a subsequent interview with President Clinton, I used it to form the basis for a penetrating question. (Actually, my question was a not overly harsh "Can you give me a little more on that?" but even so, it penetrated.) 
 "Today I think that we still don't speak in a language that ordinary Americans can understand," Mr. Clinton replied. He believed that the diplomatic lingo we now use fails to "support the kind of bipartisan engagement that I'm convinced the United States has to have." In this President's phrase (bottomed on "the missile gap" charge by candidate John Kennedy in 1960), the nation has been presented with the problem of "a rhetorical gap."
Apparently this Presidential discontent registered on his staff. The need to reject the no-longer-pertinent language of the cold war -- from Lenin's peaceful coexistence to Churchill's iron curtain to George Kennan's containment -- reached the writers in the White House basement who are working on national security affairs. How do you go about building a new vocabulary? You start with a single word.
The chosen word is enlargement. In a seminal speech to the School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University, Anthony Lake, national security adviser to the President, used the noun enlargement or the verb enlarge 20 times. I take that to be a subtle signal that the word is intended to be associated with the approach the Clinton Administration is taking to foreign affairs. Here are 2 of the 20 drumbeats: "The successor to a doctrine of containment must be a strategy of enlargement, the enlargement of the world's free community of market democracies."
Within 48 hours, the word reverberated in the speech of the chief delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright. She enumerated the "four overarching goals" -- bond-strengthening, emerging-democracy aid, rogue-state isolation, chaos-containment -- in a strategy that "looks to the enlargement of democracy and markets abroad."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, however, in a speech the same week, resisted enlargement, preferring engagement, a word put forward in the 80's by Gary Hart and later by James Baker. In "the latest round in a century-old debate between engagement and isolationism," the Secretary said, "the United States chooses engagement."
The choice was once posed as between intervention and isolation; however, interventionists were able to shuck that label, with its hawkish and jingoistic connotations, in favor of internationalist. Meanwhile, isolationists remained with their heads in the sand; the slogan "America First" carries too much pre-World War II baggage. Anti-interventionists have failed to choose a label for themselves, so they are stuck with isolationist, chosen by their adversaries.
The intervention crowd, having had success in the containment era, and alert to the pejorative nature of involvement or entanglement, has long been leery of interventionist and worries that internationalist sounds too U.N.-y.
Should it choose engagement or enlargement? This question is evidently roiling the waters between the White House basement and Foggy Bottom; though the Christopher-Lake-Albright speeches were policy-coordinated, what Mr. Clinton called the "rhetorical gap" was not closed.
I'm all for a new word to describe America's role in the world, but somehow enlargement doesn't do it for me. First, there is the connotation of swelling: enlargement of the spleen or the prostate comes to mind. Then we have the photographic sense, with its synonym of "blowup"; surely that is not what diplomats seek. Mr. Clinton may want to grow the economy, as he says frequently, but are we metaphorically ready to grow democracy? Is a generation that celebrates Robert Browning's "less is more" ready for a new enlargement policy?
No; let us eschew this slapsy maxi. As a card-carrying intervenor (my preference as a human-rights hawk), I vote for engagement -- not only because of its dim naval-battle origin, with inherent rules, but also for its previous commercial association with the loveliness and success derived from cleansing cream: "She's lovely; she's engaged; she uses Pond's."
The President is undecided. In his United Nations speech, he said the United States "plans to remain engaged" and also "we seek to enlarge the circle of nations" with free institutions.
The Battle of Rhetorical Gap continues to rage.
 
THE LATEST ISSUE
 THE ECONOMY IS A bread-and-butter issue, at least among pundits not worried about cholesterol; abortion and gun control are hot-button issues; Nafta, causing splits within each party, is a wedge issue. What kind of issue is health care reform?
It's a kitchen-table issue. Talk-show hosts (host now covers both sexes; I am still waiting for the hostess to be seated) and news-magazine writers covering health reform have glommed on to this locution.
For its provenance, I turned to Dialog Information Services in Iselin, N.J., the Knight-Ridder computer library that provides access to some 400 data bases -- newspapers and magazines, outfits that cover radio and television shows, texts of vital and not-so-vital speeches, and far-out technical publications. (It marks the searched-for term with crosshatches, a timesaver.)
In a Boston Globe poll reported on July 15, 1984, a category of likely voters was described thus: "Understands and cares about kitchen table issues," and that phrase was defined as "the problems that everyday working people face in trying to make ends meet." In 1988, Judy Mann of The Washington Post wrote that Sarah Harder, president of the American Association of University Women, believed that "women will be voting kitchen table issues in the 1988 election. Not women's issues, not bread and butter issues, but kitchen table issues. 'They come,' said Harder, 'from the center of family life.' " The writer cited care-giving as one example of the issue; others are education, use of leisure time and, of course, health.
A bread-and-butter issue focuses exclusively on economics: "Can we afford this or not?" A kitchen-table issue asks, more broadly, "What's best for the family, and how can we work it out?" The locution covers a sociopolitical as well as an economic range, and fulfills a linguistic need; with the first two words hyphenated as befits a compound adjective modifying the noun issue, it should be part of the comprehensive basic issue package that cannot be taken away.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Broadway Flops Go to CD Heaven

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
IT SEEMS ALMOST EMBARRASSING NOW THAT ON A crisp early winter night in 1964 I had nothing better to do in my young life than walk up to the box office of the Shubert Theater and buy a ticket for "Bajour."
"Bajour": The title doesn't exactly roar down memory lane 30 years later, does it? In truth, even at the time, it was the kind of carefree Broadway musical designed to be forgotten during intermission. When Act II began, you counted on the characters to remind you of just what they were doing when the curtain fell 15 minutes earlier. The show was so artificial, so hermetically sealed in the creakiest conventions of musical comedy, that its every line abhorred any cohesive connections to human experience as practiced beyond Shubert Alley. 
 But for an indiscriminately stage-struck 15-year-old who had seen every respectable play in town at least once, there seemed no plausible alternative to "Bajour." For one thing, M. K. had raved it -- M. K. being an anonymous but ubiquitous graffiti scribbler of the time, perhaps also 15, who specialized in scrawling his own critical pronouncements in quote-ese on the posters in the theater district. Although M. K. routinely wielded his Magic Marker to dismiss the street's reigning hits ("A big bore! -- M. K" was the verdict on "Hello, Dolly!"), he had pronounced "Bajour" the "best musical in town!" Also to the point, for me anyway, was the fact that "Bajour" had just opened and, like most musicals of the time, had enough of a theater-party advance to assure sold-out performances early in the run. A sold-out house meant the liberation of standing-room tickets. I preferred standing room not only because it was cheap -- still three bucks or less -- but because I had a romantic attachment to watching plays from the rear of the house, a consequence of my part-time job as a ticket taker back home in Washington at the National Theater, an active tryout house of the time.
"Bajour." I hadn't thought about the show much since 1964 until last year when I was trolling the racks of my local record store and discovered, to my amazement, that its original-cast recording was abundantly displayed in a shiny new CD re-release by Sony, its cover that same poster image that M. K. had merrily defaced all those years ago.
I had to laugh. What audience could there possibly be for "Bajour" in the 1990's? Chita Rivera fanatics? (She starred in it, as a Gypsy who sang a palm-reading ballad, "Love-Line.") Collectors of Michael Bennett juvenilia? (He danced in the chorus.) Students of the journalistic canon of Joseph Mitchell? It was Mr. Mitchell's New Yorker magazine reportage about Gypsies in New York that inspired "Bajour," though the show itself was less interested in ethnic verisimilitude than in the marital prospects of its heroine, an aspiring young anthropologist with a meddling Jewish mother. The mother was played by none other than Mae Questel, the original voice of Hollywood's animated Betty Boop. The anthropologist was Nancy Dussault, who finally embraced romance after singing the lyric:
 
 Love is a chance made to be taken
Why should I take to my heels?
Why run away from mayhem that may come?
Maybe I'd like how it feels.
Love is a chance flighty and fleeting
Here like quicksilver, then gone.
Hi ho quick Silver! I'm riding with you
Whether it's hither or yon.
See how my heart's open wide -- hey there!
Love, take a good seat inside -- and stay there!
You had to be there.
As it turns out, the "Bajour" CD was only one example of a flood of Broadway kitsch that Sony, Angel, RCA and MCA have been sending forth during the last two years. With considerable energy, technical expertise and expense, these labels have revived the original-cast recordings of often unrevivable musicals from the mid-1940's to the mid-1970's. Shows that originally never made it as far as Cleveland now can be reconsidered with the aid of booklets offering elaborate scholarly apparatus, in some cases in German, French and Italian as well as English. As a friend of mine from those teen-age years recently wondered, "Is it possible that M. K. grew up to become the head of Sony records?"
To be sure, many of the new releases are of the expected hits, sonically remastered and sometimes expanded with alternate tracks retrieved from dusty vaults. (Particularly elegant among the retooled classics are MCA's restored original-cast recordings of "Oklahoma!" and "Carousel," Sony's of "South Pacific.") But what fascinates me most are all the releases of recordings that might be classified as marginalia and trivia -- in some cases recordings that had scant audiences in their initial airing, souvenirs of forgotten shows so routine that they cannot even aspire to the status of cult flops. Stephen Sondheim's "Anyone Can Whistle," which ran nine performances at the Majestic Theater in 1964 but whose cast recording has rarely been out of print since, is a cult flop. So are "Candide," "House of Flowers" and "She Loves Me" in their original productions. By contrast, "Bajour," which ran 232 performances, or seven months, shortly after "Anyone Can Whistle" closed in a week, is merely a flop. Some of the shows in the tidal wave of Broadway reissues, like "Plain and Fancy" and "Golden Boy," belong to an equally ignominious category -- the forgotten hit.
Great artistic claims can be made for few, if any, of these second-rung recordings, although in almost all cases they are far superior to the shows themselves. (My own critical rationalizations for listening to them are reflected in the lists accompanying this article.) As a group, however, they impale in digital sound what in retrospect was the last dying gasp of the Broadway musical as an abundant mainstream American entertainment industry.
True, Broadway musicals are not extinct today, and occasionally a new one comes along that can be discussed in the same sentence as the classics. But the economy and culture that allowed a dozen or more musicals to prosper on Broadway in a typical season -- most of them neither smash hits nor overnight flops but middling shows of the type canonized in the new CD's -- are long gone. Today, brand-new American musicals are so costly to mount that they threaten to become semi-annual events on Broadway. The throwaway Broadway musical, which might recoup its investment with a one-season New York run and a subsequent tour, is extinct. A theater like the Shubert or Winter Garden, which might have housed a new show (or two) every season (or two) 30 years ago, is now tied up by a single show for a decade.
YET EVEN IF BROADWAY'S economics permitted a dozen new musicals a season, it is hard to imagine who would write them or see them. Few new songwriters have been welcomed to Broadway since rock music solidified its hold on mainstream American culture in the 1960's; many of the major American songwriters of Broadway 1993 (Sondheim, Styne, Kander and Ebb, Coleman, Strouse) were in place at the time of "Bajour," just as this year's Tony-winning musical actress, Ms. Rivera, was. Similarly, the middle-class theatergoers, often roped in by theater parties and brokers, who would support a "Bajour" for a season -- while waiting to get into the big hits -- are dead, retired, no longer in New York or unable or unwilling to spring for $65 tickets. They have not been replenished by a young audience, whose musical tastes are scantily represented on modern Broadway.
Listening to the lesser musicals of the 50's and 60's again in their new sonic packages, I realize that even at the time I should have known the genre as it then existed was doomed. The Broadway musical's last peak came in the late 1950's -- "My Fair Lady," "West Side Story," "The Music Man," "Gypsy," "The Sound of Music" -- with shows whose scores remain as much a part of the period's enduring pop culture as Elvis. But only a few years later, the gap between Broadway entertainment, an increasingly minority taste, and the rest of the culture was enormous. "Hello, Dolly!" (1964), a smash hit that actually piled up a longer run than "My Fair Lady," seems to harken from a distant, different century than contemporaneous compositions by the Beatles and Bob Dylan.
By then, Broadway was well into its decadent phase, when silly, brassy musical comedies continued to roll off the assembly line even though their audiences, authors and cultural rationale were disappearing. Though superior relics of this old school, like "Dolly" and "Funny Girl" and "Mame," were still immensely popular in the 60's, the many also-rans in their style, shows like "Subways Are for Sleeping" and "High Spirits," amounted to filler. None of them would be produced on the prohibitive Broadway of today, where the few fluffy new musicals attempted are recyclings of the past ("Crazy for You," "Guys and Dolls") and where most new musicals (also few) are musical dramas like "Les Miserables" and "Kiss of the Spider Woman" in the image of weightier 60's shows like "Fiddler on the Roof" and "Cabaret."
The brainless, second-rate musicals of the late 1950's and early 1960's were still fun to watch, at least to a wide-eyed youth of the time. They aspired to nothing more than commercial entertainment and were professional of their kind. Since I had in part sought out the fantasy world of the theater, as so many adolescents do, to seek refuge from a real world that I found inhospitable, these colorful shows offered complete escape. They were not my first choices for a night at the theater, but they served honorably while I waited for those infrequent nights of higher art to come along.
What made these mediocre musicals theatrical was their vulgar energy, their brazen self-assurance (however unearned), their genetic trace memories of vaudeville and burlesque rituals (however diluted) dating back to before I was born. Their performers were committed to what they were doing, which was to sing and dance in a larger-than-life idiom that television and movies abhorred. The shows boasted heat and light and noise, a freneticism that echoed the neon-hued tumult of the Times Square that spawned them. They made a boy trapped in what was then a provincial Southern town feel nearer to the distant theater capital of his hyperventilated, insomniacal imaginings. In that sense, a disposable show like "Bajour" was closer in spirit to the honky-tonk Broadway of its time than was "My Fair Lady," which was and is timeless.
Yet nostalgia for these musicals must be held in check. Their kinetic energy, severed as it was from first-rate songwriting, produced a tinny sound. For the performers who strained to put them over, they were dead ends. By the early 60's, the stars of the Broadway musical's last vintage era, Merman and Martin and Raitt and Drake and Channing, were nearing the final stage of their careers. No matter how hard the new, younger Broadway musical talents worked, they had arrived too late to achieve the same magnitude of stardom.
The only real musical-comedy stars that Broadway produced in this period, Julie Andrews and Barbra Streisand, immediately decamped to Hollywood, never to return. The others took what work they could. An ingenue like Nancy Dussault, proclaimed an overnight sensation (and instantly booked on "The Ed Sullivan Show") after her debut in a Phil Silvers vehicle, "Do Re Mi," in 1960, had no hope of finding the roles that might make her the next Mary Martin. Instead, she became Mary Martin's final replacement in the Broadway production of "The Sound of Music." From there, it was on to "Bajour."
To me, a paradigmatic musical of this period of decline was "Mr. President" (among the Sony reissues), which had a three-week tryout in Washington on its way to Broadway in 1962. The show marked Irving Berlin's emergence from his self-imposed retirement after "Call Me Madam" in 1950. Berlin's collaborators included the producer Leland Hayward (lately of "Gypsy" and "The Sound of Music") and the director Joshua Logan ("South Pacific" and half the Broadway dramatic hits of the 50's). The authors of the book were Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, whose credits included signature Broadway hits of three decades -- the 30's ("Anything Goes"), 40's ("Life With Father") and the 50's ("The Sound of Music").
What could go wrong? The pandemonium surrounding the production was such that the manager of the National Theater refused to accept mail orders and returned 4,000 pieces of unsolicited mail, much of it containing blank checks. The advance-sale box office was opened on Labor Day to avoid jamming downtown Washington streets on a business day, and the entire run was sold out by noon two days later. The real Mr. President and his wife, who were lightly spoofed from the stage, presided over a charity-benefit opening night, though Kennedy missed the first act to watch a closed-circuit broadcast of the Liston-Patterson fight back at the White House.
He didn't miss much. "Mr. President" was accurately described as a "clinker" and "a timid bore" by the local press, and its creators seemed desperate in their efforts to keep up with the puzzling new audience of the New Frontier: As a sop to the young, the composer of "White Christmas" and "There's No Business Like Show Business" was reduced to writing a song titled "The Washington Twist."
On more nights than I care to recall, I stood at the back of the auditorium, where the show's creators lined up in a row behind the rail along with the standees, watching how a packed house was responding to whatever inane plot twist had been written into the second act that afternoon. No matter what revisions were made, the only number that ever got a rise out of the audience was a song sung by the President's daughter lamenting her fiercely chaperoned love life ("The Secret Service makes me nervous/ And I can't").
One night at a gala performance heavily populated by Congressmen and the diplomatic corps, the fresh young actress playing the daughter, Anita Gillette, got out the first line of the song only to raise her hand, silence the band and abruptly squeal, "Oh, I forgot my words!" Given the exhausting hours of revision and rehearsal that preceded each night's performance, it was amazing she or anyone could perform at all. The audience ate up Ms. Gillette's attempts to jump-start "The Secret Service" as she repeatedly requested cues from Jay Blackton, the conductor. The mishap was, after all, the only spontaneous theatrical happening of the entire night.
But while the audience roared with laughter, the show's authors were not amused. Like horsemen of the apocalypse, Berlin, Lindsay, Crouse, Logan and Peter Gennaro, the choreographer, stood impassively in the shadows, their tired faces set in stone.
Well, it was only a show. A couple of weeks earlier, a chapter in Broadway history had been turned when "My Fair Lady" finally ended its then-record six-and-a-half-year run at its final home, the Broadway. A couple of weeks later, "Mr. President" would move to the St. James, a few blocks down the street, and take its lumps, then run through its unheard of $2.6 million advance sale (roughly $17 million at today's ticket prices) for eight months before closing, unmourned.
Berlin, Lindsay and Crouse never wrote another Broadway musical; Logan never had another hit. If you listen to the CD of "Mr. President," you'll hear why. But hindsight is easy. For a kid in the back of the house who was just discovering the theater, the travails of "Mr. President" seemed an exciting business. Only years later did I realize that what I had witnessed those nights in Washington was the quixotic last stand of show people whose long and illustrious day on Broadway had already passed.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Is That Really South Africa?

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
Maybe one day Hollywood will make a movie set in South Africa that features some of the following:
* An Afrikaner leader who repudiates apartheid. 
 * An upwardly mobile black entrepreneur.
* The tin-pot dictator of a designated black homeland.
* A migrant worker torn between his tribal upbringing and the citified ways of the township.
* The power-hungry wife of a black liberation leader.
Maybe, that is, Hollywood will make a movie populated with characters and textured with dilemmas South Africans themselves, black and white, would recognize. But for Hollywood, and perhaps for most Americans, South Africa is not a real place. It is a parable, in which ruthless white evil battles unmitigated black decency.
"Adolf Hitler versus the Cosby family" is the way Peter Wilhelm, a critic for the weekly Financial Mail, sums up Hollywood's portrayal of his country in a half dozen films that have appeared since mainstream directors discovered the dramatic potential of apartheid the mid-1980's.
"Bopha!," the directorial debut of the actor Morgan Freeman, is the latest Hollywood reflection on apartheid, and it pushes earnestly at the boundaries of South African stereotypes. In the film, based on Percy Mtwa's 1984 play about a black policeman and his rebellious son, the Cosby family is now dysfunctional. There is also a benign Afrikaner cop, though he knuckles under to the Nazi caricatures among his colleagues.
But like most of its predecessors, "Bopha!" is set on the barricades between good and evil. Whatever its merits may be as film (American reviewers have generally praised it since its opening late last month, while South Africans will not see it until next year), its South Africa is still more metaphor than country.
South Africa is hardly the only victim of Hollywood's tendency to see life in one easy dimension, but many South Africans say apartheid seems to satisfy a particular moral hunger among Americans -- a yearning for those clear choices on issues of race that America itself has not offered since the height of the civil rights movement. The complaint is not that Hollywood exaggerates the cruelty and humiliation of apartheid, which would be difficult to do, but that the movies are filled with glib judgments and the political statement usually overwhelms the story and the characters.
Blacks in these films, many South Africans complain, are as much cliches as whites. Either the black protagonist is an activist devoted to the struggle or a go-along-get-along fellow who, before the film is over, will discover the error of his indifference.
Often blacks are relegated to bit parts in their own struggle. Richard Attenborough's 1987 movie "Cry Freedom" is an example much maligned here. The movie starred Denzel Washington as Steve Biko, the black nationalist leader battered to death in police custody, and Kevin Kline as Donald Woods, the white journalist who befriended Mr. Biko and investigated his death. "Cry Freedom" was faulted by South Africans because Mr. Biko is killed off in mid-movie, whereupon it becomes a conventional escape melodrama starring the white reporter. (Denzel Washington's Oscar nomination was for best supporting actor.)
"There's got to be a white savior in the film," said Jerry Mofokeng, a theater director and drama teacher at the University of the Witswatersrand. "Steven Biko cannot be seen in his own light."
Mr. Mofokeng said it was symptomatic of foreign film makers' attitudes that an American star was cast in the Biko role rather than one of this country's accomplished black actors. "Our struggle is good business, but we cannot get bread out of it," he said. "We are only the symbols."
Another objection to "Cry Freedom" was that it homogenized black resistance into a single movement by having Mr. Biko pay homage to Nelson Mandela. Mr. Biko did admire Mr. Mandela, but Mr. Biko's Black Consciousness movement represented a sharp break from the nonracial doctrine of Mr. Mandela's African National Congress, and these starkly different philosophies divide blacks to this day. To many South Africans, fuzzing over the distinction was like equating Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.
A more egregious example of the white-centered South Africa movie was "The Power of One," a 1992 film about a white boy who endures the pain of discrimination because he speaks English rather than Afrikaans. Stirred by his own experience, the blond boy takes up boxing and becomes the symbolic avenger, battling the evil Afrikaners while helpless, worshipful blacks look on.
"It's a celebration of colonialism," said William Pretorius, who writes for The Weekly Mail and Guardian under the pseudonym Fabius Burger. "The whole idea is that the black doesn't think for himself, that it takes a white boy to teach him to think."
The one American movie many South Africans point to as accurately capturing their experiences is "A World Apart," the 1987 film based on the experiences of Shawn Slovo, the daughter of prominent Communists consumed by the anti-apartheid movement. Although the film focuses on a white family, it is filled with robust characters of both races and authentic relationships, including the anguished one between the teen-age daughter (Jodhi May) and the mother (Barbara Hershey) who puts struggle before family.
"Most American directors who come to work in South Africa have their imaginations paralyzed by apartheid, this institutionalized obscenity," said Barry Ronge, arts editor of The Sunday Times and perhaps South Africa's most influential white cultural arbiter. "The drama for them becomes the attack on apartheid." In contrast, he described "A World Apart" as "the only film of merit America has made about South Africa, because it got the emotional relationships right, and it didn't automatically designate sainthood."
Note that none of the enlightened whites in these movies -- Kevin Kline's journalist in "Cry Freedom," the boy in "The Power of One," the family in "A World Apart" -- is an Afrikaner, although in reality there were Afrikaners who fought apartheid with varying degrees of valor. The Afrikaner, in the Hollywood image, is either a fascist thug or an ostrich. If he is an ostrich, the viewer knows that the movie is going to be about some epiphany that forces him to pull his head from the sand and recognize the evil of the system on which his life is based. A viewer might fairly wonder how such a tribe produced an F. W. de Klerk, let alone allowed him to become president.
The quintessential ostrich, and the closest thing to a complex Afrikaner figure in Hollywood's limited repertory, is the protagonist played by Donald Sutherland in the 1989 film, "A Dry White Season." Mr. Sutherland portrays an earnest schoolteacher who inquires into the disappearance of his black gardener's son and soon finds himself under suspicion. The film is criticized by many South African blacks for implying that blacks need a white rescuer, and by many Afrikaners for failing to capture the cultural and historical ties of their community. The friends and relatives around Mr. Sutherland's character are so detestable, his decision to do the right thing seem easy.
Andre Brink, the Afrikaner novelist on whose book the movie was based, said he felt that, thanks to Mr. Sutherland's performance, the character and his dilemma were credible. But he was less happy with Hollywood's insistence on giving the movie a "Death Wish" ending, in which a villainous white security agent is gunned down by one of the blacks he has persecuted.
At showings he attended in England and France, Mr. Brink said the ending "detonated a sense of relief, a surge of enthusiasm and satisfaction that a blow was struck against the cops. But if one sits down to reflect on it, you don't end a system by killing a cop. It's just too glib and easy."
Although white heroes propel many Hollywood films that deal with South Africa, black characters stand squarely at the center of the two most recent.
"Sarafina!," a musical based on the 1976 black student uprising, was filmed in the streets of Soweto and employed many South African actors. Unusual among the commercial films on South Africa, it captures the township look -- down to telling details like the surprisingly spotless kitchens one finds inside the shabby homes of the township. But in adapting the stage musical (which ran for 597 performances on Broadway) for the screen, the writers piled on the political content, inserting dark, brutal scenes of massacre, torture and reprisal that overwhelmed the buoyant musical score, as if someone had tried to combine "Fame" and "Apocalypse Now."
To Thabiso Leshoai, a critic for South Africa's largest black newspaper, The Sowetan, "the idea of taking the whole student uprising and putting it in some Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers type format" was "in-your-face offensive." And Whoopi Goldberg, in the role of a Soweto schoolteacher, was cited as evidence that Americans who confront South Africa are immobilized by their reverence for the struggle.
"Whoopi, working in South Africa, lost her sass," said Mr. Ronge of The Sunday Times. "She doesn't dare do in a South Africa movie what she does all the time in American movies, to convey a sense of laughter and mockery."
"Bopha!" also seems to creak a bit with reverence for the struggle.
Danny Glover plays a black police sergeant devoted to the force, even though it requires him to enforce the demeaning rules of apartheid. In his blind loyalty to the system, he is a kind of township Archie Bunker. The son he blithely assumed would follow him into the police has secretly taken up with student rebels. This is the township version of the ostrich movie.
Mr. Freeman, the director, said in an interview that he did not choose the project. It was the only script offered for his directing debut. He conceded that he had no illusions about capturing the subtleties of South Africa. Rather, he said, he kept his eye on the family conflict, which he felt "could be placed just about anyplace." Although he visited South Africa to do casting and took a stroll through a township, the film was shot in Zimbabwe because, he said, the violence in South Africa made the insurance premiums too high for his budget.
Mr. Glover's warmth and a chilling reserve in Maynard Eziashi's performance as the son help confuse the viewer's loyalties for a while. But much as the graphic horrors depicted in "Sarafina!" overwhelmed the music, the same horrors in "Bopha!" make it hard to sympathize for long with a black character who defends the system. How thick this father must be, you wonder, to soldier on through the grisly torture of a student leader, the cold-blooded shooting of schoolchildren, the firebombing of his house by his neighbors, the heartfelt appeals of his wife to quit the force and the arrest of his son.
With a few digressions, the movie proceeds along a well-traveled route to the obvious resolution, which is bloody and ominous and gives no hint that a compromise is possible.
Percy Mtwa, who wrote the play on which "Bopha!" was based, said he had intended to write a statement about "the innocence of the general human race" and the need for mutual tolerance. Mr. Mtwa, himself the son of a township policeman, had not yet seen the movie, but he was sent drafts of the screenplay for review and comment. With each draft, he recalled recently during a conversation in his apartment in Cape Town, he grew more concerned that the American writers were laying on the violence and losing the innocence.
"The play does not castigate the policeman, although there were policemen who were bad," he said. "Part of the message was that even in a free society we will need policemen."
The limitations of the celluloid South Africa are all the more conspicuous now that the real South Africa has fashioned its barricades into negotiating tables. The white Government entered into secret talks with the imprisoned Nelson Mandela in July 1986, and Mr. Mandela has since been freed and apartheid officially disavowed. Yet little in the Hollywood films hints at the negotiated settlement now nearly complete or suggests that South Africa might overcome apartheid except by violent upheaval. Nor is there much that suggests the profound problems of economic reckoning, class conflict, tribal friction and politicized lawlessness that threaten a new government after apartheid is gone.
With the apartheid bogyman gone, Hollywood has begun using South African locations and actors in films -- a forthcoming comedy about basketball, "The Air Up There," for instance -- in which South Africa is the setting, not the subject. South Africans say that is just as well.
"I don't expect Hollywood can give us a film on South Africa with any insight," said Thabiso Leshoai of The Sowetan. "That requires a new sensitivity of some sort, and it will come from South African film makers, especially the new, young black film makers."
Barry Ronge agreed. "That's true," he said. "What would be wonderful is if they could have an American budget to do it with."

A Landmark Manages to Cheat The Wrecking Ball

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO BE SAID of Los Angeles in the last decade, it is that it has become consistently and continuously more citylike, in both the good and bad senses of that word. It is a more urban place than it once was, denser and tenser and busier than ever. Its citizens are less inclined to fool themselves into believing that escape brings freedom from the woes that afflict other cities, less willing to pretend that Los Angeles is as different from other cities as they once thought.
It's against this background of growing urban consciousness that the city's decision to spend $214 million on a library in the middle of its downtown has to be viewed. This library is not only a place of books but a statement about urbanism, a statement about Los Angeles's increasing willingness to let itself be like other, older cities. Designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, a New York and Los Angeles firm with what could be called a highly urban sensibility, the project almost didn't happen at all. That it not only got built but turned out as well as it did is a triumphant moment for both the city's architecture and its history. 
 The building's saga is a story of politics, economics, sociology and symbolism; architecture would seem almost to be the least of it, though in the end it may be the thing that brings the most pleasure. For this is more than an excellent new building; it is also a magnificently restored older one. The real beginning of the story is not in 1983, when Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer was hired, but back in the 1920's, when the city of Los Angeles, eager for a sign that it had reached urban maturity, commissioned the New York architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue to design a large central library on a prominent downtown site. Goodhue produced a magnificent mix of Spanish colonial, Byzantine and Art Moderne architecture that quickly became a landmark, the Los Angeles equivalent of the great libraries of New York and Boston.
All was well until the 1970's, when the Goodhue building's age and limited size led to cries for its replacement. Preservationists, who correctly saw the building as a masterwork by one of the 20th century's important architects, fought fiercely with librarians, who wanted more space and efficiency; both groups were pitted against politicians, who questioned whether a sprawling city like Los Angeles needed a central library at all. Why not scatter the collection throughout the city, they asked, on the rationale that pro-
library voters lived in residential neighborhoods, not downtown office towers. Making the same argument, but for an altogether different reason, were the celebrants of technology, who thought that computer terminals everywhere were the way to bring Los Angeles into the new era of library science.
The city debated for years but finally resolved the issue in the right way, by deciding to save the Goodhue library, restore it and expand it. In 1986 a devastating fire in the Goodhue building set the effort back and stretched out the timetable to a full decade from the hiring of the architect to the cutting of the ribbon last week.
The results are worth it. The Goodhue building has been exquisitely restored, and joined to a large new structure beside it that now contains most of the library's stacks and reading rooms. While the two sections do not flow together seamlessly either inside or out -- we always know whether we are in the new or the old wing, which is as it should be -- the Goodhue and Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer buildings sit together comfortably, even amicably. It's no small accomplishment, since the Goodhue building was designed to stand entirely alone: with a floor plan shaped like a cross, four major entrances and a brilliantly colored pyramidal tower as a central exclamation point, this is not a building that wants any competition.
Norman Pfeiffer, the architect in charge of the project, has managed to create an addition that both defers to Goodhue and stands strongly on its own. The new structure is slightly whimsical, slightly institutional, its style a kind of decorated industrial modernism that picks up on the Art Moderne leanings of the Goodhue building. It is covered in a combination of adobe-colored stucco and green terra cotta, and its carefully sculptured setbacks mount upward in a way that relates to the shape of the Goodhue building without directly imitating it.
The addition is anchored by an eight-story atrium, roughly half of which is set below ground to keep the profile of the new building low and allow the tower of the original building to keep pride of place on the skyline. The atrium is full of natural light, and it has no feeling of being underground; escalators tumble down through the space like a waterfall. On both sides of the atrium at each level are reading rooms and stacks, decorated in Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer's characteristic mix of funkiness, retro-chic and industrial modernism.
The rooms are comfortable and inviting. None of the spaces in the new wing come up to Goodhue's best, however, which stands as a reminder of how unthinkable it would have been to lose the old building, truly one of the treasures of American architecture. The central rotunda, still the emotional if no longer the functional heart of the building, is handsomely restored as a ceremonial hall, while the original reading rooms, with their lush murals and extraordinary stenciling, have been converted into the new children's department. That decision makes a glorious statement: What better way to introduce children to the pleasures of both reading and architecture?
But this whole complex is likely to do that for everyone in Los Angeles. The building is a central symbol for a city that has so few of them, for a city that has often had to concede that freeways are its logo. Is such a library an anachronism in an age of computers and faxes, an age that deals in "information retrieval" more than book collecting?
It may be that we need this sort of library more than ever, in Los Angeles and everywhere else. This library is a research center, but it is also a community center where knowledge is the lure, a place where the people of this increasingly multi-ethnic city can meet on common ground. It reminds us that sprawling out forever doesn't work -- that Los Angeles cannot think of itself as 474 square miles and growing, that it must turn back inward if it is to survive. And in a city of private realms, this project celebrates what Los Angeles needs most of all: the public realm.

HEADLINE: IF PRODUCTIVITY'S RISING, WHY ARE JOBS PAYING LESS?

 BODY:
Steven Rattner is excessively cavalier about the people who lose their jobs during what he describes as productivity upturns; more important, he offers no evidence that new jobs will actually result from the current upturn ("If Productivity's Rising, Why Are Jobs Paying Less?" Sept. 19).
To top it off, his nostrums include the same ones that are always offered by the business community: tax incentives (for industry, naturally, not the job seekers), deficit reduction and less Government interference in private enterprise. And as might be expected, Rattner vetoes Government policy that would actually create jobs, whether through public works or "industrial policy." 
 I notice that the author is a general partner of Lazard Freres and thus in no danger of being made jobless by a productivity upturn in his workplace. Still, his lack of concern about today's jobless is no worse than that of many economists and other academics who have lifetime job tenure. I often wonder what they would recommend for the economy if they suddenly joined the ranks of the downsized.

HEADLINE: IF PRODUCTIVITY'S RISING, WHY ARE JOBS PAYING LESS?

 BODY:
The fly in Rattner's pro-growth ointment is that "efficient" corporations may be firing the consumers who once bought their products. If enough high-wage jobs are replaced by low-wage jobs, who will be left to buy the stream of goods turned out by "productive" industries? It's a legitimate question one need not be a Luddite to ask. 
 Notwithstanding Ratt-ner's assurances, crises brought on by overcapacity have sometimes been ended only by a political intervention that shored up the purchasing power of a decaying middle. The Great Depression did not yield to pro-market exhortations. It was ended by Government spending in World War II and by the efforts of unions to turn the subsistence wages of an industrial working class into the substantial wages that created an American middle class.

Discovering Lower East Side

 BODY:
A colorful map and fold-out brochure that serves as a guide to more than 25 cultural and historic attractions on the Lower East Side of Manhattan has been published by the Lower East Side Consortium, an economic development group.
Titled "Discover Five Treasures on the Lower East Side," it gives detailed information about Little Italy, Chinatown, the area around Orchard and Delancey Streets, the East Village and the East Village area east of Avenue B called Loisaida by its largely Hispanic population from the Spanish pronunciation of Lower East Side. Each neighborhood is represented with sections labeled "Discover the History," "Discover the Cultures" and "Discover the Sights." 
 The brochure is available free by mail only from the Lower East Side Consortium, 110 William Street, Third Floor, New York, N.Y. 10038. Enclose a long business envelope with 29 cents' postage.
Two groups that run guided walks of the Lower East Side are Big Onion Walking Tours and the Eldridge Street Project.
Big Onion Walking Tours, Columbia University Post Office, Post Office Box 250201, New York, N.Y. 10025, telephone (212) 439-1090, conducts walks throughout the year. Tours last from two to two and a half hours, and cost $9. "Irish New York" will be the subject of a tour on Oct. 23 and the "Jewish East Side" on Nov. 7.
The Eldridge Street Project, 12 Eldrige Street, New York, N.Y. 10002, (212) 219-0888, was founded in 1986 to restore the Eldridge Street synagogue and make it a heritage center on the Lower East Side. It runs tours throughout the year under such titles as "The Synagogues of the Lower East Side" and "Pickles, Rugelach, Bialys and Knishes," both of which cost $10 a person.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property:/Upper Broadway;
The Glitter of the Other Broadway

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
FOR years they've flocked to Zabar's for their lox, to H & H for their bagels, to Fairway for their fruits and vegetables. They are a motley lot, with well-coiffed women in minks jostling ponytailed men in cutoffs for counter space; some have their bags of goodies loaded into limousines, others tie them to bicycle racks, still others hail cabs -- and many, many more just walk home.
These are the Broadway shoppers, people from all careers, all classes, all races, who hate to waste money but are willing to spend whatever it takes for quality. They have been around for decades. And now a new wave of retailers, including some national chains, are recognizing them as one of the most potentially lucrative customer groups around. 
 "It seems like every retail tenant we represent has a standard requirement with us, to get them on Broadway," said Benjamin Fox, an executive vice president of New Spectrum Realty Services. "Dollar for dollar, it is the best retail street in the city."
In the last two or three years there has been an explosion of retail leasing activity on Broadway north of Columbus Circle. Barnes & Noble, Cosmetics Plus, the Gap, Talbots and a host of other Manhattan mainstays have either opened or are about to open new stores in the area, many of them much larger than their stores elsewhere in the city.
Filene's Basement, a newcomer to New York, chose Broadway and 79th Street for its flagship store. Even Broadway in the West 90's, long considered a bit too seedy for many retailers' tastes, is enjoying a renaissance, with a new Vitamin Corner between 94th and 95th, a Lechter's Housewares near 94th Street and a Gap Kids near 96th.
"Retailers are like sheep; they want to follow wherever the others go," said Faith H. Consolo, a managing director at Garrick-Aug, the store-leasing specialists. "And in the last six to eight months everyone has been going to Broadway."
If current projects continue as planned, Broadway will become even more of a shopper's -- and thus, a seller's -- haven. The Kmart Corporation has expressed interest in the Coliseum, that much-discussed building expected to bring hundreds of new residents for its 38 floors of apartments, but also a 10-screen movie theater, a Gap, another Barnes & Noble superstore, a sports center, even an Armani A.X.
"This area is dynamite," said Edward A. Friedman, president of Newmark Retail Services. "It's a small area with an unbelievably dense population, and anyone who is thinking of coming into New York now is looking at Broadway."
OF course, much of this revolves around economics. Broadway above Columbus Circle has always been an established shopping corridor, catering more to residents than to tourists or office workers, and its retailers did not suffer nearly as much in this recession as did their midtown counterparts, who need to draw customers from office buildings with persistently high vacancy levels.
Still, in keeping with the general recession, Broadway rents have gone down. Decent storefront space on upper Broadway that went for annual rents of $100 a square foot or more a couple of years ago is now $65 to $80, although a good corner spot can still command $100 or better.
That's one reason that the 9 West Group, which operates several upscale women's shoe stores in tonier parts of Manhattan, is about to open on Broadway near 83d Street.
"No, we're not projecting the same volume that we get on Lexington or Madison, but then, we're not paying a Madison Avenue rent," said Joel Fisher, senior vice president of real estate and store planning for the 9 West Group. "And we've visited this street a lot in the last few years, and we like the traffic that we've seen."
The rent drop has encouraged some retailers to take larger spaces than they normally would. Cosmetics Plus is moving into 4,500 square feet -- nearly double its usual store size -- that the Marine Midland Bank had occupied near 75th Street. The chain will use the extra space to put in a beauty service and create what Ms. Consolo, who brokered the deal, calls a "spa-like" atmosphere.
"We made a great sublet deal with the bank, so this was a chance to build a really high-impact store," Ms. Consolo said.
People willing to take basement or upstairs space, particularly on the east -- for that, read non-Zabar's -- side of the street, can do even better. Jennifer Leathers, part of the Jennifer Convertibles chain, took a total of 5,700 feet at 2300 Broadway, near 83d Street, 4,500 square feet of which was basement. It is using both levels to sell, yet because basement space is so much cheaper -- and because the east side of Broadway has traditionally generated less pedestrian traffic and thus commands lower rents -- its average rent for the entire space is less than $40 a square foot.
Similarly, Preferred Seating, which has for many years operated a successful furniture store across from ABC Carpet on Broadway near 18th Street, opened a couple of years ago in about 4,000 square feet of second-floor space near 85th Street, for a rent in the low $20's. It is using a big awning on its entrance and a huge neon sign in its windows to herald its presence.
"We'd been looking at upper Broadway for several years, but until this space opened up we couldn't find anything that fit our rent parameters," said Robert Villency, chairman of Maurice Villency, which owns Preferred Seating. "Preferred Seating operates on razor-thin margins and we simply couldn't pay the rent that a Maurice Villency store pays."
But not all the retail newcomers have been bargain hunters. Brokers say that Cooper's Coffee Bar paid well above market rates for its new cafe on Broadway and 75th Street. Whole Foods, which runs a successful health foods store in SoHo, recently opened a 2,300-square-foot store on 89th Street and Broadway. No one is talking numbers, but the word among brokers is that Charles Rosenbloom, the store's owner, also agreed to above-market prices on his 15-year lease.
"Yes, he's paying a hefty rent, but look at what he got," said New Spectrum's Mr. Fox, who negotiated for Whole Foods. "He got a corner store, terrific frontage, and most important, he's convenient to the loyal West Side customer."
Indeed, any number of the long-time retailers in the area speak of customer loyalty as one of the boons of being on upper Broadway. Varizioni, a high-priced women's clothing shop on the west side of Broadway near 82d Street, has one year left on its 10-year lease. It stocks a huge assortment of hats and long-sleeved items, and that has garnered it a lot of repeat business from the neighborhood's large contingent of Orthodox Jewish women.
Although Varizioni's owners would love to see the whole neighborhood go a bit more upscale -- "We wish Barneys would be coming in across the street instead of Filene's," said Manoucher Hedvat, one of the owners -- they fully intend to renew their lease.
Similarly, Harry's Shoes, a family shoe store on the southwest corner of 83d Street and Broadway, has been there for about 18 years. "Sure, Barnes & Noble has drawn traffic, and Filene's will draw more, but even before them we have never wanted to move elsewhere," said Joseph Goldberg, one of the owners, who says that 70 percent of his customers are from the neighborhood.
That neighborhood orientation has been the saving grace of the Broadway retailers. Retailers on Columbus Avenue, once thought to be the West Side's equivalent to Madison Avenue, have not done as uniformly well. "Columbus is a weekend strolling street, and one that suffered mightily from the demise of the yuppies," said Ms. Consolo. "Broadway is an everyday street that caters to residents of all incomes."
UPPER BROADWAY is, in fact, really four different shopping neighborhoods: the 60's, the 70's, the 80's and the 90's. The southern tip, which encompasses Lincoln Center and many of the newer high-rises, is probably the toniest part, and the one most visited by tourists. It is less homey, more expensive, more attractive to chains and restaurants than to the proverbial butcher, baker and candlestick maker.
North of 72d Street the neighborhood becomes almost purely residential, and neighborhood service stores peacefully coexist with clothing stores, electronics stores and the like. The neighborhood's gentrification has marched slowly but steadily north from Columbus Circle, and the farther north one goes, the larger the proportion of poorer residents. A store like Armani A.X., which is opening in the Lincoln Square complex, would probably not have a chance were it to open 25 blocks north.
Gentrification slows dramatically at 96th Street. Between there and Columbia University, about a mile north, Broadway remains a hodgepodge of bargain stores, older supermarkets and groceries and other long-time retail residents.
Each of the 10-block neighborhoods is so densely populated that it is a mini-city unto itself. Each has its own supermarkets, its own clothing stores, its own bookstores. Few West Side residents venture out of their own neighborhoods to shop, except tor high-powered traffic pullers like Zabar's or Barnes & Noble. Mr. Villency, for one, did not even consider putting a Maurice Villency store, which sells very high-end furniture, in the Preferred Seating locale.
"Maurice Villency needs to draw people from a radius of 20 miles to get 90 percent of its business," Mr. Villency said. Indeed, Mr. Villency says that the Maurice Villency store on 35th Street and Madison Avenue more than covers the company's customer base in the borough. "One Maurice Villency store in Manhattan is enough," he said.
But for retailers with popularly priced items, Broadway's segmentation has a definite upside. The street can support numerous stores from the same chain, with none of the stores cannibalizing each other. The Gap already has four stores between 59th and 96th and is looking to put another in Lincoln Square. It is seeking more sites for Gap Kids stores as well, and its Banana Republic store on 87th Street has done so well that it is moving into the much larger space that the East New York Bank occupied a block south, on the northeast corner of 86th Street.
In fact, from 72d Street through 82d Street, the east and west sides of Broadway are worlds apart. On the west side, Fairway, Zabar's and lately, Barnes & Noble, act as magnets, drawing people north for half a mile. The east side, by comparison, is a ghost town.
"From 70th to 80th, pedestrian traffic on the west side of Broadway is 20 times that on the east," New Spectrum's Mr. Fox estimated. That may, of course, change when Filene's Basement opens on Broadway's east side, but for now, the dichotomy between the west side haves and the east side have-nots is clear.
It has been for years. James Bildner can tell you that. In 1987 he opened a J. Bildner's & Sons, a Massachussetts-based chain of high-priced perishable foods, on the northeast corner of 74th Street and Broadway, right across from Fairway. He paid a high rent -- some brokers guess it was in excess of $150 a foot -- but he was certain that a neighborhood that could support a Zabar's could easily support him.
He was wrong. The store closed barely nine months later.
"WE just didn't understand the difference between the west side and east side of the street," Mr. Bildner recalls. "Our intent was to be parasitic on the traffic heading for Zabar's or Fairway, but the fact is they never walked by us." That experience, combined with problems finding employees who could give the type of service that Bildner's offers to justify its prices, has pretty well soured Mr. Bildner on trying New York again any time soon.
But while a poor site can mean a death knell, even the best site in town doesn't guarantee success. The Muffin Lady, a diet food chain that has done terrifically on Long Island, opened a 1,000-foot store right next to Zabar's a couple of years ago. The store lasted barely a year; its products were costly, and West Siders balked at paying for them.
Koo Koo Roo, on the northwest corner of 76th Street, was similarly short-lived. The idea -- skinless broiled chicken -- fit in with the West Side's health consciousness, but neither the product itself nor the restaurant's fast-food ambiance wooed repeat business.
"The preponderance of people shopping the West Side are successful but not rich," said Newmark's Mr. Friedman. "They are price-conscious and value-conscious. And that means this will always be an area where strong retailers will survive and prosper. Marginal retailers will simply fail."

HEADLINE: After Weicker, New Candidates, New Strategies

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
AS a politician, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has conducted his affairs rather like one of the opera stars he so admires: larger than life, full of grand passions, and capable at any moment of springing an improbable plot twist on his audience.
The election campaign that has now begun, following Mr. Weicker's decision to leave the stage after one term, promises to be on a more human scale, for better and worse. 
 The half-dozen or so candidates and would-be candidates whose names are now in play for the 1994 governor's race will face no sitting incumbent with Mr. Weicker out, a fact that by itself would tend to level the field. And party officials say that perhaps partly in reaction to the sometimes grand guignol effects of the Weicker years, the script for all the candidates will likely stay close to the basic messages as well -- issues like jobs, the economy and health care. The result may still be exciting but it will not be Aida. "This time there aren't going to be any dominant personalities," said John G. Rowland, who was the Republican Party's candidate in 1990 and who is widely expected to run again in 1994. "This time the issues are so significant -- the job market, the economy, the future, the income tax, education, crime -- that the campaign is going to go beyond particular personality, it's going to get into pure gut policies."
Other politicians say that Mr. Weicker's large shadow will still hang over the race, if only by the indelible image that he carries in many voters' minds and the inevitable comparisons that will be made.
And who knows what the best answer is, anyway? When stacked up against a politician of Mr. Weicker's stature -- first third-party governor in a century, father of the state income tax, veteran of the Watergate Committee -- does a more life-size candidate end up looking small by comparison, or refreshingly down to earth? Is it better to run with a hint of the self-assured Weicker swagger, or to step forward more humbly as a candidate who would transcend problems rather than charge them like a bull?
 
The Grand Moment or Day to Day?
 "This is an administration that favored the grand moment -- desegregation, casino gambling, the income tax -- sometimes, I would argue, at the expense of the day-to-dayness of things," said the State Comptroller, William E. Curry Jr., a Democrat who said last week that he was close to a decision to run. Under Mr. Weicker, Mr. Curry said, there were moments of high moral purpose and conscience, "but the basic systems of government have continued to run down and need attention."
Among those in the race or considering a bid, three worked directly with or in some instances against Mr. Weicker in Hartford: Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, running on the ticket of A Connecticut Party, and State Senators John B. Larson of East Hartford and Richard J. Balducci of Newington, both Democrats.
Four others, plus Mr. Rowland, are on the early lists as well: Mr. Curry, the Comptroller; United States Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican from New Britain; Joel Schiavone, a New Haven businessman and a Republican who ran for Comptroller in 1990, and the Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer of Plainville, also a Republican.
 
Reinventing Compelling Figures
 Party leaders and candidates stress that with the election still 13 months away, all prognostications about the final shape of the campaign are mere guesses, but that some early lead lines are emerging about how the players will attempt to connect with voters, make themselves known and in some cases reinvent themselves as compelling figures who deserve votes. In general, they say, two related questions are expected to be paramount.
No. 1: Who gets credit or blame for the state of the economy on Election Day? and No. 2: Has the allure of third-party politics worn off?
On the first point, battle lines have already been drawn. Senator Larson, who entered the race this spring in anticipation of a campaign against Mr. Weicker, had already formulated a blistering critique of the state's Department of Economic Development, which Mr. Larson says has blundered clue-less and plan-less, with a "scattershot approach," that has distributed hundreds of millions of dollars in grants and loans to companies without getting any measure of whether jobs were actually being created.
 
No More 'Money Store'
 "We can't continue to be the Connecticut Money Store," Mr. Larson said. "We can't continue to act as though we're Phil Rizzuto."
Facing off on that front, based on her early comments, will be Mrs. Groark, who entered the campaign on Tuesday and pledged to continue Mr. Weicker's policies -- and his economic development programs in particular.
"Our decisions are keeping the businesses here, and most importantly, keeping paychecks in the hands of the citizens of the state of Connecticut," she said. "Connecticut can only continue to move forward," she added, under "a governor committed to continuing the course that we have set in this administration, not dismantling our reforms and retreating to the problems of the past."
 
Holding a Coalition
 The second question centers even more directly on Mrs. Groark. Can she hold together the coalition of disaffected Democrats and liberal Republicans who elected Mr. Weicker? And if she does not win, which of the other two major parties does her candidacy help or hurt?
Mrs. Groark, like Mr. Weicker, is a former Republican, but unlike Mr. Weicker she has no track record of attracting Democratic votes except at Mr. Weicker's side in the 1990 election. And neither Democrat nor Republican party leaders have been kind so far in assessing her chances of following up where Mr. Weicker left off. A Connecticut Party, which she represents, has only about 1,800 members statewide, or less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the statewide voter registration total of 1.95 million. And she is not widely known outside the Hartford area.
"Eunice's run is just some kind of blind loyalty to Lowell," said Mr. Rowland. "The ultimate loyalty of the captain going down with the ship."
The chairman of the Democratic Party, Edward L. Marcus, was similarly dismissive. "I consider Eunice to be a nice person and a credible candidate, but I wouldn't categorize her as a formidable candidate," he said.
 
Power Potential of Office
 But those early assessments also do not reckon with the potential power of her office and exposure that Mr. Weicker could bestow by simply stepping a little more out of the spotlight and allowing Mrs. Groark to the front and center over the next year.
To one degree or another, all the candidates face problems of either not being widely known, or like Mr. Rowland, having been out of government and out of the spotlight entirely for three long years since the last election. And making voters' acquaintance, or reacquaintance, is expensive, especially in places like Fairfield County, where many people are only considered reachable -- for television advertising, at least -- through time purchased on New York stations with their huge audiences and high rates.
In his 1990 race against Mr. Weicker and Bruce A. Morrison (the Democratic candidate), Mr. Rowland (then a Congressman from the district around Waterbury) spent nearly one-third of his entire campaign fund buying New York advertising. And he did well there, beating Mr. Weicker across most of the county. But he still lost by three percentage points in the statewide count.
"The less you are known, the more you have to spend to become known," said the state Republican Party chairman, John A. Mastropietro. "But name recognition is also an overplayed commodity," he added. "Early on, certainly, it is important, but it is not something that you cannot overcome."

Making Gold-Coast Affordable Housing a Reality

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
DECADE after decade, Fairfield County's wealthier towns have talked about affordable housing, but as a subject for action it has been as intractable as the weather. Barely noting state guidelines suggesting that a minimum of 10 percent of housing be in the "affordable" category -- which means $100,000 for a family of four in Fairfield County earning $40,000 a year -- most communities remain at about 2 percent. Only the larger cities of Bridgeport and Stamford exceed the minimum.
Nevertheless, 126 units of new or renovated affordable housing have been produced around the county by the Fairfield 2000 Homes Corporation, a group of volunteer movers and shakers founded in 1987. 
 The 18-member privately financed nonprofit organization is a spinoff of the Regional Plan Association; its chairman is Bruce Warwick, a Stamford developer. The group is currently shepherding dozens more units from drawing board to reality.
"Fairfield 2000 is successful because it takes a middle-of-the-road approach," said Rick Redniss of Parsons, Bromfield, Redniss & Mead, a Stamford land-use planning firm that has written zoning laws allowing the corporation to bring its projects to fruition. "They target the municipal employees and low-income town residents who are traditionally left out, the very people that the communities say they want to help."
While the units are open to anyone, priority is given to townspeople.
Waterside Green, in an industrial neighborhood in south Stamford, was the corporation's first venture. It opened 16 months ago and the last of 75 units was bought and occupied last month. The complex was designed by Zane Yost, a Bridgeport architect with strong convictions that low-cost housing should be stylish, well-built and contain communal open space.
Jose Quinones, a shipping supervisor for Perkin-Elmer in Wilton, his wife, Caroline, and their two young daughters moved in a year ago.
"We paid $109,000, with $3,175 down," Mrs. Quinones said. Their monthly mortgage, taxes and insurance cost $950, exactly what they paid for a two-bedroom apartment in Stamford that was "so small we had to keep our stuff in boxes," she added. Now they have three bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a living room, dining room, fully equipped kitchen, fenced patio and central air-conditioning.
One-bedroom units start at $63,500 and common charges range from $60 to $90 a month.
Mr. Yost also designed a 30-unit complex that is expected to get municipal approval in Darien by the end of the year. Resistance to such housing had generated prolonged litigation until the town asked for a proposal from Fairfield 2000 last year.
The group's latest venture in Stamford is the proposed conversion of 300 Broad Street, an office building it has under contract, into 69 apartments expected to sell for $25,000 to $35,000. The city is considering using its allocation of $1.8 million from the Federal Housing and Urban Development Department to finance up to $15,000 of renovations for each unit, said Timothy Beeble, director of the Stamford Community Development Agency.
Designed as an apartment house in 1971, the nine-story building was switched to offices in an attempt to cash in on the market. When the recession hit and most of its tenants left, the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company became the owner by foreclosure. "The asking price is $1.5 million," said James Fagan, broker with CB Commercial. "In 1986, it sold for $8 million."
While there is no rush to turn empty office buildings into apartments, Mr. Redniss said there were some buildings on Summer Street that would be adaptable.
"This does reduce the office vacancy rate and addresses a type of housing for which some companies moved elsewhere," he said.
Summer Street, which runs north from downtown Stamford, contains a mix of old and new buildings.
FAIRFIELD 2000's foray into Westport involved taking over Wassell Lane, a one-block development of 16 similar cottages built in the 50's by the Federal Government. Just south of the Merritt Parkway off Main Street, they once housed Army personnel who worked at nearby sites.
With the Army long gone, the Government put the cottages up for sale in 1990. Working with Fairfield 2000, Westport acquired them with a state grant of $672,000.
"Because the houses had been there and created no negative situation, nobody objected to recycling them for low-income people," said Catherine Barnard, Westport's planning director. "We rezoned for quarter-acre lots and got the necessary setback variances."
The one-story, three-bedroom, one-bathroom houses were refurbished and new septic systems were installed under grandfathered zoning. Three homes were set aside for use by homeless women with children for periods of a year.
The rest of the units, some with garages, were advertised and sold for $88,750 to $99,750 in the last few months. They were assigned by lottery to applicants with jobs who qualified as first-time buyers. Income limits set for Fairfield County by the state Housing Department range from a minimum of $27,900 for a single person to a maximum of $62,200 for a family of six. Units may be resold only to similarly qualified buyers, and appreciation is limited to 5 percent a year beginning at the third year.
AMONG the new owners is Joseph DeMattio, a young mechanic who grew up in Westport.
"I always hoped to buy a house, but prices got so inflated it was impossible," he said.
Like the Quinoneses, he will pay the same amount for mortgage, taxes and insurance each month, around $700, as he did for rent in Norwalk, but he has a three-bedroom house and will be reunited with friends who also bought homes in Wassell Lane.
George Davon, a Danbury developer, contacted Fairfield 2000 for help in getting qualified buyers under Federal Housing Administration and Connecticut Housing Finance Authority programs for Liberty Terrace, his 35-unit complex in Danbury's downtown renewal area. He financed the $3 million project independently and since breaking ground last December he has sold 24 of the 25 completed units.
The two-bedroom, one- and two-story homes, some with terraces, are fully equipped and carpeted. They are priced at $78,900 and $98,900.
"As long as the market stays as tight as it is," Mr. Davon said, "developers will work in affordable housing. And those who do so need to team up with a nonprofit partner. Otherwise, many doors to financing and the market place are closed to them."

New Start for a Troubled Building

 BODY:
Finally, the end of a painful odyssey for a troubled building: Last week the ownership of the 52-story, 3.6 million-square-foot 55 Water Street was formally transferred from Olympia & York to the New Water Street Corporation, the majority of which is owned by the Retirement Systems of Alabama. And now the more pleasant journey begins: taking the once-debt-laden building from run-down property to modern corporate center.
It won't be a quick trip or a cheap one. It will cost well over $20 million to remove asbestos. The new owners plan to install a back-up electrical system to end, once and for all, the electricity outages that have plagued the building. And they've just hired the architects Kohn Pedersen Fox to come up with an extensive cosmetic remodeling plan as well. 
 The building, which is now free of debt, has time on its side. It is 65 percent occupied, with few leases rolling over before 1997. The new owners do not plan a major marketing push until most of the renovations are complete. "We want to show prospective tenants results, not just give them promises," said David G. Bronner, the Retirement Systems of Alabama's chief executive officer.
Dr. Bronner seems undaunted by what many would see as a huge gamble on a recession-ravaged section of New York. "We have great faith in the prospects of downtown Manhattan," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Emboldens Advocates of More Pacific Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVEN as it struggles to gain Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Clinton Administration is casting its eyes across the Pacific.
It envisions a gradual dismantling of trade barriers between the United States and Pacific nations and perhaps someday a free trade area similar to that of Nafta. A Pacific free trade area could bring even more rewards to the American economy than some people expect from Nafta, but might be an even harder sell domestically. 
 For the moment, Administration officials say, the vehicle for integrating the United States with the fast-growing economies across the Pacific is the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC. While the 4-year-old organization is little known outside a rarefied group of policy makers and business executives, it could gain a wider following when President Clinton hosts a summit conference next month in Seattle attended by the heads of 14 of the 15 APEC countries.
In their dreamier moments, supporters of APEC inside and outside the Administration foresee a gigantic free trade zone that encompasses East Asia, Australia and parts of the Western Hemisphere, an entity with more than enough economic muscle to help set world trade policy.
Indeed, interest in the region is the same as Willie Sutton's for picking banks to rob: It's where the money is. "This is the dynamic area of the world economy," said C. Fred Bergsten, an economist who heads the Institute for International Economics in Washington and a consultant for APEC. "Europe's dead in the water. Latin America's improving, but still has a lot of problems."
If the idea of a Pacific Rim trading bloc gains momentum, some countries left out might decide to push harder to complete trade talks under way among 116 countries. Those talks are aimed at lowering tariffs and expanding the free trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to cover services and agriculture for the first time.
Fifteen countries comprise APEC: Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Together they contain 40 percent of the world's population and have a combined gross domestic product of $13 trillion. Last year, the United States did $344 billion in merchandise trade with countries across the Pacific, far above its $265 billion in trade with Canada and Mexico and its $228 billion with Western Europe, according to the Commerce Department.
"Even today there are about 2.5 million jobs in the U.S. that are dependent on Asian trade, and that does not include Canada," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. "As you look at APEC nations you see tremendous potential for growth in that trade."
Yet the euphoria that surrounds discussions of APEC is punctured by some hard-edged questions. Can APEC evolve into anything more than a group of countries that does little more than talk about trade liberalization? Will the protectionist forces giving the Administration fits over Nafta allow free trade with Asian countries which are much tougher competitors than Mexico? Can the United States work alongside countries with which it is often at odds over issues like human rights and weapons proliferation.
Some proponents worry that pushing the group to do too much too fast could shatter its consensus. "It's a baby, it's a child," said William Bodde Jr., executive director of APEC's secretariat, in Singapore. "If you load it down with too much baggage, it will never grow up."
APEC adherents hope the group will gain from the meeting hosted by President Clinton in Seattle on Nov. 19-20. "What we'd like to see coming out of Seattle is a reinforcement from the leaders that APEC makes sense," said Donald Russell, Australia's Ambassador to the United States.
At the meeting, the first ever held just with a large group of Pacific Rim nations, the leaders are expected to ratify an agreement to work toward a code that will govern private investments in member countries.
In addition, the leaders are expected to endorse a statement of principles on other issues, including harmonization of standards for products and service. For example, certification by one APEC member that a product is safe would be accepted by all members.
The leaders will also discuss accepting Mexico, Chile and Papua New Guinea as members.
But if APEC could someday be an economic Godzilla, it currently seemslike an uncertain college sophomore: It doesn't know what it wants to be. While all the countries want to liberalize trade, there are differences on how fast -- and even whether -- APEC should be transformed into a formal body that negotiates tariff reductions or settles disputes.
Some countries, including the United States, Canada, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, are pressing APEC to move faster toward becoming a formalized body with some teeth. But they acknowledge that making APEC into something resembling GATT or the European Community could take 10 to 20 years.
At the other extreme, some members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, particularly Malaysia, worry that larger economies, especially those of the United States and Japan, will use the organization to dominate the region. Indeed, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, is boycotting the Seattle meeting.
To find a coherent strategy, the organization set up a group of economists, former Cabinet officials and academics headed by Mr. Bergsten. Mr. Bergsten said he wanted to move APEC toward concrete accomplishments, including a dispute-resolution mechanism.
His group will present a report in Seattle that will call for the establishment of an investment code that will assure private investors that their capital will be protected and that earnings can be repatriated.
Given the nebulous nature of APEC, some economists said the Clinton Administration should not place too much emphasis on the group, at the expense of bilateral talks with nations like Japan and China. "I just don't think a great nation like the United States should be relying on what is really a group that is not ready to take on the needed task of doing more than talking about trade liberalization," said Paula Stern, an economist in Washington.
Hovering over the talk of a Pacific trade zone is concern over the fate of Nafta. Many Pacific Rim leaders worry that a defeat of Nafta would empower protectionist forces in the United States, who would resist free trade across the Pacific.
Whether or not APEC becomes something more concrete, some say they think it is already having some impact. They say fear of a regional trade bloc might make some countries, most notably France, show more flexibility in the current GATT negotiations. Said Lawrence Krause, a professor of economics at the University of California at San Diego's Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies: "If you're the French, and believe that the U.S. and Japan have other alternatives to the GATT, you've got to think twice."

All Quiet in Economy Class

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL

 BODY:
NO, I didn't sleep. I can never sleep on airplanes. But after more than eight hours overnight from Kennedy International Airport I arrived in Vienna surprisingly rested and fresh.
The Noise Buster, a new portable device to combat stress and fatigue caused by noise, did the trick. Basically a small electronic box wired to a pair of Sony MDR-84 stereo headphones, the system can create what seems like a personal island of quiet in noisy settings like planes, trains, buses or factories. 
 Ear plugs or bulky ear protectors, which can cut down the higher frequencies, are ineffective against low droning sounds like airplane engine noises, which penetrate mechanical barriers. It is precisely such throbbing vibrations that can cause tension and fatigue.
The Noise Buster deals with sound of this kind by artificially creating "anti-noise," which, for the person wearing the earphones, cancels the unwanted noise in the environment.
Until now, devices of this kind came with four-figure prices and were used mainly by the military. At $149, the Noise Buster, made by Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc. of Stamford, Conn., is the first model priced for the average consumer. A similar kind of anti-noise headset is under development by the Koss Corporation of Milwaukee, the largest maker of earphones in the United States.
The device uses a technology known as active noise cancellation, in which unwanted sound waves are snuffed out by the sound waves of the same frequency but in opposite phase. It as if a two-foot ocean wave were to meet a two-foot trough; the result would be flat water. So, too, when a sound wave meets its mirror opposite, a sonic calm is created.
As a journalist who writes about audio equipment, I was lent a Noise Buster for a working vacation with my wife, Shea, to my native Austria. When I slipped on the earphones during the flight, it suddenly seemed that the plane, a two-engine Airbus 320, had stopped flying and was quietly hovering in midair. A person tends to associate engine noise with motion, so when the noise stops we think the plane is standing still. Very relaxing.
Despite the feeling of sonic privacy, I wasn't really isolated. My wife, sitting next to me, could easily talk with me because the Noise Buster does not block frequencies above 1,500 hertz that make human speech intelligible. But because the lower frequencies were missing, it sounded as if she were talking on the telephone.
Other ambient noise -- a rushing sound reminiscent of ocean surf -- also persisted. But the more disturbing growl of the aircraft was virtually eliminated.
When the movie, "Groundhog Day," started in mid-Atlantic, I plugged the Noise Buster into the electronic earphone outlet on the armrest. Although it was a rather tame movie, I was surprised that the crucial scenes seemed to pack quite an emotional punch. Later I figured out why. The muffled roar of background noise that normally flattens the dialogue of in-flight movies had been filtered out by the Noise Buster. The actors' vocal nuances came through crisp and clear.
Although it can make plane travel more restful, the Noise Buster can't eliminate jet lag. After all, it can't change time zones or reset the diurnal clock we all carry in our biological systems. So I still woke up at odd hours after arriving in Austria, and I got hungry at the wrong times.

HEADLINE: JAMAICA;
Merchants Say a Change in Bus Routes Hurts

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Merchants in downtown Jamaica are once again fighting to preserve what they regard as the key to their economic well-being, the very thing they say insures the return of their customers each day: bus routes.
The Transit Authority last month began rerouting six bus lines that ran along Jamaica Avenue, the neighborhood's main commercial strip. The goal was to improve service to and from the Archer Avenue station, a stop on the E, F and J subway lines. 
 Many shop owners say the changes have already started to divert customers from the area. Last month, a group of merchants, along with the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce, sued to block the rerouting, but a judge dismissed the case.
"This is taking our livelihood away," said Fairfax Hackley, the manager of Gibbs Men Wear at 163-26 Jamaica Avenue, who says his rush-hour business is down 25 percent. "It's like taking a parking lot away from a shopping mall. It's like taking Penn Station away from 34th Street."
The standoff comes nearly four years after the authority agreed to expand bus service along Jamaica Avenue after an earlier lawsuit filed by local merchants.
"It's happening again," lamented Steven Alschuler, a spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce.
The latest rerouting was instituted after the city's Department of Traffic changed Archer Avenue from a one-way westbound street to two-way. The Q4, Q5, Q42, Q83, Q84 and Q85 bus lines were rerouted from Jamaica Avenue to Archer Avenue.
Before the changes, the buses traveled along Archer to the Archer Avenue subway station and then returned along Jamaica -- a route that transit officials say increased congestion and forced riders to use alternate means of transportation, including illegal vans.
The authority says the changes have already reduced travel time. "There's certainly been a vast improvement," said Jared S. Lebow, a spokesman. The authority also says that keeping the bus lines on Jamaica, given that it, like Archer, has been divided into east- and west-bound strips, would be disastrous for commuters.
And it says that the overall benefits for the neighborhood outweigh the relatively narrow concerns of the Jamaica Avenue group.
But officials at the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce say they plan to continue fighting. They recently conducted an informal survey and say that about 88 percent of the 80 merchants reported losses. Wertheimer's department store reported losing 20 percent of its rush-hour business; the store recently laid off 30 people to make up for its losses.
"We are hoping something will be done about this," said Jamie Brayan, the manager of Wertheimer's, who said the store moved there four years ago to cater to commuters.
"This is choking us," he added. "We don't know how long we will be able to maintain business this way." RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

HEADLINE: CLINTON;
Sex Industry Defends Itself

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Behind the yellow blinking lights of Manhattan Video, an adult store on 39th Street off Fifth Avenue, leaders of a new association met on Thursday to discuss strategy. The group, yet to be named, has a clear goal: to defend the sex industry against neighborhood protests and moves by the city toward increased regulation.
A loose coalition of some 50 sex businesses, the association was formed in reaction to the Manhattan Borough President's Task Force on the Regulation of Sex-Related Businesses, which was established last spring to address complaints about the spread of sex businesses in residential areas. 
 Richard N. Kunis, owner of Manhattan Video, said the first task was to survey the sex industry, including adult book dealers, novelty stores, strip clubs and topless bars. The association hopes to persuade the task force that the industry is economically valuable and does not promote crime.
At public hearings Wednesday, a dozen people in adult video and theater testified about objections to the task force. Most called the 30-member panel invalid because sex businesses were not represented.
But Douglas Turetsky, deputy director of policy and budget for Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, said the panel included "a diversity of opinions," adding that until now there has been no way to identify sex industry representatives.
Several witnesses said that sex businesses increase prostitution and drug dealing in neighborhoods. Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, said that in 1990, after the removal of many sex-related shops from 42d Street, crime dropped 60 percent. Susan Herman, founder of the Chelsea Action Coalition, called for new zoning to keep sex businesses out of residential areas.
Mr. Kunis, who has been in the adult video business for eight years, defended his colleagues: "We are law-abiding, taxpaying citizens with children." M.H.

HEADLINE: CO-OP CITY;
Countering a Surge in Vacancies

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Faced with the highest vacancy rate in its history, Co-op City has cut its staff and set out to lure buyers, providing low-interest loans, shortening the review process and offering for the first time wall-to-wall carpeting over the parquet floors.
While Co-op City officials said the vacancy rate peaked in July, the number of empty apartments has nearly doubled in the last year, to 1,200. As with other Mitchell-Lama apartments, owners sell their apartments back to the complex, for equity. The vacancies have led to concerns over cash shortages at the sprawling, 15,372-unit complex in the northeast Bronx, a 300-acre community with shopping malls, schools, community centers and its own power plant. 
 The situation has a strange resonance in the city's history. When Co-op City opened 23 years ago, offering subsidized housing to middle-income families, it drew many Jewish families from the Grand Concourse and other parts of the South Bronx. Those areas had in turn been settled by families from the Lower East Side. In each case, the vacuum was filled by new, often poorer groups.
"The same thing happened to the Grand Concourse," said James W. Parker, vice president of a co-op owners' association at the complex. "At one time there was a waiting list to get into Co-op City, but now people are moving out faster than they're being replaced."
Co-op officials and residents say the vacancies reflect the poor economy and the departure of original residents who have retired and moved to other states.
Concern over the diminishing base of maintenance fees has forced the cooperative's management group, the Riverbay Corporation, to reduce services. Nearly 100 gardeners, plumbers, janitors and other workers -- about 10 percent of the work force -- have been laid off in recent months.
Some residents worry that more reductions could compromise the stability of Co-op City, which operates on an annual budget of $128 million.
The Riverbay Corporation has reduced the initial payment that prospective buyers must put down, from $2,800 per room to $1,750 per room, and that has yielded results. Since July, there have been 638 applicants, up from about 700 in all of 1992. R.H.

HEADLINE: HARLEM;
Getting Respect From City Hall

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Michael Anglin stood amid weeds, broken glass and discarded needles in Morningside Park on a hill overlooking the paddleball courts at 122d Street, where he and his friends play after work. Eight blocks down, across the critical divide between the Upper West Side and Harlem, are a well-kept baseball diamond, new playground equipment and a waterfall, all of which the city has installed over the last few years.
"There are two parks," Mr. Anglin said. "It's like this is two towns." 
 Against what appear to be economic and political odds, he and his group are trying to remove that divide.
Four years ago, the Parks Department started to renovate Morningside Park, which stretches from 110th to 123d Streets. It started in the southern section, much of which had been closed since 1968, when Columbia University abandoned plans to build a gymnasium on the public property in the face of student protests.
Last summer, construction was completed on the part of the park from 110th to 114th Streets, with Columbia contributing $250,000 of the $5 million spent. Officials said they did not have money to do substantial work on the northern end.
The City Parks Foundation, a nonprofit group, donated some new equipment for a playground at 123d Street last year, said Bob Redmond, a member of the department's Manhattan staff, and the Parks Department is planning to renovate a stairway at 116th Street that he says is the section of the park in the worst condition.
Mr. Anglin and his Morningside Paddleball Players' Association have other concerns. "We began to feel that the only way you get respect is when you organize and you are angry," he said. "You have to compel them to think about you the way they would think about other parks in the city."
The association and its parent, Harlem Initiatives Together, an organization of groups and churches that is committed to increasing local political power, met with city officials last year. The northern section of Morningside Park is heavily used, they said, and needs major renovations as well as regular maintenance, constant police patrols and lights so residents who work days can use the park at night.
Patrick J. Pomposello, the Parks Department Commissioner for Manhattan, called the meeting curt. He said the department has tried to respond to the group's concerns, but that there is only one maintenance worker assigned to the entire 31-acre park.
The lights around the paddleball court are scheduled to go up this week, he said.
The group also asked to form a committee with the Parks Department to help plan capital improvements. Pastors from three churches that are near the park and use it for church functions said they would help solicit money to pay for projects.
"They want results and I don't blame them," Mr. Pomposello said. "But they're talking about real capital dollars. It's going to take I don't know how many millions to finish renovating that park, and we don't have any money in our budget."
Mr. Anglin said his group, which had done its own maintenance at the paddleball courts, would continue to press the city.
"Believe it or not, this is much better than it was," Mr. Anglin said as he trampled fallen branches and garbage along the pathways. "But you would never see anything like this in Central Park. Well, this is our Central Park." EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

Small Merchants Sprucing Up Along Mermaid Avenue

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
Because of a recent influx of city, state and private funds, the dilapidated mom-and-pop businesses along Mermaid Avenue are sprucing up and expanding in hopes of attracting families drawn to the area by an urban renewal program.
More than 2,000 people have moved in since 1981, filling the 700 homes built under urban renewal, but they tend to shop at the larger, more modern stores in Bensonhurst, Mill Basin and Bay Ridge. 
 And the population growth seems far from over. Construction began last month on 148 single-family homes on the side streets around Mermaid Avenue, a bustling shopping hub in the 1960's but the victim of a long decline. A Westchester-based developer, North American Properties, has already signed 65 contracts on the two-story homes, which go for $111,500.
"Our goal is to keep people in the community and provide the services they need," said Judith Orlando, executive director of Estella Development, a grass-roots organization whose charge is to provide affordable housing and initiate commercial revitalization in Coney Island.
Estella has received $240,000 in grant money for revitalization from the state Urban Development Corporation and the Manhattan-based Local Initiative Support Corporation. The money is used to match funds the merchants put up to refurbish their stores. Twenty of the 38 merchants along the mile-and-a-half commercial strip are restoring their buildings and repairing awnings and signs.
"Once they see awnings going up, we will have more merchants participating," Ms. Orlando predicted.
The revitalization coincides with the start of a $4.2 million project at the corner of West 17th Street and Mermaid Avenue. It includes two single-story buildings with four storefronts that will house a dental office, an ice cream store and a new office for Estella Development, and, in a nearby lot, a one-story storefront that will house a funeral parlor and a day care center.
"Coney Island is not dead, not by any means," said James Prince, owner of Major Meat Market at 1514 Mermaid Avenue, who received $4,000 to help upgrade his store. "There are still a lot of us here who have faith because we have the potential -- a wonderful beach and prime real estate. It just takes time. It took a long time for this community to go down. It will take a long time for it to go back up." LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

Last Chances to Caulk Before Winter's Onslaught

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE

 BODY:
ALL houses eventually need fresh caulking. The purpose of the compound, often called caulking or caulk, is to seal gaps and cracks that develop between materials. Unless the openings are sealed drafts can develop. Even worse, moisture can penetrate walls.
Any season except winter is a good time to renew caulking. In the winter temperatures are generally too cold to apply caulking. It flows poorly and will not harden when the thermometer dips below 50. 
 Tour the exterior of the house to examine the caulking around door and window frames, where siding joins at corners and meets the roof and foundation, around wall and roof vents, skylights and chimneys, around outdoor faucets and where plumbing and electric lines enter the house. Cracked or loose caulking has to be replaced. Any missing from those areas has to be added.
Read caulking labels carefully. The most important qualities are life expectancy, whether the material can be painted and whether cleanup is with soap and water or a solvent like paint thinner. A high-quality acrylic latex caulk is a good choice. Besides having a life expectancy of at least 20 years, it adheres to most surfaces, is easy to apply without being sticky and accepts paint.
A drawback is that the caulking sometimes shrinks severely. It is not recommended for cracks wider than about half an inch without special procedures.
Siliconized caulking, which contains a small amount of silicone, shrinks less and sometimes flows more smoothly. But cleaning up silicone caulking requires a solvent. Pure silicone caulking cannot be painted.
High-performance caulks containing polysulfide, polyurethane, ethylene copolymer and other compounds compete well. Pure latex has a short life expectancy, but is inexpensive and accepts paint well. It is a good choice for surfaces that will be painted every three to five years. It is also economical to use when preparing a house for sale.
Butyl caulk is recommended for masonry and metal, because it is very sticky. But it has a short life expectancy, requires a solvent for cleanup and does not accept paint. Virtually all high-quality or high-performance caulks adhere as well as butyl and perform better.
Caulk comes in cylindrical cartridges and is applied with a caulking gun that forces the material out of the tube. Guns that cradle the cartridge in a curved metal pan are the most popular and often the least expensive. But guns that contain the cartridge between two parallel metal strips, one above the cartridge and one below it, are also available.
Handy features on some guns are a built-in spout cutter, which eliminates having to slice off the ends of cartridge nozzles with a utility knife; a puncture tool, which ends having to use a long nail to open the seal in the cartridge, and a wrist strap, which frees hands.
To load a conventional gun, squeeze the trigger or press the ratchet-release tab on the handle, pull back on the plunger, and fit the cartridge into the gun, rear end first. Next, squeeze the trigger a few times until the plunger contacts the rear of the cartridge, but do not apply too much pressure.
Finally, slice off the end of the cartridge at a 45-degree angle and break the seal inside by inserting a long nail, ice pick or similar tool into the opening. With a gun having a spout-cutter and puncture tool, open the cartridge before inserting it.
Most caulk, especially latex varieties, work best to seal joints that are less than a half-inch deep or wide. Fill deeper cracks with wadded fiberglass or plastic backer rod. Wider cracks can usually be bridged by applying two strips of caulk side by side.
To apply caulk make sure that the surface is clean and dry. Pry out old caulk, brush away particles and wipe the area with mineral spirits. Place the nozzle of the cartridge against one end of the seam to be filled so that the gun forms a 45-degree angle with the seam. Squeeze the trigger to make the caulk flow while pushing or pulling the gun along the seam. Pushing the gun forces caulk into narrow seams better than pulling, but either technique is correct.
Move the gun evenly. Caulking will adhere better if the gun is moved slowly. Learn to keep the gun moving between trigger strokes and adjust the speed to how the compound emerges from the nozzle.
To stop caulking at the end of a seam, push the nozzle into the corner to sever the strip and then twist the nozzle sharply while lifting the gun away. Pull the plunger away from the rear of the cartridge immediately to prevent caulk from oozing from the nozzle. Wipe off the tip before starting a new seam.
Caulking need not be smoothed after application, except for appearance. Smoothing caulking as it dries sometimes causes cracking. If you decide to smooth caulk use the back of a spoon dipped in a solvent. With latex caulk use a finger dipped in water. Allow caulk to dry according to the instructions before painting.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: HARM'S WAY;
U. S. Pays Dearly For an Education In Somalia

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HOW did an operation that began with American soldiers feeding starving Somalis wind up with an American soldier's corpse being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by Somalis starving only for revenge?
The answer is a tangled web of good intentions gone awry, political miscalculations and military blunders. Together they add up to a chilling object lesson for American engagement abroad in the post-cold war world. 
 But the Somalia story is not over. President Clinton made that clear in his address to the nation last week when, in response to mounting American casualties in the Somali capital and growing domestic opposition to the American involvement there, he announced a doubling of United States ground forces to protect American troops and a March 31 deadline for their withdrawal.
There is a lot riding on how that deadline is met. If a measure of normalcy can yet be restored and Somalia becomes an example of a reasonably successful humanitarian relief operation, there may be hope for Bosnia or Haiti or other failed states desperately in need of outside help as they limp and moan toward the 21st century.
But if Somalia becomes the Beirut or Vietnam of the 1990's, it could have a far-reaching impact. Taken on its own, this little country on the Horn of Africa is irrelevant to vital American interests. Life in America will not be affected whether Somalia wallows in anarchy or emerges from the ashes. But there are other Somalias. Each on its own also represents no threat to vital American interests. But what happens if they are all ignored -- Somalia, Bosnia, Georgia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Haiti -- and who knows how many others to come? One answer is that the United States could wake up 10 years from now and discover that the world has diplomatic cancer -- a mass of failed states metastasizing in a cycle of violence and underdevelopment and slowly sapping the strength of the international system.
 
Needed: Order From Chaos
 That is what makes learning the lessons of Somalia so urgent. Perhaps the most important is that there is rarely such a thing as simple humanitarian intervention, where the United States goes into a country solely to feed the hungry and pass out chewing gum. Humanitarian crises, save for natural disasters, almost always have political roots and can be addressed in a lasting way only if the political problems are addressed. Somalia was short of food not because of bad rains, but because of bad reigns -- a succession of venal warlords whose infighting after the 1991 overthrow of the dictator Mohammed Siad Barre disrupted food distribution.
In the long run, it will be impossible for the Somalia operation to succeed without a working government. Virtually all humanitarian interventions require nation-building. The Reagan Administration learned this rule the hard way in Lebanon, the Bush Administration ignored it when it sent American troops to Somalia last December and the Clinton Administration, which inherited the operation, has been only slowly catching on. In such cases, humanitarian intervention has to be accompanied by a division of diplomats with blueprints for political reconstruction.
If it is true that humanitarian intervention and nation-building go hand-in-hand, the question becomes: does the United States have the will, the wallet and the wiles to make it work?
 
Just Another Faction
 The question of wiles arises because when the United States enters a country with no stable political center, it immediately becomes a faction; politics won't stop because people are hungry. American troops in Somalia saw themselves as the Red Cross, but local political leaders effectively viewed them as the Clinton clan, or, as the Lebanese used to call the Marine peacekeepers in Beirut in 1982, "the international militia."
The Clinton clan had three choices in Somalia: to ally itself with another clan and help it take power, to try to take over the country itself, or to try to broker a power-sharing deal. Unfortunately, the Americans stumbled among all three options, sometimes aligning themselves against the warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, sometimes brokering deals and sometimes leaving Somalis the impression that the United States would try to run the country.
Thinking like a clan leader does not come naturally to the American statesman. To play this role requires a degree of guile and willingness to absorb pain that Americans were initially unprepared for in Somalia. The key is learning how to bend, how to wink and nod, how to pressure people indirectly and how to play factions off against one another. In his dealings with General Aidid, Adm. Jonathan Howe, the man overseeing the American operation in Mogadishu, has been noticeably lacking in these instincts. There is something almost farcical about the notion of the United Nations issuing an arrest warrant for General Aidid in Mogadishu: habeas corpus in Dante's Inferno, Miranda rights in no man's land.
President Clinton has finally decided that the American clan will play a brokering role in Somalia. He has dispatched the envoy Robert Oakley back to the country this weekend with authorization to wheel and deal.
"We have no interest in denying anybody access to playing a role in Somalia's political future," Mr. Clinton said on Friday, signaling his willingness to include General Aidid in a power-sharing accord provided he returns an American captive and plays ball politically.
There is an old rabbinical saying: "Where there is truth there is no peace and where there is peace there is no truth." It conveys the notion that gray compromises are what make life possible, and that is particularly true when nation-building in a place like Mogadishu.
As for the ability of American forces to absorb pain, the death of one soldier on a mercy mission to Somalia is one too many. But a soldier's job is to fight. Some Americans seem to have forgotten in recent years that you join the Army not just to get a G.I. loan. There is something slightly hysterical about members of Congress rushing to call the troops home the minute a few are killed.
On the other hand, the Bush and Clinton Administrations helped to produce that frenzy by not leveling with the American people from the start that humanitarian intervention and nation-building are high-risk endeavors. Americans were told that their soldiers were being sent to work in a soup kitchen and they were understandably shocked to find them in house-to-house combat.
Had all the risks, pain and costs of humanitarian intervention been laid out by President Bush to the American people from the start, President Clinton might now have more time to see it through to reasonable success. As it happens, he has been forced by Congress to impose a six-month time limit to give the process "a fighting chance." But since the Americans have already bought a departure ticket, Somalia's warlords are likely to lie low and wait the Americans out. Meanwhile, would-be Somali reformers will hardly be emboldened by the likelihood that when the Americans leave, accounts will be settled in time-honored Somali ways. This six-month interregnum seems more like a decent interval to cover a retreat than a serious initiative; you don't do nation-building with a stopwatch.
In fairness to Mr. Clinton, he is only doing what the country wants. But this is a moment of truth for him too. From the start, Mr. Clinton has understood that America does not have the economic resources to remain engaged abroad as it was during the cold war. But Mr. Clinton wanted to maintain an active, pro-democracy agenda abroad, up to the traditional American leadership role. He hoped that through the United Nations the United States could lead and that many others would pay.
But there is no free lunch in diplomacy. As the United Nations naturally took on a nation-building role, the Clinton Administration paid little heed even as it voted for each resolution. Things were quiet; Somalia seemed the sort of low-maintenance, high-political-reward operation that the Clinton team had in mind. But that equation was exploded by last Sunday's street fighting in Mogadishu, exposing the 33-country United Nations peacekeeping unit in Somalia as a Tower of Babel, and driving home to Americans the real, weighty role they would have to play if Somalia is to succeed.
"I don't think we will give up trying to use the U.N. to leverage our involvement to do things that are worth doing, but not worth doing alone," said an Administration official. "But I think we will be far more skeptical about the ability of the United Nations to operate without vigorous involvement of the United States. Ultimately the U.N. is us. You can't hand off to an entity that is a bunch of bureaucrats who have never done this before."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The States' Stakes In Clinton's Health Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ANY social program as vast and complex as President Clinton's health-care plan has to have disparate effects on a country as vast and complex as the United States. For all of its specificity, the plan has left the states trying to figure whether they would be winners or losers.
Take Texas, the state with the highest percentage of workers (25.3 percent) who have no health insurance. By requiring all employers to pay for health insurance, the plan would hit Texas businesses especially hard. But this mandate should mean better health care for 3.8 million uninsured Texans. 
 The pain that the state feels would be offset, at least in part, by its disproportionate share of the more than $80 billion in yearly subsidies that Mr. Clinton has promised to small, low-wage employers and Americans with low incomes. Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Arkansas are in the same situation, with a high rate of uninsured workers but low wages that would make many eligible for subsidies.
Compare those states with Connecticut, which has the lowest percentage (8.8 percent) of uninsured workers. As a result, the employer mandate would do minimal damage to Connecticut business. But as a high-wage state, Connecticut is expected to receive little in the way of subsidies. New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan have the same pattern.
Some economists predict that the plan would funnel tens of billions of dollars from the high-wage North to the low-wage South by the year 2000. Members of Congress from the Northeast and Midwest have even asked for a meeting with Hillary Rodham Clinton about the matter.
"We're concerned about the redistributional effects," said Paula Duggan, a senior policy analyst at the Northeast-Midwest Institute, which does research for members of Congress from those two regions. "We're concerned that these subsidies will benefit the South at the expense of the Northeast and Midwest."
But Administration officials deny that the health plan would redistribute wealth from North to South, insisting that it will merely take money from cigarette taxes and health care savings to pay for the subsidies.
Midwestern states should not cry too much, the officials say, because Mr. Clinton has thrown several scraps their way. Heavy industry concentrated in these states, especially auto, steel and rubber companies, have grumbled nonstop about medical costs gobbling up 12, 15, even 20 percent of their payrolls. Those industries should benefit most from the proposed 7.9 percent limit on the amount of an employer's payroll going to health insurance. The industrial Midwest should also benefit from the President's proposal to have Washington assume most of the corporate burden of insuring early retirees.
As for the Northeast, Administration officials say New York and New Jersey would also receive a bundle of subsidies because those states have high medical costs and many low-wage workers and families on welfare.
California has different concerns. It has the highest rate (30.6 percent) of participation in health maintenance organizations. This means that when Mr. Clinton's plan pushes doctors and hospitals to begin a frenetic minuet to find partners and form networks, California would not undergo the same degree of upheaval as some other states. Nor would Californians, who are generally familiar with managed care, feel that they were plunging blindly into a social experiment. Minnesota, Oregon, Massachusetts are in the same position, with high participation in H.M.O.'s.
But since those states are already chopping away at health-care inflation, the Clinton plan may not offer them as much help in restraining costs.
On the other end of the spectrum are Montana and North Dakota, where just 1 percent of the population belongs to H.M.O.'s. Hardly anyone expects it to be easy for those states to form networks that join doctors from small communities dozens of miles apart.
"Managed care is going to be a whole new way of life in a state like North Dakota," said Stephen Raetzman, a health-care expert at Towers Perrin, a consulting firm. "It's a very different process from regular fee-for-service medicine."
The good news for rural states is that the President's plan promises billions of dollars for care in underserved areas.
In contrast, the Middle Atlantic states are overserved, many health-care experts say, meaning they have an excess of hospitals. As the Clinton plan strives to squeeze down costs, New York hospitals might be hit hard, although the savings would help employers and patients.
John Gannon, chief health-care consultant at KPMG Peat Marwick, noted that Medicare beneficiaries on the East Coast spend three days in the hospital a year on average -- about double the level on the West Coast. "The amount of care on the East Coast far exceeds the West Coast," said Mr. Gannon. "I think we'll see a significant downsizing of the in-patient health-care system in New York and New Jersey."
The President's plan would have unusual effects on the New York area for another reason: the huge number of New Jersey and Connecticut residents work in Manhattan and receive medical care there. A big question is whether New Jersey and Connecticut residents who sign up with health plans in their home states would be able to continue visiting New York doctors and hospitals. No problem, Administration officials say, asserting that Manhattan doctors and hospitals will be free to participate in New Jersey and Connecticut health-care networks; doctors reply that that is easier said than done.
"Developing health plans in the New York metropolitan marketplace isn't going to be easy because it involves three states and because of the population density," said Mr. Gannon. "It's going to be a slow, very complex process."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: Moderate Meddling;
From Asia, Models for Growing Economies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
FOR more than a decade, economists and politicians have been looking for a secret formula in the waters that run from the Sea of Japan to the South China Sea. No other region of the world has seen such remarkable economic growth, nor such dramatic improvements in everything from education to life expectancy. For a world stuck in economic stagnation, what common lessons are there in the experiences of Japan, the "four tigers" -- Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea -- and now the other booming economies of Southeast Asia?
For a while, no one was sure they wanted an answer. Isao Kubota, an official of the Japan's Ministry of Finance, likes to recall that neo-classical economists, uneasy with the idea that government meddling with the free market might actually work, used to argue that "countries in the region owed their success entirely to Confucianism." But a new study by the World Bank, published just ahead of the summit of Asian Pacific leaders in Seattle next month, suggests that even though there is no single "Asian model," government intervention and the targeting of industries for special assistance often works -- if done the right way, and not for too long. 
 The report comes at an odd moment for industrial policy. Japan, the most successful adherent, is finally turning to the ugly work of getting rid of policies that favored producers over consumers and left a number of domestic industries overprotected, under-competitive and breeding grounds for corruption. The man known as the father of industrial policy, Naohiro Amaya, says that "what Japan needs now is a negative industrial policy."
Meanwhile the United States is finally beginning the kind of industrial initiatives President Clinton talked about during the Presidential campaign. In a program reminiscent of the glory days of MITI, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, it recently announced a project to join the Big Three auto makers together to develop a super-fuel-efficient car.
Not surprisingly, the World Bank seeks to offend no one in the bitter arguments over industrial policy. Most important, it concluded, was "getting the fundamentals right" -- keep inflation and interest rates low, savings high and investment in technology stratospheric. It plays down targeting specific industries, but the successful results in Japan and South Korea overwhelm the statistics. How else would Japan, a country with no resources of its own, develop overnight a huge petrochemicals industry enabling it to profit from the oil trade? "We invented it," said Mr. Amaya.
 
Education First
 Not surprisingly, the report concludes that among the most important industrial policies is education, devoting the vast majority of education resources to primary schools. Moreover, almost all the eight "high performing" Asian nations made sure wealth was shared, focusing on public housing and the virtual elimination of poverty. They compelled the public to save, taxed luxury items heavily, then used the huge pool of public savings to help issue low-cost loans to industry. But except for Hong Kong and Singapore, whose tiny size made it critical that they become the cheapest and freest place to move goods and money, almost all protected domestic industries with import barriers. You still cannot buy a Japanese car in Seoul.
The bank tiptoes around the subject the Japanese hint is critically important: the role of ethnicity and culture in the pace of growth. How did the bug that swept through Southeast Asia manage to keep from infecting the Philippines, a country with Spanish, American and Catholic culture? Why in Malaysia, one of the hottest new economies, have the ethnic Chinese so outperformed the Malay majority? It is no surprise that China itself most admires its brethren in Singapore, whose wealth surged ahead of Malaysia after the two separated in 1965.
The bad news for those seeking to emulate success stories like Singapore is that the days when one could export one's way to wealth are dwindling. "Now that the cold war is over, Western countries have less incentive to provide security cover for Asia," Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's Prime Minister, said, "or to keep their markets open to buttress non-Communist states." Exporters from Asia are no longer very welcome in the West, and America is no longer willing to tolerate closed markets in Asia.
The bank dwells little on the most successful facet of Japanese industrial policy: research and development consortiums, much like the new project for the Big Three. Measuring their success is hard, but they cost so little that nations can afford to run down a lot of blind alleys.
But those consortiums may be the last vestiges of the Japanese approach. Running the world from a desk at MITI isn't a lot of fun these days: rather than planning the next great chip project, the ministry's bureaucrats spend their days defusing trade time-bombs with the Americans.
Japan's sudden craze for deregulation is essentially aimed at breaking open the weave of laws and restrictions that have kept prices high and newcomers, Americans and Japanese alike, out of many industries. In areas like transportation and construction, one can argue that industrial policy did more far more harm than good, leaving productivity rates low and turning the protected industries into hotbeds of corruption. The scandals that ultimately brought down the ruling Liberal Democratic Party after 38 years had a common root: new competitors paid politicians to get past the maze of vague rules, remnants of industrial policy that kept them from lucrative near-monopolies.
Japan's lesson is not that industrial policy is necessarily misguided -- although sometimes it is -- but that it can go on for too long.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: The Picture From the Census Bureau;
Poverty 1993: Bigger, Deeper, Younger, Getting Worse

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN 1971, Robert J. Lampman, one of the intellectual architects of the war on poverty, wrote that poverty could be eliminated before 1980, "at which time the next generation will have set new economic and social goals."
His optimism, as he now recalls, was based on historical trends. From 1961 to 1971, the number of poor people fell by more than one-third, to 25.6 million from 39.6 million. Many economists shared Mr. Lampman's belief that, with an active Government and a growing economy, the poverty problem would be "solved in the near future." 
 Last week the Census Bureau reported different findings: even with the end of the latest recession, poverty is increasing. The number of poor people rose in 1992 for the third consecutive year, reaching 36.9 million, or 14.5 percent of the population. In 1971, it stood at 12.5 percent.
The standard of living for poor people is better in some ways than it was three decades ago, but in other ways it is worse.
Poverty statistics do not reflect the improvement attributable to many types of assistance. The standard definition of income, used in measuring poverty, excludes the value of noncash benefits like Medicaid, food stamps and housing subsidies.
Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said, "When you go into the home of someone on welfare, you will see more consumer goods and a higher standard of living than would have been imagined 30 years ago."
Low-income people have better access to health care, through Medicaid, created in 1965. Many have food stamps, under a program created in the early 1960's. And "there has been a steady increase in the quality of the nation's housing stock," said Peter Eisinger, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin.
The continuing debate over the relative condition of poor people is itself remarkable. Peter T. Gottschalk, professor of economics at Boston College, said, "If you had told me in 1963 or 1973 that we'd be arguing, in 1993, whether poor people are marginally better off, I would have been incredulous."
The face of poverty today is much younger. Social Security, automatically increased each year to keep pace with inflation, and private pensions have sharply reduced poverty among the elderly. The poverty rate for the elderly fell below the rate for the nation as a whole in 1982, and it has been lower ever since. But the poverty rate among children under 18, after declining to a low of 14 percent in 1969, rose to a peak of 22.3 percent in 1983 and now stands at 21.9 percent.
"The poor population is much less agricultural, much less rural than it once was," said Mr. Lampman, an economist who taught for 30 years at the University of Wisconsin.
Poverty has also deepened and become more concentrated. Ronald B. Mincy, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said, "There are almost twice as many people living in concentrated poverty areas in 1990 as in 1980." These areas, more often called ghettos, are defined as census tracts where at least 40 percent of the residents are poor. The number of people in such areas rose to 10.4 million in 1990, from 5.6 million in 1980 and 3.7 million in 1970, Mr. Mincy said.
The growing concentration of poverty occurs for various reasons. Poor people may move into a neighborhood. More affluent people may move out. Or incomes may decline, even when there is no migration.
In the 1970's, Mr. Mincy said, the concentration of poverty occurred mainly among blacks in major metropolitan areas. But in the 1980's, he said, "the growth in concentrated poverty was substantially higher among non-Hispanic whites in smaller metropolitan areas like Louisville, Ky., and Tulsa, Okla."
Poor people today have more Social Security and other Government benefits, but they probably have less physical security. "Violent neighborhood crime, random shootings make life for the very poor much worse," said Mr. Besharov.
Frank Levy, a professor of urban economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggests that poor people have dimmer prospects than 30 years ago because of changes in labor markets that work to the disadvantage of less-skilled workers.
"The gap between the earnings of a 30-year-old high school graduate and the earnings of a 30-year-old college graduate is wider than it was 30 years ago," said Mr. Levy. "More important, real wages were going up in the 60's, but now they're flat."
Likewise, Professor Eisinger said, "The structure of employment opportunities has changed in the last 20 years, with the relative decline in maufacturing employment, which is highly paid, and the enormous rise of low-paid service sector jobs."
A person working 30 hours a week and getting twice the minimum wage still does not earn enough to keep a family of four above the official poverty level, which last year was $14,335.
The poverty level was first set in 1964, at three times the amount of a low-cost food plan, and is adjusted annually to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index.
Peter B. Edelman, counselor to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that, in addition to the economic changes of the last 25 years, "we lost our national will to do something about poverty." He asserted that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush had shown "an unremitting lack of concern" about the problem.
Conservatives say some of the liberals' solutions aggravated the problem. Mr. Bush argued that programs intended to help people out of poverty invited dependency, and some Democrats agree. A study by the National Academy of Sciences in 1990 found that some Federal programs, like high-rise public housing projects, had actually reinforced the concentration of poor people in blighted urban areas high in unemployment and crime.
Sheldon Danziger, a professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan, said: "In the post-World War II boom, which ran from the late 1940's to 1973, it really was true that a rising tide lifted all boats. Some people say the poverty rate is high today because the war on poverty failed. But I say it's because the economy has failed since 1973."

HEADLINE: Neighbors Seek to Raze a Racial Wall

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOLEDO, Ohio, Oct. 3

 BODY:
For years, nothing ever happened to persuade the residents of Van Buren Avenue and the tenants of the Ravine Park Village public housing development to put away their fears and share a cup of coffee the way neighbors often do.
Separated by a lonely field and a generation of suspicion and stereotype, the middle- and working-class whites of Van Buren and the harder pressed blacks of Ravine Park followed the same code: you stay in your world and we'll stay in ours. 
 Then around dinner time on July 17, a white off-duty police officer who lives on Van Buren shot a 6-year-old black boy from Ravine Park in the leg after the officer said he caught the child throwing stones into his backyard swimming pool. The boy, Christopher Bell, survived.
The officer, William Beals Jr., 48, said the shooting was an accident. But in the next days and weeks most of America's troubles and doubts about race and justice seemed to explode like a cluster bomb in the area. There was a protest march, racist hecklers, primping politicians, angry community organizers and death threats.
 
Neighborhood Committee
 Several days after the shooting, Officer's Beals's house was destroyed by arson. Afterward, his neighbors asked, "Who is next?"
The fire scared some people awake. But instead of retreating behind locked doors and bitter words, a small group of people from Van Buren and Ravine Park slowly started working together to heal their troubled district in the east side of Toledo.
They formed a neighborhood committee and a block watch. And they put pressure on city officials to speed construction of a new playground, which they hope will be ready by spring.
Several residents argued that if Christopher had had such a place to play, he might not have been throwing stones in Mr. Beal's backyard, and if he had not, the officer would not be facing disgrace, the rebuilding of his house, a Nov. 1 trial for assault and possible dismissal from his job with the police department in the Toledo suburb of Oregon.
But the neighbors say they know they cannot worry about maybes, what-ifs and should-have-beens. They have too much work to do, mending fences and hearts.
"We just need to get along," said Darla Pratt, 21, a Ravine Park resident who has not attended any meetings of the group. "Some people still have prejudice in their heart because the little boy got shot. You shouldn't blame everybody for one person's action."
 
'We're Making Some Progress'
 Last month, a group of blacks and their white neighbors held a neighborhood cleanup, sharing brooms and a picnic lunch. They are planning a Halloween party. They are learning the names of each other's children. They call each other on the telephone.
Sometimes, they even share a cup of coffee.
To be sure, the barricades of mistrust and silent anger are still up. Only 18 people took part in the cleanup.
"But before the shooting and the fire, we never did anything together," said Leora Robinson, a resident of Ravine Park. "We never communicated. A lot of people were afraid of each other. They still are. But we're making some progress. It's a shame it took a tragedy to bring us together."
For some Van Buren residents, like Lawson Reeder, it seems hard to believe that it has only been a few weeks since their attitudes began to change about life in Ravine Park Village.
Before the shooting, Mr. Reeder said he did not dare set foot in the village. A white man would have to be crazy or desperate for drugs to go into the development, at least that is what many people had been saying for years.
Almost everyone who lives in the rows of story-and-a-half houses along Van Buren has heard and exchanged the same gossip about those people across the way: The project is crawling with lazy minority people living on welfare and cheap wine.
 
Never Knew His Neighbors
 Some of the stories sounded pretty wild, Mr. Reeder had to admit, but at 62 and retired, he figured he was getting too old to go find out the truth for himself.
So he never bothered to get to know anyone in the village, until Officer Beals, his next-door neighbor, one day picked up a gun and ran outside to chase Christopher down.
"I don't think the shooting was racial," Mr. Reeder said. "And I don't think it was intentional. But it's an awful tragedy, that's for sure. And now we're trying to get something positive out of a negative."
He says he still cannot believe how far he and his friends have traveled in such a short time, in real distance only about 50 yards across a field in the back of their houses.
"I was a little apprehensive the first time I went into the village; I had never faced them before," Mr. Reeder said. "But I found out that most of them will talk to me and I don't have any problems. I also found out listening to some of the younger black people that they're afraid to walk down the street on Van Buren because somebody might shoot them. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Nobody is going to hurt them."
There were other lessons.
"I used to think everyone in here was a transient," he said. "But I found out a lot of people have been here a long time. They have deep roots. I thought everyone was unemployed and on welfare. That's not true, either. A lot of people work. The problem is, they're trapped in low-wage jobs. I also thought this place was all black. It isn't. There are whites living here, and they all get along."
 
'Looking for Answers'
 The village is about 80 percent black and 15 percent white. Hispanics residents and a handful of Asians make up the rest of the 166 families that live there. Toledo, a city of about 330,000 people, is 20 percent black.
But it was not until someone threw a fire bomb onto the officer's porch that some of the residents of Van Buren decided to learn the facts of life in the development.
Who threw the bomb is uncertain. But shortly after the fire city officials moved to persuade the people from Van Buren and the residents of Ravine Park to start talking. A meeting was held, but the people who showed up were outnumbered by reporters, politicians, police officials and community organizers from other neighborhoods. Voices were loud, tempers hot.
"We didn't get much done until the outsiders left," Mr. Reeder said. "We weren't looking for politicians. We were looking for answers."
But one question was asked that still haunts many people.
"Why didn't they come together after that boy was shot?" wondered the Rev. Floyd Rose, a civil rights advocate in Toledo. "Why did it take the burning of the house to get some action? My position is that they cared more about that white man's house than that boy's life."
 
Feeling a Silent Hostility
 Perhaps the pastor is right, Mrs. Robinson said, but for now what matters is that things are beginning to change.
A home care attendant, Mrs. Robinson has lived in Ravine Park for 18 years and for most of that time she says she has felt a silent hostility from the people who live on Van Buren.
"On Van Buren if a home gets broken into or a kid's bike is taken, the people there just assume someone from the Ravine did it," Mrs. Robinson said. "They look at us as lowlifes. Basically, it was people being afraid of the unknown and listening to too many negative stories."
Kim Martin, a 30-year-old white nurse who grew up on Van Buren, said she was affected by such stories. "I hate to say it but I had nothing but a negative attitude about the village," she said. "I had never been exposed to anything positive from there."
She has become involved in the neighborhood committee and the block-watch program, but she hates to say that it took a 6-year-old boy's being shot to open her eyes "that there are a lot of good people everywhere."
"Because of this, my children won't be like I was," she said. "They won't have to wait so long to find out the truth."

HEADLINE: Studies Find Benefits of Subsidies are Meager

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Supporters of the Agriculture Department's export subsidies say the programs opened new markets for American farm products and helped preserve old markets in the face of large European subsidies.
But trade statistics and Government reports, including the Agriculture Department's own studies, provide little evidence that the programs have helped American exports substantially. 
 "Generally, all the people who have studied these things reach a similar conclusion: It just doesn't work," said Cletus C. Coughlin, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who has studied subsidized wheat sales.
Since 1986, more than 80 percent of the money in one program has been spent to subsidize wheat sales. But while wheat exports increased in 1987 and 1988, the department's researchers credited the subsidies with only 20 percent of that growth; the rest was attributed to other factors. After 1988, wheat exports declined, falling below the levels that prevailed before the program started, trade records show.
The same trend is evident in market share. America sold 30 percent of all world wheat exports in the 1986 crop year. That grew to 41 percent by May 1988, then slumped to 30 percent last month.
The European Community's share of world wheat exports now stands just shy of 20 percent -- about four percentage points higher than in 1980. Similar patterns can be seen in feed grains, corn, rice and soybean products.
Export subsidies have been part of Federal farm aid since the Depression, but most Depression-era programs were scrapped in the early 1970's, when American farmers benefited from a turbulent boom in global trade, fed by escalating oil prices. By the late 70's, high interest rates and a strong dollar were undermining those gains, and farm groups began to demand Federal help.
In response, the Agriculture Department created an elaborate system of loan guarantees, cash payments and tax-financed promotional campaigns for farm exports.
There are two principal programs. In one, the General Sales Manager program, the Government guarantees the repayment of $40 billion in commercial bank loans for countries that could not otherwise get credit to buy American farm products. Most of those guarantees cover loans to Iraq, Mexico and the former Soviet Union. About $4.6 billion of those loans are in default, with American taxpayers picking up the payments.
The second program reimburses exporters -- with cash or surplus crops stockpiled by the Government -- to offset price reductions they must offer to compete in foreign markets. Under this program, known as the Export Enhancement Program, the Government has spent about $5.4 billion to subsidize about $18 billion worth of exports. A third, smaller effort provides up to $1.25 billion in direct grants to finance promotional campaigns.
By and large, these programs are an inefficient way to help American farmers, said Robert Paarlberg, a political science professor at Wellesley College and an associate of the Harvard Center for International Affairs. "In the case of wheat, for example, the Government could provide a greater benefit to wheat farmers at lower cost to the taxpayers if it simply purchased the surplus wheat and burned it," he said.
And the General Sales Manager program "is a way of trying to buy, or at least rent, foreign customers at considerable risk to taxpayers," he said. "Sure, it doesn't cost you a penny until there's a default -- but then it costs you billions." DIANA B. HENRIQUES

HEADLINE: POLLUTION REMEDY IS HOTLY DEBATED

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BEDFORD, Mass., Oct. 9

 BODY:
Angela Days's son Joey nearly died of leukemia 13 years ago. His struggle to survive transformed Mrs. Days from a homemaker to something of a rabble-rouser.
Convinced that the boy's cancer was caused in part by pollution, she lobbied successfully to have the chemical-laden Achusnet River placed on the 1982 Federal list of the nation's most toxic hazardous-waste dumps. 
 But now, Mrs. Days says she regrets her advocacy and fears that it contributed to what she views as an even greater peril: a portable incinerator that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to bring in next spring to burn what the agency says is the nation's most serious contamination by PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls.
"We are scared that the incinerator might cause more children to get cancer and that Joey might relapse once the burning starts," she said this week.
 
Comparing Hazards
 A growing number of parents in this working-class community, heavily populated by Portuguese immigrants, say the E.P.A.'s cure is far more threatening than the chemicals that lie in sediment at the bottom of New Bedford Harbor. In a referendum in November 1991, 87 percent of the voters opposed the incinerator plan.
But E.P.A. officials say incineration is the best solution in New Bedford, where PCB's evaporating from the river bank sometimes reach levels in the air 1,000 times higher than allowed by the state's safety guidelines. Compounding the problem, officials say, is that many people eat fish from the polluted waters.
Environmental officials say that over four months they will dredge up and burn more than 7,500 tons of contaminated muck lying on the river bottom. They say emissions will be safe. Opponents say the burning will spew byproducts like lead, cadmium and dioxin into air.
 
Politicians Add Voices
 Local politicians have joined the battle, with 11 City Council members accusing Federal officials of bullying them into a cleanup plan they oppose. They recently passed ordinances intended to keep out the unwanted incinerator by banning incineration equipment from being transported on city streets and barring water and electrical hookups to the incineration site.
The two Democratic Senators from Massachusetts, Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry, wrote to the Administrator of the E.P.A., Carol M. Browner, last summer, urging her to consider another cleanup method. Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat who inherited the city in last year's Congressional redistricting, wrote to President Clinton asking the White House to become involved.
Federal officials have retaliated, threatening the financially troubled city with fines of $25,000 a day for blocking a federally mandated cleanup under the E.P.A.'s Superfund program. They also took the city to court last month and obtained a temporary order from Federal District Court in Boston blocking the ordinance prohibiting utility service and access to the site. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday on whether to continue the order and perhaps assess fines dating to Sept. 16, when local ordinances halted the cleanup. Federal workers have resumed work on the site.
 
Compromise Suggested
 New Bedford's Mayor, Rosemary S. Tierney, said she was trying to persuade the City Council to allow a test burn in May so that experts can analyze whether the incinerator will spew pollutants.
The threat of Federal fines comes at a bad time for New Bedford, which like many old industrial cities is already under financial strain. The city is paying half the cost of a $180 million sewage treatment plant, and it must come up with more than $2 million under the state's recently enacted education overhaul law.
Unemployment in the area is more than twice the national average of 6.9 percent. In fact, most of the factories and mills that began dumping their wastes into the Achusnet River in the 1940's are long gone.
"The bottom line," said Mayor Tierney, "is that $25,000 a day is one teacher in a classroom for a year, one cop on a beat, one firefighter on a piece of fire-fighting equipment."
The site for the planned incinerator is now a soccer field attached to a playground. Triple-decker tenements and businesses are beyond the playground. Six schools sit within a mile of the site and more than 100,000 people live within three miles in New Bedford, and neighboring Fairhaven and Achusnet.
 
Class Distinctions
 Last year, a National Law Review study cited the New Bedford incinerator plan as an example of environmental racism, by which critics mean that pollution is handled differently in poor and minority areas than in richer, better-educated districts.
E.P.A. officials said that local opposition was common at toxic-waste cleanups but that the New Bedford opposition was particularly aggressive.
"We're not looking for confrontation here; we're just trying to do our job," said Harley Laing, E.P.A. counsel for the New England region. "New Bedford would be a very bad precedent if we had to stop in the middle after all the years of work and the studies that have been done."

HEADLINE: Mysteries Circle Vietnamese At Center of Brown Inquiry

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CORAL SPRINGS, Fla., Oct. 8

 BODY:
He rose at an early age to the top of the South Vietnamese Government, but he refused to flee as Saigon fell. The conquering Communists did not send him to the prison camps where they banished other South Vietnamese officials. Instead they gave him a comfortable Government post.
For the last few years, he has been living with his family in a four-bedroom, waterfront house on a cul-de-sac in Coral Springs. His daughter says he has had no job. His former business partner says that he has been trying to bribe the Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, to help lift the trade embargo against Vietnam. 
 A number of mysteries now surround Nguyen Van Hao, 54, who has emerged at the center of a Federal investigation that seems to have spilled from a James Bond novel. He holds the answer to the question being asked by investigators in Washington and Miami: Did he and the Vietnamese Government bribe Mr. Brown?
Mr. Brown has dismissed the accusations as ludicrous, and there is no evidence that he received any money or broke any law. But after first cultivating the impression that he did not know Mr. Hao, Mr. Brown, through his lawyer, has acknowledged meeting with him on three occasions.
 
Saigon, Haiti and Florida
 Mr. Hao (pronounced like "how") was called before a Federal grand jury in Miami. He has made no public comments and has disappeared from his home. His wife, speaking from the aisles of the family-owned convenience store, will say only that he is an "honest man."
Mr. Hao's biography winds through Saigon, Haiti and Florida and discloses a remarkable talent for making connections. His resume lists a doctorate in economics from the University of Geneva. He married into a prominent South Vietnamese family and rose through the Government at lightning speed, earning a reputation for intelligence, sophistication and charm.
As a deputy prime minister during the fall of Saigon, he was, at age 36, essentially the country's third-ranking official. "He made a very good impression on all of us," said Thomas Polgar, a former Saigon station chief for the Central Intelligence Agency.
His smooth transition after the Communist takeover led some of his former colleagues, then in prison, to suspect that he had been an agent for the Communists. Mr. Hao has angrily denied it, and some accounts of the war's end portray him as a brave, even heroic, patriot, who risked his life for his homeland.
 
Lore of Gold Theft
 As the city fell, Mr. Hao went on television, urged colleagues not to flee, and pledged to stay on with his family. He spent about seven years as a economic adviser to Communist officials. He has written that he told them to "allow private enterprise," and left for Paris with the Government's permission when they ignored that advice.
In 1983 the State Department denied Mr. Hao a visa under a law aimed at "current or former Communists, anarchists or subversives." But the Government reversed itself the next year and issued Mr. Hao an immigrant visa. His daughter, Gina Nguyen, said he was now applying for citizenship.
Among the lore that surrounds Mr. Hao is his involvement in thwarting a plan by American and South Vietnamese officials to fly out the nation's gold reserves. His precise actions are disputed. But he may have enhanced his standing with the new Communist Government by taking credit for preserving the 16 tons of gold.
Mr. Hao left Vietnam for Paris in 1982 accompanied by his two daughters. His wife, Nguyet Thi Cao, had already moved to Houston, with their two sons. She appears in history books on her own as a well-known widow. Her first husband, Ba Cut, was a South Vietnamese militia leader captured and decapitated during a 1950's revolt.
 
Gone for a Month
 After being reunited in Houston, the Hao family moved to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where Mr. Hao has said he worked as an adviser to the Fund for Industrial Development, a branch of the Haitian Government that channels loans to expanding businesses. Ms. Nguyen, Mr. Hao's daughter, said the family moved to Coral Springs in 1987 because her father had heard good things about the schools.
Since then, she said, he has stayed at home while her mother has run a convenience store in North Lauderdale, Fla. She said he had been gone for about a month and she did not know where he was. "We don't communicate often," said Ms. Nguyen, who is 18 years old. "He's a strict man and I am afraid of him."
The family seems to be comfortable but not wealthy. Mr. Hao and his wife paid $208,000 for a house now assessed at $170,000, which has been for sale for about a year. Alcohol licensing records show they have invested $135,000 in the convenience store, with loans of $115,000.
Last summer, Mr. Hao began sending investors an amateurish plan to do business in Vietnam, describing himself, among other things, as having attended a program at a business school he misspelled as "Hardvard." But he was able to win an introduction to Mr. Brown, then one of the capital's top lawyer-lobbyists.
Mr. Brown's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, has said the meeting was arranged by a mutual friend, Marc Ashton, a Pompano Beach, Fla., businessman who has worked in Haiti. Mr. Weingarten said the men discussed potential business dealings in Vietnam but made no commitments. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Hao was on a plane to Hanoi, where he appears to have had access to top Vietnamese officials, including the prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, who he said gave him a letter for Mr. Brown.
 
Conflicting Versions
 What happened next is in sharp dispute. Mr. Weingarten has said that Mr. Brown glanced at the letter but told Mr. Hao at a December meeting that he could not work with him, since he had been nominated to be Commerce Secretary.
A conflicting version comes from Ly Thanh Binh, a businessman from Tamarac, Fla., who was acting as Mr. Hao's junior partner in the plan to seek investment in Vietnam.
He has told investigators that Mr. Hao returned from the December meeting reporting that Mr. Brown had asked for a $700,000 payment. Mr. Binh said Mr. Hao then went back to Vietnam and arranged for the Government to put the money in a Singapore bank.
Saying his sole motive is ethics, Mr. Binh has been trying to publicize this story since February, when he first notified news organizations. He was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and passed a lie-detector test, the bureau has said.
But he acknowledges that he has never met Mr. Brown and has no document suggesting that the Commerce Secretary sought or received money. His version of Mr. Brown's actions comes solely from Mr. Hao, who could have concocted a story to exploit his partners or Vietnamese officials.
The latest twist is the appearance of three letters sent anonymously to The Spotlight, which was the first English-language publication to print Mr. Binh's accusations. The Spotlight is distributed by the Liberty Lobby, a Washington group that has argued that the Holocaust did not occur.
The letters, purportedly from Mr. Hao, are written in Vietnamese and addressed to colleagues in Vietnam. They do not clearly confirm nor refute the accusation of bribery, though they seem to imply the F.B.I. is trying to coerce a false confession.
In a July 27 letter apparently to a Vietnamese official in Saigon, the author says, "I accept the sacrifice for the truth and to save the reputation of the 2 governments." The letters refer to a host of commercial and Government dealings with the Vietnamese and asks the authorities to "preserve my capital."
The letters are signed Nguyen Van Hao, on stationery that says "NVH Associates," with telephone numbers that Mr. Hao has used in Saigon and Washington. Mr. Binh has said the handwriting is Mr. Hao's.
The Spotlight sent the letters to the F.B.I. Mr. Hao's lawyer, James McGuirk, did not return telephone calls seeking to confirm their authenticity.

HEADLINE: Democrats Try Offense as Best Defense

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Signaling an unusually combative public posture for the Democrats, the party chairman, David Wilhelm, leveled a sweeping attack today on the gun lobby, the insurance lobby, the anti-tax lobby, the religious right and, of course, the Republican Party.
"The party of Bill Clinton is an aggressive and confident party, willing to confront its foes, ready to respond to attacks quickly and effectively," Mr. Wilhelm said here at the fall meeting of the Democratic National Committee. "And let's be very clear: our foes are not limited to members of the other political party; they are the people and institutions who will fight to maintain the status quo." 
 Mr. Wilhelm then took on several organizations that have opposed the Democratic Party on issues from health care to abortion: the Health Insurance Association of America, the National Rifle Association, the Christian Coalition, the Citizens for a Sound Economy and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bashing appears to be a shift for a party that has in the past been content to emphasize its difference with the Republicans. Mr. Wilhelm, stung by criticism earlier that the party was not active enough in fighting the opposition to the President's economic package, apparently does not want again to be accused of letting the party's opponents seize control of the debate.
 
Several Fronts at Once
 While the groups Mr. Wilhelm singled out have come under criticism from him before, today was the first time he opened such a broad attack on several foes at once.
"The N.R.A., the Christian Coalition, the H.I.A.A., and Citizens for a Sound Economy are some pretty tough customers," he said. "But if this party is to truly be the party of the people, the party of the public interest, then these are battles we're going to have to be willing to wage."
Mr. Wilhelm's biggest target was the Health Insurance Association of America, and for reinforcement in denouncing the group, he was joined by former Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio, who is running the drive to promote President Clinton's health care package.
As Democratic officials distributed the script of a new radio advertisement from the insurance group, Mr. Celeste attacked the spot point by point. Citing a sentence in the ad in which the announcer says, "The Government will set a limit on what everyone can spend for health care," Mr. Celeste accused the group of distortions and angrily declared, "That is flat wrong."
 
Health Alternative Criticized
 Mr. Celeste also denounced an alternative health plan proposed by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, that is backed by some Republicans and would require no employer contributions to insurance premiums. "At the heart of their proposal is a failure to meet the test that this health care will be always there," he said. "It isn't enough."
While the Democrats were busy lashing out at rivals, the two-day meeting was virtually devoid of its usual internal rancor. The one issue that divides the party the most, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was kept out of the public eye.
So Mr. Wilhelm saved his fire for others. The party, he said, was willing to go head to head with the National Rifle Association, especially in New Jersey, where Gov. Jim Florio has made gun control a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. "They can attack Jim Florio all they want," Mr. Wilhelm said, "and we'll just stand more proudly behind him.
"We're going to give small business a better deal on health care, but if the National Federal of Independent Business wants to fight it like they fought Medicare, we'll meet them in the middle of the ring. And we're going to fight for the values of tolerance and inclusion, and when the Christian Coalition impugns the values of our candidates, we'll call them on it."
And in a reference to a conservative group that opposed Mr. Clinton's economic plan, Mr. Wilhelm said, "We are going to continue to stand up for the economic interests of working Americans, and the attacks of big-money front groups like Citizens for a Sound Economy aren't going to stop us. Ever."
 
Words for Republicans
 Nor did Mr. Wilhelm neglect his party's traditional foe. He said Republican leaders "too often welcome extremists into their conventions and their precinct organizations, extremists who promote intolerance."
Haley Barbour, the Republican Party chairman, took issue with Mr. Wilhelm's remarks. "The Clinton people always try to attack some organization or bogy man instead of trying to promote their own ideas," he said in a telephone interview from his home in Mississippi.
Mr. Wilhelm said the party was concentrating on efforts where there was unity, particularly health care.
"Health care is our No. 1 priority of the Democratic National Committee, period," he said at a news conference, adding that the party expects to spend up to $3 million this year on efforts to push for health care.
Contending that passage of a health package would help both Democrats and Republicans at the expense of Ross Perot, Mr. Wilhelm said: "Ross Perot benefits from gridlock. Neither party benefits from gridlock."

HEADLINE: Easier Said Than Done;
Fragmented New Jersey Struggles to Cut Taxes

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
To understand the campaign arguments of Gov. Jim Florio and Christine Todd Whitman over state spending, the three adjacent Bergen County school districts of Allendale, Ho-Ho-Kus and Saddle River offer a telling lesson.
Their combined enrollments are only 1,400, about the size of a high school in some places. But their combined budgets add up to $15 million, as much as what a medium-sized city often spends for two or three times the number of students. 
 The three districts exemplify a fact of New Jersey's political life that rarely gets mentioned by political gladiators in an election year: the state's cherished system of highly fragmented local town and school district government makes budget cutting a highly complicated, and in some cases, futile exercise.
For the past two decades the system has been eating an ever-larger share of state money, and along with Federal health and welfare mandates and numerous other state subsidies, it now consumes fully two-thirds of the $15 billion that Trenton's tax collectors will take in this year.
 
Tough Place for Cutters
 Instead of becoming fat on its ever-growing budget increases -- as some tax protesters have complained -- New Jersey's central government share of total tax receipts has shrunk in recent years as the share of money for everything from keeping tickets on New Jersey Transit trains affordable to subsidizing the pensions of neighborhood school cafeteria workers has been increased.
So this fall, as Mrs. Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor, promises massive cuts in taxes, and Governor Florio speaks more vaguely of possible opportunities for tax reductions, they do so against the backdrop of a statewide fiscal system that has not been kind to the aspirations of budget-cutters.
"There has never been in this state a tax-cutting governor," said Carl E. Van Horn, acting director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers and a former director of policy planning for Mr. Florio. "Tom Kean raised taxes, Brendan Byrne raised taxes, Bill Cahill raised taxes, and they didn't do it because we have a bigger central state government, they did it because we have to transfer all those dollars to the towns and local governments."
This was vividly illustrated in the 1991 legislative elections, in which the Republicans won veto-proof majorities in both houses on their campaign pledge to roll back all of Mr. Florio's tax increases. Once in control, however, the Republican leadership calculated the fiscal and political impact of such a cut, and settled for repealing about a third of the Florio increase.
New Jersey has more school districts, 611 of them, than Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland combined, although those four states enroll three times as many pupils. Each district must have its own school board, superintendent and administration, all at considerable expense that the state is expected to help cover.
 
2d-Highest Property Taxes
 New Jerseyans pay for more police officers per capita than in any other state because so many municipalities want their own police forces. Most of the state's 571 municipalities have separate administrations, planning boards, and road-repair operations. Together, these agencies have helped win New Jersey the distinction as the state with the highest property taxes in the nation after New Hampshire, which has neither a state income tax nor a sales tax.
For political leaders in both parties, the all-absorbing task of the past decades has been to offset the state's reliance on property taxes, which are generally regarded as regressive, and to equalize the level and quality of services between rich and poor municipalities, said David Kehler, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey, a public policy think tank.
"It's an enormous challenge to any governor, how to control and how to equalize all this duplication in school districts, all this duplication in town governments, all this duplication in police, in school bus depots and everything else," Mr. Kehler said. "It's a tremendous burden for anyone in the statehouse."
He said Governor Florio's 1990 tax increase of nearly $3 billion was only a stopgap in the inexorably rising costs of an almost chaotic local government structure.
"It was a tremendous achievement and a necessary one," he said, "but it can't last -- we simply have too many governments."
 
$6 Billion for Education
 Indeed, the three small Bergen County districts with such a small enrollment and such large costs are considering consolidating with a fourth, Wallington, as an efficiency move that the state has encouraged. But the districts are asking Trenton to pay for the feasibility study.
The state's $15.8 billion budget for the current year breaks down like this: $6 billion for local schools and higher education in the state, $4 billion for human services, principally welfare, Medicaid and Medicare grants, a few million for capital and debt services, and the rest devoted to direct state services, the state departments, their employee salaries and benefits and the operation of parks, state police, and so on.
Most of the human services are mandated by Federal welfare, Medicaid and Medicare law. Any room for cuts would be on the order of discontinuing the state's policy of paying for eyeglasses for the needy, a minuscule fraction of overall costs.
The $4.5 billion in local aid to school districts, meanwhile, is known to legislators as a "third rail appropriation," which means, as Mr. Van Horn explained, "Touch it and you die." Any cut in state school spending would all but automatically produce a rise in local taxes, producing more inequality among rich and poor districts and more voter fury toward legislators at election time.
 
Defending Their Aid
 Also running through the budget are costs mandated by recent state initiatives, like tougher drug laws enacted under the Kean administration, and more recent mandatory sentencing laws.
In 1981, for example, there were 5,900 state-sentenced inmates in state and county prisons, at a cost to the state of $93 million. This year, there are 22,000 state-sentenced inmates, and the budget for jails has ballooned to $623 million. This year, the state has also agreed to take over the county court system, to the relief of local tax rolls but at an additional $100 million cost to the state budget.
Sprinkled throughout the three-inch thick budget are hundreds of budget items, large and small, that benefit different groups and constituencies, each fiercely protective of its aid and in all likelihood organized to defend it.
On page D-390 of the 1994 budget, for example, is the information that the 212,000 passengers who on an average day ride a New Jersey Transit train or bus pay an average of only $1.54 toward a trip that costs the authority $3.05 to provide. So this year, the taxpayers provide a $270 million subsidy. Any cut in subsidies raises ticket prices, reduces ridership, harms worker mobility and puts more cars on the road.
 
Cutbacks Hit Home
 Similarly, even though tuition, gifts and endowments contribute $479 million to the state university system, the state will still spend $227 million to keep the system running.
Richard Leone, now president of the Twentieth Century Fund, a Manhattan-based nonprofit public-policy research foundation, and chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was state treasurer during the Byrne administration, a time of wrenching budget cuts and tax increases. Cutting the budget "was one of the most punishing experiences I can recall," he said recently.
"I remember once being up in Bergen County trying to explain the cuts we were making," he said, "and a fellow got up and explained that he was dependent on dialysis and that the machine was paid for under such and such a program, and under my cuts they will have to turn off the machine and he will die, and would I please comment on that. It was a moment from budget cutting that I will never forget."
 
Room to Reduce Budget?
 Is there room to cut the budget further without wrecking the state or reaping a political whirlwind, as Mrs. Whitman insists? Mr. Kehler and others say yes, but whether the slack in the budget amounts to the $1.15 billion over three years that she has set for herself is uncertain.
There is still, the experts say, some overstaffing left over from the rapid growth of state government in the 1980's, when revenues soared with the economy and the size of the state budget more than doubled, from $5.7 billion when Mr. Kean entered office in 1982 to $12.1 billion in 1990, when he left.
In that time, the number of central government employees increased from 58,000 to 71,000, and although Governor Florio and the Republican-controlled Legislature expect to have reduced that figure to 61,000 by the end of next summer, many believe further cuts are possible.

HEADLINE: OLD RIVALS BATTLE IN GREEK ELECTION

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATHENS, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The banners are furled. The campaigning is done. The bullhorns have blessedly fallen silent.
All that remains for Greek voters to do in elections on Sunday is to deliver what the pollsters insist will be one of Europe's most remarkable political resurrections: the revival and reinstatement of Andreas Papandreou. 
Remember him?
Mr. Papandreou was the Greek Socialist leader of the 1980's who tweaked the United States' tail over the American military presence here, consorted with the likes of the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, and infuriated his European Community partners with his profligate spending of their money.
 
Once Seemed Doomed
 The problem child of the NATO alliance, Mr. Papandreou seemed doomed by disgrace, ill health and a disastrous record when, in April 1990, Greece's eight million voters last dusted off the ballot boxes in the cradle of democracy to elect Constantine Mitsotakis, a conservative, as Prime Minister.
At that time, Mr. Papandreou was conducting an openly adulterous relationship with Dimitra Liana, a flight attendant half his age who is now his wife, faced grave corruption charges, seemed debilitated by open-heart surgery in 1988 and, after nine years in office, had left Greeks saddled with the European Community's biggest debts.
Some were tempted to write him off altogether. But now, on the eve of the election, his party, the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, is running a clear six percentage points ahead of Mr Mitsotakis's New Democracy in public opinion surveys.
If that margin is maintained in the voting booths, it will be enough to give Mr. Papandreou a whopping majority in the 300-seat Parliament under election legislation introduced by Mr. Mitsotakis to favor the front-runner.
While there may still be some slippage, many Greeks seem to be taking Mr. Papandreou's victory as virtually assured, and not necessarily because they like him.
 
Voting Against, Not For
 "In Greece, people vote to oust someone, not to install someone," said Photis Photopoulos, a central Athens travel agent of conservative inclination.
The prime reason voters have turned against Mr. Mitsotakis, many Greeks say, is the economic austerity program through which he sought to pay off the debts and untangle the economic mess inherited from Mr. Papandreou. The program has hurt Greeks in their businesses and their pocketbooks.
"The market is dead," said Nicolas Continis, a businessman. "Gas has gone up. Rents have doubled. New Democracy blew it. The people who are voting for Papandreou are all hoping that he'll spread some money around again."
In some ways, it has been a campaign of titanic proportions. Spectators have been offered the vision of two 74-year-old men slugging out the last battle of a personal feud that has overshadowed Greek politics since Mr. Mitsotakis broke with Mr. Papandreou's father, Prime Minister George Papandreou, in 1965 in what the Papandreou camp still terms "the betrayal."
For Mr. Mitsotakis, the campaign is supposedly his last shot at power: if he loses, he has said, he will quit, an assertion that not everybody believes.
For Mr. Papandreou, the vote provides probably a last chance to vindicate himself after all the tribulations: corruption charges that he narrowly avoided when a panel of judges voted 7 to 6 to acquit him in January 1992; accusations of quixotic mismanagement of the Greek economy, the European Community's poorest, and the sense that age and ill health had consigned him to history's has-beens.
By many accounts, the campaign has been a grubby one. Mr. Mitsotakis's television advertising, orchestrated by American advisers including James Carville of President Clinton's campaign, has gone so far as to suggest that in voting for Mr. Papandreou, Greeks would be voting for a dying man.
 
A Conspiracy Theory
 Naturally, the campaign would not be complete without a nefarious conspiracy, this time centering on the billion-dollar business of Greece's vast, inefficient but potentially lucrative state telephone corporation.
Mr. Mitsotakis offered a 35 per cent stake and management rights to six foreign bidders to pursue his drive for privatization and economic renewal, offending Greek tycoons with their own interest in the telephone corporation.
So, as the unsubstantiated theory goes in Mr. Mitsotakis's campaigning, and in the coffee shops of Kolonaki Square where loose talk is as much the point as the beverage, the businessmen decided to bring him down, using their control of influential newspapers and radio stations to discredit him, and fanning the flames of revolt in New Democracy.
All good conspiracy theories need a clinching argument. In this case, Mr. Papandreou has already provided it: he has said that if he is elected, he will not sell the telephone corporation to the foreigners. Greek interests, thus, would be protected, and, for some, the conspiracy theory proved beyond all doubt.
"It is difficult to rule," Mr. Mitsotakis said, "when you're being stabbed in the back with a stiletto, or a pack of stilettos."

HEADLINE: Paul Clifford, 82, Mathematician Who Focused on Quality Control

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Paul C. Clifford, a professor of mathematics and a pioneer in the use of statistical equations for industrial quality control, died Wednesday at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. He was 82 and lived in Montclair, N.J.
The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, his family said. 
 Mr. Clifford was a professor of mathematics for 41 years at Montclair State College, where he was chairman of the mathematics department for several years.
 
Application of Statistics
 But he was best known for his application of statistics to manufacturing, which he began to advocate during World War II when he worked for the Wright Aeronautical Company in Paterson, N.J. His methods were used as a way to reduce the number of flaws in airplane parts and make their production more efficient.
In 1952, he took a leave from Montclair State College and, at the request of the United Nations, traveled to India, teaching industries there how to use statistical controls. From 1954 to 1955, he taught the same methods in France for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which was formed under the Marshall Plan. He also worked for the U.N. and for the United States Agency for International Development in Spain, Mexico and Peru.
 
Taught on Television
 Throughout his career, he was employed as a consultant by several automakers and lectured on quality control with W. Edwards Deming, the noted management theorist. In 1965, the American Society for Quality Control presented Mr. Clifford with its highest award.
From 1961 to 1962, he also taught college-level math on Sunday mornings on the NBC-TV series, "Continental Classroom."
Mr. Clifford was born in Bismark, N.D., and was educated at Columbia University, where he received a bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics.
He is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Katherine Corbett; two daughters, Joanne and Catherine of Manhattan; five sons, Denis of Berkeley, Calif., Steven of Seattle, Gregory and Douglas of Manhattan and Justin of Santa Monica, Calif., and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Nicholas Kisburg, 78, a Lobbyist For Teamsters and a Social Critic

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Nicholas M. Kisburg, a longtime lobbyist for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in New York and a sharp critic of the city's welfare system in the late 1960's and the 1970's, died on Monday at a nursing home in Penobscot, Maine. He was 78 and had lived in Blue Hill, Me., since retiring in 1979.
He died in his sleep due to complications from emphysema, said his wife, Anne. 
 Mr. Kisburg, who never attended college, was a self-taught economist and statistician who used his post as legislative director of Teamsters Joint Council 16 in New York for nearly two decades as a platform to advocate economic and political change in the city and the state.
A rough-hewn, acerbic speaker, he was frequently at odds with Mayor John V. Lindsay's administration over what he said was an unfair crackdown on welfare recipients after years of lax enforcement of eligibility rules.
For several years, Mr. Kisburg compiled statistical studies of the changes in the welfare rolls and advocated methods to ease the city's burden, such as longer jail sentences for fathers who abandoned their families and more effective drug treatment programs.
In 1969, he was appointed to an unpaid post as a consultant to City Council President Francis X. Smith on antipoverty and welfare matters.
He did not limit his concerns to welfare. He was also a frequent critic of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and was consulted by political leaders on issues ranging from higher education to law enforcement.
In 1977, he became embroiled in a feud with Gov. Hugh L. Carey after he said Mr. Carey was largely to blame for the state's remaining in a recession, because he was a "part-time Governor" who spent too much time at P. J. Clarke's bar in Manhattan and other nightspots. The Governor denied that he was neglecting his duties, but said he would stop socializing in public. Mr. Kisburg later apologized for the tone of his remarks.
Mr. Kisburg was born in Brooklyn and started his career as a longshoreman in Manhattan before going to work for the International Jewelry Workers' Union Local 8 in 1958. The union merged with Teamsters Local 210 in the early 1960's and Mr. Kisburg did statistical research for the local from 1959 to 1961, when he joined the Teamsters Joint Council 16, which had more than 150,000 members.
While working for the Teamsters, he also taught economics part time as an adjunct assistant professor at Fordham University.
He is survived by his wife, Anne, and by a sister, Jocelyn Vince of Queens.

Watson Fulfills Dream With Astros Job

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Major league baseball needs one commissioner and two league presidents. Last week the league lost a good candidate to replace Bill White as National League president.
"That's way, way down on the priority list now," said Bob Watson, who had aspired to the league job. "This is something that was a dream. The National League job was not a dream. I wanted the opportunity, and now I have the opportunity to put together a winner for a team I started with way back in 1965. Now it's my team, and I have a chance to take it to the next level." 
 Watson, like White a former major league first baseman, is the new general manager of the Houston Astros, replacing the dismissed Bill Wood, whom he had served as assistant general manager for five years. Drayton McLane, the Astros' owner, also fired Manager Art Howe.
"It was a bittersweet thing," said Watson, 47. "My two friends got the ax. That's the only downer in this thing. I was hoping Bill Wood would be considered for president of the club and I would move in, but that didn't happen."
It is no surprise that Watson got the job. He was an impressive person as a player, and he has a fertile mind filled with ideas on how to improve baseball's product. That's why he had been an attractive candidate for the league position. But now he is the major leagues' only black general manager, a status he is proud of but prefers to put into perspective.
"In my opinion," Watson said, "this is a tremendous step for baseball, for the Houston Astros and for Bob Watson. It's something the minority population can point to now and say, yes, there is a black man, or a minority person in a decision-making role for a major league club. But I don't want to be categorized as a pioneer. I want to be categorized as a guy who was the right man for the job, a guy who had the experience, a guy who played at every level of baseball, a guy who coached, a guy who also spent five years as an assistant G.M. and was qualified for the position."
Watson credited several people with helping him reach his new position but especially John McMullen, the Astros' former owner, who hired him in 1988.
"Doctor Mac gave me the opportunity," he said. "If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be general manager today."
 
Torborg Not a Cubs Candidate
 When speculation began during the season that Jim Lefebvre might not be back next year as the Chicago Cubs' manager, a name mentioned most prominently as his possible successor was Jeff Torborg. The thinking made sense because Torborg managed the Chicago White Sox when Larry Himes was their general manager.
Himes, who as the Cubs' general manager fired Lefebvre last week, confirmed his strong feeling for Torborg, but he also said Torborg was not a candidate for the job.
"I'm going on the assumption I'm going to be able to fill this job from the inside," Himes said. "That's my preference. We've already interviewed Tony Muser and Tom Treblehorn. I like Jeff. If I wasn't looking inside, he'd be right at the top of the list of candidates."
Torborg, for his part, said he has sat out long enough. "I'm ready to go back to work in a second," he said, having been unemployed, though lucratively so, since the Mets fired him in May. "Given my awful experience with the Mets, I have this gnawing need in my stomach to straighten out that mess. I had that all summer long."
Torborg said he and his wife, Suzie, were in Texas last month for the Rangers' tribute to Nolan Ryan, whose first no-hitter he caught in 1973 while with the California Angels. "We were sitting in the stands," he related, "and Suzie said, 'You're not enjoying this, are you?' I said no."
Even if the Cubs' job is out, Torborg is on Bob Watson's list of candidates to consider for the Astros' vacancy.
 
Aiming for Three-Baggers
 Some players talk about trying to hit home runs in certain situations. Lance Johnson tries to hit triples.
"I'll try to hit them every once in a while," the Chicago White Sox center fielder said. How does he do that? "You just swing as hard as you can and hope to hit them where they're not, and you get a triple sometimes," he explained. "I tried to hit one the other night, but I couldn't. I hit a deep fly ball."
Johnson has been successful so often that he has matched a major league record by leading the American League in triples each of the past three seasons, reaching a career-high 14 this season while hitting .311. Showing that much more than 90 feet separates a triple from a home run, Johnson hit no home runs in 540 at-bats during the season, giving him the distinction of batting most often without hitting a home run. Frank Thomas, his teammate, hit 41 home runs in only nine more at-bats.
"That doesn't bother me at all," said the 160-pound Johnson, who hit three home runs last year. "I'm not supposed to hit home runs. If I were hitting home runs, I'd be making $6 million. I'd be a complete player. I hit a lot of home runs in batting practice. It's not in my best interests to hit home runs in games. If I did, I'd hit 8 to 10 home runs and hit .190 or .200. I wouldn't be playing this game in a couple of years."
Johnson, however, will not leave 1993 without hitting a home run. He drove a two-run shot over the right-field fence in the second inning against Todd Stottlemyre in last night's playoff game against Toronto. But he did not abandon his primary weapon. Batting against Stottlemyre in the sixth inning, he lashed a two-run triple.

Stop the World, They Want to Get On

BYLINE: By ALEX YANNIS

 BODY:
The marathon that started 18 months ago with 141 nations seeking to qualify for the 1994 World Cup reaches a crucial stage this week, starting with games today that will determine two of the 24 finalists in the quadrennial competition, to be played in the United States next summer.
Two of the three finalists from Africa will be decided this afternoon, when Zambia visits Morocco and Cameroon plays host to Zimbabwe. Nigeria qualified Friday. Its 1-1 tie with Algeria in Algiers enabled Nigeria to edge out the Ivory Coast on goal differential. 
 The Zambian team has captured the fancy of the world with a team rebuilt from the ashes of a plane crash off Gabon April 28 that wiped out its original squad. The plane crashed into the sea en route to the team's first qualifying match.
 
Hopes of a Nation
 Four European-based players, who missed that fatal flight, now form the nucleus of a Zambian team whose success has breathed hope into a nation battered by an economic crisis and political uncertainty. The Zambians need only a draw on Sunday against Morocco to qualify for their first World Cup.
"We are almost there," said coach Freddie Mwila. "We have come too far to fail now."
Those left behind in Zambia are taking no chances. Last week, president Frederick Chilumba suggested that his fellow citizens spend the day before the match fasting and praying in a show of support.
The Zambian team will have to cope with a talented, defensive-minded Moroccan side and at least 90,000 fans are expected to crowd the seats and stairwells of the mammoth, sold-out stadium at the Mohammed V sports complex in Casablanca.
The Moroccans lost, 2-1, to Zambia in Lusaka last July, but the Moroccans have a new coach, Abdellah Blinda, who has healed damaged relations with several stars based overseas. If Blinda's players can pull together on Sunday and win, they, not the Zambians, will be the ones making travel plans to the United States, for Morocco's third trip to the finals.
In Asia, six nations -- Japan, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, South Korea and Saudi Arabia -- will begin a 20-day round-robin tournament in Doha, Qatar on Friday. The 15-match tournament that ends Oct. 28 will send two representatives to the United States.
Of special political significance will be matches between Iran and Iraq on Oct. 22, Saudi Arabia and Iraq on Oct. 24 and the encounter between North and South Korea on the last day of the tournament.
Ten of the 12 spots allocated to Europe are still open from the field of 36 entrants that were divided into six groups. Only the two countries from Group 5, Greece and Russia, have qualified for the United States. Both countries got a break in qualifying after FIFA, soccer's world governing body, banned Yugoslavia.
Eleven matches in the European groups will be played Wednesday. A number of the games can be seen on closed circuit television throughout North America. In Group 1, four teams are still in contention for the two spots and they play each other on Wednesday. Switzerland, which leads the group, visits Portugal and Scotland plays in Italy. The Italians are 1 point behind Switzerland.
In England's Group 2 match at the Netherlands, both teams desperately need a victory to stay close to Norway, which leads the group and can pull away with a victory in Poland.
Four teams are challenging for two spots in Group 3, with Ireland having the edge and Northern Ireland the most difficult task. Ireland plays host to Spain and Northern Ireland travels to Denmark.
Group 4 also has four teams challenging for the two spots, with Belgium, which visits Romania, having a 3-point edge in the group. The other match in that group finds Cyprus, which has already been eliminated, playing in Wales. The Representation of Czechs and Slovaks, the other challenger, does not play this week.
Three teams (France, Sweden and Bulgaria) are in contention in Group 6, the only group with all its teams in action this week. France can clinch a spot with a victory over visiting Israel. Austria at Bulgaria and Finland at Sweden are the other two matches.
Brazil, which clinched its spot with a victory over Uruguay, is the only country to participate in the final stage of every World Cup tournament since 1930. Bolivia and Colombia have already joined Brazil as the representatives from South America.
Argentina has a home-and-home playoff with Australia, the winner in Oceania, to determine another finalist. The first game will be played in Sydney, Australia, Oct. 31; the return game is in Buenos Aires Nov. 17.

HEADLINE: A Cautionary Tale

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Worry Time for Wall Street?" (Sept. 26), one of the featured sources, Hancock Institutional Equity Services technical analyst Justin Mamis, said of Money magazine's advice to small investors, "[Money] has told them it's a long bull market and don't worry about corrections." 
In fact, as our readers know, the opposite is true: Money has consistently warned of a potentially severe stock market correction since the spring. In our March issue, Money senior editor and chief forecaster Michael Sivy wrote, "The market could keep setting record highs through midyear, with the Dow industrials topping 3,600. But then it could retreat all the way to 3,000 late in '93." If rising inflation causes interest rates to surge, he added, "investors will get walloped by Christmas. Stocks could plunge 15 percent or more and long-term bond prices would fall by at least 9 percent."
We have issued similar warnings every month since, citing factors from the preponderance of overvalued issues to the four-year "Presidential cycle," which portends a 10 percent to 15 percent correction that could have begun as soon as August. Thus, we have cautioned readers time and again to stay conservative, unloading tenuous winners and buying only bargain-priced stocks with strong potential.

HEADLINE: The Case for the Defense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Reforms in the legal profession are constantly under way and many have already been in place for a decade or more. For example, our medical malpractice laws in New York were changed in 1985. As far as consumers are concerned, they were not changed for the better. Now meritorious cases against incompetent physicians are rejected because lawyers and clients cannot afford the expenses involved in litigating these matters. Naturally, doctors and their insurance companies are pleased because court filings have gone way down. Insurance companies have not, however, reduced their rates or their profits. Lawyers suffered substantial losses of income and consumers are left with injuries and no remedies. 
 It's always interesting to read of doctors complaining about their hardships. I have never met a poor doctor. On the other hand, I have met a great many poor and even unemployed lawyers. Lawyers have already swallowed the bitter pills of so-called "reform" initiated by the medical and insurance lobbies. Now it's time for doctors to take their own medicine.

HEADLINE: Haiti: Mission Impossible?

 BODY:
On Thursday 600 American soldiers were supposed to leave for Haiti to help arrange the transition from military rule to the installation of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Their departure was delayed because a nervous Pentagon wanted "clarification" of their mission.
The objections, according to a state Department spokesman, have either been answered or overruled, and troops are now on their way, due to arrive in Port-au-Prince tomorrow. That's a pity, because their mission, in its present form, will not work. 
 The Americans are ostensibly going to Haiti to help "train" or "professionalize" Haiti's military. As the mission now stands, they will be lightly armed, if armed at all, and will not constitute a peacekeeping force. But the people they are supposed to be helping have no wish to be trained.
They are the same thugs who denied Father Aristide the presidency he won in the country's first democratic elections, who expelled him from the country two years ago and who have terrorized Haiti ever since. Last week they brutally enforced a general strike meant to sabotage the transition to democratic rule.
They have recently murdered one of the president's leading supporters, dragging him from a church service and shooting him in the street. They have made it clear to members of his government that if they show up at the office, they may pay with their lives.
Last summer, with his country weakened by international economic sanctions, the leader of the Haitian junta, Raoul Cedras, agreed to a timetable for returning Father Aristide to power. The sanctions were lifted accordingly. But military leaders, especially the Port-au-Prince police chief, Joseph Michel Francois, have openly defied the agreement.
For most of this century Haiti has been ruled by a corrupt, wealthy elite, bolstered by a brutal military clique with long paramilitary tentacles. Since the election of Father Aristide, U.S. policy makers have consistently underestimated the resolve of this clique, and its willingness to resort to brutality.
Chastened by Somalia, Americans might be tempted simply to leave Haitians to sort out their own affairs. But unlike the Somalis, the Haitians have already elected a government; they simply lack the muscle to bring it back home. And Haiti is close; its refugees end up on our shores, or drowning in nearby seas.
Still, defenseless U.S. troops should not have been sent into this snake pit. America has better ways to show its resolve. The first is to reimpose the sanctions that were lifted last summer, and ask fellow members of the U.N. to do likewise. Then the Clinton Administration should reassess what it wants to accomplish in Haiti, and how.
As an island nation, Haiti is susceptible to naval blockade, an option that would stop short of massive military intervention but might help force the return of democracy.
General Cedras has reneged on his bargain; he and his cronies cannot be trusted with American lives.

HEADLINE: Does Coverage Polarize Elections?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Clinton Hits a Nerve on Race," (editorial, Sept. 30) highlights the tendency of voters to follow racial lines in biracial contests, often in response to campaign rhetoric. But you ignore how the mass media's poll-driven, horse-race coverage of elections may exacerbate this tendency. 
 In a study of New York Times coverage of the 1989 New York mayoral race, we found that three-quarters of campaign-related articles contained at least one paragraph mentioning "race," "white" or "black." Many days, there was substantial coverage (more than 20 paragraphs) referring to race or ethnicity. This increased toward Election Day.
About one-third of these articles contained at least one reference to polls and candidate standing. Of these, one in five contained a reference to white voters and one in seven to black voters. By the end of the campaign, virtually every article contained a reference to candidate standing and racial preferences.
Similar coverage returned last spring with "New York's Blacks Back Dinkins, but Whites Don't, Poll Indicates" (news article, May 19) The article reported "deep cleavage along racial lines" and predicted that the Mayor "has consolidated his support slightly among white voters who may have feared that he would favor blacks if elected." Mayor Dinkins's advantage is attributed to his "cast-iron support among black voters."
The results of our continuing study echo an analysis of a recent mayoral vote in Chicago: campaign coverage typically deals with race and ethnicity not as substantive social concerns but as matters of practical electioneering -- buttons to push to get out the vote. That social and economic differences might underlie what appears on the surface to be racial or partisanship division is not reflected in the polls or the articles, most of which focus simplistically on race as a source of political conflict. (The same could be said, incidentally, about gender.)
The well-documented phenomenon of the shrinking of white support for minority candidates as Election Day draws near suggests that news coverage emphasizing racial conflict can activate negative racial attitudes and stereotypes among white voters. Clearly, some whites are moved to alter their preferences. The undecided may shift in disproportionate numbers to support a white candidate. And those who had made up their minds but weren't motivated to go to the polls may be stimulated to vote in unusually large numbers.
Aside from the havoc these behaviors create for pollsters, they beg the question of whether or not the media focus on racial conflict, rather than group identity, may undermine your call to "elect the next Mayor on his merits."

HEADLINE: Economics 401

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
Baseball owners seem unable to reach agreement on sharing local media revenue. According to Murray Chass ("Owners Circle Bases But Don't Score," The Times, Sept. 7), lawsuits have been threatened by the high-revenue clubs, and the owners' chief labor executive says, "Everyone is acting pretty much in their own self-interest."
One of the reasons that revenue sharing in major league baseball is controversial is the lack of agreement on the financial success of the teams. Owners continually cry poverty, but the amounts that teams sell for suggest financial success. In my view, all major league baseball teams are financially successful and revenue sharing is superfluous to this nonexistent problem. 
 The most recent supporting fact is the $173 million bid for the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles were last sold to Eli Jacobs in 1988 for $70 million. Thus, Jacobs realized an annual compound growth rate of 19.8 percent in the value of his team -- a healthy capital gain by most standards. And the Orioles are not an isolated case.
There is a second side to the revenue-sharing debate -- the argument that it will promote a more equal distribution of playing talent between the teams and thus promote greater competitive balance between the teams. But revenue sharing will not alter the distribution of star players between large- and small-market teams. If the businessmen who own the teams are primarily interested in profits, then their salary bids for players will primarily reflect the ability of those players to generate ticket revenues for the team.
Star players will still generate more revenue in big cities because there are more fans and more news media. So big city teams will still get the lion's share of the star players via trades and via the free-agent market. In the long run, large-market teams will win more whether or not there is revenue sharing. But well-managed teams in small markets can expect to be in the pennant race with some regularity.
My conclusion: The probable reason for the stalemate among the owners is that revenue sharing will have no positive impact on major league baseball at this time. In the absence of any common good, is it any wonder that owners act in their own self interest?

HEADLINE: Subdivisions for Houston's Ghostly Business Parks

BYLINE: By LETTICE STUART

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
WHEN Julie and Michael Marczak bought a home in a new subdivision in northwest Houston last year, they didn't think of themselves as pioneers. But they were among the first home buyers in one of several new residential communities sprouting up around Houston in underdeveloped business parks.
The Marczaks -- he is an electrical engineer, she an elementary school music teacher -- said location was a top priority when they began house-hunting last year. 
 With a 16-month-old daughter and another baby due in March, the 34-year-old couple had outgrown their small house closer to downtown, but realized that a move up would mean a move farther from their jobs. They were acutely aware that each moment wasted in snarled traffic is time away from home and family. So when they happened upon Crossroads Park at Route 290 and Eldridge Road, they were impressed by the location.
"It was kind of scary being one of the first buyers," Mrs. Marczak said. But the mix of commercial and residential use is not unlike many Houston neighborhoods because of the city's lack of zoning laws, she said.
The Marczaks say their additional 15 to 18 mile commute to work is somewhat offset by the ability to get on the Route 290 freeway in five minutes rather than 15 to 20 minutes that it takes residents of many subdivisions. They do concede that there will be increased traffic congestion when the remaining commercial tracts are developed.
According to a survey by CDS Research Inc., a Houston-based real estate marketing research and consulting firm, more than half the space in 14 business parks already have been or are being converted to residential use. The subdivision at Crossroads Park was one of the first. "It's a trend that makes sense and one that we will see more of," said Pamela A. Minich, vice president of CDS.
It is a simple case of supply and demand. Too many business parks were developed in the late 1970' and early 80's when the city's economy was booming, but now commercial demand has slowed almost to a standstill. With about half of the 26,750 acres in 140 business parks still vacant, land owners are slowly realizing that if they want to sell, residential conversion may be the only answer, Ms. Minich said.
But it is a tough realization. According to a Houston land broker, Stan Creech, commercial land in a suburban business park sells for $2.50 to $3.50 a square foot, but its value drops to 50 cents to $1.50 a square foot when converted to one-family residential.
Residential developers benefit by getting land with costly roads, utilities and drainage in place. Home buyers benefit because business parks typically are built at prime locations near major freeways.
The 266-acre Crossroads Park was developed in 1983 as a multi-use park by Trendmaker Development Company, a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser Corporation, a forest-products conglomerate based in Tacoma, Wash.
Millions of dollars were spent putting in streets, utilities and drainage to accommodate the office buildings, retail development, and hotel envisioned on the site. But the timing was bad. The project opened just as Houston's oil-based economy began to crater. A few highway frontage parcels sold to small commercial establishments, but the dream of bigger things never materialized.
In 1991, Trendmaker decided to do something with the idle land, said Robert J. Bamford 3d, the project manager. Setting aside some large tracts for commercial use, Trendmaker carved out 98 acres for single-family homes, installed parameter fences, and built a 1.4-acre recreation center with a swimming pool. The first residents moved into the new community in August 1992.
"THE location took some of the risk out of it, but the conversion was still a crapshoot because of the public's concern over the vacant commercial tracts," Mr. Bamford said. But now with 114 of the 317 lots sold and 84 houses already built, Trendmaker considers the conversion a success and already is planning another.
According to Mr. Bamford, 92 acres in Parkview will be converted to residential use in 1994. The 173-acre business park at Interstate 10 and Barker-Cypress Road in West Houston was also developed by Trendmaker in 1983. Two three-story office buildings, one of which houses Trendmaker's headquarters, are the only commercial structures on the property. Land fronting on I-10 will be reserved for commercial use, Mr. Bamford said.
While Trendmaker is converting land it already owns, other residential developers are buying up business park land for conversion.
Sueba U.S.A. Corporation is developing Parkway Villages, a 464-lot master-plan community, on 215 acres of land that was part of a failed business park in West Houston. Home prices will range from $200,000 to $800,000, according to the sales manager, Michael W. Baldwin. A total of 43 homes has been completed and sold since February.
The development is a joint venture of Sueba U.S.A., which is a subsidiary of a West German-based construction company, and Hypo Bank of Munich.
SUEBA has built two shopping centers and 1,200 apartments in Houston since coming into the city 10 years ago, but Parkway Villages is the company's first single-family-home development.
The property was part of a 563-acre business park developed 10 years ago by several Houston businessmen at a cost of about $70 million, according to John W. H. Chiang, vice president of Sueba U.S.A.
At that time oil companies were locating their headquarters nearby along I-10 in an area now known as the Energy Corridor, and the developers anticipated that such large-scale development would spill over to the parkway. But nothing was ever built there.
"The conversion of business park land to single-family use is a real plus for the city," said Mr. Creech, whose brokerage firm assembled the Parkway Villages parcels for Sueba. "In West Houston alone, there are thousands of acres with utilities in place that won't be used for anything else for a long time," he said.
But Mr. Creech doesn't see the danger of too many conversions and a replay of the overbuilding that occurred with business parks 10 years ago.
"The difference," he said, "is that money was loose then and it's tight now."

THIRTEEN years ago, Everett L. James Jr. began operating his White Plains company, E. J. Excavating, out of a one-room office in his home, with little more than a pickup truck to his name. At the time, he said, he was low on capital and high on pluck.
Today, after steering the business through several ups and downs, Mr. James has a larger office, 10 full-time employees and a fleet of equipment. On the whole, the ledger looks healthier, but his spirit is flagging. "I'm beat," the 50-year-old entrepreneur said. "I think I've lived through every obstacle a black businessman could come up against. I've been fighting for a long, long time." 
 Bitterly recalling banks that refused him a loan despite his solid credit rating and white contractors who assumed he was a worker and not the owner of equipment being brought on a job, Mr. James said, "You name it, I've seen it. Being black hasn't made it exactly easy."
 
Increased Bidding Competition
 The lackluster economy in recent years has left many small businesses fighting to stay afloat, but for minority-owned enterprises like Mr. James's, the struggle has been that much harder, county and state officials said.
One of the problems is that large white-owned contractors are bidding on jobs "that in good times they wouldn't touch," making it more difficult for smaller, less-established companies to compete, said Lynn G. Canton, director of business development for minorities and women of the State Department of Economic Development.
Also, in the wake of United States Supreme Court rulings that questioned the legality of "set-asides" -- Government contracts that are earmarked for businesses owned by blacks, women and Hispanic people -- many in such groups have fared poorly, the officials said.
To address the problem, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke signed an order late last month strengthening Westchester's efforts to increase the number of companies owned by minorities and women that do business with government agencies.
"We want to give them an equal place at the starting line," Mr. O'Rourke said. "We are not guaranteeing a place at the finish, but we are saying we need to reach out to them."
Mr. James's worry is that the County Executive's order is too little too late. Many of Mr. James's trucks stand idle these days and the phone no longer rings off the hook, although he concedes that that is a problem both blacks and whites face today in the construction industry.
 
Seeking a Level Playing Field
 Only if the executive order "has some teeth to it," Mr. James said, will it afford him at least a fighting chance to compete for county bids.
"I'm skeptical, but I haven't given up all hope," said Mr. James, who was a member of the County's African-American Advisory Board and a president of the now-defunct Westchester Minority Contractors Association. "Basically, what we are asking for is a level playing field."
Mr. O'Rourke's order requires the County Office of Economic Development, the Office for Women and the Office of Affirmative Action to develop seminars and informational guides to teach women and minority entrepreneurs about public bidding and procurement requirements -- which he referred to as "the morass of government regulations."
The executive order also calls for the three offices to develop a list of businesses owned by members of minorities and by women in Westchester. The list would identify suppliers and contractors by product, service and capability for county departments and outside contractors.
Moreover, the order establishes a purchasing review committee to monitor and report on companies owned by members of minorities and women that gain contracts with or supply equipment to the county. The panel conducting the study of possible disparity is to include a black, a Hispanic and a female business owner in addition to county officials, the order says.
If the committee finds a pattern of discrimination and if it documents disproportionate numbers of businesses owned by white men gaining government contracts, then the county could institute a remedial policy, like set-asides, in accordance with Supreme Court rulings.
An earlier executive order specified giving 10 percent of the county's business to minority firms. That order was dropped after the court's first ruling on set-asides.
In June, the Supreme Court ruled that white contractors could sue to challenge Federal programs that set aside some public-works contracts for minority-owned businesses. The decision reinstated a Constitutional challenge brought by a group of white contractors to a minority set-aside ordinance in Jacksonville, Fla.
 
A Limit Placed on Set-Asides
 In 1989, the Supreme Court cast doubt on Government hiring and contract programs to aid minorities by striking down a set-aside measure in Richmond, which channeled 30 percent of public works to minority-owned concerns. That case was brought by a white-owned mechanical plumbing and heating contractor, the J. A. Crosson Company, which lost a bid to supply toilets for the city's jail.
The Supreme Court said that set-asides were justified only if they served the "compelling state interest" of redressing "identifiable discrimination" by the governments or private parties.
In New York, a study released in August last year by the State Department of Economic Development showed that without guidelines and goals, a "clear pattern of discrimination" existed in the awarding of state bids to contractors and vendors, said a department spokesman, Bern Rotman.
To address the problem, the state is building a vendor base of firms owned by women and minorities, publishing a directory of those firms and setting mandatory goals for increasing their participation, Mr. Rotman said. For example, a large nonminority contractor winning a bid may be required to use some minority and female subcontractors.
 
Awards to the Lowest Bidder
 While the state seeks to remedy minority discrimination in the awarding of bids by setting mandatory goals, New York City uses a system of price preference, giving contracts to minority firms that bid within a certain cost range. That policy, however, is being challenged in a Federal lawsuit filed by a white-owned Mount Vernon company, Halmar Corporation, which lost out on a contract to a joint-venture partnership that included a woman, even though that firm's bid was 5.5 percent higher.
Westchester will wait until its disparity study is completed before deciding which policy, if any, to follow. For now, all contracts go to the lowest bidder. Some critics say that that allows larger white-owned companies to low-ball a contract and edge out smaller minority competitors.
Representatives of black and Hispanic groups who had lobbied for Mr. O'Rourke's new executive order said they were pleased by the county's latest effort to help minority companies.
Luis Andrew Penichet, chairman of the 16-member Westchester County Hispanic Advisory Board and a White Plains lawyer, observed that the county's Hispanic population had almost doubled from 1980 to 1990 -- to 86,194 from 45,566 -- generating an increase in bodegas, dining establishments, travel agencies and taxi companies run by Hispanic entrepreneurs.
 
The County's Figures
 "The big issue is helping them to get going," Mr. Penichet said. "It's not a matter of opening up a lemonade stand on the corner and saying, 'Come on in.' They need to know how to get financing, how to bid for contracts, how to deal with a bank."
According to the county's most recent figures, the number of Hispanic-owned businesses in Westchester grew sixfold from 1977 to 1987, to 1,644 firms from 229, with sales and receipts of $96.2 million by 1987. Most of those companies offered business, personal or health services, although retail, transportation and construction concerns made up one-third of the Hispanic-owned businesses.
In the same 10-year period, black-owned businesses doubled to 2,311, representing sales and receipts of $121.4 million by 1987. Although most were in service-related fields, about 10 percent of the black-owned businesses were transportation and trucking companies, and another 10 percent were retail enterprises.
J. T. Childs Jr., chairman of the 22-member Westchester County African-American Advisory Board, said the County Executive's plan to monitor awarding of contracts to determine if discrimination exists is one of the most important parts of the order.
 
A Lack of Success Stories
 "There are lots of government contracts, but the question is the ability of minorities to compete and win," said Mr. Childs, who is also director of the work-force diversity program for International Business Machines in Purchase.
The number of blacks in the county grew to 120,195 in 1990, from 104,815 a decade before, and they now represent about 13 percent of Westchester's population. But Mr. Childs said that blacks also represent 68 percent of the county's prison population, and that "there are not a sufficient number of success stories" and thriving entrepreneurs who can serve as "good role models for others to follow."
Figures for businesses owned by women showed some of the strongest growth of any of the groups. In a five-year period -- 1982 to 1987 -- the latest years for which figures are available, there was a 69 percent increase to 19,250 businesses owned by women in the county; nationally, the number of businesses owned by women jumped 50 percent in that time. Most such businesses in Westchester, which represented sales and receipts of $2.2 billion in 1987, were service oriented, with business-related services and health services predominating, according to figures from the County Office of Economic Development. Finance, insurance and real estate firms owned by women followed a distant second, the office said.
Businesses owned by Asians and members of other minority groups doubled to 1,751 over the five-year period, with sales of $168.4 million. Most Asian businesses are concentrated in health services, followed by food stores and restaurants.
 
Not the Only Answer
 Most minority business owners interviewed, like Mr. James, were at worst skeptical and at best hopeful that the new county effort would bear fruit for them.
But Armando Rodriguez, co-owner of the Latin American Cafe, a Cuban restaurant in White Plains, and of A&A Maintenance U.S.A., a janitorial service in Elmsford, cautioned other business owners like himself not to view the executive order as the only answer.
"Just because they are going to assist minorities doesn't mean we don't have to be competent," he said. "This is not the road to riches, but it is a help."
Mr. Rodriguez, 30, left Cuba when he was 4 and now works with his father, Armando Rodriguez Sr., in the building-maintenance business, and with his uncle, Orlando Rodriguez, at the Latin American Cafe.

 BODY:
ONE DAY LAST MAY, MY SON'S thirdgrade classroom was left in the care of a substitute teacher. For reasons still undetermined, a small riot broke out, with children fighting, shrieking and shoving chairs. Nine-year-olds going berserk in springtime is not unprecedented, but consider what happened next: The new principal lectured them with a sternness they were unaccustomed to. Then she made them write letters of apology and then they fell apart all over again. Those who claimed they had not participated in the brawl came down at dismissal time tearful and incensed at the burden of collective guilt imposed upon them. "Isn't it illegal for her to punish those of us who did nothing?" one boy asked his mother. "Should we sue her?" asked another. When told they should show more respect for authority, one girl said, "Why should we respect her when she showed no respect for us?"
In the office of a child therapist recently, a 10-year-old girl leaned back and gazed at her mother with half-lidded contempt. The child was there because her divorced parents couldn't do anything with her. Her father was bitter because he had brought her along to buy his girlfriend an engagement gift and she had sulked the whole time. Her mother complained that she refused to make friends with the mother's boyfriend. "How do you expect me to have a relationship with him," the girl said with the ennui of a 40-year-old, "when he's always in your bedroom?" 
 The therapist shook her head when she recounted the visit: "Sometimes I think I'm too old-fashioned to practice in today's world. Half the time the children act like adults and the adults behave like children."
FOR DECADES NOW, CHILDREN HAVE been growing up faster and faster, each new generation emerging more precocious than the last. But today's crop of under-12's, particularly in middle- and upper-middle-income families and particularly in urban America, seems to have reinvented -- or even bypassed -- childhood as we knew it. They are proud, independent and strong-willed; they are worldly-wise and morally serious. They are a generation that has been raised to challenge and doubt authority, to take little at face value -- in short, to enter the world of maturity long before they are mature.
This was no accident. The parents of many of these children -- those of us who began our families later in life -- came of age in the Vietnam War years. Our ideas of child rearing were like our ideas about everything else: radically different from our parents, who thought a child was just a child, even when the child got old enough to march against wars and otherwise protest the way the elder generation ran the world. Those of us who were veterans of the 60's and 70's swore that we would treat our children with respect. We vowed that we would fold our own offspring into our daily lives, treating them like "little people," empowering them with the rights, the importance and the truth telling we had been denied. We wanted to create the children we always yearned to be. And now, many years later, we are confronted with the results. Did it turn out the way we meant it to? Will our independent children thank us for making them the center of the universe, or have we robbed them of a childhood they can never regain?
The explosion in communications -- with television and movies thrusting sophisticated material on grade-schoolers -- as well as increasing competition for college placement has intensified childhood burnout. The kid of yesterday, who wandered in meadows of fantasy, whose tears were reserved for skinned knees and broken toys, has given way to the kid who is strapped to the competitive fast track before he is out of diapers. The urban, affluent child is crammed with gymnastics and tennis and French lessons and then is crowded with even more activities by working parents who try to make the most of the time they have with their children. The child who could once be seen playing cops and robbers in the park is no longer even in the park but at home simulating the same thing on his Nintendo screen. He is a computer whiz, a little philosopher, a tiny lawyer, bursting with opinions on the President, on the best museums, the best vacation spots and the college he thinks he will attend.
For childish comfort, he is taken into the capricious arms of television: the great cuddly dinosaur Barney leads him in singing "we're a happy family" and then the child switches the channel to see that the man who taught him tennis is a pedophile who has put a bullet through his brain. Language more appropriate to teen-agers can be heard in elementary-school halls. One mother of a 7-year-old confided that a boy had told her daughter, "You're so yucky you must have sex with Nazis."
Economic hardship has long stolen childhood from the poor. The severity and the causes of their problems, which have only intensified, are far different from those of affluent children. Yet for the first time, these more privileged children are thrust unshielded into the middle of family crises that would paralyze an adult: a parent is dying of AIDS or the child is a mediator in violent dramas of drug addiction or divorce.
Even in stable families, small children with two working parents learn to shift for themselves, cooking and caring for siblings and picking up the attitudes of their elders. Our generation -- reared in an era in which sex was not discussed, conflict was suppressed and emotional distance was maintained -- opened the gates for our children. But each day, the bleak river of honesty that runs through their lives grows dangerously higher.
"I was determined that there were going to be no more scary secrets, no more J. Edgar Hoover, when I got to be a parent; everything was going to be up front," says Marcia Roesch, a school admissions coordinator. "I talked and talked, but I wasn't listening and I wasn't keeping a sense of balance and appropriateness with my children. I hear parents all the time asking their kids 'Is that O.K.?' as though they need their kids to approve every decision."
Says Candace Stern, a New Jersey mother of an 8-year-old: "I used to express my insecurities and everything else to my daughter. One day, we were watching a takeoff of Little Red Riding Hood on Sesame Street and I thought it was hilarious. Then I looked at Caitlin and she was terrified. It was then that I realized that I didn't really know what was in her mind and that what she heard, what she held onto, was much different than what I, an adult, retained."
CONTRARY TO OUR assumptions, we have found that children are much more than little people. They are the possessors of rather eccentric states of mind that some experts fear are being altered by the early use of computers and other technology.
"There is a period of childhood, until about age 9, when children should exist in a dreamlike state," says Kay J. Hoffman, an educator at a progressive school in Rockland County in New York. "Instead, they are being hardened too early, jarred into an awake adult consciousness that is preventing the natural development of their imaginations. The trend to intellectualize early education is a dangerous one. I see more children with high anxiety levels and learning problems caused by the enormous pressure that is being put on them to think and speak like adults before they are ready."
Highly verbal children will use words, without really understanding them, as coin of the adult realm. "They use them for protection, to push away their own experience as children," says one doctor who asked not to be identified to protect his patients. "One 4-year-old that I tested kept running out of the room saying he had to go get his 'concentration.' He couldn't just be a child and say, 'I don't want to do this test!.' He had to parrot an adult concept that he hardly understood because he was afraid to disappoint me."
I think sometimes we cannot know how profound that fear runs in our children, especially since we have burdened them with such a sense of their own importance. At times, their officiousness seems to be bluff; they simply cannot afford to be wrong. In making them feel so trusted and believed, we have not only bridged the generation gap, we might have overlapped it. As we hover over their development as though we were tending orchids in a greenhouse, are we not also guilty of a kind of neglect? In integrating them into our daily lives, have we taken away their freedom to do childish things? Parents or nannies of old stayed at home and babbled and played games; we take them to department stores, to work, to lunch, to movies and plays. Parents push for intimacy so much that one child was overheard telling her mother, "If you say I can have my feelings one more time, I'm going to throw up."
Says Miriam Siffert, a grandmother in Manhattan: "We sent our children to the most progressive schools, but they knew their place. They knew their time. We didn't take them to dinner parties or on trips to Europe. But I see my grandchildren taking over the house, taking over adult conversation."
Peggy Rosenblatt, a mother of two, concurs: "There is so much familiarity and so little distance. We tell them where we are going, what we are doing. We ask their opinion as though they were our best buddies, and then we are surprised when we tell a 10-year-old to do something he doesn't want to do and he says, 'You can't make me.' "
So uncomfortable are we with being in authority that we have made a crusade of elevating our children at the expense of ourselves. Consider the way we portray ourselves in children's movies: no Mary Poppins or Clark Kent these days; instead, enter Hook, so realistically evil that he breaks the bounds of old-time fantasy, or an all-too-believable Mom and Dad who keep leaving their son home alone.
"Sometimes it seems like there is no bottom line anymore," says Sara Adler, a grade-school teacher for 20 years. "I have some kids who yell 'child abuse' if you discipline them. They know tag lines, but they don't know the lines they cannot and should not cross. The parents think, 'What are the teachers doing!' And the teachers wonder what is going on inside of the homes."
We have abrogated the moral authority our parents wore as easily as gloves. In Westchester County in New York, for instance, where kids in their early teens come into the city to party until the early hours of the morning, some parents are afraid to give their children curfews for fear they will move out and live with a friend.
Even children themselves think that things sometimes go too far. "Trust me, I know some kids who are guilty of parent abuse," Jonathan Stein, 10, says. "They feel like they own their parents and that they could just take all their parents' money out of their bank account and run away if they wanted."
Michelle Denburg, a high-school senior, adds: "Some of my teachers were afraid to be authority figures. They couldn't control their class and partly it was the fault of the parents because they would say negative stuff about a teacher and then expect their kids to respect those teachers."
IN SPITE OF THE CONFUSION THESE children experience, few would disagree that they are, in many ways, a splendid generation. My son, Joshua, 9, and his friends are amazing in their generosity, sensitivity, ability to stretch across an intellectual canyon and meet adults on their own terms. They have highly developed senses of justice and fairness, rejecting stereotypes and embracing oddities in their peers, whether a hair style or a disability. They are disdainful of smoking and drug use, can sniff out hypocrisy and have social consciences that are poignant. They are so worried about the few trees on their block that last year they formed an earth club to keep them free of litter. At times, the child in our children pokes endearingly through the veneer of sophistication. "Mom, please don't buy Ivory soap anymore" was his most recent environmental request. "Why?" I asked. "Because they shoot elephants to get the ivory, don't they?" he replied.
Paul Shechtman, a New York lawyer, reports that when he argued with his daughter, 6, about going to school with a rip in the knee of her jeans, she asked him for one good reason why she shouldn't wear them. "Because my father never would have let me," he said, exasperated. "Just because your father made a mistake," she replied, "why should you?"
"At that moment," Shechtman said, "I knew that I had succeeded as a parent. Now, of course, I do have to live with my success."
Helene Stein, mother of three children 14 and under, including Jonathan, says she gets "a kind of wicked pleasure when I compare my children's childhood with my own." She and her sister had to be bathed, with hair brushed and bathrobes on, before they came to the table. "My parents were the ones who spoke," she says. "We listened. With my kids, I drop everything if they seem to want to talk."
SINCE THE END OF the Victorian era, when children emerged as entities that could be heard as well as occasionally seen, childhood has been considered increasingly precious. Members of my generation, however, gave new definition to the cult of child worship. When I was pregnant, one friend teased me for turning my apartment upside down and buying a king-size bed (big enough for three): "You'd think you were preparing for the arrival of Caesar." After Josh was born, I filled notebooks recording his every wiggle. And my husband insisted on carrying him in a sling on his hip virtually everywhere, including to cocktail parties, where, to everyone's horror, he let him sip beer. Not being able to recall one of my pictures ever gracing my mother's refrigerator door, I later hung his drawings of little people manning complicated machines up and down the hallway. One day, when 4, he smiled indulgently and said, "Mom, you'd think our house was the Metropolitan Museum of Joshua!"
Some parents applaud both the acceleration and involvement of today's children in the real world. A librarian expressed disbelief when a third-grader asked for books on the Holocaust. "We read those books together," his mother, Carol Saper, explains, "and we talk about them. I think it has made my son a more sensitive, caring person."
Nearly all parents, however, feel their best efforts are continually subverted by television. Much of the time, exhausted, overextended parents are caught unawares. "I'm a working mother and I move mountains to organize everything just right -- we even manage to eat dinner together, but there's always some crack for the kids to fall through," says Susan Mascitelli, a hospital administrator who has a son, 9, and a daughter, 3. "The kids leave the table early and my husband and I finally have 10 minutes of peace and then suddenly I hear the kids howling with laughter at "Married With Children," about a couple that hates each other and a child who acts like a hooker. The fact that they even understand this disgusting program stuns me."
Last year, one school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan held parent meetings to discuss a fourth grade whose girls were so sexually precocious that they were hotly pursuing certain boys and refusing to speak to others. "The last straw was when one child invited kids to his home for a dating party when his parents were out," says Ann Beaton, who has children aged 10, 7 and 1. "The kids' parents just delivered them with no questions asked. The girls wore halter tops and tiny bicycle shorts. It's hard to know whether they just wanted to look like Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman" or whether they knew what they were up to."
Some parents complain that the culture has sexualized children long before they desired it. One third-grader, asked to list questions she had during a sex education course, replied, "Why do we have to know about stuff like this?"
Dr. Richard A. Gardner, a child psychiatrist and author who has recently been outspoken in his defense of adults he thinks have been falsely accused of sex abuse, believes that although these crimes do exist, the country is undergoing a wave of sex abuse hysteria: "When I was a child, I had a book about having a fun day with Uncle Ralph. Now, Uncle Ralph is depicted as the kind of guy who, as soon as Mom goes into the kitchen, has his hand in your pants." Gardner says that data show the proliferation of early childhood sex abuse prevention programs are creating confusion and anxiety in youngsters and he predicts those programs will also result in sexual inhibition, mistrust and even long-term sexual dysfunction.
Schools and parents alike have begun taking steps to address these problems. Stephen M. Clement, the headmaster of a boys school in Manhattan, for instance, imposes strict order on the older boys who set standards of behavior for the younger ones: "One of our boys walked in bleeding -- he had been mugged for his baseball cap. A school must try to provide a safe haven and some better models."
At Kay Hoffman's school in Rockland, teachers make unilateral decisions for young children so that they will have a good inventory of adult choices on which to base their own decisions later on. "We try to slow children down," Hoffman says. "We don't barrage them all at once. Learning evolves out of their own experience." The school also advises parents to ban television and not to talk about current events. "As soon as I did that, my child began to relax and act like a little girl again," says Candace Stern, whose daughter attends the school. "Her uncle was in Desert Storm and we didn't even tell her he had gone to Jidda until after it was all over. When we finally told her that he had been in a war, she asked, 'What side was he on?' "
Some worry about the repercussions of this generation's having lost its fleeting chance to be a child. "A person who does not have the opportunity to move through the stages of childhood at his own pace ends up with something missing," Jill Comins, a family therapist, says. "As an adult, he will search endlessly for it. He will experience powerful and regressive tugs backward."
Others, however, predict success. "I've been watching these kids grow up, grade by grade," says Gardner P. Dunnan, headmaster of a coeducational school on the Upper East Side. "They have had so much openness, so many opportunities, such a great arena to learn and grow, by the time they are adults they will be wonderful individuals and citizens."
Perhaps our children are simply rebelling against their parents much earlier than we did. And perhaps that means that they won't have to do it later. Perhaps our children will grow up to be the kind of people who wouldn't dream of inventing the motto "Never Trust Anybody Over 30."
"I feel they are in transition," says Sara Lebar, who lives in Greenwich Village. "We changed the rules and we have to expect them to react. I think that the next stage will be that our kids will be our friends, in a way we never were to our parents. Allison may not give me the respect I gave my mother, but I never aspired to be like my parents. And already Allison wants to be an environmentalist just like me."
FOR THOSE OF US who love our wonderful strong-willed children just the way they are -- or almost just the way they are -- there is a move afoot to readjust certain things ever so slightly. One day not long ago, having asked my own son several times to straighten out his room -- which could not be penetrated because of a string that crisscrossed from wall to wall in some obscure scientific experiment -- and having received no reply to this apparently trivial request, my voice became significantly louder. He finally looked up. "I'm not comfortable with cleaning out my room right now," he said.
"Get comfortable," I replied.
"Why?" he gazed at me.
"Because," I said, startled, as out of my mouth tumbled words that could have been taken out of a balloon in a comic strip of the 60's, "you are a child and I am the mother. You do not have the right to tell me what to do. On the other hand, I have the right to tell you what to do as long as you live under my roof."
First he gave me a withering look. Then he thought about it for a minute. And then he said "O.K." and headed for his room.

TRAVELS WITH LIZBETH
By Lars Eighner.
271 pp. New York:
St. Martin's Press. $19.95. 
 FROM Jack London to Ted Conover, authors of firsthand reports from the world of destitution have nearly all been amateur paupers, visiting the foreign land of poverty much as other adventurous writers have taken off for Patagonia or the Hindu Kush. London began "The People of the Abyss" (1903) with the story about how his cabdriver had been reluctant to take him to the slums: " 'See here!' I thundered. 'Drive me down to the East End, and at once!' " To pass as a street person, London bought old clothes at a Whitechapel slopshop and sewed a gold sovereign into his long johns for emergencies. In "Down and Out in Paris and London" (1933), George Orwell trades his respectable suit for "some dirty-looking rags" and is at once accepted into the sodality of the underclass. In Mr. Conover's "Rolling Nowhere" (1984), his first stop is a charity store, where he purchases $5 worth of threadbare duds, before going on to the bank to pick up his traveler's checks.
The great exception to these investigative costume dramas has been, until now, W. H. Davies's "Autobiography of a Super-Tramp" (1908). Davies did not ride into vagrancy by taxi. He was a thief and a drunk who attributed his weakness for the bottle to his having been born in a South Wales pub. He was a tramp for a dozen years in the United States, Canada and Britain, and his book describes how he lived rough, rode the rails, sold bootlaces, "griddled" (sang pathetic hymns outside the houses of the well-to-do), ground knives, "downrighted" (begged) and stole. Jumping a freight train in Ottawa, he lost his right leg. All this while, he also wrote poems.
The poems eventually saved him from homelessness. He sent a self-published book to George Bernard Shaw, who provided Davies with a blurb and tipped off the literary editors. In 1905, a squad of Fleet Street feature writers made their way down to the South London doss house where Davies was quartered, and turned the 34-year-old tramp into an overnight celebrity. He died in 1940, a rubicund old lion with a young wife, a huge circle of admirers and a secure place in the anthologies. Some of his poems ("What is this life if, full of care, / We have no time to stand and stare") will be familiar to people who cannot place his name.
"Travels With Lizbeth" is a modern autobiography of a supertramp. For Lars Eighner, homelessness was until very recently a full-time job, as it was for Davies, and this book takes us into the profound depths of that other country that lies all around us on the streets. In lavish, patient detail, it re-creates the grammar, point of view and domestic economy of the unhoused life, and if there's any justice in the world it should guarantee its author a roof over his head for the rest of his days.
IN the mid-1980's, Mr. Eighner, who had no college degree, was working as an attendant at what he calls "the state lunatic asylum" in Austin, Tex., when he quarreled with his supervisor and lost his job. Passing effortlessly through the wide mesh of the welfare system, he was soon evicted from his rented shack. With his dog, Lizbeth, he camped out on the floors of friends' apartments, and when his welcome ran out he slept in parks and on roadsides, foraging for food in Dumpsters. For three years he zigzagged between Austin and Los Angeles; a fat, fortyish hitchhiker in badly torn jeans with a dog, for whom few of us would have stopped on the hard shoulder. This wasn't Robert Louis Stevenson with his donkey or John Steinbeck with Charley: Mr. Eighner and Lizbeth's "travels" restore the word to its roots in travail and trepalium, the triple-staked torture of the Inquisition.
Mr. Eighner wasn't wholly destitute. He was a writer, successful in his field -- erotic stories for gay magazines. Some of his fiction is collected in "Bayou Boy" (Badboy Books/Masquerade): Ring Lardner-like vernacular stories in which the guys have sex instead of playing baseball. The craftsmanship of the writing far outweighs its pornographic element: Mr. Eighner's hard-boiled, streetwise voices ring fluently true; the contingent urban details are cannily observed; the body-to-body stuff is skippable. But the magazines for which these tales were written paid little and paid late: 3 cents a word, about $75 a story. The world of the gay fictioneer is a grim new New Grub Street.
Though his writing kept his pride alive, it earned far too little to house him or save him from the Dumpsters. As writers must, he watched himself living, and saw that his life lay outside the reach of conventional narrative: "A homeless life has no story line. It is a pointless circular rambling about the stage that can be brought to happy conclusion only by a deus ex machina." In "Travels With Lizbeth," Mr. Eighner's voice and form are as strikingly unconventional as the life they conjure.
The Dumpsters hold the key to Mr. Eighner's weird prose style. As he fishes in the garbage for pizzas, discarded shower curtains, half-full jars of peanut butter, so he scavenges the wastebins of literature for old words and phrases that can be dusted off and used again. He describes himself, with a Pickwickian flourish, as "uncommonly stout." Or: "As I was finding no romantic or sexual prospects in Hollywood, I might have thought to send for Tim if I had secured an independent situation." His writing is peppered with expressions like "to wit," "to boot," "tarry," "vicissitudinous." "The driver was in Western attire. . . . But his clothes in spite of many washings acknowledged no recent acquaintance with hard work."
These linguistic glad rags are like Charlie Chaplin's bowler hat and tail coat, and Mr. Eighner wears them with deadpan irony. On the street, words were his only wealth and only weapons, but they didn't do him much good. Hospitalized with phlebitis, he had an argument with a doctor and paraded outside the hospital with a placard reading "DR. STALIN DENIES PATIENTS' RIGHTS" on one side and "DEMAND TO READ YOUR CHART" on the other. "I did not attract much attention," he reports.
Squatting in a vacant building, he achieved the coveted privilege of a mailing address: "I managed to register to vote -- and the registration stood up to a challenge from an old political enemy -- but though I wrote the Secretary of Commerce I could not get counted by the census of 1990." Cranky and obstreperous, Mr. Eighner can make the reader feel a quiet sympathy for Dr. Stalin, and there are passages in the book that read as if they were penned in the minute, intricately tangled handwriting favored by people who pester strangers with paranoid hard-luck stories. Yet Mr. Eighner's is a complex voice -- by turns grandiloquent and simple, alienating and compelling. He has the rounded presence of a character in fiction: a quare fellow; an original.
THE world he re-creates in his book is an unfailingly strange one. Time works differently there. Weeks on end go absent without leave from Mr. Eighner's memory, while a nightmare 24 hours are spent on a miserable odyssey through the suburbs of Tucson, trying to find a store that will pay cash for a $4.40 book of postage stamps. George Bernard Shaw, in his preface to "The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp," professed astonishment at how Davies could lose his leg "with no more to-do than a lobster loses a claw or a lizard his tail. . . . If such a thing happened to me, I should begin the chapter describing it with 'I now come to the event which altered the whole course of my life and blighted, etc., etc.' "
But lives like Lars Eighner's and W. H. Davies's do not proceed along compass courses, and there is no measuring of degrees of deviation from the settled norm. So the uncashed book of stamps looms like a tragedy, and a lost leg gets registered as a minor inconvenience. "Travels With Lizbeth" is full of these abrupt distortions of scale: when a lover exhausts his patience, Mr. Eighner remarks matter-of-factly, "I decided that as soon as I could think of a way of disposing the body I would have to kill Tim."
In fact, he doesn't murder Tim because, like everyone else in the book, Tim vanishes from the story on a whim. No sooner is a human connection made than it is lost. Each of the drivers who stop for Lars and Lizbeth -- a predictably rum bunch of psychotics, thieves, drunks and born-again Samaritans -- swells into a major character, then dwindles to a fading dot on the horizon. And so it is with Mr. Eighner's lovers, friends and fellow street people. The one sure thing about them is that they will shortly disappear, and their exits make for handy chapter endings: "I did not look back at Dallas." "After a while I saw [Don] no more." "Daniel did not return and I assume he went to Houston."
MR. EIGHNER'S companion on the road is oddly hard to see in sharp focus. Lizbeth's four legs and tender paws support a continuously shifting cargo of needs and apprehensions. Now hunger, now fear, now cold, now pain, now infantile playfulness, now moody sorrow, she is the protean self, utterly given over to the desire of the moment; Mr. Eighner's own dog's life, trudging beside him. Nor is the reader the only one to be puzzled by Lizbeth's indefinite physical presence: early in the book, she is described as mostly Labrador retriever; some pages later, she is mistaken, in good light, and by several observers, for a pit bull.
To both man and dog, people are evanescent creatures, and not to be relied upon. Things, by contrast, have a powerful characterly weight in Mr. Eighner's story. He can make one see and smell the tumbled innards of a Dumpster, where "every grain of rice seems to be a maggot"; he shows one the sickly yellow color of a $10 bill found in the desert, the glaze of a doughnut that urban bees "harvest," the cardboard pallet, the hot cinders underfoot. Objects stir his imagination more profoundly than humans do, and he's at his best when breathing new life into some old piece of junk found on the street. Near a sorority house, he comes across a mess of yarn. He needs a sweater for the coming winter, and so: "I made a circular knitting pin of a length of television cable and the point guards of two ball-point pens. . . . While I knitted I liked to imagine I was knitting while the heads of yuppies rolled past my feet."
"The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp" was in part a how-to manual, with W. H. Davies expertly advising the reader on the relative merits of hymn singing and bootlace selling as means of subsistence; and so is "Travels With Lizbeth." Lars Eighner teaches you how to go Dumpster diving -- though you also may grow uncommonly stout if you live on his diet of pizzas, ice cream and funny-looking chocolate. ("Chocolate is often discarded only because it has become discolored as the cocoa butter de-emulsified," which leaves one less than reassured.) And sometimes Dumpsters yield entire new lives. The castoff uniform of a maintenance man or a hospital worker will give you the free run of an institution packed solid with goodies for the taking. Mr. Eighner writes of homeless people masquerading successfully, for long periods of time, as janitors, students, nurses and college professors, just as Jack London & Company passed themselves off as members of the underclass by dressing up in rags.
This book, written on an XT personal computer found in a Dumpster, is the surprising last chapter of its own story. Its partial serial publication, in The Threepenny Review, The Utne Reader, Harper's Magazine and "The Pushcart Prize XVII," has already given Mr. Eighner a new life as the kind of
serious writer who receives lengthy and respectful reviews in The New York Times Book Review. It's a stunning twist of fortune -- but entirely in keeping with Lars Eighner's story so far. He has fished out his own life from the bottom of the Dumpster, shaken it free of rice grains, sponged off the egg yolks and revealed it to be the life of a successful author in good working order.
 
 
 
'I LOVE MY DOG'
 She loves human attention and like Browning's duchess she is pleased indiscriminately whencesoever it comes. In this she frustrates herself because she seeks attention by barking in a way that people who know little of dogs interpret as threatening. . . . The relationship between me and Lizbeth is that of man and dog. That I have made some sacrifices to avoid abandoning her or having her put to death in her youth seems to me entirely within the proper scheme of the relationship of man and dog -- my proper performance under an ancient interspecies contract.
Lizbeth had her disadvantages. I could not go some places with her. Usually I had no safe place to leave her. Individuals and institutions who might have helped me alone could not consider the two of us. She is not an especially bright dog, and even so I regret not having trained her to the extent of her abilities in her youth. I often averted disaster only by anticipating her behavior, which is to say, I suppose, she has trained me. I was never confronted with a choice between Lizbeth and some permanent, significant advantage. I might have given her up to obtain a few days' lodging here or there, but then I would have been back on the streets without the advantages of having her. I do not mind admitting that I love my dog. But anyone who has had to sleep by the side of the road in some wild place may appreciate that an extra pair of keen ears, a good nose and sharp teeth on a loud, ferocious ally of unquestionable loyalty have a certain value that transcends mere sentiment. If she did not save my life, and I am not so sure she did not, she did prove herself worth having many times over. My loyalty to her may seem touching to some people, and others may take it as evidence of my irrationality, but it always had, too, the aspect of preserving a valuable asset.
 From "Travels With Lizbeth."
 
 
 
ORTS FOR BREAKFAST, ORTS FOR LUNCH. . . .
 "It costs money to lose weight," Lars Eighner said, explaining the ins and outs of his waistline over the past six years. Mr. Eighner is still poor, almost as poor as he was when he was writing "Travels With Lizbeth," and he is still "uncommonly stout," carrying, the author says, 360 pounds on his 6-foot-3-inch frame. "It costs money to diet, to buy water-packed tuna instead of doughnuts," he explained in a telephone interview from an apartment he is now sharing in Austin, Tex.
Still, there was a time during his travels, in July 1989, when he had a little money and decided to diet. "Actually, I just didn't eat at all -- it was starvation." Thus the dust jacket of his book shows an almost wispy man, with narrow shoulders and skinny arms. "But if you saw the full frame," he said, "you would see that even then I was pear-shaped."
Though Mr. Eighner was usually hungry, he was never at a loss for words, living on "orts," for example, or food scraps, a 15th-century word from the Dutch that he says is current in south Texas. While on the road and dining (if that's the word) from Dumpsters, he tried to sell his gay erotica.
Mr. Eighner, 44, grew up in Houston and majored in ethnic studies at the University of Texas, Austin, for three years before dropping out to work in a drug-crisis program and later as an attendant in a mental hospital. A policy dispute led to his departure. He could not find another job and fell behind on his rent, and his sexuality had already alienated him from his family, so he and Lizbeth, a sort of Labrador, ended up on the street.
After working in what he calls a "lunatic asylum" and living on the streets, he has sharp words for a system that supplies food stamps only to those with kitchens, effectively denying help to the poorest -- those without kitchens. He has a plan to aid the poor: "We could fire every social worker in the country."

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREYBULL, Wyo., Oct. 7

 BODY:
At high noon in a crook of the Bighorn Mountains, the sorrel danced nervously inside the corral, as a lanky cowboy moved in to start breaking the colt, a practice as old as the Old West.
But this cowboy wore no spurs on his boots. He did not bark at the horse to show who was boss. He did not sneak around to throw a saddle on its back to climb aboard until it stopped bucking. Instead, he offered an outstretched hand, let the horse sniff it, and then gently stroked its neck and back. 
 "It's O.K., son," the blue-eyed cowboy, Tim Flitner, whispered to the bronc. "You're hard as a rock, I know, 'cause you don't trust me yet. But it's O.K."
 
Trying to Be Friends
 In perhaps the biggest cultural change on ranches since the automobile, a new generation of cowboys is forsaking the traditional rough style of breaking horses in favor of "gentling" the colts, a method that shares more with the tenets of Zen philosophy than John Wayne bravado.
"You need to go to where the horse is mentally," said Mr. Flitner, 29, a fourth-generation cowboy on a cattle ranch west of Red Gulch Road here. "You want to become his partner, his friend."
In the rugged mythology of the American West, there is no symbol more powerful than the tough cowboy astride a wildly bucking horse, an image emblazoned in blue silhouette on the Wyoming license plate and honored at every Saturday afternoon rodeo.
And not everybody is eager to see the old rituals vanish. The gentler method of breaking horses has raised the skeptical eyebrows of some crusty ranchers, who say it sounds more befitting a New Age flower child than a snuff-chewing cowboy.
Dennis Reis, a 35-year-old former rodeo cowboy who conducts workshops and produces videotapes on the new method, said most people "learned from grandpa -- and if it was good enough for grandpa, it's good enough for me."
"My buddies think I've gone off the deep end," said Mr. Reis, who incorporates yoga into his horsemanship. "They say, 'Dennis, you're a cowboy! What's with all this touchy-feely stuff?' And I know how they feel. I had to give myself a 'macho-ectomy.'
"But I tell them: it's a lot less work."
Proponents of the gentler method say it is also much safer than the traditional way of breaking horses, where the frightened colts, who naturally resist being ridden, often respond with flying hooves and bared teeth, as they buck furiously or try to ram a rider into a fence. Every year, more than 50,000 people are injured in horse-related accidents, including about 200 who die, says Dr. Doris Bixby Hammett, the secretary for the American Medical Equestrian Association, which focuses on safety.
"A 'real man' might not do it this way," she said. "But a smart one will."
The new method is still not as common as the old style, but has grown mightily in recent years, says Dave Pauli, a director of the Humane Society in the Northern Rockies.
 
Book Brings Trend
 "We think this is just wonderful," he said. "It's going to be generations before the old way dies out. But in the under-40 crowd, we've seen quite a change in the last five years."
Natural horsemanship, as it is sometimes called, became a hot topic around the stables after the publication of a book, "True Unity: Willing Communication Between Horse and Human" (Pioneer Publishing, Fresno, Calif., 1987).
The author, Tom Dorrance, an 83-year-old former rancher, said the method probably went "back as far as there were horses," but had never been widely used.
One of eight children on a family ranch in northeastern Oregon, Mr. Dorrance said he "learned the importance of cooperation" early. And as a small man -- he did not weigh 130 pounds until he reached his 30's -- he said he realized that he could not rely on brawn to get his way, but instead needed to communicate with the horses.
 
Understanding Horse's Fears
 "I'm a person who wants to get along, who doesn't like to see trouble, whether it's in the Middle East or out in the pasture," Mr. Dorrance said. "And it bothered me the way people tried to force themselves on a horse tried to dominate them."
His teachings have prompted scores of other horse experts to produce videotapes, workshops and brochures. Some younger cowboys call him "the patron saint of horses;" others have dubbed him "the horse's lawyer."
"I wasn't out for fame or fortune," said Mr. Dorrance, who lives in a mobile home in Gustine, Calif. "My wife and I just like to get outside, be around the animals, where life is real."
Central to gentle horsemanship is the understanding of the instinctive fear that horses have for humans.
"We are predators," Mr. Reis said. "We have eyes in the middle of our head, and we smell like McDonalds. Horses are prey. They have eyes on the sides of the head and they smell like grass."
 
Meeting Halfway
 Mr. Reis, who recently wrote about the method in the magazine, Horse Illustrated, advised that trainers should use a round pen, which keeps the horse close but gives it a sense of being free, since the animal can run in circles. Since there are no corners, the horse will not feel trapped.
In approaching the horse, the trainer should use the "universal horsemanship handshake," by extending a palm downward to simulate a horse's nose.
"Allow the horse to meet you halfway," he said. "Let it be its idea to touch or sniff your hand."
The trainer should gently rub the horse's forehead, he said, to demonstrate that touching feels good. He recommends using the coiled halter and lead rope to brush the hide, so the horse associates them with pleasure. If the horse flinches at the touch on certain parts, the trainer should return to a more comfortable spot, then slowly work back. When changing sides on the horse, the trainer should "politely let the horse know," using words and a gesture.
"Horses are herd animals, they're looking for a leader," he said. "If you holler at the horse, or whip it, he'll think you're a bully. If you sneak around, he'll think you're a wimp. And he has no reason to follow or trust anybody like that."
Mr. Reis said he could sometimes take a wild mustang and be riding it in three hours. But he does not force the issue. "You've got to stop thinking in people time and start thinking in horse time," he said. "And you have to stop trying to make the horse do something, and instead cause it to do something."
When he climbs in the saddle, he does not kick the horse to start it, but simply leans forward and "lets it feel the energy moving forward."
Each time he gets off, he tells the horse, "Thank you for the ride."
Mr. Reis, who alludes to "Zen masters" in discussing his approach, said he seeks to "become one with the horse, a Centaur," the half-man, half-horse of ancient mythology.
For Mr. Flitner, the Wyoming cowboy, the goal is simply to breed contented, well-mannered horses. He keeps some on the ranch to work cattle and sells others for riding or cutting horses, which sort herds of cattle.
"I can criticize the old way because we used to do it," he said. "We would tie its front legs to a post, then throw some blankets at it to get it spooked, then wait for it to stop quivering before we got on."
He added, "But it's no fun to ride a horse that doesn't like you, a horse that would just as soon put your head in a badger hole or run you through a fence."
He stroked the sorrel and made a kissing sound. Before long, the colt had started to relax. He walked away and returned with a pail of oats. "This is a reward for today's good work," he said. "I don't work for nothing. And I don't expect a horse to, either."
 
Big Changes on Ranches
 Mr. Flitner, who graduated from the University of Wyoming with a degree in economics, said that horses come in as many shades of personality as people do. Both cowboys and horses have changed over the years, he said. A generation ago, "every ranch had a few hands that could ride anything."
"Nowadays," he added, "you could stop at four or five ranches before you found anybody who really knows much about horses." And the tough, "cold-blooded" broncs of a century ago, who could be ridden hard for 10 or 15 hours a day, no longer exist, since automobile travel has done away with the need. He said horses, like people, were shaped by their environments.
"I don't think a horse is born to be mean, just like a criminal ain't born to be bad," he said. "A criminal, he's probably been beaten down by poverty and frustrated with the way the world's treated him. And a mean horse is the same way."
But many handlers sometimes make the mistake of viewing horses as inanimate tools, he said, with each expected to meet the same standards. Not every horse is capable of top performance, he said, so he does not push them too hard.
"They're just like people," the cowboy said. "In every herd of 15, you've got maybe two with some real talent, and the rest are just wishful thinkers."

HEADLINE: Cozy Links to a U.S Agency Prove Useful to a Rice Trader

SERIES: Tainted Trade: Second of three articles

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES with DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
On Nov. 7, 1988, a cable stamped confidential landed on the desks of officials of the Iraqi Grain Board, one of the largest buyers of imported rice. It was from Peter Vegas, an executive of Comet Rice, a unit of the chronically unprofitable Erly Industries in Los Angeles.
Although the grain board had requested bids, this was not a bid, but an audacious promise -- "We are offering to beat the lowest offer that you receive." 
 The cable explained that Comet Rice had a new plant in the port of Aqaba, Jordan, where rice could be unloaded in bulk, polished, bagged and loaded on trucks bound for Iraq -- for at least $30 a ton less than other bidders. By August 1990, when the Persian Gulf war halted trade with Iraq, the new plant had achieved its purpose: Erly Industries had a near-monopoly in one of the most coveted rice markets.
 
Low-Cost U.S.-Backed Loan
 What the cable did not explain was that the Aqaba plant had been built with a low-cost $4 million federally backed loan from the United States Agency for International Development, which has also given Erly more than $134 million in consulting work.
In a broad examination of the cozy relationship between Corporate Agriculture and the Federal Government, the case of Erly Industries discloses how easily a politically connected agricultural corporation can reap rewards by skillfully exploiting loosely managed Federal programs.
Erly's dealings with A.I.D., the chief conduit for American assistance to needy nations, enabled the corporation to build a plant that lifted its Iraqi rice sales by almost $100 million, more than a fourfold increase.
 
Accused of No Crime
 Comet has not been accused of a crime, but officials of the aid agency now say they believe the company may have acted unethically by not fully explaining just how much it would benefit from the Government-financed plant.
Dozens of interviews, court and corporate documents and hundreds of Federal documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act provide the following details about how Erly used an obscure Government program to corner a valuable market:
*The company did not disclose to A.I.D. the true aim of the Aqaba project, which was to use a little-known Government loan program to give Comet Rice an advantage over other American rice companies.
*It did not disclose its leadership role in the project, letting the agency conclude that a Jordanian company was in charge and that all United States rice exporters would benefit.
*It helped its Jordanian partner sidestep the agency's competitive bidding rules in the buying of plant equipment, thereby insuring that its Comet subsidiary would receive a portion of the loan funds as payment for the equipment.
*It reaped additional profits by investing the low-cost loan proceeds in the United States at higher interest rates.
*It used international government connections, developed at taxpayer expense through a subsidiary's consulting work for A.I.D., to foster its own commercial interests.
Richard L. McCall, who took over this year as chief of staff at the agency, said he had referred the Aqaba loan to the general counsel for review. "It is an ethical question," Mr. McCall said. "For us to be used in any shape, form or fashion for anything but to help develop needy nations is wrong." But he conceded that "we have got to more effectively manage this place" so that all project applications are examined more carefully.
Gerald D. Murphy, Erly's affable and strong-willed chief executive and the company's largest shareholder, sees the Aqaba story as an example of "solving my customer's problems" through a grasp of "how the political game is played."
"I don't have any problems with that," said Mr. Murphy, a conservative Republican who claims friendship with former President Ronald Reagan and other Republican stalwarts. "Those are the rules. I've never understood people who sit back and play a game and don't understand the rules. How the hell are you going to win if you do that?"
 
Getting the Loan
Selling the Deal To the Agency
 Mr. Murphy, a 65-year-old Harvard Business School graduate who has personally directed his company's investment and business strategy over two decades, says the Aqaba plant was his idea. He planned it, Comet Rice built it and a Comet subsidiary managed it -- all for Comet's exclusive use.
But Louis Reade, the agency official who approved the project in 1988, said he was shocked to learn that Erly developed the project for the exclusive use of Comet. "There was no intent to set this up for an individual American corporation," Mr. Reade said.
Instead, he said, A.I.D. believed the loan applicant was a Jordanian company that would create jobs and serve all American rice exporters.
But, according to Mr. Murphy, Jordanians were involved in the Aqaba project only because Jordanian law required it -- and because his partner, Wafai Dajani, brother of a former Jordanian Cabinet minister, had "useful" connections.
 
Other Exporters Barred
 In return for serving as Comet's agent in Jordan, Mr. Dajani and his relatives got consulting fees and a share of the profits. He also invested in the project.
Comet barred other American rice exporters from the Aqaba plant. "I saw no reason to be the front-end guy taking the risk and pass it off to somebody who hadn't taken the risk," he said.
The risk seemed worthwhile: in 1983, when the United States resumed relations with Iraq after a 16-year freeze, Baghdad, with the help of Agriculture Department loan guarantees, became one of the world's biggest buyers of long-grain rice. The department backs commercial loans for countries too strapped to get bank credit on their own.
Seeking more Iraqi business, Mr. Murphy flew to Baghdad in 1987 and, he said, met with Zuhair Daoud, head of the Iraqi Grain Board. Mr. Murphy asked the Iraqi official to list his biggest rice problems. The answer: shipments from Turkey were vulnerable to bandits, shipments into Aqaba were slow and all shipments came in big unwieldy bags.
Mr. Murphy had the perfect solution: an automated rice processing plant in Aqaba. "But we needed some financing," Mr. Murphy said, "and we said, 'Hey, this sounds like an A.I.D. project.' "
 
Agency's Consultant
Knowing Ropes, Hiding Ties
 It is understandable that A.I.D. came to mind. Chemonics International, one of the few profitable subsidiaries of Erly Industries, relies on agency contracts for more than 98 percent of its revenues. On the Aqaba project, Mr. Murphy said, Chemonics knew the right person to see.
When Mr. Murphy's brainchild was submitted to the agency the actual application was made by Amman Resources, Mr. Dajani's company.
The application reflected a thorough knowledge of the agency's policy manual -- and it conspicuously avoided disclosing the true relationship between Comet Rice and Amman Resources.
For example, the executive who signed numerous letters from Amman Resources to A.I.D. and the Bank of Jordan is also listed in Erly Industries records and correspondence as an employee of Comet Rice. Nowhere in the agency correspondence is Comet identified as anything but the supplier of equipment for the plant.
 
No Competitive Bids
 The agency's rules normally would have required Amman Resources to get bids from other suppliers of rice-processing equipment. Amman Resources avoided this by telling the aid agency that it had a "sole distributorship" contract with Comet, signed on Oct. 21, 1987.
This contract, the agency was told, prevented Amman Resources from buying the equipment from other companies. Without checking, the agency exempted the project from competitive bidding rules.
On Feb. 2, 1988, a $4 million loan to Amman Resources was approved by the agency, based on the conclusion that it would help Jordan.
 
Profiting on Loan
An Investment Brings Windfall
 With A.I.D.'s green light, Mr. Murphy's partnership negotiated the loan terms with the Bank of Jordan -- and arranged to profit by investing the proceeds in a safer currency and at higher interest rates than the original loan.
In early 1988, the partners made a 10 percent down payment on the $4 million project and borrowed $3.6 million, in Jordanian dinars, for five years at 6.25 percent interest. That is at least seven percentage points less than Erly would have paid for credit in the United States, given the company's shaky finances. Indeed, the agency-backed rate was less than the Federal Government, considered the soundest borrower around, was being charged on five-year Treasury bonds. A seven-point cut in the interest rate on a $3.6 million loan saves the borrower $252,000 a year.
Mr. Murphy is proud of the arbitrage windfall. First, his partnership shifted the loan from dinars into dollars ahead of a 40 percent deterioration in the dinar, which meant it took fewer dollars to repay the borrowed dinars. "We had good information," Mr. Murphy said with a smile, when asked if Mr. Dajani's connections had guided the currency switch.
 
Deposited in New York
 Then, the borrowed dollars were left on deposit at a New York bank "because it earned more interest than it was costing me on the A.I.D. loan on the other side," Mr. Murphy explained. He did not say how much more, but many five-year corporate bonds were paying at least 8.25 percent interest in 1988.
What is less clear is how the partnership paid for the rice-processing plant. Comet's independent audits show the Aqaba partnership had also taken out an interest-free loan from Comet during this period, but Mr. Murphy said he could not recall if that covered the cost of equipment shipped to Jordan or equipment for a subsequent expansion.
Nor is it clear whether A.I.D. regulations address such arbitrage activity. "But," said Mr. McCall, the chief of staff, "I feel the taxpayers' dollars should not be used to manipulate a set of circumstances and reap a profit at the public's expense."
 
Connections
Finding Business: A Political Process
 The A.I.D. loan is but one example Mr. Murphy cites of how his company has benefited from official connections that Erly's Chemonics subsidiary has developed through its aid agency work.
Mr. Murphy said he started Chemonics in 1976 because "I've always wanted a way to do two things: one, have my own C.I.A., and two, be helpful to people."
His recipe for cooking up business, he said, was to send the new unit's president to Washington to call on members of Congress, announcing he was a consultant looking for business.
Chemonics, whose staff includes former A.I.D. and Agriculture Department officials, has more than quadrupled its revenues in the last decade. It has been hired by the aid agency to work on issues close to Erly's heart, ranging from trade policy in Jamaica, where Comet was trying to increase its rice imports, to alternative crops in Honduras, where Erly was considering a citrus project.
 
'An Open Door'
 Thanks to Chemonics contacts with top-level ministers of foreign governments, Mr. Murphy said, Erly executives "have an open door to walk in and sit down and talk about whatever seems sensible." And Chemonics "has given me an appreciation for the political process in Washington in a different way," he added.
"It's obviously a political process," he continued. "A.I.D. contracts just don't happen."
Thurston Teele, the president of Chemonics, said he helped on the Aqaba A.I.D. project. But he disputed Mr. Murphy's account of the unit's role in other Erly ventures, saying Chemonics had "scrupulous policies" in place "to avoid conflicts of interest."
Nevertheless, more than a dozen Chemonics proposals to the agency boast of linkages among various Erly subsidiaries. In one, Chemonics noted that Erly "has strong and influential links with U.S. Government agencies, from which our projects can benefit." On another, Mr. Murphy himself was picked to serve on a project advisory council. And in each instance, Chemonics reassuringly depicts its parent corporation as successful and financially robust.
 
Storm Warnings
Company Record A Bumpy Road
 In fact, without the profits Erly earned by dominating the Iraq trade and advising the aid agency, the publicly traded corporation almost certainly would have sunk under the weight of its own financial mismanagement.
What Chemonics left out of the corporate track record was a messy series of unwise loans, mushrooming debt, unsuccessful acquisitions, aborted spinoffs, lax accounting and money-losing foreign ventures.
In 1988, as the Aqaba project was being built, Erly told investors that it faced "a short-term cash liquidity problem." A little more than a year later, Erly missed an interest payment to bondholders and its independent auditors were warning that there was "substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern."
In March 1990, Erly proposed a complicated merger between its Comet Rice unit and another struggling company, American Rice Inc. of Houston, which it controlled -- but it could not find lenders.
Clearly, despite the glowing descriptions by Chemonics, Erly would have had trouble competing in Iraq against strong American rivals like the Continental Grain Company or Cargill Inc., without its edge in Aqaba.
As it was, Erly's sales to Iraq grew from less than $19 million in March 1987 to $114.5 million in March 1990. By then, Comet's share of Iraq's rice trade through the Federal export credit guarantee program exceeded 80 percent. And sales to Iraq by Comet represented a remarkable 30 percent of Erly's overall revenues.
 
War Scars
Gulf Clash a Blow To Erly's Trade
 But by August 1989, the warning flags were flying. That was when Federal agents raided the Atlanta branch office of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the big state-controlled Italian bank, investigating whether the bank had made $4 billion worth of unauthorized loans to Iraq.
Banca Lavoro had helped finance Iraq's purchases of agricultural products, including rice from Comet. With the raid, Iraq's eligibility for the export credit program was threatened. Then, in August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and trade with Baghdad was embargoed.
The impact on Erly was severe. By March 1991, only $21.5 million worth of rice had been sold to Iraq, all of that before the invasion. In March 1992, Erly reported a $12.5 million loss, as the vanishing Iraq business halved Comet's profits. That -- and the Federal investigation of Comet's own dealings with Iraq through Banca Lavoro -- made bankers leery of financing the merger with American Rice, Mr. Murphy said.
Erly finally mustered enough credit to complete the merger last May, but as part of the deal, Comet sold the Aqaba plant and a Cayman Island management unit to Mr. Dajani, its Jordanian partner, a deal that finally allowed other companies to use the plant.
Indeed, since the sales contract gives Comet a royalty on non-Comet rice handled by the plant, Mr. Murphy is encouraging his rivals' business. "Hey," he said. "I'm a generous guy."
 
Tainted Trade"
 YESTERDAY: The Agriculture Department's decade-oldj campaign to increase crop exports and aid farmers has instead enriched a small group of multinational corporations and done little to expand America's share of world agricultural markets.
 TODAY: Comet Rice has a plant in Aqaba, Jordan, financed by a federally backed loan that allowed it to corner the coveted Iraqi rice market.
 TOMORROW: Neither a Presidential order nor requests by its own investigators could get the Agriculture Department to kick out politically powerful agricultural companies from Federal programs after they had been caught rigging bids, fixing prices and defrauding Government programs.

HEADLINE: U.N. Asking the Region To Help on Somalia Plan

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct 10

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretary General said today that African, Arab and Muslim leaders would meet with him next week in Ethiopia to map out a strategy to prevent Somalia from collapsing into complete anarchy after the United States withdraws its forces at the end of next March.
The Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said in an interview that President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the current chairman of the Organization of African Unity, had agreed to attend the meeting on Oct. 20 in Addis Ababa along with President Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and the Secretaries General of the the Organization of African Unity, the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Conference, a grouping of Muslim countries. 
 President Clinton's representative in Somalia, Robert B. Oakley, is also expected to attend the talks.
 
To Make a Plan
 The aim of the meeting, Mr. Boutros Ghali said, is to set a plan in motion that would produce enough stability over the next six months to prevent the United Nations peacekeeping operation from disintegrating when American troops depart.
"Let us hope we can find a solution in the next six months," Mr. Boutros-Ghali said. A second meeting, to promote economic recovery, is planned in the Ethiopian capital on Nov. 2.
The Secretary General, who is to leave Wednesday on a visit to the Somali capital and to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, made clear that he was worried that other countries with troops serving in the United Nations force in Somalia would be tempted to pull out when the Americans leave. France and Italy, which currently have a combined 3,500 troops serving in the 28,000-member force in Somalia, are already committed to withdrawing at the end of this year.
"Unless we act now, the gangs will just be waiting to start fighting again when we have gone," Mr. Boutros-Ghali warned. His aim, he said, is to get a durable process of reconciliation under way before then, and then continue the mission with a smaller, mainly African peacekeeping force.
 
Stepped-Up Efforts
 The call for the high-level meeting just 10 days from now is one in a series of signs that the United Nations is speeding its efforts to promote a settlement in Somalia at the urging of the Clinton Administration.
Pressure for a settlement has grown since American forces suffered heavy casualties a week ago in a raid against forces of Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, the fugitive leader of an armed Somali faction in Mogadishu who has been blamed for much of the violence against United Nations soldiers there.
At least 15 American servicemen were killed and dozens were wounded in the raid on Oct. 3, as well as an undetermined number of Somalis.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali described himself as "philosophical" about the recent wave of American criticism of the United Nations, including contentions that United Nations forces in Somalia are disorganized, that they have not acted adequately to back United States troops and that the organization should be doing more to promote a political settlement.
 
Urged to Respond
 Aides have urged Mr. Boutros-Ghali to reply to the criticism for the sake of the organization's reputation. Some have urged him to emphasize to the American public that the disastrous military operation on Oct. 3 was planned and carried out by the Americans, that the United Nations had no advance knowledge of the operation, and that the role of armed peacekeeper is an inherently dangerous one that carries the risk of injury or death.
The Secretary General said he would serve no goal by exchanging bitter words with members of the Clinton Administration or the Congress. "The United Nations exists to help countries solve their problems. If it helps the Americans solve theirs by blaming me, I'll be a scapegoat," he said.
"I cannot afford a confrontation with so important a member as the United States," he added.
After a week of high tensions, the relations between the United Nations and the United States mission here are said by both sides to be regaining balance.
After a difficult meeting early last week at which Madeleine K. Albright, the American representative to the United Nations, told the Secretary General that President Clinton was sending Mr. Oakley to Somalia and that he would not report to the United Nations, Mr. Boutros-Ghali and Ms. Albright said they held successful talks on the Somali crisis Friday night.
"We have excellent cooperation now, and I wish you'd put that on the record," Ms. Albright said afterward.
 
Admitted Shortcomings
 For its part, the United Nations has acknowledged that its multinational force in Somalia has its shortcomings, largely because units from 24 countries still have difficulty working together and sometimes refer their orders back to their national capitals for approval before carrying them out.
By convening the presidents of Egypt and Ethiopia and heads of the regional organizations next week in Addis Ababa, Mr. Boutros-Ghali is relying on a policy for settling conflicts that he outlined for the first time in "Agenda for Peace," a document that he published shortly after assuming the job in January 1992.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Egypt, points out in the paper that the United Nations Charter requires regional organizations to try to resolve local disputes before asking the Security Council to intervene.
 
Bigger Regional Role
 The cold war struggle largely prevented regional organizations from acting effectively as peacemakers. Now that the era has passed, the Secretary General argues that regional groups can and should do more to resolve crises in their areas before asking for help.
"Regional action as a matter of decentralization, delegation and cooperation with United Nations efforts could not only lighten the burden on the Council but also contribute to a deeper sense of participation, consensus and democratization in international affairs," he wrote. The Security Council oversees United Nations peacekeeping.
One difficulty in taking a regional approach to the Somali crisis is that none of the country's neighbors are strong enough to play a dominant role in trying to impose peace.
On the other hand, Mr. Boutros-Ghali shares the wide view that the United Nations is becoming seriously overtaxed as it tries to manage a peacekeeping force of almost 80,000 soldiers in 16 separate operations. The only solution, he concludes, is for regional organizations to pick up more of the burden of preserving order.

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
President Strives Mightily to Shift From Troubles Abroad to Goals at Home

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
There was an October game plan at the White House, and it did not involve Somalia.
President Clinton wanted to focus on health care, push a little harder for the North American Free Trade Agreement and step up his campaign for crime and gun control legislation. 
 It was a pretty plan. But last week it was nearly obliterated by events abroad, with turmoil in Russia and Somalia taking the spotlight from issues closer to home.
Nonetheless, domestic and economic issues are growing more and more pressing. Congress faces a vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement by the end of the year. The White House had promised to produce a legislative framework for its health care proposals within the next few weeks, a possibility that shrinks with each passing day. And the economy is still teetering on the edge of recovery, making job creation a priority.
Stanley Greenberg, the White House pollster, subscribes to the belief that the President must deal with foreign policy because it is unavoidable rather than because it will do anything to help his popularity.
"There's not a lot of evidence that this President or the previous President benefits from foreign policy events, even if they're glorious or splendid," Mr. Greenberg said in an interview. "President Bush saw his job performance ratings slide without hesitation, right through all those foreign policy successes."
 
Hard-to-Swallow Fact of Life
 Mr. Clinton, who has seen his own favorable poll ratings increase with every domestic policy triumph, must now face an unpalatable fact of life. Messy foreign policy crises are more than mere distractions for a President who would prefer to concentrate on domestic concerns. They have become a constant feature of the post-cold-war world that he is now helping to govern.
When the President would rather have been forging ahead on other issues, he found himself instead devoting significant time to tracking the instability in Russia and plotting a course that he hoped would lead the United States out of Somalia.
The grand domestic plan fell apart last Sunday, just before he left for a trip to California where he planned to talk about health care. Returning from church, Mr. Clinton met with his national security advisers about the raid on a Somali general in which at least 15 American soldiers were killed and the fighting in Moscow between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Parliament.
The advisers stayed behind to plot strategy, and the President left town with the intent of talking about domestic matters. But it did not work out that way.
At a televised forum that night, the first question from the hosts was about Russia. Before he began his speech to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. the next day, he issued a statement about Somalia and Russia, expanding on the same remarks less than an hour later at the end of a speech about Federal efforts to help Califonrnia.
On Tuesday, he cut short an appearance before California retirees to hurry back to Washington for more meetings.
By week's end, the President had delivered a concise television address on Somalia that his aides hoped would prove he had grappled with the subject while erasing the specters of Vietnam and Middle East hostage-taking that had begun to cloud what had originally been sold as a solely humanitarian enterprise. That effort may have been futile. A poll commissioned by Time magazine and CNN found that a majority did not approve of the continued American presence in Somalia.
 
A Touch of Wistfulness
 Mr. Clinton has straddled such conflicts before by arguing that foreign and domestic policy are interrelated, and he sounded that note almost wistfully last week in a speech before the Democratic National Committee. "It's an absolutely fascinating time to be President and a great honor actually to be President in this difficult time, to try to construct the framework for the post-cold-war world," he said. "I spend an enormous amount of time on that, but I usually talk about what we're doing in this country, because I believe you cannot be strong abroad unless you are strong at home."
The President returned to domestic matters in his weekly radio address on Saturday. Mr. Clinton focused on crime, sidestepping the events in Somalia that had dominated his private and public agenda all week long.
In the Republican broadcast response, Representative David A. Levy of Long Island chastised the President.
"While the crime issue he discussed is very important, it is not the issue of today," Mr. Levy said. "Americans are talking about other subjects this weekend."
But in striving to shift the public discussion back to more politically advantageous subjects, Mr. Clinton is adhering to his own instincts as well as to the theories of his closest political advisers.
Indulging himself in at least a measure of wishful thinking, Mr. Greenberg said Mr. Clinton would be able to keep domestic policy in focus because that was what most Americans were demanding.
"I don't think we're into a period of foreign policy," he said. "A lot will depend on what happens in Somalia. If it looks like it's under control, people will quickly shift their attention to domestic concerns."

HEADLINE: In Campaign for the Health Care Plan, Hillary Clinton Is the Top Candidate

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Catchy slogans, far-fetched television commercials, fund-raising appeals in the mail. The election-style battle over health care legislation already has many trappings of the modern campaign.
Much of it, from the slogan "Health Care That's Always There" to the pretentiously titled "War Room" at the White House where the battle is being directed, was predictable enough. But what sets this one apart from most propaganda efforts for legislation from the civil rights bills of the 60's to the tax cuts of the 80's is that this campaign looks as if it has a candidate -- Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 All this year she has been in charge of developing the Administration's plan, although even a few weeks ago it was not clear how big a role she would take in selling it. Her appearances before dazzled Congressional committees answered that question. But that was only the most visible of her efforts.
Students, and their elders, stayed as long as she would Friday night waiting to shake her hand or offer praise after she used a Brown University stage for a television program on health care.
Earlier, a crowd waited in suburban Warwick, R.I., to catch a glimpse of her limousine as she left a nursing home. The occasion was a textbook campaign photo opportunity with the First Lady, elderly residents and cute kids playing with paste. Nobody pointed out that the event was held to sell a health care plan that does not, after all, propose to pay for nursing home care.
 
Trusting Expectation
 Coming a week after her five hit appearances on Capitol Hill, perhaps these displays of popular attention might be put down to mere celebrity.
But in fact, Mrs. Clinton's connection to the public seems much stronger than that.
For much of the summer, when Mrs. Clinton was out of the public eye, nurses and doctors in Philadelphia repeatedly told a Washingtonian who was visiting her mother in hospitals there to "Tell Hillary" this or "Tell Hillary" that about the health care system. That is the sort of trusting expectation only a rare candidate gets from the public, something that is often lost after the election as unpleasant new issues arise. Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society was overcome by Vietnam. George Bush's New World Order lost out to the recession.
Another advantage she has over traditional candidates is that their ties to the voters can be broken by attacks from the opposition. But the foes of the Administration's health care plan seem to have decided that they cannot safely attack a First Lady, and some even want to share the attention that follows her.
 
Improbable Drama
 So the critics attack the plan in detail and in general, with careful argument and with florid oratory, like the recent suggestion by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia that the plan "means if you are 55 and you need kidney dialysis, you die."
The Health Insurance Association of America has a television commercial that reduces one of the most complicated issues the country has even confronted into 30 seconds of improbable drama, a glimpse of a couple at their kitchen table reminiscing about the wonderful health insurance policy they used to have.
But against Mrs. Clinton's earnestness, sometimes all of this sounds about as compelling as Jimmy Carter explaining why Ronald Reagan's economic proposals did not add up.
The First Lady can alternate, as she did Friday at Brown, between an appeal for the nation to unite to "rebuild not only our health care system but our sense of caring and community that will ultimately make this country what it ought to be for all of us" and generalized attacks on the "people who make their money out of the current status quo."
These unnamed villains, she said at Brown, profit when the current system harms the sort of ordinary people who appeared on television with her. There was the Coles family of Groton, Conn., whose baby's heart treatment had hit the $1 million limit on their health insurance. And there were the Hanrahans of Cranston, R.I., who could not get insurance or day care for the husband, who is afflicted by Alzheimer's disease.
 
Congress Likes Her, Too
 Of course, Mrs. Clinton is leading a very special sort of campaign in which Congress will cast the votes on a yet-to-be-scheduled Election Day. Appeals to the public are important, but so are appeals to the lawmakers themselves. And no Washington figure who is not appearing at fund-raising events is in so much demand for visits in the home districts as she is.
The appeals don't come just from loyal backers. It is a measure of her dominance of the issue that many who disagree with the Administration's prescription for change want to appear with the First Lady.
Four Republican Senators, for instance, are trying to persuade her to join them for a hearing later this month. Led by Bob Dole, the minority leader, and his fellow Kansan, Nancy Landon Kassebaum, these Senators oppose the plan's basic scheme of requiring employers to pay health insurance premiums for workers.
 
Opponents Join In
 On Friday two Rhode Island Republicans who do not support the Clinton plan came along when the First Lady toured the Providence area. Representative Ronald K. Machtley, who favors a plan with neither universal coverage nor cost controls, turned up both at the nursing home and later for the television show.
Senator John H. Chafee, who backs a plan that would require individuals to get insurance but not make employers help pay for it, introduced her in glowing terms. He called her "a battler for a cause," adding: "Her cause is reform of health care in the United States of America."
Later she used the Republicans almost as props on the television program, carried on several New England stations as if it was news. She sympathized with the Coleses, the Hanrahans and others, telling them their problems would be used if the Administration plan was enacted.
Neither Mrs. Clinton, the two Republicans nor two Democrats who joined them, Senator Claiborne Pell and Representative John F. Reed, discussed whether the Administration bill was the best way to solve those problems or whether some other plan like the ones the Republicans sponsored might do better.
At the end of the program they got their reward -- equal billing with the Coles and Hanrahan families. Mrs. Clinton announced that the program had proved two things: "One, that there are real people with real problems that can be solved with a careful and thoughtful approach to health care reform, and that we do have political leadership in the Congress that is making the hard decisions."

HEADLINE: Labor Wants Shorter Hours To Make Up for Job Losses

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Union leaders and some economists are beginning to talk seriously about what once seemed a far-fetched remedy for disappearing high-pay jobs: a shorter workweek.
This may not sound like a particularly novel idea; millions of part-timers already work far fewer than 40 hours a week. But the unions would insist that regular full-time workers whose weeks are cut to 35 hours or so keep their 40-hour pay and benefits. 
 "There's no question that the long-term salvation of work lies in reducing working hours," said Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the 95-union American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, which met here this week.
Promoting a shorter workweek may smack of economic snake oil. At a time when several thousand workers are still being laid off every week, asking businesses to take on the added costs of new employees might seem just another of labor's occasional pie-in-the-sky causes.
Certainly no one in Congress is offering legislation that would require a shorter week, and few unions are demanding it at the bargaining table.
 
Unemployment Antidote
 But unions, despite the long decline of their membership and influence, still introduce many innovations in the workplace, particularly in manufacturing, where they are strongest. And a shorter week looms as a novel way to deal with the continuing loss of high-paying, often highly skilled jobs.
In a letter to the House and Senate Labor Committees released last week, William Proxmire, who was considered a leading advocate of labor's causes during his 32 years in the Senate, argued that a shorter workweek would cut unemployment.
It is not uncommon today in some industries for employees to work less than 40 hours. But few workplaces have crossed the 35-hour threshold. Postal carriers, telephone operators and press operators at some newspapers routinely work 35-hour weeks, and some construction workers have 32-hour weeks.
Some labor scholars are promoting shorter weeks, too, both to spread the available work and to relieve the stress of certain jobs.
 
'The Tooth Fairy'
 The most visible scholar of employment practices, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, flatly spurned shorter weeks in an interview in February. But before addressing the convention on Tuesday he said, "I need to think about it more."
Predictably, business advocates show little enthusiasm for the shorter week if it means higher labor costs. Martin Lefkowitz, a labor relations expert at the National Chamber Foundation in Washington, equated the notion with "the tooth fairy."
But David Lewin, director of the Institute of Industrial Relations at the business school of the University of California at Los Angeles, called it "a legitimate proposition," adding, "I think the difficulty is not in the conception but in the implementation."
Currently, he said, many employers prefer to pay overtime wages of time and a half, because it is cheaper than taking on full-time permanent workers. Unions are fighting that trend by pressuring employers to pay double wages for overtime.
Another incentive for overtime -- it incurs no additional health insurance costs -- could change if President Clinton's health care plan is implemented.
 
The Productivity Factor
 Advocates also argue that many employers can accommodate shorter workweeks at current pay levels because technology and automation have helped raise workers' productivity, especially in industries like steel and telecommunications.
Last week's A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention was the first in decades at which a shorter workweek was on everybody's mind.
"It's becoming a higher and higher item on the agenda as we watch this alleged economic recovery unfold without creating enough jobs," said Lynn Williams, president of the United Steelworkers of America.
One reason for the unions' interest is their view that the Clinton Administration's answer to the decline in well-paid factory positions -- retraining programs -- usually leads to worse jobs or to no jobs at all.
"They talk about retraining, but retraining for what?" said Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the letter carriers union. "As the population grows and we're squeezed out of manufacturing, we have to think about how to stretch jobs to more people."
 
Advocates From Academia
 Outside the labor movement, some economists and other scholars are urging shorter hours either to spread work or to relieve the strain of 40-hour and longer weeks on two-worker families.
Juliet B. Schor, an economist at Harvard, said the average American worked 1,924 hours in 1989 compared with 1,786 hours two decades earlier, an increase of 7.7 percent. After examining the effects of reductions in workers' hours, she concluded that "shrinking the 40-hour workweek by up to five hours leads to less absenteeism, less turnover, less personal business on company time and lower costs."
Dr. Schor added that given the dim outlook for economic growth, "reducing work time may now be the only feasible way to generate significant numbers of jobs."
Benjamin K. Hunnicutt, a professor of history at the University of Iowa and an editor of a newsletter for a group called the Society for the Reduction of Human Labor, said demand for shorter workweeks was strong in Europe, where high unemployment had proved intractable.
Whether the same happens in the United States, he said, depends on whether unemployment continues to rise. "I think the critical point is 10 or 12 percent," he said. In August the rate was 6.7 percent in the United States and about 10 percent in Europe. But here in California, the most populous state, the rate was 9 percent. The figures for September, announced on Friday, showed the national rate flat at 6.7 percent but California's rate up, at 9.4 percent.
 
Dangerous Overtime Gambit
 In addition to shorter workweeks, he said, workers can be offered extra time off in lieu of raises, vacations can be stretched to five or six weeks, the norm in Europe, and longer leaves can be granted for sickness and child bearing.
For years, unions have resisted temptations to resurrect demands for fewer hours because many of their members covet their right to time and a half for overtime, and many have come to depend on it.
What is more, the assumption that double pay for overtime would lead to more hiring has not faced a real test. Ronald G. Ehrenberg, a professor at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell, doubts that it would. Instead of hiring more workers, he said, companies that balked at paying double wages might well opt for increased automation, which would result in fewer jobs.
Some union leaders warn that unions must not become so absorbed in shorter workweeks that they abandon the greater goal of strong economic growth and good jobs for all. Shorter workweeks, said Vernon Watkins, an official of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, "just spread the level of misery."
And Donald Bushey, an official of the Washington State labor council, said that pushing for shorter weeks "just says these jobs are forever gone. The answer is to do something about the reasons the jobs are gone."

Underground Economy Popping Up at Curbside

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 10

 BODY:
There's money to be made in the clamor of the streets, and Mario Garcia is intent on making it.
Starting at around 10 in the morning, and lasting until 3 in the afternoon when he heads for the technical school where he said he is studying to be an electrician, Mr. Garcia, all optimism and energy at 21, scurries around the traffic of one of Mexico City's busiest intersections trying to interest motorists in buying red-and-yellow plastic baby gyms. 
 "Here, look," he told a middle-aged man driving a white Volkswagen. "It's very nice. Makes music. Cheaper than in the stores."
Stuck in traffic, the driver had no choice but to listen to Mr. Garcia's rapid-fire pitch. A slight hesitation in the way he said no, an almost imperceptible uncertainty, was enough to encourage Mr. Garcia to chase after him even after traffic started moving, although there was no sale.
 
An Appeal to Impulse
 Along every major street and at nearly every busy intersection, Mexico City's legion of street vendors -- like those in some parts of New York -- stand ready to turn traffic congestion into impulse buying.
Officially tolerated though technically illegal, the Mexican street bazaar testifies to some of the problems that dog Mexico's economy.
Never mind privatization, single-digit inflation or the other reforms that make up Mexico's economic miracle. About one-third of all workers are in the underground economy. For the thousands of Mexican quick-deal peddlers, the streets are the economy, providing a level of income that generally -- depending on the weather and the traffic -- exceeds Mexico City's minimum wage for general labor of about $4.60 a day.
Attention has been focused on how much Mexicans earn since debate began in earnest on the North American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement would lower, and eventually eliminate, tariffs on most goods shipped among Mexico, Canada and the United States. Critics say there is no way American workers can compete with low Mexican wages.
 
Better Luck With Garlic
 But cheap wages give Mexicans a headache too and send some of them into the streets hawking miniature owls or garlands of garlic, or five-foot-high wooden coat racks.
"Even counting what we have to pay the officials to let us stay here we can earn a little more in the street than the minimum wage," said Lorenzo Gonzalez, a stocky 35-year-old father of four whose street shop consists of a bumpy stretch of University Avenue in Mexico City.
On a recent Wednesday morning, Mr. Gonzalez's assortment of goods included two wooden abacuses (priced at about $3.30 each, or whatever he can bargain from a driver in the minute or so it takes for a light to change) two plastic clothes hangers ($3.30 each) and, for $5, an 18-inch-high Olive Oyl doll.
Maria Juana Morales said that she would not be able to survive on what she makes by going out on University Avenue every day, selling packages of Clorets gum for one peso -- 33 cents -- each.
 
Learning on the Streets
 That is why, she said matter-of-factly, she needs to have her 12-year-old son, Alfredo, and her 6-year-old son, Alberto, selling with her. "Anyway," she said of Alfredo, "he didn't want to go to school anymore."
Alberto has the composure of a budding businessman. He tells a stranger that he can sell two boxes of Clorets packages a day, 20 packages to the box, and that gives him about 20 pesos in profit.
Over on Chapultepec Avenue, a young man darted into a line of cars with an inflated 2-foot-high champagne bottle. Back on Reforma, underneath the gilded statue of the Angel of Independence, one of Mexico's most revered symbols, a line of hawkers snaked through the midday traffic: a lottery ticket salesman, someone selling toys that look like collapsible plastic cones, someone selling posters illustrating in graphic detail "The 365 Ways of Love," a man with umbrellas, then Mr. Garcia with his baby gym.
By and large, Mexico City tolerates this explosion of entrepreneurial spirit. But a few weeks ago city officials cracked down on peddlers who set up small stands on downtown sidewalks. The Mayor of Mexico City, Manuel Camacho Solis, proudly said the city was reclaiming its center.
But the 10,000 vendors who were dislocated either moved into city markets or onto sidewalks outside the restricted zone, leaving officials open to criticism from some here that they had only transferred the problem.
 
Only a Promise
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has promised the minimum wages will rise. But someone like Mr. Gonzalez, who might take six hours to sell one pink plastic hanger, does not hold out much hope.
"It's just a promise, nothing else," Mr. Gonzalez said. "They do it all the time, and the promises never turn into reality."
Mr. Gonzalez may have been jaded by his own experience and his own lack of salesmanship.
But even for someone as young as Mr. Garcia, the 21-year-old technical school student with a smile that could sell even a baby gym, the informal economy can appear more promising than established business. He said he used to work at the McDonald's restaurant in downtown Mexico City. He was a maintenance man for 130 pesos a week, about $43.
Selling baby gyms for 100 pesos -- $33 -- which is a markup of 50 percent from what he pays for them, can earn him around 200 pesos a week.
"You've got to be able to have pride in what you do," Mr. Garcia said, readying another baby gym for flash presentation on Reforma. "People think we're out here because we're lazy, but you have to have vision to be here. To succeed, you've got to be able to see where people are coming from, and where they're going."

Mayoral Campaign Tests The Loyalty of Democrats

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"I GUARANTEE you," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said last week, urging that New York City's mayoral candidates define the issues that separate them, "that they'll be out of time before you get to 'R' in the alphabet for race, religion or even rhetoric."
Neither Mayor David N. Dinkins nor Mr. Cuomo, though, has been reluctant to invoke the symbolism of another R-word: Republican. 
 In a city where enrolled Democrats outnumber Republicans by better than 4-to-1, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal nominee, cannot win unless about 1 in 3 Democrats defect. The mayoral race represents a vital test of whether the party's over.
Can unoiled political organizations get out the votes? Will party loyalty be subsumed by rhetoric about race and religion -- and by Mr. Dinkins's performance compared to Mr. Giuliani's promise -- and mirror the national political realignment?
Look for one signal as soon as this week: Will former Mayor Edward I. Koch embrace Mr. Giuliani, whose disparaging remarks about the Koch administration four years ago seemed to have been all but forgotten, or abstain from publicly endorsing either candidate?
The other enrolled Republican running for mayor, George Marlin, the Conservative Party nominee, was raised in a Democratic family. Mr. Giuliani is a lapsed Democrat. He would be the first Roman Catholic of two Italian parents (Fiorello H. La Guardia was half Jewish and, like Mr. Dinkins, was raised as an Episcopalian) to be elected mayor without (like Vincent R. Impelliteri) having served as acting mayor first.
Ethnic background is no guarantee of party loyalty: Growing numbers of Italian-Americans (and of Hispanic people, too) vote Republican.
"Reagan Democrats are coming back," William Powers, the Republican State Chairman, said the other day. "An awful lot of it has been driven by the economy and culture, but race could be an underlying factor."
Professor John H. Mollenkopf of the City University Graduate Center figures that as many as 1 in 4 enrolled Democrats typically vote for Republican candidates for President.
The most recent New York Times/ WCBS-TV News poll found that 26 percent of those surveyed who described themselves as Democrats said they would vote for Mr. Giuliani, compared to 15 percent of Republicans, many of them blacks, who said they would defect to Mr. Dinkins.
The portent of ticket-splitting bodes badly for Mr. Dinkins's and for Mr. Giuliani's running mates. Among Democrats, 60 percent said they would vote for Mr. Dinkins, 75 percent for his running mate for Public Advocate, Mark Green, and 63 percent for the Democratic nominee for Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi.
While only 14 percent of Republicans consider themselves liberal, 23 percent of Democrats characterize themselves as conservative.
La Guardia ran in 1933 as a New Dealer with the tacit blessing of a Democratic White House. In 1965, John V. Lindsay was nominated by a largely progressive Republican Party that denied him renomination in 1969 (he won re-election anyway, against a conservative Democrat and a conservative Republican) and a decade later rejected another liberal icon, Senator Jacob K. Javits.
La Guardia argued that there was no Democratic or Republican way to collect garbage, a premise that Republicans pressing to privatize more city services would dispute, or to distribute welfare, which Democrats who demonize the Reagan and Bush Administrations would deny.
Neither party is very good at collecting votes or distributing patronage. The Democrats are strongest in Queens. Despite local inroads scored by State Senator Roy M. Goodman's organization in Manhattan, the Republican Party has been even more disorganized -- hobbled by so much factionalism that Harold M. Fisher, a Democratic Party patriarch, was recently recruited to referee a convention of feuding Brooklyn Republicans.
"Party loyalty by itself is not going to swing anybody," David Garth, Mr. Giuliani's media strategist, says of the Dinkins campaign's persistence in labeling Mr. Giuliani a Republican. "That's the reason they're also doing the 'racist,' 'fascist' business."
Still, the potential for party loyalty is one reason Mr. Giuliani is doing the "fusion business." On the ballot, the Republican logo may be merged with the listing for the contrived Independent Fusion Party, a hollow echo of the City Fusion Party that embraced La Guardia. Rather, it resembles the independent party created for Mr. Lindsay, who also organized his own political machine loyal only to him.
"The politicians who make a lastin' success in politics are the men who are always loyal to their friends -- even up to the gates of state prison if necessary," Tammany's George Washington Plunkitt wrote. He added, though, that loyalty to a politician had its limits: "If he only looks after his own interests or shows no talent for scenting out jobs or ain't got the nerve to demand and get his share of the good things that are goin', his followers may be absolved from their allegiance and they may up and swat him without bein' put down as political ingrates."
Today, the party is less a viable organization than a symbolic label that vaguely reflects organized opinion. Mr. Giuliani can win only if enough Democrats conclude they will get a greater share of the good things from him than they have gratitude for Mr. Dinkins.

HEADLINE: Discounting Finally Makes It to Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Japan's new leaders were swept to power amid promises that the Government would no longer tolerate ridiculously high prices and that companies would have to stop enriching themselves at home while offering deep discounts on cameras and television sets in Manhattan and Hong Kong.
Still, no one in the Japanese bureaucracy was quite prepared to deal with retailers like Ken Fujisawa, who had the temerity, in a family-owned store on a back street of Tokyo, to do what no one else had in a generation -- offer Japanese women a 20 percent discount on cosmetics made by the giant of the Japanese industry, Shiseido. 
 For years, Japan's Fair Trade Commission had turned a blind eye to complaints that women in this country pay at least double for cosmetics than they do when traveling abroad. But then a few days ago, to his own shock, the ebullient 45-year-old Mr. Fujisawa won an enormous victory for Japanese consumers. A court ordered Shiseido to resume supplying stores like Mr. Fujisawa's, even if they sell by mail order and ignore the cosmetics maker's quiet pressure never to undercut the suggested retail price.
Days before the ruling, the Fair Trade Commission, suddenly baring its teeth after years of biting its tongue, raided Shiseido's offices and seized documents after another retailer had complained that he, too, had been cut off for offering deep discounts.
"Shiseido's case is typical of Japan's closed retailing system, which has been victimizing Japanese for too long," Mr. Fujisawa said the other day, scampering around the crowded back room where his workers fill orders faxed in from housewives and "office ladies" around the Tokyo region. "But now there is a change in political power and in the social trends. It's finally happening."
Discounting is suddenly, and finally, bursting onto Tokyo's streets.
One of the hottest stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange these days is Aoyama Trading, a supplier of discount men's suits whose customers do not seem to mind if some of the tailoring is done in North Korea.
When the company's first big competitor opened its doors in the pricey Ginza area earlier this month, just two blocks behind the giant full-price Mitsukoshi Department Store, 3,000 people lined up for the opening morning sale. A number of them had spent the night on the sidewalk -- near entrances to the "hostess bars," where, during the late 80's boom, executives thought nothing of dropping $500 a person on an evening's entertainment.
Inside the new men's wear discount shop, Haruyama, there are none of the elaborate floral arrangements, none of the perfectly manicured saleswomen and none of the art galleries that help drive up the prices in Tokyo's chic department stores. Instead, there are racks of clothes pushed together so tightly that customers have to walk down the aisles sideways.
The company maintains that it will offer Mitsukoshi-quality suits at 30 percent to 40 percent off. Publicly, the department stores shrug off the new entries, saying they serve a different breed of customer, but few doubt that the discounters help explain why department store sales have been flat for so long.
For certain products, particularly electronics, discounting has been around in Japan for some time -- though often the effects are hardly noticeable. The huge number of Japanese tourists who return home from overseas with Nikon lenses, Sony CD players and Panasonic portable phones are walking testimony to the price differentials between Japan and the rest of the world -- a condition that has never seemed to yield to market forces.
Until recently, Japanese manufacturers and Government officials usually had plenty of explanations at hand, explaining that consumers would never tolerate the kind of minimalist service provided in American discount stores or that the products that Japanese makers sell in their home market are different from those they export. But with some exceptions most of those differences are modest, at best.
 
More Than Political Change
 Now, the fall of the Liberal Democratic Party this year, after 38 years in power, has sent a liberating wind through the retail markets. At some discount outlets, service is refreshingly rude -- no one even bows to customers and yells "Irrashaimasu!" (Welcome!).
If the Fair Trade Commission acts up, manufacturers seem to have a harder time getting political fixers to step in. Suddenly, it is politically acceptable to talk about discount airline tickets, as Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa did in his opening speech to Parliament a few weeks ago. The Transport Ministry got the hint: A few days later, by remarkable coincidence, a 20 percent cut in fares to Europe was announced.
The new Government's focus on the pricing issue intensified last week when the Prime Minister ordered a study of price differences between Japan and other countries as part of a 12-point plan to increase imports.
He also acknowledged that Japanese consumers were getting almost none of the benefits of the tremendous strength of the yen, which should, in theory, have made imported goods much less expensive. In fact, the gains are being soaked up along the tortuous distribution chain -- what Mr. Hosokawa called a "severe structural problem in our economy."
 
Consumer Has a Way to Go
 Still, the Government has not exactly pressed companies to the wall. After protests made it obvious that Japanese utilities would be forced to pass on some of their savings from buying oil with the strong yen, the International Trade and Industry Ministry held a series of special meetings with leaders of the industry. The result: a reduction that works out to about 100 yen, or roughly $1, a month for an average household. Japan's utility rates are among the highest in the world: heating a three-bedroom, American-size home can easily cost $700 a month.
"I think that Hosokawa's stance in favor of deregulation has made a big change in the atmosphere," said Yoshihiro Sakamoto, the director general of international trade policy at the ministry, which has done its own share of price setting. Suddenly, he said, with some wonderment apparent on his face, "even the Fair Trade Commission has been trying to stand on the consumer's side," adding, "This is a big experiment for our society."
It is an experiment many companies, already squeezed by the recession, desperately wish would go away.
Everyone argues about what keeps prices so high in Japan, but certainly part of it is the tremendous control most manufacturers have maintained over their distribution channel. Most retailers dare not anger their suppliers by offering discounts on brand-name goods.
 
The Cosmetics Paradigm
 Perhaps there is no better example than in cosmetics. The Government exempted cosmetics from price competition starting in the 1950's, giving manufacturers the right to enforce specific retail prices. Those regulations were taken off the books in 1973. Since then, the market has been free -- at least on paper.
But for the next 20 years, Shiseido products -- the top of the line -- have almost never been found for even a yen below the suggested retail price. The company dispatched thousands of specialists to retail stores to advise women on how to best use Shiseido products.
However, Toshimasa Tsuruta, a professor at Senshu University, has recently written that they served another purpose. "They were the 'price guard,' " he said.
The company says that is nonsense. "Discounting is not the issue," said Shinsaku Sugiyama, a spokesman for Shiseido. "We know very well we cannot dictate the retail price. It is an issue of how our cosmetics are sold."
The reason that Shiseido cut off its business with Mr. Fujisawa's company after 31 years, he said, is that his employees stopped selling their goods in a store, as its contract dictates, and began taking orders by fax and phone. "Everything has to do with the atmosphere in which the product is sold, where it is seen," he said. "This is the fashion industry."
Shiseido's problem is that virtually everyone else, including the Tokyo District Court, views that argument as a smokescreen. Shiseido is fighting back with unusually strong words for a Japanese company, declaring the court's ruling "absolutely not acceptable," and saying it will "engage in an all-out fight" on appeal.
 
So Cheap It Might Be Insolvent
 Shiseido's battles, though, may be spreading. This spring, it cut off another discounter, Kawachiya Ltd., which began selling cosmetics at 25 percent to 35 percent discounts but only in the store. The cosmetics maker has argued that Kawachiya was reselling its products at other retailers. It also argues that Kawachiya's margins are so slim that it could easily fall into the red and be unable to pay Shiseido. But so far, Shiseido cannot cite a single instance in which its payments have been delayed from the retailer.
(Shiseido typically sells its products to retailers in Japan for 59 percent of the retail price, meaning that the discounter's prices to the public ran from 6 to 16 percent above wholesale.)
In the meantime, Mr. Fujisawa has posted a big sign at his store, run by his wife, Reiko, explaining that he has been cut off from a third of his business. He has even submitted protests to the United States trade representative's office, hoping that its negotiators would take up his case. They declined, saying there were no American products involved in the dispute.
"We need gaiatsu," concludes Mr. Fujisawa, using the word for foreign pressure. "The Japanese economy developed by victimizing consumers. That made it competitive, but led to trade surpluses."
Now, he said, "Shiseido cannot read the change of the era."

HEADLINE: First Step In Making An Eyesore An Asset

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
For Brooklyn's Gowanus Canal, June 21, 1911, was a glorious day. A new system to flush out the putrid industrial canal was installed, as 350 dignitaries applauded from a barge and a young woman tossed red carnations on the still waters.
The system, which involved a tunnel to bring clean water from New York Harbor to the head of the canal to get the stagnant waters moving, functioned for about half a century before breaking. Now, a mere 33 years later, the city is finally getting around to fixing it. Money has been appropriated, parts have been ordered, and bids have been invited. 
 "The water problem has been solved," said Salvatore Scotto, president of the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation, a neighborhood coordinator for housing and other services, which has pushed to make the mile-and-a-half waterway a community resource.
 
'Something Bold' Needed
 The repair work, which involves replacing a turbine that pumps the water and is expected to be completed by 1995, would be the first step toward realizing Mr. Scotto's dreams for the canal, which runs from Gowanus Bay into the heart of the Boerum Hill neighborhood.
He envisions that the canal, which in 1973 was found to contain cholera and typhoid germs and which still stinks and sometimes literally bubbles with pollution, can become something like San Antonio's River Walk.
He sees restaurants, art galleries and boutiques where now there are auto graveyards, warehouses and assorted rubble. He sees nice apartment buildings rising. Fish will return. And, under Federal legislation now pending, Mr. Scotto, an undertaker in neighboring Carroll Gardens who has fought for a generation to clean up the Gowanus, sees the area around the canal becoming a national demonstration site for dealing with abandoned industrial lands.
"Something bold has to be done there," said Ronald Shiffman, who has studied the area as a city planning commissioner and planning professor at Pratt Institute. Citing experiences in Italy and Spain, he hopes that artists and artisans can be attracted to the abandoned industrial buildings along the canal.
Community advocates, borough officials and Brooklyn politicians and a small but growing number of local businessmen share the vision. "We've been working on this for 20 years," said Judge Michael L. Pesce, who successfully campaigned for the State Senate on the the issue of Gowanus pollution in the 1970's. "We now see a way to a solution."
But the first step toward fulfilling these grand dreams, cleaning up the canal, is not easy. Time and again, officials have predicted great things. "I can visualize right now a clean pristine body of water, lined with condominiums," said Chris Beck, as he began his duties as the new regional director of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency in 1977.
Two years later nothing had happened, and Nick Monte, who owned the now-defunct Monte's Venetian Room restaurant along the canal, was urging that it be filled with cement. The city routinely dumped truckloads of chlorine into the water when the odor became overpowering. The worst of the Gowanus problems, being a dumping ground for the city's raw sewage, ended only in 1989 when the Red Hook sewage treatment plant was finally finished.
"It's been neglected a long time," said Alfred Allegretti, president of Bayside Fuel Oil Depot Corporation, the only business still using the Gowanus regularly. "It's going to take a major restoration."
An unusual technical team has come together to do exactly that. Led by Mr. Scotto's group and local politicians, it brings together the expertise of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Its mission is to take the filthy grime dredged from the canal, which includes organic waste and heavy metals, as well as the polluted soil from surrounding industrial sites, and make a glasslike material from it.
 
Liability Concerns
 In the process, known as vitrification, the dangerous materials will be encapsulated in a glasslike compound, and products like bricks and tile made from the new material. The process, which is also being tested with high-level radioactive waste, is promising enough that the city Department of Environmental Protection is spending $200,000 to evaluate it. It is also an opportunity for scientists to find community endeavors to replace weapons programs, a key goal of the Federal Energy Department, which finances Brookhaven.
"If you could demonstrate in the Gowanus that there are possible solutions to this problem, the model could be applied to places such as the Detroit River; Oakland, Calif.; Bridgeport, Conn., and New York Harbor," said Dr. Ivor Preiss, professor of chemical and nuclear engineering at Rensselaer.
A bigger difficulty in reclaiming the Gowanus may be economic. Because of liability concerns, companies are often unwilling to invest money in development projects on land polluted by prior owners. "Once you invest, you have liabilities of an unknown nature," said Kathy Wylde, president of the New York Housing Partnership, which about a decade ago pulled back from building middle-income housing along the canal.
Ms. Wylde said the canal also highlights the question of what to do with polluted sites whose problems are not severe enough to be covered by the Federal Superfund list. "How do we reclaim vast areas of the inner city when we can't finance development?" she asked. She said that in searching for new places to build housing, her organization has repeatedly encountered problems with polluted land.
 
Hopes for Demonstration Site
 Some states have already answered this question, and toxic liability legislation that could apply to the Gowanus is expected to be introduced in the New York State Legislature next year. Connecticut passed a law in July calling for the state to use bond money to buy derelict sites, conduct environmental reviews and then clean up the sites. Then the state will rent out the sites to reimburse itself for the costs of cleanup.
New Jersey, by contrast, has a voluntary program for companies to clean up their own sites. It then certifies that the cleanup was conducted by its standards, thus limiting potential liability.
The big hope of the Gowanus community development group is that the canal will be chosen as a demonstration site under several bills before Congress. Under one proposal a demonstration site chosen for cleanup would receive $300 million over three years.
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee last May, Mr. Scotto said what is titled the Abandoned Land Reuse Act of 1993 could "prove to be of immeasurable value to my community's 20-year-long struggle to rehabilitate Brooklyn's historic Gowanus Canal area."
But first things first. Before the Gowanus buzzes with water taxis and is dotted with ethnic entertainment spots and restaurants, it first must address the pollution in the canal itself. To fix the flushing tunnel and the propeller that drives it, the city has appropriated $5 million this fiscal year.
By the fall of 1995, the renovated system will churn into operation, and it is conceivable some of the material that needs to be dredged will be made into reusable glasslike material by the Brookhaven-Rensselaer team. And it is promised the water will smell and look more attractive -- at least good enough to meet state water quality standards.
But some of the residue on the bottom will not be affected by the water beginning to flow again. It will just sit there. As always, Gowanus solutions will be imperfect.
"You're killing the symptoms, not the illness," said Robert Gaffoglio, the city environmental official in charge of the project.

HEADLINE: Slump in Business Lending Has Prime Rate Stuck at 6%

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
While the Clinton Administration counts on low interest rates to revive the economy, the banking industry is coming to a different conclusion: The demand for loans to expand business activity is so weak that lowering the prime rate is not worth their while.
"Simply stated, my customers don't borrow more because we lower rates; they borrow if they see an opportunity to use the borrowed money, and they don't see that opportunity," said Frank Lourenso, an executive vice president at Chemical Bank. His view was echoed in a half-dozen interviews with other bank executives and industry officials. 
 As the most publicized of bank lending rates, the prime serves as the peg for setting rates on tens of billions of dollars in home equity loans and, above all, on loans to small companies, which account for 20 percent of all business borrowing. The fact that the prime has been stuck at 6 percent for 15 months -- while other interest rates have fallen sharply -- has meant that many small companies have not even had an opportunity to borrow at declining rates, in the event that some might have wanted to do so.
 
Strategy Is Questioned
 The reluctance of banks to lower the prime now -- despite their recent campaigns to encourage borrowing by small companies -- is one more sign of the difficulties in using lower rates to generate strong economic activity.
Interest rates have fallen, of course, for mortgages and for corporations large enough to borrow outside the banking system, at rates below the prime rate. But Federal Reserve data show that the lower rates have generated very little net increase in lending this year in these sectors and in most other sectors of the economy.
Interest rates on mortgages, for example, are at their lowest levels since the 1960's. Even so, home sales and home construction have not risen enough to help lift the economy as strongly as in previous recoveries -- although Alan S. Blinder, a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, insists that low rates will convert the present slow economic growth to accelerated growth by next year.
For the moment, however, the prime rate's stickiness limits the impact of the Administration's lower-rate strategy. And the banks show no sign of dropping the prime, despite the existence of an unusually wide spread between what banks pay in interest for deposits and for other funds that the banks borrow and then lend out at the prime. That spread has widened from less than 1.5 percentage points in 1989 to about 2 percentage points in July 1992, when the prime was last lowered, to more than 3 percentage points since late last year.
"The banks have room to lower the prime now, if that were in their best interest," said John LaWare, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, who specializes in banking issues for the board. "Their earnings are exuberant and their capital positions are strong, but they are not going to lower the prime if they do not believe that will increase their loan volume, and they do not believe it will."
 
Reason for Reluctance
 One problem is that because businesses are reluctant to borrow, the banks see a lower prime as costing them money, not increasing their income by attracting more business. Chemical Bank, a big lender to small business, has more than $10 billion in loans outstanding at interest rates that vary with the prime, usually costing the borrower up to one percentage point over prime. That spread has fallen in recent months as Chemical, like other banks, tries to lend more.
But the prime rate has not budged. If it were to come down to, say, 5.75 percent, interest income from outstanding loans would drop automatically by a quarter of a percentage point.
Such income losses occur whenever the prime drops, and it has fallen from 11.5 percent in June 1989 to 6 percent, where it has been since July 2, 1992. In the past, however, these losses have been offset by a jump in bank income from new borrowers attracted partly by the lower prime rate, but mostly by the opportunity to use the borrowed money for expansion and higher profits. Now this offset is missing.
Surveys by the National Federation of Independent Business show that borrowing by its 600,000 members, mostly small companies, is at a 20-year low. "The reason is that their mood is sour; I cannot think of a better word," said William Dennis, the federation's director of research.
And Kenneth Guenther, the executive director of the Independent Bankers Association, representing the country's thousands of smaller banks, added, "When I go to bankers' meetings, the major problem on the table is that good loan demand is not there."
The prime rate's stickiness came to public attention in mid-September when several small banks lowered their prime to 5.75 percent, and no one else followed suit. "We went down early because we felt that the prime will go down eventually, and we have made the decision to be the price leader in Virginia," said Peggy Cummings, the director of investor relations at Central Fidelity Bank in Richmond, one of those banks.
Being the price leader has brought Central Fidelity dozens of inquiries since mid-September from potential new borrowers, but so far no measurable increase in new loans pegged to the prime. Such loans now total $750 million at Central Fidelity, or 18 percent of the bank's loan portfolio.
What has improved -- by accident -- is mortgage lending. "People have been calling our branches and saying, 'I hear your mortgage rates are down'," Ms. Cummings said. "Our employees explain that our mortgage rates have not dropped, our prime has. But the calls opened up conversations, and we were able to do new business on mortgages."
Beyond lack of demand, bankers say cutting the prime below 6 percent would be impractical for them. As Richard J. Boyle, the vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, and others explain it, a bank's present costs make a 6 percent prime a base for profitable loans. But a lower prime would mean that a bank could earn similar income with less risk and cost by investing in Treasury notes that pay interest of 4.5 percent to 5 percent annually.
Or banks that already devote huge sums to consumer lending, might devote even more, at a time when consumers have been borrowing more, particularly through their credit cards and through other short-term credit. Most rates charged to consumers are still above 10 percent.
The Federal Reserve, of course, could change the equation by acting to lower interest rates again. That would in turn give banks even more room than they already have to reduce the prime rate, by reducing what they pay in interest on deposits and on other funds the banks then lend at the prime rate. But Fed officials have suggested that they will not act soon, if at all, given the Fed's concern about a reappearance of inflation, which it would fight by raising rates.
"The Fed's view," said David Jones, the chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street firm, "is that it is not prudent to twist bankers' arms to lower the prime rate, because the Fed may turn right around in the not too distant future and raise rates, which would force banks to turn around real quickly and raise them, too."

Son Of Synfuels

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Who is the most powerful business executive in the United States today?
She is Dr. Mary Good, President Clinton's Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, who has quietly been designated czar of the U.S. automobile industry.
The heads of her divisions -- G.M., Ford and Chrysler -- are delighted with the Government's friendly takeover. These newly middle managers no longer bear responsibility for R.& D., can relax about antitrust, and can forget about the old competition among one another and from abroad. Fatigued by the stress of capitalist risk? Dr. Good will see you now. 
 Corporate statism arrived in America last week in the back seat of a dream car. The White House announced "a historic new partnership aimed at strengthening U.S. competitiveness by developing technologies for a new generation of vehicles." Triple the fuel efficiency; ultra-capacitors from despised "Star Wars" projects; stealth-technology windows; "virtual design and prototyping from the Army Tank Command."
And here's the beauty part: it's all free! "This project will not increase the Government's total spending on research," promises the White House. But somehow, as "Government money will be spent on riskier, longer-term projects," the Washington-Detroit axle will "produce competitively priced, high-performance, low-pollution, safe vehicles."
Do you believe that? The presumed guardians of free enterprise do. I called the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, whose president, Richard Lesher, called it "a step forward. It makes sense for the Government to work with industry to advance the public good." At the National Association of Manufacturers, President Jerry Jasinowski said: "This agreement to improve manufacturing techniques seems generally reasonable."
What a marriage: the Washington-knows-best set of liberal Democrats going down the primrose path of industrial policy with a posterior-protecting bunch of corporate managers and business lobbyists who think they can get government money and management without government control.
Mr. Clinton is making no secret of his policy of half-free enterprise. Following the R.& D. takeover of the auto industry, he announced the taxpayer bailout of the leaky shipbuilding industry, piling billions in new liability on today's economywide $6 trillion in loan guarantees.
Then the 800-pound gorilla groom gave its blushing corporate bride a wedding present: an export-subsidy policy to join -- rather than continue to fight -- the nations that use tax money to prop up inefficient industry.
Why is the power-to-the-center crowd in Washington able to get away with this radical restructuring of the American economy?
Because fat-cat managers and their nail-nibbling lobbyists love it. Who wants to risk failure, hostile takeover and accountability by the bottom line -- when an eager government is ready to relieve you of the rigors of competition? Only entrepreneurs object, and those non-team players are too busy creating new industries and jobs to join the hired managers at the public trough.
Can you imagine a self-starter with a far-out invention going up against the Big Three Plus the Bigger One? The Det-Wash deal to monopolize R.& D. eliminates innovative outsiders and makes a mockery of antitrust.
Do you remember Synfuels, the cockamamie Carter-era solution to high oil prices? Our super-efficient Government created a giant corporation to produce oil out of rocks, with big business's blessing. After a decade of taxpayer losses in the billions, Synfuels was quietly folded up because the free market brought down prices with no government help.
Proponents of today's "partnership" cloak their takeover in the rhetoric of savings on research, promotion of exports, job creation, all those good things competent executives do better than bureaucrats. Ironically, we're aping Japan just when the terrible weakness of the protective Japanese system is becoming manifest.
Who will save the free enterprise system from Dr. Do-good?
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is paralyzed by fear of indictment; the department's top level is wandering about unconfirmed; and its bureaucracy is disconnected from policy. Fortunately, this is the outfit charged with leading us into Clintonism's brave new world. That is how God protects drunks and the free market.

HEADLINE: Who Says College Can Only Last Four Years?;
Consider the Negatives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 29 Education page article on completing college in three years makes some interesting points about receiving a bachelor's degree in three years versus the traditional four. Despite the perceived economic benefit in the expedited degree, the negatives should be considered. 
 The idea is noteworthy if the intent of a college is primarily to certify a student for a position in the work force. The concept makes far less sense if one main objective of a university is to help a student grow as a person, spend thoughtful time formulating values and develop a broad outlook on life.
Involvement in campus activities, including social activities, is critical in maturation and likely to be lost in the three-year scenario. Jettisoning these important pursuits may be of questionable value to some students.
Economic realities are squeezing everyone -- from parents and students to faculty members and administrators. But for most students, particularly those coming to college directly from high school, attending a university is more than the number of hours they spend in the classroom.
I fully support exploration of the proposition of a three-year degree program, but let us not lose sight of the negatives that are associated with this concept.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Foreign Policy Morass

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS BOSTON

 BODY:
The world has caught up with Bill Clinton. If you ever believed that as President he could keep his attention on domestic affairs, that illusion is gone. Russia, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia: The list of foreign crises is growing, and they will not go away.
For two reasons foreign policy is a difficult area for this President. One lies in himself, the other in the nature of international problems today. 
 "Somehow," The Economist wrote two weeks ago, "the fire is not in Mr. Clinton's belly when he speaks on foreign policy." Anyone who heard him on health care and on Somalia will understand. On health he was sure on his facts, confident, enthusiastic. On Somalia he seemed tentative, fuzzy, unconvincing.
Of course Somalia is a complicated problem. But so is the issue of national health care; there Mr. Clinton may not have the perfect solution, but he is so informed and committed that he communicates his conviction.
In our democracy, foreign policy must have public support to be successful. And the nature of the problems in the world makes it much harder to get that support now than in recent decades.
For 40 years after World War II most Americans saw Communism as a menacing danger to our security and freedom, and they supported programs to oppose it. The Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, Korea, Berlin, even far-fetched Grenada: Presidents could rally public support in the Manichaean framework of the cold war.
Now there is no great enemy. Instead there are brutal internal conflicts and humanitarian crises. To rally Americans for intervention in those matters is difficult. Indeed fewer and fewer Americans have any interest in foreign affairs.
President Bush, goaded by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, managed to rouse support for war on Iraq. He exaggerated: Saddam Hussein was "worse than Hitler." But the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was undisguised aggression, and the threat to Western oil supplies did present a risk to national security.
To intervene effectively in any conflict abroad a President must persuade the public that the United States has a national security interest there. President Clinton did so in the Russian crisis and did it well. From the first, clearly and consistently, he called for support of President Yeltsin as the best hope of building democracy and preventing a renewed threat to our interests from Moscow.
Somalia is the opposite case. It presents no threat to American security. I favored the dispatch of American forces last year to prevent mass starvation, not foreseeing the larger political difficulties that have arisen. But Mr. Clinton's policy to deal with them, sending more troops while swearing to pull them all out by March, is muddled and unconvincing. What good are we doing? What is our interest? Americans do not know and hence do not support the policy.
But President Clinton's worst failure in foreign policy has been in Bosnia. The humanitarian interest is obvious when hundreds of thousands of people have been raped, murdered and driven from their homes because of their religion. But there is also a powerful security interest.
The greatest challenge that has emerged in the post-cold-war world is ethnic conflict. Freed from the constraints of the superpower rivalry, ethnic groups in the Balkans and the former Soviet republics have turned on each other with terrifying savagery. What is happening threatens to destroy the European stability that is so essential to America.
Bosnia was the place to draw the line. It was the victim, like Kuwait, of open aggression. Serbian ethnic cleansing was more Hitlerian than anything Saddam Hussein did. Bob Dole was right when he told President Clinton last summer that in terms of our national security interest we should get out of Somalia and get into Bosnia.
Mr. Clinton could have stopped the aggression against Bosnia if he had acted forcefully soon after taking office, making clear to Slobodan Milosevic that we would bomb Serbian forces if they continued their sieges and massacres. Instead he deferred to appeasers in Britain and France.
A President who wants to focus on domestic affairs must put foreign policy in a framework that Americans understand and that makes them feel secure. President Clinton still has that job ahead of him.

HEADLINE: Showdown: The Populist Vs. the Fed

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
The champions of two very different American schools of thought will do battle this week when Henry B. Gonzalez, a torchbearer of Texas populism, enters the ring against Alan Greenspan, guardian of central bank independence.
After months of planning, Mr. Gonzalez, the 77-year-old chairman of the House Banking Committee, has begun his most vigorous offensive ever to inject more democracy and accountability into the Federal Reserve, which has been insulated from political pressures for six decades.
 
Rare Hearing
 He has planned a series of hearings to make the central bankers feel maximum heat: Not only has he called Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to testify on Wednesday, but he has called all 12 members of the Fed's main policy-making committee to a rare mass hearing on Oct. 19. 
 The bill he is pushing aims to remove what he sees as two blots on American democracy: the way that private bankers and business executives, rather than the President, appoint several main Fed policy makers, and the way the central bank makes its decisions in secrecy. Mr. Gonzalez talks of the central bank as an elite, secretive club that is often unresponsive to the public's demand for faster growth.
"I am very determined about reforming the Fed," Mr. Gonzalez said in an interview. "This is no subterfuge. If the Fed became more accountable to the public on its own, it would be cause for celebration. But chairman Greenspan has stoutly resisted even the least suggestion of change."
Although Mr. Gonzalez has flooded the news media with press releases over the last year lambasting the Fed for doing too little to spur growth, he asserts that his new campaign is not intended to assert political (read Democratic) control over the central bank's conservative policy makers. All he says he wants is to remove some undemocratic warts from the Fed's structure.
But Mr. Greenspan isn't eager to buy what Mr. Gonzalez is selling. Fed officials say a central bank works best when it is most independent, and many view Mr. Gonzalez's plotting as a transparent effort to bring the Fed to heel.
 
View on Inflation
 Fed officials declined to respond to Mr. Gonzalez's offensive until Mr. Greenspan testifies on Wednesday. But several central bank officials are known to think that having the President appoint -- and the Senate confirm -- the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve regional banks would make it harder for the Fed to clamp down on inflation.
Federal Reserve officials say they think that having the President name the regional bank presidents would make them more responsive to political winds, meaning they would probably tilt toward faster growth, rather than lower inflation. If one's goal is to minimize inflation, Fed officials reason, then a sure way to achieve that goal is to have private bankers -- who are among the world's fiercest inflation hawks -- appoint the regional bank presidents.
On a rotating basis, 5 of the 12 regional bank presidents sit on the Fed's chief policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee. The other seats are held by the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, all of whom have 14-year terms and are appointed by the President.
Now that Mr. Gonzalez has finished his work on a savings and loan bailout, he is picking up the populist torch passed him by Wright Patman, the late Texas Democrat and Fed tormentor who used to head the House Banking Committee. (When Mr. Greenspan testifies Wednesday, Mr. Gonzalez will have a decided home court advantage -- the hearing room is named after Mr. Patman.)
"Like chairman Patman, I'm not worried about taking on an icon," Mr. Gonzalez said. "The Federal Reserve has evolved into an entity in and unto itself and now believes it has no relationship to the rest of the Government." In this battle Mr. Gonzalez at times seemed to be being playing David to the Fed's Goliath. But Mr. Gonzalez should not be dismissed as a lightweight, his supporters say. They point to the way he doggedly alerted the nation about one of the biggest foreign policy blunders of the Bush Administration -- its approval of loans to Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
"For Henry, reforming the Fed is a crusade he believes in very deeply," said Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat on the House Banking Committee. "He has often been underrated in the past."
Nonetheless, Mr. Gonzalez faces an uphill battle. The Fed is already working behind the scenes to organize battalions of bankers to howl about efforts to politicize the central bank.
The Fed is crying wolf, Mr. Gonzalez's allies say. "If you want to fix a door jamb at the Federal Reserve, they say you're part of a building demolition crew," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota.
Another problem Mr. Gonzalez faces is that while his bill has 20 co-sponsors, most of them liberal Democrats, some moderate Democrats oppose it.
"I work by the theory that if it ain't broke, don't fix it," said Charles E. Schumer, an influential Brooklyn Democrat on the House Banking Committee who opposes the Gonzalez bill. "Over all, the Fed has done a good job. Monetary policy should be structured so it is not subject to the short-term vicissitudes of politics."
But probably the biggest hurdle Mr. Gonzalez faces is President Clinton's opposition. In a letter he sent to Mr. Gonzalez on Sept. 20, the President said he was "disinclined" to support the Gonzalez proposal, saying the Fed "is functioning well and does not need an overhaul just now." He added that the proposed reforms "run the risk of undermining market confidence in the Fed."
Frank Newman, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, said in an interview that Mr. Gonzalez's critique of the Fed was not to be taken lightly. But he said, "It's difficult for us to see that there really is a problem."
"The Fed is independent and that's one of the underlying concepts," he said. "If at some point in time, this policy isn't working well, that's something that could be addressed."
Several respected lawmakers have joined Mr. Gonzalez's cause. Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat who is vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, has proposed stripping the regional bank presidents of their votes so that only the Fed's seven board members would vote on monetary policy.
To improve coordination between the White House and the Fed, Lee H. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat, has proposed allowing Presidents to appoint new Federal Reserve chairmen a year after the Presidents take office. President Clinton cannot appoint a new Fed chairman until Mr. Greenspan's four-year term expires in March 1996.
As with the Gonzalez proposal, Fed officials believe these proposals would eat into the central bank's independence.
 
Proposal on Interest Rates
 Mr. Hamilton has also proposed requiring the Fed to make an immediate announcement when it decides to change its policies on interest rates. At present, the Fed waits until six weeks after its meetings before doing so.
Mr. Gonzalez and his supporters say their fight is not about whether interest rates should be a smidgeon higher or lower, but about the structure of government. "If you take the principles that people are talking about nowadays -- reforming government and opening up government -- the Fed violates it more than any other branch of government," said Mr. Frank, a co-sponsor of the Gonzalez bill. "There are private citizens making national policy, and they do it in secrecy."

Deal Fits Phone Company's Big Plan

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Bell Atlantic's planned $1 billion entry into the Mexican wireless telephone market complements the company's technology strategy and could be the forerunner of a North American and perhaps even a pan-American wireless telephone network led by the regional Bell holding company, analysts said yesterday.
Bell Atlantic said that the Mexican venture was part of an increasingly ambitious wireless and advanced-technology program that includes the personal communications services recently authorized in the United States. But the company said also that it was actively pursuing methods for using cable television networks for two-way communications and standard telephone lines for carrying video programming. 
 "Just because we're in Mexico does not mean we're going to let up on anything else," said Lawrence T. Babbio, chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic Enterprises International, the unit responsible for the company's wireless telecommunications in the United States and abroad.
 
New Zealand Deal Recalled
 Mr. Babbio sees Bell Atlantic's Mexico deal as similar in some ways to its $1.2 billion investment in 1990 in New Zealand Telecom, which was being privatized at the time and had a large wireless business. But unlike that transaction, in which the New Zealand Government required a rapid reduction in Bell Atlantic's ownership stake, the American company plans to eventually increase its holdings in the Mexican company, Iusacell, after it issues its first publicly traded shares.
And compared with New Zealand, Mr. Babbio expects much faster economic growth in Mexico, even if Congress does not approve the North American Free Trade Agreement.
John E. Money, an analyst at the Argus Research Corporation, said Bell Atlantic was in an ideal position to negotiate with cellular carriers in Canada and Latin America carriers to build a pan-American network.
Mr. Babbio said he liked the "sound of the idea," but quickly added, "I have nothing to announce or discuss."
In the short run, investors seemed yesterday to focus on the deal's expected impact on next year's earnings, which would wipe out much of 1994's previously projected earnings rise. Bell Atlantic's stock dropped $2 on the New York Stock Exchange, to $59.375, on relatively modest volume.
Mr. Babbio said that a write-off of good will, a bookkeeping measure related to the Iusacell investment, would dilute earnings by 15 cents to 20 cents a share.
Daniel Reingold, a telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch, had been projecting 1994 earnings at $3.67 a share, compared with estimated 1993 earnings of $3.43 a share. But yesterday he reduced his 1994 estimate to $3.50 a share to reflect the Mexico deal's dilution.
 
Other Bell Stocks Fall
 It was a bad day for two other regional Bells' stock price yesterday. Southwestern Bell, which holds a 10 percent stake in Mexico's largest telecommunications company, Telefonos de Mexico, saw its shares drop $1 on the Big Board to $40.50, also on relatively modest volume. Investors may see Southwestern Bell's stake being hurt by the Bell Atlantic entry.
BellSouth saw its shares drop $1.875, to $58, on modest volume on the Big Board. BellSouth's shares probably dropped in price because of speculation that it might enter the bidding for Paramount Communications on the side of QVC Network Inc., just as the Nynex Corporation entered the battle on the side of Viacom Inc. But BellSouth also has major stakes in smaller Mexican cellular carriers that could be hurt by Iusacell, Bell Atlantic's Mexican partner.
Some analysts tended to view the Bell Atlantic acquisition in terms that are familiar in American cellular deals. Mr. Reingold of Merrill Lynch said the deal reflected an acquisition price of $40 to $45 for each potential cellular subscriber in Mexico, compared with $85 in Germany and more than $175 in the United States.

HEADLINE: In Two Counties, a Struggle to Influence Turnout

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 6

 BODY:
In the largely Democratic counties of Essex and Hudson, a familiar election year tug-of-war is going on: Democrats want a big voter turnout and Republicans are looking for ways to keep the turnout low.
In the past strong Democratic organizations were able to field armies of workers, their enthusiasm buoyed by thousands of dollars in "street money" to get voters to the polls. Republicans countered with tactics such as posting poll watchers, many of them armed off-duty police officers, outside voting places, a tactic they have promised a Federal judge not to repeat. 
 Mayor Sharpe James and Councilman Donald Tucker of Newark said that neither Gov. Jim Florio nor his Republican rival, Christine Todd Whitman, are reaching out to urban constituencies. A rare exception was the candidates' appearances at the recent annual meeting of the New Jersey Black Issues Convention, of which Mr. Tucker is president.
Organizational tasks for both parties are complicated by the fact that once-vaunted political machines are in disarray. In Essex, the County Executive, Thomas J. D'Alessio, who was also the county Democratic chairman when the year began, is under Federal indictment on charges of misusing political contributions.
And in Hudson, a Republican now sits in the Mayor's office in Jersey City, a longtime Democratic stronghold.
 
Whitman Endorsement
 Although Jersey City's Mayor, Bret Schundler, has endorsed Mrs. Whitman, he still finds fault with her campaign, particularly her explanations of her tax reduction plan.
"If Mrs. Whitman loses it will be because she ran a very poor campaign," Mr. Schundler said. "Florio is a target as big as the side of a barn.
Historically, these counties have provided plenty of votes in the Democratic column in statewide races. And Democrats say the Republicans have not given up trying to keep these votes away from Mr. Florio by discouraging participation by minority voters, most of whom are Democrats. State Republican leaders went to court this month to ask that their poll challengers be allowed to check whether voters are registered and voting machines function properly. Black elected officials, led by Representative Donald M. Payne, Democrat of Newark, are calling it another scare tactic.
Republican leaders in Essex also decided not to field any opposition to the two black State Senators and two black Assemblymen who represent Newark and surrounding towns. The Republicans apparently reasoned that such opposition would not only be futile, but might encourage more black Democrats to go to the polls, which could hurt Republican fortunes in other races where they might have a chance.
Mayor James said the Republican Party "wants black voters to go to sleep," and added, "They don't respect Afro-Americans enough to offer them a candidacy on their ticket."
 
'I Think It's Wrong'
 Even State Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican, agreed that his party should have candidates challenging the incumbents. "The county party leaders think it will help them win local freeholder races if they hold down the black vote, but I think it's wrong," he said. "We should have opponents in those races."
The turnout question also was a factor in derailing legislation that would have allowed voters to decide whether they wanted sports betting in Atlantic City casinos, according to the bill's chief sponsor.
State Senator C. Louis Bassano, Republican of Union, said the first thing he was told when his bill passed the Senate and went to the Assembly was that it would not be passed because it would generate a lot of voter interest and pull out large numbers of Democrats. "I said that was absurd, and asked them if they thought only Democrats gambled," Mr. Bassano said.
Assemblyman C. Richard Kamin, Republican of Mount Olive Township, and a member of the Assembly Appropriations Committee that refused to release the bill, said he had questioned the wisdom of putting the sports betting question on the ballot.
"I said it would bring in a lot of special interest money and increase voter turnout," he said. "And I asked whether we wanted to get into a numbers game given the difference in party registrations."
Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, Republican of Independence, denied that concerns over arousing Democratic voters had anything to do with the bill's fate. "I opposed the bill on the merits and would have put it up for a vote if the Appropriations Committee had released it," he said.
 
Positive Responses to Florio
 Random interviews with registered voters on their way to work or shopping in Newark and Jersey City showed that Mr. Florio's ban on assault weapons is standing him in good stead, as are his proposals to tighten requirements for receiving welfare. The interviews also showed that Mrs. Whitman still must convince voters she has the ability and experience to be governor and that her proposal to reduce state income taxes for low and middle-income taxpayers by 30 percent is credible.
Gail Phillips, who was walking through the PATH Station in Journal Square on her way to a job interview, knows about losing a job. She worked as a buyer and assistant manager at a Macy's outlet until the retail giant filed for Chapter 11 protection and closed several stores. But Ms. Phillips said she still supports the Governor. "I like Mrs. Whitman and her support for women's lib, but I think the Governor has done a good job and has the experience." As for Mr. Florio's sponsorship of a $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990? "We'll always have taxes," she said.
Nisa McCord of Bayonne, a legal secretary who was posting some letters at a mail box in the PATH concourse, said she is worried about the state's high unemployment rate and taxes and said she will "probably" vote for Mrs. Whitman." "You have to look at where we are and base your decision on that," she said.
Hector Mercado, an artist and the owner of Rascals, a clothing store three blocks from City Hall in Jersey City, said Mr. Florio is doing a good job. "I support his ban on guns all the way, that's number one," he said. "She has no experience."
 
'We Need a Woman'
 But across the street, Millie Rivera, who was slicing loaves of bread at a Subway sandwich shop, one of two jobs she holds to support her family and raise her 10-year-old daughter, saw the need for a change. "We need more jobs and we have to do more to stop the sale of drugs on the street, and to give young people something to do besides hang out on the street corners." For these reasons she said, "I don't think I'll vote for Florio. We need a woman who will understand these things."
Richard Cardiello, owner of the Ironbound Gym and the new owner of the Ultimate Bagel Delicatessen, which he will rename Richie's Restaurant and Deli, said he would stay home on election day. "I don't think I'm going to vote, because every time I do I get the wrong guy," he said. "I think Florio's a jerk because of his anti-gun stand, and I think she's probably against guns too."

"We need a woman who will understand these things," she said about the problems of families and unemployment. Hector Mercado, the owner of a clothing store near City Hall in Jersey City, says Mr. Florio is doing a good job. "I support his ban on guns all the way, that's number one," he said.

HEADLINE: Americans Rush to Funds That Invest Abroad

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
It was partly the sight of construction on a four-lane highway in the lush paradise of Bali several years ago that aroused Arie Kurtzig's interest in investing his money overseas.
"They're basically doing the same things we did 20, 30, 40 years ago -- building apartments, roads, sewers, oil refineries and telephone systems," Mr. Kurtzig said, comparing the economy of the Indonesian island, after a fashion, to that of the United States. "That's what's going to be behind their massive economic growth over the next 20 years." 
 Shortly after his visit, Mr. Kurtzig, a 49-year-old Silicon Valley resident who sold his computer touch-screen company five years ago, joining what has now become a gold rush of Americans who invest some of their money overseas by buying shares in mutual funds with assets that are solely or largely foreign.
Discouraged by low-yielding investments at home and attracted by high returns in quick-growing overseas economies like China, Chile and other countries, Americans are growing increasingly bold about investing abroad -- especially in the countries that were once called third-world or underdeveloped areas but are now often referred to by funds as "emerging markets."
And investment advisers say that while this money will clearly help the recipient economies and the bank balances of the investors, there is a downside for the United States stock market: The growing trend is reducing the money available for investment in the United States at a time when a record number of American companies are taking advantage of a bullish market to go public.
In August, foreign-oriented mutual funds collected $5.4 billion from investors. That was nearly half of all mutual-fund investments, and a monthly figure that rose from $3.1 billion in July, the previous record, according to the Investment Company Institute, which tracks mutual fund investments. In 1992, such funds took in $6.9 billion, then an annual record. So far this year, $17.4 billion has poured in.
Mutual funds in general remain hugely popular among American investors -- one in four American households invests in mutual funds, and nearly half of all fund owners earn less than $50,000 a year.
But the foreign-oriented ones are growing at a much faster rate than domestic ones. Total mutual fund assets grew by 18 percent in the first six months of the year, while total foreign-oriented mutual fund assets grew by 35 percent.
Despite the explosive growth, assets in foreign-oriented funds represent just one-tenth of all assets held in mutual funds by American investors. And despite its current attractiveness, investing abroad can still hold big risks, from the potential for political instability in some countries to the shortage of regulations to protect investors and the relative lack of investment information.
While momentum in international investment has been gathering for some time, the spring and summer saw intense growth in this area. Joining people like Mr. Kurtzig in the international arena were comparative newcomers like Paul Feldman, 36, a lending officer for a bank in Manhattan, who started putting money in foreign-oriented mutual funds about three or four months ago.
"I feel that growth rates of emerging markets and their economies will far exceed the U.S. market or even the European market," Mr. Feldman said. "If you're willing to sit back and ride out the ups and downs, there's more of an upside for the emerging market economies than there is for the existing, well-established economies."
There are many kinds of mutual funds, a hugely popular kind of investment made of pools of stocks, bonds or other securities that are managed by a professional investment company. These funds may specialize in, say, energy stocks, municipal bonds, or investment in a country like Mexico or a region like Latin America.
Some mutual fund companies have benefited more than others from the leap in foreign investment. At T. Rowe Price, which is based in Baltimore, 74 percent of the money that investors put into Price mutual funds in the first eight months of the year was earmarked for international investments, Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for Price, said. Even more surprising, Mr. Norwitz said, in August about 94 percent of the new money investors gave to T. Rowe Price was destined for international funds.
 
Market Forces Working
 At Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund giant in Boston, Neal Litvak, the executive vice president of marketing, said the flow of international investment had been driven by market forces: Foreign companies and governments offer high yields to investors to compete for cash against, say, United States Treasury bonds or American corporate debt that might carry lower risks for the investor.
Also, increasing privatization and growth in previously stagnant economies in various parts of the third world are making overseas investing more palatable to American investors who are normally averse to risk. Low labor costs, industrial policies designed to foster growth and strong work ethics add to the package, making investors less nervous about the risks associated with nascent stock markets, experiments with capitalism and the occasional military coup.
Since many investors believe the stock market in the United States is overpriced and perhaps cruising for a fall, the big attraction of international plays, of course, is the potential for a high yield or, at least, more and better bargains overseas. As Mr. Norwitz said, the flow of money into Price's international funds "reflects concerns about potentially high valuations in the U.S. equity market."
Greg Johnson, the vice president of marketing for the Franklin-Templeton group of funds in San Mateo, Calif., said Americans were increasingly comfortable with buying abroad.
"There's not a fear of investing in international stocks like there might have been five years ago -- now it's a realistic alternative for the American investor," he said.
 
Track Records Don't Count
 While many of these funds appear to be generating fairy-tale returns, many international funds that are performing so well this year were flat or weak gainers last year, given the fact that the United States stock market has outperformed most foreign markets for the last several years.
Further, all investors need to memorize this sentence from advertisements for mutual funds: "Past performance is no guarantee of future results."
Both the Fidelity and T. Rowe Price Japan funds are up about 38 percent since Jan. 1 of this year, but about half that gain is attributable to a stronger yen, and at least some of the rest to efforts by the Japanese Government to strengthen the stock market, rather than underlying robustness in the Japanese economy. Anyone who had $1,000 in either Japan fund as of Jan. 1 and wanted to sell now would get $1,380. But the next several months are unlikely to see such gains.
It is also true that there is a vast difference between the risk of investing in, say, Canada and Brazil. Fund advisers can talk very casually about "event risk," which means an earthquake or revolution or other unpleasant incident could wipe out all gains. This serves to prove the investing adage that high rewards are almost always accompanied by high risks.
"Sometimes people jump in blindfolded; they close their eyes to the risks and the increased volatility that tends to accompany an international investment, and they get burned," Mr. Litvak said. "We need to make sure that to the extent that people are taking a first step, they take it in a diversified fund, as opposed to a country fund or a regional fund, which is going to be susceptible to event risk, particularly in the emerging market."
And how are the investors doing? Dr. Earle Rosenberg, 64, an oral surgeon from Wellesley, Mass., who has been investing in foreign-oriented mutual funds for a couple of years, says his Fidelity Latin America fund "is going gangbusters" -- it is up about 20 percent since he invested in the spring. His Fidelity Canada fund is up 14.4 percent from Jan. 1, and the Fidelity International fund is up at least 15 percent since he invested in the spring.
Dr. Rosenberg said he regretted not investing in Asia, and added that he kept 20 percent of his assets in international funds and the rest in domestic assets.
From his initial interest in Bali, Mr. Kurtzig now has about 15 percent of his assets overseas, though he said he plans to go no higher than 25 percent. He has the T. Rowe Price Japan fund, which was a 38 percent gainer, he said, as well as a New Asia fund with a 33.5 percent gain, and a Europe fund with a 16.3 percent gain this year.
Robert Trudeau, 52, of Corona, Calif., the president of a company that makes controls for heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment, said he had "the best investing year of my life this year without much play in the U.S. market."
He started international investing gingerly late last year, and now has 50 percent of his portfolio overseas. The other 50 percent is in cash, and nothing is in the United States equity market because, he says, "we had a long string of good news, and it's just going to take a precipitating factor to bring it back to reality." He added, "That will come along one of these mornings, as it inevitably does."
 
Cash Leaving America
 As Mr. Trudeau's pattern suggests, the flow of international money can easily pull cash away from the American economy. Michael Metz, the chief portfolio strategist for Oppenheimer & Company, said: "What this means for the U.S. is that instead of all these savings going into domestic securities, a lot of it's leaking out into foreign securities. This eliminates perhaps the only source of strength in the domestic stock market, which is mutual fund demand."
Meanwhile, money from individual American investors is helping capital-hungry companies and governments overseas. What used to be government-to-government foreign aid, Mr. Metz said, is now something more like capitalist-to-capitalist aid.
"In the long term, that's really what a smart government should depend upon -- not being attractive to another political entity, but being attractive to capital around the world," Mr. Metz said. "Maybe they can't get a handout from the American Government, but they can put out a lure to American capital."

HEADLINE: U.S. Official in Plea to Pension Funds

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
At a time when institutional investors have pressured American corporations to lay off thousands of workers, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is seeking to persuade these powerful investors to soften their stance.
Mr. Reich, who brought his campaign to a New York gathering last week of managers of the nation's biggest pension funds, believes that investors should begin to look beyond numbers and add nonfinancial criteria to decide which stocks to buy. 
 In doing so, Mr. Reich adds his voice to a growing chorus urging that nonfinancial measures -- such as how a company treats its workers -- might be as useful in predicting corporate performance as traditional balance sheet analysis.
His message was delivered to the Council of Institutional Investors, a trade group representing large corporate and public pension funds, the agents seen as most responsible for the large number of layoffs at such companies as I.B.M., Eastman Kodak and Sears, Roebuck & Company.
 
A Bottom-Line Mentality
 In demanding better returns, these big instititutional shareholders -- which own more than half the stocks in the nation -- have put pressure on companies to cut lagging operations and restructure their operations. The goal has been to increase profits and stock prices, but the cost has been the loss of thousands of jobs and a stubbornly high unemployment rate.
"I am questioning whether we have gone too far in corporate downsizing," Mr. Reich told council members. "Cutting payrolls may not be the most effective way of improving corporate performance. There are a lot of nonfinancial criteria that don't show up on a balance sheet and are hard to get your hands on."
The remarks by Mr. Reich focused on workplace issues, but his thoughts reflect a growing discussion among big institutional investors that overreliance on balance-sheet ratios -- for instance, return on capital, assets and invested capital -- ignores a human dimension that can affect long-term corporate performance. Moreover, this approach may result in large-scale layoffs that can hurt the economy and reduce demand for the products of American companies.
"Of course, at the end of the day institutional investors are fiduciaries and have to care about return to shareholders," said James E. Heard, president of Institutional Shareholder Services, a pension consulting firm. "But they are becoming more interested in how companies get to be good companies and winners. Part of understanding that process is to look at the issue of human capital."
To help institutional investors, the Department of Labor, which regulates corporate pension funds, will be issuing a set of questions that institutional investors can use to judge one workplace against another.
Behind the approach is the sense that rigorous methodology is needed on such "soft" issues, lest underperforming companies use a good track record with employees to justify or mask poor corporate performance.
Dale Hanson, chief executive of the California Public Employees Retirement System, which manages $70 billion in assets, said that the debate was a "response to the unprecedented amount of white-collar unemployment."
Mr. Hanson said that he was "willing to look at nonfinancial indicators" and supported efforts to "put a value on the human side of the corporation." But, he warned, "it won't be an easy process."
To explain the human-dimension approach, Mr. Reich said he is not suggesting companies be allowed "to pursue slothful ways." Rather, he urges that other methods be devised in place of simply lopping off lagging divisions.
In large part, Mr. Reich acknowledged that his quest for an alternative management model was motivated by the drag that long-term employment put on the economy. Corporate layoffs in September reached 2,000 a day; the percentage of workers still unemployed after six months is at a post-World War II high, and the amount spent by state and Federal governments on unemployment compensation reached $35 billion last year.
Many institutional shareholders accepted Mr. Reich's views as an addition to fundamental financial analysis, but not as a substitute.
"This won't supplement traditional financial analysis," said Peter Gilbert, chief investment officer of the Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System. "But it could be another helpful tool." His $13 billion fund already takes nonfinancial matters into consideration.
Ash Williams Jr., executive director of the Florida State Board of Administration, offered another reason why institutional investors ought to heed the Labor Secretary: companies with good workplace practices tend to have good stock performance. "This isn't just social engineering, it's good business," he said.

HEADLINE: Plant to Close, Leaving Workers Seeking Jobs

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OSSINING, N.Y., Oct. 7

 BODY:
From guitar strings to jumbo jets to smart buildings, Hudson International Conductors helped wire the 20th century. For almost 90 years, the factory on the banks of the Hudson River here has churned out wire for successive waves of technology.
Now Hudson is keeping up with a new trend: the decline of manufacturing in the Northeast. 
 Later this month, the company will close its factories here and in Walden, N.Y., and consolidate its manufacturing operations at its plant in Inman, S.C. The move will leave most of its employees looking for work in a region that is bleeding manufacturing jobs.
"I guess we are all caught up in the same thing," said Richard Carey, a 49-year-old Peekskill resident who worked for the company for 30 years. "The economy, or whatever it is. G.M., I.B.M., they're all doing the same thing. There are no jobs around in the immediate area."
 
All-Time Low in August
 Spinning copper cables into wire was the only job Mr. Carey ever had, and the only one he ever expected to have. When he signed on at Hudson International Conductors, then known as the Hudson Wire Company, Mr. Carey was fresh out of high school. Hudson Wire was the kind of place where families worked together. Mr. Carey joined his late brother Jimmy on line at the factory. Eleven years ago, he brought his stepson, Donald, into the ranks of what was the largest employer in the Village of Ossining. Now they are both unemployed.
Manufacturing throughout the region is in free fall, said Frank M. Surdey, regional economist for the State Department of Labor in Binghamton. Global competition, the end of the cold war, labor-saving technology and the migration of jobs to cheaper areas are the four primary reasons for the decline, he said.
In Westchester County, manufacturing hit an all-time low in August, with 46,200 jobs reported, a drop of 5.9 percent from the same time last year, Mr. Surdey said. In comparison, there were 74,000 manufacturing jobs in Westchester in 1981.
At Hudson Wire, only 35 executives and engineers, out of 225 employees, will continue to work in Ossining, where the company plans to keep its headquarters and research and development centers, said the company's president Robert Akin 3d.
At the start of this year, Hudson Wire had 118 manufacturing employees. Of those, 18 will relocate to South Carolina. In Walden, about half the company's 19 workers will be laid off, and only a warehouse will remain.
 
'Another Person Gone'
 Piece by piece, the machines were trucked south over the summer. As the equipment went, the jobs followed. Teams of workers have been let go from Hudson Wire almost weekly since the end of June.
"This is like Chinese water torture," Mr. Akin said. "Every day, there's another person gone, another machine gone."
For those who will remain with the company, the choice to move to South Carolina was not easy.
Fred Didomizio of Croton-on-Hudson has worked for Hudson Wire for 35 years. At 58, he was too close to retirement to walk away from the company. He accepted the transfer, but still toys with the idea of early retirement. His move has temporarily divided his family. His wife, Karan, decided not to go.
"I can't see moving away," she said. "I don't think I could take it. My children are here. My grandchildren are here. I have a job here."
Mr. Akin, the 57-year-old president of Hudson International, is not proud of dismantling the factory that his grandfather, Robert, founded in 1902 and brought to Ossining in 1904.
The company's departure from the Northeast is, in part, a tale of 1980's expansion squeezed by 1990's limits.
 
More Factories Than Needed
 In 1988, Hudson Wire Company bought out its largest competitor, International Wire Products Company of Inman, S.C. With the purchase, the company got a new name -- Hudson International Conductors -- and a big new factory in the South. The next year, Phelps Dodge Corporation, the copper mining giant, based in Phoenix, bought the family-owned Hudson International for $60 million.
"Within seven days of the sale, the Berlin wall came down," Mr. Akin said. "That really marked what I have come to call 'the outbreak of peace.' "
Diverse as Hudson's business is, nothing rivaled the defense industry in using top-quality and top-dollar wire, Mr. Akin said. The cuts in military spending left Hudson with more factories than it needed. The consolidation is expected to save the company $5 million annually, Mr. Akin said.
Hudson's cuts, in turn, have left its employees wondering where to look next.
Jim Gilbert, a mechanical engineer and shop steward of Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, plans to be the last worker out of the factory when it closes. He knows what he will do when it is all over.
"There's no crying over spilled milk," Mr. Gilbert said. "When it's over, I intend to sit down and write a nice long letter to Governor Cuomo and tell him exactly what I think."

HEADLINE: Despite Merger, Hospitals Get a Grim Prognosis

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Even as arbitragers were betting up the stocks of hospital companies last week after two giant chains, the Columbia Healthcare Corporation and HCA-Hospital Corporation of America, agreed to merge, industry executives and health economists were predicting a grim long-range outlook for both investor-owned and nonprofit hospitals.
"There will be a significant amount of hospital failures over the next 10 years," said Richard L. Scott, Columbia Healthcare's chairman. "Society is saying it wants to limit the amount of G.N.P. that we are going to spend on health care." 
 Growing pressure by Government and private insurers for lower prices is expected to squeeze hospital profits, or as the tax-exempt not-for-profit institutions call them, surpluses.
 
One-Stop Shopping
 Industry executives said the likely winners would be health-care systems that offered one-stop shopping: walk-in surgical centers, salaried or contract physicians, home health and nursing home care as well as hospital rooms.
Large buyers of health care, like insurance companies, have been building networks on an a la carte basis and say they would prefer to keep it that way. "We like to pick and choose," said a Houston-based executive of the Metlife managed care unit of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
The hospital chains, which operate 738 of the country's 5,300 general hospitals for short-term illnesses, are widely regarded as equal to the nonprofits in quality of care. But for all their bold talk about trimming costs, spending on overhead last year of 313 hospitals owned by the largest chains averaged 24 percent of pretax operating revenues. That was only about two percentage points less than at the average nonprofit hospital, said HCIA Inc., a health care research firm in Baltimore.
Some experts question the value of being a big national chain in local and regional markets. "It's a big country," said Dr. Michael A. Stocker, president of Cigna Healthcare, the largest for-profit health maintenance organization. "We make our alliances locally."
 
Making the Best of Hard Times
 Mr. Scott of Columbia Healthcare, not surprisingly, expects to make the best of the hard times. "Times are bad in retailing, too, but some people do well," he said. Columbia's stock close yesterday at $27.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, down 37.5 cents. Shares of HCA were unchanged on the Big Board at $27.75.
He said the merged company, which would have 190 hospitals in 26 states, England and Switzerland if Federal antitrust regulators and shareholders of the two companies approve the deal, would be able to get better discounts on the $1.7 billion it would spend annually for hospital supplies. It also could afford to buy better information systems and to pay top dollar for consultants to help arrange managed care deals.
Neither HCA nor Galen Healthcare, the large chain that merged with Columbia a few weeks ago, has been gaining market share. And analysts said two medium-sized hospital companies, American Medical Holdings and National Medical Enterprises, are also having trouble. National Medical Enterprises recently made a $125 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by insurance companies charging fraud and faces a number of similar suits.
The other large chain, Healthtrust Inc., has most of its hospitals in smaller cities where there is less competitive pressure.
 
Incentives for Doctors
 At a time when H.M.O.'s and other managed care contracts put a premium on keeping patients out of hospitals, said Jeff Goldsmith, a veteran Chicago-based hospital consultant, "the hospital chains' profitability continues to be harnessed to incentives that encourage physicians to do more and hospitalize patients more."
Although both Columbia and HCA have sought to give incentives to physicians to help cut costs by reducing services that may not be needed, Gail Warden, president of the Henry Ford Health System, a large hospital and H.M.O. based in Detroit, agreed with Mr. Goldsmith.
"In a managed care world, owning hospitals is not something I would recommend to investors," Mr. Warden said. Stephen M. Shortell, a professor of health services management at Northwestern University, observed that the for-profit chains had been generally slow to form the one-stop health care shopping networks that most hospitals would need to prosper.
Columbia Healthcare may be the exception. It said 30 percent of its business was already in outpatient care.
 
Offering All the Services
 Mr. Scott said he could offer "all the services in Houston" and would soon have all the pieces in place in El Paso, where Columbia is opening a rehabilitation hospital to complement its two hospitals, five outpatient centers and a nursing home. Columbia can also offer almost all services in Corpus Christi, Tex., Dade County, Fla, and Fort Meyers, Fla., he said.
While Wall Street analysts are leery of most hospital stocks, Columbia Healthcare has had generally good reviews. Kenneth S. Abramowitz at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company said the "positive side" of the Columbia-HCA merger was "Rick Scott's energy as a deal maker and his strategy that has worked in a handful of smaller markets."
As for the "negatives," Mr. Abramowitz said, "Mr. Scott has to rejuvenate two mature companies and successfully interject his strategy in 50 major markets."
 
Not a Growth Industry
 Larry Feinberg, president of Oracle Investors, a fund manager specializing in health care stocks, agreed that "hospitals are not going to be a huge growth industry for a while." He is betting that Columbia/HCA will thrive while the rest of the industry is shrinking.
But experts have deflated some of the early optimistic appraisals of the $5.7 billion merger. James D. Donovan Jr., a regional executive in Dallas for Kaiser Permanente, the country's largest H.M.O., was reserved about the prospects of dealing with the six HCA hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, although Kaiser has had a long and satisfactory relationship with Medical City Dallas Hospital, which Columbia acquired when it recently merged with Galen Healthcare.
George Pillari, chairman of HCIA Inc., the hospital research group, dismissed the projected immediate savings in the merger as relatively small for a company that would have $10 billion in combined revenues. The two companies said the merger would yield $130 million in savings over two years from joint purchasing, lower credit ratings and reduced overhead,
Carl Sherman, an analyst at Dillon, Read & Company, said: "They will have to build each market by buying not-for-profits," he said. "Then, can they actually deliver cost savings? No one has ever done that in this industry."

HEADLINE: Pact's New Hurdle: Hispanic Officials

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 9

 BODY:
As President Clinton tries to sell the North American Free Trade Agreement as a marriage between the United States and its Latin American neighbors, Hispanic lawmakers have become an unexpected obstacle.
The 17 Hispanic members of the House of Representatives have proven resistant to the Administration's argument that they should be natural allies, convinced that the trade accord with Mexico and Canada would create a huge common market helping Hispanic people on both sides of the border. 
 Instead, the Hispanic lawmakers are listening to constituents who are swayed less by feelings of Latin solidarity than by the same kinds of economic and regional concerns that affect everybody else: allegiances to unions, fears for jobs and proximity to the Mexican border.
Many are caught between conflicting loyalties to the White House, which is pushing strenuously for passage of the agreement; organized labor, which is opposed to the pact, and Democratic leaders, who have mixed thoughts and emotions about the accord's effects.
The recent experience of one representative, Luis V. Gutierrez, illustrates those conflicts. When Mr. Gutierrez organized a weekend town meeting in his predominantly Hispanic district here to announce his opposition to the trade agreement, the White House went on a blitz.
The United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, and Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros called Mr. Gutierrez on Friday to ask him to reconsider. And a meeting was set up for the Congressman to discuss details of the agreement with President Clinton at the White House.
Local Hispanic business owners, some of them enlisted by the Mexican Government, flooded Mr. Gutierrez's offices with calls.
But members of some local unions, taking the opposite point of view, jammed into the town meeting. Mexican-American union members held small plastic Mexican flags to emphasize that their opposition to the pact was simply a matter of jobs and not a reflection of hard feelings toward their homeland.
That is a lot of firepower directed at a freshman Congressman, especially one whose outspoken style has frequently isolated him from the mainstream of the House Democratic caucus. But the spirited effort to sway Mr. Gutierrez is indicative of the pains the Administration, the Mexican Government and other interest groups are taking to lobby the Congress's Hispanic members.
"We're in trouble if we split the Hispanic caucus evenly," said Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democratic chief deputy whip and the senior Mexican-American member of Congress to support the accord. "It's the symbolism on a Latin issue."
At the last minute, Mr. Gutierrezbacked off from announcing his intention to oppose the trade pact; he is still leaning strongly against it because he thinks it could cost Chicago jobs. Otherwise, the Administration's effort to win over the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is not going well. More than half of its 15 members are against or leaning against the accord. On Friday, Representative Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, announced his opposition to the agreement at a sweater factory in Perth Amboy before a group of Cuban-American, Puerto Rican and Dominican-American workers.
 
Snapping Up Lobbyists
 The reaction of the Hispanic caucus flies in the face of a concerted effort by Mexico City to win support for the agreement. The Mexican Government has hired virtually every Hispanic lobbyist in Washington to work for the accord, and they echo the Clinton Administration's pitch that the accord is a way to expand trade and ties with not only Mexico but all of Latin America.
Surveys indicate that Mexican-Americans living near the border hope the agreement will help stem the tide of illegal immigration, a problem that stirs anti-Hispanic feelings. But other Hispanics, particularly those who work in manufacturing industries and are unionized, are among the most ardent opponents of the trade accord. And in the Miami's Cuban-American community, opinions are running strongly against the treaty because of the Mexican Government's long-standing diplomatic ties to Fidel Castro.
"It shows tremendous maturity," Representative Menendez said of the diversity of opinion. "It shows we care about our Latin American brothers and sisters, but we also care about ourselves and about the country that adopted us."
Mr. Menendez had weighed his decision for months, and when he explained his thinking to 35 workers at the Genesis Knitting plant in Perth Amboy, he emphasized his economic concerns. "I want a Nafta that raises the standard of living in the United States and Mexico," he said, switching between Spanish and English. "But this Nafta doesn't do that. It keeps Mexican wages low by making sure Mexico does not need to enforce labor laws or collective bargaining."
 
Internecine Conflicts
 In a separate discussion with plant managers and union representatives, Mr. Menendez, who is of Cuban descent, gave a secondary reason for his opposition: "The Mexican Government is permitting Cuba to come into Mexico to set up front companies so Cuba can violate the commercial embargo and purchase goods from the United States in violation of U.S. law."
Hispanic politicians are worried that the trade debate could worsen divisions between Mexicans and other Hispanic people. As a freshman Puerto Rican representative in a district that is more than half Mexican-American, Mr. Gutierrez has to tread carefully or perhaps face a strong Mexican-American opponent in a primary next year, local Democrats note.
Mr. Gutierrez awoke at dawn to rework the statement he would read at the gathering. His concern: that he would disappoint his labor base by announcing that he had not yet made a decision. So in his speech, the Congressman made an impassioned plea for Hispanic unity and appealed to Mexican nationalism by calling on the United States to treat Mexico as an "equal partner."
"As currently written, this Nafta is bad trade policy," he said. But noting that President Clinton "has asked me to give him a chance," Mr. Gutierrez said he would work to find a compromise in which the accord would include strong enforcement procedures to increase wages for Mexican workers.
The audience of 220, many of them union members, appeared patient, and most people said they were certain Mr. Gutierrez would stand by them.
Still, Roberto de la Cruz, a local Mexican-American union leader, rose at one point and said: "We want you to know that even though we voted for you, we are keeping tabs. We want you to understand."
Mr. Gutierrez smiled and nodded. He understood.

HEADLINE: Israel Selling China Military Technology, C.I.A. Chief Asserts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Israel has sold advanced military technology to China for more than a decade and is moving to expand its cooperation with Beijing, says R. James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence.
The C.I.A. assessment was provided in written responses to questions by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee made the assessment public last week as part of a report on recent hearings it conducted on "proliferation threats of the 1990's," a committee aide said tonight. 
 There have been many news reports about the sale of Israeli military technology to China, which did not establish diplomatic relations with Israel until 1992, and the Rand Corporation has made similar assessments. The C.I.A.'s response to the committee was reported tonight by NBC News and confirmed by the aide.
 
Jets, Missiles, Tanks
 The C.I.A. says China has been acquiring advanced military technology from Israel for more than a decade on programs for jet fighters, air-to-air missiles and tanks. The agency said the sale of Israeli military technology to China "may be several billion dollars."
Despite the previous reports, the bluntness of the C.I.A. assessment surprised Congressional specialists and appears to reflect a growing concern among American intelligence experts that China is seeking to use Israel indirectly to obtain military technology that United States and other Western nations have refused to sell to Beijing.
The intelligence agency reports that despite worries in the West about China's military buildup and its export of missile systems and other weapons to Pakistan, Iran and other nations, Israel has continued to share military technology with the Chinese.
"Building on a long history of close defense industrial relations -- including work on China's next generation fighter, air-to-air missiles, and tank programs -- and the establishment of diplomatic relations in January 1992, China and Israel appear to be moving toward formalizing and broadening their military technical cooperation," Mr. Woolsey said.
Explaining its assessment, the agency noted that Beijing and Tel Aviv recently signed an agreement to cooperate in sharing technology in a number of areas, including electronics and space. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel was visiting Beijing today to discuss the broadening of Israeli-Chinese ties.
In addition, an increasing number of Israeli military firms also have opened offices in China to sell their products.
"Beijing probably hopes to tap Israeli expertise for cooperative development of military technologies, such as advanced tank power plants and airborne radar systems, that the Chinese would have difficulty producing on their own," the agency said.
 
Likely Pressure From Congress
 The agency's assessment is likely to provoke calls by members of Congress for greater scrutiny of the sale of American military technology to Israel. While there is strong support in the Congress for providing Israel with the money and technology to keep its armed forces strong, there has long been worry that Israel might resell some of the technology to other nations.
Ruth Yaron, spokeswoman at the Israeli Embassy, said tonight that she had not seen Mr. Woolsey's statement and could not immediately comment on it.
The four-paragraph C.I.A. statement to the committee did not say the Israelis had been re-exporting American technology, but that has been a concern for United States officials. The assessment also comes a week after China angered the United States by conducting an underground nuclear test.
 
Verification of End-Use
 An August report by the General Accounting Office, for example, asserted that the United States had not adequately supervised the sale of American technology to Israel for its program to develop the Arrow anti-missile interceptor. As a result, the G.A.O. asserted, there was a risk that some of the technology might be diverted to other nations.
"No checks were performed to verify the end-use and destination of U.S.- provided items and technologies," said the report by the G.A.O., which is the investigative arm of Congress.
At the same time, some American concerns about the sharing of technology to Israel have not turned out to be well founded. In the Bush Administration, the United States accused Israel of sharing American-made Patriot missile technology with China in violation of United States-Israeli agreements banning such diversion.
Israel denied the allegation. After an American team visited Israel to look into the charge, the State Department said its investigators had found "no evidence that Israel had transferred a Patriot missile or Patriot missile technology" to China.
Israel is not the only nation that is selling military technology to China. In recent years, Russia has sold advanced fighters, missiles and military technology to China.

HEADLINE: Mubarak Promising Democracy, and Law and Order

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 11

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak said today that his Government had Islamic militants on the run and that it was moving toward democracy. The President's opponents have charged that the Government had stymied political reform.
"Most of them are criminals," Mr. Mubarak said of the Islamic militants. "They are being directed from outside the country. Most of them have committed about 15 crimes and given 5, 10 or 15 years in jail, but escaped. Now we are collecting them. That is why everything has gone down." 
 For 20 months, the Mubarak administration has been locked in a bloody battle with Islamic militants that has left an estimated 200 dead. The nation's tourism industry, which once brought in $2.2 billion a year, has been crippled by attacks against foreign tourists.
 
See Shift in Popular Wind
 But in a two-hour interview at the Presidential Palace, Mr. Mubarak said the public had turned sharply against those trying to transform Egypt into an Islamic state through violence.
The 65-year-old former Air Force commander, who took power after the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981, said the militants had selected him for assassination, but he made light of the threat.
"So they attack the President," he said, chuckling. "Another President will just collect them and put them in jail, all of them. They will meet a very tough time. I am the man who is giving them freedom. I am very flexible."
The Government has arrested hundreds, perhaps thousands of suspected militants, and has sentenced 27 to death; 15 were hanged in June and July.
Mr. Mubarak said he knew that the United States, which he will visit later this month, will begin to cut its aid to Egypt from the current $2.3 billion a year, but he cautioned that any reduction should be gradual.
"Keeping Egypt stable is in the interest of the United States," he said. "If you don't realize this, and if you sharply reduce aid, you will be committing a mistake."
Some United States officials have expressed displeasure with the harsh tactics against militants and the failure to institute direct elections.
"The public opinion should be ed-u-ca-ted," Mr. Mubarak said, tapping out each syllable with his finger on the table. "This country was under pressure for years and years, so when you open the gate for freedom, you will find many terrible things taking place.
"If you have a dam and keep the water until it begins to overflow, and then you open the gates, it will drown many people. We have to give a gradual dose so people can swallow it and understand it. The Egyptians are not Americans."
The President denied that an opposition political leader and two journalists detained for three days and released on Saturday had been held, as they asserted, for "humiliating the President."
"They are supporting terrorism," he said of the leader of the Socialist Labor Party, the only legal party with links to Islamic fundamentalists, and the reporters. He attacked the reporters for inciting violence in articles in the opposition weekly Ash Shaab.
He dismissed the call by Ash Shaab for a public disclosure of any arms deals made by the President, and vigorously denied such involvement. "If you give me 10 million or 50 million pounds," he said, referring to the Egyptian currency, "what am I going to do with it? Cars? I have lots of cars, all presents. A house? I am living in a good house. Food? I am eating, and less than any man in the street, less than anybody."
 
Rabin, Arafat, Fahd, Hussein
 Among other points made by Mr. Mubarak were these:
*He praised Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who signed the Gaza-Jericho accord with Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. "You can give and take with him," Mr. Mubarak said of Mr. Rabin. "You can discuss with him." But Mr. Mubarak said he probably would not visit Israel in the near future; his aides say a visit to Israel could give ammunition to the militants in their propaganda war.
*He said he would meet within days with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to discuss financial support for Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. His aides also said he would seek a reconciliation between King Fahd and King Hussein of Jordan. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia suspended $500 million in annual aid to Jordan because of King Hussein's support for Iraq during the gulf war.
*He said he expected concessions soon from the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in an effort to avoid a tightening of sanctions that were imposed when Libya failed to turn over two suspects in the bombing of the Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland. But the President refused to spell out what the Libyan steps might be.
The President also said he would not seek re-election when his term ends in six years. He said that he had wavered about running again in the referendum on Oct. 4, but that he had finally decided to accept one last term for two reasons: a fear that "chaos" could envelop the 58 million Egyptians if he stepped down, and a desire to push Egypt toward a market economy.
The referendum, in which the President took 96.3 percent of the vote, allowed a yes or no vote for the President. There were no other candidates.
"Until we have stability and economic reforms, this is the best way to run the country," he said.
But Mr. Mubarak said he and his family were tired of life at the helm of the most populous Arab country.
"I am limited," he said. "One of my sons is staying in London, and we are trying to persuade him to come home. 'But Father,' he tells me, 'I have no freedom here.' "

HEADLINE: U.S. and U.N. Tell Haiti Military Must Cooperate

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Acting on a request by the United States, the Security Council warned Haitian military leaders today that Haiti could face renewed economic sanctions for failing to allow a ship carrying United States and Canadian troops to dock.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher also said that the landing of the 200 troops, part of an international contingent to oversee the return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, would be delayed until the Haitian military could guarantee the troops' safety. 
 "We believe the current situation does not justify docking the ship at this time," Mr. Christopher said.
 
Request for a Ruling
 Shortly after Mr. Christopher's statement, the Security Council asked Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to determine if the blocking of the ship and harassment of diplomats violated the agreement on Father Aristide's return.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali is expected to report in a few days, Administration officials said. If he finds that Haitian military leaders have breached the accord, the Security Council may reimpose the sanctions, including an oil embargo.
Administration officials said the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, Dante Caputo, and the United States charge d'affaires in Port-au-Prince, Vicki Huddleston, are to meet with Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras to insist that the peace accord he signed be honored. Representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency are to meet with Michel Francois, the chief of police in Port-au-Prince, to convey the same message.
 
Quarrel Over a Berth
 Part of the agreement calls for the dispatch about 1,600 foreign personnel, roughly divided between military and police forces, which includes about 600 Americans. Administration officials said they had already received clearance from Haitian military leaders for the ship, the Harlan County, to dock in Port-au-Prince, and that the appearance of another ship at the assigned berth may have violated the peace accords.
"The berthing arrangements were not in place when the ship arrived," said a senior State Department official, adding that the Administration considered that a "breach of the commitment made by the military and political authorities to allow trainers into the country."
Officials said they were not surprised by today's events, seeing the dispute as a test of international resolve.
 
Nervousness in Congress
 Congress is becoming increasingly jittery over the prospect of United States soldiers being dispatched to a volatile country, and Pentagon officials remain wary of the mission in Haiti.
The Pentagon and the State Department have split over sending the troops, and last week the Defense Department delayed the sailing of the Harlan County until it received clarification of the mission.
Eight days after an airborne assault in Mogadishu, Somalia, against the forces of Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid left at least 15 United States soldiers dead, lawmakers say the Administration is again placing troops in danger without having briefed Congress.
"We're very wary about United States troops going into places of danger," Representative Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said today. "I don't think the Haitian effort has been widely explained on the Hill; at least in my case it has not been."
 
The Troops' Mission
 The Administration has agreed to provide 600 military engineers and logistics personnel to aid in reconstruction in Haiti and to train the military after Father Aristide returns to power. Under the peace accord, the President is to be in Port-au-Prince by the end of the month, more than two years after he was deposed.
The Harlan County is ferrying 175 American and 25 Canadian military engineers to Haiti. The total force of 1,600 is to monitor the Haitian military and the police and providing training; it is not to perform combat or police functions.
Officials say, for example, that the lead elements of the international police force, which includes 50 Royal Canadian Mounted Police already in Haiti, will not seek to secure the port area so the Harlan County can land its troops. Instead, the ship will remain offshore until the Haitian military provides an open berth and guarantees that the soldiers will not be harassed.
Officials said that after landing its troops, the Harlan County would remain offshore, ready to take part in a rescue if necessary.
State Department officials have stressed for some time that while gunmen have often intimidated Haitians, they have not threatened diplomats or human rights monitors in Haiti. Thus today's threats against Vicki Huddleston, the charge d'affaires, represents an ominous development, they said.

HEADLINE: In a Quiet Session, Dow Rises 8.67 Points

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
The stock market was generally listless yesterday in a quiet Columbus Day session.
Few significant trends were apparent, analysts said, with banks and some bond markets closed and other markets ending trading early. 
 Much of the trading was related to the employment statistics released on Friday, which many analysts viewed as evidence of an underperforming economy.
"There was also some trepidation concerning the third-quarter earnings announcements that are going to be coming out in the next few weeks," said Edwin Walczak, chief investment officer of Vontobel U.S.A. "It's not exactly robust out there."
 
Market Indicators Advance
 Still, all three major market indicators advanced. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 8.67 points, to 3,593.41; the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was up 0.57 point, to 460.88, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 3.38 points, to a record high of 767.65.
These gains occurred, however, on extremely low volume. On the New York Stock Exchange, 183.2 million shares changed hands, compared with 243.6 million shares Friday. Advancing issues narrowly exceeded declines, 1,029 to 943.
The American Stock Exchange market value index set another record yesterday. It closed at 467.59, up 2.89 points.
Cyclical issues sensitive to the economy continued to erode. Among them were International Paper, which dropped 1/2, to 58 5/8; Bethlehem Steel, off 1/2, to 14 1/8, and Reynolds Metals, off 7/8, to 41 7/8.
Weakness also occurred among some retailers. Dayton Hudson fell 2 1/8, to 65, while Kmart declined 1/2, to 23 3/4.
 
Semiconductor Stocks Fall
 In addition, Intel slumped 4 3/4, to 65 1/2, despite reporting strong earnings, setting a negative tone for the semiconductor sector. National Semiconductor dropped 1 1/8, to 18, and Advanced Micro Devices fell 3/8, to 20 1/8.
On the other hand, some groups benefited from strength not only in the New York markets, but also overseas.
"There was some gravitation back to the safe areas of the market, those showing dependable earnings growth," Mr. Walczak said. "Some of these stocks have been oversold."
One such area was drugs and pharmaceuticals, which moved into higher ground despite the Clinton Administration's proposed health care plan. Pfizer increased 1 to 60 3/8; Warner-Lambert climbed 2 1/4, to 68 1/4, and Johnson & Johnson rose 1/2, to 39 7/8. Other gains were notched by Amgen, up 1 1/4, to 41, and Medtronic, up 1 7/8, to 70 3/4.
Another strong group was consumer nondurables. They included Philip Morris, the most active stock on the Big Board, which rose 7/8, to 49 1/8; Anheuser-Busch, up 3/8, to 46 5/8; Pepsico, up 5/8, to 39 5/8, and Coca-Cola, up 3/4, to 42.
 
Rebound by Nike
 Some issues that had been weak earlier rebounded yesterday into the plus side. Nike advanced 1 1/4, to 46 1/4, and Vons rose 1, to 18. Eastman Kodak also increased 1 1/2, to 59 1/4.
But Tyco Toys -- which said that third-quarter earnings would be sharply lower than the period a year earlier and projected a loss for the year -- declined 1 1/8, to 11 3/4. U.S. Healthcare tumbled 3 1/4, to 43 7/8, after Goldman, Sachs removed the company from its recommended list. And Score Board dropped 1, to 30, following an accusation by New York City that the trading-card company had violated its consumer protection laws.

HEADLINE: Greek Victor Now Facing Tough Task

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATHENS, Oct. 11

 BODY:
With Andreas Papandreou back in power in Greece, borne by a remarkable political resurrection, the question is whether the Socialist leader, onetime firebrand and perennial master of surprise will go back to his old quixotic ways.
Mr. Papandreou's Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement has emerged with a solid majority of 170 seats in the 300-member Parliament after Sunday's national election. 
 His victory over Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis has thrust Mr. Papandreou, a Harvard-educated economist and onetime United States citizen, into a changed world where his cold war stock-in-trade no longer has currency. And despite result of the election, the campaign left more questions than answers.
First of all, there is the issue of his health, which has not been good since open-heart surgery in 1988.
 
European Community Post
 "If the question is whether he can run a hands-on, day-to-day Government, the answer is probably not," said a diplomat. The 74-year-old Greek leader's frailty is doubly important because in January, Greece assumes the rotating, six-month presidency of the European Community, which entails a potentially grueling travel schedule that Mr. Papandreou may be loath to undertake.
Similarly, his health may well constrain him from a more flamboyant foreign policy, as he concentrates on the more pressing problem of economic policy at home that forms the biggest question mark.
As he acknowledged victory last night, Mr. Papandreou spoke of "difficult problems" inherited from Mr. Mitsotakis and promised "economic policies that will bring stability, development and social security."
 
Inherited Austerity Plan
 What Mr. Papandreou has inherited from Mr. Mitsotakis, though, is not so much a problem as an unpalatable solution to Greece's chronic economic woes: an austerity program that was intended to curb inflation, cut huge state deficits and begin selling off chunks of Greece's vast state sector to private business -- in essence, a reversal of everything Mr. Papandreou stood for in the 1980's.
His last spell as Prime Minister, from 1981 to 1989, ended in scandal, corruption charges and accusations of mismanagement that left him isolated and discredited among the swing voters who decide Greek elections. His successful quest for vindication will have a price, however.
As his supporters careened through Athens into the small hours today with car horns blaring and banners flapping from motorcycles and car windows, the message they were sending Mr. Papandreou was one of anticipation: now that Mr. Mitsotakis is gone, they were saying, let's get back to the good old days when the money ran freely from the state coffers.
 
Pressure From Public Workers
 "He has an obligation to his voters who want him to reverse privatization and the hold-down on public spending," said Sotirios Papasotiriou, an economist. "He has to give something." Specifically, Mr. Papandreou is under pressure to increase wages for the 670,000 Government employees who, along with their families, make up a large chunk of his constituency.
At the same time, though, Mr. Papandreou needs economic growth and European support. Greece is the poorest nation in the community, and its signature on the Maastricht Treaty on European integration obliges it to keep pace with its partners.
"Greece is so dependent on the European Community, that I don't think Papandreou will be able to do anything like he did in the past," said Mr. Papasotiriou.
The conservative New Democracy party of Mr. Mitsotakis, with its 111 seats, was humbled by defections and the huge personal unpopularity that accrued to its leader after three years of biting economic austerity.
As he conceded defeat last night, Mr. Mitsotakis, also 74, said he would begin the process of holding elections for a new party leader, possibly a younger man like Miltiades Evert, former Mayor of Athens, to stanch the hemorrhage of voters towards Antonis Samaras, a 42-year-old maverick who broke with Mr. Mitsotakis and set up his own party, Political Spring.
With barely a majority at Mr. Mitsotakis's command, the revolt stripped New Democracy of its parliamentary edge, forced elections seven months ahead of schedule and split the one-time monolith of the Greek right.
By today, Mr. Samaras's party had won 4.6 per cent of the vote and 10 parliamentary seats, all of them taken from New Democracy.

HEADLINE: Hotel Sale May Signal End of Japan's Patience

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 11

 BODY:
At the peak of Japan's property-buying binge a few years ago, the little-known Azabu Building Company paid outrageous prices for real estate around the globe. Now, in a potent symbol of the severity of the financial hangover afflicting Japan's property and banking industries, Azabu's main lender has said it will auction one of the company's plum properties on Hawaii and accept what will likely be a huge loss.
The Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, which poured billions of dollars into ill-conceived property loans during the 1980's, said it had filed legal papers in preparation for the auction of the Waikiki Hyatt Regency. The bank seized the hotel after Azabu was unable to maintain its payments on a crushing debt burden said to total about $7.15 billion, a third of which is reportedly owed to Mitsui Trust. 
 Azabu had contended last year that the hotel was worth $660 million, but property experts here expect it to fetch a fraction of that.
Yoshiaki Koshimura, a spokesman for the ailing bank, said no date had been set for the auction, but he hinted that more might be coming by pointing out that the bank had seized control of several other hotels on Hawaii that Azabu Building purchased, including the Maui Marriott.
"This is not the end of Azabu's problems by any means," said Alicia Ogawa, an analyst here with Salomon Brothers. "Mitsui Trust also still has some pretty horrifying problems to deal with."
The auction is resulting from a surprisingly public feud between Mitsui Trust and Azabu's flamboyant chief, Kitaro Watanabe. Mr. Watanabe once tried to greenmail an auto parts concern, the Koito Manufacturing Company, by purchasing a large block of its stock and then demanding the company buy him out at an exorbitant sum.
When he was spurned, he recruited T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oil and gas man and self-proclaimed friendly investor, in an attempt to put additional pressure on Koito. That failed, but it did offer the spectacle of Mr. Pickens being shouted down by Japanese gangsters at Koito's annual meeting in 1990 as he sought to demand that his rights as a shareholder be respected.
The proposed sale of the Hawaiian hotel is also a belated acknowledgment that both the Japanese banks and the speculators who fed the real estate boom during the 1980's are going to have to face up to what will likely be billions of dollars in losses.
Japan's banks had steadfastly stood by the property investors, restructuring their loans and in many instances reducing the interest rates to zero in a desperate effort to wait out the plunge in land prices here and abroad.
The hope was that with patience, the banks would be able to avoid unpleasant write-offs. The significance of Mitsui Trust's announcement is that it shows the pain has simply grown too great. Japanese property prices show no sign of rebounding after losing more than 50 percent of their value over the last four years. There is little prospect of recovering much of the money spent overseas because in many instances the Japanese investors overpaid. The burden on banks from bad property loans has become a significant drag on the Japanese economy.
Azabu Building was the creation of the 59-year-old Mr. Watanabe, who rose from obscurity to run a profitable auto dealership. He parlayed that business into a thriving real estate empire during the 1980's, riding the crest of one of the most excessive speculative binges in history.
Fueled by a flood of bank loans, Mr. Watanabe and a number of other entrepreneurs put together multibillion-dollar portfolios of properties in Japan, Europe and the United States. The Japanese properties ranged from the Tiffany Building and the new Regent Hotel in Manhattan to the Pebble Beach Golf Club in California and more than half of the luxury hotel rooms on Hawaii.
Finally, soaring interest rates in Japan in 1990, a plunging stock market and a slide in real estate prices took their toll. Azabu halted interest payments on its debt in 1991, and early last year Mitsui Trust discreetly sent over seven executives to operate the company.
The cooperation ended with a startling board room ambush last March, when Mr. Watanabe used his control of the company's shares to oust the Mitsui Trust officials.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Little Changed In Subdued Holiday Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar showed little change against other most other leading currencies yesterday. Trading was subdued because Tokyo banks were closed for a Japanese holiday, while banks in New York and elsewhere in the United States were closed for the Columbus Day holiday. Volume was light in Europe as well.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.22 Japanese yen, up slightly from 106.10 yen on Friday. It also rose to 1.6042 German marks, from 1.6035 marks. 
 Gold prices edged higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, rose 20 cents, to $361.70 an ounce.
In European trading, currency traders focused on a long-awaited decision by the Germany Federal Constitutional Court on legal objections to the Maastricht Treaty, which details conditions for further European unification. Fears that the court may not accept the treaty unconditionally brought buying of mark assets.
Uncertainty regarding Europe's direction typically favors the mark, which is seen as the community's strongest currency.
"Even if they approve the treaty, there must be a risk that they add some sort of codicils," said Peter Lucton, economic adviser at Barclays Global Foreign Exchange in London. "That leaves Maastricht in a state of limbo."
 
 
European Volume Thin
 Volume thinned to a trickle after European foreign exchange desks closed shop for the day. With many American banks closed and others modestly staffed, interbank dealing was thin and most customers sidelined, dealers said.
News of an earthquake off the coast of Japan failed to shake the yen out of its narrow range, and dealers said they would await damage assessments before making a move.
"The assumption is that the yen would first drop if a disaster occurs, then it would surge on capital repatriation," said Lawrence Weinman, vice president at the Bank of America. The United States National Earthquake Information Center later said the tremor should pose no danger because its epicenter was far out at sea.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Mitchell Listens to Wife And Earns Starting Job

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY

 BODY:
Scott Mitchell spent Saturday night in Cleveland Clinic with viral conjunctivitis, an infection of his left eye. He telephoned his wife, Kim, and said he did not think he could play the next day.
"She told me I had to play," Mitchell said. "She said somehow I would get my first chance, and I had to be ready when it came." 
 How prophetic. Mitchell did play for the Miami Dolphins against the Browns, and not just to hold for field goals and conversions. When Dan Marino was knocked out of the game in the second quarter, Mitchell took over. Now he is the starting quarterback.
Coach Don Shula of the Dolphins said yesterday that magnetic-resonance-imaging tests showed that Marino's right Achilles' tendon was ruptured, meaning he would not play again this season. Marino underwent surgery yesterday and will need four to six months to rehabilitate. According to Shula, the doctors said Marino should recover completely.
Mitchell, 25 years old, is the only other quarterback on the Dolphins' 53-man roster. Had Mitchell been injured Sunday, the Dolphins' emergency quarterback would have been Tony Martin, a wide receiver who played quarterback at Mesa College, in Colorado.
The Dolphins have quarterback Doug Pederson on the practice squad, and Shula said he would be activated. He said the Dolphins would also look for a veteran backup. Although he did not name candidates, two possibilities are Mark Vlasic and Tom Tupa, both unemployed. The Dolphins might also look for a quarterback on another team's practice squad, such as Shane Matthews of the Chicago Bears.
No matter who they get, their hopes this season now rest with William Scott Mitchell. At Utah, he passed for 8,981 yards, placing him 12th in career yardage among major college passers. As a pro, he fell into obscurity.
 
Fourth-Round Pick
 Mitchell was drafted in the fourth round in 1990 and spent his rookie season on the inactive list. He threw no passes in 1991 and only eight in 1992, but before the 1992 season he was the starting quarterback for the Orlando Thunder of the springtime World League of American Football. He is 6 feet 6 inches, 230 pounds and left-handed.
"We've got great confidence in him," Shula said, "and we wouldn't really change things that much with him. We build a game plan and expect Scott or Dan to work within that plan the same way."
On his first play against the Browns, Mitchell's pass was intercepted and returned 97 yards for a touchdown. He later threw for two Dolphins' touchdowns for a 24-14 victory. He did not seem awed by his new responsibilities.
"I've been here four years and feel at home with our offense," he said. "I have the ability to do what's asked of me. Only time will tell how differently I play than Dan Marino."
The game cost the Dolphins more than Marino. Middle linebacker John Offerdahl, the key to their defense, suffered a dislocated right shoulder and will miss three or four weeks.
 
Wounded Quarterback No. 2
 Drew Bledsoe, the New England Patriots' rookie quarterback, has a sprained left knee, but how much time he will miss is uncertain. Bledsoe underwent tests yesterday to determine how much damage he suffered in a 23-21 victory over the Phoenix Cardinals, the Patriots' first triumph under Coach Bill Parcells.
"He probably won't play this week," Parcells said, "but I don't know. They didn't tell me not to play him yesterday. I'm the one who took him out. I watched him drop back, and it looked like he was going to struggle, and I didn't want to expose him any further."
Bledsoe's replacement would be Scott Secules. Like Mitchell with the Dolphins, Secules relieved Sunday and led his team to victory.
 
 
Wounded Offenses
 The Minnesota Vikings, somehow tied for their division lead with a 3-2 record, have scored five touchdowns in five games. In Sunday's 15-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Vikings totaled only 268 yards and gave up five sacks. "I am not a whiner or crybaby," Coach Dennis Green of the Vikings said, "so don't get into me with a lot of questions about what's wrong."
The San Diego Chargers, after Sunday's 16-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, dropped to 2-3 and last place in their division. This was their third game this season without an offensive touchdown. Against a virtual eight-man front, they rushed 20 times for 19 yards. "They were waiting every play, every down," said Chargers' tailback Marion Butts. Coach Bobby Ross's assessment: "We were very, very poor."
 
Older Is Better or Wiser
 On relieving Jeff Hostetler and rallying the Raiders to a 24-20 victory Sunday over the Jets, 38-year-old Vince Evans said: "I believe my latter days have been greater than my former days. A degree of maturity sets in. I'm not rattled by things."
On deciding, after 31 years as a National Football League head coach, whether to retire when his contract expires after the 1994 season, 63-year-old Don Shula said: "When it's time to make the decision. I'll sit back and take my time and decide. But I will tell you, I still enjoy coaching very much."

HEADLINE: U.S. Prepares to Unveil Blueprint for Reducing Heat-Trapping Gases

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
THE Clinton Administration is about to announce its plan for reducing the United States' emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, in accordance with the treaty it signed at last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. And though the plan is still being discussed and officials are closely guarding the details, it appears likely to rely more on carrots than on sticks in seeking to get industry to comply.
If Government officials, environmentalists and industry representatives who have been involved in creating the plan over the last six months are right, it will contain no new energy taxes, will hold regulation to a minimum and will emphasize and encourage voluntary efforts to use energy more efficiently. The goal is to reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000 in an effort to avert a possible global warming. The announcement of the plan is expected within the next two weeks. 
 Energy efficiency is central to controlling emissions because carbon dioxide, the most important heat-trapping gas, is produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, the energy foundations of the modern economy. Some scientists believe a continuing atmospheric buildup of the gases could cause a serious and even catastrophic warming of the earth's climate in the next century.
 
Timetable for Action
 In some ways the Administration's approach is similar to that of the Bush Administration, but with at least two big differences: President Clinton, unlike President George Bush, has committed the nation to a specific target and timetable for reducing emissions. And the Clinton Administration, unlike its predecessor, appears ready to enter the fray as an active participant with industry in trying to speed and expand the adoption of energy-efficient technologies.
"There are technologies on the shelf now that are sorely underdemployed," said Katie McGinty, the director of the White House Office of Environmental Policy, which is developing the plan. She said the Administration hoped to accelerate the use of those technologies. One likely provision calls for the Government to spend about $200 million a year to stimulate the adoption of such technologies. The Government would also act as a clearinghouse and expediter.
Among the measures that could be encouraged in this way, for example, is an expansion of the Environmental Protection Agency's "green lights" program, in which the Federal Government provides technical assistance to companies and local governments that agree to install more efficient lighting systems. Energy savings pay for the installation. The plan is said to contain a broad range of such energy-saving measures.
This general approach would be another example of a developing Administration strategy aimed at encouraging public-private collaboration on a variety of economic, technological and environmental issues. An earlier example was the announcement last month that the Government and the automobile companies were collaborating on the development of an auto three times as energy-efficient as today's cars.
 
Reversal of Bush Position
 Last April, President Clinton reversed the Bush Administration policy and committed the United States to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. At that time, Mr. Clinton instructed his subordinates to come up with a plan that reduced emissions not through more regulation but rather by relying on "American ingenuity and creativity" in producing energy-efficient technology.
"I think this plan will achieve both of the President's objectives," Ms. McGinty said. She said that while the plan would include "every kind of approach going," the idea of voluntary partnerships would be "a significant part" of the package.
But can a voluntary plan work?
"They're going to give it the good college try," said William A. Nitze, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a Washington-based nonprofit coalition of leaders in government, industry, environmentalism and the consumer movement dedicated to promoting investment in energy efficiency. Mr. Nitze said both he and the Administration were "pretty bullish about the outcome of such a strategy."
Industry, as might be expected, has supported the general principle. Environmentalists give it mixed reviews, with some faulting it as not having enough of a "hammer" and others approving the general idea. All sides are wary of details yet to come.
The plan will not rely solely on industry's good intentions, Ms. McGinty said, but will include features that give "backbone" to the partnership strategy. She did not specify the features.
Some Government officials have acknowledged that there is much uncertainty in the voluntary approach, since it relies on corporate and individual behavior, which is difficult to predict. Because of this uncertainty, the Administration intends to monitor the plan's performance carefully; if it appears not to be working, Ms. McGinty said, further measures will be considered.
 
Close Scrutiny Expected
 There is a substantial foreign-policy incentive for paying close attention and adjusting: the international community will soon be watching the United States, as it will all countries, to determine how well it is meeting its commitments to control heat-trapping gases under the Rio treaty. The Clinton plan stands to be scrutinized closely and critically by other signers of the treaty who are looking to Washington for leadership, not only on this issue but on environmental issues generally.
It is widely anticipated that the treaty will be ratified by the requisite 50 countries by the end of this year (when the Senate approved the treaty in August 1992, the United States became one of the earliest ratifiers). The treaty would go into force 90 days after the 50th ratification. If that happens next spring, the scrutiny would probably come a year later.
While the signers would eventually be required to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at safe levels, the treaty calls only vaguely, as a first step, for countries to aim at returning greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The Bush Administration, which feared the economic price of meeting a firm target, refused to accept a specific target and timetable and successfully pressured other countries to go along. In adopting the timetable, the Clinton Administration has taken a first step that goes beyond what is required by the treaty.
In addition to encouraging the expansion of off-the-shelf energy-saving technologies that might show results by 2000, the Clinton plan is also expected to include provisions through which the Government would help industries speed the adoption, over the long term, of alternative energy technologies now on the cusp of economic practicality. These include, for example, photovoltaic electric cells and advanced wind turbines.
A disputed provision that is likely to be included in the plan would encourage owners of timberlands to leave trees in place rather than cut them down. Trees and other photosynthesizing plants are "sinks" that absorb carbon dioxide.
Environmentalists look askance at this measure because they believe it would send the wrong signal to other countries. "It tells the Europeans you don't have to deal with your emissions from energy production, that you can offset that by measures on the sink side," said Alden Meyer, director of the program on climate change and energy of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which focuses on energy and environmental issues. In addition, they say, there is no guarantee the trees will not eventually be cut or burned.
The Clinton plan is not expected to include any provisions for regulating energy use in transportation -- for example, stronger gas-mileage requirements for automobiles. Provisions like that presumably could be brought into play later if the initial proposals do not work.
The question of whether and how greenhouse emissions are to be reduced further after the year 2000, a concern of many environmentalists, is expected to be discussed but not resolved in the plan. A panel of scientists advising the United Nations and parties to the climate treaty has said that stabilizing the overall atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide at today's levels would require a worldwide 60 percent cut in the 1990 level of emissions.
 
Numbers Are Questioned
 Some environmentalists, like Dan Becker, of the Sierra Club, question the emissions estimates on which the plan is to be based. "The numbers are very squishy," he said. But Ms. McGinty said the plan "has really been put through the wringer any number of ways; the numbers are really solid."
Dan Lashof, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he thought the general approach of "putting together a package of individual initiatives tied together by a commitment to keep track of how those are doing," plus the assurance that stronger measures could be applied if necessary, "is fine."
But he expressed concern about "what the specifics are, what's in and what's out in terms of actual measures to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, and to what extent the plan may anticipate using credits from the forestry sector to offset growth in the fossil-fuel sector."
Mr. Meyer's reaction was similarly equivocal. "I think the bottom line is mixed," he said. "There are going to be some individual measures we're going to applaud." But he said the plan, at least from what now appeared to be known, placed too much emphasis on voluntary measures, "with no prospect of hammers or sticks to bring us into compliance if those don't work."

HEADLINE: The Prodigal Returns in Greece

 BODY:
Few politicians have had more lives than Andreas Papandreou, the once and future Prime Minister of Greece. Europeans remember his previous term from 1981 to 1989, when his free spending dismayed central bankers and brought Greece close to insolvency. Americans remember him as a former U.S. citizen and an academic economist who later baited Washington. Yet confounding odds, age, ill health and charges of corruption, Mr. Papandreou trounced his conservative rival, Constantine Mitsotakis, in Sunday's election.
His comeback owed much to his opponent's austerity measures and to a split in the ruling New Democracy Party. Even so, Mr. Papandreou's victory is a remarkable personal feat -- especially since eight million voters were aware that their huge national debt was the legacy of his profligate brand of Socialism. 
 Whatever his return augurs for Greece, its wider repercussions are scarcely comforting. The dissolution of Yugoslavia has rekindled Greek fears that Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic, has territorial designs on the Greek province of Macedonia. As leader of the opposition, Mr. Papandreou helped generate the nationalist passions that propelled Prime Minister Mitsotakis to press for the isolation of a weak and struggling neighbor.
Optimists can always hope that, once in office, Mr. Papandreou will prove less intransigent than his record suggests. As a member of NATO and the European Community, Greece has more to fear from Balkan turbulence than from Macedonia. And however tempted he may be to run up huge deficits again, Mr. Papandreou is constrained by an empty cupboard and the Community's monetary policies.
Still, for Mr. Papandreou to turn elder statesman would be yet another unexpected metamorphosis -- possible but not likely. For the Clinton Administration, the change in Greece more probably signifies a new source of friction in the Balkans.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
An Independent Attack Against Florio

BYLINE: By Jon Nordheimer

 BODY:

Client: Hands Across New Jersey
 
Creator: Larry Weitzner, Jamestown Associates, South Orange
 
Visual: Jim Florio, smiling and looking confident, is seen in a television film clip waving to a friendly group of onlookers. The scene quickly shifts to a padlocked factory gate over the heading "325,000 Lost Jobs." The next graphic reads "71,000 Lost Homes" accompanied by a picture of what appears to be a homeless person sitting on the ground beneath a tree. A framed picture of the Governor remains on the screen as headlines from The Trentonian pop up alongside: "America's Worst Governor," "Think Tanks Give Florio an F," "2.8 Billion Tax Increase" and "Florio to Taxpayers: 'Drop Dead'." The television clip of Mr. Florio seen at the beginning is repeated followed by the anti-tax group's phone number "Call 1-800-VETO JIM." 

Text: Mr. Florio is heard in the television film clip saying "It's a good day to be Governor." (Narrator) Not for the 325,000 people who lost their jobs since you became Governor. Not for the families who have lost their homes. Not since you raised taxes $2.8 billion and won't rule out another massive tax increase. Hands Across New Jersey wants to stop Jim Florio before he destroys our economy for good. To support our effort call 1-800-VETO JIM. (Mr. Florio once again is shown waving and saying "It's a good day to be Governor." (Narrator) Not for long, Jim.
 
Analysis: Packaging the perfect screen image in a political attack ad is delicate work where the subliminal can work against, neutralize or even overwhelm the main business of whacking a target with heavy blunt instruments. The tricky element here is the decision to open and close the spot with a television clip of an attractive, almost warm Jim Florio surrounded by what appears to be a receptive crowd. You can search all day for a friendlier visual image of the Governor, who is to warmth what Madonna is to inhibition, and not find it, even in Democratic ads. Check last week's gubernatorial debate: Mr. Florio did not, could not, crack a smile in 60 minutes. Here the producers obviously thought promoting the benign image was worth the darker message: This guy is enjoying himself while the people of New Jersey suffer. The rest is boilerplate seen earlier in television spots of Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate, with whom the tax protest group is closely aligned. A Whitman ad now on the air seeks to blame Mr. Florio's tax policy for the recession, saying the state lost 280,000 jobs since he became Governor in 1990. This Hands Across New Jersey ad bumps the figure to 325,000 and throws in 8,000 failed businesses -- heaping them all on Mr. Florio's shoulders.

HEADLINE: Peggy Dennis Dies; Former Communist And Writer Was 84

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Peggy Dennis, a Communist organizer and author, died on Sept. 25 at the Jewish Home for the Aged in San Francisco. She was 84.
The cause was complications from several strokes, said her son, Eugene Dennis Vrana. 
 Ms. Dennis was the wife of Eugene Dennis, general secretary of the American Communist Party from 1946 to 1959 and one of 12 American Communists jailed in the late 1940's for violating the Smith Act by conspiring to overthrow the Government. Ms. Dennis worked mostly in internal party organizing and for many years served as a courier of messages to Communist leaders in Germany, Poland, France and other countries.
After 1949, she worked primarily as a journalist at The Daily Worker and The People's World. She also wrote many freelance articles on politics and economics for socialist and liberal magazines including The Progressive and The Nation. She moved to San Francisco in 1961 after Mr. Dennis died.
In 1977, a year after she resigned from the Communist Party because of differences with its leadership, she wrote a book based on her experiences as an organizer, "The Autobiography of an American Communist: A Personal View of a Political Life."
A documentary about her life with Mr. Dennis, called "Love in the Cold War," was produced in 1991 by American Experience and Windfall Films and shown on public television in 1992.
Ms. Dennis is survived by two sons, Mr. Vrana of San Francisco and Timur Timofeev of Moscow, and a niece, Laura Bock of San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Bid to Restore Haiti's Leader Is Derailed

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
The two-year-old effort to restore the elected President of Haiti to power was close to collapse today as the United States pulled a troop ship away from Haitian shores and called on the United Nations to renew economic sanctions against the military Government.
Faced with the refusal by authorities in Port-au-Prince, the capital, to allow a ship carrying American and Canadian military engineers and instructors to dock, and with violent demonstrations by Haitians on shore, Administration officials ordered the ship back to sea and said a second troop ship scheduled to leave for Haiti Wednesday would not depart. 
 The steps effectively suspended American military involvement in the agreement reached in July to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the office from which he was ousted in a military coup in September 1991.
 
Clinton Demands Guarantees
 President Clinton, already under criticism over the deaths of 25 American troops in Somalia, said United States soldiers would not return to Haiti until the country's military leaders guaranteed the security of the advisers and the safe return of Father Aristide.
"I have no intention of sending our people there until the agreement is honored," President Clinton said. "What I intend to do now is press to reimpose the sanctions."
American officials also emphasized that they expected Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, leader of the military Government, to retire on Friday, as he had agreed under the accord to return Father Aristide to power by Oct. 30.
 
Ship Diverted to Guantanamo
 Pentagon officials said the ship, the Harlan County, a tank-landing ship with 175 American and 25 Canadian engineers and advisers aboard, would go to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
As the ship steamed out of Haitian waters, Haitians jubilantly danced, cheered and fired guns into the air on the shore. [Page A12.]
The decision to withdraw the ship came one day after it was blocked from landing at Port-au-Prince by armed demonstrators who were apparently directed by Haitian security forces opposed to the return of Father Aristide. The violence forced a hasty retreat from the harbor area by the United States charge d'affaires, Vicki Huddleston, and other diplomats.
 
Pressure at Home
 But Administration officials acknowledged that the decision to remove the ship was also influenced by the public and Congressional reaction to the death of American soldiers serving with United Nations peacekeepers in Somalia.
"It's obviously caused increased scrutiny by the Congress and the public of any projection of American military personnel," one senior Administration official said.
But President Clinton stressed that he did not believe the retreat of the troop ship meant the process to restore Father Aristide was at an end. "I do not think it is dead," he told reporters on the South Lawn as he departed for a speech in North Carolina. "I still think it will come back to life."
Father Aristide, speaking in Washington, supported the President's call for a renewal of sanctions.
"Those killers stopped the process yesterday and their removal is indispensable to the restoration of democracy," he said. "I already have the names to replace them."
The Administration's suspension of its role in carrying out the agreement, which had been painstakingly negotiated in July during talks on Governors Island in New York, throws the situation back to where it was in June, when the United Nations Security Council ordered an oil embargo and other economic sanctions against Haiti.
General Cedras and Col. Joseph Michel Francois, the police chief of Port au Prince, are not expected to leave office quietly, as both are supposed to do, and the Administration said it had no intention of using troops to force their removal.
"If one side is reneging, we're not going to shoot our way in there," a senior Administration official said. "They buckled before under the threat of sanctions."
 
Parallels to Somalia
 Even before the developments of the last two days, the Pentagon was a reluctant participant in the Haiti mission, and some members of Congress have recently drawn pointed parallels to United States losses in Somalia.
"We cannot support, indefinitely or in perpetuity, governments -- no matter how much we want to," said Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat. "We can't sent 600 troops into Haiti and expect to become the police force and the army of Haiti."
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who chairs a House subcommittee that oversees policy in the Caribbean, said the Administration needed to rethink the purpose of its mission in Haiti.
"If, indeed, the mission is solely to train security forces, there should now be a change and have them trained in the United States," Mr. Torricelli said. "If the training was really a cover to interject the American military into Haitian affairs, then the Administration is being naive."
But Representative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat whose district contains a large number of Haitian-Americans, expressed "disappointment" in the decision to withdraw the ship, and suggested it was the result of public disquiet over Somalia.
"I recognize a political decision was being made," Mr. Rangel said.
He added that the Administration needed to take urgent action to salvage the Governors Island agreement. "I think we've lost a lot of prestige in the international community," he said, "and it will take the strong response of the President to get us back on the track we were on."
The 600 United States troops are part of an international contingent of 1,300 who are to help Haitians rebuild roads, hospitals, schools and other structures. They are also to train a newly constituted Haitian army. Under the agreement, the international troops are to be lightly armed and would not intervene with force even if they saw Haitian soldiers committing violence.
President Clinton said today that after the threats expressed on Monday toward United States diplomats in Port-au-Prince and the unwillingness of Haitian authorities to control the small mob of demonstrators, he was unsure whether the light weaponry was sufficient.
"The Department of Defense and our military leaders are convinced that the relatively light arms that our people were supposed to carry as advisers are more than adequate to protect themselves as long as the Governors Island agreement is being honored," Mr. Clinton said. "But I am not about to let them land to test it."
Pentagon officials said that Secretary of Defense Les Aspin would again press for the adoption of some of the conditions he proposed last week prior to the sailing of the Harlan County: legislation separating Haiti's military and police forces, the removal of General Cedras and Colonel Francois and a statement from Father Aristide that he welcomes United States military personnel.
Because of the 19-year occupation of Haiti by United States marines beginning in 1915, Haitian politicians are reluctant to embrace the idea of American soliders on their soil.

HEADLINE: Policing a Global Village

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
A clearer demonstration of the global village that modern communications have created, and the land-mines that await American Presidents as a result, would be difficult to imagine.
After more than a dozen American soldiers were killed in street-fighting in Somalia 10 days ago, President Clinton argued that it would be dangerous for the United States to pull out its troops at once, because doing so would only encourage "aggressors, thugs and terrorists" all over the world. 
 Still, he yielded some ground, setting a deadline for full withdrawal by March 31. On American television last weekend, a number of leading Senators went further, suggesting that an earlier withdrawal would be better and warning against sending American units to Bosnia and Herzegovina or Haiti.
 
U.S. Landing in Haiti Fails
 As if on cue, a small gang of toughs, protected by the police, took to the streets of Port-au-Prince, threatening to create "another Somalia" to prevent American troops and other advisers from landing to help in a transition to democratic government that the demonstrators evidently do not want. Some of their leaders said they had been encouraged by what they saw on television.
Mr. Clinton promptly ordered a suspension of the American military effort in Haiti, a country whose entire armed forces consists of 7,000 members, of whom 1,500 are policemen. With the whole United Nations plan for stabilizing Haiti seemingly undermined, economic sanctions are to be tried again.
"So we have a group of 40 or 50 people -- O.K., maybe a hundred or two -- causing the United States and the United Nations to stop dead in their tracks," said a rueful American policy maker. "Somalia, Bosnia and Haiti don't have much in common, except their problems are complicated, what happens in one affects another and the country has no stomach for any of them."
 
'Virtual Collapse' of Leadership
 Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, a Republican known both for his expertise in foreign affairs and for his judiciousness, spoke today of what he termed "the virtual collapse of Presidential leadership in these matters."
"The roof has fallen in," Senator Lugar said in a telephone interview. "There is no significant Congressional support for the President's policy in any of the three countries, and it's his own fault. A few people have stood beside him, but not because they agree with him. They are doing it solely out of loyalty to the Constitution and the role of the Commander-in-Chief."
That is so, he declared, because of failure by Mr. Clinton to discuss with Congress either the change of goals in Somalia from feeding the hungry to nation-building and pursuing Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, the elusive factional leader, or the plan for trying to restore democracy to Haiti.
 
Legislative 'Safety Net'
 "A President needs to coopt the leadership of Congress in any foreign-policy venture, however small, and the sooner the better," Mr. Lugar said. "That gives him a safety net if things go wrong, as they usually do, either temporarily or definitively."
Mr. Clinton's advisers depict themselves as pioneers, groping their way toward new principles in a post-Cold War world. It is uncharted ground, and they admit that they are having trouble. No one has had to do this, they say, since the 1950's, and containment was not a policy born overnight.
"Every one of these situations involves a lot of imponderables," a senior State Department official said. "It's not easy to define our national interests, to decide when to intervene, to see all the consequences of intervention, to know when to declare victory and end the intervention. And there's no upside. You win, and nobody in the general public cares much, you lose American lives and the country demands that you pull your horns in."
The President's top foreign-policy advisers, most of them formed in the Vietnam years, are unwilling to sharply limit the exertion of American power and influence, even in an era of scarce financial resources and even when they know their boss wants to spend most of his energy on domestic affairs.
 
Speech on Somalia
 But as Mr. Lugar remarked, Mr. Clinton has not done the spade-work on Capitol Hill; for that matter, he has not done it with the public at large. His speech last week about Somalia was well enough received, though some thought it lacked the zest and conviction of his address to a joint session of Congress on health care.
After it, however, polls showed that as many as 60 percent of American citizens still thought the United States should get out of Somalia, and in the Senate, there was still strong sentiment to do so before year's end.
There are obviously limitations on what sorts of foreign policies any President can sell, especially when American soldiers are dying and when the national interest is difficult to define. Lyndon B. Johnson discovered that in Vietnam, and his experience made his successors tread extremely carefully.
Mr. Clinton, on the other hand, has involved himself, or allowed himself to become involved, in a number of nettlesome problems at once. What is more, all of them have underlying political dimensions, too seldom fully explained, that make achieving what may seem like simple goals very difficult indeed.
 
Underlying Political Factors
 The problem in Somalia, for instance, was not really hunger; that was merely a symptom of the country's lack of anything approaching an effective government, and that, in turn, was merely a symptom of the hatred of one clan for another.
The real problem in Haiti is the reluctance of the military and the police to relinquish the power that they have enjoyed since the days of the Duvalier dictatorship, as they would have to do if the country is to gain a semblance of stability so its people will stop fleeing in small boats.
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a foreign affairs scholar at the Brookings Institution who has served in several Administrations, said the danger in what has happened now in Haiti was two-fold.
First, and most obviously, Mr. Sonnenfeldt said, it may send a signal to others elsewhere that "you don't have to do much to take a bite out of the superpower" -- precisely the point that Mr. Clinton made about Somalia. Beyond that, he said, "there is the possibility of a grave miscalculation" -- the chance that someone, somewhere, may watch the United States struggling to define new policies and try something that Washington cannot tolerate.
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq seems to have made just such a miscalculation on the basis of ambiguous American diplomacy, and the result was the war in the Persian Gulf.

HEADLINE: A Talent for Rewriting History

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Two iconoclasts who practically reinvented the field of economic history, Robert W. Fogel of the University of Chicago and Douglass C. North of Washington University in St. Louis, won the 1993 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday, the first time the prize was awarded for work in economic history.
"Bob and Doug are clearly the leaders of the new economic history, the most visible, the ones with the most impact," said Peter Temin, an economic historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 This is the fourth year in a row that the prize has gone to an economist at the University of Chicago, an institution that has fallen out of favor with some economists in the post-Reagan era.
 
Historical Puzzle Masters
 The professors were honored by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for "applying economic theory and quantitative methods" to historical puzzles, ranging from the role of the Ten Commandments in an economy to slavery in the antebellum South to starvation in England and America in the Industrial Revolution.
Credited with founding "cliometrics," as their rigorous, number-crunching brand of history came to be known (in Greek mythology, Clio is the muse of history), Professors Fogel and North were also praised by the academy for digging up large amounts of fresh data and creating huge computer data bases.
Professor North, 72, helped bring cliometrics to the fore through his work on Colonial American economics and as an editor of the Journal of Economic History in the early 1960's, where he published the work of young Turks, including Professor Fogel.
But Professor Fogel, 67, pudgy, bespectacled and somewhat rumpled, is the better known of the two, in large part because since his student days in the 1940's and 1950's he has been regarded as both brilliant and something of a bomb thrower.
 
Challenged Established Views
 A charming man who has attracted a following of top-notch students, Professor Fogel, the son of Russian immigrants, got a relatively late start in economics. By the time he arrived at Columbia University in the 1950's to study statistics, he had spent several years as a Communist youth organizer, married and had two sons.
The first assault on conventional wisdom by Professor Fogel, in a 1964 book based on his master's thesis, was to contend that railroads were not nearly so critical to American economic development as Joseph Schumpeter, Walt W. Rostow and other prominent historians believed. By contrasting history with a hypothetical alternative, Professor Fogel boldly concluded that railroads had contributed less than three percentage points to the growth of the economy and that industrialization depended less on big technological breakthroughs than on smaller innovations.
"Bob wants to be known as the supreme empiricist, the great numbers person, the person who establishes what a fact is," said a former student, Claudia Goldin, now an economics professor at Harvard. "It just so happens that the facts he establishes are rather controversial."
A book on slavery that he wrote with Stanley L. Engerman, "Time on the Cross" (Little Brown, 1974), touched off an intellectual firestorm and made Professor Fogel an instant celebrity. The book challenged the accepted view that slavery was a moribund system destined to self-destruct and that slaves were treated like concentration camp inmates, beaten, starved and worked to death.
Using provocative language and aiming for a mass audience instead of the academic world, Professor Fogel argued that the owners of slaves looked upon slaves as economic assets and treated them as they would treat livestock, that slavery was an efficient system for growing cotton and that the system collapsed for political -- not economic -- reasons.
Relying on everything from accounts of slave auctions to plantation medical records to crop yields, Professor Fogel asserted: "The typical slave field hand was not lazy, inept and unproductive. On average he was harder working and more efficient than his white counterpart." The book's last sentence reads, "It's time to reveal, not only to blacks but to whites as well, that part of American history which has been kept from them -- the record of black achievement under adversity."
Professor Fogel's views were never fully accepted, but even critics acknowledged that the professor's research altered the prevailing consensus on the economics of slavery.
When "Time on the Cross" was published, it was even attacked as racist, and the ensuing controversy was so bitter -- shattering friendships and splitting the profession -- and the questions raised were so numerous, that Professor Fogel subsequently wrote "Without Consent or Contract" (W. W. Norton, 1989) to clarify his findings and include a moral condemnation of slavery. Professor Fogel's wife of 44 years, Enid, a former dean at Harvard, is black.
Today his research, which focuses on the decline of hunger and the lengthening of life spans in Europe and America, remains unconventional, showing that starvation was a major problem far more recently than most people realize. At the time of the French Revolution, he shows, France had lower food consumption than India a century and a half later and roughly one-fourth of the growth in per capita income in Europe and America since that time can be traced to improved nutrition.
 
A Historical Theoretician
 Professor North is a diminutive and white-haired man with an effervescent personality, a dog named Clio and a fondness for fast cars and fine wine. In contrast to Professor Fogel, who is famous for particular propositions, Professor North is a theoretician among historians, associated with a methodology and a framework that emphasizes institutions and how they evolve over time.
"Economists generally believe that markets, not institutions, are what matters," Professor Goldin said. "What Doug pointed to is economic historians' keenest insight, which is that markets are embedded in institutions. And that institutions change slowly over time, and therefore, that history matters."
One of the few controversies Professor North caused came in selling bottles of wine to his fellow cliometricians at the historians' annual conferences -- at a significant markup.
Professor North said yesterday that his work had gained greater currency since the collapse of Communism -- and the struggle to build market economies in countries where market-friendly institutions have not existed for half a century, if ever.
"Political institutions are as important as economic institutions," he said. "What happened in Central and Eastern Europe radically changed views about economic theory. Economists have no theory about that kind of change."
He added that accepted theory suggests that just putting a macroeconomic policy in place is not enough and that there also must be a body of law -- patent law, contract law, property rights -- "that gives people the right incentives to engage in economic activity."

HEADLINE: ISRAEL SELLS ARMS TO CHINA, U.S. SAYS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Israel has sold advanced military technology to China for more than a decade and is moving to expand its cooperation with Beijing, says R. James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence.
The C.I.A. assessment was provided in written responses to questions by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee made the assessment public last week as part of a report on recent hearings it conducted on "proliferation threats of the 1990's," a committee aide said on Monday. 
 There have been many news reports about the sale of Israeli military technology to China, which did not establish diplomatic relations with Israel until 1992, and the Rand Corporation has made similar assessments. The C.I.A.'s response to the committee was reported on Monday by NBC News and confirmed by the aide.
 
Jets, Missiles and Tanks
 The C.I.A. says China has been acquiring advanced military technology from Israel for more than a decade on programs for jet fighters, air-to-air missiles and tanks. The agency said the sale of Israeli military technology to China "may be several billion dollars."
Despite the previous reports, the bluntness of the C.I.A. assessment surprised Congressional specialists and appears to reflect a growing concern among American intelligence experts that China is seeking to use Israel to obtain the sort of advanced military technology that the United States and other Western nations have refused to sell to Beijing.
China's acquisition of military technology -- and re-export to Pakistan, Iran and other countries -- is a major challenge to Western efforts to stem the spread of dangerous weapons.
Explaining its assessment, the agency noted that Beijing and Tel Aviv recently signed an agreement to cooperate in sharing technology in a number of areas, including electronics and space. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel was visiting China today to discuss the broadening of ties.
 
Israelis Open Offices in China
 In addition, an increasing number of Israeli military companies have opened offices in China to sell their products.
The agency's assessment is likely to provoke calls by members of Congress for greater scrutiny of the sale of American military technology to Israel.
Ruth Yaron, a spokeswoman at the Israeli Embassy, said today that Israel had not transferred American military technology to China. "Israel adheres to all of its commitments to the United States with regard to its relationship with China," she said.
An Israeli diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that the four-paragraph C.I.A. statement to the committee did not say the Israelis had been re-exporting American technology.

HEADLINE: President Defends His Policies as Adding to Personal Security

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C. Oct. 11

 BODY:
Offering a broad defense of his Administration's domestic and international priorities, President Clinton said tonight that the United States "cannot withdraw from the world we have done so much to make."
Speaking to more than 40,000 students, alumni and staff members celebrating the University of North Carolina's bicentennial, Mr. Clinton tried to link his initiatives on expanded trade, crime control and health care. 
 But in a nod to recent events abroad that have tended to overshadow the more politically valuable domestic issues, Mr. Clinton emphasized the importance of maintaining a viable foreign policy agenda.
Paying attention to all of these priorities, the President said, Americans will be provided with a blanket of security that will see the nation through periods of economic and global turbulence.
"The security we seek is like a rope for a rock climber, to lift those who will take responsibility for their own lives to even greater pinnacles," he said.
The need for personal security, he said, demands the passage of his health care proposals that would provide insurance coverage for all Americans as well as anti-crime measures that restrict the sale of guns and add more police officers.
"We must protect our people better against the ravages of violence," he said. "Our people have a right to feel safe where they live, where they go to school and where they work."
In his speech, Mr. Clinton also emphasized the connection between foreign policy and domestic policy.
As for his efforts on the domestic front like health care reform and passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that many of the items he is asking Congress to approve must first overcome opposition in many quarters, including members of organized labor.
 
'Imposes a Responsibility'
 "Our communities won't be secure until people who disagree on everything else stop shouting at each other long enough to realize that we have to save the kids who are in trouble the same way we lost them -- one child at a time," he said. "And it imposes a responsibility on each and every one of us."
Mr. Clinton's appeal to personal security has emerged in recent weeks as his advisers have sought for an overarching thesis that could put the President's opponents on the defensive while lifting Mr. Clinton onto the high ground as he fights for passage of his health care plan -- even though Congress has not yet received an actual bill.
But Mr. Clinton has had some trouble maintaining that momentum as one foreign policy crisis after another -- including the turbulence in Russia, the killing of American troops in Somalia, and the rejection of American troops in Haiti -- has distracted him from the domestic issues he would prefer to address.
Today, for instance, Mr. Clinton and his aides devoted more energy to hammering out a way to beat a path out of Haiti than in selling any single domestic issue.
And in his remarks tonight, the President also acknowledged six soldiers killed in Somalia who were stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C.

HEADLINE: Is Women's Health Harmed By Medical Specialization?

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Medical care for most men is one-stop shopping: a trip to a general doctor for a physical examination that includes full preventive care. But that approach works poorly for a woman, new studies have shown, with tests like Pap smears often overlooked, particularly if the doctor is a man.
In practice, many women insure complete care by making the medical rounds: they visit a generalist, a gynecologist for Pap tests and maybe even a breast cancer specialist for breast examinations and mammograms. Now many public health experts are saying that there must be a better way. 
 "There is a growing and substantial body of evidence that for a long time women's health issues have not received enough attention," said Dr. Nicole Lurie, author of a recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine that highlighted some of the shortcomings in women's care.
 
Beginning in Adolescence
 "Previously we've talked about deficiencies on a national level -- in terms of not enough research on women's health. Now we are saying it's also a problem on a very basic clinical level -- that patients are not getting what they need."
Although many men as well as women find themselves visiting more than one doctor as they age, women's care is fragmented from adolescence on.
While most medical experts agree that a woman's basic medical care could be consolidated under one doctor, they debate whether that doctor should be an internist, a family practitioner, a gynecologist or a doctor who specializes in the new field of women's health.
Also, given that two recent studies have found male doctors to be lax in performing Pap tests and ordering mammograms, some women's health advocates are wondering whether women should be advised to seek out doctors who are women.
 
Shortcomings in Training
 "We favor provision of care by any type of primary care physician, but we feel that none of them right now are trained well in women's health," said Eileen McGrath, executive director of the American Medical Women's Association.
The association sponsored a conference yesterday in Washington to discuss ways to improve women's health care, and has designed a course to teach practicing general doctors "what they didn't learn in medical school."
President Clinton's proposal to overhaul the nation's health care system specifically guarantees coverage for Pap smears and mammograms, but on a slightly less frequent basis than the association and other women's health advocates would like to see. As a result, the details of such screening are under review.
Dr. Vicki Hufnagle, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Thompson Memorial Hospital in Burbank, Calif., says she believes that women need doctors devoted to their care. She recently opened a chain of women's health bookstores, called Her Body, and is organizing a women's hospital whose staff will include a urologist who focuses on treating women, a plastic surgeon who can remove defective breast implants and gynecologists who, where possible, will remove tumors without taking out the entire uterus or ovaries.
But she said that merely choosing a woman as a doctor might not guarantee good care. "All doctors are trained the same and learn the same myths about women's bodies, so you may feel more comfortable with a women, but you may not be better off," she said.
But Dr. Peter Franks, author of another recent study comparing the competence of male and female doctors in taking care of women, cautioned against jumping to the conclusion that the doctor's office was hazardous to women.
 
Superior Health of Women
 "It is politically correct to talk about how women don't get a fair shake from the health care system, and that's true to some extent, since most physicians are male," he said. "But if you look at medical outcomes, women do much better than men. They live longer, they have lower rates of mortality from the same diseases, they use the health care system more -- and more effectively."
There are no good statistics about where women currently get their medical care, although there is some evidence to suggest that women who are better educated and wealthier are more likely to have at least two doctors, a generalist and a gynecologist.
Although some health maintenance organizations require women who are enrolled in their plans to choose one primary doctor -- a family practitioner, internist or gynecologist -- others allow women to have a general doctor, as well as yearly visits to a gynecologist for Pap smears and pelvic examinations.
"Women get extremely mixed signals from the health care community about who should be their doctor," said Dr. Carolyn Clancy, director of primary care at the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research in Rockville, Md. "The issue to me is how and why gynecologic issues got separated out into a special area instead of being part of general care." Pap smears and breast examinations should be easy for doctors to learn and perform, Dr. Clancy said.
Unfortunately, health policy experts say that given current practice, they see potential drawbacks with both approaches.
"There may be problems with having two doctors," said Dr. Franks, who is an associate professor of family medicine at the University of Rochester. "Problems can fall between the cracks. But there may also be problems in having one, if that doctor cannot provide the needed range of services."
Public health experts say that many internists and gynecologists have become so specialized that they are no longer capable of full-service care. Internists, for example, may have no practical training in performing Pap smears or pelvic examinations. And gynecologists have no formal training in managing asthma or bronchitis or back sprains in nonpregnant women.
 
Lack of Practical Experience
 Although internists and family practitioners must all memorize the screening guidelines for women -- and have book knowledge of issues surrounding menopause and contraceptive counseling -- many have little practical experience in such areas.
"Even though there are guidelines for Pap smears and mammograms, what doctors do is different in practice," said Dr. Margo Krasnoff, assistant professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. "In terms of talking about menopause or nutrition, different doctors do drastically different things."
Dr. Clancy said she suspected that many women of childbearing age relied exclusively on an obstetrician-gynecologist for medical care. "A lot of family practitioners say ob-gyns don't have the training to do it," she said. "The gynecologists say, 'Of course, I provide it. I have to. I'm her only doctor.' "
And she added: "There is very little evidence about how good gynecologists are at general care. I think that there is evidence that women who go to one doctor right now -- whether a family practitioner, an internist or a gynecologist -- have great holes in their care."
In a recent study in The Annals of Internal Medicine, Dr. Alan Deitrich and his colleagues at Dartmouth sent actresses in their mid-50's posing as patients to hundreds of doctors' offices for checkups. Internists as well as family practitioners were included in the study.
Although Dr. Deitrich said that generally "the doctors did quite well in preventive care," he also pointed to a few disappointments, like the fact that only two-thirds performed breast examinations and few did any dietary counseling. The study could not establish whether the doctors properly performed Pap smears, since the actresses were instructed to say that they had had a Pap smear at a free clinic within the last six months. The doctors' visits lasted 5 to 60 minutes and the charge ranged from nothing to $108.
"I think women need to have some sense of what they want when they go for an annual checkup," Dr. Deitrich said.
Two recent studies comparing the effectiveness of male and female doctors in caring for women have also raised concerns. Dr. Lurie and her colleagues at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis surveyed the records of more than 100,000 women and found that female internists and family practitioners performed twice as many Pap tests as their male counterparts and ordered 40 percent more mammograms.
Most surprising, perhaps, is that the difference in care was greatest among younger doctors. Public health experts generally believe that younger doctors are best at preventive care, since such screening has only been added to medical education in recent years.
A similar study by Dr. Franks and Dr. Clancy, published this year in the journal Medical Care, found that women who used female doctors were more likely to have had a Pap test in the last three years and to have had a mammogram at some point in their lives. Male and female doctors did equally well in screening female patients for medical conditions that were not unique to women, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.
 
Possible Reason for Better Care
 The researchers in both studies cautioned that it was possible that women who sought out female doctors were more attuned to women's health issues and would have undergone more screening tests regardless of the advice of their doctors. But Dr. Lurie added that the very clear guidelines concerning mammograms and Pap smears should have reduced disparities and that even greater differences in care might exist in areas like menopause counseling, where the correct course was muddy.
"My sense is this is the tip of the iceberg with respect to issues of women's health," she said. "As women in the baby boom become perimenopausal, this will be a hot new issue that will probably be attended to differently by different doctors."
Dr. Franks said: "It did seem like women were more tuned into problems that women have. But that's not so surprising. If you look at race, you see that white physicians are less good at dealing with problems that affect minorities. In general, people are better at dealing with the problems of people like themselves."
While some health experts contend that the best way to improve women's health is to make women's care its own specialty, others favor improving the quality of medical education and general care.
"I personally would like to see general doctors have the skills and the psychosocial training to take care of both men and women," Dr. Krasnoff said. "I don't think creating a women's health specialty is going to help women's health-care needs in this country. Anyway, there are not enough female physicians to take care of all the women in this country."
To that end, Dartmouth Medical School now offers a women's health elective to internal medicine residents, where they get one-on-one training on health issues from pelvic examinations to contraception.
But Dr. Franks added that it was not the sex of a patient so much as race or economic status that disenfranchised patients from medical care.
"I do think we need to make a better effort -- I think it is being made -- to make sure that care is sensitive to gender," Dr. Franks said. "But I think issues are much less powerful than the issue of race or class when we're dealing with patients who are different than we are."

HEADLINE: Labor Secretary to Urge Clinton To Propose Minimum Wage Rise

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said today that he would urge the President to propose increasing the minimum wage, now $4.25 an hour, most likely by 25 cents.
But Mr. Reich said that the pay increase would be coupled with an increase in benefits, like insurance as provided under the President's health care plan, that could bring the value of the total increase to 50 cents an hour. 
 In an interview with reporters after speaking at the National Press Club, Mr. Reich said that how big the proposed increase in straight pay would be would depend on how much employers end up paying for other benefits, he said. He estimated that for many employers the cost of providing health insurance for minimum-wage workers, as President Clinton's health plan would require, would be from 15 cents to 35 cents an hour.
 
Backpedaling by Reich
 In an interview late today, after some White House officials had grown uneasy about Mr. Reich's suggestion of raising the minimum wage, the Labor Secretary backpedaled a bit, saying that he had not decided on any specific recommendation and that his proposal could end up amounting to less than 50 cents, including an increase in benefits.
Mr. Reich said he was convinced that a 50-cent-an-hour increase in the minimum wage would not lead to a net decrease in jobs -- an assertion disputed by many business lobbyists.
Mr. Reich has become the foremost champion of a higher minimum wage in an Administration in which some officials are leery of raising the minimum wage for fear of antagonizing the business community, already upset about the tax increases passed in Mr. Clinton's budget this summer.
Mr. Reich, saying he would make his proposal to the President within two weeks, defended the plan by explaining that the minimum wage, after accounting for inflation, was 30 percent below its 1968 level.
In addition, he pointed to studies by economists from Harvard University and Princeton University that show an increase in the minimum wage could actually increase employment by encouraging people who were not working to seek jobs.
"A 25-cent increase in the minimum wage to $4.50, combined with the health care plan, would be equivalent to quite a modest increase in employer costs for low-wage workers that would be within the range for which little or no adverse impact would be predicted," Mr. Reich said in a statement issued after his speech at the Press Club.
But Carlos Bonilla, chief economist at the Employment Policies Institute, a Washington research group financed by many companies with low-wage workers, asserted that the 50-cent increase would cause a loss of jobs and harm the economy.
"When you recognize that requiring all employers to pay health insurance can raise the cost for hiring some entry-level workers by $2,000 a year, it's incredibly insensitive to talk about raising these costs further with an increase in the minimum wage," Mr. Bonilla said. "You can probably do it without any catastrophic job loss, but you can't do it without any job loss."
Administration officials said the President's National Economic Council, which coordinates economic policy, had not yet received Mr. Reich's proposal. But some of the officials said that increasing the minimum wage was a politically sensitive issue and that Mr. Reich's recommendations might be scaled back.
In a memorandum he sent to President Clinton in July, Mr. Reich, without making a formal recommendation, indicated that he favored increasing the minimum wage to $4.50 an hour and then indexing it to keep up with inflation. "Indexing the minimum wage at $4.50 an hour is a minimum prerequisite to reaching the goal of lifting families of four with full-time workers out of poverty," he wrote.
His statement today was arguably more generous, because it envisioned an increase to $4.75, if increased health benefits are included. Mr. Reich said today that he had not decided whether to call for indexing the increase in the minimum wage.

HEADLINE: Clinton Will Recommend More Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton plans to propose an additional $10 billion to $15 billion in spending cuts later this month to make good on promises he made to win votes for his budget package in August, Administration and Congressional officials said today.
The new package of cuts, which will be spread over the next five years, is bound to create a storm on Capitol Hill, several lawmakers said. Some members of Congress think the anticipated package is too small, while others suggested that the proposed reductions would cause howls of protest from lawmakers whose favorite programs would come under attack. 
 Administration officials said the $10 billion to $15 billion in cuts would be proposed to Congress late this month, after passage of appropriations bills. Several officials said most reductions would ones recommended in Vice President Al Gore's report on trimming waste and streamlining the Federal bureaucracy.
Several influential lawmakers voiced disappointment with the size of the new package. "I wish I could persuade them to do more," said Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, who pressed President Clinton during the budget battle to be more aggressive about cutting the deficit. "For economic reasons and to give taxpayers confidence that we're paying attention, the cuts should be deeper. I'd like to see him start off with $7 to $8 billion in cuts the first year. Ten billion would be even better."
 
Other Plans for Savings
 Administration officials said one reason the proposed reductions would not be larger was that they plan to use some savings from Mr. Gore's efforts for programs against crime and to finance President Clinton's investment programs, including retraining efforts and high-speed trains. Congress sharply scaled back many of these programs in the budget battle.
One official said that with all the claims on the billions of dollars that the Vice President's waste-cutting program aims to achieve, the Administration might ultimately propose less than $10 billion in spending reductions.
Not all the additional savings would come from Mr. Gore's proposals, several officials said. The Administration might, for example, propose some reductions in money already appropriated for this year.
 
Hopes in Congress
 Like Senator Kerrey, Representative Timothy J. Penny, a Minnesota Democrat who negotiated with the Administration about spending reductions during the budget battle, said he hoped that the Administration would come up with more than $10 to $15 billion in cuts.
He said he was working with other Republicans and Democrats in Congress who hope to add to the President's package so it would make at least $50 billion more in spending cuts over the next five years.
"I was hoping the Administration would propose something in the $20 to $30 billion range for five years, and then we'd add to that," Mr. Penny said.
Several lawmakers said they feared that the Administration's spending reductions would be so small that they would be ridiculed, especially since Congress almost always cuts less than is proposed.
Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, a Pennsylvania Democrat who is a member of the bipartisan group looking for additional cuts, said the group was working with the Administration to find new cuts in required spending for programs like Medicare. She was one of the last Democrats to vote for the President's budget package, helping provide its one-vote margin in the House.
She said the President had agreed to participate in a Dec. 13 conference in her district that will examine such programs. She won the Administration's commitment to participate in the conference before the budget was passed.

HEADLINE: Opposites in California Join to Fight Trade Pact

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The opposition President Clinton faces in selling the North American Free Trade Agreement has a thousand voices, and many of them could be heard at a lunch-hour rally here a few days ago.
From the bandstand, Eddie Starr, a steelworker from Granite City, Ill., led the crowd of 300 in a ballad of the moment: 
 Say no, say no,
Don't let them send our jobs to Mexico.
Say no, say no,
'cause Nafta's such a sorry way to go.
In the crowd are three young women wearing tags saluting the grizzly bear, the California condor and the giant kangaroo rat, animals they say the agreement would hurt.
There are Chinese-Americans and Mexican-Americans here, Gray Panthers and college students, as well as followers of Ross Perot, Jerry Brown, Ralph Nader and Jesse Jackson. In other times, carpenters' union leaders and the Sierra Club's defenders of trees would not have been seen on the same side of the street. They carry signs. "Nafta Pollutes." "Shafta Nafta." "For Workers. For the Earth. Labor & Enviros Working Together."
This is the grass of many roots. Here, and in states as diverse as Minnesota, Illinois, Georgia, Massachusetts and Michigan, coalitions of otherwise improbable allies have mounted an unusually broad campaign to try to stop a President from doing something that he insists would be good for them and that they are convinced would be anything but.
 
California Problems
 California, with unemployment at 9 percent and legions of environmental advocacy groups, is an epicenter of a loosely coordinated, low-budget struggle to bring pressure on Congress. Here, and throughout the state, the groups are directing their campaign at 10 to 12 of California's 52 House members to reject the agreement, which would gradually eliminate tariffs, quotas and other barriers to trade among the United States, Mexico and Canada.
For the moment, there's little doubt about whom the groups in San Francisco are after. The biggest banner they carry reads, "Save Your Job. Stop Nafta. Call Congr. Nancy Pelosi. 415-556-4682." Ms. Pelosi, who represents the Bay Area's Eighth Congressional District, is resolutely ambivalent about her vote, or, as she put it, "definitely undecided."
As lobbying organizations go, this one seems small potatoes. A tiny lobby in Washington, the Citizens' Trade Campaign, keeps track of local efforts but contributes little else. Craig Merrilees, director of California Fair Trade, which is coordinating the groups in the state, has a staff of one. His says his budget for this year is about $100,000, raised mostly from environmental foundations and a few labor unions.
 
Lesson of Polls
 What drives him, he says, are polls showing that the more people learn about the trade agreement the less they like it. And then there's the vigor of volunteers like Gladys Mendelson. Ms. Mendelson is a husky, 39-year-old member of the communications workers union whose regular job is climbing poles for Pacific Bell and installing telephone lines.
A die-hard San Francisco Giants fan, she parked her 1988 Ford Ranger outside Candlestick Park before games and covered it with signs with messages like, "Stop Nafta. Call Nancy Pelosi."
"First it was just me and my pickup," Ms. Mendelson said. "People come up. They ask me, 'What is Nafta?' Those are the ones I wanted." Other volunteers climbed aboard the truck to help hand out flyers.
Her problem with Nafta? "I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat," she said. "The Nafta was put together by Bush. Bush and Reagan did a good job of destroying America. Another big thing is the environment. Corporations going down there polluting the Rio Grande. People living in boxes. Drinking polluted water."
Picketing, demonstrating, sending out post cards, manning phone banks, stocking Ms. Mendelson with flyers -- the tactics of this campaigns -- are scheduled and organized at Wednesday night meetings, beginning promptly at 6, ending promptly at 7:30. Mr. Merrilees conducts them around a conference table at the offices of San Francisco Central Labor Council.
A disparate group of 35 men and 10 women gathers around the table and along the walls. Bundles of paper -- flyers and posters -- are passed around.
Mr. Merrilees took up what he perceived as an immediate threat to jobs in California: a gathering in San Jose sponsored by a business-relocation company. He passed around copies of a brochure from the concern, the PHH Fantus Company, that invites local business leaders to "meet personally with representatives from hundreds of business-friendly communities from across the nation and Mexico" and to learn about relocation issues like severance pay.
Mr. Merrilees told his group to go to the meeting and do some undercover work. "We need to send in some folks who say they're from XYZ Company," he said. "Ask about unions. Ask about the environment. Don't do anything illegal. But try to document what info they give the businessman."
Mr. Merrilees said the trade agreement would expand such business-relocation efforts.
Finally, he invited members of the group to report on meetings that they have had with Ms. Pelosi. What he heard was something about how politicians sit on the fence.
"I think Nancy Pelosi supports Nafta 100 percent," one man said. A woman from the Sierra Club reported, "She's leaning more or less our way." A Perot follower said she told him: "I've done the service of listening to you. Now I want to listen to my President."
Robert Lehman of the Coalition for Fair Trade said, "It was very hard to pin her down. She said: 'Maybe I'll make up my mind next week. Maybe I'll make it up five minutes before the vote.' "
 
Accurate Impressions
 Ms. Pelosi said they were reading her about right. The demonstrations and grass-roots alarm over Nafta "are a metaphor for the jobless of the last 12 years, the Reagan-Bush years," she said.
Is it possible that this exotic mix of compatriots will endure to tackle other big issues? "I don't care to be in bed with Ross Perot," said Jim Vaughan of a carpenters' local in San Francisco, "but this is an issue we agree on." Jaye Bell, a Perot worker, allowed only, "At this point, we're going issue by issue."
But Michael Knab of carpenters' local 217 in San Mateo County seemed to say conciliation was possible on any issue, including one that has divided environmentalists and people like him. "The spotted owl?" he said. "Yeah, that's a tough one. We need the jobs, but there's got to be a way so you don't have to cut every tree. We shouldn't be building on every available site. We want to be responsible, too."
Here, if not as yet with Ms. Pelosi, these alliances can bear fruit. Another politician, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, a Democrat who is running for Governor, credits the movement in part for her opposition to the pact.
Certainly, the state's battered economy contributed to her position, she said. So did dissatisfaction with what she said were inadequate modifications that the Clinton Administration negotiated.
"But," she said at a reception with labor union leaders last week, "the other piece -- this wide range of people who just didn't get it -- made it hard for me to make a case" that the agreement is good for the average Californian. Borrowing a slogan of the campaign, she said, "It just added up to 'not this Nafta.' "

HEADLINE: Asian Republic Still Caught in Web of Communism

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUSHANBE, Tajikistan

 BODY:
When the Soviet Union was disintegrating, one of the first statues of Lenin to be pulled down in Central Asia was in this sleepy capital. It was replaced by a statue of Abul Qasim Firdawsi, a 10th-century poet.
Yet today, poets and writers are in jail or exile, and on tree-lined boulevards, neon hammer-and-sickle emblems hang from the lampposts. 
 Two years after Tajikistan declared its independence, there is still no private ownership of land and the collective and state farms in the south, where cotton is king, still bear names like Lenin, Communism and Fifty Years of the U.S.S.R.
At the University of Dushanbe, Communists challenge democratically minded professors. The hallway in a rural primary school is lined with photographs of Tajik heroes of the Bolshevik Revolution.
 
Semi-Hemi-Demi-Communists
 "We are still a Communist country," said Safarali Boymnrodov, the school's principal.
In spite of all this, Tajik and foreign observers insist, the Government is not really Communist. The Tajik leaders, these observers say, have no deep ideological commitment, but are devoted primarily to staying in power. A local university professor said it would be more accurate to describe the Government as totalitarian.
Whatever the labels, Government officials are not talking. Repeated requests for interviews drew no response.
For all the Government's shortcomings, however, it has the backing of Moscow and Washington because the alternative, as they see it, is a Government under the influence of radical Islamic elements from abroad.
 
The Russian Presence
 The main backer is Russia, which has more than 20,000 troops in Tajikistan whose primary mission is to keep fighters, weapons and drugs from entering from Afghanistan. There are almost daily skirmishes between Afghan and Russian troops.
The fighting is an outgrowth of violence last year that convulsed Tajikistan, a backwater nation of about 5.6 million people that is slightly larger than New York State. Though no one knows for sure, it has been generally reported that at least 20,000 were killed and that more than half a million were forced to flee their homes.
But the struggle is not a battle between Communism and Islamic fundamentalism. Though the Islamic Renaissance Party, which is supported by Iran, was a faction in the opposition, it did not call for an Islamic state, and now even Iran's influence has faded.
 
The Minority Peoples' Presence
 Nor is the fighting an ethnic conflict, like those in Georgia and Azerbaijan. There are ethnic divisions here; Uzbeks make up about 24 percent of the population. But the political strife arises mainly from clan and regional loyalties.
Under the Soviet Union, the government of Tajikistan was made up mostly of people from the northern province, which was known as Leninabad but was renamed Khojand. They ruled in an alliance with the southern province of Kulyab. The mountainous eastern regions, Garm and Pamir, the poorest areas of the poorest of the Soviet republics, were left out.
Once the firm Soviet hand was gone, the Garmis and Pamiris began demanding a larger share of government resources and formed a loose alliance with organizations espousing everything from Islam to Tajik nationalism to democracy.
For a while Moscow remained neutral. But worried about the increasing influence of the Muslims in the opposition, Russia sent up to 20,000 troops to support a Government headed by a hard-line Communist from Kulyab, Emomali Rakhmonov. Mr. Rakhmonov and his backers also had military help from neighboring Uzbekistan, whose President, Islam Karimov, is another hard-line Communist.
Russia is now providing Tajikistan with at least half its budget, as well as key military units. But the Tajik leaders cannot seem to decide whether they want Communism or capitalism, democracy or one-party rule.
 
The Presence of Corruption
 Some confusion is due to corruption, which according to several diplomats and United Nations officials reaches into the highest levels. For example the Government is reluctant to break up the state farms because they provide jobs for people willing to pay bribes.
Former Communist countries in Eastern Europe have discovered that the place to begin privatization is in the service sector -- hairdressers, laundries, television-repair shops. But even that has not happened here, because the head of the Government agency that oversees this sector does not want to lose his lucrative fief.
What Tajikistan needs, several diplomats suggested, are international organizations to engage in small-scale development. But the country is not likely to get much help because of the human rights situation.
 
The Presence of Terror
 Last winter, after gaining control of Dushanbe, the Government and the forces that backed it went about eliminating the opposition. "It was a real blood bath," a Western diplomat said.
People were stopped on the street or pulled out of bread lines and required to show their identification papers. If they were Garmis or Pamiris, they were taken away. Many were shot.
The abuses continue. In late July, for example, Saidshov Shoev, a member of Parliament, was abducted. Maj. Jorgen Muller, a military adviser to the United Nations, said Mr. Shoev was taken away in a Government car.
"I do not know where my sons are, nobody will help me," said Mr. Shoev's mother, Adolat Shoeva. She said she had made repeated inquiries to Government officials but had received no response.
 
'People Disappear'
 No one knows how many political prisoners there are or how they are being treated. The Red Cross has sought access to prisoners, but the Government has said the organization can only visit prisoners who have been tried. That ban excludes nearly all political prisoners. Under Tajik law, a person can be detained for 18 months before trial.
"People continue to disappear," Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister for Central Asia, Georgi Kunadze, said recently.
Fear is pervasive. Almost no one will criticize the Government, and those who do insist on anonymity. The newspapers that flourished immediately after independence have been closed, their editors and reporters now dead, jailed or exiled.
Western diplomats and United Nations officials say Russia has been pushing the Government to improve the human rights situation and become more democratic. But how hard Russia is pressing is uncertain.
 
A Poet Is Jailed
 When Gulchera Sobir, wife of Bozor Sobir, a Tajik poet who was jailed in March on charges of anti-Government activities, asked the Russians for help in getting her husband freed, the Russian diplomats told her there was nothing they could do because neither she nor her husband are Russian citizens.
Mrs. Sobir said Russian diplomats told her that her husband had written poems against Communism, but she said this was not true. "His poems were about our fatherland, about our desire to be independent," she said.
A university professor said of Mr. Sobir: "He was fighting for independence of Tajikistan. Now we celebrate independence and he sits in jail."

Chart/Map: "Tajikstan at a Glance"
 
HISTORY: In the 16th century, Tajikistan became a province in a group of Turkish republics. By the mid-19th century, Tajikstan was divided among competing regional factions. Russia took control in the 1880's and 1890's. After the 1917 Russian Revolution, regions of Tajikstan rebelled against Communist rule until 1921. In 1929, it became a republic of the Soviet Union. It declared its independence in 1992, as the Soviet Union was collapsing.
 
GOVERNMENT: The Government is dominated by former Communists, who came to power at the end of 1992 after many months of political violence, near anarchy and civil war. The Government is run by a Parliament that was elected when the country was still part of the Soviet Union, and remains the same structure. Political parties that formed after independence have been banned, but the Communist party, once banned, has been allowed to reorganize. Elections have been promised, but are not scheduled.
 
ECONOMY: The country is one of the poorest of the 15 former Soviet republics, and it relies on agriculture, primarily cotton, and a limited industrial sector. It possesses potential hydropower resources, oil and minerals (uranium, mercury, lead and others).
 
POPULATION: 5,680,000
 
ETHNIC GROUPS: Tajak 62%, Uzbek 24%, Russian 8%, Tatar 2% and others 4%
 
RELIGION: Sunni Muslim 80%, Shiite Muslim 5%, others 15%.

HEADLINE: North Korea Assails Atomic Unit, Asks U.S. Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 12

 BODY:
In its continuing campaign to avoid international inspections of suspected nuclear weapons, North Korea issued a blistering attack today against the International Atomic Energy Agency and said only direct talks with the United States could resolve the crisis.
The broadside, issued in the name of North Korea's Minister of Atomic Energy and carried by the official news agency, described a bizarre plot that it said was intended to discredit the country. The plot involved a letter North Koreans said was a forgery by the International Atomic Energy Agency that suggested North Korea was developing nuclear bombs. 
 Intelligence reports indicate the existence of a secret nuclear program, but North Koreans have long denied that intention and permitted some inspections earlier this year. North Korea has condemned demands for new inspections -- to which it agreed when it joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -- as a violation of sovereignty.
There is evidence of a nuclear program and North Korea has test-fired a missile this year that could reach Japan, but some United Nations members do not want to isolate further what is already one of the most isolated nations on earth or impose an economic embargo on a country where malnutrition is believed to be rampant.
The Communist Government has steered an uneven course for months in efforts to keep inspectors away from two sites in the north of the country that are believed to contain evidence that North Korea is stockpiling nuclear materials for a bomb.
At North Korea's request there have been two meetings between senior American and North Korean officials, but Washington has said the discussions cannot continue until Pyongyang resumes discussions with the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and with South Korea.
The North Koreans refuse to recognize South Korea as legitimate.
But even while it was accusing the agency of being "closely linked with the base swindle of political charlatans," North Korea sought to project a conciliatory image at the same time by meeting with an American politician.
Representative Gary Ackerman, head of the House Asia-Pacific Affairs subcommittee, met with North Korea's President, Kim Il Sung, this week.
Mr. Ackerman, a Democrat who represents Queens, Nassau and Suffolk counties, was then allowed to walk across the heavily fortified demilitarized zone at Panmunjom. It was apparently the first such crossing in decades by an American official .
In a telephone interview, Mr. Ackerman indicated the talks were long on symbolism but short on substance. While there have been numerous reports that North Korea's economy is on the verge of collapse and that there are widespread food shortages, Mr. Ackerman said he was told the country had enjoyed bumper crops this year.
He said that he was also given "personal assurances" by Mr. Kim that Pyongyang was not and would not develop nuclear weapons, but that his calls for the Government to permit inspections to confirm this were rebuffed.
The North Korean broadside said that the International Atomic Energy Agency had forged the name of Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on a statement read before the General Assembly last month. The message said that the agency would have to close ranks to halt nuclear proliferation in countries like North Korea.
Among other things, the North Koreans said they were angry at being referred to in the message as North Korea, rather than the official Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
David Kyd, the chief spokesman for the agency, said that the North Korean attack appeared to be focused on a standard message. He denied there had been any forgery.
The North Korean statement said Mr. Boutros-Ghali had disclaimed the message, but a United Nations spokesman called it "completely valid."
He said "it is a message from the Secretary General to the conference, and any allegation that it is a forgery is nonsense," the spokesman said. He acknowledged that the document did not use the country's formal name.

HEADLINE: S. I. Secession Could Avoid Big Tax Rise

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Staten Island could become independent from New York City without imposing huge tax increases on its residents, a state panel studying the issue said yesterday.
In its last report before Staten Island's 379,000 residents vote in November on a proposal to secede from New York, the State Charter Commission for Staten Island said yesterday that the island as its own city could provide comparable services to its residents without the sharp increases in taxes some experts have predicted would be necessary. 
 The commission has in the past said that the amount of revenue raised from Staten Island each year is about $170 million less than the amount the island receives in New York City services. But in its new report the commission said costs on services could vary widely depending on the scope and type of services that islanders were willing to accept. Some services, such as jails, it said, could even be provided more cheaply on a smaller scale.
The 13-member commission, formed in 1990 to study the impact of secession and provide options for voters, looked specifically at providing jails, police training and 911 emergency services as examples of the problems secession might bring.
 
Growing Support
 The report by the commission, which has made no recommendation for or against secession, came amid evidence of growing support for the proposal. Guy Molinari, the Borough President, will formally announce his support today, said an aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Although yesterday's report did not analyze the costs of creating some larger government programs -- including schools and social services -- it said that jails, police training and 911 emergency services were selected because they are not provided on Staten Island now, and therefore might be expected to require large outlays for new construction and other start-up costs.
But compared to what Staten Island residents now pay in New York City taxes for comparable services, secession would not cause serious strains, the commission said.
"It is doable," said Joseph P. Viteritti, a professor of management at New York University and executive director of the commission. Although he declined to say whether secession could be accomplished without any tax increases, residents of Staten Island "can provide a comparable level of service without greatly increasing revenues," he said.
The commission did outline some problems. In some cases, they said current services might be impossible to duplicate.
 
911 Service Is a Concern
 For instance, the commission said, setting up a new 911 emergency phone number for Staten Island might not be possible because such services require the allocation of a special radio frequency from the Federal Communications Commission, and none are now available. The likely solution would be for Federal officials to require New York City to share its 911 system with the island. But the commission said it didn't know what the price tag would be.
In creating other new services, the commission said, residents of a City of Staten Island would face tough choices over the type and scope of municipal programs.
The island, which now has no jail, might pay New York City to incarcerate its prisoners at a projected cost of $14.6 million a year or build its own jail, which would cost an estimated $15.1 million annually, including $3.9 million a year to pay off its debt for construction. Other options include splitting up its jail population by sending its maximum security prisoners back to New York City, and building its own jail for lesser offenders. The estimated yearly cost: $15.8 million in combined payments to New York City, operating costs and construction debt.
In a report in July 1992, the commission had said the island generated $955 million a year in property, sales and income taxes, Federal and state aid and debt service, compared to the $1.13 billion it received annually in city services.
That led some officials, particularly opponents of secession in the Dinkins administration, to a conclusion that the commission said yesterday had been far off base -- that the government of a newly created City of Staten Island would immediately face a $170 million budget shortfall.
The commission is chaired by John Marchi, a Republican state senator from Staten Island. All of its members are Staten Island residents and most, according to Mr. Viteritti, have expressed personal support for the proposal. But he said that support has not influenced the research because that has been done largely by outside consultants from New York University and elsewhere who do not live on Staten Island.
Although he has until now been neutral on secession, Mr. Molinari has said that tax increases would be all but inevitable. In his announcement today, according to his staff, he is to provide new analysis of the economic impact of secession.
The proposal is widely expected to win a majority in the election next month. But Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the state Legislature would have to approve it before the island could secede, and all sides agree that the bigger a margin of support from residents, the more pressure Albany would feel to go along.
The state commission said yesterday that Staten Island residents would face a myriad of decisions, and in some cases might elect to pay for programs that cost more than it now costs for services from New York City. But they might also save money by offering comparable services on a smaller scale, the commission said.
In one example, it said the cost of constructing a new jail, although high, might lead to savings because it could be expected to be built within walking distance of the existing Staten Island courthouse. Because prisoners could then simply walk to their court proceedings under police escorts, the high costs paid by New York City to transport thousands of prisoners from more than a dozen jails to the court appearances would be averted.
 
What About Police?
 One difficult decision that would have be made by a newly created Staten Island government would be whether to train its police at the New York City Police Academy, which is widely regarded as the nation's best.
Richard J. Koehler, a professor of criminal justice at John Jay College and former Commissioner of Corrections in New York City, who was hired as an analyst by the commission, said yesterday that Staten Island would pay far more to continue using the New York City academy that it would to create its own school.
But Mr. Koehler said the high cost of New York City police training might be worth it, particularly for specialized classes. He recommended that some, if not all, Staten Island recruits be sent through the New York City academy.
Although the report did not provide an estimate of the overall costs of creating a new police department, it said one problem not likely to be faced was recruiting experienced police away from New York City.
"Based on the number that we already know would prefer to transfer to Staten Island, it should not be a problem at all," Mr. Koehler said.

HEADLINE: A Surge in Advocacy Within Parent Groups;
P.T.A.'s Shift From Bastions of the Status Quo to Challengers of Authority

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Until recently the parents at Public School 154 in Flushing, Queens, played little role in school life, split as they were into immigrant groups from 20 countries and harried by the demands of their jobs.
But last month, after school officials ordered P.S. 154 closed and the children bused elsewhere until the building was certified to be free of asbestos, parent leaders blanketed the neighborhood with pamphlets printed in Chinese, Spanish, Arabic and Farsi, rallying scores of parents to a school boycott. 
 Overnight, school officials cut through the red tape, producing reports that showed the school to be safe, and ordered it opened.
"The authorities took us seriously because we knew how to scream," said Valerie Cohen, who became president of the school's parent association last year.
 
'Renaissance Occurring'

The tactics parents used at P.S. 154 show just how much times have changed from the days when the P.T.A. organizations were essentially fund-raising.
A host of societal shifts, from the movement of women into the work force to new arrivals of foreign immigrants, have radically transformed the P.T.A.'s of New York and the nation.
If parent organizations in their heyday were mainly middle-class bastions of the status quo that collaborated closely with school officials, today they are smaller, scrappier groups with rainbow memberships that often challenge authorities over everything from teacher hiring to classroom violence. After a 25-year decline in membership, there is now a resurgence.
"There is a renaissance occurring," said Jeanne Frankl, who recently retired as executive director of the Public Education Association, an advocacy group. "The movement that is emerging has the style of the 90's. It reflects the parents who are in the school system now."
The surge in activism has manifested itself in a variety of ways in recent years. After a knifing last year at Eastern District High School, Brooklyn parents refused to allow their children to attend classes until school officials increased security. In the Bronx, parents persuaded politicians through years of protests and lobbying to give them a new school. At the High School of Graphic Communication Arts, Manhattan parents forced teachers to back away from an early dismissal plan that they said cheated students of classroom time.
The activism accelerated during the asbestos crisis. The police were called to at least 13 separate parent protests on Sept. 20, the first day of school this fall, and there was at least one school protest somewhere in the city virtually every day during September.
"There's a lot of pent-up anger," said Ayo Harrington, president of the United Parents Associations, New York's oldest citywide parents group.
 
Decline and Rebound
 Nationwide, the most prominent group is the National P.T.A., with its headquarters in Chicago, comprising of 27,000 school-based parent-teacher associations. Although the National P.T.A. has registered the name "P.T.A.," many groups in New York City include teachers and call themselves P.T.A.'s even though they are not affiliated with the national organization. Others that do not include teachers call themselves Parent Associations.
Nationally and in New York City, membership in parent organizations peaked in the 1960's before beginning a steady decline. The National P.T.A. had 12 million dues-paying members in 1961. Twenty years later, membership had fallen to five million; it has rebounded to seven million. While the baby boomlet of the 80's means more children are in school, the P.T.A. attributes the new membership chiefly to a rise in volunteerism.
Educators and academics said that powerful social and economic forces caused the overall decline in membership. Driving the P.T.A. from its inception were the energies of thousands of mothers donating their free time to their schools. From 1960 to 1990, that volunteer force shrank sharply as the percentage of American women with jobs rose from 35 percent in 1960 to 54 percent in 1990, according to census figures.
In New York City, the shifting fortunes of the United Parents Associations, a citywide federation of school-based parent groups, reflected the changes. Founded in 1921, the U.P.A. was a major force in improving the city's school system in the 1930's and 1940's, and by the 1960's, it was a prosperous organization with a largely white membership of some 400,000 members in 450 schools. Local chapters sustained neighborhood schools with cake sales and raffles.
But the struggles over desegregation and decentralization of the late 1960's weakened the U.P.A., often pitting parent organizations in largely black and white neighborhoods against one another. Many white parents who had been U.P.A. stalwarts left the city for the suburbs, and others devoted their energies increasingly to their local school boards after the system was decentralized in 1970.
Twenty years later, the U.P.A. had disappeared completely from 250 schools and only a handful of loyalists were active in many of the schools still affiliated. The organization that once occupied a posh Madison Avenue headquarters with 16 paid workers was sharing a downtown office with several other nonprofit groups and had no staff at all.
"The U.P.A. was in very hard times, almost a nonentity," said Jan Atwell, who became a vice president in 1985 and who later, as its president, helped rebuild the organization.
 
Growth in Voluntarism
 The parent movement's recovery is taking many forms; vigorous new leadership is one sign. Ms. Atwell's successor at the head of the organization is Ms. Harrington, who was educated at Malcolm X Liberation College in North Carolina, Ms. Harrington has sought to make up for the U.P.A.'s diminished numbers by forcefully articulating parent concerns through the media.
The movement is recovering nationally, as well. "We're seeing new growth in voluntarism, but of a different type," said Kathryn Whitfill, president of the National P.T.A. More fathers are participating, and instead of bake sales, many P.T.A. chapters are fighting for school financing by lobbying local governments, Mrs. Whitfill said.
In New York City, new groups have emerged. One is the Parents Coalition, the only citywide parents group with a full-time staff. Jon Moscow, its executive director, said he helped found the group in 1984 because he saw that even as parental activism declined over two decades, the power of the Board of Education bureaucracy, the teachers' union and other special interests were growing.
"This is a struggle and the issue is parent power," Mr. Moscow said. "Unions struggled to be taken seriously for workers, and parents have the same fight."
One instance in which the Board of Education failed to consider parents' needs, Mr. Moscow said, came when the board persuaded the teachers' union to defer wages during the 1991 budget crisis by establishing an annual, weeklong midwinter break that gives teachers time off but is a nightmare for working parents, who must arrange child care. The issue remains a source of bitter contention with the school system.
But in June, parents' groups claimed a victory when the seven-member Board approved extensive revisions to a 20-year-old document, known as the Blue Book, which outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groups.
Perhaps the parent leader who worked most tirelessly for the revisions was Lillian Lopez, a mother of two public school students and a member of the school board in District 15 in Brooklyn. In many ways, Ms. Lopez's own story reflects the evolution of the parents' movement.
Eight years ago, Ms. Lopez was just getting on her feet after two years of homelessness, riding the subways with her infant son. When she joined the P.T.A. at P.S. 15 in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn she found the group's focus on candy sale fund-raisers to be irrelevant to the school's needs. Over years of P.T.A. work, she changed the emphasis, starting an antidrug campaign in the Red Hook projects and training parents to be classroom tutors and conflict mediators.
Another mother who proved her leadership powers in school organizing is Juanita Rodriguez, who came to prominence a year ago after a schoolhouse stabbing ignited parent anger at Eastern District High School in Brooklyn. Ms. Rodriguez, president of the parents association, led parents into a two-day boycott that she called off only after wringing pledges from Board of Education officials not only to tighten security but also to relieve crowding and to initiate other programs, like a baby-sitting system for student mothers.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Give Up Early Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Treasury market gave up early gains yesterday and prices ended slightly lower amid nervousness about the September inflation figures, which are scheduled to be issued later this week.
Contributing to the market's concerns was a sharp jump in gold prices. 
 The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond, up more than half a point in early trading, closed unchanged. Its yield held steady from Friday's close of 5.92 percent.
Prices of short-term Treasury securities, meanwhile, were 1/32 point lower and intermediate maturities fell by as much as 4/32 point.
The Treasury market was closed in the United States on Monday, Columbus Day.
 
Prices Reverse Direction
 Treasury prices initially rose yesterday as bond traders returning from a long weekend continued to focus on what many considered a weak September jobs report on Friday.
The Labor Department said that while the unemployment rate held at 6.7 percent, the 156,000 jobs added in the month were concentrated in low-paying, part-time positions.
That and other indications of weakness in the report suggested that the economy was not growing fast enough to push up inflation, which can hurt the value of securities that pay a fixed rate of return.
But bond sellers emerged later in the day as the price of gold and other precious metals surged. Such movements are considered an indication of underlying inflationary pressures. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery jumped $7.50, to $369.20 an ounce.
Analysts said the rising precious metals prices apparently made some fixed-income investors nervous about the Producer Price Index, scheduled for tomorrow and the Consumer Price Index, on Friday.
Those worries spurred some holders of fixed-income securities to cash in on the recent run-up in bond prices, said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
 
Some Unpredictable Factors
 Economists generally expect the Producer Price and Consumer Price Indexes for September to show a continuation of the slow inflation trend this year. However, several unpredictable factors are creating concerns.
Matthew Alexy, market strategist at the First Boston Corporation, said that some manufacturers and distributors of gasoline might have raised their prices in anticipation of a Federal gas tax increase that took effect early this month.
In addition, he said auto makers had been inconsistent in discounting year-end prices, but that new model prices are not expected to rise as much as in previous years.
"They will be tricky numbers," Mr. Alexy said.
In its weekly bill auction, the Treasury sold $12.9 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.04 percent and a yield of 3.10 percent. An additional $12.8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.12 percent and a yield of 3.21 percent.
In secondary trading, the discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 2.99 percent. The discount rate on six-month bills rose four basis points, to 3.10 percent. And the discount rate on one-year bills rose three basis points, to 3.20 percent.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.53, to 1,336.35.
 
Funds Rate at 3%
 The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose to 3 percent, from 2.88 percent late Friday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10528/32 , up 8/32 point from late Monday. The average yield to maturity was 5.39 percent, down from 5.43 percent.
Following are the results of the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Both issues are dated Oct. 14, 1993. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 13, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on April 14, 1994.

HEADLINE: Relenting, Whitman Will Release Her Family's Income Tax Return for 1990

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman is going to give Gov. Jim Florio what he wants: her family's 1990 income tax return.
Mrs. Whitman will release the return by the end of the week, her spokesman said today, because, she says, she wants to get back to the important issues in the campaign.
The announcement was meant to upstage a news conference several hours later at which Governor Florio again criticized his Republican opponent for not releasing the information. 
 In August, Mrs. Whitman made public tax returns for 1989, 1991 and 1992, raising immediate questions as to why she withheld the 1990 returns after previously promising to "set the standard for disclosure."
 
Seizing the Issue
 Governor Florio, who has voluntarily released his returns every year since becoming Governor in 1990, immediately seized the issue in an effort to erode Mrs. Whitman's credibility on ethics.
James Carville, Mr. Florio's chief campaign consultant, brought up the issue again this morning in a call to the Trenton radio station New Jersey 101.5.
Later today, Carl Golden, the Whitman campaign spokesman, said: "The Whitmans' 1990 tax returns will be released before the week is out. If the Governor is that obsessed at peeking at them, they will be released."
Mr. Golden said the decision was not a response to Mr. Carville's comments, but rather an effort to return the focus of the campaign to topics like the economy, jobs and taxes.
"Let's get it out of the way and talk about things that are important," he said.
Governors, and candidates for the office, are not required to disclose personal income tax information.
Mrs. Whitman has said she was a private citizen in 1991, when the 1990 return was being prepared, so she saw no need to turn over the information.
She was a public figure and official in 1990, however. She stepped down as president of the State Board of Public Utilities in February 1990 to enter the Senate race against Bill Bradley.
The announcement today did not stop Mr. Florio from going ahead with his news conference, during which he called on Mrs. Whitman to release the tax documents immediately.
"In January, you may recall that Mrs. Whitman promised to set a new standard for disclosure of assets and income," he said in Edison. "Instead, she set a new standard for offering excuses."
Alan Rosenthal, a political science professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said he doubted whether the voters cared as much about the missing tax return as did Governor Florio.
But he said Mrs. Whitman allowed Mr. Florio to box her into a corner by releasing tax information for three of the last four years without a good explanation.
"I don't know that people running for governor ethically are bound to release all of their income figures, but when one does it it challenges the other," Professor Rosenthal said. "It's an ethics race."

HEADLINE: Stock Are Mixed, With the Dow Off 0.28

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday, with strength in brokerage issues, high-techs and some health care and pharmaceutical issues, but weakness in cyclical companies sensitive to the economy's direction.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which in early trading had raced above the 3,600 level, closed down 0.28 point, to 3,593.13. But, while the Nasdaq composite, heavily influenced by high-technology issues, and American Stock Exchange both closed at record highs. 
 Stronger than expected earnings reports from Motorola and Merrill Lynch helped other stocks in their industry groups move higher.
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for the Kemper Securities Group in Chicago, saw a market that could not make up its mind.
"There was no follow-through from last week, or even yesterday," he said. "What we saw were beaten-down sectors like health care, biotechs, and some selected technologies coming back to life, with gold stocks, responding to gold prices, going up as well."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 264 million shares traded, up from 183.2 million on Monday. The number of stocks posting gains outnumbered those posting losses by 1,081 to 937.
The Nasdaq composite rose 4.81 points, to a record closing high of 772.46, while the American Stock Exchange composite gained 2.91 points, to 470.50, also a record closing high.
Given the lack of economic data, earnings were the big factor in yesterday's session. The seimconductor sector responded to Motorola's better-than-expected third-quarter results. The company reported after Monday's market close that it earned 92 cents a share, versus 47 cents a share. Financial stocks benefited from strong third-quarter results issued by Merrill Lynch, which earned $3.14 a share, compared with $2.04 and Bear Stearns, 81 cents a share, versus 55 cents.
Centocor rose 3, to 14 1/4, as Prudential Securities upgraded the drug company to buy from hold. According to traders, Prudential sees a price target of $18 for the stock over the next 12 months. The company tied the rise to its Panorex drug data presented yesterday at a medical conference in Germany. The drug, designed to treat colonrectal cancer, extended the lives of patients in a five-year study.
US Healthcare rose 1 1/8, to 45, as it filed a petition with the Supreme Court of New York to annul rate cuts ordered by state regulators on Sept. 30.
 
Consolidated Paper Down
 Among the weak cyclicals, Consolidated Paper fell 2 7/8, to 40 1/8, after posting third-quarter earnings of 17 cents a share, down sharply from Street expectations of 38 cents a share. Also hurting the Dow was drops in Caterpillar, off 5/8, to 80 3/8, and Ford Motor, down 1/8, to 54 7/8.
CUC International, which is teaming up with A.T.& T. and Viacom to test an interactive home shopping network, rose 4 1/8, to 38 1/8, in active trading.
Investors unhappy with Hilton Hotels' lower third-quarter earnings, despite higher revenues, sold, causing the stock to decline 1 5/8, to 48 1/2.
Meca Software rose 1 1/8, to 6 1/2, after H& R Block and Meca announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby a Block unit would make a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Meca at a price of $6.625 a share.
Cardinal Distributors, a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals, surgical and hospital supplies, gained 3 1/2 to close at 40 after agreeing to acquire Whitmire Distribution for 8.3 million of its common shares valued at more than $400 million.
Solectron, which announced a 2-for-1 stock split yesterday, rose 2 3/8, to 54.

HEADLINE: F. B. Withington, School Headmaster And Principal, 71

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Frederic B. Withington, who retired in 1988 after 22 years as headmaster of the Quaker-affiliated Friends Academy in Locust Valley, L.I., died on Sept. 29 at his home in Brunswick, Me. He was 71.
The cause of death was a malignant melanoma, the school said. 
 During Mr. Withington's years at the academy, he saw the campus and enrollment nearly double, and the school, founded in 1876, now has 85 teachers and 685 pupils. The academy also became religiously, racially and economically more diversified under his stewardship.
Mr. Withington, a native of Winchester, Mass., spent a year after high school graduation at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, during which he set a New England preparatory-school record in the 440-yard dash in 1941. He attended Harvard College, then entered the Army Air Corps in 1943. Based in Italy as a B-24 bomber pilot, he flew 24 missions, was shot down twice and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with three clusters.
 
Teacher and Coach
 Returning to Harvard, he again excelled in track. After graduating in 1947, he became a mathematics teacher and coach at Governor Drummer Academy in Massachusetts and earned a master's in English at Middlebury College in Vermont.
He then served as principal of the Upper School at Sidwell Friends School in Washington and later as headmaster of Morgan Park Academy in Chicago before moving to Friends Academy.
Mr. Withington, known as Ted, retired to Maine in 1988. His book, "Flight to Black Hammer" (Biddle Publishing, 1993), tells of his war experiences through his letters and diaries.
He is survived by his wife, JoAnn Souter Witherington; three daughters, Susan Withington Meyn of Topsham, Me., Ann Withington of Gorham, Me., and Sarah Withington of Concord, Mass; two brothers, Dr. William A. of Lexington, Ky., and Arthur of Clinton, N.Y., and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Is Strong After Treaty Is Backed by German Court

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against other leading currencies yesterday, while the German mark remained strong.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5940 marks, down from 1.6041 marks on Monday.
Currency traders focused their attention on the mark after Germany's constitutional court gave its approval to the Maastricht Treaty, the framework for Europe's political and economic union. 
 With the court ruling, Germany becomes the final European country to approve the treaty, which calls for creating a single currency by 1999.
"In recent days there was concern that it would be a negative vote, and people started buying marks," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
But when the vote was announced, traders took profits in the mark, briefly driving the currency lower. Shortly thereafter, the German currency resumed its upward path.
 
Dollar Off vs. Yen
 The dollar dropped to 106.02 Japanese yen in late New York trading, from 106.22 yen on Monday. The British pound rose to $1.5330, from $1.5319 on Monday. The currency markets were more active yesterday than on Monday, when trading was limited because banks in New York and Tokyo had closed for national holidays.
Analysts said traders remained disappointed with the American nonfarm payroll numbers in the September employment report, which the Labor Department released on Friday.
Kevin Lawrie, a vice president with the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said traders were awaiting fresh economic data, particularly the merchandise trade report to be released on Friday.
The market is also bracing for tomorrow's report on producer prices in September and Friday's report on consumer prices.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.3985 Swiss francs, down from 1.4080; 5.6005 French francs, down from 5.6330; 1,572.30 Italian lire, down from 1,585.00, and 1.3295 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3300.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORP. (N)

 BODY:
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation said yesterday that weakness in its operating businesses led to a decline in revenues in the third quarter, but it said it was making progress in selling the assets of its failed finance subsidiary and paying off debt.
Debt was cut $500 million in the period and was at $5.9 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $8.4 billion at the beginning of the year. The company said asset sales had allowed it to pay back $765 million of revolving credit borrowings. 
 Westinghouse said the economic slowdown in California had affected its broadcasting and home building segments and reduced demand for hazardous waste disposal, which depressed the environmental unit.
The company said its operating profit margin in the quarter was 6.9 percent, down from 9.4 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Prices Surge on Hopes Of Better Economic Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Gold prices surged yesterday as big commodity funds showed renewed interest in the metal.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, jumped $7.50, to $369.20 an ounce, after trading as high as $370. Silver rose, with the December contract gaining 11 cents, to $4.44 an ounce. 
 Traders said expectations of improved economic growth also contributed to the market's perception that gold might be due for a rebound.
"People saw prices as cheap," said Jon Nadler, the head of precious metals trading with Bank of America in New York. "That was the catalyst, and the anticipation that this time, the inflation report might help, instead of hurting prices."
Since early August, gold prices have plunged from their three-year highs of more than $410 an ounce amid expectations that economic weakness would keep inflation low.
Tomorrow the Labor Department is scheduled to report on producer prices in September. But some traders are expecting a rise of only one-tenth of a percent.
 
Commodity Funds Big Buyers
 Price movements and other technical factors also contributed to the run-up in gold yesterday. Traders said commodity funds bought large amounts of gold after prices rose above $363 an ounce.
Exaggerating the move was the relatively small size of the gold market. The value of all the outstanding contracts for gold is only about $4.8 billion. By contrast, the value of the shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange is nearly a thousand times that, or roughly $4.4 trillion.
"The gold market is fairly small," said Michael Martin, an analyst and trader with the Sinclair Group in New York. "It's not that fluid a market, and it is subject a lot to these trading patterns."
On other commodity markets, wheat futures rallied to an 11-week high. On the Chicago Board of Trade, December wheat rose 4.75 cents, to $3.2675 a bushel. But December corn slipped a quarter-cent, to $2.4425 a bushel. And November soybeans were unchanged at $6.1475 a bushel.
 
Crop Estimates Smaller
 After the close of the market, the Agriculture Department estimated this year's crop at 2.422 billion bushels, which was smaller than expected. The department also estimated the corn and soybean crops below previous projections, with corn totaling 6.962 billion bushels and soybeans totaling 1.891 billion bushels.
Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, rice surged to a two-year high, gaining its maximum daily limit. November rice closed at $8.49 a hundredweight, up 45 cents. Rice has soared $2.29, or 37 percent, since Sept. 24.
After the close, the Agriculture Department projected a 5.77-million-ton decline in world rice production.

DATELINE: The Pop Life

 BODY:

New Material Girl
Remember Madonna? The entrepreneur, book subject, actress and singer recently seemed to be slipping out of her dominant position in the pop world; not too many public spats, financial or physical disclosures or new records, books or movies.
But if anybody was wondering if the Material Girl still had any drawing power, her three shows this week at Madison Square Garden, boasting a top ticket price of $75, sold out in less than an hour, and that's with only some radio promotion and a Madison Square Garden advertisement in The New York Times. Given that her last record, "Erotica," was a commercial disappointment, that's not bad. Even if her celebrity is based more on the creation of a self-image than on musical virtuosity, her reputation as a ferocious live performer clearly precedes her. 
 At least 60,000 people will see her shows on Thursday, Friday and Sunday, which means lots of security. Midtown South, the police precinct that covers Madison Square Garden, is sending about 150 police officers, including a dozen mounted police and 15 more on motorcycles, to make sure things don't get out of hand. Madonna has two personal bodyguards, plus a handful more for general tour security.
Here's what the audience will see, and hear. Madonna will appear in many changes of clothes, made by the Italian designers Dolce and Gabbana. There will be nine musicians, including two back-up singers, and eight dancers, half of them men and half women. During the two-hour show Madonna will perform everything from "Like a Virgin" to "Erotica." She (or Memorex) will sing 16 songs and dance a lot. Her audience, which comes for the sheer spectacle of it all and never seems to care much whether she's really singing or not, will adore every move.
 
A Perspective on Jazz
 The drummer Arthur Taylor's "Notes and Tones" has just been released again, this time by Da Capo Press, and it's just as revelatory as it was when it first came out in 1977. Mr. Taylor, who has been and continues to be, one of jazz's top drummers, spent some 10 years interviewing musicians with whom he'd worked, or knew. This version of the book includes a previously unpublished interview with Dexter Gordon, along with interviews with Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Art Blakey, Ornette Coleman, Dizzy Gillespie and others. It's unlike anything that has been published in jazz, with as many different opinions as interviews.
As a musician himself, Mr. Taylor had special access to his subjects. They were his friends, and like them, he is black. The pieces are by and large more candid about the state of race and jazz esthetics than most jazz books.
"The musicians were probably a little freer with me than with other people," Mr. Taylor said recently. "They had no fears or qualms talking to me, they'd speak to me like an equal because I had made music with them, and hung out with them socially. So it was easy to get them to speak their minds."
When it first appeared, the book was enormously controversial. The interviews were done after the civil-rights movement had all but collapsed, and there's a sense of bitterness and frustration that prevails in some of the interviews.
Here, for instance, is the saxophonist Johnny Griffin talking in 1969 about the life of an expatriate jazz player in Europe: "Black musicians all over Europe running away from America. But that's part of the white power structure that's killing us and our music."
Mr. Taylor said the initial response to the book was "tremendously negative."
"White people complained because I didn't include any white musicians. Jews were upset about what some musicians said about them. And black people said I was giving up too much information about how we think. Everybody was down on me."
But Mr. Taylor has persevered. Not only has he collected enough interviews for another book -- taken in part from his interview show on WKCR, Columbia University's radio station -- but he's also leading one of jazz's best groups, Taylor's Wailers.
"I'm getting a fantastic response to the book this time out," Mr. Taylor said. "I think people have kind of moderated their views, but like I say in the new introduction, some things haven't changed. Thelonious Monk said he couldn't get a cab up to Harlem, and you still can't get cabs to drive up there."
 
Big Apple Grammys
 The Grammys are coming back to New York on March 1, and New York is looking for the payoff. The New York City Host Committee for the 1994 Grammy Awards, which more or less manages the proceedings, is trying to stretch the festivities connected with the show out over a week, and make it a tourist event. Anybody wondering why should look at the money involved: the committee says the Grammys will generate approximately $40 million for the city.
"A tremendous amount of revenue is generated by all the visitors, who'll be going to restaurants, night clubs, Broadway theaters, and using taxis," said Jonathan Tisch, the chairman of the committee. "And a tremendous amount of revenue is spent by record companies looking to entertain. It's a real boost to the economy."
Every year, Los Angeles and New York compete for the awards, upping the ante to play host. Next year the committee will have photo exhibits open to the public, and plans to broadcast the show in Times Square on the Sony Jumbotron, among other things. Most importantly, several record companies will pay for some programs dear to the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, or Naras, the organization that puts on the Grammys.
"I know Los Angeles was upset to lose the Grammys for next year," Mr. Tisch said. "We spent a lot of time working on this, and I'm glad it's going to happen. We guaranteed a couple of programs important to Naras, like the Grammy in the School program. Things like that helped us get the Grammys. People are really excited about it."

A New Thatcher Watch
Special to The New York Times
 LONDON, Oct. 12 -- The memoirs of Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister, aren't scheduled to reach bookstores here until Monday. But they have already caused a considerable fuss, because of a combination of clever marketing, London's vicious newspaper wars and Britain's continued obsession with a political leader who, even out of office, has managed to keep herself solidly in the public eye. 
 The book, "The Downing Street Years," is being published by HarperCollins U.K., which reportedly paid the enormous sum of 3.5 million (about $5.4 million) for it and a yet-to-come companion volume that is to detail Mrs. Thatcher's early career and rise to power. The publisher has printed 250,000 copies of "The Downing Street Years," and has timed its release to take place in the midst of a five-part serialization here in The Sunday Times (both HarperCollins and The Sunday Times are owned by Rupert Murdoch).
 
Beaten to the Punch
 A rival newspaper, The Daily Mirror, stole some of the thunder last week by printing the most scandalous excerpts it could find, which showed Mrs. Thatcher criticizing members of her own party in intensely unflattering terms. But The Sunday Times went ahead this week with its first installment, and booksellers say the competition of excerpts may actually have helped the publishing hype.
"I think the unauthorized quotes in The Daily Mirror would have created enormous interest and that many people feel these quotations might have been taken out of context, and will be interested in reading the book," said Alan Giles, the managing director of Waterstones Booksellers, Britain's largest specialty bookstore chain, which has ordered 21,000 copies for its 90 stores.
Mr. Giles predicted "The Downing Street Years" would be a big best seller in Britain. He explained that political memoirs from the Thatcher era have been doing particularly well, even if the people who buy the books don't necessarily read them. "They're like exercise cycles: people buy them with enormously good intentions and put them away and never use them," he said.
How the book fares here probably won't have much bearing on how it does in the United States, where its publisher is HarperCollins and where it is to appear in stores on Monday. The memoirs of past American presidents haven't always been so successful, in some cases bombing outright.
 
A Shorter Attention Span?
 Britain and the United States have always enjoyed a warm publishing relationship and, indeed, many editors in the two countries are friendly and tend to publish one another's books. But it seems that trade between the two countries is now more one way than the other, with the British buying more American books than Americans buying British ones.
But if the disparity between what is imported from across the Atlantic and what is exported is noticeable here, it is even sharper in other countries, where publishers lap up American books but seem to have an excruciatingly hard time selling their own authors to United States houses. The reasons for this include American readers' apparent preference for home-grown authors, a decreasing number of American editors who know how to read languages other than English, and American publishers' reluctance, in a lingering recession, to gamble on fiction that is likely to bring in little in return.
Foreign publishers' frustration was all too apparent at the Frankfurt Book Fair, which ended on Monday.
"I don't think there are so many books coming from Germany that many Americans want to read," said Hans Ewald Dede, a prominent German publisher. "For one thing, there are only a very few German writers who can write highly entertaining novels; they are perhaps too didactic, too interested in teaching."
 
And Then There's Bulgaria
 German publishers like Mr. Ewald are at least well known to their American counterparts. Many foreigners from countries where publishing is less international have an even harder time. "Offering Bulgarian books to be published abroad is a very, very difficult phenomenon," said Katalina Sabeva, who runs the Anthea literary agency in Bulgaria. "We're interesting as an exotic country to the Americans, but our modern culture is difficult for modern Americans to understand."
Sander Knol, an editor at Der Boekerij, a Dutch publisher, said rather sadly that "Holland authors cannot travel." But American authors obviously can: Der Boekerij has a list 90 percent of which is foreign translations, most of them American, and is publishing Amy Fisher's memoir, for instance. "I think the story has elements that will appeal to many people," Mr. Knol said.
 
The Lannan Prizes
 The Lannan Foundation, a private arts organization in Los Angeles, has announced its annual literary prizes, given to "accomplished writers who have made significant contributions to English-language literature" and to "writers of distinctive merit who demonstrate potential for outstanding future work." This year, the prizes, worth $50,000 each, were awarded to 10 authors:

Fiction Award: Paul West
Poetry Award: Denise Levertov
Nonfiction Award: Edward Hoagland

HEADLINE: How to Get Tough With Haiti

 BODY:
The thugs who prevented U.S. and Canadian troops from landing in Haiti on Monday do not represent the majority of the Haitian people. The country's voters made their choice three years ago when they elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide with a 65 percent majority. The military elite, accustomed to unquestioned power, drove him into exile. Now that elite, aided by its paramilitary "attaches," is invoking nationalist pride and characterizing the U.N. mission to restore President Aristide as a foreign invasion.
The attaches, who prevented a U.S. troopship from landing and threatened the U.S. charge d'affaires on Monday, kept at it yesterday by menacing a television crew with machine guns and preventing children from attending school. 
 The junta clearly has no intention of following the agreement reached in July on Governors Island in New York City, which created a timetable for returning President Aristide to power. The thwarted mission was supposed to be a part of that process, helping to "professionalize" the military and separate it from the police force.
In accordance with the Governors Island agreement, economic sanctions against Haiti were lifted in August. It was those sanctions -- fully supported by Haiti's poor majority, despite the pain it caused them -- that finally forced the recalcitrant military, led by Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, to the bargaining table. But General Cedras and his cronies have demonstrated in the past few days that they have no intention of giving up power.
While nominally accepting the U.N.'s conditions to get the sanctions lifted, General Cedras has obviously been sending quite another message to the troops at home, encouraging them to believe they can stop democracy through intimidation.
Now it's time to get serious with the Haitian junta. Since the Governors Island agreement has clearly been broken, the economic sanctions should be reimposed -- and strengthened. General Cedras should be given a very short deadline -- 24 to 48 hours -- to get his followers under control.
President Clinton has belatedly but correctly recognized that the U.N. mission, in its recent form and under the present hostile circumstances, would not work. He has ordered a temporary halt to the mission. Now Mr. Clinton can tell General Cedras that he must give up power to the democratically elected Government, as agreed, or face a naval blockade and cessation of all commercial air traffic and financial transactions -- in other words, complete isolation from the international community.
Only when the United Nations joined in the Western Hemisphere's embargo, cutting off its oil supply from Europe, did Haiti's ruling elite feel enough pain to start talking about handing over power. It's clear they now need another sharp reminder that complete disregard for the will of their own people will carry a heavy price.

HEADLINE: Ex-Detroit Officers Ordered To Prison for Beating Death

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Two white former police officers convicted of beating a black motorist to death outside a crack house were sentenced to prison today by a judge who told the courtroom, "I know nobody in the community will be completely satisfied with what has transpired here today."
Judge George W. Crockett 3d sentenced one former officer, Larry Nevers, 53, to 12 to 25 years in prison. The other, Walter Budzyn, 47, received a sentence of 8 to 18 years for the beating death of Malice Green last Nov. 5. 
 Under Michigan law, Mr. Budzyn will have to serve at least six and a half years in prison; Mr. Nevers will serve a minimum of nine years and eight months, a prison spokesman said.
Judge Crockett said he had asked the Federal prison system to allow the former officers to serve their sentences there, presumably in another state. Lawyers for the former officers had asked that they serve their time out of state because, as longtime street patrolmen, they would be among many convicts they had helped to send to prison.
 
'Excessive in the Extreme'
 While Judge Crockett told Mr. Budzyn, who served 19 years on the Detroit police force, that he did not believe the former officer's assertion that he did not strike the victim, he added, "I don't think you should be treated as a person who wanted to kill someone."
But he said he could not quarrel with the jury's verdict of second-degree murder. By failing to stop the beating, the judge said, Mr. Budzyn subjected the victim to "the risk of great bodily harm."
The judge had harsher words for Mr. Nevers, who was a Detroit police officer for 24 years. "Yours were the blows that resulted in the death of Malice Green, in all probability, from the evidence I have heard," he said. There was a murmur in the courtroom as the judge went on: "I don't believe you intended to kill Malice Green. I believe you intended to do harm, and serious harm. What you did was excessive in the extreme."
The two former officers were convicted of second-degree murder by separate juries on Aug. 23 after a trial that was closely followed through the summer here. They were dismissed from the police force after the incident.
 
Starts With Drug Arrest
 Testimony at the trial indicated that the officers suspected that Mr. Green, a 35-year-old unemployed steel worker with a history of drug problems, possessed crack when they confronted him while he was sitting in his car outside a known crack house. Witnesses said the officers beat him with heavy metal flashlights when he failed to follow orders to open his hand. A medical examiner testified that Mr. Green had died from more than a dozen blows to the head.
While there was never any testimony that race was a factor in the beating, there were concerns that a not-guilty verdict or lenient sentences might have touched off the kind of civil disturbance that rocked Los Angeles after four police officers there were acquitted on state charges in the beating death of Rodney G. King after a car chase.
Today, the sentences were calmly accepted in this city. "Justice has been served," said Wendell Anthony, president of the Detroit chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Several white Detroit police officers, all of whom declined to identify themselves, said they were not surprised by the sentences, which they said were too harsh.
Outside the court, there were some signs of dissatisfaction as about 50 Green family supporters and a similar-sized group of supporters of the former police officers shouted taunts and slogans at each other.
 
Appeals Are Planned
 The request that the officers serve their sentences in a Federal prison is "not all that unusual," said Warren Williams, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections. He noted that 28 Michigan prisoners are currently serving state sentences in Federal prisons, in most cases because of concern for their safety.
So far, Judge Crockett said during sentencing, the Federal Bureau of Prisons has not responded to his request. In the meantime, Mr. Nevers and Mr. Budzyn will be housed in a special protective custody unit at an undisclosed Michigan prison.
"I'm sure there is every likelihood that they will agree," Mr. Williams said. "It could take two to four weeks to get a response."
The former officers' lawyers immediately said they would appeal the convictions. Earlier, Mr. Budzyn's lawyer, John Goldpaugh, had sought a mistrial on the ground that the jurors were shown the movie "Malcolm X" during the trial, a film that begins with the videotape of Mr. King's beating. And a juror in the trial of Mr. Budzyn, identified only as Karl, wrote to Judge Crockett and told news organizations that he had been pressured into the verdict and wished he could change his mind.

HEADLINE: BELL ATLANTIC DEAL FOR 2 CABLE GIANTS PUT AT $33 BILLION

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
In what is shaping up as the largest corporate merger in history, the Bell Atlantic Corporation has agreed to buy both Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable operator, and its cable programming company, the Liberty Media Corporation, in an all-stock deal valued at more than $23 billion, three executives close to the negotiations said last night.
With the assumption of $10 billion in debt, the total value of the deal would be $33 billion. 
 The corporate marriage, which is expected to be announced this morning, would be one of the first to take advantage of a regulatory environment that has become more hospitable to telephone companies' branching into new businesses as a way to bring about a nationwide "superhighway" communications network that would carry voice, video and computer data.
 
 
Well-Positioned Company
 Assuming regulators do not frown on the deal, the merged company would be well positioned to explore and develop new technology for delivering an arsenal of innovative programming into American homes. But its sheer size is bound to attract intense scrutiny from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.
The new company would have access to 42 percent of American homes, a figure that reflects the extraordinary reach of both Tele-Communications, which controls 25 percent of the United States cable television market, and Bell Atlantic, which is based in Philadelphia and provides telephone service for the Middle Atlantic states.
The merger would also create a colossal company with $60 billion in assets and more than $16 billion in revenues. Ranked by assets alone, it would deserve to be showcased as the sixth largest company in Fortune 500's annual list of largest American companies, ahead of Philip Morris and Chrysler, and overshadowed only by General Electric, General Motors, Ford Motor, International Business Machines and Exxon in that order.
The size and scope of the deal stunned the industry last night, and even people involved in the deal were at a loss for words. While telephone companies have begun buying smaller cable companies, it had hardly seemed possible that a telephone company would try to swallow a major cable operator whole.
Nor had there been any clue -- despite enormous scrutiny in the last few weeks because of Tele-Communications' role in the takeover battle for Paramount Communications -- that Tele-Communications' president, John C. Malone, intended to sell his company.
Just last week, he seemed far more intent to play the buyer, arranging to buy back the 90 percent of Liberty Media that Tele-Communications did not already own. Now, it seems that the Liberty buyback may have been motivated by the Bell Atlantic deal, since consolidating the ownership of Tele-Communications and Liberty should vastly simplify the telephone company's task.
Mr. Malone has flirted with various phone companies before, but never on this magnitude. He did a number of small deals with telephone companies including U S West and has apparently been in talks over the past several months to sell at least an interest in Tele-Communications to one of the phone companies.
Far from killing a bid for Paramount that Bell Atlantic was considering joining, experts said that the latest purchase might actually strengthen that bid, which also involves QVC Network Inc. The reason is that Liberty would be that much stronger with Bell Atlantic's financial power behind it. And one expert said he believed that Bell Atlantic could buy another movie company if it chose to do so if Paramount merged instead with Viacom Inc., its handpicked merger partner, or if the deal simply fell through.
Bell Atlantic's entry into Mr. Malone's orbit and therefore into the Paramount deal, however, may put on ice plans that QVC's chairman, Barry Diller, had been making. He had been seriously exploring an investment by BellSouth that would have helped him increase his $9.5 billion bid for Paramount if necessary. But now it is far from clear whether BellSouth would care to invest in QVC, if that company is owned in part by Bell Atlantic, one of its biggest rivals. Liberty Media is the largest shareholder in QVC.
For Bell Atlantic's part, it has been among the most aggressive of the phone companies in diversifying into new areas. Clearly, it is gambling that it will not have to deal for long with current American law that bars telephone companies from owning cable systems in their own territory. Bell Atlantic has already won a district court ruling in Virginia declaring the law that prohibits such cross-ownership as unconstitutional, but the case is being appealed.
 
 
Political Sentiment
 Even so, time is on Bell Atlantic's side. The political sentiment in Washington and the Clinton Administration is shifting rapidly to eliminate legal barriers for consumers' sake because telephone companies are seen as a good way to force competition into the cable market.
Several people close to the talks said last night that Bell Atlantic would pay about $35 a share of its own stock for each share in Tele-Communications, after it absorbs the shares of Liberty it does not already own. Those shares will pay no dividends for five years to conserve cash. Bell Atlantic also intends to assume the roughly $10 billion in debt that Tele-Communications already carries, they added.
Counting the absorption of $10 billion in debt, the deal weighs in at about $33 billion and therefore should easily rank ahead of RJR Nabisco's 1989 leveraged buyout, which at the time involved $25 billion in equity and $4.5 billion in debt.
Though the deal's total value is enormous, the price is in line with other media deals, bankers say. Bell Atlantic appears to be paying close to 12 times recent cash flow, what comparable deals usually fetch. The deal should be tax-free to Tele-Communications and Liberty shareholders who hold on to their newly issued Bell Atlantic stock.
Bell Atlantic refused to comment yesterday. It released a statement that said it would make a major announcement in New York at 7:30 this morning, followed by a news conference at 10.
Bell Atlantic is investing heavily in fiber optic and advanced digital switching technology, which will allow it to deliver a sophisticated network that has the theoretical capability to let people order whatever video entertainment they might want.
The company is already installing that technology throughout New Jersey and in a showcase system in Virginia. What Tele-Communications brings is a rich source of programming through Liberty and its cable networks, which already deliver dozens of programming channels.
The nation's telephone systems have the ability to provide two-way communications, but telephone wires running into individual homes do not have the capacity for more than a single channel of video at one time. By contrast, a cable operator such as Tele-Communications offers networks that bring lots of channels into the home. Its big drawback is that it offers little ability to send information back to the supplier, which is the base of any two-way programming service such as movies-on-demand.
 
 
'Have to Be a Fool'
 "You would have to be a fool not to figure that the telephone companies have figured out that the broadband networks owned by cable companies are going to be tremendous strategic assets in the next decade," said Gordon Crawford, a senior vice president of Capital Research, the largest shareholder of Liberty Media and Tele-Communications.
Mr. Malone and his mentor, Bob Magness, Tele-Communications' chairman, stand to do extremely well under the deal. They will each get a premium for their class B voting stock in each company. And they will get to name five directors out of the 15 who will serve on the combined company's board. One person close to the deal said that he believed that Mr. Malone will assume the vice chairman's title behind Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond W. Smith.
Mr. Malone's 1991 reorganization of his cable empire already made him one of the richest men in America. Now, with the buyout by Bell Atlantic, his fortune would continue to soar.

HEADLINE: Haiti Army Celebrates U.S. Withdrawal

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 12

 BODY:
To the accompaniment of 15 minutes of jubilant dancing, cheering and gunfire, a United States troop ship pulled out of Haitian waters this afternoon after two days anchored under the baking sun a mile from port.
A demonstration organized by security forces opposed to the return of Haiti's deposed President prevented the 560-foot Harlan County, carrying more than 200 soldiers, from docking on Monday. Today it headed to the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
 The troops are part of a 1,300-member United Nations contingent set up under the settlement in July that calls for restoring the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the presidency.
 
Dockside Under Siege
 Demonstrators surrounded the port with roadblocks today, and cars venturing near the area were stopped and searched, or scared off with gunfire. Members of an American television crew who drove into the area were briefly arrested and threatened with execution, but were later released.
Diplomats said the forces manning the roadblocks and building barricades were police auxiliaries, who have been blamed for much of the recent violence here, and regular soldiers. The Army, led by Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, accounts for about 7,000 troops, including 1,500 police officers led by Col. Joseph Michel Francois.
Colonel Francois is widely suspected of having organized a similar number of auxiliaries, known as attaches, who rove the streets heavily armed.
Diplomats said the armed forces threatened the efforts to restore democracy. Father Aristide was ousted by security forces two years ago.
 
General Under Duress
 Diplomats are divided on whether to expect General Cedras to retire, as he is supposed to do Friday. Even if he retires, many warn, other members of the high command, working in league with Colonel Francois, are likely to balk at carrying out the settlement.
In a three-hour meeting here with two United States Congressmen, General Cedras refused to guarantee protection for United States forces sent to Haiti under United Nations mandate.
The mandate calls for the 1,300 soldiers and police officers to separate Haiti's police force from the army, and to retrain both forces.
A Canadian diplomat here said his nation's small police contingent already in Haiti was "staying put and staying calm." The diplomat, who insisted on anonymity, was surprised that the Harlan County, which is carrying 175 United States troops and 25 Canadians, had turned back. "Can anyone explain to me why Washington has just done this?" he asked. "We learned of it on CNN, and just about everyone is shocked."
 
Few U.N. Troops Under Arms
 The United Nations force is to be lightly armed, with only a few members carrying pistols. Diplomats and military officials say there is no way to bring in the troops without a secure environment and a clear commitment from the Haitian Army.
The two Congressmen, Senator Bob Graham and Representative Alcee L. Hastings, both Democrats of Florida, said such a commitment was rejected by General Cedras, who argued that protecting the forces was the job of the transitional civilian Government, which was appointed six weeks ago.
"Quite frankly, his answers amounted to obfuscation," Mr. Hastings said. "It seems that they are looking for any excuse to make the accords collapse."
The civilian Government, led by Prime Minister Robert Malval, also faces a refusal by the military to cooperate and threats of violence by the attaches.
 
People Under Threat
 In recent weeks, crowded neighborhoods have become the scene of nightly raids by roving bands of men spraying automatic-weapons fire.
In another incident today, international human rights observers in a provincial town, Hinche, were threatened by a mob of 300 protesters. Although no one was hurt, the mob smashed a United Nations vehicle.
"We are extremely concerned at the moment for the safety of our observers," said Colin Granderson, the head of a joint mission by the United Nations and the Organization of American States that has been monitoring human rights since February.
The lack of a prompt response to the defiance by Haiti's military has brought a mood of despondency to many of the diplomats here. Dante Caputo, the special United Nations envoy, speaking at a reception Monday, said of possible new trade sanctions: "I don't think they are the best way to restore democracy, but they may be the last tool we have."
Another senior diplomat said: "The international community has run out of initiatives. The Haitians have run circles around us, and people are only just now realizing how truly evil the people we are dealing with are."
 
Goverment Under a Cloud
 Members of Mr. Malval's Government say that given the international community's recoil from crises in Somalia and Bosnia, they see little chance of armed intervention here to unseat the military.
"They are talking about sanctions, but that is an abstract measure for people like this," said one senior adviser to Mr. Malval. "We are looking at just three days of life left in the agreement here. After that, all bets are off."
The upswing in violence also prevented a vote today by members of Parliament on a law separating the police and the army. The elected members walked out when politicians opposed to President Aristide who were elected fraudulently last January and later purged under international pressure returned to their seats, accompanied by uniformed police with rifles.
"We are going back into the Parliament," said Dejean Belizaire, one of the purged senators. "The accord has been violated by the Government."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 16, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A brief background summary on Wednesday, headed "Haiti at a Glance," included incorrect dates in some editions for the country's independence and for the election of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President. Independence was in 1804, not 1934. Father Aristide was elected in December 1990; February 1991 was the date of his inauguration.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Haiti at a Glance"
 
HISTORY: Haiti was a French colony from 1659 until 1804, when black slaves declared independence. Instability throughout the 19th century finally led the U.S. to take military control from 1915 to 1934. Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier became President in 1957. Jean-Claude, his 19-year-old son, took over in 1971 and opened the country to developement until he fled in 1986. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, elected in February 1991, was ousted in a military coup in Spetember 1991. After an oil and arms embargo, an agreement was reached in July to reinstate Father Aristide at the end of this month. But the plan is in doubt because American and Canadian peacekeepers were not allowed to land.
 
GOVERNMENT: The Government is based on a popularly elected President and a Parliament with two houses. But it has been a military dictatorship since Father Aristide's outster.
 
ECONOMY: The country is one of the poorest and most populous of the West Indies. Haiti relies on agriculture, primarily coffee, sugar, and cotton. Coffee is also its largest export.
 
POPULATION: 6,431,000
 
RACE: Black 95% and mixed race 5%
 
LANGUAGE: French and Haitian Creole, though Creole is predominant.
 
RELIGION: Roman Catholic. Voodoo is the folk religion.

HEADLINE: Choke Haiti's Thugs

BYLINE: By Amy Wilentz; Amy Wilentz is author of "The Rainy Season: Haiti Since Duvalier."

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
The television footage out of Haiti is like a scene from a recurring nightmare: the brandished weapons, the ugly insults, the violent attacks on bystanders. The Haitian military and its "attaches," descendants of the Duvalier regime's infamous Tontons Macoutes, love to beat up the weak, the downtrodden, the unarmed -- anyone who threatens to come between them and their booty.
The latest object of their ire is the amphibious ship Harlan County, which was supposed to unload an "observer" contingent of some 200 American and Canadian troops. Yesterday, the Pentagon ordered the ship to leave Haitian waters. 
 U.S. policy in Haiti has been so indecisive since the 1991 coup overthrowing President Jean-Bertrand Aristide that it seems almost reasonable that a few dozen thugs can force the army of the world's sole remaining superpower into retreat.
Under George Bush, the U.S. said it supported democracy in Haiti but did not give 100 percent backing to President Aristide, who was overwhelmingly elected in Haiti's first free and fair balloting. The U.S. then supported a halfhearted embargo against the de facto military regime, one that was so porous that oil and other necessities flowed freely into the island.
When the United Nations, with full support of the new Clinton Administration, finally levied serious sanctions against the regime, the U.S. helped broker an agreement on Governors Island this summer that lifted the new embargo far too soon, against the better judgment of the Aristide administration.
If Haiti's brief democratic experiment is to continue, the U.S. must once and for all have a consistent policy there.
The U.S. has to push hard for the immediate reimposition of U.N. sanctions. We should insure that the Government of the neighboring Dominican Republic understands that harsh penalties will be imposed on its vital sugar trade if it allows goods to leak across the border it shares with Haiti, as has happened in the past. (Of course, since sanctions were lifted, the Haitian military has reportedly stockpiled enough oil to last six months to a year.)
The U.S. and its allies should enclose the island with a naval blockade. This way, small ships carrying contraband, from which the generals and their men have made hundreds of thousands of dollars during the various embargoes since the coup, will not be able to get in. Also, a naval blockade will show that we are dead serious.
The U.S. and its allies should also revoke the visas and freeze all assets of those individuals -- perhaps 200 officers and the industrialists who bankrolled them -- who were involved in the coup and its bloody aftermath. We know who they are.
It's just possible that Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who has presided over the whole brutal mess, will actually step down, as mandated in the accord. If he does abide by the agreement, President Aristide would then name a new head for the Haitian army, whose first great test would be to get rid of the rogue police chief Michel Joseph Francois, an instigator of the riots on Monday as well as the terror campaign of the last year. He has vowed to remain at his post.
In any event, the U.S. should insure that reimposed sanctions are not lifted until all the officers involved in the bloody assaults and assassinations have given up power and are in exile. The democratic government also needs to be back in place with new officers and new chiefs of staff, appointed by President Aristide.
If these prescriptions sound like a scratched record, it is only because the Governors Island accord planned its own failure by lifting sanctions before they had achieved these goals. One can only wonder why.

The Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc. announced the biggest media merger in history yesterday, a deal offering perhaps the clearest evidence yet that American industry is serious about building the vaunted "information superhighway" of the future.
In announcing the $33 billion deal, the cable industry entrepreneur John C. Malone held out the vision of a single powerful box on top of each home television set that would combine the diverse streams of information that now flow separately into the home: telephone calls, television shows, video rentals, newspapers and even books. 
 If the vaunted information superhighway is coming, this set-top device will be the steering wheel, combining the video controls of a cable converter box, the two-way capabilities of a telephone and the information-processing power of a personal computer. In short, "it will allow us to control all the communications needs of a household with one device," Mr. Malone said.
Although there is no guarantee that consumers will buy the services that Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications envision, the companies are among many big media players that see advantages in combining the capabilities of cable and telephone networks.
Currently, cable networks have the capacity to carry hundreds of channels of television programs or other information, but most cable systems are not very good at letting consumers send information back over the network, whether to order a movie or play video games with other cable customers.
 
Predicting a Transformation
 Telephone "channels," by contrast, can handle only limited amounts of information, but they have an almost magical ability through switching systems to let anyone on the network communicate with anyone else.
Therein lies the promise of this mega-merger, which will blend the information cargo-carrying capacity of the nation's largest cable company and the traffic-control talents of one of America's most technically sophisticated telephone companies.
"This is going to forever change our lives and rearrange the whole computer and the communications industries," said Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of Oracle, a Redwood City, Calif., software company. Oracle is designing software systems for storing and retrieving video and data from vast information libraries that will be available to American consumers.
More than any of the hundreds of information-age alliances that have been proposed to date, a merger of Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications clearly outlines the potential of a national data highway.
"When video and voice and everything else is all digital, there are economies that can be achieved by offering all of the information over a unified medium," said John Moussouris, a Silicon Valley computer designer.
By blending telephone and television networks, Mr. Malone and Raymond Smith, the chairman of Bell Atlantic, may help ignite an explosion of new information services that will go far beyond the conventional ideas of ordering videos on demand and shopping at home, the types of services that have been presumed to be the first commercially viable businesses on the digital information highway.
The truly successful new information services, some experts say, may go beyond traditional television programming and consumerism.
"It's very easy to envisage a time when video communication will be the most natural way to communicate," said Nathan Myhrvold, a senior vice president at the Microsoft Corporation, who is in charge of developing the software company's interactive television business.
What will be possible when "video dial tone" is widely available in every American home? For one thing, some industry executives predict, there will be a proliferation of video cameras throughout society, permitting people to dial into the network and peek virtually everywhere.
For example, before leaving for work in the morning, commuters might be able to dial up the camera that is pointing at the freeway on-ramp or at that frequently troublesome overpass to see instantly if there is a traffic jam. Indeed, such cameras scattered along the entire route would make it possible to virtually "drive" to work before leaving home -- or stay there, if things look truly grim.
"Dialing" itself, in fact, is likely to be a vastly different experience when such services arrive in the next century. Rather than pecking at numbers on a telephone keypad, it is likely that a telephone caller will simply use a remote control to point at an icon on the television screen. The call might be audio only, or it could include full-motion video, if the two -- or more -- parties agree.
Whatever new services ultimately arrive on the information superhighway, yesterday's merger announcement was seen by many computer and communications industry executives as the clearest evidence yet that the convergence of digital information media is really occurring.
"This is not a conventional merger in any sense," said James Moore, president of Geopartners, a Cambridge, Mass. consulting firm. "It's all about coming together to build the next generation of technology and services."
If the synergy between cable and telephone is real, some believe it will shift the center of technology innovation away from the personal computer business. Mr. Ellison, Oracle's chairman, in particular argues that growth in the future will not be in stand-alone personal computers, but instead in the television set-top boxes and in hand-held information and communications devices that will connect wirelessly to the information highway.
Mr. Ellison is also betting that there will be a boom in demand for supercomputers, which will act as the information servers for the powerful new networks. These machines will provide the raw computing horsepower to deliver simultaneously thousands of movies or other items from electronic data bases.
Despite the promise of the nation's most ambitious technology merger yet, there are also obvious caveats. To date, most of the high-technology experiments in interactive television have been disappointments, beginning with Warner Amex Cable's interactive QUBE system in Columbus, Ohio, which began in 1977 and ended a few years later without living up to expectations. And an interactive cable system that the GTE telephone company has been operating for several years in Cerritos, Calif., has yet to show it can effectively compete with video rental stores.
 
Doubts Expressed
 Histories like these cause some analysts to be pessimistic about the ambitious plans of Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications.
"John Malone is smart; he's getting out at the top," said Mark Stahlman, president of New Media Associates, a New York City consulting firm. "Cable television won't continue to grow."
As for Bell Atlantic, he said, the phone company is groping for a way to find new revenue beyond the local-telephone business, a mature industry. In cable, Mr. Stahlman said, "Bell Atlantic is turning to the obvious business and trying to use the obvious technology to squeeze the last drop of blood out of the stone."

HEADLINE: Where Hispanic Voters Sided With Dinkins, Now Defection

SERIES: Campaign Stop: A periodic report on neighborhood reaction to the mayoral race. 1. Soundview

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
With its tree-shaded streets lined with tidy brick and stucco homes, parts of Soundview look downright suburban, and for many of its residents it is. This corner of the southeast Bronx was the working-class promised land -- a house, garage and yard -- a hard-earned reward for sweating it out at work and toughing it out in the tenements of the South Bronx or Spanish Harlem.
Now, as residents prepare to vote for mayor, they grumble that the out-of-the way feeling that attracted them to the neighborhood in the first place may be its curse as New York City officials show little interest in their concerns, which range from uneven sidewalks and overgrown trees to the recent incursion of drugs and crime. All they have to do, they say, is glance at the street through barred windows and fenced-in porches and wonder if the phrase "quality of life" will ever be more than a campaign catch phrase. 
 This is the kind of community where Mr. Dinkins must run up a big vote to assure his re-election. But a visit to one neighborhood in Soundview suggests the nature of Mayor David N. Dinkins's difficulties among Hispanic voters, who supported him by a 2-to-1 ratio over Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1989 and are an important swing vote this time around. Within this neighborhood -- a 15-block census tract that is nearly half Hispanic -- there are signs that Mr. Dinkins will not garner as much support as he did four years ago when he outpolled Mr. Giuliani 982 votes to 135 votes. Whether he has lost enough support to foil his re-election bid remains to be seen.
Many say he has not lived up to their hopes. The Mayor's term has left one-time supporters like Antonio Burgos Jr. disillusioned. "I really wanted him to make it," Mr. Burgos said. "It would have been so cool. He would have opened the door for Hispanics. But the way he talked about Crown Heights and the problems with the Korean store, he messed it all up."
Many Hispanic residents said the Mayor took Hispanic votes for granted, and they expressed a keen realization that they were in a position to thwart his re-election.
Mr. Burgos, 26, a porter who said Mr. Dinkins captured his hopes and vote four years ago, plans to vote for Mr. Giuliani, not so much out of support, but rather disenchantment with Mr. Dinkins, whom he said did little but waffle on the issues and pepper his speeches with empty phrases. He suggested Mr. Giuliani would be a more effective crime fighter.
"There's a lot of little neighborhoods like this suffering from the same problems," said Mr. Burgos, who grew up in Soundview. "These are the people who work and pay taxes and they're upset because they can't have anything. What's the point of buying a house and fixing it up if you can't keep it clean and safe?"
Melissa Vega, 21, a dental assistant who lives on St. Lawrence Avenue, has heard those criticisms, but they have not deterrred her from her intention of voting for Mr. Dinkins.
"I think he's done O.K.," she said. "A lot of people criticize him, but I don't know why."
Longtime residents remember when their neighborhood was a respite from the overcrowding and crime they had tolerated in their search for a better life. Their homes, fixed up with gardens and statues, were a proud signal that they had made it, even if they had to work two jobs to finance a mortgage.
 
Crime and Drug Dealers
 Now, the talk is of crime, especially that fueled by drug dealers who ply their trade near the Soundview Houses housing project, where grafitti scrawls challenge the police and gunshots ring out at night. Last year, parishioners from Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church held prayer vigils outside of one suspected crack house on Randall Avenue. Several weeks later, intruders broke into the church, smashing statues and setting fires.
The incident brought official attention and the crack house was closed, but residents said the dealers only moved down the block, leaving them with the impression that their concerns have been forgotten.
"The city should have ways of hitting and hitting it until it's clean and they don't come back," said Catherine Oliveri, a retired city worker who has lived on Beach Avenue for 14 years. "Now, they give up. It's like a revolving door. It's a joke."
Mrs. Oliveri, a Democrat who voted for Mr. Giuliani in 1989, said she planned to do the same this year, hoping that his years as a Federal prosecutor would help bring stability to the neighborhood.
"Dinkins really never did anything with crime," she said. "Giuliani dealt with crime before. I imagine he's got better ideas. I hope he does. I feel we should give him a chance to try and do better than Dinkins."
Crimes of a lesser sort irked Mr. Burgos, who tinkered with his car one recent afternoon outside of the two-story house he shares with his wife and parents. He complained that vehicles left overnight on the street were often targeted twice, first by vandals who smash windows and steal parts and then by traffic enforcement agents who in the last year have stepped up their ticketing of illegally parked cars.
"We never had traffic patrol before," he said. "But since the city is so hard up for money, you got them giving tickets."
For others, the economy dominates their thinking. Nelson Sicardo, a 38-year-old construction laborer who is on workers' compensation after a back injury, said that despite the Mayor's policy of favoring minority companies for city contracts, workers like himself are often laid off.
"I wish he could do something about that," said Mr. Sicardo, who did not vote in 1989 but said he intended to this time. "Why should I worry about being laid off when Irish and Italians don't have to bust their butts for a paycheck because they're related to somebody. I get laid off when the work is slow. How can it be slow when a job is 80 floors and we're only on the 30th?"
He said he had not decided who would get his vote.
In a way, residents said, the election of the city's first minority mayor left them with expectations that conditions would improve for other minorities, but their experiences suggest Mr. Dinkins's talk of inclusiveness and tolerance has not filtered down through the ranks of city government. For example, Mr. Sicardo, like others his age, said he felt unfairly singled out by the police even when he passed the time with friends outside of his house, which is a block away from a thriving crack trade.
"I'll be hanging outside here and the cops tell me to get away from my corner," he said. "How can they do that? They treat me like a hoodlum because I'm Puerto Rican."
In a larger sense, there is a feeling among many Hispanic residents that Mr. Dinkins's administration has taken their loyalty for granted. They still remember slights like his denunciation of the Puerto Rican nationalists as "assassins" who shot up the Congress in the 1950's, and the disparaging comments about Hispanic immigrants made in 1990 by a supporter, Hazel Dukes, when she said, among other things, they were taking jobs away from blacks.
 
Only 'Helping His Own'
 "I don't think he's done anything for us," said Robert Felix, a 46-year-old motor mechanic. "Maybe in midtown. But when we need him on this side he did nothing. I think he only likes his own race. He's only trying to help his own."
While Mr. Felix did not vote in the last election, he said he planned to vote for Mr. Giuliani next month. "Something's got to change," he said.
His friend, Louie Alvarez, 47, a general contractor, said he thought Mr. Dinkins's favoritism was geared to the green of campaign contributions, the kind that working people like him cannot afford to dole out.
"He doesn't care about Latinos or blacks," said Mr. Alvarez, who favored Mr. Dinkins in 1989. "He only cares about white society, you know, take care of my pocket and I'll take care of you. But you know something, I don't blame him. Everybody promises so much, once you put him there, nobody can do anything."
A block away, inside an elaborately gated and decorated house, Mr. Felix's mother, Francisca, said she would simply like the city to cut the branches of an overgrown tree whose limbs dangle onto her roof. She said that since the tree is on the sidewalk outside her home, it was the city's responsibility to take care of it, but her efforts to get something done have been unsuccessful.
"They tell me the city is short of people," she said.
But Mrs. Felix, a retired hospital worker, said she voted for Mr. Dinkins before and planned to do so again, following the lead of Dennis Rivera, the hospital workers' union leader who is a key ally of Mr. Dinkins's.
For Antonio Burgos Sr., how the Mayor says something is just as important as what he says. The 55-year-old plumber had voted previously for Mr. Dinkins, but is considering supporting Mr. Giuliani. He faulted Mr. Dinkins for being too deliberate.
"For Dinkins to say anything, he needs to read," Mr. Burgos said. "It doesn't matter to me where the man is from. If he knows what he's saying, it's good."
Like other Hispanic voters of his generation, Mr. Burgos contrasted Mr. Dinkins's public style with that of his predecessor, Edward I. Koch.
"People talk a lot about Koch, but for me he was the best," Mr. Burgos said. "He spoke his mind. If you got hurt you got hurt, but he told you the truth. He didn't care where it fell."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Accuses Dinkins Of Being a Weak Leader

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giulinai made a blistering advertising attack on Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday, criticizing his record and accusing him of weak leadership that has caused the city to lose 350,000 jobs, allowed government scandals and public disorder to flourish and encouraged racial divisiveness.
Though Mr. Giuliani has attacked the condition of the city on the stump and in commercials before, the two new commercials mark the first time he has taken on Mr. Dinkins's record -- and what Mr. Giuliani calls his lack of accountability -- in paid advertising with such blunt, confrontational language that clearly seeks to put Mr. Dinkins on the defensive. 
 One of the 30-second spots attributes a list of government failures to Mr. Dinkins, including the 1990 boycott of a Korean grocery store in Brooklyn, the 1991 racial disturbances in Crown Heights, ethical questions about a contract for collecting parking violation fines, and botched asbestos inspections in public schools.
The commercial fails to note that the asbestos inspections occurred before Mr. Dinkins's election and that the Mayor responded as soon as he learned of the problem.
"And all David Dinkins says is, it's not my fault," the narrator says. "Maybe he's right. Maybe it was our fault four years ago."
 
'Not Innuendo'
 David Garth, who is Mr. Giuliani's chief campaign strategist, said of the new campaign, "It's not innuendo -- it lays it right out there based on facts."
Mr. Dinkins's chief media adviser, Robert Shrum, called the new commercials a "reckless" effort by a candidate who is "sinking."
"Gone is the nice little kid who grew up in Brooklyn liking the Yankees and getting knocked in the mud," said Mr. Shrum, referring to an earlier commercial for Mr. Giuliani. "He forgot to tell us he collected bags of mud for future use."
Mr. Dinkins has also aired harsh ads, linking Mr. Giuliani to policies of the Reagan Administration and accusing him of waffling on the abortion issue.
The new commercials follow closely sets of commercials by Mr. Giuliani intended to reach Hispanic voters and to pressure Mr. Dinkins into debating him.
Though the candidates have been at an impasse over the debate issue for months, Mr. Giuliani gave it a higher profile this week with commercials that call on Mr. Dinkins to meet in a "one-on-one, face-to-face" confrontation.
Those commercials began running on Tuesday.
 
Sharply Worded Response
 Mr. Dinkins replied by releasing a sharply worded letter on Tuesday, accusing Mr. Giuliani of "being afraid of" a debate that involves George J. Marlin, the Conservative Party candidate.
With less than three weeks left in the campaign, neither candidate seems willing to blink first.
Mr. Dinkins says he will not appear in any debates without Mr. Marlin, whom he calls a "major-party candidate."
Mr. Giuliani has refused to appear in any forum or debate with Mr. Marlin because, he says, Mr. Marlin's main goal is to attack him.
Their disagreement has left several television stations and civic organizations in the lurch, uncertain of whether debates that have been under discussion since the summer will go forward. One station, WABC-TV, canceled a debate scheduled for yesterday because Mr. Giuliani refused to attend.
In at least one other case, a debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters and St. Francis College is expected to proceed tonight with Mr. Marlin and Mr. Dinkins but not Mr. Giuliani.
Others, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and WCBS-TV, have said they may proceed with mayoral debates even if one candidate is not present.
The battle over the debates says as much about the closeness of the race as about the two candidates' strategies. Several recent polls have shown the two men running neck and neck, and political strategists said neither candidate wants to appear to have capitulated to the other or be subjected to the unpredictable arena of a televised debate at this time.
"A debate is a big risk from both vantage points," said Lee M. Miringoff director of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion. "Things can happen in a debate. If you stick to controlled campaign stops and paid advertising, less happens."
There has not been unanimity on the debate issue among Mr. Giuliani's running mates. Herman Badillo, the Republican-Liberal candidate for city comptroller, has said he will only debate his Democratic rival, Alan G. Hevesi. Mr. Hevesi will debate two other candidates tonight. But Susan Alter, the Republican-Liberal candidate for public advocate, said yesterday that she would debate other candidates, provided she had at least one head-to-head debate with Mark Green, the Democrat.
But yesterday, hours before a scheduled debate between public-advocate candidates that did not include Ms. Alter, aides to Mr. Garth threatened to withdraw all of Ms. Alter's campaign commercials from New York 1 News if the station broadcast the debate, said Richard Aurelio, president of the cable network. Ms. Alter has spent $22,000 in advertising with the station.
When asked if anyone on his staff had threatened to pull Ms. Alter's ads, Mr. Garth said, "Somebody here might have called, but I can't control that."

HEADLINE: Rabin Says Sales to China Didn't Break U.S. Law

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzak Rabin, acknowledged on a state visit today that his country had sold arms to Beijing, but he disputed a United States intelligence estimate of the size of the sales and insisted that they do not violate any restrictions on transferring American weapons technology.
At a news conference, Mr. Rabin responded to a United States Central Intelligence Agency report in Washington suggesting that over the last decade, Israel had sold several billion dollars worth of arms and military technology to China. 
 "All these stories of billions of dollars of arms business in the past 10 years are total nonsense," Mr. Rabin told reporters. But he declined to discuss the specifics of Israeli military assistance.
He said that Israel's reported annual trade with China undermines the C.I.A. estimate. The figure for 1992 was about $60 million, he said.
 
Rabin Says Law Was Upheld
 "We have made it clear time and again," Mr. Rabin said, "that we have never done anything against American law." He said that with the exception of a sale of American jet fighters to Ecuador, Israel has "never transmitted items of technology that we got from the United States" under restrictions that prevented re-export.
Mr. Rabin said, "We are not stupid enough to endanger" Israel's annual $3 billion aid package from the United States, and its longstanding military and intelligence sharing ties with Washington, by violating licensing agreements.
Israel is believed to have assisted China in improving its missile arsenal, including surface-to-surface missiles used as offensive weapons, surface-to-air missiles used in air defense and air-to-air missiles used in air combat. Improving China's tank armor and providing airborne early warning technology are also believed to be part of the Israeli assistance.
 
Modernization Proceeding
 China's military modernization program, according to Western analysts, is proceeding at a modest pace, but does not have as high a national priority as economic reform and civilian development programs.
"I'm really sorry that from time to time there are leaks that cannot be proved about Israel doing something which is in contradiction to our commitments to the United States in the field of defense," Mr. Rabin said before leaving Beijing for Shanghai.
These sales boost Israel's trade and defer weapons development costs for Israeli defense industries. They may also increase the Israelis' influence with Beijing as they try to halt ballistic missile sales in the Middle East.
 
Concerns of Israel
 At the same time, Israel must beware of providing technologies and weapons that someday could be turned against Israeli targets. And if American technology is the foundation of an Israeli weapon system, the Israeli Government, in selling such weapons, would run the risk of embarrassing clashes with Washington.
One of the best examples of how Chinese technology can return to the Middle East to bedevil Israeli security planners was the 1988 sale by China of CSS-2 medium-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia. These missiles gave the Saudis the ability to strike any Middle Eastern capital with large high-explosive warheads.
Mr. Rabin's visit, the first by a Israeli Prime Minister since formal diplomatic ties were established in early 1992, follows a recent visit by the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat.
Later this month, Beijing will be the host of Arab-Israeli talks on sharing water resources in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Turkish Leader to Press U.S. on Iraq Embargo

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Turkey's Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller, left here tonight for Washington, where she is expected to ask President Clinton a question that has come to preoccupy many political and economic leaders here and elsewhere: how long can the Western embargo of Iraq continue without visible political result?
The question is particularly pertinent to Turkey, which says it is losing about $3 billion a year in trade and income from Iraq's pipeline across Turkey, an artery that has been closed since the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis in August 1990. 
 Diplomats and officials here say Mrs. Ciller's primary aim when she meets Mr. Clinton on Friday will be to press for relief from the cost of Turkey's pivotal role in applying the sanctions against Iraq. Accordingly, she is expected to seek Mr. Clinton's assessment of Iraqi progress in meeting the terms of United Nations resolutions on the sanctions.
Officials said Prime Minister Ciller was likely to press President Clinton to support the draining and refilling of the pipeline. Mrs. Ciller, a Western diplomat said, will probably launch "an appeal to the U.S. to take a leadership role in helping Turkey solve its problems." But the United States, he said, will "find itself short on resources to respond to an appeal."
The questions go to the heart of Turkey's problem as a remote Western ally lodged among unruly and hostile neighbors in the east: While it pursues a Western identity, it is also a player and a trader in rough region.
After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Turkey, a member of NATO, was among the first to support the coalition assembled by the Bush Administration. Ankara severed trade ties with Baghdad worth an estimated $1 billion dollars a year and, most important to the West, closed down the pipeline that carried oil from northern Iraq to world markets. The shutdown is denying Baghdad the chance of selling oil to rebuild further, but it also is denying Turkey income and oil supplies.
 
'Who Is Suffering?'
 "Without any hesitation, Turkey supported the coalition," Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said in an interview tonight, but added: "Who is suffering from the embargo? Turkey and the Iraqi people, not the leaders, not those who created this problem."
Mr. Cetin also said that since the gulf war, Baghdad's authority no longer extended to Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, giving a base to Kurdish guerrillas seeking a separate state in southeastern Turkey.
"The north of Iraq is like a no-man's-land," he said, hinting that Turkey viewed the return of some normalcy in Iraq as a priority. "The territorial integrity and unity of Iraq is very important for the whole region and for us."
The Foreign Minister continued: "The problem is how long will this continue? Saddam is there, sanctions are there and no one knows how this will continue to the end. We want to find a solution, and we are not as pleased as the others. They have all left the area and we are here with all the questions because Iraq is our neighbor."
Along with other officials, Mr. Cetin said Turkey had no plans to break with the coalition. But while saying that "what we do, we have to do with the United Nations and our allies," he indicated that his Government wanted progress on a tentative Turkish-Iraqi agreement to drain and refill the oil pipeline so that its jointly owned contents could be sold.
For some Turks, an issue of equal importance is their Government's worry that the Russian military, strengthened by its alliance with President Boris N. Yeltsin in crushing the revolt by Parliament last week, will feel emboldened to exercise its power in such former Soviet republics as Georgia and Azerbaijan -- both of which are just to the east of Turkey.
Prime Minister Ciller, officials said, is also likely to register sharp differences with the Clinton Administration over developments in Russia, which are seen in Ankara not so much as a free-market democracy striving for life as a potential regional threat pursuing what one official termed "a grand Russian design, a hidden hand in the Caucasus" on Turkey's borders.

HEADLINE: ROMANIA GRANTED FULL TRADE STATUS

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The House of Representatives has given its seal of approval to Romania by voting to restore normal trade relations.
With Senate approval assured, the unanimous vote on Tuesday permits the United States to resume normal trade with Romania for the first time since 1988, when the former Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, scuttled a trade deal because of his objections to American demands that Romania improve its behavior on human rights. 
 At the time of the break, the benefits of so-called most-favored-nation trading status were estimated by the Commerce Department to be worth $300 million to Romania, affecting exports totaling $800 million.
The value now will be much smaller because Romania has been staggered by a slow transition from a Communist command economy to a market economy. But the granting anew of trade preferences is likely to encourage sorely needed foreign investments in Romania and to signal greater credit worthiness to lenders.
 
Status Rejected a Year Ago
 A year ago, the House voted by an overwhelming majority to reject a Bush Administration proposal to restore trade benefits, mainly on the ground that efforts by Bucharest to institute democratic practices in Romania were insufficient.
Romania under Ceausescu, despite his highly repressive regime, was one of the few Communist countries to be accorded most-favored-nation status, principally in recognition of its permissive policy toward emigration of Jews. But after the fall of Europe's Communist regimes four years ago, Washington deemed the successor Government ineligible for the preferences.
Members of Congress concerned with Romania maintained a skeptical attitude toward the Government of President Ion Iliescu even after the Administration began, in 1992, to give it good marks for taking steps to increase press freedom, privatize business, hold democratic elections and bring the Romanian intelligence services under legislative control.
These concerns were reflected today in remarks by several Congressmen who said they still had reservations about the Government's behavior.
"They still need to clean up their act on the Hungarian minority," said Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico. Tom Lantos, a California Democrat of Hungarian origin, said there had been "some improvement" in Romania's conduct following "outrageous human rights violations" against ethnic Hungarians and Gypsies.

HEADLINE: First Interstate Ascends As a Banking Phoenix

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
In the summer of 1990, Edward M. Carson, the newly appointed chairman of the First Interstate Bancorporation, promised angry shareholders that he would cut the bank's bad loans to 1 percent of assets by the end of 1993, from a level of 5 percent.
Recession interceded, real estate values here collapsed, and the only other major bank based in Los Angeles, the Security Pacific Corporation, was virtually destroyed. But Mr. Carson will deliver on his pledge: When First Interstate announces its earnings on Oct. 18, problem loans are expected to be below 1 percent, three months ahead of schedule. 
 Mr. Carson, in fact, has presided over one of the most remarkable transformations in banking. He not only rescued First Interstate from financial oblivion, but he completely reversed its strategy.
"Ed Carson should be banker of the year," said George Salem, a bank analyst at Prudential Securities. "Two years ago everyone said they were about to be acquired, but he has brought the organization to a much healthier state."
Joseph J. Pinola, the chairman of First Interstate for most of the 1980's, had fancied the bank as a dynamic global financial services company competing with Citicorp and Merrill Lynch. He ventured into many acquisitions and new activities, like international merchant banking.
The excitement almost killed the bank. Mr. Pinola was inattentive to the problems that were building in the company's existing banks, and some of his new acquisitions, especially a bank in Texas, turned out to be awash in bad loans.
When he took over, Mr. Carson said in effect, "There is no place like home." He declared that First Interstate would be local, not global; consistent, not dynamic. And he shed nearly all the company's activities not related to basic banking services for consumers and small companies in its 13 Western states.
"Our business is a man, a wife, two kids and a station wagon," Mr. Carson said in his office atop the 72-story headquarters tower commissioned by Mr. Pinola. "When we stepped out of that realm and started making big loans, it all went bad."
Although he now lives in Beverly Hills, Mr. Carson -- a 42-year employee of the bank -- gives the impression that he has just parked that station wagon. With an avuncular manner and piercing sky-blue eyes, Mr. Carson communicates his strategy by disseminating aphorisms like "Keep things as simple as possible" on company bulletin boards.
 
Much Like Jimmy Stewart
 "Carson reminds me very much of Jimmy Stewart in personality and the roles he plays," says Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. "He has restored a sense of calm and order to management even as he presided over substantial cost cutting and restructuring."
Mr. Carson eliminated more than a quarter of the company's 35,000 jobs. And he forced bank officers to take an intensive training program on how to avoid making bad loans with a test so tough that more than a third failed and had to find new jobs at First Interstate or leave the company.
Most important, Mr. Carson decided to bail out of $3 billion in California real estate loans at the beginning of 1991, a year before the other banks in the state realized the extent of the problems here.
As a result, after heavy losses in 1991, the bank's earnings and capital have risen steadily while bad loans have fallen. In the second quarter, the company's profits were at an annual rate of just over 1 percent of assets, a benchmark level for a healthy bank.
[First Interstate's stock gained 37.5 cents, to $67.625, on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday. The current stock price represents roughly a 72 percent increase from its 52-week low of $39.]
This success shows the profound change in the aspirations of the banking industry. The role model for many banks is no longer the far-flung Citibank, but the neighborhood branches of Banc One. "The wimps of the 1980's have become the heroes of the 1990's," said Robert F. Smith, a former chairman of Security Pacific.
Mr. Carson took drastic action to turn First Interstate into a "nouvelle" wimp. He sold or closed most of its units outside the Western United States and got out of lucrative but volatile activities like foreign exchange trading.
"If they are not being chewed up with bad credit, our banks are very predictable," Mr. Carson said. "We couldn't afford to have a 'for-ex' trader come in to us on the day before the end of the quarter and say they just lost $30 million or even made $30 million. Our shareholders did not enjoy being surprised."
 
An Enjoyable Surprise
 A surprise the shareholders of First Interstate have found enjoyable has been how little trouble the California recession has caused to the bank's loan portfolio. After living through unpleasant surprises in Texas, Arizona and Colorado, the bank's executives were especially sensitive to the first signs that the California real estate market was softening.
"We saw the same trends we saw in Texas, vacancy rates going up and the power turning to the tenant away from the landlords, so we said, 'Here it comes,' " said William E. B. Siart, the intense, intellectual president of First Interstate.
So, in 1991 First Interstate placed $6.8 billion of its $30 billion in loans, half from California, in a special pool for aggressive workouts, where borrowers are given the opportunity to work out of their financial problems and repay their outstanding loans. Less than a third of those loans were behind on their payments, but in Texas the bank had developed a philosophy of dealing with potential problems quickly before they get worse.
"We're good at getting rid of not only known problems but anything that smells like a problem," said Allen D. Brown, who ran workouts in Texas and later for the holding company. He tried to get these loans out of the bank by any possible means, often selling properties at deep discounts or accepting reduced payouts.
 
Limits Set on Exposure
 In 1991 many other California banks scoffed at First Interstate, and some even lent money to customers booted out by the bank. "I'm not sitting here saying I'm a genius, but there were a lot of people in this town with blind faith," Mr. Carson said. "It was very difficult to turn away customers. Yet it was clear we had to do something."
At the same time, Mr. Siart was assigned to oversee an overhaul of the bank's lending procedures to insure that it would never again get into this sort of trouble. The bank set limits on its exposure to various categories of loans, some far lower than in the past. And it created procedures to identify potential problems in the future.
"You don't get in trouble for having a good loan go bad; you get in trouble for being surprised that it went bad," said Bruce Willison, the head of First Interstate Bank of California.
The lending officers were put through a training program followed by a rigorous, six-hour test. "Of 2,300 lending people, 1,500 passed and 800 people found anther career," said Mr. Siart, who passed only 8 of the 15 sections when he took the test. Lending officers had to retake the test until they passed it all or find new jobs.
 
Fewer Loans Made
 Predictably, the bankers at First Interstate are making fewer loans. It has $43 billion in low-cost deposits from its 1,000 branches. Since it has only $24 billion in loans, it has been forced to invest $15 billion of spare cash in low-yielding bonds.
Mr. Siart calculated that if the bank's loans rose to $30 billion, which is only 60 percent of its $49 billion in assets, not a very high percentage for a bank, First Interstate's profitability, as measured by return on equity, would increase to an outstanding 18.5 percent from an unremarkable 16 percent.
Making $6 billion in new loans is no small task, especially if the bank sticks to its strict new credit policies. While the buoyant economy in the Mountain states is increasing loan demand there, California is a disaster.
"The California recession has stayed down longer than any of us had expected," Mr. Willison said. "At the beginning of 1992, we felt there would be an upturn by the end of that year. Now we don't expect much good news until mid-1994."
 
Looking at Acquisitions
 The recession has created some opportunity for First Interstate because it is in better shape than many of its competitors. Many smaller banks are saddled by loan losses, and Bank of America has been preoccupied with integrating Security Pacific, which it bought in 1991.
First Interstate is looking to acquisitions as a source of growth. In August, the company agreed to buy the San Diego Trust and Savings Bank, which has $2 billion in assets, for $340 million, a hefty 2.6 times its book value.
But that bank had a good franchise and low loan losses, and as the only independent bank in a growing market it was "the last opportunity to get into San Diego in a significant way," Mr. Willison said.
And Mr. Carson said he hoped more acquisitions would help him build market share in California, Texas and Washington, although he said he did not want to go beyond this home region.
With most of the medium-sized banks in California owned by Japanese banks, which despite their problems show no sign of being willing to sell them, First Interstate is eager to acquire one of the large California savings and loan institution like Great Western Bank, Mr. Willison said.
 
Merger Questions Linger
 Ironically, the success of Mr. Carson has raised the same question he faced in the dark period when he started: Will First Interstate be sold or merged into another large regional banking company? The low-risk, back-to-basics branch banking strategy of First Interstate makes it an attractive addition to any number of other institutions. But with its stock at a relatively high multiple, the bank could also remain independent, if it wanted.
An important clue to the bank's thinking in this regard will be how it approaches naming a successor to Mr. Carson, who is 64. Banking analysts said banks with older chairmen were far more likely to be acquired than those with younger chief executives.
While Mr. Siart, 46, is considered the leading candidate, Mr. Carson refuses to call him an heir apparent. For now, Mr. Carson simply says he is keeping his options open.
"I don't want to be a lame duck," he said.

At the Wire, U.A.W. Balks On Ford Pact

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Two hours before they were to formally sign a three-year contract negotiated last month with the Ford Motor Company, top officials of the United Automobile Workers union notified Ford that they were unhappy with the company's view of one provision and would not sign.
Ford officials said they were caught off guard Tuesday night by the union's objection, which deals with a section giving workers a four-day weekend around Independence Day. Ford and the union had scheduled a signing ceremony at 10 A.M. today, which they called off at 8 A.M. No new date for signing the agreement was scheduled.
 
No Longer Settled
 It was a highly unusual, perhaps unprecedented, move by the U.A.W., since the Ford agreement had already been ratified by the union's members at the No. 2 auto maker by a 2-to-1 margin, and the union had publicly treated it as a done deal. Furthermore, the U.A.W. is now locked in negotiations with the General Motors Corporation. 
 While Ford said it expected to reach agreement on the provision without a strike and without rewriting the rest of the contract, union officials were far less optimistic today.
At issue are paid holidays intended to provide a four-day weekend over the Independence Day holiday in 1995 and 1996. The union won the new days off as part of the agreement. But U.A.W. officials said today that they were concerned that those new days might overlap with traditional two-week production shutdowns at Ford plants.
Most workers already use their vacation time during that two-week period. While workers may still realize a net gain in time off under the new contract, they could lose the special four-day weekend the U.A.W. intended to create if it falls during the production shutdown.
"We're having a discussion about the holiday provision," said David Caplan, a Ford spokesman. "What the union has asked us to consider is moving that vacation shutdown out of that Fourth of July week so that the holiday and the shutdown do not overlap." Mr. Caplan said, however, that moving that shutdown period could prove difficult because it would upset company production schedules.
 
Wider Problems With Pattern?
 Since negotiating with Ford, the U.A.W. has used the agreement as a pattern in establishing a tentative contract with the Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler contract incorporates the July 4 holiday provision, but it was unclear today whether union officials were also concerned about an overlap with production shutdowns there.
The U.A.W. has not set a strike deadline in negotiations with G.M., a sign that it believes the talks are making progress. Although G.M. has repeatedly raised concerns that the pattern agreement will raise its labor costs and slow its efforts to reduce plant capacity and payrolls, the company appears likely to accept the basic package of wages and benefits, perhaps before the weekend.
Among other things, the contract provides for increases in pension benefits for retirees that could raise G.M.'s unfunded pension liability to $25 billion by the end of the year, from a previously expected $19 billion. Besides that, the new contract builds up job-security funds for laid-off workers, funds that cost G.M. more than $3 billion under the current contract negotiated in 1990.
Company officials have pushed for greater freedom to move laid-off workers to other plants. Now, G.M. cannot require workers to relocate to another plant more than 50 miles from their old one. If the new plant is within 50 miles, it can reduce workers' layoff benefits if they refuse to move.
General Motors is also trying to change its hourly workers' vacation benefits. Like Ford, it shuts down for two weeks during the summer. But unlike at Ford, hourly workers at G.M. are considered temporarily laid off during that two-week period, meaning that they can collect unemployment benefits paid by the company.
G.M. would like its hourly workers to use some of their vacation time during the two-week shutdown.
Such a change -- which many G.M. workers vehemently oppose -- would save the company millions of dollars in unemployment costs.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Accord Set in Canada
 TORONTO, Oct. 13 (Reuters) -- The president of the automobile workers union in Canada said the union and the Ford Motor Company of Canada had reached a tentative three-year labor deal ahead of a midnight strike deadline. The union has now reached accord with all of the Big Three American auto makers.
The union's president, Buzz Hargrove, said Ford Canada accepted all components of the pattern agreement the union reached with the Chrysler Corporation's Canadian unit.
The union also won a demand not in the pattern agreement: mandatory vacation time. Workers could previously accept money in lieu of time off. "The major issue of mandatory vacation was the key issue here," Mr. Hargrove said.
The accord marked the first time in more than three decades that the Canadian union had reached settlement with the three companies without resorting to a strike, he said.

HEADLINE: Lehman Bros. to Move 900 Back-Office Jobs to Jersey City

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
After months of speculation, Lehman Brothers Inc. has decided to move more than 900 back-office employees to Jersey City, to the same 42-floor tower to which Merrill Lynch moved 2,500 back-office jobs a year ago.
Richard S. Fuld Jr., Lehman Brothers' president, said the decision to move was the result of a six-month study of future space needs, and reaffirmed plans to keep 5,000 employees in New York, the bulk at company headquarters at 3 World Financial Center. 
 "We believe our decision to relocate certain employees to our headquarters building in New York City and to a new space in Jersey City best serves the interests of the firm," he said in a formal statement issued yesterday evening.
Word of Lehman's decision played differently on the two sides of the Hudson River.
The company's impending arrival at 101 Hudson Street, where it will occupy 340,000 square feet on 11 floors, is a cause for joy in Jersey City, which has an unemployment rate of almost 12 percent, compared with less than 8 percent for the rest of the state.
"Anytime a new employer comes to the city it means more people who will spend money and enrich the economy, and that is what we have been trying so hard to promote," said Thomas M. Gallagher, press secretary to Jersey City's Mayor, Bret Schundler.
 
In an Urban Enterprise Zone
 Moreover, 101 Hudson Street is in a state-designated Urban Enterprise Zone. Office supplies and equipment sold by vendors in such zones are exempt from sales tax. That might encourage Lehman Brothers to make many such purchases from nearby vendors, further helping the local economy.
Lehman's move is a blow to New York, which will lose more than 900 jobs and the taxes associated with them. It is also a blow to the downtown Manhattan real-estate market, which is plagued with a persistent 22 percent vacancy rate. Many industry professionals had expected Lehman Brothers to move into 344,000 square feet at One Financial Square, a 36-story, million-square-foot building on the block bounded by Old Slip, Gouverneur Lane, Front Street and South Street. One Financial Square is half empty.
"We had an agreement in principle and a 100-page document ready to be signed," said a disappointed Arthur J. Mirante, chief executive officer of Cushman & Wakefield, leasing and managing agents for One Financial Square. "Then they decide to go to New Jersey."
New York City officials refused to discuss the incentives they had offered, although real-estate brokers say that New York was sweetening its offer as recently as late last week. However, few say the offer was particularly lucrative. In a statement issued after Lehman's announcement, Mayor David N. Dinkins expressed his disappointment that 900 jobs were moving to New Jersey, but added that "the city cannot justify the high cost per job it would have taken to match Lehman's projected savings."
"I am pleased to learn that more than 5,000 jobs will stay headquartered in New York," Mr. Dinkins said.
Mr. Gallagher said that Jersey City did not offer financial incentives, that its tax structure was enough incentive.
"We have no city payroll tax, no city income tax, no corporate tax, we don't even have an unincorporated business tax or a tax on commercial leases," he said.
 
Cheaper Power, Lower Rent
 Real-estate brokers watching the deal said that Lehman also was lured by the extensive emergency backup systems offered at 101 Hudson Street, and that power costs 15 percent less in New Jersey than in New York. They said that Lehman struck a deal in the vicinity of $15 a square foot a year, and that One Financial Square was insisting on more than $20.
One source said that Lehman concluded that it would be just as easy for many of its employees to commute to Jersey City by PATH trains as to get to One Financial Square, which is much farther east than the company's current offices.
"This simply did not boil down to a battle over incentives," said one real-estate broker who insisted on anonymity.
There was never a question that Lehman Brothers would have to move its back offices. It used to be part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a subsidiary of American Express. Its back office and trading operations were at 388 and 390 Greenwich Street, which American Express owned.
But in March the Primerica Corporation bought the Shearson part of the subsidiary, including those two buildings. Lehman Brothers, which remains part of American Express, must vacate the premises by July. Most of Lehman's operations are situated elsewhere in lower Manhattan.

Treasuries Mixed in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Treasury market ended narrowly mixed yesterday as most investors refrained from major transactions ahead of wholesale inflation figures to be released today.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose 3/32 point, or 94 cents for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.91 percent, from 5.92 percent late Tuesday. 
 Prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 1/32 point, and intermediate maturities dropped by as much as 3/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
Bond prices fluctuated in a narrow range of buying and selling as traders shrugged off several developments, including Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 
No Sign From Greenspan
 Mr. Greenspan strongly rejected a move in the House to make the nation's central bank more politically accountable, but he made no comments to suggest any change in monetary policy direction.
The bond market also largely ignored an auto industry report that cars sold at a higher-than-expected annual rate of 6.8 million units over the last 30 days. Economists generally expected a rate of 6.5 million.
But the report did add to speculation that the Government report on September retail sales, also due today, would exceed growth expectations. Forecasts call for an increase of three-tenths of a percent.
Investors in fixed-income securities typically sell bonds in reaction to news of economic growth, which can aggravate inflation. Higher inflation tends to hurt the value of investments that pay a fixed rate of return.
But investors saved most of their attention for today's release of the Producer Price Index for September, which will be followed by the Consumer Price Index tomorrow.

Corporate Issues
 By Bloomberg Business News
 The most notable corporate issue yesterday was $150 million of bonds maturing in 100 years sold by the New York branch of Amsterdam's ABN Amro Bank.
The bank was the third company to sell 100-year bonds in recent months. In July, the Walt Disney Company and the Coca-Cola Company surprised investors by offering 100-year issues, the first debt with such a long maturity since the late 1800's, when railroads sold bonds due in as much as 1,000 years to finance leases on land.
On Tuesday, the Boeing Company offered $125 million of 50-year bonds. The 6.875 percent debentures due in 2043 were priced at 99.788 to yield 6.89 percent. The noncallable debentures were rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by Standard & Poor's.
Investors snapped up the ABN Ambro bonds because interest rates are at historic lows.
The 7.125 percent percent subordinated deposit notes due in 2093 were priced at $991.78 for a $1,000 bond to yield 7.184 percent percent, or 110 basis points more than the 7.125 percent Treasury maturing on Feb. 15, 2023. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. The notes, which are not redeemable, are rated Aa2 by Moody's and A+ by S.& P.
Bonds of cable operators increased in price amid expectations that more companies would form combinations and joint ventures similar to the one announced yesterday by the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc. The Comcast Corporation's 10.625 percent bonds due in 2012 gained $20 a bond to $1,130. Cablevision Systems Inc. 9.875 percent bonds due in 2013 gained $20, to $1,035, and Continental Cable's 9 percent bonds due in 2008 were quoted at $1,050, up $30.
Tele-Communications 9.25 percent bonds due 2023 soared to $1,291.97 per $1,000 face amount, up from $1,150, with its yield declining to 6.91 percent, or 100 basis points more than comparable Treasury bonds.
Bonds of subsidiaries of Bell Atlantic were little changed. Moody's said it might lower the ratings on Bell Atlantic and its operating subsidiaries, which have a total $9.8 billion of debt outstanding.

Drugstores to Sue Pharmaceutical Makers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The nation's largest retail drugstore chains are preparing a broad antitrust lawsuit that accuses leading pharmaceutical companies of price fixing.
Executives from the Rite-Aid Corporation and Revco D.S. Inc., two of the largest drugstore chains, are scheduled to appear today at a news conference in New York to announce the Federal price-discrimination complaint. The plaintiffs operate more than 5,000 pharmacies across the country. 
 Drugstore chains and independent pharmacies have become increasingly incensed over pharmaceutical makers' common practice of discounting bundles of their products to huge purchasers like hospitals, health maintenance organizations and mail-order drug companies.
"The issue is regarding giving discounts simply because of the class of trade," said D. Dwayne Hoven, president and chief executive of Revco, which is based in Twinsburg, Ohio.
 
 
Discounts for Some
 Though he declined to comment on the lawsuit, Mr. Hoven said that certain high-volume purchasers "do get discounts that are not available to community pharmacies" or even big chains like his. Revco employs 3,000 pharmacists in nine states.
Drug companies contend that big purchasers should be rewarded with lower prices. A single health maintenance organization like Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest, can purchase billions of dollars worth of prescription drugs in a year.
The $52 billion chain drugstore industry is struggling to maintain the core prescription department. In the shift toward managed care, more companies are contracting with mail-order pharmacies, which dispense medications across the country from a few central locations. More employees are being told they cannot go to their corner drugstore if they want to be reimbursed for their prescription drugs.
Meanwhile, the nation's drug makers have come under fire from the Clinton Administration for the high price increases they levy on prescription drugs. To stave off possible price controls, the leading pharmaceutical companies have pledged to hold price increases to the inflation rate.

HEADLINE: Japan Is Urged to Insure Foreigners' Trade Share

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 13

 BODY:
As a keystone of its new approach to trade with Japan, the United States will demand that foreign companies gain the same share of the market for various goods and services in Japan as in other industrial nations, an American trade official said today.
The official, who is here for talks aimed at reaching detailed agreements under a broad trade framework signed by the United States and Japan in July, spoke at a news briefing as the talks began in earnest today. The negotiator said that if the United States and Japan could not agree on "objective criteria" to measure the opening of Japanese markets, as was called for in July, Washington would establish such indexes itself. 
 "If we can't do it together then we will do it," said the official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified by name because only the highest-ranking people in his agency are allowed to speak for attribution. "We have to measure results. We have to be able to assess the results at the end of the day."
Today, American representatives presented a proposal for opening Japan's insurance market, pointing out that foreign companies had only 2 percent of that market. For the Group of Seven industrial nations, the market share held by foreign insurers ranges from 7 to 10 percent in the United States to 33 percent in Italy.
 
More if This Succeeds
 "The gap between Japan and the rest of the G-7 is enormous," the official said, adding that one way the Clinton Administration wants to judge the success of the trade agreement is that in three to four years, "the Japanese market would become more in line with the industrialized world." Washington wants to apply the same approach to other businesses and services, he said.
In keeping with July's accord, the two nations are to negotiate detailed agreements aimed at increasing Japan's imports in various business, industries and service areas, and to determine quantitative and qualitative indicators to measure progress.
Japan has said that it will not agree to setting targets.
The two nations had preliminary talks under this arrangement in September. This week and next, the Americans are presenting concrete proposals in three high-priority areas -- insurance, autos and auto parts, and official procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. The aim is to reach agreements in these areas by January or February, when President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa are expected to meet.
The United States argues that Japan's insurance market is effectively closed because strict or unclear regulations prevent the entry of new companies or the introduction of innovative products. It also says that Japanese corporations tend to buy insurance from insurers in their own keiretsu, or industrial groupings.
 
50 States Puzzle Outsiders
 Japan denies that its market is closed. It argues that the American market is hard for foreigners to penetrate because separate licenses must be procured from each state, and in some states, all insurance company directors must submit fingerprints.
The American negotiator said that Washington would step up efforts to enforce the July framework. It has been somewhat lax in this, he said, contending that as a result, world opinion, rallied by Japan, had built up against the framework.
Some American economists have said that the agreement is contrary to free trade and will lead to government-managed trade. Some Asian and European countries have expressed fear that the agreement will give American companies an unfair advantage in selling to Japan.
But the United States trade official said "it's totally bizarre" that the Japanese "can go around the world claiming that they are the protectors of free trade." He asserted that the July framework would help all nations sell more to Japan and that the American demands were in line with calls from Japanese for deregulation.
Regarding the matter of foreign access to the Japanese construction industry, which is not part of these talks, the official said the Japanese had not been negotiating seriously. The United States has threatened to impose sanctions against Tokyo if progress was not made by Nov. 1.
"The sanctions will be in place if something doesn't happen," the official said. "The initiative will have to come from the Japanese. We haven't heard 'boo.' "

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Mark While Gold Prices Retreat

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar firmed against most European currencies yesterday in thin trading, but eased slightly against the Japanese yen.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6020 marks, up from 1.5940 marks on Tuesday. But it slipped to 105.92 yen from 106.02 yen.
Meanwhile, gold prices retreated after Tuesday's run-up of $7.50 an ounce. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, fell $1.60 an ounce, to $367.10.
 
 
Technical Support
 Dealers said the dollar firmed against the mark after defending key technical support levels Tuesday. The dollar drifted from its highs, however, after the Bundesbank allowed German money market rates to hold steady during its weekly tender, rather than allow rates to ease as many had expected. 
 Many dealers bought dollars earlier this year on the expectation that Germany would cut interest rates to spur growth while United States rates would rise as its economy recovered. As long as nothing happened to disturb Germany's slow easing pace or to jolt the American economy, analysts said, there was little reason to alter long-term dollar positions.
"If one is to look just at interest rate differentials, that scenario hasn't changed and there is little reason to buy dollars," Alison Gibbs, a currency analyst for MMS International, said. A narrowing of the spread between German and United States interest rates makes dollars less expensive to own.
 
 
Belgian Franc Falls
 There was more activity in the European market, where the Belgian franc fell to three-year lows against the German mark. The franc has suffered as the Belgian Government tries to deal with its huge budget deficit.
The Bank of Belgium bought Belgian francs for German marks several times to support its currency. The New York Federal Reserve sold marks for Belgian francs, in one of its rare operations that did not involve dollars.
The French franc also fell to its lowest level against the mark in two months, as well as losing ground against the dollar. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 5.6560 francs, up from 5.6015 francs on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the British pound fell in New York to $1.5209 from $1.5325.

HEADLINE: Greenspan and Panel Clash Over Fed's Status

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve came under fierce attack at a Congressional hearing today, as House members called it undemocratic, unaccountable and an exclusive club made up mostly of white males.
But Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, stoutly rejected numerous proposals that would give elected officials more power in choosing Federal Reserve policy makers, saying such steps would be a "major mistake" that could fuel inflation and hurt the economy. 
 At a hearing of the House Banking Committee, the crux of Mr. Greenspan's argument was that the Federal Reserve was operating well, so there was no need for Congress to tinker with it and perhaps create a flood of undesired consequences.
 
Political Factor Is Cited

 
 "If accountability is achieved by putting the conduct of monetary policy under the close influence of politicians subject to short-term election cycle pressures, the resulting policy would likely prove disappointing," Mr. Greenspan said.
The hearing was called by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the banking committee, who is mounting Congress's biggest effort in three decades to revamp the laws governing the Federal Reserve. He is sponsoring a bill that would have the President appoint the presidents of the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks, 5 of whom sit on the Fed's main policy-making committee.
In Mr. Gonzalez's view, the current system is undemocratic because the regional presidents are chosen by local boards dominated by commercial bankers.
Several lawmakers said the proposals to change the Fed had a modest chance of passing. The biggest obstacle is a letter that President Clinton sent Mr. Gonzalez, saying he was disinclined to support the Gonzalez bill because he saw no need to overhaul the Fed.
 
Audits and Taping Proposed
 To increase the Fed's accountability, Mr. Gonzalez's bill calls for conducting full audits of the Fed's operations and videotaping the meetings of its main policy-making committee. Mr. Greenspan said such steps would interfere with the central bank's independence.
In three hours of sparring, Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Greenspan often used pointed language, but their tone was unfailingly polite. Nonetheless, Mr. Gonzalez made clear that he resented the way Fed officials have suggested that his proposal is a mortal danger for the economy.
"This is not radical reform, and there is no cause for the Federal Reserve to proceed as if barbarians are at the gate and it is the end of Western civilization," Mr. Gonzalez said. "We should not pretend the Federal Reserve, of all institutions in Government, is infallible."
Mr. Gonzalez lambasted the Federal Reserve for not hiring more women or members of minorities, noting that only one of the 12 regional bank presidents is a woman and not one is a member of a minority. "I want to take the 'bankers and their friends' sign off the door to this exclusive club and open it up to all competent Americans," he said.
While rejecting virtually all the criticisms leveled at the Fed, Mr. Greenspan granted that the central bank could do more to increase diversity. He said the Fed had made progress, noting that 22 percent of top-echelon Fed officials are women, up from 5 percent in 1977, while 9 percent of the bank's officials belong to minorities, up from 2 percent in 1977.
 
A Republican View
 Mr. Gonzalez's campaign won some support from James A. Leach of Iowa, the committee's ranking Republican, who said it was unseemly for private bankers to choose Fed officials who not only make important policy decisions but also regulate private banks. While opposed to the idea of having the President appoint the regional bank heads, Mr. Leach did propose that the 12 regional presidents be named by the Federal Reserve Board, whose seven members are appointed by the President.
Throughout his testimony, Mr. Greenspan kept returning to his central point, that tinkering with the Fed's independence would upset a finely tuned system that he said had worked well for decades.
"The temptation is to step on the monetary accelerator or at least avoid the monetary brake until after the next election," Mr. Greenspan said, noting that in such cases the Fed would ultimately have to slam on the brakes. "Giving in to such temptations is likely to impart an inflationary bias to the economy and could lead to instability, recession and economic stagnation."
Mr. Gonzalez sought to reassure Mr. Greenspan that he was not trying to influence monetary policy, saying: "I am not seeking to politicize the central bank nor take away its independence. I am not calling for policies that would cause inflation or deflation."

Orange Juice Prices Tumble After Florida Crop Forecast

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Orange juice prices plunged 10 percent yesterday, the largest single drop in three years, after the Agriculture Department's 1993-94 Florida crop report projected larger-than-expected supplies.
On the New York Cotton Exchange, orange juice for November delivery fell 13.20 cents, to $1.1605 a pound. 
 The department said late on Tuesday that it expected the crop to total 172 million 90-pound boxes, 12 million boxes more than some analysts had expected.
"There had been speculation of a bullish report," said Judy Ganes, a commodity analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company. "When that didn't happen, there was no reason left to be in the market."
Still, traders said there were some concerns that storms in March might have reduced this year's crop.
Indeed, some traders were betting on a repeat of the 1991-92 growing season, when the crop was initially estimated at about 170 million boxes but totaled only 140 million boxes, said Steve Platt, commodity analyst with Dean Witter in Chicago.
"The storms in March seemed to have affected the bloom," said Robert Barber, an economist with Florida Citrus Mutual, an association of Florida's orange growers. "When the groves were examined, they were getting a low fruit count. I had seen estimates on the Florida crop as low as 158 million boxes."
 
Hogs Are Lower
 On other commodities markets, hog futures fell sharply amid expectations that farmers would begin to unload more hogs onto the market, traders and analysts said.
Live hogs for December delivery dropped 1.1 cents, to 50.37 cents a pound, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork bellies for February delivery lost 1.27 cents, to 57.87 cents a pound.
The pace of hog slaughter has increased and is expected to rise through the week, analysts said. So far this week, 1.037 million hogs were slaughtered, down only about five-tenths of a percent from a year ago. According the Government's latest inventory estimates on hog herds, slaughter should be falling.
Crude oil prices finished lower after an industry report showed an increase in American crude oil and petroleum product supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for November delivery fell 7 cents, to $18.64 a barrel.

The health care plan could worsen injury-claim abuses.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON'S health care plan makes a cautious stab at curbing malpractice suits, reducing the incentives to go to court and forcing those injured to try mediation first. So there is at least a hope that the total cost of the accident liability system, which runs $130 billion a year in insurance premiums, will fall. Right?
Don't spend the savings just yet. Peter Huber, a legal scholar, points out that the medical malpractice slice represents no more than one-eighth of the total tort liability pie. And there are good reasons to believe that the President's plan would inadvertently fatten the other seven-eighths. 
 In fact, suggests Michael Horowitz of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, passage of a health care package guaranteeing access to treatment -- especially psychiatric treatment -- could force the White House to come to terms with an injury liability system that serves trial lawyers better than it serves the public. "The Administration's bill will, as a certainty, accelerate fraud and abuse in both the liability and health care systems," Mr. Horowitz contends.
If you are injured in an accident it obviously pays to go to a doctor. Even if you are not injured, though, it often pays to go (and go and go).
For starters, many liability claims are covered by the "collateral source rule," which permits aggrieved parties to collect twice for medical bills -- once from their own health insurers and again from those at fault.
More important, notes Jeffrey O'Connell, a professor of law at the University of Virginia, the cost of medical treatment is generally used as a benchmark of injury severity in calculating out-of-court settlements for "pain and suffering." Hence a $4,000 medical bill can be used to leverage a $4,000 profit under the collateral source rule -- and then another two or three times the $4,000 payment for pain and suffering.
Not surprisingly, say those with a jaundiced view of human nature, the system is often abused for all it's worth. Oakley Van Slyke, a consultant in Mission Viejo, Calif., points out that in parts of the country where pain and suffering awards are uncommon, just one auto accident in six generates a claim of bodily injury. In California, by contrast, there are four bodily injury claims for every six accidents.
While it is widely acknowledged that accidents in rural areas generally cause more damage because collision speeds are higher, the reported frequency of whiplash injuries is several times greater in cities, where the probability of claimants being represented by lawyers is much higher. Dan Seagraves, the executive director of the industry-financed Insurance Research Council, estimates that in Philadelphia the "whiplash-to-fender bender" ratio has reached 75 percent.
What does this have to do with the President's health care plan? Little, directly. Indeed, the plan might actually help to contain tort settlements by eliminating the collateral source rule for medical malpractice claims. But it would greatly add to the risk of fraud by underwriting the cost of medical treatment for those who must now finance the enterprise from their own pockets.
This is potentially a bigger-ticket item than one might imagine. In Hawaii, a state with generous universal health coverage, the median number of visits to chiropractors by tort claimants was an astonishing 53 in 1990. And Mr. Horowitz points to an as-yet-unexploited form of coverage that he thinks is ripe for abuse: outpatient psychiatric care.
Today, only a tiny fraction of tort claims are buttressed by expert evidence of emotional trauma. Can you imagine what will happen, Mr. Horowitz asks, if up to 30 visits a year to a psychiatrist or psychologist were automatically covered by insurance?
It is unclear whether this potential impact on tort liability carries much weight with Congress or the White House. After all, suing is the American Way -- and at least thus far, trial lawyers have proved to be a far more effective lobby than businesses or insurance companies worried about rising liability premiums.
But Washington is sensitive to the cost of health insurance. Indeed, health care reform is being sold as both a means of containing health care costs and a way of extending coverage. And it is precisely the people who are now underinsured who would be given the added incentive to build accident liability claims by running up medical bills.
One counterargument is that health care reform will sensitize medical payers to potential abuses. For example, it is at least possible that the "gate-keepers" in the proposed system, regional health alliances that must live under Federal expenditure caps, would not allow all those whiplashed Hawaiians to make second homes of their chiropractors' offices. Possible, but hardly inevitable.
The surer route to cost control, Mr. O'Connell suggests, would be a serious effort to reform the tort liability system as well. "With luck," he said, "Congress won't allow one interest group -- the plaintiffs' bar -- to sabotage the health care reform."

HEADLINE: THE PLAYOFFS;
But the Blue Jays Have Some Storybook Characters, Too

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Now that the Toronto Blue Jays have proved they can repeat as American League pennant winners despite a wholesale change in their appearance, they go to the World Series to see if they can repeat there, too, with their adaptable dozen.
The Blue Jays, who wrapped up the pennant Tuesday night in Chicago, have 12 players among the 25 who were not on their World Series roster a year ago; the most important cast changes were Paul Molitor playing the role of Dave Winfield and Dave Stewart as Jack Morris. 
 In becoming only the second team in the last 15 years to have a chance to win two successive World Series, the Blue Jays have answered the widespread questions raised by their decision to make those changes last winter. They lost most of their departed players as free agents, some of whom they tried to re-sign, some of whom they let go by economic design.
Molitor, who played his first 15 major league seasons in Milwaukee, was one of those signed as free agents to balance the large losses. About two weeks before the start of the season, he discussed the effect the changes could have on the team.
 
Difficult to Measure
 "It's a difficult thing to measure," he said then. "The irony is this is a championship ball club, and it has such a different look from last year. There have been dramatic changes. There will be inevitable comparisons. When you're successful and you make changes and then if you don't do well, people will say if it ain't broke, why fix it."
It wasn't broke, and General Manager Pat Gillick was only trying to fix the payroll, a major league high $49.5 million. But by the time he was finished maneuvering, particularly with the late-season addition of Rickey Henderson, the Blue Jays wound up with a payroll only slightly lower than last year, just shy of $48 million, with some post-season bonuses to be added.
"It feels good," Gillick said yesterday by telephone from Toronto, discussing the team's success. "We moved a lot of people around out of necessity, more financial necessity than anything else. It wasn't that we wanted to get rid of the players. They certainly would've been welcomed back. But we couldn't handle it financially."
Gillick, however, was delighted to pay out the latest $50,000. That sum goes to Stewart as a bonus for being named the most valuable player of the league championship series.
"That's good," Gillick acknowledged. "I'm happy about that."
Stewart wasn't spreading the bonus among his teammates, but he was passing out accolades.
"To me, this is the best ball club I've played with, offensively," Stewart said. "We've got a lineup with so much talent. We've got guys who care about what they're doing. They take their jobs seriously. They know what they have to do to win. Starting with Paul Molitor. He's my favorite player. He has an idea of what he has to do. If there's a play he can make a bigger play, he goes for it."
When the Blue Jays let Winfield go as a free agent and decided to sign Molitor, five years younger, the popular view was that Molitor couldn't possibly contribute more offensively than Winfield did. But Molitor topped Winfield in batting average, .332 to .290; runs batted in, 111 to 108; slugging percentage, .509 to .491, and on-base percentage, .402 to .377. He fell only four home runs short of matching Winfield's total of 26.
 
Stewart Comes Through
 The Stewart move was questioned, too. The Blue Jays signed him for significantly less money than Jimmy Key and David Cone would have cost them, and the skeptics were correct. A combination of injuries and ineffectiveness limited him to a 12-8 record during the season. But with two victories against Chicago, he responded to the high standards he had established in four previous pennant playoffs.
"When the season started with injuries, Paul Beeston and Pat Gillick said what's important is that I be able to pitch at this point of the year," Stewart related. "Regardless of what happened during the year, they expected me to come through at this time of year."
And Stewart did, raising his playoff record to eight victories (no other pitcher has more than four playoff victories) and no losses in 10 starts, a 2.03 earned run average and a ratio of nine baserunners per nine innings. With his victories against the White Sox, Stewart outdid the 1992 peformance of Morris, who won 21 times during the season but lost three post-season games while winning none.
Morris was back this season but suffered a season-ending elbow injury last month.
As they head into the World Series, the Blue Jays have to watch for a change in Stewart's effectiveness. In six previous Series starts, he has a creditable 2.49 e.r.a. but a 2-3 record.
Manager Cito Gaston indicated in the flush of playoff success that he would use his pitchers in the same order as he did against the White Sox, meaning that Juan Guzman and Stewart would start the first two games Saturday and Sunday.
Gaston wasn't prepared to say, but Molitor most likely will start at third base instead of Ed Sprague in the three games in the National League city, when the designated hitter will not be used.
Sprague was a member of the World Series roster last year, but he batted only three times, all as a pinch-hitter. Gaston doesn't use pinch-hitters much any more. The Blue Jays were the last major league team to use a pinch-hitter during the season -- Darnell Coles on May 13, in the team's 34th game -- and Gaston didn't call for one in six games against the White Sox. In fact, the same nine players played every inning of every game against the White Sox.
 
All Sorts of Changes
 Sprague has become the everyday third baseman, replacing Kelly Gruber. Tony Fernandez has returned to play shortstop, a job vacated by Manuel Lee. Duane Ward, who had been the setup reliever for the closer, has replaced the departed Tom Henke as the closer. Pat Hentgen has moved into the starting rotation.
Danny Cox, Al Leiter and Tony Castillo are new to the World Series bullpen, and veterans Coles and Dick Schofield and rookies Willie Canate and Rob Butler are new to the reserve unit, the guys who don't play. Gone are pitcher David Wells, reserves Pat Tabler, Rance Mulliniks and Derek Bell and left fielder Candy Maldonado.
In Maldonado's place, of course, is the enigmatic Henderson. When the Blue Jays acquired him from Oakland July 31, they expected him to lead the charge to the post-season. But Henderson has hit a stunningly low .202 for the Blue Jays, including .120 (3 for 25) in the playoff.
That kind of performance won't help the Blue Jays become the first team since the 1977-78 Yankees to win two successive World Series championships. Since then, only the Athletics, with Henderson on hand, have had a chance to repeat. They won the Earthquake Series in 1989 and returned the next season but lost to Cincinnati in four games.

HEADLINE: Conners to Return to Yanks

 BODY:
The looting of the Yankee coaching staff is expected to begin today or tomorrow when the club announces that Billy Conners, the Chicago Cubs' pitching coach who held the same job with the Yankees, has been hired to replace Tony Cloninger, who was the pitching coach last season.
While General Manager Gene Michael refused to confirm what has been speculation for weeks, a Yankee official said the announcement could occur within 48 hours. Another American League general manager said the Yankees had dismissed four coaches, likely meaning that first-base coach Frank Howard, bullpen coach Mark Connor and bench coach Ed Napoleon will join Cloninger in the unemployment line. Since Manager Buck Showalter had already conceded that the Yankees would trim their staff from seven coaches to six, Jake Gibbs was already believed to be relieved of his coaching duties. 
 The 51-year-old Connors has coached for the Cubs since June 29, 1991, in his second stint with the team. He would assume his second stint with the Yankees, where he was the pitching coach in 1989 and 1990. A close friend of Showalter and an ally of owner George Steinbrenner, he has been rumored as a Yankee coaching candidate for two years.

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers Job Training For Trade Pact Casualties

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration proposed a $100 million program today to help retrain Americans who lose their jobs because of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But critics of the pact were unimpressed by the proposal.
The Administration, which has long insisted that few Americans would be put out of work by the trade agreement, put the plan forward as a way of blunting opposition by unions and some Congressional Democrats. 
 The chief deputy United States trade representative, Rufus Yerxa, told the House Ways and Means Committee this morning that the Administration was drafting the retraining plan as a temporary measure that would last no more than 18 months. After that, Mr. Yerxa said, workers put out of work by the trade pact would be helped by a comprehensive job training program that is being prepared by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich.
Mr. Reich said at a Senate Labor Committee hearing this morning that the cost of the program "would probably be in the neighborhood of $100 million a year."
 
Fears of Added Costs
 For months the Clinton Administration has resisted promising any such temporary job retraining program, fearing that it would increase the total cost of the free-trade agreement.
Moreover, some Administration officials were concerned that what would begin as a temporary measure might become a permanent exception to President Clinton's goal of a single Federal program to help all Americans who lose their jobs to foreign competition, technological advances or other changes in the economy.
But in recent weeks Democratic supporters of the agreement have pressed the Administration to include a jobs program. The program may offer political cover against assertions by labor unions and Ross Perot that the pact would encourage American companies to relocate in Mexico, taking advantage of that country's low wages.
Mary Meagher, the press secretary for Mr. Reich, said that establishing an interim jobs program was necessary because of the busy Congressional calendar, which has forced the Administration to postpone until January its plan to seek legislation revamping current Federal jobs programs.
In last year's campaign President George Bush proposed spending up to $670 million a year to help workers who lost jobs because of the agreement but never said how he would pay for it. Ms. Meagher acknowledged that the Clinton Administration figure for the first year was smaller but pointed out that Mr. Bush did not call for a comprehensive job retraining program in the following years.
Nonetheless, labor unions were not impressed by today's $100 million proposal. "It strikes me as a Nafta Band-Aid," said Mark A. Anderson, the director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Task Force on Trade.
Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat who opposes the agreement, said the program was too small to affect the agreement's fate in Congress but acknowledged that the Administration faced a difficult choice. "If they come in with a large figure, they'll be acknowledging a lot of dislocation," he said. "If they come in with a low figure, then they're not doing much."
 
Plans to Raise Fees
 If approved by simple majorities of the House and Senate, the free-trade pact would gradually eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States.
The free-trade pact's elimination of tariffs would cost the Federal Government $2.36 billion in lost revenues over the next five years, Mr. Yerxa said today. He said the Administration wanted to raise Federal fees on travelers entering the United States by plane and ship but had not yet decided by how much.
 
Anger in Travel Industry
 Mr. Yerxa said "a very slight increase" in the fees would be needed. But he also said the free-trade agreement would cost $210 million in lost tariff revenues in 1994 rising to $612 million in 1998. By contrast, customs fees on arriving international passengers raised $180 million last year, he said.
The nation's travel industry has begun lobbying vigorously against the scheme in the last several days. "It's an outrage," said James E. Landry, the president of the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group here. "It would be a severe distortion of the user-fee concept."
Mr. Landry said dozens of bilateral air agreements with other countries barred the use of customs fees for any noncustoms purposes, but White House officials denied this, citing legal opinions by the State and Transportation Departments.
Today's hearings on Capitol Hill were the first of a complex series of actions by more than a dozen Congressional committees. The goal of the sessions is to produce a draft law by Oct. 31 to amend American law in hundreds of ways to make it consistent with the trade agreement.
Committee chairmen are scheduled to meet near the end of the month to settle differences between House and Senate drafts and then send a single document to the President, said Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee. The full House and Senate would not, however, vote on the draft bill.
The President would then resubmit it along with any changes as a so-called President's bill.

HEADLINE: 'Art' Is No Luxury

 BODY:
New York City is a difficult place to find an apartment, a cheap hotel room, a seat on the subway or, all too often, a moment's peace. But finding a theater, a museum, an art gallery, a dance group or a concert is a cinch. The city is up to its ears in the arts.
Last week the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey released a report that tells just what that extraordinary cultural concentration means to the metropolitan economy. It means jobs, lots of them, for New Yorkers -- and tax revenues for the city and state. 
 In 1992 the arts and other cultural activities in the metropolitan region generated almost $3.5 billion in wages, salaries and royalties, a 10 percent increase over the last decade. They were responsible for 107,000 jobs, ranging from starring on stage to making ballet slippers to catering for movie crews. And their total economic impact, counting expenditures by arts institutions, their suppliers, wage earners and visitors, generated 9.8 billion sorely needed bucks in the metropolitan area. Nearly 25 percent of that money came from tourists who said they had come to New York, or lengthened their stays there, to go to museums, galleries, theaters and concerts.
Some of what the arts bring to New York is impossible to quantify. The film makers who shot, in whole or part, more than 100 features there last year spent $168 million. But the public relations value of, say, the opening of Woody Allen's "Manhattan Murder Mystery" -- a magical nighttime city seen from above while Bobby Short sings "I Happen to Like New York" on the soundtrack -- are incalculable.
The Port Authority report makes no recommendations for subsidizing the arts at any particular level. But it contains more than enough hard figures to convince readers that the arts in New York feed a whole lot more than the soul. The arts are clearly a major economic sector, more so in New York than anywhere else in the country; their health should be treated with care.
But while Mayor David Dinkins has seen the wisdom of keeping the city's Cultural Affairs budget, which mostly supports nonprofit organizations, close to its 1990 high, Gov. Mario Cuomo has seen only the short-term gain of Draconian cuts. Three years ago, the New York State Arts Council's budget -- much of which comes to the metropolitan area -- was $54 million. Today it's $25 million -- and would be even less had the Legislature not restored $3 million that the Governor wanted out.
The state needs to take a second look at the adequacy of its arts funding. Would that the baseball fan who governs and who suggested spending $500 million on a new stadium in Manhattan were half as interested in keeping the arts in town.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Day Higher; Dow Up 10.06

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Cable and entertainment issues led the stock market higher yesterday in reaction to the proposed acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. by Bell Atlantic, which would be the nation's largest corporate merger ever.
Tele-Communications rose 3, to 31 3/8, while Liberty Media, which it hopes to reacquire, was up 2 5/8, to 29 1/4. Disney advanced 4 3/4, to 44 1/2, and Time Warner increased 1 7/8, to 41 7/8. Bell Atlantic itself rose 5 7/8, to 65 7/8. 
 Propelled by the big gain for Disney and a jump of 2 3/4 by Philip Morris, to 51 1/2, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,603.19, up 10.06 points. Both the Nasdaq composite index, which was up 6.51 points, to 778.97, and the American Stock Exchange market value index, which was up 5.35 points, to 475.85, set new highs.
"By closing above 3,600, the Dow may be ready to test the next resistance level between 3,610 and 3,620," said Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president of the Tucker Anthony brokerage firm. "It may even test the record closing high of 3,652.09."
Mr. Laubscher noted, however, that "the Nasdaq volume was more than 60 million shares higher than the Big Board volume." He added, "This is significant historically because it means that speculation is starting to run rampant and the market may be topping out."
 
Volume Climbs Sharply
 On the New York exchange, 291 million shares changed hands, substantially more than Tuesday's volume of 264 million shares. Declining issues narrowly outnumbered those that rose, 1,004 to 953.
Big broadcasters showed large gains, with traders focusing not only on the Bell Atlantic deal but on Monday's announcement that Westwood One was acquiring Unistar Radio Network from the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation. CBS was up 8 3/4, to 285 1/8, and Capital Cities/ABC was up 13 1/4, to 593.
With some analysts talking about the possibility of cigarette price increases, tobacco stocks were firm. In addition to Philip Morris, Loews -- which owns Lorillard -- advanced 1 1/4, to 92 1/2; American Brands rose 5/8, to 34 1/4, and RJR Nabisco increased 1/2, to 5 1/4.
Regional banks also showed gains after the Germantown Savings Bank of Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., announced that it had hired Alex. Brown & Sons to help it find a buyer. Germantown jumped 8 1/4, to 51 3/4, and some other smaller banks reached record highs.
Utility stocks declined and analysts cited the huge amounts that these companies would have to spend to meet clean-air requirements. Public Service Enterprises fell 1/4, to 33 7/8, and Con Edison dropped 1/4, to 35.
Also down for the day were the big international oil stocks. Texaco dipped 5/8, to 68 1/2; Mobil was off 7/8, to 83 3/8, and Chevron fell 3/4, to 95 1/8.
Semiconductor issues dropped on a trade association report that the industry's book-to-bill ratio -- the industry's main economic indicator -- declined in September, the lowest level since November 1991. Intel was off 1 1/2, to 63 1/2; National Semiconductor was off 1 5/8, to 16 7/8 ,and Motorola was off 3/4, to 102 3/4.
Pioneer Hi-Bred, the seed company, had an impressive gain of 4, to 37 1/4. Yesterday was its first day as a stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, replacing JWP Inc. The S.&P. index advanced 0.37 point, to 461.49.

HEADLINE: Whitman Goes on Attack, Accusing Florio on Funds

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
After a bruising week on defense, Christine Todd Whitman's gubernatorial campaign went on the attack today, charging Gov. Jim Florio with violating state election laws by spending money designated for the general election before the primary was held in June.
Speaking at a news conference at the State House, the Whitman campaign lawyer, Peter Verniero, contended that the Florio campaign spent or transferred $225,000 in general-election funds between April 9 and the June 8 primary. Ed Rollins, the campaign manager for Mrs. Whitman, said the suspected violation was significant because it allowed Mr. Florio to get a headstart on campaigning for the governor's race. 
 "I've heard of a lot of people trying to steal campaigns Election Day," Mr. Rollins said. "I've never seen anybody try to steal a campaign two months before it gets started."
Mrs. Whitman did not attend the news conference.
 
Hearing Requested
 The Whitman campaign said it filed a complaint with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission and asked for an emergency hearing on the allegations.
Frederick M. Herrmann, executive director of the election commission, said commission guidelines prevented him from commenting on whether a complaint had been filed.
But he said state law was clear on the matter. "A gubernatorial candidate may raise money during the primary for the general election, but the money cannot be spent during the primary election," he said.
Mr. Herrmann said the next monthly meeting of the commission is next Tuesday, but if necessary, the panel is prepared to meet in emergency session before then.
"Historically, the commission has dealt with gubernatorial election complaints expeditiously," he said.
A spokeswoman for the Florio campaign, Jo Astrid Glading, termed the allegations "nonsense" and called on the commission to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
"We don't think the commission will find a violation," she said.
Ms. Glading said that although the money was spent before the primary, it was not a violation because all of the expenses were general-election expenses. Mr. Florio was unopposed in the primary.
 
Spent on Raising Funds
 Ms. Glading said some of the money was spent for fund-raising activities. It is not illegal to raise money for the general election during the primary. The rest was used for items like rent, consultant fees, equipment rental and insurance, she said.
"The alternative would have been to write checks dated midnight June 8 and rush them over the next morning," Ms. Glading said, adding that "we don't think" the election commission "wants people to pay their bills late."
The standard remedy for an election-law violation is a fine -- $3,000 for the first offense and $6,000 for each subsequent offense of the same sort. "Beyond that," Mr. Herrmann said, "we would have to look carefully at the election statute to go beyond our customary fines."
The allegations came during a week in which Mrs. Whitman found herself repeatedly defending against attacks by the Florio campaign. First, Mr. Florio ridiculed Mrs. Whitman for saying during a debate last Thursday that tens of thousands of dollars were wasted buying Adidas sneakers for state prisoners.
Officials with the State Department of Corrections said the state does not buy Adidas sneakers for any inmate. Most prisoners get a pair of generic sneakers that cost $7 to $8, said Jim Stabile, a department spokesman. Inmates with medical problems diagnosed by a physician get special, high-arch sneakers that cost $34, he said.
Carl Golden, the Whitman campaign spokesman, said the candidate had been given faulty information by a state legislator.
 
Tax Returns at Issue
 On Tuesday, after blistering attacks by Mr. Florio and his chief political consultant, James Carville, Mrs. Whitman announced that she would release her family's 1990 income tax returns by the end of the week. Mrs. Whitman had already made public tax returns for 1989, 1991 and 1992. But she said at first that she saw no reason to release the 1990 tax return because she was a private citizen in 1991, when the 1990 return was being prepared.
Mr. Rollins, the Whitman campaign manager, said today's charges were not in response to the Florio campaign tactics. He said Mrs. Whitman decided to release the returns because she wants to get back to discussing important issues like jobs and the economy. And he said the charges against Mr. Florio were important because they point to the issue of integrity.
"This is a governor who will lie, cheat, do whatever it takes to win this election," Mr. Rollins asserted. "It goes to the arrogance of this administration."
The Whitman campaign also contended that Mr. Florio's campaign inappropriately transferred $308,700 to an account run by Democratic Finance '93, a joint campaign account of the Florio campaign and the Democratic State Committee's campaign.
Although the entity also filed a campaign finance report, Mr. Verniero, the Whitman lawyer, said mixing Florio campaign funds with money from the Democratic State Committee made it impossible to determine exactly how the Florio campaign funds were spent.
 
Cost of Clinton Visits
 Mr. Rollins also demanded the Florio campaign help pay for recent visits to the state by President Clinton and several top-level cabinet officials. White House officials maintain that a visit by Mr. Clinton on Oct. 8, as well as visits in September by Attorney General Janet Reno and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit, were official in nature and not politically related.
In 1990, Mrs. Whitman was fined $1,700 by the Federal Election Commission for a violation of Federal election laws. The commission said she failed to make a timely report of a $50,000 loan she made to her own campaign in the Senate race against Bill Bradley.
Mr. Verniero said Mrs. Whitman's 1990 violation was minor, compared with the allegations against Mr. Florio. "It's like comparing an elephant to a flea," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Aristide Move To Affirm Policy on Haiti

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
A day after an American troopship was forced to retreat in the face of a small mob on a Port-au-Prince dock, the Clinton Administration and the exiled Haitian President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, sought to demonstrate the United States commitment to the return of democratic rule in the Caribbean country.
"Our commitment to this process is unshakable," William Swing, the recently appointed Ambassador to Haiti, said today, referring to the negotiated settlement between Father Aristide and Haiti's military rulers that was supposed to lead to the Roman Catholic priest's restoration as President on Oct. 31.
 
Countering the Images
 Mr. Swing made his comments as he presented his credentials to Father Aristide at the Haitian Embassy in Washington. Advisers to Father Aristide invited the United States Information Service to record the event in hopes it would be broadcast to Haiti, where it might counter images of gun-toting police auxiliaries cheering on Tuesday as the American troopship retreated over the horizon. 
 Later in the day, President Clinton, meeting with a delegation from the Congressional Black Caucus, said he would soon make what one participant termed a "strong statement" in support of the return of the ousted Haitian President.
"He wants to bring this thing back on track," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of the Bronx, who attended the meeting at the White House.
As the Administration sought to maintain Congressional support for its policy toward Haiti, a policy that envisions the placing of lightly armed American soldiers and sailors in the country, one Administration official suggested that the raucous dockside demonstration that forced the retreat of a troopship carrying American and Canadian military personnel did not really constitute a threat.
 
'A Bit of Theater'
 "What happened at the docks I would continue to say was a bit of theater, a very effective bit of theater," said one official, who asked not to be identified. "It came at a point where it took on importance well beyond what it should have. And if you didn't have an international community focusing on Somalia and things of that nature, it probably never would have taken on the importance that it did."
Nevertheless, he said, "we had no choice" but to pull the ship out of Haitian waters.
"We were not going to force our way ashore," he said.
The ship, the Harlan County, was supposed to deposit 200 American and Canadian combat engineers and military trainers in Haiti. The military personnel are part of an international contingent of 1,300 who will help build roads, schools, hospitals and other projects and provide training for a reconstituted Haitian military and police force.
 
Trainers Could Stay for Years
 The Administration official said today that while the contingent of engineers would probably stay in Haiti for about six months, the military and police trainers could remain in the country for several years.
Mr. Swing is scheduled to take up his post in Haiti's capital on Friday, the same day that Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, leader of the Haitian military, and Col. Joseph Michel Francois, his chief of police, are supposed to step aside to make room for Father Aristide's return 15 days later.
At the ceremony, Father Aristide said, "With the deadline for the departure of Cedras, Francois and the high command only two days away, we hope that the international community will continue to stand with us to make that happen, so that true democracy will be restored to Haiti."
Administration officials say they hope that economic sanctions voted today by the United Nations Security Council would persuade Haiti's military and police commanders to step down as scheduled and place the process for Father Aristide's return back on track. In addition, the Administration is considering seizing the assets of individual supporters of the military junta.
In June the Administration froze the assets of 83 members of Haiti's economic elite in an attempt to bring pressure on the country's recalcitrant military leaders. Those sanctions were suspended along with United Nations sanctions in August after a new Prime Minister selected by Father Aristide took office.

Woolworth To Shutter 970 Stores

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
The Woolworth Corporation said yesterday that it planned to eliminate 13,000 jobs and close 970 stores, including half of its remaining five-and-dime variety stores, in what would be the largest, most costly reorganization in the retailer's 114-year-history.
The retrenchment will take place over several months and will include 400 of the discount stores and 330 Kinney shoe stores. The moves will further transform Woolworth from its Main Street dime store origins into a specialty retailing conglomerate. 
 The company said about 250 of the stores were expected to be converted to other formats like Foot Locker, Woolworth's highly successful athletic shoe and apparel chain, or the Bargain Shop, its chain of low-price apparel and household merchandise stores in Canada. Woolworth will cut 10,000 jobs in the United States and 3,000 in Canada, or 9 percent of its work force of 143,000.
 
 
Giving Up the Core Business
 "They've taken the hard decision to give up the core business that gave Woolworth its name," said Alan G. Millstein, editor of the Fashion Network Report. "The old-fashioned five-and-dime will be a memory."
 In a statement, Woolworth said it expected to take a $480 million after-tax charge against third-quarter earnings.
William K. Lavin, who became Woolworth's chairman in July, said third-quarter earnings were expected to fall sharply from a year earlier. In a five-week period that ended on Oct. 2, Woolworth's overall sales were off four-tenths of a percent, making it one of the weakest performers among the big retailers.
 
 
Unfavorable Conditions
 "The continuation of unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and Canada, along with increased competitive pressures affecting customers' shopping habits and the generally depressed environment, have led us to accelerate our store closings," Mr. Lavin said.
Woolworth said the stores to be shuttered had contributed 9 percent of the company's total revenue of $4.42 billion for the first half of the year. The stores lost $36 million in that period, the same amount the stores lost for all of 1992.
Shares of Woolworth rose 25 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $26.125.
The company did not say where the affected stores are situated. While about 450 five-and-dime stores will stay in business, most analysts expect they too will be tallying final receipts soon.
"I'd not be surprised if within three years, Woolworth will not have a Woolworth," said Isaac Lagnado, principal of Tactical Retail Solutions, a retail consulting firm.
Woolworth has been plowing its resources into specialty concepts, which generate twice the operating profits of dime stores, even as sales and profits at its central city locations have slowed. Woolworth's traditional customers have been lured away by discount mass merchants like Wal-Mart and Kmart, which typically have vast inventories and suburban locations that are viewed as safer and more accessible.
 Analysts said that long-term low-cost leases played a key role in supporting profit margins at Woolworth's five-and-dime stores and that they possibly masked the format's declining customer base. Woolworth closed 100 variety stores in 1992.
 
 
Shift to Specialty Chains
 In its efforts to transform itself, Woolworth has spawned a number of specialty chains, including Champs Sports, a sporting goods store; Northern Reflections, a women's outdoor apparel chain, and Foot Locker, which has been highly profitable.
But even specialty retailers like the Limited and the Gap have felt the pinch of a sluggish economy. And the grunge look has made heavy-sole leather shoes popular, dampening interest in athletic shoes.
Woolworth's largest previous housecleaning was the discontinuance of the 336-store Woolco discount department store chain, which led to a $428 million charge in 1983.

HEADLINE: HAITI JUSTICE MINISTER SLAIN IN DEFIANCE OF U.S. WARNING TO MILITARY TO KEEP PEACE

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Further defying international efforts to restore democracy in Haiti, gunmen shot and killed the Justice Minister and two aides this afternoon as they were leaving the minister's office.
The killing of the minister, Guy Malary, came less than two hours after radio stations here broadcast a warning by President Clinton that the United States would hold Haiti's military responsible for the safety of members of the transitional Government. The Cabinet was appointed six weeks ago by the ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 On a day of rising tensions, with Haitian soldiers and police officers staging an offensive of killings and threats, 51 Canadian police officers sent here by the United Nations left the country.
United States officials have said the 46 American military and police personnel in Haiti will be withdrawn Monday if the military does not insure their safety.
 
Violence Intensifies
 The Canadian withdrawal followed by two days the departure of a ship carrying 218 American and Canadian troops. Several hundred heavily armed demonstrators opposed to the return of Father Aristide had prevented the ship, the Harlan County, from docking, and the berth the military authorities had promised was occupied by another ship.
In response to the intensifying violence, the United Nations reimposed oil and trade sanctions on Haiti on Wednesday.
Since the troop ship sailed away, many diplomats here have warned that a newly emboldened Haitian military may step up its campaign of violence to avoid surrendering power.
 
Assigned to Retrain Police
 Despite repeated threats on his life by police auxiliaries, Mr. Malary, 50, had been one of the new Government's first senior officials to occupy his office shortly after their appointment by Father Aristide, who is in exile in Washington.
The minister, a respected and wealthy lawyer who was to have overseen the retraining of the police under a political accord reached last July, had quickly taken on dangerous work, insisting on the retirement of a Supreme Court justice favored by the Army.
In an interview Tuesday night, Mr. Malary said of threats against him after his removal of the judge: "I have come not to work with the justice establishment I've found on the ground. I've come with the intention of building something new that this country can be proud of."
According to people who arrived on the scene moments after the killings, the three bodies were lined head to toe in the road. Mr. Malary's wife arrived minutes later and removed his wallet and watch. As an ambulance arrived quickly to take the bodies away, armed civilians and police began chasing away by-standers and threatened to shoot news photographers at the scene.
The three killings set off a panic downtown, with shops quickly shuttered as the news spread and everyone from business executives to street merchants rushing to leave town.
The assassination occurred within a few feet of the spot where one of Father Aristide's most prominent supporters, Antoine Izmery, was dragged from a church service last month and shot in the head.
In addition to killing Mr. Malary, his chauffeur and his bodyguard, gunmen also occupied the National Assembly, briefly holding a small number of legislators and employees hostage.
 
Demand for New Talks
 According to local radio reports, the gunmen demanded that Father Aristide reach some sort of reconciliation with the Army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras. Under the terms of the political accord, which General Cedras signed, he is to retire from his command by Friday.
Another anti-Aristide group with strong ties to the military announced a national strike on Friday to show opposition to the international community's efforts to restore democracy. A similar strike last week was enforced at gunpoint as the police shut down the capital for the day.
The gunmen's attacks followed warnings earlier today by Army officers that imposition of the embargo by the United Nations, which is to take effect Monday, would bring the arrest of Prime Minister Robert Malval.
And late Wednesday, the Port-au-Prince police chief, Lieut. Col. Joseph Michel Francois, announced in a defiant message that he had decided "to stay and die in my country." Under the accord to restore Father Aristide, Colonel Francois is to resign and clear the way for a newly trained police force.
 
Accusing Americans
 Colonel Francois, who is widely believed to be the leader of a network of 1,500 brutal police auxiliaries known as attaches, charged that his life had been threatened earlier this month by United States diplomats, who warned him to leave the country.
Colonel Francois said he was preparing to release "material proof" of his assertions. Diplomats who met with him earlier this month denied ever issuing a death threat.
In an unusually blunt news conference today, the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, Dante Caputo of Argentina, denounced General Cedras and Colonel Francois, saying they were personally responsible for the violence afflicting Haiti and calling them "false nationalists and mafiosi."
Mr. Caputo said new sanctions on Haiti would be lifted only if the removal of the two men from power were accompanied by an end to political violence by the army.
On Wednesday the Security Council reimposed an oil and arms embargo that had been in effect earlier in the year. When first imposed, the sanctions dealt a blow to Haiti's economy. But many experts say such sanctions may be less effective this time, since Haiti is believed to have replenished its oil supplies and its leaders have moved and hidden their assets abroad.
 
The Reluctant General
 As the deadline for his resignation has approached, General Cedras has given some indications that he might not step down. In a news conference on Wednesday, he said he would resign only if a number of intermediate steps were undertaken first, steps he said were included in the political agreement.
Chief among these, he said, was a blanket amnesty for Army leaders for any crimes committed since the Sept. 30, 1991, military coup against Father Aristide. General Cedras also requested a forum to address the United Nations, and said Father Aristide had violated the settlement by failing to name a consensus government.
United States and United Nations diplomats both rejected General Cedras's demands, saying that a limited amnesty decreed by Father Aristide earlier this month was all that the negotiated agreements required.
A senior Western diplomat said today that the Army had "nothing to say about the composition of the Government, neither under the constitution nor under the agreement."
 
Diplomats Consult
 Mr. Caputo, the United Nations envoy, was seen shortly after Mr. Malary's killing speeding in his heavily guarded car toward the home of the United States charge d'affaires, Vicki Huddleston. No statement was immediately available from either diplomat.
A statement issued in Washington expressed grief at Mr. Malary's killing, calling him "a true champion of democracy."
The position of the Government of Prime Minister Malval has grown more tenuous as the United Nations has scaled back its presence here.
A dinner for Mr. Malval on Tuesday given by Senator Bob Graham of Florida broke up early when Mr. Malval's wife called to warn him that there had been shooting near their house.
Mr. Malval's home, which is guarded by a handful of soldiers who spend most of their time playing dominoes and by a small number of private security guards, has also been repeatedly threatened by the police auxiliaries.
"What we are engaged in is a psychological warfare," said a member of Mr. Malval's Government. "Cedras might want to try to get out by salvaging a little of his reputation somehow. Michel Francois has no reputation to worry about."

Jean-Bertrand Aristide: Haiti's first democratically elected President
 
Son of provincial landowner, studied with Roman Catholic priests in Port-au-Prince, became priest, gained prominence as outspoken critic of Duvalier dictatorship and subsequent military-backed governments. Escaped assassination attempts in 1987 and 1988, gained overwhelming victory in election for President in 1990, accused by opponents of violating constitutional rights while in office, governed for seven months before being overthrown by the military in September 1991.
 
Robert Malval: Prime Minister
 
Graduated from University of Miami and Institute of of Political Science in Paris, opposed most Aristide policies during his presidency, but began advising him this year in effort to stanch the country's economic devastation, chosen by Aristide to lead Haiti's transition to democracy, won international respect and that of much of Haiti's small middle-class population, but he has been unable to stop the political violence and kiilling or to disarm military-backed civilian gangs that are responsible for much of unrest.

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses for New Haitian Plan In Effort to Restore Ousted Leader

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Jolted by the assassination of Haiti's Justice Minister, Administration officials scrambled today to develop plans to salvage the stalemated effort to return to power the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Even before the killing in Haiti, the Administration was considering tighter sanctions against Haiti by the United Nations, freezing Haitian assets in the United States and perhaps sending American ships to enforce the cutoff of oil and arms, the officials said. 
 President Clinton indicated this morning that he would heed the advice of his Pentagon advisers and stop short of direct military intervention, but that option was nonetheless discussed by senior Presidential advisers who convened late this afternoon, after word of the killing reached Washington. Mr. Clinton joined the meeting toward its end.
No decision was made, and the President said nothing in public. A statement by the White House said he "strongly condemns" the killing of the Justice Minister, Guy Malary.
A senior Administration official said that there was a growing belief among the top ranks of the Administration that the agreement for restoring Father Aristide was dead, and that it would not be practical to send trainers and engineers to Haiti, as the White House had hoped. But the official said that no final decision on abandoning the plan was made at a late afternoon meeting of top Administration officials, and that they planned to reconvene on Friday.
 
New Problem, New Debate
 On a day that started with Mr. Clinton's declaration that he would stand by Father Aristide in spite of the intensifying violence in Haiti, Mr. Clinton found himself faced by mid-afternoon with a new debate about whether the United States should intervene in foreign conflicts.
Mr. Clinton said at a news conference this morning that sending troops to Haiti would violate the tenets of the Governors Island agreement, which provided for Father Aristide's return to power in exchange for a limited amnesty for the military leaders who ousted him.
"I would remind you that the Governors Island agreement basically was an agreement among all the major parties in Haiti which clearly set forth the fact that they did not want other countries' forces or a U.N. force coming in there to provide law and order," the President said.
That agreement was seen by the Administration as a way of ending the political crisis and thereby settling the issue of refugees who had fled Haiti to seek asylum in the United States, an issue that Mr. Clinton had vowed to resolve.
The slaying of the Justice Minister came just hours later, lending additional gravity to comments made by Mr. Clinton when he worried aloud about the safety of Haiti's new Prime Minister, Robert Malval.
 
Praise for Prime Minister
 "Malval is key to making this whole thing work," Mr. Clinton said. "He is recognized as a stabilizing figure, as a person who will work with all sides, as a person who will be fair to everybody. And it would be, again, a grave error to underestimate the extent to which this country regards him as an important part of the ultimate solution.
"I want to send a clear signal today, too, that the United States is very concerned about his ability to function and his personal safety and the safety of his Government."
Mr. Clinton said he would consider taking action if there was no progress made in carrying out the agreement, under which President Aristide is to return to Haiti by Oct. 30. He did not rule out sending ships to enforce the renewed sanctions against Haiti, saying only that he did not want to use the word blockade because it would connote an act of war.
The assassination raises the stakes for the United States, which earlier this week postponed plans to send 600 American and Canadian engineers and advisers to Haiti after an angry mob turned away the first troop ship.
"The people of Haiti would be sadly misguided if they think the United States has weakened its resolve," Mr. Clinton said.
 
Meeting at White House
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher met at the White House this afternoon with Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Anthony Lake, the national security adviser. Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said the President's advisers would eventually present him with options for action.
Kathleen deLaski, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said sending United States naval forces to cut off access to Haitian harbors remained a possibility.
"We're not sending ships anywhere to be part of what you describe as a blockade," she said. "We certainly reserve the right to take steps to insure that sanctions are carried out, but no operations are happening at this time or about to happen."
At his news conference, President Clinton offered a blanket defense of his Administration's foreign policy, arguing that recent events in Haiti and Somalia had vindicated his faith in the wisdom of involvement in trouble spots.
 
'Living in a New World'
 Asserting that his critics have found it "easy to second-guess" his foreign policy advisers, Mr. Clinton said his Administration should be given credit for its efforts to aid democracies in Haiti and elsewhere.
"We are living in a new world," he said. "It's easy for people who don't have these responsibilities to use words like naive, or this, that or the other thing. The truth is, we're living in a new and different world, and we've got to try to chart a course that is the right course for the United States to lead, while avoiding things that we cannot do or things that impose costs in human and financial terms that are unacceptable for us."
But two members of Congress who support Father Aristide called for tougher action against the opposition forces in Haiti.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, called on the United Nations to send troops from several nations to disarm the forces in Haiti. In killing Mr. Malary, Mr. Rangel said, "The thugs in Haiti have shown that they are not about to cooperate with the diplomatic measures being undertaken by the United Nations."
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that there should be an international ban on commercial flights to Haiti and that the United Nations should protect for the members of Haiti's transition government.
Michael Barnes, a Washington lawyer who is an adviser to Father Aristide, called the assassination "an absolute tragedy."
"I hope that Guy Malary didn't die in vain, and that his murder will be the galvanizing force to get the world community to demand that the Governors Island agreement be enforced," he said.
Officials of the Organization of American States said that a number of their human rights monitors in the country have been harassed by armed men in recent days.
 
Demonstration at O.A.S.
 On Wednesday morning, the officials said, a crowd of about 200 demonstrators, wielding machetes, gathered outside the headquarters of the O.A.S.-United Nations monitors' mission in Port-au-Prince and chanted, "Go Home!" An O.A.S. official said today that it would not send in any more monitors until the situation calmed down. There are about 100 rights monitors in Haiti now.
Forty-six members of a United States military team remain at a hotel in Port-au-Prince awaiting word -- expected by this weekend -- about whether they should return home.
Mr. Clinton warned about equating policies in Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. Any peacekeeping force sent to the Balkans would work because the troops would be controlled by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he said.

HEADLINE: House Rejects Democratic Leaders' Plan to Extend Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
In an embarrassing defeat for the Democratic leadership, the House of Representatives today rejected a plan to extend emergency benefits for workers who had been unemployed more than six months and had exhausted their state benefits.
Congressional budget rules require that the $1 billion cost of extending the benefits be offset by spending cuts or tax increases, but Democrats were deeply divided over where to come up with the money. 
 Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, had wanted to save $331 million to help pay for the extension by requiring immigrants to wait five years after their arrival, instead of three, to become eligible for Supplemental Security Income, a program for the disabled, elderly and blind.
But after strong opposition from the 15-member Hispanic caucus, the leadership instead proposed to save a similar amount of money by reducing the extended benefits from four months to three, a strategy that splintered the party's rank-and-file.
The leadership plan was defeated by a procedural vote of 274 to 149.
The fate of the unemployment bill now appears uncertain, and 60,000 unemployed workers who would become eligible for Federal extended benefits each week face a delay in their benefits. Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan and a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, said after the vote that the House would approve an extension of unemployment benefits "if the leadership can think of a political solution."
This would be the fifth extension of Federal unemployment benefits since Nov. 1991, when Democrats attempted to embarrass President George Bush by highlighting the troubled economy and making it appear that he had failed to recognize the problem. The last extension of unemployment benefits expired Oct. 2.
The vote followed a debate in which members pitted the needs of the jobless against the needs of immigrants. Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means committee, told the House, "This may well be your only chance to reduce the burden on taxpayers by reducing benefits for aliens."
But Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of upstate New York, told his colleagues that if they supported the leadership plan, "You'll be voting to take away employment benefits for workers to give welfare benefits to aliens."
 
Rostenkowski Forges Alliance
 Representative David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic Whip, exhorted the House: "Let us not pit the disabled, blind and elderly against unemployed people."
And Representative Jose E. Serrano, the Bronx Democrat who heads the Hispanic caucus, warned, "Any time you single out immigrants, you're going to have a problem with the Hispanic caucus."
But Mr. Rostenkowski, who persuaded 103 Democrats to join 171 Republicans in opposing the leadership bill, told the House that his original bill "does not single out any group of immigrants; it applies to all."
"A growing number of aliens are becoming public charges after three years, even though their sponsors are not poor," Mr. Rostenkowski said.
There are now 2.5 million people receiving state unemployment benefits, and an additional 1.4 million were receiving Federal emergency unemployment benefits, which expired Oct. 2d. Congressional experts said those whose Federal benefits expired before approval of the extension would not be eligible for the emergency benefits, which will expire Jan. 1st.
The bill would have extended unemployment benefits for seven weeks, except in four states and Puerto Rico, where unemployment is above 9 percent. In those states -- Alaska, California, Rhode Island and West Virginia -- benefits would be extended 13 weeks. The average benefit is $179 a week.

HEADLINE: U.S. Study Says Job Retraining Is Not Effective

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
An internal Labor Department report says the Government job training program for workers hurt by foreign trade is largely ineffective and used primarily as an income crutch for the unemployed.
The $200 million program, one of the biggest and most generous for unemployed Americans, was enacted 19 years ago in an effort to help laid-off manufacturing workers who could show that imports cost them their jobs. They were to be retrained in computer operation, nursing, accounting and trades like welding and air conditioning repair. 
 The Labor Department audit, based on an examination of 1,198 workers in nine states in 1991, found that only one in five of the retrained workers were steered into jobs paying at least 80 percent as much as their old jobs.
The findings were quickly cited by opponents of President Clinton's proposed North American Free Trade Agreement as evidence that the Government cannot easily make up for job losses by retraining workers.
 
Timing Is Coincidental
 The report, completed two weeks ago and now being distributed in Washington, followed the inspector general's normal schedule for audits and the timing was unrelated to current concerns about the economy, including the announcement by the White House yesterday of plans to provide special retraining for people who lose jobs because of the trade agreement. But it has landed in the middle of the debate over the trade agreement, on which Congress must vote before Jan. 1, when it is intended to take effect.
The audit says that half the eligible workers did not even enroll in training courses but that they still collected the unemployment benefits meant to support them while they were in school. The audit, which conducted its own survey, says it is hard for the Labor Department to monitor the program because no one -- in Washington or in the states, which administer it -- keeps track of the workers once they leave it.
In 1991, the largest number of participants were laid-off apparel workers. Most of the others worked in the auto, electronics and other manufacturing industries.
The program, established under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, costs about $200 million a year and covers about 30,000 workers. It provides up to 18 months of unemployment benefits, three times longer than the unemployed normally receive, so the workers will not have to drop out in the middle of their training because their benefits run dry.
"Briefly," the Labor Department's inspector general's office wrote, "we believe that the T.A.A. program fell short of meeting the re-employment or training goals implied by the act. The evidence collected shows that the program was managed as an entitlement-compensation program rather than a training program."
The audit dwells mostly on the management of the program and a failure to steer more workers toward training in new skills.
In a thorny aspect of the debate, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich frequently says that with training, workers will again find good jobs, but critics say the only jobs the economy is generating in any volume are relatively low-wage service jobs that require little training.
 
Problems Acknowledged
 The Clinton Administration, which has been critical of the training programs it inherited, did not try to defend this one. "The inspector general raises a number of problems with the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, which are essentially valid," said Douglas Ross, assistant secretary of labor for employment and training.
He said the Administration was overhauling the Government's unemployment-assistance and retraining programs and that the flaws found in the trade adjustment program would be removed in the new plan, to be introduced next year.
But he differed with the audit's suggestion that training did not lead to good jobs.
"Is the American economy or any Western economy creating as many good paying jobs as they would like?" he asked. "The answer is they are not. But can I find a decent job?" With appropriate training -- better than that many workers receive through the workers trade adjustment program -- "the answer is yes," he said.
Some Democrats in Congress, however, found ammunition for their opposition to the trade agreement in the audit.
 
'Programs Just Don't Work'
 "These training programs just don't work," said Representative Collin C. Peterson, the Minnesota Democrat who heads an anti-agreement caucus in the House. "They keep saying Nafta will create 200,000 jobs or something like that, but they can't tell us what those jobs are. How are they going to put together training for jobs when they don't know what they are?"
Mr. Peterson has scheduled hearings for Tuesday with Labor Department officials to question them about the audit. Representative Lynn Woosley, Democrat of California, has introduced legislation to provide up to three years of unemployment assistance to maintain workers' incomes while they train and look for other jobs.
Mr. Peterson's team found that the average participant in the program was male, 43 years old, finished the 11th grade, had worked for his previous employer for 10.6 years, earned $440 a week and was a member of a union. The 1,198 workers the auditors surveyed had been employed in Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
The audit determined that 80 percent of the workers had found jobs within a year after completing the trade adjustment program. While 80 percent of the job losers had worked for manufacturers, 57 percent found new jobs in manufacturing. Those who enrolled in training programs received an average of $13,134 in unemployment aid assistance, and those who did not obtain training received $10,775.
 
Results a Year Later
 It found that within a year of completing the program 62 percent of the workers, retrained or not, found new jobs, that 18 percent were recalled by their previous employers and that 20 percent were unemployed. Of those who found jobs a third settled for wages of less than 80 percent of their prior wages. They kept the jobs for an average of just eight months.
The audit said that 51 percent of the workers had enrolled in training programs and that these workers had done slightly better in finding jobs than those who did not. But it said only 19 percent of the retrained workers found jobs that required their training and paid at least 80 percent of their previous wages.

HEADLINE: New York City Sells Notes

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
New York City sold $650 million in tax-anticipation notes yesterday, featuring the first swap of competitively bid municipal notes to a variable rate.
The city saved about $175,000 by selling variable-rate notes with six-month rates near all-time lows, Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said in a statement. 
 The CS First Boston Group won the bidding on the $400 million fixed-rate portion of the notes. That portion, due on April 1, was priced to yield 2.45 percent, the underwriter said. The notes have a taxable equivalent yield of 3.83 percent.
Goldman, Sachs & Company won the bidding on the $250 million variable-rate portion of the sale. The notes will float against the Public Securities Association index, less 10 basis points. The rate will be reset every seven days.
After the sale, the city swapped the variable-rate portion of the notes with Goldman, Sachs for a fixed-income rate. The city got a rate of 2.37 percent, city officials said.

HEADLINE: Health Plan Is Now Seen as Less of a Deficit Fighter

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Acknowledging that its plan to overhaul the health care system will be more expensive than anticipated, the Clinton Administration has lowered its estimate of how much the plan would cut the budget deficit.
Several Administration officials said today that the plan would reduce the growth of the deficit by $70 billion to $80 billion between 1994 and 2000, down from the original estimate of $91 billion. 
 The new estimate comes at a time of intense political jockeying, when the White House is under pressure to demonstrate that its plan is credible. Indeed, Administration officials admit that it is hard to give precise predictions about how much money will be saved or spent in an overhauling the health sector, which represents one-seventh of the economy.
One reason for the lower estimate is that the Administration, recognizing that full savings will not occur until every state takes part, has concluded that some states will not be ready to join the program by Jan. 1, 1997, as it first anticipated.
These details emerged as the Administration rushed to put the finishing touches on the plan in the hope of giving Congress a formal legislative proposal late next week.
 
Battling Charge of Optimism
 The new estimates come after an intense round of number crunching, using what officials called conservative projections. They are intended to combat accusations by members of Congress and outside health care experts that the Administration's financial estimates are too optimistic.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget director, said today that the health plan would pare the deficit by $10 billion to $20 billion less than the $91 billion estimate. Another official, insisting on anonymity, said the deficit reduction would total "around 70 billion."
Under the revised plan, the Administration has decided to take back some of the gains that companies would realize from the proposal to have the Federal Government pay most health costs for early retirees. For the first three years, companies would have to repay to the Government half the money they save when the Government takes over most of their insurance costs for early retirees. From the fourth year on, companies would keep the full benefits.
 
Claiming Part of 'Windfall'
 "This is not a change in policy," said Christine Heenan, an Administration health-policy adviser. "These companies are experiencing a windfall, and we have always said there would be an assessment."
Administration officials have usually talked about a one-time assessment, not a three-year assessment. The new assessment was reported today in The Wall Street Journal.
Administration officials said the money would be used to offset losses in the Medicare and Social Security trust funds that are expected to result when the plan causes an increase in the number of early retirees.
The President proposed to lighten the corporate burden of paying for health insurance for retired people under age 65 because he was concerned that this burden was hurting the competitiveness of large manufacturers. At present, many large manufacturers pay the full cost of health insurance for early retirees, but the President has proposed that the companies pay 20 percent and the Federal Government pay 80 percent. This provision will cost between $4.5 billion $6 billion a year, Administration officials say.
 
Subsidies Balloon
 In preparing its new estimates, the Administration relied on its own forecast that inflation would be 3.5 percent a year through the year 2000. That is significantly higher than the Congressional Budget Office's 2.7 percent-a-year forecast that the Administration used in its original estimates.
By using the higher inflation figures, the Administration has concluded that the cost of subsidies would be considerably larger that anticipated. The Clinton plan calls for subsidies to low-income Americans and to low-wage companies with 50 or fewer workers.
One health care adviser estimated that the annual cost of subsidies would be about $90 billion a year, up from the previous estimate of $80 billion.
Administration officials also said they would probably alter their subsidy scheme for small companies. The President's plan would require these companies to provide health insurance, and the subsidies are intended to make it affordable to do so.
Some officials worry that the plan to subsidize low-wage companies with 50 or fewer workers would create some perverse incentives, like discouraging companies with 50 workers from expanding because they would lose their subsidies once they hired their 51st employee.
To alleviate this problem, the Administration is studying a phase-out of the subsidies. One idea is to reduce the subsidies gradually, starting with companies that have 30 workers, and phasing them out completely for companies with 50 workers. This phase-out would not increase the cost of the subsidy program, officials insist.
Worried that it might have underestimated the number of individuals and companies that receive subsidies, the Administration has increased the size of the financial cushion it has set up in case its estimates are too low. Officials said it had expanded its cushion so it represents 15 percent of estimated subsidies, up from 10 percent.
The Administration is having a hellish time estimating how many large companies would, to take advantage of the subsidies, contract out low-wage work, like janitorial work, to firms with 50 or fewer employees. If such contracting becomes widespread, the cost of subsidies could balloon.

HEADLINE: Breaking Down an Arms Buildup

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAGNA, Utah

 BODY:
Having earned billions of dollars building weapons for the military, many contractors think they have found a new growth area -- dismantling and recycling the weapons they were paid to make.
"If you are looking for someone to take things apart, the first guy you are going to look for is the guy who made them," said Steven Malevich, a marketing director for Alliant Techsystems Inc. of Edina, Minn., which makes bullets, cluster bombs and torpedoes. 
 For decades, the military discarded conventional weapons like bombs by blowing them up, burning them or dumping them in the ocean. But as environmental regulations slowly bring such practices to a halt, the Defense Department has turned to military contractors like Hercules Inc., which once turned out hundreds of missile motors here annually, to find sounder ways to dispose of explosives and other weapons, as well as to recycle their ingredients.
 
 
345,000 Deadly Tons
 The Defense Department is currently sitting on about 345,000 tons of bombs, bullets and other ordnance, enough to fill a convoy of tractor-trailers stretching from New York to St. Louis. The Government also has chemical and nuclear weapons and unfired missile motors that it wants to get rid of, and this arsenal of obsolescence is expected to grow substantially in coming years as the size of the military shrinks.
Experts can only guess at the ultimate cost of destroying old arms, but there is little question it will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. Nor is the United States Government alone in such initiatives. In July, Alliant Techsystems entered into a joint venture with the Ukrainian Government to dispose of 200,000 tons of ammunition, artillery shells and mortar rounds.
For weapons producers, the chance to recycle old arms will not greatly soften the blow of a sharp decline in military orders. But many company executives, seeking to convert their companies to a peacetime economy, are desperate for any opportunity to generate revenue.
Both Government and contracting officials said it was difficult to estimate the cost of recycling a specific weapon. Mr. Malevich of Alliant Techsystems said that tank artillery shells, for which the Government paid about $1,500 each, cost about $25 each to burn and would probably cost about $75 each to recycle.
 For their part, Government officials want to avoid some of the controversies associated with less sophisticated disposal techniques. Between 1988 and 1991, for example, the Defense Department destroyed more than 840 Pershing and ground-launched cruise missiles to comply with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The motors that powered the rockets were simply bolted down by military contractors in vacant fields and ignited, which spewed clouds of noxious fumes containing ozone-depleting chemicals.
"We all know that the use of open burning is suspect," said John Byrd, the chairman of the Joint Ordnance Commanders Group, which is coordinating Defense Department efforts to demilitarize obsolete ordinance.
Congress allocated $62 million in 1991 to finance research into better disposal methods, turning to companies that build rocket motors like Hercules Inc., the Thiokol Corporation and Gencorp. Other companies, including Alliant Techsystems and the Olin Corporation, began to look at sounder ways to get rid of bombs and artillery shells.
Here at the ghost-like Hercules plant near Salt Lake City, which now produces a fraction of the missile motors it once turned out, company researchers are looking at methods to take apart and recycle the solid-fuel motors. Essentially, the motors are made by pouring a mixture of chemicals that includes explosives into a case where it solidifies to the consistency of a pencil eraser.
The fuel, once cured, is virtually bolted to the casing. "This stuff beats the heck out of superglue," said Jerald Peterson, vice president for business development at Global Environmental Solutions Inc., a Hercules subsidiary formed in 1991 to specialize in demilitarization.
 
 
Ammonia and Liquid Nitrogen
 In one process being tested here, pressurized liquid nitrogen is used like a cutting torch to break the solid fuel into pieces. Hercules has also begun experimenting with using ammonia to dissolve the solid fuel into a liquid. The ammonia is then vaporized, leaving behind the fuel's initial ingredients -- including explosives.
"What you can do is sell some of the materials to offset the cost of recovering them," Mr. Peterson said, mentioning the mining, quarrying and construction industries.
Some companies have taken different approaches. The Aerojet division of Gencorp, facing strict environmental rules in California, started looking several years ago to find alternatives to open burning, said Joseph Biagioni, the company's director of resource recovery.
"We knew that sooner or later we would get tagged because this open-burn cloud could just drift off your property," he said.
So Aerojet developed a technique to use jets of water, exerting pressures of up to 10,000 pounds a square inch, to remove the fuel. Depending on the degree of the fuel's explosiveness, it can then be burned in an incinerator to produce energy or be processed back into ammonium perchlorate, a component of solid rocket fuel that can also be used in the production of paint or new fuel, Mr. Biagioni said.
In July, Aerojet made the first successful test firing of a Minuteman 3 rocket motor that used fuel containing recycled ammonium perchlorate. Aerojet executives and Nevada state officials have also discussed the possibility of building a plant to process 10 million pounds of obsolete explosives a year, Mr. Biagioni said. "At those processing rates, we can make it cheaper than burning," he said.
 
 
A Glut May Develop
 But the economics of recycling old weapons is far from proven. Like newspaper or plastics, there is likely to be a glut of commercial explosives as military contractors convert millions of tons of military ordnance to commercial applications. And because many contractors already produce explosives for commercial uses, they may wind up competing against themselves.
Some weapons may also prove impossible to recycle. Pyrotechnic devices intended to fool missiles by mimicking the exhaust of an F-16 jet, for example, emit a 3,000-degree burst when detonated. "There were a lot of items that were never designed to be taken apart," said Mr. Malevich of Alliant Techsystems.
 For more conventional weapons, like bombs and artillery shells, alternative disposal methods are being developed. Mr. Malevich said his company had developed a process that uses high-pressure jets of water to cut shells and casings into pieces. The metals can be recycled and the explosives, which are washed out of the shells, can be used commercially or to produce fertilizers or synthetic fuels.
"The Government believes it will cost about $500 a ton to demilitarize these shells and make them into bathroom fixtures," Mr. Malevich said.
Just when the Federal Government will begin such work is not clear. In the case of solid-fuel missile motors, Defense Department officials said they hoped to decide by 1995 on the best ways to dispose of and recycle them.
"The continental United States is now becoming a warehouse for weapons, and it is not something that you can abandon or walk away from," said Mr. Byrd of the Joint Ordnance Commanders Group.

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns North Koreans of U.N. Action on Nuclear Inspections

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency have warned North Korea that they will seek action by the United Nations Security Council unless Pyongyang admits inspectors to its nuclear sites within two weeks, according to officials in several countries.
For months the Clinton Administration has been trying to keep the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons out of the Security Council, in hopes that its direct talks with Pyongyang -- the first since the Korean War -- would derail its effort to build a nuclear bomb. But officials from South Korea and Japan, who have also been involved, now characterize the talks as an empty exercise that has allowed North Korea to buy time.
 
Equipment Not Serviced
 Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, which conducts the inspections, said that North Korea had repeatedly prevented inspectors from servicing equipment monitoring key nuclear sites. The equipment is expected to run out of film and batteries in November. 
 "We are coming up on something of a technical deadline, and North Korea has not been responsive at all," David Kyd, the spokesman for the atomic agency, said today. "At this point, we have no access to the sites at all."
South Korean and Japanese officials said they do not know if the Clinton Administration is ready to confront North Korea over its months of foot-dragging on the inspections.
 
'Sanctions Are the Last Card'
 "Economic sanctions are the last card, and no one wants to use it too early," a senior Japanese official who has been involved in the effort to persuade Pyongyang to end its project.
American officials said today that even if the issue is referred to the Security Council, there are a range of possible actions short of economic sanctions.
On Wednesday in Vienna, North Korean officials said they had broken off all dealings with the atomic agency, charging that it is biased and manipulated by the United States and its intelligence agencies. They said that they would deal directly with the United States in the future. The third round of American-North Korean talks, headed by Under Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, was postponed indefinitely in September after Mr. Gallucci said that North Korea had failed to live up to several of the commitments it made earlier.
 
Inspectors Harrassed
 Even after North Korea announced in March that it would pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it allowed inspectors from the atomic agency into the country. But in recent trips they have been harrassed and obstructed, at one point even forced to visit a key nuclear installation at night, by flashlight. They have never been permitted to conduct two special inspections of suspected waste dumps that could yield evidence of how much plutonium North Korea has produced from its nuclear waste.
The warning to North Korea was sent at a fairly low level, through a diplomatic channel recently established with North Korea's delegation at the United Nations. The United States still has no diplomatic ties with North Korea.
Until now, North Korea's willingness to let inspectors maintain the equipment was the one piece of evidence of minimal compliance with the international inspection system. That has faded quickly in recent months, as Pyongyang and the agency have repeatedly tangled over restrictions placed on inspectors.
Other negotiations have come to a dead stop. North Korea has not held bilateral talks with Japan since last November, and its talks with the United States have come to a halt since the summer. On Friday North and South Korea are expected to meet again to talk about "mutual inspections" in which both sides would send inspectors into the other's country.
If the issue went to the Security Council, the key player would be China. So far it has abstained from major resolutions criticizing North Korea, although it says it has joined in the effort at quiet persuasion. But the talks with the United States were partly an effort to demonstrate to China, North Korea's greatest remaining ally, that every effort was being made to negotiate a settlement.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up Only 0.2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Wholesale price inflation was unexpectedly low in September, and consumers continued spending at a brisk clip, Government reports showed today.
The news drove interest rates lower; the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 5.85 percent, the lowest in 25 years. [Page D14.] 
 Prices received by producers of finished goods climbed a modest two-tenths of 1 percent last month. But wholesale inflation would have been nonexistent had it not been for a jump in food prices, which move erratically and were affected by the summer's floods and drought.
Retail sales were also better than they appeared at first glance. Over all, sales rose a slender one-tenth of 1 percent, but excluding the automotive sector, which experienced some unusual factors in September, retail sales rose six-tenths of 1 percent in the month. Receipts from car sales were depressed by larger-than-usual price discounting to liquidate stock at the end of the model year, economists said, a development that also restrained the rise in producer prices.
 
More of the Same
 Taken together, said William V. Sullivan Jr. of Dean Witter Reynolds, the results "confirm the moderate-growth, low-inflation environment" that has prevailed all year.
Still another report today showed that first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose 8,000, to 329,000, last week, with nearly a third of the increase in Pennsylvania. Some analysts had expected the latest Labor Department tally to show a larger increase to reflect workers whose extended emergency benefits had run out and who might instead have filed under the regular program.
But the four-week moving average of claims, which economists consider to more accurately reflect the true trend, edged up only slightly, to 330,000, from a four-year low average reported last week.
So far this year producer prices have risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of eight-tenths of 1 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent gain in 1992. The modest rise in overall producer prices in September followed three months of declines.
 But analysts expressed confidence that the slight September rise did not represent a revival of inflationary pressure. Among other things, they pointed to the fact that the finished-goods index had risen only five-tenths of 1 percent the last 12 months and that prices also remained in check at earlier levels of production.
Intermediate goods, like a bolt of cloth, rose just one-tenth of 1 percent last month, while crude goods, like a bale of raw cotton, fell four-tenths of 1 percent. This meant there was nothing worrisome that might show up in coming months in finished goods -- the level at which products are ready for sale to the final business or individual user.
The producer price gauges, however, exclude most services and imported goods. These are included in the Consumer Price Index, which the Labor Department will release on Friday and which is expected to show another modest increase.
Wholesale food prices rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in September, with higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables, pork, beef and veal, cheese, poultry and processed fruits and vegetables, the department said.
Tobacco products rose 2 percent after a plunge of 25.6 percent in August, while books and women's apparel turned up. Prices of passenger cars tumbled six-tenths of 1 percent -- 3.4 percent before adjustment for recurring seasonal patterns -- after a 1 percent August increase.
The Labor Department attributed the decline in car prices to liquidation allowances granted to dealers by auto makers.
Finished energy goods were unchanged last month after hefty drops in July and August. And prices of capital equipment, which rose in most earlier months this year, were also unchanged.
The Commerce Department's report on retail sales, showing a one-tenth of 1 percent overall advance for September, required a bit more interpretation than usual, but analysts generally concluded that spending remained on a solid, though restrained, upward trend.
Not only did liquidation allowances lead to lower showroom prices for cars, they noted, but car sales -- only mediocre for the month -- were thought to have been hurt at least as much by a shortage of desirable models as by slack demand. Moreover, car sales perked up in the first 10 days of October.
Today's report also doubled the previously reported average sales gains for July and August, with each month now showing an advance of five-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Cool-Weather Bump
 On the other hand, sales of apparel and possibly other goods seemed to benefit last month from cooler-than-usual weather, with the result that some business might have been "stolen" from October.
Reversing the August pattern, nondurable goods like clothing advanced eight-tenths of 1 percent in September while durables like cars fell 1 percent.
Sales climbed 2.1 percent at merchants that sell apparel and accessories, 1 percent at stores that sell general merchandise, eight-tenths of 1 percent at drug and proprietary stores, seven-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars and three-tenths of 1 percent at gasoline stations. Sales at food stores, however, eased two-tenths of 1 percent.
Among durables, the drop for automotive dealers was 1.8 percent, while those selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes posted a 1.2 percent sales decline. Bucking this trend, however, was a 1.9 percent jump in sales of furniture, home furnishings and equipment.
At $174.45 billion, retail sales last month were 6.1 percent ahead of the September 1992 level without adjustment for inflation.

HEADLINE: Teachers Union's Crucial Alliance With Dinkins Is Shattered

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
When Mayor David N. Dinkins was running for office four years ago, the powerful teachers union and its president, Sandra Feldman, broke a 12-year tradition of silence and endorsed him early, then worked hard for him as he eked out a narrow victory.
When he gave the teachers a large pay increase that first year in office, despite a worsening fiscal picture, many saw it as a reward. 
 That pay increase ushered in a period of both political and fiscal problems for Mr. Dinkins, and when he demanded that the unions give back part of the raise, one of the most important political alliances in town began to unravel.
Now the relationship -- once a symbol of the powerful partnership between the Mayor and the labor movement -- is in tatters, the victim of personal animosity between Ms. Feldman and the Mayor's staff, teachers' anger over chaos in the schools, and a feeling among the union's leaders and members that despite all the heat he had taken, Mr. Dinkins had not come through for them in contract talks.
 
Dinkins's Appeal Snubbed
 On Wednesday, turning aside a personal appeal to Ms. Feldman from the Mayor's campaign manager, Bill Lynch, the union's 3,000-member delegate assembly decided not to endorse anyone this year, directly repudiating Mr. Dinkins.
Union officials say the decision reflected a divided union membership and widespread frustration over what they see as punitive spending cuts of more than $700 million from the school system's budget.
Teachers are an important swing voter group in the mayoral election. The union's members are about a third minority, a third Jewish and a third white Roman Catholic, according to a union survey a few years back, and they have traditionally been considered been more liberal than other voters.
"There were people working for the Mayor who cut the school system more than they did other areas," said Ms. Feldman. "The Mayor trusted their judgments, but from our perspective they were out to hurt the schools. I wonder if they had the Mayor's interests at heart."
Or, as Mary Esterlyn White, a math teacher at Martin Luther King Jr. High School on the Upper West Side, put it: "He owed us. The last time he ran we made a difference in a way. He made us sweat. Make him sweat. I think Giuliani is a worse choice, but I think Dinkins shouldn't get off easy."
Behind the shift is Mr. Dinkins's transformation from a fresh challenger to a veteran incumbent, with the extra political baggage of a prolonged recession in the city, which has made it difficult for the union to act.
And mayoral aides and officials in the union movement say that the union's decison not to endorse the Mayor reflects a feeling of misunderstanding and betrayal over a two-year dispute over a new teachers contract.
 
'Perception' Criticized
 Leland T. Jones, a spokesman for the Mayor, said that schools had been cut less than parks and sanitation and other agencies -- when measured against spending plans. He said actual spending increased by $700 million in the last four years.
"There is perception out there, in large part fed by any number of political opponents of the Mayor who have been ignorant of what the real facts are," he said. "The Mayor supports the schools, but he also supports other services, including public safety."
To be sure, Mayor Dinkins will likely have the support of the largest municipal and private unions -- almost all unions outside the Police and Fire Departments -- with hundreds of thousands of members and well-organized phone banks to get out the vote.
But even as they roll out the campaign machinery, some of his supporters in the labor movement say their enthusiasm has waned over four years. This time, they say, the unions can deliver their members to the polls, but cannot necessarily tell them whom to vote for.
"He has made mistakes," a prominent union leader supporting the Mayor said. "Obviously there are things that I would have liked him to do differently, that he would have liked to have done differently. But Ed Koch took a long time to learn the business, and I look forward to a stronger Dinkins in the second term."
Ted H. Jacobsen, the secretary of the New York City Central Labor Council, said, "We are hot and heavy in this campaign and so are most of our affiliates." He said that the economic distress cited by Mr. Giuliani in his attacks on the Mayor is "nationwide and international. It is not just unique to David Dinkins."
Four years ago, the United Federation of Teachers, with 120,000 teachers, teachers' aides and other school workers, endorsed Mr. Dinkins in the midst of a hotly contested Democratic primary, helping him to be recognized as a serious contender.
At the time, Ms. Feldman said, many teachers were fed up with the Koch administration, which they "perceived as being hostile to teachers."
The honeymoon with the Dinkins administration ended after it reached a one-year contract with the teachers in September, 1990, in a deal that was roundly attacked by the editorial boards and the city's outside fiscal monitors. It also contributed to a sell-off of the city's bonds.
Teachers were soon threatened with up to 8,000 layoffs and forced to postpone $40 million worth of wage increases into the 1990's. Ms. Feldman said that the Mayor's staff and his budget director punished the school system for the settlement through damaging cuts that hurt teachers and students in the classroom.
Then the union went for two years without a contract, and reached a settlement that did not give teachers much more than other unions had received.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Investor's Dreams Rise From Decay

BYLINE: By Charles Strum

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
MILES P. BERGER has just bought one of the biggest empty buildings in Newark. Soon he will take possession of the one next door. Then Mr. Berger will have two large empty buildings, only a fraction of the city's ample inventory.
But skeptics who think he has stumbled into the urban equivalent of investing in swampland should think again. Mr. Berger and his partners may be conspicuous in their daring, but they are not greenhorns. They know Newark wants to promote, at almost any cost, the physical transformation of a distressed city that produces too little tax revenue. 
 They also know what's taking shape just across Broad Street: the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the state's $200 million response to Lincoln Center.
"Location, location, location," said Mr. Berger, reciting the real-estate developer's mantra and emphasizing three points.
One: All highways, railroads and flight paths in New Jersey lead to Newark, the state's largest city.
Two: The larger of his two empty buildings, the former Hahne's department store on Broad Street, had the best location in Newark when it was built in 1901, and it will again.
Three: The arts center, with a 2,700-seat concert hall and a 500-seat theater, is scheduled to open in 1995, and so is No. 609 Broad Street, the former Hahne's.
"It's no accident that Hahne's decided to build there," Mr. Berger said. "This is truly the center of Newark."
The Berger Organization -- Miles, his brother, Bruce, and his cousin Sol -- paid $2.5 million for the Hahne's building, a four-story pile of brick and limestone with an architectural style that can only be called fin de siecle mercantile. Each floor, a forest of support columns, is nearly two football fields in size. A skylight obscured by tar paper and the four-floor atrium it illuminated will be uncovered to brighten customized office space. Retail shops are planned for the first floor. The basement will accommodate 150 cars. Cost of the renovations: $25 million.
Next door, the 15-story Griffith Piano Company building, acquired at a tax auction, will provide more office space, and its recital hall will be reborn as a nightclub or theater. "A place to go after the concert," Mr. Berger said. "This is a project that will invite people outside and over here."
But "over here," a short stroll across Military Park, is the city center that did not hold, as the middle-class exodus and poor economy vacuumed commerce from its once-thriving core. Macy's finally abandoned its 16-story building on Market Street last year, joining a long and dispirited caravan of merchants who led the way out of town in the 1960's and 70's. Hahne & Company, founded here in 1858, closed its doors in 1986.
Mr. Berger is betting this will change, the way that Lincoln Center and other urban renewal projects on the Upper West Side of Manhattan helped reclaim neighborhoods and promote commerce, a process that began in the 1960's just as Newark's retreat became a rout.
That's a long time to wait, even for a methodical investor like Mr. Berger, whose company successfully restored the landmark Robert Treat Hotel and the handsome 1920's Firemen's Insurance Company building, just a brief stroll from his Broad Street buildings.
In the short run, Mr. Berger said he would do what seemed to work best in a city where private investment still relies on public money: he will seek tenants from county, state and Federal agencies, which have helped stabilize the rental market here. He will also take advantage of a tax-abatement program that has so far proved a double-edged sword for Newark and the restoration program it calls its renaissance.
Abatements have helped cultivate a swath of glass-walled office towers on the eastern edge of the original business corridor. The result is a trade-off: a patina of urban prosperity, but a citizenry still yearning for education, jobs and amenities that wealthier places take for granted.
Among these are retail stores, an endangered species here, despite the thousands of potential shoppers who fill the new office towers.
"Many of the buildings have retail shops built up inside them, connected to over-the-sidewalk bridges," Mr. Berger said. "Those bridges are to keep people off the sidewalks. When they're keeping you in, you're not going to be on the street."
The intent of the arts center -- and by extension, his own projects -- is "getting people walking on the sidewalk,"
"People with dollars in their pockets, ready to spend," he said.
But ruminating on the future, the man with two big empty buildings must pause occasionally for a reality check.
"I start to feel crazy when I see that there's no competition out there," Mr. Berger said. "Sometimes I think no others are seeing what I see happening."

HEADLINE: Enclave Outgrows Its Racial Tensions

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Nina Gennaro Suarez remembers when the glow of Ebbets Field's lights danced on her bedroom wall and the roar of Brooklyn Dodger crowds rolled over her neighborhood. She wistfully recalls the Saturday morning "kiddie shows" at the old Patio Theater on Flatbush Avenue.
And she will never forget the brick that came through a window of her house on Rutland Road after her father refused to join with neighbors demanding that he help buy out the first black family on the block. That was in 1949. 
 Much has changed since then in Lefferts Manor, an eight-block tree-lined enclave south of Crown Heights and east of Prospect Park that is celebrating its centennial on Sunday. Threaded like a cable through its history is a covenant that has held the economic structure of Lefferts Manor in place. Written into the original deeds, the covenant forbids the construction of "any building other than a private dwelling for one family."
To be sure, Lefferts Manor is not the place it was when the heirs of Pieterse Lefferts -- who was granted the land by Peter Stuyvesant in 1661 -- carved up a piece of their vast farmland to build stately Victorian homes for Brooklyn's well-to-do.
Today the neighborhood of 600 homes is a middle-class stronghold. Three-fourths of the families are black, and the racial tensions that resulted in the construction of "hate fences" and in white flight in the 1950's and 60's in Lefferts Manor have long since been overtaken by a spirit of community.
Paul Skrobela, a real-estate agent for the William B. May Company, has sold 30 of the approximately 50 houses that have been bought in the community in the last decade. He estimated that 11 of those homes were bought by black families, 11 by whites and 8 by interracial couples.
When residents gather on Sunday for a street fair and house tours, they will have much to look back upon, though, like intense growing pains, not all of it easy to bear.
"Few neighborhoods have covenants like ours," said Stephen McGill, 41, president of the Lefferts Manor Association. "It helped us maintain a middle-class community" since the turn of the century, when the going price for a home was $5,000. The current average market value is $250,000, Mr. Skrobela said.
 
A Landmark District
 In 1960, the covenant was given legal teeth when the city zoned this niche of Brooklyn for single-family homes. Lefferts Manor's standing was further enhanced in 1979 when the mixture of neo-Georgian, late Romanesque, Federal and Tudor homes was declared a landmark district.
Mr. McGill, who is black, said that "for the most part, the black people in the neighborhood would agree that the covenant has been a positive factor." But, he added, "There are older people on my block who remember how isolated they felt back then."
Back then was the 1950's, when George and Almeida Holmes, seen by some as intruders in an all-white preserve, challenged the covenant. After they advertised for boarders, the Holmeses were taken to court by the neighborhood association.
John Petito, a lawyer and historian who wrote his master's thesis on the litigation surrounding the covenant, placed particular blame on real-estate agents. "You had your blockbusters telling them, 'You can divide your house up,' " he said. "They said a covenant is no longer effective if the neighborhood changes."
From the surrounding area, clergy and citizens nursing the seeds of conscience that would become the civil-rights movement formed the Holmes Defense Committee. One of their pamphlets declared of the case: "It is a bare-faced attempt to drive them out of the neighborhood. The same weapon may be used against any others whom these bigots may choose to drive away."
The validity of the covenant was upheld in State Supreme Court in 1950. But the racial animosity shown toward black families during the 1950's endured. Many longstanding families chose to isolate themselves.
 
Hate Fences
 "We used to call them hate fences -- those high, corrugated plastic things," said Donald Wynne, 57, whose family arrived in 1958. "Rather than give you any verbal abuse, the fence would say, 'You're here, but I don't have to look at you.' "
Other white families moved away, but some embraced the change.
"There was a strong handful that stayed, that said, 'These are family people moving in and they want for their families what we want for ours,' " said Mrs. Suarez, who has lived here all her 55 years. "My father was Sicilian. He bought this house in 1919. And even though he was a surgeon, as far as a lot of people around here were concerned back then, he was still from Pigtown -- that's what they called the Italian section beyond Nostrand Avenue. So he wasn't about to turn up his nose at anyone else."
When the petition to buy out the Holmeses came around, she recalled: "My parents refused to sign, and my neighbors refused to sign, a whole string of houses. Then, over a period of five, six months, there were bricks coming through your windows, people on the roof at night. Then it stopped."
 
Learning to Get Along
 Even though the antipathy toward newcomers did not vanish -- the Holmeses moved out in 1955 -- a sense of calm returned to the streets.
"People learned to get along," Mr. Wynne said. "Bear in mind, back in the 60's, we had a whole revolution; a more enlightened person moved in."
Lefferts Manor, which shares the 71st Precinct with Crown Heights and is buffeted on its borders by the urban ills of poverty and crime, remains a pocket of peace.
"It's a vibrant, mixed neighborhood," said Inspector Anthony Marra, commander of the 71st Precinct. Crime statistics, he said, are not kept separately for Lefferts Manor, "but the incidence of serious violent crime is relatively lower in this area where the people have a vested interest, pride in their community."
As part of the celebration, the association has set up an exhibit at the old Lefferts Homestead, a white clapboard farmhouse in nearby Prospect Park. It includes photographs and statements of residents taken by Andrew Strawcutter, who lives on Midwood Street.
The quotation under the photo of Betty Frumkin, who lives on Maple Street, says: "I love raising my kids in the neighborhood. They are tolerant of all kinds of people."
The hate fences are lore and have long since been dismantled. Renovations are now more inviting.
"We have a flower-barrel planting project with over 350 flower barrels on the streets," said Mary Miller, who publishes The Manor Echo periodically to promote community unity.
Mrs. Suarez -- who confesses to sneaking into the old Patio Theater with the Skelton girls, who were black, and the Strauss kids, who were Jewish -- said: "Our little enclave is great. If you don't like your neighbor, it's because he's a lousy neighbor."

HEADLINE: Giant Deal Continues to Drive Up Stocks

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Stocks moved strongly upward for the second consecutive day yesterday, with much of the impetus again from the huge proposed acquisition of Tele-Communications by Bell Atlantic.
"The strength of the market was primarily in the Baby Bells," said Edward Nicoski, managing director of Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "That's because of prospects that we are going to see more combinations of cable companies and telephone companies." 
 For example, Southwestern Bell was up 3, to 43; Ameritech 3 3/8, to 87 1/8, and U S West 2 1/8, to 49 5/8.
Even smaller media-related companies participated in the euphoria. Electronic Arts rose 2 1/4, to 41 1/2, and Acclaim Entertainment increased 7/8, to 29 1/2.
As for the two companies in the merger, Bell Atlantic, the sixth-most-active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, climbed 1 3/4, to 67 5/8, while Tele-Communications advanced 1 1/2, to 32 7/8.
Traders were also influenced by evidence that inflation remained under control. A Government report that September wholesale prices edged up only two-tenths of a percent prodded a rally in the bond market, where the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.85 percent, a 25-year low.
The lower interest rates led all the big stock market averages higher. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 18.44 points, to 3,621.63, and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, the Nasdaq composite and the Amex index all closed at highs.
Volume soared still higher on the Big Board, reaching 352.5 million shares, compared with 291 million shares on Wednesday. Advancers topped decliners, 1,162 to 913.
 
Strong Consumer Issues
 Another sector that demonstrated strength yesterday, as it has for the last couple of weeks, was consumer nondurables. Thomas McManus, a strategist for Morgan Stanley, said that his firm's consumer stock index had increased 4.4 percent since Sept. 30.
"Consumer-oriented growth stocks are strong," he added. "This market is being driven by the 1993 laggards."
Among those he cited were Coca-Cola, up 2, to 44 1/8; Procter & Gamble, up 2 1/4, to 52 1/4, and General Mills, up 4 1/8, to 64 7/8.
Automobile issues were another market standout, after a report on Wednesday that sales of cars and light trucks climbed in early October to the highest point since the summer. Chrysler, which reported unexpectedly robust third-quarter earnings yesterday, jumped 3 1/4, to 51 3/4, while Ford Motor gained 2 1/4, to 57 1/2, and General Motors rose 1 1/8, to 44 3/4.
One of the weakest parts of the equity market, however, was the financial sector, with banks hit hard over earnings concerns. Citicorp fell 1 1/4, to 38 3/8, on heavy volume of three million shares. Wells Fargo fell 5 3/4, to 125 7/8; Chemical Banking declined 1, to 45 1/8; J. P. Morgan dropped 3/4, to 77 3/4, and Banc One lost 7/8, to 42 5/8.
And a couple of stocks that had disappointing earnings also notched declines. Cooper Tire dropped 4 1/8, to 20 3/4, and Walbro fell 2 7/8, to 26 3/8.

30-Year Bond's Yield Hits New Low

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to a new 25-year low yesterday.
But that new low -- 5.85 percent -- was just below the old one of 5.86 percent. As such, yields will need to drop even lower to confirm that the rally at the long end of the bond market has resumed. 
 Confirmation could come today when the Labor Department releases the Consumer Price Index for September.
The consensus forecast for the Consumer Price Index, according to Bloomberg Business News, is a moderate increase of two-tenths of 1 percent. If that is the increase, the index will have risen at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first nine months of the year, just below the 2.9 percent pace for 1992.
 
 
New Lows Seen
 Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for Technical Data in Boston, said if the Consumer Price Index number came in as expected, the market should "blow through" to new lows.
She said this did not happen after the release of the Producer Price Index yesterday, which rose two-tenths of 1 percent in September, because the September Consumer Price Index number was still unknown and because the August Consumer Price Index surprised the market with a three-tenths of 1 percent increase after it was reported that the Producer Price Index fell six-tenths of 1 percent.
Reflecting this caution, the market made just one big trading move yesterday, with prices rallying quickly and yields, which move in the opposite direction, falling immediately after the release of the Producer Price Index. At the same time, the Commerce Department said that retail sales gained one-tenth of 1 percent in September.
While the jump in the Producer Price Index was the first in five months, it was in line with market expectations. And combined with the retail sales data and the September employment report of last Friday, it seemed to indicate that the environment of low inflation and sluggish economic growth, which the bond market has thrived on, would remain unchanged for some time.
In late trading at 5 P.M., the price of the 30-year bond was up 30/32 point, with the yield down from 5.91 percent Wednesday. The yield hit 5.86 percent on Sept. 8; since then it has jumped as high as 6.12 percent.
 
 
10-Year Note
 The yield on the 10-year note, which is an alternative measure of long-term interest rates, also inched down to a new 25-year low. The price of the 10-year note was up 14/32 with the yield falling to 5.21 percent, from 5.26 percent the day before and from the previous 5.22 percent low.
But yields of issues with shorter maturities were still above their recent lows. They have been locked in a tight trading range because market analysts expect that the Federal Reserve will not change its short-term interest rate target, which has been 3 percent for more than a year. Without the expectation that the Fed will cut its interest rate target, it is unlikely that short-term rates will hit new lows.
In trading yesterday, the yield on the two-year note fell to 3.79 percent from 3.81 percent. Its 1993 low was 3.69 percent on Sept. 3.
Dennis Bushe, a managing director and strategist at Prudential Investment Advisors, said that if the moderate level of prices increases reflected in the Producer Price Index were confirmed in the Consumer Price Index, the yield on the 30-year bond should be pushed into a new trading range, with a low of 5.5 percent and a high of 6 percent.
He said long-term yields should also be pulled lower by the lack of supply of new 30-year Treasury bonds. Because the Treasury has decided to cut the annual issuance of 30-year bonds by about 40 percent, no new bonds will be sold until February.
"These are the issues that make the fall look strong in the bond market," he said.
Ms. Kimelman of Technical Data said that the inflation report "does not suggest that there is any reason to worry about price pressures down the road."
 
 
'Too Soon to Get Excited'
 On the pace of economic growth, she said that the retails sales data, while weak, reflected a little more spending by consumers. There were upward revisions in July and August, while September came in at a weaker-than-expected one-tenth of 1 percent increase. "We are seeing consumers open up their pocketbooks a bit, but it is too soon to get excited about any consumer-led burst in the fourth quarter of this year or even the first quarter of next year," she said.
Some corporate treasurers have seemed to be betting this week that long-term interest rates are near their lows by selling several issues of 50-year and 100-year bonds.
This is the second time this year that there has been a flurry of 50-year and 100-year debt sold in one week. The last one came in mid-July. If the selling of such debt is a signal that companies are betting that interest rates have hit bottom, then the last sales were not well timed. In the interval since Walt Disney and Coca-Cola sold 100-year bonds, the yield on the 30-year bond has dropped from 6.66 percent to yesterday's 5.85 percent.
Following are the results of the Treasury auction of one-year notes yesterday:

Purchases by Bank of Japan Said to Help the Dollar Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday in technically driven trading after the Japanese central bank reportedly bought dollars to support the United States currency.
In late New York trading, the dollar jumped to 107.32 Japanese yen, from 105.92 yen Wednesday. It also rose to 1.6125 German marks from 1.6015 marks. 
 The dollar started to rise against the yen during Tokyo trading. Traders said the Bank of Japan bought dollars after the currency came under pressure because of published comments by Treasury Under Secretary Lawrence H. Summers that were interpreted as favoring a higher yen.
The rise of the dollar continued in London trading, as it breached several technical levels against the yen, touching off further dollar buying.
Traders were mixed on whether data released yesterday on United States retail sales and inflation in September helped the dollar's rise. Retail sales edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, while the Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent.
Ken Gettinger, head of foreign exchange at the Union Bank of Switzerland's New York office, said the data were better than expected.
"The anticipation had been on the down side, and people were short," he said, referring to investors who had sold dollars they did not own, expecting the currency to fall before they had to pay for it. When the dollar rose, they had to buy it to cut their losses.
 
Rises Against Other Currencies
 The dollar gained against other currencies on the back of its climb against the yen, traders said.
European currencies continued to slide against the German mark. Frank Pusateri, a vice president at the Bank of Boston, said investors were expecting several European countries to lower interest rates. While that would stimulate their economies, it would mean less return on investments in those currencies. That, in turn, would lower the value of the currencies.
"The market is voting with its cash flow," he said, adding that investors thought the rate cuts were overdue in recession-bound countries.
The British pound also lost ground, falling in New York to $1.5157, from $1.5225 on Wednesday.

Silver Tumbles on Reports Of Slow Economic Growth

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver prices fell sharply yesterday as low inflation and slow economic growth killed the appetite of investors for precious metals.
Gold prices also retreated. 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for December delivery fell 8.5 cents, to $4.348 an ounce; December gold sank $1, to $366.60 an ounce.
Silver had risen by 38 cents, or about 9 percent, since Oct. 1 on speculative buying. But yesterday's economic data gave investors little incentive to hold precious metals.
Producer prices edged up just two-tenths of 1 percent in September, while retail sales and new unemployment claims rose. The numbers suggested that the United States economy was continuing to grow slowly, with almost no inflation.
Investment demand for precious metals typically rises with inflation. Silver is sensitive to economic growth because it is used mainly as an industrial metal.
 
Further Drop Seen
 "Ninety percent of silver is consumed in the industrial nations of North America, Europe and Japan, and if you look around, none of those is doing especially well," said George Milling-Stanley of Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. "None is showing the kind of robust economic growth you need to support silver."
He predicted silver would drop, possibly to $4 an ounce, a price at which the metal last traded on Sept. 14.
But Ted Ryan, the director of futures research for the Chicago Corporation, a trading company, said he expected silver and gold to rally late in the fourth quarter and into 1994 as demand picked up overseas.
On other commodity markets, live cattle futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on higher cash prices and perceptions that the market had established a seasonal bottom and would move higher.
Live cattle for October delivery rose almost a cent, to 72.07 cents a pound; October feeder cattle rose a quarter of a cent, to 84.50 cents a pound; October live hogs fell more than a half-cent, to 48.97 cents a pound; February frozen pork bellies fell more than a tenth of a cent, to 57.72 cents a pound.
Light sweet crude oil for November delivery fell 14 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $18.50 a barrel; November heating oil fell more than a tenth of a cent, to 55.52 cents a gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose a third of a cent, to 52.92 cents a gallon; November natural gas fell 3.8 cents, to $2.167 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Same Winter Racing, but Three More Days at Saratoga

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
New York's race tracks defused their dispute with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo yesterday when they agreed to continue racing all winter at Aqueduct despite severe losses last winter. But they pleaded for the Governor to soften the financial crunch by deferring the payment of some taxes and by allowing New York to expand simulcast betting on races televised from Florida.
The tracks also voted to add three days to the booming summer season at Saratoga. The five-week season will not be expanded to six full weeks. But three days will be added as a "preview weekend" starting on Friday, July 22, for a total of 33 days at the homey 126-year-old track in the foothills of the Adirondacks. 
 The actions were approved by the trustees of the New York Racing Association at their monthly meeting at Belmont Park almost on the eve of Belmont's busiest and grandest day of autumn racing. It will be staged tomorrow as the Breeders' Cup Preview with seven stakes races with $2.4 million in purses.
The trustees didn't settle the ultimate issue of winter racing, but they did remove it for now as a point of conflict with the Governor, who has been insisting on winter racing for the taxes and jobs it provides. Officials of the New York Racing Association have said they lost $9 million racing in bad weather last winter, and they repeated their arguments yesterday.
 
Relief Is Sought
 "N.Y.R.A.'s desire to continue winter racing," said Gerard J. McKeon, president of the association, "is tempered by an equally strong commitment to avoid the unfortunate and detrimental situation that occurred last winter when N.Y.R.A. had to choose between continuing operations or deferring the payment of taxes. Winter racing runs at a significant loss."
But, he said, "from trainers to hot-walkers, white caps to maintenance employees, thousands of people rely on year-round racing in New York." And he asked the state to supply financial relief, presumably by deferring the regular collections of parimutuel taxes and by inducing the Legislature to expand simulcast betting beyond the 50 races a year now authorized.
Allen Gutterman, vice president for marketing, said the ideal combination might be seven live races a day at Aqueduct plus five televised from Gulfstream Park near Miami, which will run from Jan. 4 to March 16. The Meadowlands track began carrying full racing programs from Gulfstream and other tracks last winter, and business soared.
"We're going to race all winter long," Gutterman said. "The state wants us to race. The trainers want us to race. The horsemen want us to race. Our employees want us to race. This is our mandate. But every year, more trainers are racing in Florida, and more jockeys. Last year, Julie Krone spent the winter there. This year, Mike Smith."
 
Two New Wrinkles
 Under the calendar reported yesterday, Belmont will close next Monday, then Aqueduct will open next Wednesday and run through May 2. Racing will switch to Belmont on May 4 and continue through Wednesday, July 20. Then comes the new wrinkle in Saratoga dates.
Racing, which normally opens at Saratoga on a Wednesday late in July, will open instead on Friday, July 22, for the three-day preview weekend and will continue through Monday, Aug. 29. After a three-day pause, which is also new, it will switch back to Belmont on Friday, Sept. 2.
 
FINISH LINES
 The issues of geography, pace, distance and money were decided in different ways for two star horses, Diazo and Valley Crossing, for the weekend's big races. They were entered in both the $500,000 Meadowlands Cup tonight and the $850,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup tomorrow. But BILL SHOEMAKER, who trains Diazo, said from California that his horse would run at Belmont. And RICHARD SMALL, who trains Valley Crossing, said that he would run in the Meadowlands. ALLEN JERKENS, who trains Devil His Due, the favorite in the Gold Cup, said that the race would be "like a war," especially with the title of Horse of the Year still wide open. Dehere, the favorite for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and even for next year's Kentucky Derby, remained the shortest-priced favorite in the Belmont jamboree at 2-5 in the $500,000 Champagne Stakes. His trainer, REYNALDO NOBLES, said the colt had learned a lesson after losing the Futurity by half a length last month in the mud. "He's more aggressive, mentally and physically," Nobles said. "He's a dream horse." Dehere's main threat may be NICK ZITO 's Crary, who has raced twice and won twice. How does Zito feel? "Very optimistic," he said. "I think he's a special horse."
