HEADLINE: Race Fight at Boston High School Evokes 1974 Uproar Over Busing

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 7

 BODY:
The streets of South Boston were calm today, and school officials prepared to reopen classes next week in phases. But uneasiness lingered in the largely white neighborhood after Thursday's racially motivated fight outside the public high school.
For many people here, Thursday's disturbance recalled the disturbances over busing 19 years ago. But unlike 1974, when whites vented their fury at black students being bused in, today there were more shades of opinion. 
 In a park at the Mary Ellen McCormack housing project, a group of white students from the high school, which had been closed for the day in the wake of the melee, responded to a reporter's questions with racial slurs. Mike Millhous, 15, boasted that he had thrown bottles at black students in Thursday's fight.
But around the corner, two white women, Linda Copell and Marie Masse, sat on the stoop outside their apartment talking about their fears that their neighborhood would be unfairly portrayed as a bastion of racism.
"We're not racists," said Mrs. Masse, an unemployed cafeteria manager who grew up in the projects. "I have friends who are black. My son's best friend is black. Things have not been bad here for years."
Her son, Bryan, a 19-year-old senior, said he was deeply disturbed by Thursday's fight. "This shouldn't be happening," he said. "It's a school. It's there for learning, not fighting."
Mrs. Masse said the fight, which involved 200 students, stirred painful memories of 1974, when she was a senior at South Boston High School. "It was hell," she said. "There were soldiers on every rooftop. It turned blacks and whites against each other."
The high school's student population, which was overwhelmingly white 19 years ago, is now 27 percent white, 37 percent black, 24 percent Hispanic and 12 percent Asian. Most of the nonwhite students are bused in from other neighborhoods.
Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black senior, rides the subway to the high school every day from the predominantly black Roxbury neighborhood just west of the South Boston area. He said that despite the problems, he felt fortunate to attend South Boston High School.
"South Boston is one of the better inner-city schools," Mr. Brown said. "There is a lot of tension right now in the school. There is a feeling of war between blacks and whites. In the boys' bathroom, it says, 'We hate niggers' on the wall." And he added that the bathroom graffiti also says, "We hate honkies."
There were not many black faces on the streets of South Boston today. But neither were there Federal troops, as there were in 1974, when hundreds of white residents took to the streets in protest, shouting racial slurs and sometimes hurling rocks. And although Boston police patrolled the neighborhood today, unlike 19 years ago there were not hundreds of them and they were not dressed in riot gear.
 
Incident vs. Disorder
 As he drove through the neighborhood, Ed Jesser, a political consultant who was born in the Mary Ellen McCormack project, was struck by the quiet. "Twenty years ago there were flotillas of police officers, day after day," he said. "Yesterday was an incident; 20 years ago there was civil disorder."
The school superintendent, Lois Harrison Jones, announced that seniors would return to South Boston High School on Monday, juniors on Tuesday and the rest of the school on Wednesday.
At an emergency meeting at City Hall today, black and white political leaders and school officials talked about ways to prevent a recurrence of Thursday's incident. "What happened at South Boston could have happened anywhere," said Dianne Wilkerson, a black state Senator from Roxbury.
In an interview, James Kelly, the white City Councilor who represents South Boston, blamed blacks for the racial tensions in his district. "They're going into mom-and-pop stores and taking whatever they want," he said. "You get 15 black males who all look like Mike Tyson's brothers, and there's one merchant. Is he going to say something to them? No."
Mr. Kelly attributed fear and tensions in the high school to black students, "a good portion of whom act like a bunch of terrorists."
Mayor Raymond Flynn, who spent today walking the streets of South Boston and the Roxbury neighborhood, described plans to install hand-held metal detectors at the high school. The Mayor, a lifelong resident of South Boston who initially opposed busing but has since become a symbol of racial healing, was meeting with students about school safety on Thursday morning before the fight began.
The mayor and the police said that reports of weapons had been greatly exaggerated. One gun and 20 knives were confiscated from students at the high school this year, the Mayor said.

HEADLINE: Ex-Gov. Hunt Is Sentenced To 1,000 Hours of Service

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., May 7

 BODY:
Guy Hunt, the part-time preacher who became Alabama's first Republican Governor since Reconstruction, was ordered to pay $210,000 and serve 1,000 hours of community service today after his conviction and removal from office last month for illegally converting money from his inauguration for his own use.
Mr. Hunt, a farmer and former Amway salesman whose unlikely rise and catastrophic fall became one of the most unlikely political stories of recent years, avoided going to prison when Judge Randall Thomas of State Circuit Court suspended a five-year prison sentence. Mr. Hunt left the courthouse unrepentant, telling supporters at a rally on the Capitol steps that an appeal would put him back in the Governor's office. 
 "When I return to this office here you elected me to, we'll just all get together and have the biggest old cry you've ever seen," he told about 200 admirers who gathered in the sweltering midday sun for an emotional rally in which his removal from office was compared with the crucifixion of Jesus.
Skeptics said Mr. Hunt's legacy would be another dour chapter in the history of a state still struggling to emerge from the quarter century, ended in 1987, in which George C. Wallace dominated the political landscape.
 
Footnote in History
 "He was totally out of his depth," said Carl Grafton, a political science professor at Auburn University at Montgomery. "He never should have been Governor in the first place. Historically, this will be worth one sentence in the history books 20 years from now."
But Mr. Hunt may not be down yet. His lawyers contend, and many legislators agree, that his conviction reflected a judge's charge to the jury that held him to higher standards than were reflected in state law or common political practice.
Mr. Hunt combined the down-home piety of a country preacher with a street politician's nose for raising money. He had a Reaganite contempt for government programs and a sovereign's love for the trappings of power.
A part-time Primitive Baptist preacher, farmer and former rural county probate judge with a high school education, Mr. Hunt first ran for Governor in 1978 and received 26 percent of the vote.
 
Victorious 'Sacrificial Lamb'
 He continued to stay close to politics, serving as chairman of Ronald Reagan's campaign in Alabama in 1980, a position he had also held in 1976. He was viewed as a Republican sacrificial lamb in 1986 in a state that had not elected a Republican governor since Reconstruction. But he was the beneficiary of a murderous Democratic primary in which the party nominee, the conservative Attorney General Charles Graddick, was ruled off the ballot and replaced by the man Mr. Graddick had defeated in the Democratic primary, a relatively liberal former Attorney General named Bill Baxley. When the smoke cleared, Mr. Hunt, was Governor.
"Somebody pinch me," he said.
Mr. Hunt was popular with white rural voters, and his anti-tax, laissez-faire agenda fit in well with the spirit of the times. He confounded critics and the powerful Democratic Party by winning re-election in 1990.
Republicans say Mr. Hunt's pro-business stance was good for the state's economy, which grew at a faster pace than that of the nation while he was in office.
"He was a pretty good Governor," said Marty Connors, a former executive director of the Alabama Republican Party. "He brought in creative business types who revamped many state agencies, and while we may not have gotten the Nissan-type contracts, for the first time in years we saw ourselves on many companies' short list. One of the disappointments was that we had a chance to set a very proactive agenda, but we didn't."
Others say that is a polite way of saying the Governor had no real legislative achievements for a state grappling with fundamental problems of poverty, bottom-of-the-barrel schools and an outdated tax code. In his second term, he played no significant role in the legislative process, legislators and political analysts say.
 
Earlier Complaint of Abuses
 And the conviction is not the only blow to Mr. Hunt's image of small-town probity.
In 1981, as a reward for his service to Mr. Reagan, Mr. Hunt was given the full-time post of State Executive Director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. After an employee of the agency complained of irregularities in November 1984, a Department of Agriculture report found that he had repeatedly claimed reimbursement for travel to his home when no official reason for the trip was evident.
Six subordinates gave sworn statements that he had his underlings produce on government time political mailing lists, correspondence, budgets and other political work in anticipation of his next race for Governor. Such political activity is a violation of the Federal Hatch Act. Employees also said he had tried to obstruct the inquiry.
Mr. Hunt resigned to run for Governor shortly after the Federal report in April 1985 said the evidence already produced "is more than sufficient to require Hunt's immediate removal from the Federal service."
After being elected Governor, Mr. Hunt showed a selective appetite for the perquisites of power. His regular use of the state plane to go to preaching engagements started the inquiry that led to his indictment. When the State Ethics Commission ruled that he might have violated the law by using the state plane for 18 preaching trips in which he pocketed $10,000 in donations, he said the ethics law did not apply to him.
While most Governors get by with minimal security, Mr. Hunt traveled with a Presidential-style contingent of security personnel, who ended up worming cattle and pruning fruit trees on his farm when he went home. He said the work was voluntary.
His supporters say he did nothing out of keeping with regular political practice. Prosecutors say that by using a nonprofit inaugural fund rather than campaign money, he had illegally used his office for political gain.
"By the judge's standard, 90 percent of the elected officials in Alabama could go to jail," Mr. Connors said.
 
Problems of Alabama
 Still, to many, the tragedy of his administration is that Alabama, which has lagged behind other Southern states in modernizing state government, has six more years to make up for.
"The business community in this state encouraged the people of the state to re-elect an individual that they wouldn't consider hiring for their own company," said Bill Barnard, a history professor at the University of Alabama. "I think many of them came to rue the role that they had played."

HEADLINE: Grocery Workers Begin Strike in New Jersey

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Striking grocery store workers formed picket lines at some northern New Jersey supermarkets yesterday, while management began locking out employees at nearby stores and reopening with temporary workers.
Some 28,000 workers at 312 supermarkets in three states could join the striking workers now that contract negotiations have broken off because of a dispute over health care. 
 A spokesman for ShopRite, Foodtown, Grand Union and Pathmark supermarkets confirmed that union employees at some stores were being replaced by temporary workers.
 
'Sound Economic Policy'
 "We have initiated lockouts at a select number of stores in a contiguous area to those being picketed," said the spokesman, Donald Vaillancourt. "We are simply following a sound economic policy."
Mr. Vaillancourt would not say how many stores were being selected for lockouts.
Frank Margiotta, a spokesman for United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1262 said that 10 Pathmark and Foodtown stores in northern New Jersey were being staffed with replacement workers. He said picketing could spread to other stores over the weekend.
Local 1262 represents workers at New Jersey stores in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren counties. In New York the strike could affect all of the ShopRites in Dutchess, Sullivan and Ulster counties and some of the Grand Unions and ShopRites in Orange and Rockland counties. One Grand Union in Milford in Pike County, Pa., could also be affected. The strike will not affect stores in Connecticut.
 
No Contract Since April 10
 Members of Local 1262 have been without a contract since April 10.
Luella Hardy, an employee at the ShopRite in Jersey City, said she had been chastising those crossing the line.
"I've been saying to my customers, 'Shame on you,' " said Ms. Hardy, 58, of Jersey City. "They say, 'Well, I have to eat.' Some say they have to buy food for their cat, or food for their dog. No way can anyone tell me a good reason for crossing a picket line."

HEADLINE: Reno Questions Drug Policy's Stress on Smuggling

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Attorney General Janet Reno today questioned the wisdom of spending billions of dollars a year to stop the production and transportation of narcotics from abroad and vowed to take steps that would make treatment for drug abusers more widely available.
In her most extensive comments on national drug policy since she took office nearly two months ago, she said more serious consideration had to be given to alternatives to prison sentences for drug offenders. 
 Ms. Reno suggested what she called "a carrot and stick approach," in which drug offenders are offered counseling by case managers instead of prison sentences. Offenders would be threatened with incarceration if they failed to complete treatment programs. She also said that Federal courts had been taking on too many small cases involving drug abusers that would be better handled by the states.
Her comments, before a national drug conference here attended by judges, prosecutors, academics and lawmakers, largely echoed the oratory of the Clinton Presidential campaign, and they stood in sharp contrast to the law-and-order speeches of her predecessors over the last decade. The Reagan and Bush Administrations spent billions of dollars increasing the role of the Federal Government in prosecuting narcotics cases, and considerably less on rehabilitation and prevention.
 
Difference With Clinton
 But Ms. Reno's remarks were somewhat contrary to the drug priorities in the Clinton Administration's budget, which was completed just as Ms. Reno took office in March. By seeking almost $2 on law-enforcement operations for every $1 on treatment programs, the Clinton budget of $13.04 billion for fighting drugs largely continues the Bush Administration's policy.
Among the most criticized elements of the Reagan-Bush drug policies were the expensive and largely unsuccessful efforts to stop overseas farmers from producing the raw material for cocaine and opium and to block the smuggling of the drugs into the United States.
Mr. Clinton cut financing for some international operations in South America and Asia by 8 percent. That would trim $44 million from spending last year of $536 million. But he added $19 million for fighting smuggling, bringing spending in that category to $1.765 billion, much of it going to the Defense Department.
Ms. Reno stopped short of criticizing the Republican drug policy or the White House's budget, but it appeared from her remarks that they did not reflect her own preferences. She put more emphasis on treatment and less on pursuing cocaine and heroin producers in South America and Asia.
 
Questioning Drug Seizures
 "In terms of interdiction, we've got to ask questions," Ms. Reno said, noting that at best, 25 percent of the drugs entering the southeastern United States had been confiscated. Law-enforcement authorities say 75 percent would have to be seized before putting a real dent in drug use, a goal she called "economically prohibitive."
Ms. Reno said the Justice Department had begun to review whether too many minor drug cases were being handled by the Federal Government and courts. She suggested that those cases be prosecuted instead by local authorities, with more sharing of prisons by Federal and state authorities.
She also criticized the long minimum prison sentences that are mandatory for relatively minor drug offenses, saying they had begun to hamper the criminal justice system. She has announced a review of such sentencing procedures, and Justice Department officials say she will probably recommend new legislation this year and changes in the way Federal prosecutors prepare low-level cases.
Ms. Reno said the mandatory minimum prison terms and tough treatment under the Federal sentencing guidelines had been established with "no regard as to whether we have the prison cells to match the sentences."

HEADLINE: Airlines Reluctantly Match Northwest's Fare Cuts

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Most major airlines agreed yesterday to match the summer fare cuts announced by Northwest Airlines late Thursday evening, but what started as a routine announcement of matching fares turned into a mini-seminar on such industry problems as competition, accusations of price-fixing, incipient price wars and the financial health of individual carriers.
The day began as routinely as a takeoff or landing, with most airlines saying they would match the Northwest cuts, which on average slice 20 to 30 percent off regular fares but are loaded with restrictions. 
 However, American Airlines, the industry leader, waited until late afternoon to say it would match, and even then added that it could not talk about its purchase dates until it advertised them nationally.
 
Influence of Antitrust Suit
 That is in keeping with American's earlier decision not to respond to such questions from reporters for fear of running afoul of Justice Department recommendations that were made as part of a civil antitrust suit. The suit accused eight airlines of fixing prices and restraining price competition.
Most of the carriers are fighting the accusations, but several including American have agreed to abide by the recommendations, hoping that will protect them from private triple-damage lawsuits by consumers.
The travel industry, consumer groups and many members of Congress have criticized the Justice Department recommendations, contending the guidelines themselves are likely to restrain price competition.
Northwest, which had introduced another fare sale two weeks ago, said it had decided on the new one to bring in "incremental revenue" at a time when the economy remained soft.
Phillip Brannon, a high-yield bond analyst at the Mabon Securities Corporation in New York, said that Northwest's strategy suggested that the privately held, financially troubled airline was desperate for money -- a suggestion that Northwest denied.
Mr. Brannon cited several reasons for his assessment. Among them is the statement that Northwest filed with the Transportation Department on Dec. 31 listing assets of $1.3 billion and liabilities of $2.1 billion. "Combined with that you have the balance sheet for the fourth quarter, where they lost $160 million on an operating basis, and for all 12 months of 1992 they lost $309 million," he said.
Mr. Brannon also said that Northwest officials knew that their strategy of cutting fares at a time when the industry was losing money, and especially cutting them during the busy summer months, put Northwest at risk of retaliation from American.
The two carriers set off last summer's money-losing fare war when Northwest adopted a two-for-one sale and American countered with a systemwide half-price sale.
"Northwest is the carrier that can least afford a sustained fare war," Mr. Brannon said, "yet they are the ones that most often announce sales that are likely to start them. I can only conclude from that that they are desperate."
Mark Abels, a Northwest spokesman, said in response, "The logic that having a promotion or sale is a sign of unusual distress is not very compelling."
Standard & Poor's said this week that NWA Inc. and its Northwest unit remained on credit watch with negative implications. "If Northwest is able to reach satisfactory labor agreements," the agency told Aviation Daily, "parent NWA would greatly increase its chances of restructuring its bank and other private credit facilities to extend debt maturities. Without such a financial restructuring, NWA would find it very difficult to meet large repayments due in 1994."
After losing billions of dollars in recent years, the airlines have been trying desperately to raise fares, but they have been thwarted by a sluggish economy and overcapacity. In a speech on April 30, Robert L. Crandall, American's chief executive, said that in the last decade average industry revenue per seat mile had dropped 25 percent after inflation.
Mr. Abels said Northwest's sales were carefully specified, tickets could be bought only during an 11-day period, and seats were limited on each flight. "Our thought is to do a targeted and limited promotion that will yield profits," he said, "and we have every reason to believe that's what we're doing."
 
Variety of Restrictions
 Under the fare sale, which ends at midnight May 18, travel must begin on or after May 27 and be completed by Sept. 15. Tickets must be bought at least 14 days before departure, and fares on some routes are cheaper if travel is completed by June 30. Seats are subject to availability and a Saturday stay is required.
With the new fares, flights between New York and Los Angeles will be $378 round trip, compared with a regular 14-day advance fare with Saturday stay-over of $530; a New York-Washington round trip will drop to $118 from $160, and New York-Chicago will be $198, down from $290.

HEADLINE: Canada Wins Victory on Its Lumber Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 7

 BODY:
A binational trade panel has handed Canada a major victory in a long-running dispute with the United States over trade in softwood lumber.
The five-member Free Trade Agreement panel late Thursday essentially found that the Commerce Department had not made its case that Canada subsidized exports. On the basis of those subsidies, the United States imposes $200 million a year in duties on Canadian softwood, used mainly in home building. 
 The panel said that the Commerce Department had not considered all the evidence or followed its own regulations in setting the duties. It instructed it to re-examine its findings on each of the key issues in the case and respond within 90 days.
The duties stay in effect during the reconsideration process.
In terms of trade volume, the softwood dispute is by far the most significant between the two countries under terms of the free trade pact. Canada last year shipped $4.4 billion in softwood to the United States. Despite the 6.5 percent tariff, shipments were up 14.6 percent form 1991.
Canada's Trade Minister, Michael Wilson, hailed the decison as "very positive." Exports to the United States account for more than half of total Canadian lumber production. The industry is one of the major employers in Canada, where joblessness is 11 percent, half again as high as in the United States.
In the last 40 years, the United States has used more lumber than it has produced and Canada has made up the difference. But in the last decade the American industry has been up in arms over what is now Canada's 29 percent penetration of the American market and has accused Canadians of unfair trade practices.
A major complaint has been that the fees that Canadian provinces charge companies to harvest timber are less than what American lumber companies have to pay to cut timber on public and private land in the United States. The disparity, American producers say, gives Canadian exporters an unfair advantage, which entitles the United States industry to the protection of duties.
The panel, addressing that point in its ruling, said the department should have considered whether provincial timber fees distorted normal competitive markets before concluding that they were a subsidy against which duties might be imposed.
The Commerce Department had set the 6.5 percent countervailing duty a year ago. Many analysts here think the department will have to either eliminate or reduce it to meet the panel's standards.
Adam Darling, a spokesman for the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration, said the department was "obviously disappointed." He declined further comment, noting that the department still had to digest the panel's "very dense" 170-page report.
A Washington-based body representing the domestic American industry, the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports, said the panel had "exceeded its authority" and "substituted its judgment for that of the responsibile U.S. agency."
The Canadian lumber industry was ecstatic. "It's hard to imagine how we could have had a stronger decision from a binational panel," said Tom Buell, chairman of the Vancouver-based Canadian Forest Industries Council. "The binational panel today flunked the Commerce Department in Economics 101."
 
Panels Set Up Under Pact
 Under the four-and-a-half-year-old Free Trade Agreement, binational panels are set up to determine whether laws of either country are correctly and fairly applied in trade decisions. Canada had insisted on this to allay its fear of arbitrary rulings by American Government agencies responding to protectionist pressures.
Panels have been convened on dozens of trade fights with Canada in the last four years, with many decisions favoring Canada. Last month, a Canadian position was upheld in a conflict over exports of live swine that resulted in a refund to Canada of nearly $10 million in duties.
The lumber panel comprised five trade experts: three Canadians and two Americans. Two each were initially chosen from each country and together they agreed on the fifth.
Lumber prices rose dramatically last year, reflecting the shortage in the United States combined with an increase in home building and environmental restrictions on logging. Lately, prices have softened.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Skittishness About Bosnia Helps to Push Dollar Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher against major foreign currencies yesterday as traders, nervous about possible military intervention in Bosnia, bought the American currency ahead of the weekend.
The broad advance came despite April employment figures that were slightly worse than expected. While the dollar initially moved lower on these numbers, it rebounded after not droppping below a key psychological level against the German mark. 
 Gold slipped late yesterday after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 70 cents an ounce, to $356.70. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $356.30 an ounce, off 70 cents.
Currency traders said they were first disappointed by the Labor Department's report that nonfarm jobs rose by 119,000 in April; a 150,000 gain had been expected by economists.
But when the dollar did not fall below 1.5800 German marks, many traders decided that the currency had reached a bottom and began to cover their short sales by buying it back. (In a short sale, traders sell borrowed investments in the hope that they can profit by buying them back at a lower price.)
In New York, the dollar ended the day at 1.58375 German marks, up from 1.57405 on Thursday.
 
No Clear Relationship Seen
 Analysts said the increased tension in Bosnia in itself had not convinced traders to buy dollars, which are often viewed as a safe haven during international conflicts. But many participants were hesitant to go into the weekend short of dollars.
"There doesn't seem to be a Bosnia, good-dollar, bad-dollar relationship," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
Also helping to prop up the dollar against the Japanese yen were unconfirmed reports that the Bank of Japan intervened in Tokyo trading with purchases of about $500 million.
The dollar fell as low as 109.65 yen in Tokyo before closing at 110.10, down 0.09 yen from Thursday's close. Later, in New York, it ended the day at 110.30 yen, up from 110.03 yen on Thursday.
"The market sees 110 yen as where the market expects the central banks to start showing up," said Ronald Leven, global currency analyst at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5730, from $1.5699 Thursday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.5720 late yesterday afternoon, down from $1.5805 Thursday.

HEADLINE: Arms Makers Vie to Build Rail Cars

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 7

 BODY:
In what public officials here are billing as the first serious effort to steer the declining weapons industry toward commercial work, five of the nation's largest military and aerospace contractors are competing for a contract to build rail cars for this city's new mass transit system.
The military contractors have each joined forces with established rail-car manufacturers to bid for the contract, which is seen as a test case of whether the companies can successfully transfer decades of high-tech weapons production into marketable products for the rapidly expanding transportation equipment and services market.
The contract, with an estimated value of $200 million, is to be awarded by the end of June. It covers the building of 87 cars for the city's Green Line, scheduled to open in late 1994, and to develop technologically advanced transportation products that can be used in Los Angeles cars and other transit systems worldwide.
"Unlike some businesses that the defense contractors are considering entering, transportation is still an underdeveloped market, and a lot of the skills used in defense are applicable to mass transit," said James Raffel, a research analyst for the National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament, a Washington group.
Rail-car industry executives appear pleased to form partnerships with military contractors, which they said had developed a variety of technologies that would benefit future mass transit systems.
They may include lightweight frames for rail cars and buses, made from the same composite materials that the military contractors use in their rocket and missile designs. The contractors may also use their knowledge of aerospace electronics to develop safer braking and more fuel-efficient propulsion systems for the rail cars.
"Most of this technology has been too expensive for us to develop for the current market, and a lot of it has been kept confidential or classified as sensitive because of its use by the military," said Thomas J. Smith, president of the Morrison Knudsen Corporation's rail system group, which has teamed with the Hughes Aircraft Company and the Lockheed Corporation. "It's a unique opportunity for us to get our hands on some of it."
Many weapons industry experts and executives have long maintained that the skills the contractors gained in building complex weaponry like missiles, jet fighters and radar have direct applications to transportation. Even critics say that if military contractors are at all successful in commercial ventures, they will most likely be transportation related, mainly because that market remains largely undeveloped.
 Yet Mr. Raffel said that military contractors were unlikely to enter the market for transportation equipment and services, despite its predicted fast growth, unless the Federal Government made a considerable investment in the development of new technologies and in the rebuilding of roads, bridges and mass transit.
As an example of why such conversion efforts are prone to fail when there is no Government support, Mr. Raffel cites the Boeing Corporation's early success in building rail cars and trolleys after the Vietnam War. But the Seattle-based jet builder ultimately abandoned its rail-car efforts when financing from the Urban Mass Transit Administration was cut during the Carter and Reagan Administrations and the market became unstable.
President Clinton has said he intends to increase Federal investment in transportation and rebuilding roads and the like, but no specific plans have yet been formulated.
The American Public Transit Association, an industry group, estimates that transit systems across the United States will have to spend about $8.1 billion by the end of the decade to replace rail vehicles and keep them in proper working order. That amount compares with $4.5 billion spent in 1990.
Los Angeles plans to spend $150 billion over the next 30 years on a 400-mile metro system that includes light- , heavy- and commuter-rail systems. About $70 billion will be spent on the light-rail system, which will require hundreds of rail cars.
 
 
Motive Was Loss of Jobs
 Officials of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that the region's loss of some 150,000 aerospace and weapons jobs in the last five years prompted them to structure the rail-car procurement as an enticement for military contractors to consider transportation work to offset the decline in military business.
"We've worked very hard to encourage local aerospace and defense firms to form these partnerships with the rail-car industry to help them make the transition into the emerging surface transportation industry," said Mike Antonovich, chairman of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The four bidding teams are: the Northrop Corporation with the Bombardier Corporation; Lockheed, Hughes and Morrison Knudsen; TRW Aerospace, the AAI Corporation and the Siemens Duewag Corporation, and the Rockwell International Corporation with the Sumitomo Corporation.
Under the contract, the winning team will receive up to $10 million to develop product ideas, which will be tested on two prototype cars and possibly be included in some of the 87 cars ordered. The winning team is expected to be well positioned to compete for other transit rail contracts and to sell its products across the country and overseas.
But some critics and supporters of conversion alike say that the military contractors have yet to show a real commitment to transportation and that the companies' participation in the Los Angeles rail system is only window dressing because it requires little capital investment.
 
Union Is Skeptical
 "If they are serious about transportation, why aren't they creating design and development centers within the companies to study the new technologies and make prototypes?" asked Don Nakamoto, research director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 727 in Los Angeles. "They are very reluctant to take the first step."
Mr. Nakamoto, whose union strongly supports conversion for jobs growth, said he believed the city's effort to get military contractors to participate in the rail-car procurement was partly political. After the metropolitan transportation commission canceled a $121.8 million contract it had awarded to Sumitomo for the Green Line cars, amid a storm of criticism about the selection of a foreign-owned company, it was forced to find American companies to bid with foreign rail-car makers, Mr. Nakamoto said.
Gwendolyn Williams, manager of contracting for the vehicle acquisition project for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that initially the rail-car makers responded coldly to the idea of teaming with the military contractors because the two were in totally different businesses. After months of collaboration, however, the rail-car makers have expressed optimism that the partnerships will prosper.
Greg Fountain, Lockheed's manager of advanced product development for commercial systems, said that the Los Angeles procurement represented an opportunity to test ideas. "The critical issue here is that we in the defense business must learn to assess the needs of the market and match those needs with the appropriate technology," he said. "In the past we were just given requirements and we met them."
Mr. Fountain said that if Lockheed was successful in developing new transportation technologies, he believed the new area of business could amount to as much as $100 million in annual revenue and possibly more in the long term.
 
Rockwell Sees Advantage
 Officials of Rockwell International said they believed they had an advantage over other military contractors competing for the Los Angeles rail contract because of the company's history of translating military technology into transportation products.
Using its military navigation and electronics skills, Rockwell recently developed satellite navigation and communications systems that are being used by trucking companies, transit systems and railroads to track vehicles and provide the latest type of communications. The contractor is also developing so-called intelligent vehicle highway systems, a traffic management tool, and it is a major supplier of car and truck components and systems.
"It's not hard to imagine transportation being half of Rockwell International," Mr. Black said. "The same technology that we put in infrared sensors can be used for traffic-lane monitoring or even for collision avoidance in cars. The trick is correctly identifying the market and applying the technology."

Women See a Future And the Collars Are Blue

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman

 BODY:
WHILE one group of women learned about double-headed nails in carpentry, another group built up upper-body strength on weight machines in a renovated firehouse on West 20th Street, where Nontraditional Employment for Women prepares future plumbers, electricians and construction workers.
It was a week after Take Our Daughters to Work Day and the women, many of them single mothers, talked about the day. "I wish we had that when I was young," said one participant in the 13-week program. But it turned out that none had brought daughters to the classes. "It's good for the girls coming up," said a woman from the Bronx, "but we're more interested in the here and now." 
 The 18 students in the current cycle ranged in age from early 20's to 30's. Some had dropped out of high school, others had graduated from two-year colleges. Many were on public assistance and almost all had spotty employment records, mostly short stints of this and that, working in stores, baby-sitting, clerical jobs, that fizzled out far short of a meaningful future. All said they heard of Nontraditional Employment for Women, or NEW, on the street.
"I saw this woman driving a crane and when I asked her how she got the job, she told me about the program," said Bernadette Blocker, a 30-year-old who, like the other women in her class, puts in eight-hour days learning practical skills, lifting weights and taking courses on the history of women in the workplace. "I just wish I'd known about it years ago," said Ms. Blocker, who hopes to apprentice as a union electrician.
In fact, NEW started 14 years ago. As explained by Gardenia White, its executive director, up to 300 women a year are being helped to find blue-collar jobs that pay at least $8 an hour. "It's an extremely focused program," she said. "The women come to us, we provide the training and we help them get the jobs." Close ties have been established with employers like Con Edison, New York Telephone and unions in the building trades.
All the trainees are poor and unemployed, 78 percent are single heads of households, 66 percent are high-school dropouts and 98 percent are black or Hispanic. Of the 2,500 women hard hats working in New York City, more than half were trained at NEW. This is still a tiny percentage of all such workers, but each year the number has been rising and currently as many as half the apprenticeships in some important unions are going to women.
For students like Ms. Blocker, such statistics are comforting. They encourage hopes that after many zigzags, flights of fancy and dead ends, real change is about to take place in their lives. At lunch they recite pay scales of various jobs like mantras that will assure them success in a short time, if not quite here and now. They look for confirmation in the records of earlier graduates.
There is, for example, Frieda Maldonado, a 49-year-old single mother of four, who talked about her life on a break from her job as the operator of a front-end loader at a paving job on Avenue of the Americas at 53d Street. Minutes earlier she had expertly backed the machine into traffic and nudged a two-ton metal plate over an excavation. "I love it, it's so exciting," said the woman, who earns $27.30 an hour as a journeyman operator in Local 15 of the International Union of Operating Engineers.
"Before I went to the NEW program I was on public assistance," she said. "I still remember when I went there and decided I'd go into construction, my kids said I was crazy. Now they think I'm great and my youngest daughter is going to take the test for the union. Maybe we'll make it a mother-daughter union."
Another role model is Angela Jeter, 31, who came back for a visit from her job as a general utility worker for Con Edison in Westchester. "I'm making good money and I'm on a track where I can make more," said the woman, who completed her course last October. "I work with transformers and I'm learning all the time. I started at $10.20 an hour, but that's going up as I learn new skills, first to $14.99 and then $16.38 and then to $21.89." She has plans to move out of the Bronx with her 8-year-old son and to buy a car. "Everything is possible now."
"But the best thing is how I'm feeling," she said. "I'm in control of my life. I've got confidence. I'm independent."
She said when she started at Con Edison two other women from NEW started with her. All the other workers were men. "For the first two months the men were real quiet. We expected that and just worked hard. Now it's like we have all these brothers."
She said her son, who backed her from the start, is very happy. "He's seen how I've changed and he thinks it's great that I come home from work as dirty as he comes home from the park."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Changes for Consumers in Treasury's Shift

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

 BODY:
The Government's decision this week to try to save money by borrowing for shorter periods is likely to affect consumers in important, though only slowly unfolding, ways.
The dominant Wall Street view is that by halting sales of new seven-year notes and shrinking sales of 30-year bonds -- replacing this financing with nearer maturities -- the Treasury will inevitably put upward pressure on short-term interest rates. 
 If so, one effect will be to lessen the present strong incentive for consumers to shift money from low-yielding certificates of deposit to bonds and stocks. C.D.'s, in other words, will be relatively more appealing and most of the riskier alternatives less so.
Another impact of the Administration's move will be on borrowers who have adjustable loans tied to short-term rates.
People will be more inclined "to take the plunge and lock into longer-term" fixed-rate loans, suggested David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. This would avoid the pain of a jump in, say,
monthly mortgage payments.
At the same time, investors who have grown fond of intermediate-maturity Treasury paper will still have a sizable choice of merchandise. While no new seven-year notes are to be issued, existing ones will continue to trade as will longer-term bonds that become seven-year securities through the aging process.
There may even be some pluses for consumers in the new financing strategy, though skeptics abound. To the extent the Government places fewer financing demands on the long-term, or 30-year, market this could allow corporate borrowers to tap this area more freely and thereby add to investor choice.
Some, of course, dispute the assumption that the shift in strategy will raise short-term rates -- or do anything really noticeable.
"The Government is a drop in the bucket in the long-term credit market," said David Ranson, president of H. C. Wainwright Economics in Boston.
But all Americans may lament the downgrading of the 30-year bond for one, albeit intangible, reason. Even though it has been auctioned regularly only since the late 1970's, its existence means that at least one country in the world enjoys a political and economic system of such stature that lenders willingly part with their money for a generation, confident their purchasing power will be preserved.
The standard in other nations is 10-year bonds, Mr. Jones noted, contending that the Administration has tarnished a national "badge of honor."

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
The Europe Group Turns Around, Finally

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The sorry course of the 28 mutual funds that invest in European issues has reversed this year, rising 8.3 percent through April 22 compared with a gain of only three-quarters of a percent for domestic stock funds. The Europe funds' stellar performance owes much to the German central bank for easing interest rates.
For Europe fund investors, it's about time. Except for gold, the Europe group has been the worst performer over the last five years. In the last three years, Europe produced a negative average annual return. 
 Many analysts say Europe's economy is two or three years behind the United States; thus, the thinking goes, Europe should be poised for a bull market similar to that in the United States in 1991. For contrarians, Europe seems a perfect bet.
But there are risks ahead. Much of Europe lingers in recession, one aggravated by the unexpectedly huge costs of German unification and the still very high interest rates this has brought, said Stephen A. Schoepke, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J.

HEADLINE: Profits Flow as Savings Banks Convert

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
It may not truly be a free lunch, but depositors who exercise their right to buy stock in savings institutions as they convert from mutual to stock ownership may think they have found the next best thing.
Mutual savings banks and savings and loans are owned by their depositors, but there has been little opportunity for the owners to share in the increased value of those banks as low interest rates have raised profits to record levels. But in the process of converting to stock companies, in which shares are offered at attractive prices to depositors and management, the former "owners" can earn a big profit while the savings institutions benefit by adding to capital. 
 Almost always the stock is offered at such a low price that the shares quickly increase. Among the savings institutions converting in the 15 months ended March 31, share prices rose an average of 30 percent in the first week of trading, according to SNL Securities of Charlottesville, Va.
The lure of big profits has attracted investors ranging from individuals with a savings account to large investment partnerships that have opened accounts in dozens of mutuals so that they will be eligible to buy stock if there is a conversion. In most cases, all depositors with accounts at a cutoff date may buy the same number of shares.
While there is no guarantee that stock prices of savings institutions will continue rising as they have recently -- most analysts agree that profits are at a peak and the era of biggest gains is over -- there is still opportunity for depositors to benefit from the quick rise in stock prices that has been the recent pattern.
"The offering price has to be a little on the low side, just to provide an incentive for people to move their money to a new company," said Michael A. Murphy, a managing director at the Trident Financial Corporation of Raleigh, N.C.
Mr. Murphy noted that shares of many savings institutions were trading for about 90 percent of book value, the net worth of each share after liabilities have been subtracted from assets. New shares, he said, are usually offered at 60 percent to 70 percent of book value. A few years ago, when the outlook for the institutions was bleak, new shares were offered at less than 40 percent of book value.
But despite higher offering prices, and the risk that savings stocks could decline, shares of recently converted savings institutions have done well. This week, for example, shares in Fidelity New York Federal Savings Bank began trading Monday at $13 a share, up from the offering price of $10.80, and by the end of the week had risen to $13.875. Stock in Sunrise Bancorp, the holding company for Sunrise Federal Savings Bank, Farmingdale, L.I., converted April 5 at $10 a share and has since jumped to $13.25.
Investors and securities dealers say they expect the success of recent deals to encourage more managers of the remaining mutual savings institutions to convert. High interest rates and falling real estate prices depleted the industry's ranks during the 1980's, but at the end of last year there were still over 1,200 mutuals, most in good financial health.
"Wall Street has been all over my case, pushing for a conversion," said George L. Engelke Jr., chief executive at the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association in Queens.
Astoria Federal and the Green Point Savings Bank, also based in Queens, are two of the largest remaining mutuals in the country and are often mentioned as candidates for conversion. Among local banks that have announced such plans, Roosevelt Savings Bank, Garden City, L.I., has said depositors as of July 21, 1992, will be eligible to buy stock, but has not yet announced the price. The Columbia Federal Savings Bank of Queens also plans to convert.
Although many of the largest savings institutions that issued stock in the mid-1980's have fared poorly -- Goldome of Buffalo and Crossland Savings of Brooklyn, for example, have failed -- those memories have faded as low interest rates have improved profits at the survivors. To decide whether to buy stock in conversions, experienced investors offer several tips.
Glen Greenberg, head of Chieftain Capital Management, said investors should look for institutions in which management was buying a significant amount of stock. In recent deals, management has often bought at least 10 percent of the stock, with an additional 7 percent going to an employee stock investment plan.
Institutional investors also look for a conservative business plan where management will adhere to the business they know and not try to grow rapidly by making risky loans.
Many investors favor companies that say they will consider a stock buyback plan. Such repurchases help hold up the stock price and are a good sign that management is not looking to plunge into risky loans.
Mr. Greenberg said that after a savings bank increased its capital by selling stock, "the primary goal of its managers should be to preserve that capital so that they can eventually sell the company at a higher price" to a larger bank.
Harry Keefe, president of Keefe Bank Stock Advisors, an investment firm, said the stock price set in conversions was low enough that "the odds are pretty good" for depositors to make a quick profit on shares they buy. But he adds that there is enough risk that depositors should limit their purchases to amounts within their financial reach, without borrowing.
If you decide to speculate on conversions and try to open many new deposit accounts, be prepared for some blunt refusals. Many banks now reject deposits from outside their area to preserve any future stock offering for local customers. Others are wary of individuals who open many accounts at different banks because that is a common tactic in financial fraud.

HEADLINE: A Festival Of Theater Reaches 30 In Berlin

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 7

 BODY:
Imagine a theater festival in New York in which an impartial jury picks the best productions of the last year in the English-speaking world and brings them together over a three-week period. Along with them come all manner of readings of new plays and public discussions, and every other theater in the city -- assuming that New York boasted several major repertory companies -- stages special performances just to remain competitive.
The Germans have no need to imagine such a thing, because they already have it. The Theatertreffen, or Theater Meeting, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary, brings 12 productions to Berlin in the month of May from Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Spilling into several Berlin theaters, the event attracts eager audiences, roughly half of them theater professionals of one sort or another and a third from outside Berlin. 
 Unlike the midwinter Berlin Film Festival or the early-fall Berlin Festival devoted primarily to music and dance -- all these events are presented by the same umbrella organization, Berlin Festivals -- the Theater Meeting is little known outside the German-speaking world. Theater remains the most language-bound of the performing arts, and so even a festival showcasing the best finds little resonance in the rest of Europe, let alone in the United States.
While the Theater Meeting is a remarkable event, allowing audiences to experience top-notch German theater without searching for it from city to city, this year's festival was almost the last.
"Over the decades, it has been to our advantage that Berlin supported us along with Bonn," said Torsten Mass, deputy director of the Berlin Festivals and for the last five years co-director of the Theater Meeting. Mr. Mass was sitting outside a cafe behind one of the festival's theaters, the Freie Volksbuhne, while inside Botho Strauss, Germany's best-known playwright, was receiving a prize.
"From year to year, Bonn always raised our budget and Berlin matched it," Mr. Mass went on. "But now Germany has economic problems, and as usual politicians want first to snip at culture. Bonn reduced all theater support by 8 percent. We could live with that. But then Berlin said it had to cut, too, because Bonn had, and that would have been a real problem.
"Fortunately, artists always complain. The Theater Meeting is a huge prestige item for them; they scheme to be part of it every year. It wasn't intended to be this kind of Olympiad of the theater, but that's what it is for the artists themselves."
The upshot, Mr. Mass said, was that Berlin did not reduce its support, and Bonn, after threatening to end its subsidy next year, has now guaranteed continued assistance at this year's level.
The entire state and city subsidy comes to only about $1.5 million; Mr. Mass called it "the most cost-efficient festival in the world." The money is spent on theater rentals in Berlin and transportation for the non-Berlin productions and for sending the nine jury members, all journalistic critics, foraging about central Europe in search of excellence.
 
Selecting the Winners
 Each member sees some 200 performances a year out of about 6,000 in the German-speaking world. This year, 250 productions were considered and 82 were chosen as semifinalists and seen by a majority of the jury before the final 12 were selected. (After the reunification of Germany, the number of productions was raised to 12 from 10 and the jury was expanded to 9 from 7.)
The costs of paying the actors and touring backstage personnel are borne by the theaters lucky enough to be selected to participate. They are willing to pay partly because being chosen is enormously prestigious, but also because government-supported German repertory theaters have their personnel on annual contracts and must pay them wherever they perform.
This year, 5 of the 12 productions were staged originally by theaters from Berlin. Naturally, that reduces travel costs, but Mr. Mass insisted that the high number of Berlin productions had nothing to do with cost-cutting.
"In 1991 we had six Berlin productions," he said. "Ever since the fall of the wall, Berlin has become an unparalleled magnet for directors, designers and actors. All the artists want to come here. And whenever you have a theater with a new artistic director, you get a burst of good productions. Which is what happened in 1991 and 1993."
 
An Exercise in Excess
 The big burst of energy this year came from the Volksbuhne on the Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz in the eastern part of the city, where the director Frank Castorf took over this season as artistic director. Mr. Castorf's staging of "King Lear," an archetypally Germanic exercise in screaming, bloody excess that was really more about Mr. Castorf's ideas about Germany (he's agin it) than about Shakespeare, set the tone. (It was also full of a humor so leaden as to make the word "Teutonic" sound fluffy.)
Another Volksbuhne offering, by the Swiss director, author and composer Christoph Marthaler, had the untranslatable title of "Murx den Europaer! Murx ihn! Murx ihn! Murx ihn! Murx ihn ab!" Murx seemed to be a play on Marx, and the two hours consisted of a numbing if occasionally droll study of German, especially East German, fatuities.
The whole thing was like a rather more verbal and musical (and somnolent) version of Pina Bausch's rambling evenings of theatrical choreography, as was Mr. Castorf's "Lear," which was like one of Miss Bausch's variants on a classic (as in her take on Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle"). Somewhat inconsistently, given the frequency with which directors cross over from theater to opera, the Theater Meeting avoids opera. It also avoids dance, except for Miss Bausch. She is not personally represented this year, but a coming piece of "choreographic theater" by Johann Kresnik sounds Bauschian indeed.
 
The New Generation
 Berlin is also represented by productions from the Berliner Ensemble, the Schaubuhne and the Deutsches Theater, all of which have new directors. But the real scope of this festival can be seen in its attention to other cities and especially to the German provinces. This year there are offerings from Bochum, Bonn, Leipzig, Bremen and Heidelberg.
The star of the 1993 Theater Meeting, and emblematic of the direction Mr. Mass feels the festival is taking, is the young director Leander Haussmann. Last Saturday Mr. Haussmann's Munich production of "Romeo and Juliet" opened the festival, which continues until May 20. The festival also includes, within its mere 12 items, another Haussmann Shakespeare staging, this time "A Midsummer Night's Dream" from Weimar. And the Schiller Theater in Berlin just happened to open yet another Haussmann production of a classic, Schiller's "Don Carlos," right before the Theater Meeting began.
Mr. Haussmann, to judge from "Romeo and Juliet," plays almost as loose with Shakespeare's text as Mr. Castorf does. But the mood is defiantly different: fanciful, playful, sexy and even charming. Mr. Haussmann stretches for effects and has too many ideas for the good of any one play or production. But he is most definitely a talent.
Mr. Mass boasted that a new generation of directors, those who succeeded the stern modernists of the post-1968 generation, has now been certified by the festival jury, ever au courant. But many of the productions on view still seem pretty grim and earnest and, yes, Germanic.
Of course, any jury is suspect, and this one's choices may not truly reflect the full range of theater in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. One senses a lingering prejudice, despite Mr. Haussmann's success, against post-modernist playfulness and unabashed scenic beauty, and some of the older directors may be slighted simply because their work is now familiar.
Mr. Mass is used to such complaints. "Every year there is a controversy," he said happily. "Everybody who is not chosen considers it a scandal."

HEADLINE: Hold It While I Focus

 BODY:
Twice recently Bill Clinton has said that the White House needs more "focus." Focus is today's Beltway buzzword to explain the Administration's shapeless start. It's not wholly clear what Mr. Clinton intends to do, but two obvious adjustments are in order.
His first task is to reaffirm the priorities he arrived with. The man who likened himself to a laser beam has grown diffuse. Unless he fixes his attention on the key items -- the economy, health care, ethics legislation -- Congress and public will begin to wander. So far, his vaulting legislative ambitions have produced an agenda so loaded with worthy ideas that it's in danger of stopping dead. 
 The second thing that needs to be snapped into focus is the White House staff. Mr. Clinton conceded as much when he promised to give his amiable chief of staff, Thomas McLarty, another deputy. Jimmy Carter showed what happens at a White House without a dominating chief of staff. George Bush demonstrated the hazards of sticking with the wrong chief.
Only Mr. Clinton knows whether he wants Mr. McLarty eased aside or whether he just wants to help him, but the matter cannot be allowed to drift. One lesson so far is that campaign zeal and eager talk about "re-inventing" government do not convert automatically to orderly government. Sooner or later, the President has to learn that amateurism is his enemy. He was right to proceed quickly with his stimulus package. But his aides set him up for a knockout punch from the opposition by dismissing the Republicans as "irrelevant" -- an act of hubris that did not go unpunished.
Further miscalculations could be fatal to programs that Mr. Clinton really cares about, like health care reform. Anything carrying a $150 billion price tag will require salesmanship. But Mr. Clinton's architects, chiefly Ira Magaziner, show no inclination to open their secret deliberations to inspection. With every day that passes, they miss another chance to build public and Congressional support for whatever is being cooked up behind closed doors.
Besides opening up, Mr. Clinton might also ease up. Just when he was touting the virtues of discipline, his policy-making machine coughed up yet another big item -- an $8 billion plan to revitalize the cities -- and dumped it on an agenda that Congress has already found indigestible.
No wonder the focus is blurred. Asked for their sharpest memory of Mr. Clinton's February address to Congress, most people recall his pledge to tame the deficit by cutting spending and then raising taxes. Since then, however, the public has been pelted with headlines about this spending initiative or that; these reports, combined with Ross Perot's drumfire, have set people to wondering whether Mr. Clinton has forgotten about the deficit.
Mr. Clinton seems to have grasped the point. "What I think we need to do, frankly, is to get the focus back on the things that I have been working on from the beginning. Passing the major programs . . . making sure that Congress will adopt the spending cuts . . . reaffirming that I have no interest in raising taxes until spending is cut. . . ."
Mr. Clinton also said, "After all, I just got here." He's said that before, too, just the way he keeps saying he needs focus. But as Jimmy Carter learned when he spoke of malaise, the public soon grows impatient with people who talk about their problems without really seizing them.

HEADLINE: Gowanus Expressway Should Be Demolished, Not Rebuilt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I have been following with interest and dismay the public discussion on Brooklyn's Gowanus Expressway reconstruction. Once again we have negotiations focusing on the terms without first analyzing the premise: that the Gowanus should be rebuilt. The rationale is that the expressway is deteriorated and is in danger of collapse. This is cause to demolish it! 
 The idea of spending $500 million on 3.8 miles of roadway that not only makes no significant transportation improvement but also does not meet Federal design standards is appalling. Ten years of traffic chaos beginning in Staten Island and Long Island through Brooklyn and into Manhattan, on streets that were not built for this traffic, is equally appalling. And if the past is any judge, both cost and time estimates are just starting points. At least Westway, for all its faults, would have added some value.
The elevated structure should be demolished and an at-grade roadway built, similar to West Street in Manhattan. This could be done in two years at less than 20 percent of the project's estimated cost. Brooklyn's Third Avenue, over which the elevated structure sits, could easily handle six lanes of traffic, with Second and Fourth Avenues supporting the excess traffic.
These funds could be used instead for important projects with significant economic impact: structural improvements are needed for the transportation hubs in downtown Brooklyn, including the Atlantic Avenue Terminal of the Long Island Rail Road. There are high-speed ferries, which have already been proved, and trolleys, which should be re-examined. Let's not repeat past mistakes but move ahead with sound transportation planning.

HEADLINE: VAT's Invisibility Is a Dubious Virtue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Value-Added Tax," your April 26 Business Day news analysis, contains the astounding assertion that economists are attracted to the tax because "it is largely invisible; consumers pay it, but often do not see it, because it is usually incorporated quietly into the final retail price." 
 I believe that mainstream economics has a very different view on the desirability of "hidden taxes": The government should not undertake any spending unless the benefits to the citizenry exceed the costs. Therefore, unless citizens know their tax burdens, they cannot form sensible opinions about how much spending is desirable, and communicate these opinions to their elected representatives.
A good system of public finance requires that people know their tax burdens, not that these burdens be hidden.

What's So Funny About Bananas?

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
The word banana makes people smile; why?
Maybe it's the spelling. Hubert Horatio Humphrey, who knew he had a tendency to speechify at great length, liked to say, "I'm like the little boy who knew how to spell banana, but never knew when to stop." 
 Perhaps it's the sound that gives the word a comical air. "You say ba-NAA-nuh, I say ba-NAH-nuh," goes the lyric to the Gershwin song "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"; it could be the NAA pronunciation that triggers the amusement.
Or it could be the fruit itself, a sunny yellow curved in the shape of a smile, as if to say, "Have a Nice Day." Denuded of its skin, the fruit offers us a banana peel, on which one slips to the great hilarity of onlookers.
In old American slang, banana oil means "nonsense" (its humorous connotation far different from snake oil, meaning "fraudulent"). A top banana is a leading comedian. To go bananas is to go crazy, and the nonsensical meaning is reflected in the verse of another 1930's song, "But Not for Me," from the Gershwins' "Girl Crazy": "I never want to hear/From any cheerful Pollyannas/Who tell you fate/Supplies a mate;/It's all bananas!"
A banana republic was not just a country that produced profits for the United Fruit Company; it was a country with a rinky-dink government, having "backwardness" as its hallmark (until the name was adopted by an American retailer; now it has a yuppie connotation). A banana boat is a very slow boat.
Economists know it's funny, too. When Alfred Kahn, Jimmy Carter's anti-inflation czar, was told by his political superiors never to use the word recession, he agreed to substitute the word banana; he was soon heard muttering about "the worst banana you ever saw."
Perhaps it is the context that gives the word its humor. Let's deal with the word in a serious vein and see if a context of gravity wipes the smile off our face.
A recent front-page article in The New York Times, headlined "A Forbidden Fruit in Europe: Latin Bananas Face Hurdles," dealt with the crisis being felt by banana growers in the face of new quotas and tariffs by the European Community protectionists. That's surely serious, affecting profits, jobs, international relations, calling for all due solemnity.
In a letter to The Times, Daniel R. Katz, executive director of the Rainforest Alliance, swamped the banana growers with additional charges of using pesticides and fertilizers and converting rain forests into "monocultures" (evidently the bugaboo of multiculturalists). He wrote: "My organization has begun a voluntary program called the Smart Banana Project, to work with banana producers in improving their environmental standards without affecting productivity."
This line caused me to fall out of my chair. Why? Surely Mr. Katz's point -- "we support reform of the banana industry, rather than a boycott" -- is a serious one, not funny in the least. Then why do we smile at the prospect of the need for banana reform, and double up in consideration of the Smart Banana Project? If health reform is important, why is not banana reform? If smart bombs are not funny, why are smart bananas? (Just envision those smart bananas, dropped from a banana plane, zeroing in on the banana boycotters in the rain forest; oh, what a lovely war.)
Straighten those faces; let's try again. In the current issue of The International Economy, an article by Klaus C. Engelen, an editor of Handelsblatt in Dusseldorf, is headed "Is Helmut Kohl Cracking Up?" The piece discusses the pervasive Endzeitstimmung, the mood that the regime is coming to an end, and gives five reasons why Chancellor Kohl, though often highly regarded abroad, is so resented at home.
These reasons for the potential downfall of a Western leader range from "For not shutting the borders sooner on floods of asylum seekers" to "For letting bureaucrats from Brussels cause mass layoffs in Germany's steel plants."
Then comes the crusher: "For standing by as the French protect bananas from their former colonies, forcing the Germans to eat expensive, puny, shabby bananas."
Does Kohl realize he is about to be done in by the fallout from puny bananas? Is there a word in the German language for "shabby bananas," and does Helmut Kohl know it?
I rest my case: there is no way of dealing seriously with the Banana Question. Nobody with a straight face is going to fight for banana reform because bananas, smart or shabby, are inherently funny. ("When you get to my age," says octogenarian Milton Berle, "you don't buy green bananas.") Chomsky, get onto this: it must have something to do with the deep structure of the word itself.
 
 
WHENCE WHITE?
 THE WORD WHITE, AS A racial description that used to be euphemized as "Caucasian," is being blackened.
In one of his sprightly, insightful (why am I doing a blurb when he hasn't written a book?) essays in U.S. News & World Report, John Leo addressed "The demonizing of white men." He opened with a grabber of a lead: "Attention, men of the Caucasoid persuasion."
In a Washington Post article about the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Jay Mathews wrote that the F.A.S.B.'s (sometimes pronounced FAS-bee's) "members are drawn from the upper reaches of the accounting profession, and have so far been all male and all European American." My colleague Floyd Norris, in the Times financial news section, notes this usage and wonders: "The new euphemism for white?"
Caucasia is a region between the Black and Caspian Seas that takes in parts of Russia, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and is marked by the Caucasus Mountains. The term Caucasian was used by the German anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach around 1800 to describe whites, who he thought originated there; other 19th-century anthropologists expanded the area to Europe and North Africa, with the people of darker as well as lighter skins, but the whole racial category was abandoned by most scientists a century ago.
What, then, to call people who are not what used to be called black or yellow or brown or red? I see nothing that has to be euphemized about any of those colors, so long as you don't pretend it represents scientific differentiation. White is loosely nearly accurate, though a case can be made for the word chosen by the actor Peter Ustinov when asked his color; he wrote in "pink."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Figuring the Cost of Car Rentals in Europe

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANNON ALBRIGHT; JOHN BRANNON ALBRIGHT is an editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
IF you think air fares are confusing, wait till you contemplate renting a car in Europe. Not only are there a multitude of variables to consider (type of transmission, mileage allowance, insurance coverage, taxes, car size and currency exchange), but there are also such questions as whether to make a reservation, whether to prepay, whether to pay a surcharge for the convenience of picking up the car at the airport and whether to choose longer-term leasing over short-term renting.
Even a survey of only three major rental companies with headquarters in the United States -- Avis, Hertz and National -- opens a can of worms. The companies were asked to supply details on the countries where a visitor to western Europe would be most likely to find the least-expensive economy cars for one week in the summer season and, for comparison, the cost of upgrading to the least-expensive car with automatic transmission. Only two of the three companies gave a breakdown of basic rates and rates with the collision-damage waiver (C.D.W.). Avis offered rates as an inclusive package with unlimited mileage, waiver and tax, or as an exclusive package with unlimited mileage only. All three offered unlimited mileage with a weekly rental; not all do for a one-day rental.
 
The C.D.W. Factor

As most people who have rented cars in the United States know, one complicating factor is the collision- damage waiver (C.D.W.), which is not actually true insurance. The car-rental companies are not selling a policy; they are collecting an extra fee for offering to forgive the cost of any damage. Like the basic car rental rates, the C.D.W. fee can be as much or as little as the traffic will bear. 
 Most major credit-card companies now offer coverage to protect cardholders who decline C.D.W.'s, but it is wise to make sure that the type of card being used has such a feature before deciding that the price of the the waiver -- typically $10 to $20 a day -- will not be a factor in figuring the final cost.
Because all three companies surveyed said that Americans would pay the least if they reserved a car before leaving the United States, packages requiring reservations were used for the following comparison. Avis cited two packages: Super Value, which sounded as if it would be the cheaper, and Discover Europe, which turned out to be the better deal. The name of the Hertz package is Affordable Europe, and the National package is called European Advansaver.
A driver considering either of the Avis plans must make a reservation in North America. For the Discover Europe rate, the reservation must be made at least 14 days before picking up the car; for the Super Value rate, the reservation must be made 48 hours in advance. In both cases, the caller will be quoted a rate in dollars based on the prevailing rate in the country and the exchange rate in effect on the day of the call. But the traveler will not have to prepay. The actual price may vary, however, because of a change in exchange rates by the time the car is picked up. The dollar amount may also be affected by the exchange rate in effect when the final cash or credit-card transaction is completed.
Like the least expensive Avis plan, the cheapest Hertz package also requires a reservation at least 14 days ahead, but the renter must prepay at the time of reserving. The price will be the rate prevailing in local currency on the day of the reservation, converted to dollars at that day's exchange rate.
The National plan also requires a reservation at least 14 days in advance and prepayment at the prevailing local currency rate, converted to dollars at the exchange rate in effect when the reservation is made.
All three companies charge a $50 fee if a reservation is canceled. Hertz also charges a $50 fee if changes are made in a reservation after 48 hours of the original reservation.
Here is how the rates for the three companies compared in late April for a car to be used this summer:
Avis said its least expensive economy-size car (a size above mini, which is generally regarded as too small for extensive travel) was a Volkswagen Polo with manual transmission for $257 in Germany. That rate included the C.D.W. and value added tax (V.A.T.) of 15 percent. Without the waiver, but with tax, it was $143. The next-cheapest Avis car was an Opel Corsa for $269 in Portugal, including the waiver and tax. With tax only, it was $253.
Hertz said its least expensive economy-size car was a Ford Fiesta (manual) for $215, including C.D.W. and 16 percent V.A.T., in Portugal -- but available at that rate only through June 30 and from Oct. 1 through March 31. Without the waiver, but with tax, it was $158. The rate from July 1 through Sept. 30 was $270 with waiver and tax, $253 with tax only. Hertz offers a Ford Fiesta in Belgium with waiver and 19.5 percent V.A.T. at the same price, $270. With tax but without waiver, the price was only $180.
National said its least expensive economy-size car was a Renault Clio (manual) for $223 in Britain. The rate included C.D.W. and V.A.T. of 17.5 percent. With tax only, it was $175. National's rates for a Renault Clio in Portugal through June 31 were $269 with waiver and tax, $180 with tax only. The rates from July 1 through Sept. 30 were $288 with waiver and tax, $220 with tax only.
Travelers who require automatic transmission pay a premium. To upgrade to the least-expensive class with automatic, the comparison showed that Avis would rent a VW Golf in Germany for $474, including C.D.W. and V.A.T. Without the waiver but with tax, it was $336. In Portugal, the Avis rates for an automatic (VW Vento) were $644 with waiver and tax, $588 with tax alone.
The Hertz rates for an automatic (Ford Sierra) in Belgium were $515 with C.D.W. and V.A.T., $378 with tax only. In Portugal rates for an automatic (Ford Orion) in the low season were $573 with waiver and tax, $501 with tax alone. In high season the rates were $645 with waiver and tax, $573 with tax alone.
National's rates for a Renault 19 with automatic in Britain were $354 with C.D.W. and V.A.T., $294 with tax alone. National's low-season rates for an automatic in Portugal (Renault 19) were $488 with waiver and tax, $454 with tax alone. In high season, the rates were $628 and $594, respectively.
One thing to keep in mind about automatics in Europe is that not all rental locations carry midsize or compact models, which means that the driver who insists on an automatic may have to rent a full-size car at much higher rates.
 
Variables Affecting Rates
 Another point to consider is that rates are subject to change. During research for this article, a call was made to Avis for more information, and it was learned that some rates had changed in just two weeks. "All rates are subject to change," the spokeswoman said.
Another factor that will throw off comparison shopping is surcharges at some airports. Austria imposes a 7 percent charge on the total bill. The charge in Brussels is 9 percent, in Italy 10 percent and in Switzerland 6 percent. A flat fee of about $6 is in effect in Germany and about $8 in Amsterdam. Renters wishing to avoid the surcharge will have to pick up their cars at downtown offices.
Those needing a car for more than a week are likely to save money by leasing, since longer-term rates are generally lower than weekly rates, especially starting after two weeks. A Ford Fiesta, for example, is offered by Auto Europe in France for $524 for 14 days and $704 for 21 days. The rates include unlimited mileage, C.D.W. and V.A.T. A similar longer-term arrangement, which works like a lease but is called purchase-repurchase, is offered by some manufacturers. Renault, for example, charges $695 for a Clio for 23 days; this includes C.D.W. No tax is required.
For further information and reservations, here are the numbers to call:
Auto Europe, (800) 223-5555.
Avis, (800) 331-1084.
Hertz, (800) 654-3001.
National, (800) 227-3876.
Renault Eurodrive, (800) 221-1052 and, in the western United States, (800) 477-7116.

HEADLINE: POP MUSIC;
Jazz and Politics Meet Over the Keyboard

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
Gonzalo Rubalcaba was playing "Green Dolphin Street" on a beat-up electric piano at a Havana jazz festival in 1986 when the American bassist Charlie Haden, who has worked with most of the great jazz pianists of the last 30 years, saw him for the first time. He was immediately dazzled. "I fell on the floor and asked, 'Who is that guy,' his solo was so unbelievable," Mr. Haden recalled recently. "He was 23 at the time, but it was like hearing a combination of Art Tatum, Herbie Hancock and Bill Evans."
Since that encounter, which led to a recording contract and invitations with Mr. Haden to perform abroad, musicians and audiences around the world have had much the same response to Mr. Rubalcaba's music, a heady mixture of Latin and classical influences and jazz. 
 The 30-year-old Cuban pianist has been a featured artist at the Montreux Jazz Festival and performed acoustic piano duets with Chick Corea in Japan. Six of his albums have now been released in the United States to critical acclaim and comparisons to keyboard giants like Keith Jarrett and McCoy Tyner; three albums were recorded with his Cuban fusion group Proyecto through the German label Messidor, and three were piano trios released by Blue Note through a licensing agreement with a Japanese label. A new album, "Suites 4 and 20," is due out later this month on Blue Note.
But because of the mutual emnity between the United States and Fidel Castro, Mr. Rubalcaba (pronounced Roo-bal-CA-bah), like other Cuban artists, has never been able to obtain the visa that would allow him to perform in this country.
The Clinton Administration has taken a different tack, however, and on Friday Mr. Rubalcaba will make his American debut at Alice Tully Hall as part of the "Jazz at Lincoln Center" series organized by Wynton Marsalis. Mr. Rubalcaba will play in three different formats -- solo, with Mr. Haden and the drummer Jack de Johnette and as leader of an all-Cuban quartet.
Mr. Rubalcaba still cannot be paid for performances in the United States, and whether the exception granted him will be extended to other Cuban artists remains to be seen. But the magnitude of the moment does not escape him. "It is a political miracle," he said with a grin during an interview at the Santo Domingo apartment where he has lived since last year with his wife, Maria, and two young sons, Joao and Joan.
Cuba hardly ever grants artists the right to live outside the country, to decide when, where or with whom they will perform, or to keep the compensation for their services. That policy of controlling "cultural workers" has contributed to embarrassing defections that have robbed the Castro regime of some of its most prominent artists: the saxophonist Paquito d'Rivera, the trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, the painters Arturo Cuenca and Tomas Esson, and the dancer Jorge Esquivel. But Mr. Rubalcaba is one of Cuba's last internationally recognized cultural treasures and the Government, weakened by growing economic and social problems, has been forced to show unusual flexibility in dealing with him.
"I have not broken with Cuba and do not wish to do so, but neither does my situation follow the habitual model," Mr. Rubalcaba said. "In my specific case, there has been a reciprocal process. I presented myself to the Cuban authorities and told them that this was a time for me to advance my work outside the country, that I needed a space to develop. I had decided that I should be the source of my own economic support, and I told them all the conditions I needed to work, and it produced positive results from the start. I have my family here, but I maintain the connection with my country, which is something important to my work."
As a member of one of Havana's most distinguished musical families, Mr. Rubalcaba is very much aware of, and draws from, his roots in Cuban popular culture. His grandfather, Jacobo, was a conductor and composer remembered today as the author of "El Cadete Constitucional," one of the most famous songs of a style known as danzon. His father, Guillermo, is a well-known pianist who for many years played in the orchestra of Enrique Jorrin, inventor of the cha-cha. As early as age 4, Mr. Rubalcaba joined some of Cuba's finest musicians in jam sessions in his family's living room, playing not piano but his first love, percussion.
"To me at that point, the piano was nothing more than a piece of furniture that decorated the house and at which my older brother sat down to practice five or six hours a day," he said. "What I liked were drums, congas, tambourines, timbales."
By the age of 8, Mr. Rubalcaba was enrolled in a Havana conservatory, where he studied classical piano and Afro-Cuban percussion. He turned professional while still a teen-ager, and by the time he was 20, he had already toured Africa and France as a member of Orquestra Aragon, one of Cuba's most renowned dance bands.
More recently, he has maintained a presence in the pop world through Proyecto and by playing piano on two albums by the Latin music star Juan Luis Guerra and working with salsa and merengue performers in the Dominican Republic, a country he chose as his residence because "the food, the language, the culture, the weather, the racial composition are nearly the same as Cuba's."
In the end, though, Mr. Rubalcaba always comes back to jazz, a form of music eager to absorb Cuban influences. Mr. Rubalcaba was first exposed to swing and be-bop through the 78 r.p.m. records in his father's collection. "I have always been of the opinion that jazz, even more than Cuban music, offers the creative musician the greatest latitude," he said. "It allows one to express oneself with more freedom, and at the moment of sitting down at the instrument it permits a state of virginity that is profoundly refreshing."
Though a formidable composer himself, Mr. Rubalcaba is fond of taking Latin classics like "Besame Mucho" or "Perfidia" -- as well as pop standards ranging from Jerome Kern to the Beatles -- and adapting them to his own eclectic purposes. "These are the hymns of our time and our continent," he said. "They have been performed by so many people in so many different forms. They offer a world of subtleties and a means to recapture a time when melody and theme were dominant."
Mr. Rubalcaba's peers admire his quest for artistic freedom, but some, especially Cuban artists exiled in the United States, criticize his political attitudes. "Gonzalito is an incredible, amazing musician, but he is letting them use him," said Mr. d'Rivera, who is now an American citizen. "What they want is to avoid his escaping, so they give him more freedom than anybody in Cuba has. He is trying to live in two worlds, but the contradictions are too great, and a point comes when no matter how nicely you are treated, you have to be embarrassed to see other people persecuted and dying of hunger. In life, it's more important to live with dignity than to be a great artist."
But Mr. Rubalcaba argues that he is not obliged to conform to the expectations or dogma of either Communist bureaucrats in Havana or their opponents. "I don't think I should play the part of a political functionary," he said. "I wouldn't even know how to dress, much less act, the part. I think the artist does to a certain extent represent the values of a society, but I am not a spokesman for any particular attitudes. The only way I know to speak is through my music."
If the Lincoln Center appearance goes well and Washington permits, Mr. Rubalcaba would like to tour and record in the United States. He would also like to work with American musicians ranging "from Pat Metheny to Al Foster," he says, in an effort to reanimate the traditional dialogue between jazz and Cuban music that began with his idol, Dizzy Gillespie. Can he also imagine living in the country where jazz was born? "I haven't ruled it out, but it's not my decision to make," he said with a cautious smile. "You'll have to ask the State Department about that."

Investor Buys a Major Piece of Stamford

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
ALMOST 20 percent of Stamford's 6.4 million square feet of prime downtown office space has been rescued from foreclosure by Zell/Merrill Lynch of Chicago, one of the nation's largest real estate investment concerns.
With the acquisition last month of 1.2 million square feet in five buildings, for which it paid $132 million, Zell/Merrill Lynch Real Estate Opportunity Partners Limited Partnership became the largest office landlord in Stamford, which has a total of 13.6 million square feet of offices. 
 Most of the newly acquired properties are on Tresser Boulevard: 300 Atlantic Street (on the corner of Atlantic and Tresser), Four Stamford Forum, Six Stamford Forum, and 301 Tresser Boulevard, formerly Eight Stamford Forum and once the headquarters of the Singer Company.
All the structures were built and owned by the F.D. Rich Company, local developers who rebuilt the downtown core under a 1960's urban renewal contract.
Brian Lipson, vice president for Zell/Merrill Lynch acquisitions in Chicago, said that Connecticut was the company's first stop in New England.
"We were waiting for pricing expectations to come into line with market values," he said, "and I suspect that if we had bought these properties earlier we would have paid 20 percent more."
The only Stamford acquisition that was not a Rich property is Canterbury Green, a 100 percent leased office-residential complex that wound up in foreclosure when J.C. Penney, one of the owners, divested itself of its real estate holdings. The Bank of New York sold it, together with 301 Tresser Boulevard, to Zell/Merrill Lynch. The rest of the buildings were bought from Citicorp.
The F.D. Rich family-owned empire began crumbling when overbuilding caught up with it as the recession took hold in the late 80's. Today, of the dozen central-business-district office buildings it once controlled it owns only the 250,000-square-foot Ten Stamford Forum and the 900,000-square-foot Stamford Town Center mall. The rest were taken back by lenders in foreclosures.
Even the Rich company's signature Landmark Towers, an 820,000-square-foot complex of five office buildings that houses the company headquarters, reverted to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which had refinanced the complex in 1989 with $114 million.
Drawing on one of two $430 million acquisition funds comprising investments from some 30 corporate and public pension funds, Zell/Merrill Lynch "seeks to acquire well-located, well-built properties in markets we believe longterm are good places to be," Mr. Lipson said.
The company buys properties at considerably less than their replacement cost, manages them through six regional offices of its affiliate, First Office Management, and holds them for at least 10 years.
Properties are acquired with 50 percent leverage, so the full value is calculated at twice the amount invested, Mr. Lipson said. Citicorp financed 80 percent of the Rich property acquisitions, but "that will be balanced out by cash purchases elsewhere," said Mr. Lipson. The funds were set up in 1987 and 1991 and a third is expected to be capitalized soon at $500 million.
Excluding the new Stamford acquisitions, Zell/Merrill Lynch owns 72 buildings in 22 states. Its holding company, the Equity Group of Chicago, headed by Samuel Zell, owns a total of 250 properties valued at $5 billion, including the partnership's buildings.
ZELL/MERRILL LYNCH first ventured into Connecticut in November 1991 with the purchase of Shelton Pointe, a 162,000-square-foot building in Shelton, at the northern border of Fairfield County.
"A lot of people have invested in Shelton," said Mr. Lipson, citing the American branch of Auguste-Thouard, a major French real estate firm, and Robert Scinto, a Greenwich developer. "We are all having a good experience there."
In 18 months Shelton Pointe's occupancy has risen from 32 percent to 65 percent. Kevin Foley, the building's leasing agent from Rostenberg-Dorn in Stamford, said "outright purchases like this bring stability to the market and peace of mind to the tenants."
Some $500,000 has been spent upgrading the lobby, landscaping and parking area and installing a fitness room and cafeteria.
By early September a new northeast regional headquarters for the Zell/Merrill Lynch partnership will be established in Stamford off the lobby of Six Stamford Forum. Its function will be to acquire and manage properties from Virginia to Maine. Patrick D. Lerch, vice president of First Office Management, will be in charge.
In addition to increasing occupancy of the newly acquired buildings, which are 80 percent occupied and already producing substantial cash flow, Mr. Lerch said that "there will be a lot of hands-on, service-oriented activity. We want to attract retail and amenity tenants as well as office tenants."
HE said that 300 Atlantic Street, with its accessible, windowed ground floor, was well suited to retailers, while the Forum buildings would accommodate interior service businesses for tenants.
Margaret Carlson, a former Rich employee, is now the leasing agent at First Office Management for 300 Atantic Street, and Four and Six Stamford Forum, with an aggregate of 735,500 square feet, of which 24,000 square feet were rented in the past month.
Among the tenants in the five buildings are Price Waterhouse & Company, ABB Financial Services, American Tobacco Company, Re-Capital Corporation, Hewlett Packard's marketing/sales office and Reuters America's regional office.
Albert B. Ashforth Inc. of Stamford handles leasing for 301 Tresser Boulevard. According to Jeffrey H. Gage, a vice president at Ashforth, the 240,000-square-foot building "is half empty and has one of the largest blocks of vacant space available downtown -- floors 12 through 15 containing a total of 90,000 square feet."
Company downsizing has kept vacancies at a persistent 20-plus percent, with rental activity generally sluggish for more than three years. John Rostenberg, a principal at Rostenberg-Dorn, pegs sublease offerings at $12 to $27 a foot and direct space at $17 to $22 a foot. "Landlords are offering lower rent or free rent, but trying to stay away from expensive construction costs," he said.
Mr. Lipson said he believed bargains would continue to be found "even after the recession" because "with all the excess capacity it will be a long time before demand rises enough to push prices up."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: Williamsburg Houses;
A $35 Million Fix For a 1938 Complex

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
IT was one of the triumphal moments of modernism in New York: 12 city blocks of decrepit slums rebuilt into three superblocks of International Style housing.
But although Brooklyn's 1938 Williamsburg Houses did deliver on its promise of a new order of clean cities and factory-style garden apartments, it skipped established lessons of basic construction, and now the New York City Housing Authority is spending $35 million to repair the damage. 
 In 1936, under the direction of the Federal Public Works Administration, the city's Housing Authority began a giant complex of four-story buildings on a site in Williamsburg bounded by Bushwick Avenue and Leonard, Maujer and Scholes Streets. Selecting an architect involved accepting or repudiating modernism, a subject of bitter dispute in the architectural profession.
William Lescaze, a Swiss emigre and exponent of modernism, was chosen to head the architectural team and the resulting design was the first demonstration in the United States of the modern style in mass housing.
Instead of buildings in a long perimeter around a central garden court -- the approach used in the same year at the authority's Harlem River Houses -- the Williamsburg project was divided into 20 separate structures of staggered design and arrangement set at a slight angle to the street and surrounded by grass and playgrounds.
The concrete floor slabs were brought out and made part of the facades. The metal windows, plain brick walls and spare detailing gave the project a definite industrial air. Tenants for the 1,622 units were chosen for job stability and whether their current housing had been built before 1900.
Williamsburg Houses does make a striking and impressive statement against its surroundings of still-decaying wooden houses and walk-up tenements. But two leading critics of the period were not uniformly pleased. Lewis Mumford, writing in The New Yorker under the headline "The New Order," called the architect's contention that the odd angle increased the amount of sunlight "a little silly" and noted that the irregular building outline reduced that advantage.
Talbot Hamlin, writing in Pencil Points, said Williamsburg Houses was "a place where children would be glad to grow up," with landscaping, light, air and planning "better than the most expensive apartments of Park Avenue." But he also criticized the mechanical regularity of the design and the "shameful" construction, noting "walls full of water" and other problems.
"If we cannot build well in the newest and most loudly advertised ways, let us build well in the older, proven ways" he wrote.
Now is a good time to tour Williamsburg Houses. It still has a radically progressive atmosphere. But it also has giant scars along its brick walls and especially the concrete slabs. The water that Hamlin saw in the 30's continued to penetrate the outer walls. Perhaps a tenth of the bricks have spalled off badly and the rest are deteriorating. Internal steel reinforcing bars have rusted, popping off grapefruit-size chunks of concrete.
THE Federal P.W.A. construction workers were inexperienced and not supervised closely enough. They laid the steel reinforcing too close to the edge of the forms into which the concrete was poured.
But there was also a basic design problem: Lescaze's team left out the normal devices -- flashing and weepholes -- that permit internal water to escape. Rainwater was drawn into the wall at the bottom of each of the chamfered, concrete slabs, which did not have the ridge-like drip caps at the bottom.
Neil Cohen, director of design for the Housing Authority, feels strongly about the architectural significance of Williamsburg Houses and the authority has, voluntarily, approached the Landmarks Preservation Commission for approval of its project.
The buildings are widely considered notable works, but are not designated landmarks. The concrete slabs will be rebuilt, with drip caps, and the modernistic entranceways are restored to something like their original appearance. Every brick will be removed and replaced with new ones to match, about 5.7 million in all, says Douglas McNevin, assistant director of construction.
Most of the repairs are being designed by the engineers Goodkind and O'Dea, and the landmarks issues are being supervised by the architects Vincek & Petrocci.
Two recent alterations -- inappropriate new windows and crudely designed brick replacement on the stair towers -- will not be remedied, but the Williamsburg Houses are notable for the promises its original architects envisioned and the ones its current owners did not have to make.

HEADLINE: Officials Seek to Widen Jury-Duty Lists

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
A RECENT survey by the Eagleton Institute of Politics shows that 63 percent of those summoned for jury duty in the state never actually serve. Included in that figure, some legal experts say, are many people who never respond to jury summonses.
What causes such numbers, experts say, are legal exemptions from jury duty, based on occupation, and lists that are inadequate to identify all potential jurors. In addition, thousands of residents simply disregard the summonses and are never pursued. 
 As a result, and in an effort to develop larger juror pools, the State Assembly is considering legislation that would eliminate all occupational exemptions from jury service and raise the fees paid to jurors. Meanwhile, court officials in some counties are threatening people who ignore their jury summonses with sanctions including fines and jail.
"We're losing more people than we should be losing," said Michael Garrahan, chief of the technical assistance unit of the Administrative Office of the Courts. "I think we're going to have to try a little harder."
Under current law, Mr. Garrahan said, jury panels in criminal and civil trials are chosen from juror pools made up of residents summoned by the Superior Court in the county in which they live. In New Jersey, jurors must be United States citizens without criminal records between 18 and 75 years old.
The names of prospective jurors, Mr. Garrahan said, are drawn from two statewide lists: one of registered voters and one of licensed drivers. He said those two lists were used because they provided court officials with the broadest compilation of names possible. "I guess the original intention would be to have everyone eligible for jury service," he said.
The two lists are merged into one by court officials in each county, who then draw names of potential jurors from the merged list.
But some officials say that doesn't insure that everyone eligible for jury service will be on the list.
"I know people who neither vote nor drive," said Lois Powers, jury manager for Gloucester County. "That lets out a lot of people."
Ms. Powers, and other jury managers interviewed, say it is impossible to estimate the number of eligible residents who are not summoned because their names do not appear on either of the two lists.
But that, Ms. Powers said, is only part of the problem. In many cases, she said, summoning prospective jurors is no guarantee that they will actually serve.
"We summon 300 jurors a day," she said. "And out of those 300 people we yield approximately 100 eligible jurors."
The 200 other people, she said, are excused for various reasons, the most common being statutory exemptions.
"A lot of people are exempt," Ms. Powers said, including police officers, fish and game wardens, hospital workers and people with minor children and no one else to care for them.
Legal exemptions reduce the juror pool by nearly two-thirds in some counties, but officials face another problem.
"I would say that word has gotten out that in New Jersey nothing is done if you don't show up for jury duty," Ms. Powers said.
In Gloucester County, she said, between 20 and 25 percent of those summoned and deemed eligible to serve fail to show up.
"Unfortunately, we're all understaffed," Ms. Powers said. "I would say that the solution would be that if they did not show up after two warnings, a warrant should be issued to appear before the assignment judge. But as yet, nothing of that nature has been done."
Martin L. Haines, a retired assignment judge from Burlington County, agreed that little is done about people who ignore jury summonses. Mr. Haines, who is now director of the Institute for Law and Justice Inc., a nonprofit public interest organization, said his organization had commissioned a study of the state court system by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.
Included in the study, conducted at the end of 1992, were questions on jury service that revealed that 44 percent of those summoned did not report and that 19 percent reported but did not serve.
"That sounded pretty poor indeed," Mr. Haines said, adding that he had written a column about the problem in a recent issue of The New Jersey Law Journal. "My column said that no one was really doing much about it," he said. "And neither did I when I was the assignment judge."
The main reason that court officials in some counties do not pursue those who fail to appear for jury duty is cost.
"Mailing costs for jury summonses are pretty high," Mr. Haines said. "It wouldn't take very many mailings to ruin your budget."
 
Many Incorrect Addresses
 But there is another reason, he said. "We, too, make mistakes," he said. "The addresses we have for people aren't always correct. I've brought people into court who didn't show up for grand jury and I ended up embarrassed," he said, explaining that the notices had been mailed to the wrong addresses.
"I hauled them in and wasted a half a day of their time, and it was really because our records weren't current," he said.
Officials in most counties provide prospective jurors with two notices for jury service. The first is a form questionnaire to determine eligibility; the second, a jury summons or a follow-up if the form isn't returned. If the person doesn't report for duty, or fails to respond to the two notices, officials may issue an arrest warrant.
But that threat is rarely followed through, officials say.
"They don't even arrest fugitives from justice," said John Cannel, executive director of the New Jersey Law Revision Commission, a state commission reviewing the state's laws.
"In the old days, you would believe that if you didn't fill out the form, lightning would strike you," Mr. Cannel said. "Nowadays, what are you going to get, a couple of warnings?"
 
Undermining of System Seen
 Mr. Cannel said blatant disregard of summonses and legal exemptions from service undermined the jury system.
"If you have to impanel a jury for a 12-week trial, are you really going to get a cross section of the community?" he said. "Who can give up their life for 12 weeks? Who can give up their job for 12 weeks? What you're getting are people who are retired and people who are on unemployment."
Defense lawyers agree.
"The younger people are scared to serve," said Walter Lucas, a former deputy attorney general now in private practice in Eatontown. "They say, 'If I miss two weeks of work, my boss will fire me,' " he said. Since that concern is insufficient for an exemption, the judge will typically require the juror to serve. But that, Mr. Lucas said, can cause problems for litigants.
"Do I want to risk having someone on the jury who is so preoccupied about losing their job that they won't follow the evidence?" he said.
 
Concern Over Neutrality
 Marcia Wenk, acting legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, agreed.
"One of the fundamentals we rely on in using juries is that they will be impartial and willing to serve," Ms. Wenk said. "If they are disgruntled, there is less of a likelihood that they will put aside biases and be neutral at the outset."
Small pools of prospective jurors, Ms. Wenk said, put added strain on the system.
"It means that many jurors are called more than once, and it places a greater burden on those willing to serve," she said. Moreover, she said, the current system of compiling prospective juror lists from drivers' licenses and voter registrations might also skew juror pools racially and economically.
"It will often exclude people from urban centers and minority jurors, because I think there is a very low voter registration rate in the minority community in some urban areas," she said, adding that the use of driver's license lists somewhat makes up for that shortcoming.
 
A Lack of Resources
 Mr. Cannel of the law revision commission said the current system was failing because it did not provide a broad enough pool of jurors, and because officials did not have the resources to enforce every jury summons that was ignored.
"It isn't that they don't want to know the answers," Mr. Cannel said. "It's just that they haven't gotten around to really figuring out what's going on."
One way to enlarge the juror pool, he said, is to eliminate the statutory exemptions. His commission has proposed legislation that would do just that. That legislation, he said, sponsored by Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, Democrat of Fort Lee, is now on second reading before the Assembly.
Another bill, now before the State Senate Judiciary Committee, would increase the fees jurors are paid to $20 a day from $5.
Mr. Cannel said another way to increase the juror pool was to use other lists in addition to the registered voter and driver's license lists. One possibility would be those who file state income tax returns.
Even better, he said, would be lists of people on unemployment, welfare and Social Security. But those lists, he said, are not available because of Federal privacy laws.

 
'All the Excusing'
 Yet another way to increase the pool of prospective jurors, officials say, is to make sure that those who are summoned actually show up.
"We summon 400 jurors a week," said Elizabeth Domingo, assistant administrator of jury management for Hudson County. "But after all the excusing and postponing prior to the reporting date, we're down to half that many. Then, on the first reporting date, about 20 percent fail to report."
But rather than let that 20 percent fall through the cracks, Ms. Domingo said, court officials in Hudson County are tracking them down.
"After check-in, we pull the names of those who fail to report, and we call them," she said. If a person cannot be contacted by telephone, she said, a county sheriff's officer is dispatched to the person's home to find out why he failed to appear and to suggest that he contact the jury manager's office immediately.
"For those who still fail to respond, we send them 'contempt of court' letters," Ms. Domingo said, explaining that a contempt of court charge for ignoring a jury summons can result in a fine.
And in the event that doesn't work, she said, officials in Hudson County are now establishing a procedure whereby the assignment judge of the county can issue an order requiring an individual to appear before him to explain the reason the jury summons went unanswered. If the person fails to appear before the assignment judge, Ms. Domingo said, the judge can issue a bench warrant for the person's arrest.
"We haven't arrested anybody," Ms. Domingo said. "But we do go after them. We work on them on a daily basis."

HEADLINE: Jersey City Journal;
After Fires, Neighbors Seek to 'Pull Together'

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
THE effect of the four-alarm blaze that swept through the Bergen Hill historic district here early last month wasn't limited to the damage to eight Victorian row houses. Residents say the fire left a legacy beyond charred wooden beams, broken windows boarded over with cheap plywood and roofs mangled as if from the bite of a giant predator.
The fierce blaze, they say, also damaged a sense of confidence and security they had gained over the years. On Astor Place, the brick houses had been a monument to bygone days when drugs were sold only from pharmacies and the sound of sirens accompanied horse-drawn fire wagons, not the police. 
 "People around here have worked long and hard for what they have and beyond the financial investment in this area, what we have is pride," said Dennis G. Doran, a real-estate manager and treasurer of the Bergen Hill Neighborhood Association. "Something like this is a setback for us, but sometimes out of the ashes, greater things arise."
 
A Renewal of Respect
 "This crisis has motivated people to pull together," said Mary McLean Bateman, president of the Astor Place Block Association. "A tragedy like this, it renews the respect we have for our own homes and those who live here. The problem is that some surrounding this area don't have the same kind of respect for what we own and have worked so long and hard for."
Early on April 6, fire broke out in a vacant building at 25 Astor Place and quickly spread to an adjoining vacant building. Before the fire was put out by 20 fire units from Jersey City and elsewhere, eight buildings were damaged, five severely. Forty residents were evacuated, and nine families were given temporary shelter by the Hudson County chapter of the American Red Cross, said Joseph P. Lecowitch, the chapter's director.
The cause of the blaze is still under investigation, but residents suspect arson, since one of the two vacant buildings had burned the week before. Even though damage was limited at the time, for some residents the incident served as a harbinger.
 
Residents Join Cleanup
 On April 24, both neighborhood associations sponsored a blockwide cleanup of the area in which several dozen residents loaded fire debris into a rented trash container for hauling. Children played in the street, which was blocked off to traffic, while parents sought to repair the scars of fire damage.
The neighborhood groups, which also sponsored picnics and flea markets to raise cleanup money, ended the day with a potluck dinner and a forum open to City Council candidates. They also boarded up the damaged buildings against looting.
"As we're working, we noticed a couple of burglars exiting the rear of one damaged building with TV sets in their arms," Mr. Doran said with a shake of his head. "Mary Bateman wound up chasing after them, following them home and calling the police. Amazing!"
Recalling the incident, Ms. Bateman said, "We just want people to have a little respect and mercy for what we're trying to do here."
 
Neighborhood Block Watches
 Both neighborhood groups, which have 50 active members, also conduct neighborhood block watches.
"Someone sees something out of place, someone suspicious, it's our responsibility to call the police," Mr. Doran said. "We look out for our own interests because what affects one in this neighborhood, well, it affects us all."
Mr. Doran and other residents said the vacant buildings had long been a source of trouble.
Dealers have sold drugs from the buildings' entranceways. Police patrols scattered the drug traffic only temporarily, residents said, and when the sun set, the dealers returned.
"Just over a year ago, the problem got so bad that we needed to take some kind of action," Mr. Doran said. "A little light on the subject we felt couldn't hurt."
The Bergen Hill Association contracted with the Public Service Electric and Gas Company and installed a spotlight across the street that illuminated the two vacant buildings. It cost $20.40 a month, but "it was money well spent," Mr. Doran said, and the drug dealers moved on.
But they didn't move very far: nearby vacant buildings drew addicts and transients and accounted for an increase in burglaries and break-ins along the tree-lined streets in the shadow of the Jersey City Medical Center.
 
'I'm Going to Rebuild'
 But residents say the fire and its aftermath have brought many closer together in an effort to rebuild the neighborhood and their sense of security.
"My plans?" Russell L. Franklin said. "I'm going to rebuild, and while it's not going to be easy, it's something that I have to do." Mr. Franklin is a data-processing consultant who, in addition to his home, owns an adjacent building on Astor Place that was severely damaged by the fire. He said the building, a rental property with two apartments, was inherited from an uncle, who purchased it in the 1980's.
"He put a lot of work into that building, a whole lot of work with his own hands, and for that alone I don't want to see it go to waste," he said, estimating the damage at more than $100,000.
Some residents forced out by the blaze have returned because, they say, they have nowhere to go. Others, like Kathryn E. Landrigan, a Jersey City native and assistant controller for a women's-wear company, say that adversity brought on by the blaze can be overcome if one is resilient.
"Well, let's see," Ms. Landrigan said. "We don't have any electricity, the back of our house is burned and there's lots of smoke and water damage, but we'll get through this. It's nothing that can't be repaired." On the positive side, she said, there is still running water, and neighbors have been generous with help.
"In lots of ways, it's kind of like we've been camping out," Ms. Landrigan said. "My boyfriend and I have been showering by flashlight. It's kind of romantic, I suppose, but I want things back to normal."
While most residents have fire insurance, the cost of rebuilding the structures may exceed insurance outlays. In the case of the vacant building where the fire began -- its owner, neighbors say, has not been heard from in years -- rebuilding is an anxious question. Residents and neighborhood association officials hope that city funds earmarked for historic district preservation will be released for reconstruction, but applications, eligibility, hearings and red tape, they say, do not make for quick and easy solutions.
Earl Morgan, an Astor Place homeowner and columnist for The Jersey Journal, who lives down the street from the site of the fire, said that no matter what, the neighborhood would survive, because unlike other communities, the residents have roots they have chosen not to ignore.
 
'A Sense of Stability'
 "This block is different because there is a sense of stability here," said Mr. Morgan, who bought his row house some 12 years ago and who grew up around the block. "People know people here. They've spent their entire lives here. There's something to be said for that."
Mr. Doran says that neighbors working together in the Bergen Hill district have been its salvation, that pride in its history and accomplishments has its own kind of legacy.
The area, he said, was developed in the early 1880's, when Bernard Vetterlein, a wealthy cigar importer, died and his large estate was divided among heirs and sold off. Developers built 125 row houses on land bordering Summit Avenue and Astor Place to meet the needs of the factory workers who made up a majority of the city's population. In the 1960's and 70's, a failing regional economy forced the sale of some buildings to landlords who divided once grand dwellings into squalid illegal apartments.
 
'Things Turned Around'
 "Things turned around in the 1980's because people reinvested in the neighborhood and its history," Mr. Doran said. His own three-story row house, which he bought and renovated nearly 10 years ago, had at one time been divided into a dozen crude units.
For Angel E. Sanchez, who has rented an apartment on Astor Place for the last two years, the devastation across the street does not compare to other places he has known.
"What happened here we can come back from, because people have the will in their hearts to bring it back," Mr. Sanchez said. "Here they have taken a stand, and in other places where I have lived, like the South Bronx when people lose pride, their neighborhoods are gone forever."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
For Coffee, the Slump Goes On

BYLINE: By James Brooke

DATELINE: RIO DE JANIERO

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the average Brazilian coffee grower is tearing out bushes with both hands, large crops this year of Brazilian robusta coffee beans as well as Colombian arabicas are expected to prolong a slump in world coffee prices.
While worldwide coffee consumption is climbing slowly, thanks to Asia's newly affluent nations, per capita consumption in the United States and Brazil has been cut almost in half over the last 30 years. 
 In London last month, talks collapsed in the latest effort to re-establish an agreement between producing and consuming nations meant to smooth supply and pricing patterns.
Now, with prices already weak, everything depends on what producer countries do in coming months with their huge inventories. Last year, Colombia aggressively sold inventories, pushing its total export sales to a record 16.5 million sacks. This season, attention has turned to Brazil, with its coffee mountain of 17.5 million sacks.
"Sale of Government stocks in 1993 is out of the question," said Orlando Correa, president of the Coffee Trade Center, a private group that represents Brazilian exporters. "A quantitative and qualitative audit will have to be made of the inventory, and the audit will take six months."
Should Brazil indeed continue to hold stocks off the market, Colombia could well surpass Brazil in volume sales this year, snatching away a crown worn throughout this century by "King Coffee."
But since Brazilian coffee has been fetching as little as 40 cents a pound on world markets, the lowest price in inflation-adjusted terms since the early 1800's, and a far cry from the record $3.09 a pound posted in 1977, the question is whether it is worthwhile to sell. Only four years ago, prices were in the $1.15 to $1.50 range.
Prices are expected to remain depressed for another year, largely because of the large Brazilian and Colomian inventories, and because current production is close to worldwide demand. Meanwhile, while producers are stuck in the price basement, coffee roasters and retailers have resisted lowering what they charge consumers. Instead, most retailers have been pocketing greater profits.
The worst may be over for the growers, experts say, but a rebound is another matter. "Coffee is pretty much near the bottom of the commodity cycle now," said Lawrence Eagles, an analyst in London for GNI Ltd., a futures broker. "But a price shift in favor of the producer probably won't come for 18 months or two years," when the twin effects of lower prices and a shrinking crop finally lead to a shortage and a price rebound.
Here in Brazil, still the world's largest grower, the coffee outlook for now is bleak.
With production costs running almost 40 percent higher than world prices, growers have reduced the number of bushes by almost a quarter, to 3.2 billion today, from 4.2 billion in 1989, when an international agreement between coffee producers and consumers collapsed. In addition to replacing coffee bushes with orange or rubber trees, Brazilian growers have also cut back on the care of remaining coffee bushes.
"There has been inadequate crop care for three years," said Dean R. Burquist, a technical consultant to the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters. "There is no question that people are investing less in coffee trees."
At the same time, Brazil's economy no longer revolves around King Coffee. In 1952, Brazil depended on coffee for 74 percent of its export revenues. Last year, Brazil's coffee exports, a total of $1.1 billion, accounted for a mere 4 percent of the total.
"Brazilian coffee cultivation lacks Government attention -- credit and financing," said Oswaldo Aranha Neto, president of the coffee federation.
Late last month, a Brazilian official briefed reporters here on an $860 million plan to revive the coffee sector but no Rio newspapers carried a story about the plan, either because of a general lack of interest in coffee affairs or because of skepticism that the Government would actually deliver the money to growers.
This year, good weather is expected to swell Brazil's coffee crop about 10 percent over last year's level, hitting 24 million 132-pound sacks.
Further postponing a shortage that would lift prices off the floor, a good crop is also expected in Colombia, the world's No. 2 producer.
Colombian coffee is cossetted by by the Government in Colombia, where about 20 percent of the people now depend on the crop for their livelihood. Despite the 1989 collapse of the International Coffee Agreement, a Government subsidy program in Colombia pushed that nation's annual crop up 42 percent, to 17 million bags last year, from 12 million.
With a million jobs at stake in a violence-prone nation, Colombia's National Coffee Fund, which adminsters the Government's support program, has spent $1 billion over the four years to prop up producer prices. The subsidies and an aggressive marketing campaign enabled Colombia to expand its world market share to 22 percent today, from 14 percent in 1989.
"Now the question is: is Colombia going to keep on subsidizing?" asked Mr. Aranha. To ease the hemorrhage of subsidy money, Colombia's National Coffee Federation, which buys from the growers, has started a modest program of paying farmers to eradicate unproductive and diseased coffee plots.

THE ECONOMY
 
Job Growth Stalls, but New Jersey Screeches Into Reverse 

The week's top story? That depends. If you have a job, it's probably Bosnia; if you don't, it's probably unemployment. That story changed little last week -- except, say, in New Jersey. April's national jobless rate stalled at 7 percent, with businesses adding just 119,000 new jobs. But in New Jersey, the rate soared to 9.1 percent, from 8.3 in March and 7.4 as recently as January. That's the highest rate of the 11 most populous states. Even elsewhere, though, job growth is nothing to cheer about: gains have merely kept pace with population growth. Total jobs still fall more than a million short of the pre-recession peak of 119 million. So where does this leave the Administration, as the Bush economy slowly becomes the Clinton economy? Some see bad news and said the pressure was on to create jobs. But Laura Tyson, the top Administration economist, called the report "neutral to positive."
 
A Payroll Tax to Pay the Doctor?
 
It's simple to rebuild a health care system: just decide who foots the bill. The Clinton team could be close to that crucial decision. Administration officials said last week that employers could be asked to pay up to 7 percent of payrolls, with the premiums going to regional groups to buy coverage in bulk. This would smooth out some bumps in the price of health care, lowering costs for old-line industries heavy with retirees, while getting more from smaller companies. Of course, no matter how the plan works out, strong opposition is expected. In a pre-emptive strike at critics, President Clinton asked the nation "not to let the special interests spook and scare" Congress from "our manifest duty."
 
He won't ask that it be done just yet, though. Letting the deficit talk have center stage for now, the Administration will not send the health plan to Congress till June.
 
U.S. Joins the Rush to Refinance
 
Borrowers nationwide are cashing in on low interest rates -- often by refinancing a mortgage. So naturally the biggest borrower of all -- the Federal Government -- wants to get in on the action. When the Treasury borrows money for 30 years, it pays a lot more interest than for just a few years. So last week it slashed sales of 30-year bonds nearly in half and said it would sell more two- and three-year notes. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the move would "produce real savings" and "is in the best interests of American taxpayers." But critics called it a gamble that short-term rates would stay low -- and said it was a bad bet. "It will cost the taxpayer money over time," one economist said.
 
Lobbyists' Gifts, Unwrapped
 
Most Americans often want to tell senators a thing or two, and about 10,000 of them do it for a living -- they're called lobbyists. A free dinner here, tickets to a baseball game there -- all legal, all secret, all to get a senator's ear. This practice has angered many people, and last week, against all odds, a reformer had his day. Citing what he saw as "systemic corruption," Paul Wellstone, a first-term Minnesota Democrat with a mission, proposed forcing lobbyists to report any gift worth more than $20. Comfortable habits die hard, so his colleagues resisted fiercely -- but when the showdown came, they followed like lambs. Seeing the drawbacks of open opposition to such an apple-pie issue, senators ducked, debated only briefly and passed the proposal quickly.
 
Putting Housing Bias to a Test
 
Study after study has shown it: Bias -- racial and otherwise -- is widespread in mortgage lending. One way to try to root it out is to send Federal agents to pose as borrowers and see how they're treated. Those who call for tough enforcement of fair-housing laws have long sought such testers, but bankers -- who stand to be embarrassed, or worse -- insist they're unreliable. Last week the Clinton Administration, to the cheers of consumer groups, decided to try testers. "It's very exciting," said Deepak Bhargava of the lobbying group Acorn. "It is a real, marked departure from the previous Administration's posture."
 
Open. Cook. Cook Some More.
 
Ground beef clearly needs no instruction book. Think again. Three recent deaths and many illnesses from tainted meat got the Agriculture Department's attention, and last week it said all raw meat and poultry must have cooking instructions. The next battle: what the labels will say. They could be warnings, plunging drumsticks into a class with cigarettes (which have no healthy uses), or instructions. "These will not be warning labels," insisted the American Meat Institute, but "care labels." But one consumer advocate called it the "dumbest thing I ever heard of" not to say why the label's there. Warning or no, one hopes a hamburger will be easier to operate than a VCR.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Chrysler Pro to I.B.M.'s Rescue
 
The help-wanted ad was daunting: Take the financial reins of a corporate giant lurching from crisis to crisis and persuade a highly skeptical Wall Street that you know which end is up. Experience should include performing this impossible task at another leviathan on the brink. Where else to turn but Chrysler, the decade's comeback kid? And that's just what I.B.M. did last week, plucking away Jerome B. York, who helped put the auto maker on its $3 billion diet, to be its chief financial officer. Taking on I.B.M.'s troubles, Mr. York said -- understating the case in the extreme -- will be "one of the most challenging business situations in the 90's."
 
He Put Wine on America's Table
 
Ernest & Julio Gallo. It's a brand name that has become part of the language, but last week the words took on a very human face when Julio, 83, was killed in a Jeep accident on a family ranch. The winery was born when Prohibition ended, in 1933. And the business the brothers built -- Julio was the president, Ernest the chairman -- was staggering in its success: this family makes one of every four glasses of wine this country pours.
 
Boesky Asks for Pocket Money
 
He'd done his time, his wife had split, and he needed a bit of her money to tide him over. What sum did Ivan Boesky have in mind? Oh, $20,000 a week ought to do it. Failing that, it was the flophouse for sure. (Such numbers were not unheard of in the courtroom: Ivana Trump and her husband had severed their ties within the same walls.) But last week Mr. Boesky started to talk real money. His wife, Seema, is worth -- in terrifyingly round numbers -- $100 million, and he was in court demanding half. Never mind where the money came from. What did Mrs. Boesky have to say? "My husband was a rat."
 
Donald Trump, Underdog
 
Donald Trump is now a victim of discrimination -- or so he seems to say in a Federal lawsuit. A 1988 law has enabled Indian tribes in various states to open casinos, and Mr. Trump and his Atlantic City colleagues are not at all happy about the competition. Now, some unhappy people see therapists, some go to court; Mr. Trump went to court. His suit contends that the 1988 law gives an advantage to "a very limited class of citizens" (Indians) at the expense of others (Mr. Trump, for instance). Mr. Trump may have been moved to act because the issue could soon be on his doorstep: New Jersey's Ramapough Indians are edging toward a gambling pact. And that tribe's reaction to Mr. Trump? Says a Ramapough lawyer: "This guy is unbelievable."
 
New Blow for Empire Blue Cross
 
Troubles keep piling up for Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. It lost $250 million on its insurance business in 1991 and 1992. Its reserves are dangerously low. Congress is looking into possible management problems across the Blue Cross organization. And last week the Government said its handling of $1.7 billion in Medicare claims was "abysmal" and that its contract might be canceled, which would mean a $63 million loss. For its part, Empire pinned part of the blame on a new computer system and said much of its processing had improved.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
What Price Human Rights?
 
President Clinton wants better human rights in China. Can he afford it? He must decide soon whether to extend most-favored-nation trading status -- campaigning, he'd said that would hinge on human rights. But as he's learning regularly, compromise is inevitable, and everything has a price. The price here: China buys an awful lot of stuff in this country -- jets, cars, oil-drilling gear -- and these purchases create 150,000 domestic jobs. The Chinese have raised the ante recently, going on a $1 billion spending spree, to make it as costly as possible for Mr. Clinton to cut them off.
 
While many companies are eager to trade with China, others balk. Levi Strauss said it was ending most business in China, citing "pervasive violation of human rights."
 
East Germans Present I.O.U.'s
 
For Germany, the cost of unity rises relentlessly. Workers in the east get about half what those in the west earn, and the Government promised to reduce that gap. But now employers say that with the nation's deepening woes, they just can't afford it. So last week thousands of steelworkers and metalworkers went on strike in the east, demanding what was promised. "This is not just about money," one strike leader said. "People here have simply had enough of the broken promises and lies that have followed unity."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Going Long: Bond Buyers Are Sanguine

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
There is no better indication of the confidence of a society in its industrial and financial system than its willingness to buy truly long-term bonds. It takes a lot of trust to lend money for 30 years or more on fixed terms. You have to believe the issuer will be around, and capable of repaying, for all that time, and you have to believe that the currency in question will retain its value.
By that standard, American confidence is growing, but it is not even close to the level it once reached. Both Texaco and Boeing have sold 50-year bonds this year, hitting a maturity that had not been seen for decades. The companies are betting that the current level of long-term interest rates is a bargain for issuers; buyers are hoping the reverse is true. Texaco hedged its bet by reserving the right to buy back the bonds in 20 years, but there is no such provision in the Boeing issue. 
 The peak in long-term confidence came more than a century ago, when some railroads were able to issue 999-year bonds. One such bond, issued by a company since acquired by the Canadian Pacific, is still paying 4 percent interest and is supposed to continue doing so until 2883.
The assumption that the rails would be around, and able to repay, for 10 centuries seems amazing now, but no more than the assumption that the currency would not depreciate. (Those bonds were usually denominated in gold, but governments effectively erased that protection during the Depression.)
Today, investors seem sanguine about risks. Jessica Palmer, the co-head of capital markets at Salomon Brothers, which underwrote the 50-year bonds, says that investors demanded only a tenth of a percentage point or less in extra yield to compensate them for the risk of going out 50 years rather than 30.
That spread seems a bit low, notwithstanding the fact that the buyers of the Boeing issue have profited as prices rose in the past month. After all, a lot can happen -- to a company and a currency -- in half a century. In 1943, Boeing had yet to build its first jet, and a dollar could buy 10 copies of The Sunday New York Times. The top ticket for the Broadway hit "Oklahoma" was $2.75 and long-term interest rates were under 3 percent. It proved to be a great time to issue long-term bonds, and a bad time to buy them.
While corporations now are eager to issue more long-term bonds, the Government has decided to cut back by selling fewer 30-year issues and more securities that mature in less than three years. If rates keep falling, that will be a wise move for the Government.
Unfortunately for the taxpayers, the Government's record as a bond-market timer is poor. It was just after World War II that it began to rely more on short-term borrowing, thus reducing the average maturity of Government debt. During the 1980's, the Government raised the amount it was borrowing on a long-term basis. In neither case was the decision a wise one, at least in terms of minimizing the Government's total interest payments.

HEADLINE: Downtown's Empty Feeling

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
It was once a proud building, as the gilded mosaic over one entrance testifies: An angel grasping a lightning bolt, symbol of technology's mastery over that era, adorns 67 Broad Street, built to house ITT's headquarters in 1928. But now, the 33-story lower Manhattan building is three-fourths empty, the mosaic entrance is unused, and the building was foreclosed upon in January.
Across the way, at 80 Broad Street, a whimsical quartet of metal seahorses hovers over the entrance of the stately 36-story building, which is 51 percent vacant. 
 This stretch of Broad Street, at the heart of New York's financial district, is eerily serene. The overbuilding of the 1980's, coupled with the city's economic problems and a wave of relocations to newer and better-equipped buildings in midtown, has left downtown's older buildings simply desperate. It is a tale echoed in many parts of lower Manhattan, as in downtown areas across the country.
In New York, the vast swaths of empty office space pose a stark problem for the owners of older buildings, as well as for city officials. Even as the economy recovers, the downtown vacancy rate has continued to rise, and no one is sure when -- or whether -- job growth will resume, increasing demand for offices.
The optimists speak of renovations that will make the buildings desirable again, or of converting the buildings into apartments or hotels. Others say that many can never be saved, and will have to be demolished. Such decisions, it seems clear, will be based not only on job growth, but on whether owners -- with or without public aid -- can invest enough to help bring a turnaround.
"It would really be a crime to lose them," said Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. "A number of them are architecturally significant, and they also tell the history of the development of the city, of New York as a skyscraper town. These canyons of stone shouldn't just be left to be rubble."
THE problems for the city are financial as well as esthetic.
"The City of New York stands to lose as much as half a billion dollars a year in tax collections if the decline in values continues unabated in lower Manhattan," said John H. Alschuler Jr. of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, a policy and management consulting firm. He said that figure represents about one-sixteenth of the city's property tax income. "The government needs to intervene constructively in order to preserve the property tax base that supports vital services needed by city residents."
For many owners, the problem is complicated by the fact that the vacancy rate is so high in the older buildings that money cannot be found for extensive renovations. This, in turn, affects their ability to rent space.
In the part of Manhattan roughly south of Chambers Street and the Brooklyn Bridge, the "secondary" or less desirable buildings -- a group that includes unrenovated older structures -- were 26.4 percent vacant as of March 31, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage and management company. In the middle stretch of Broad Street, a corridor anchored at one end by the New York Stock Exchange and at the other by the relatively new headquarters of Goldman, Sachs, the rate could be as high as 45 percent, the brokerage Edward S. Gordon estimates.
While the New York City figures are among the worst in the nation, other cities also face an overhang of empty space in older, less desirable buildings. In Dallas, secondary buildings are 39.1 percent vacant, according to Cushman & Wakefield, and in Philadelphia, the figure is 24.7 percent.
Along Broad Street, owners have not given up, despite long odds and huge costs.
For example, at 67 Broad, the Principal Financial Group of Des Moines, Iowa, has taken over the 544,000-square-foot structure and is studying what to do. "We'd like to fix it up a little bit and lease it up," said Steve Franzenburg, a director of the investment department at Principal Financial.
Deciding what to do is not easy. Many of these buildings need upgrades in their power capacity to accommodate computer wiring; the changes may require raised floors or dropped ceilings that make the work space unacceptably tight. Some need asbestos removal, air-conditioning work and upgrades or replacements for their lobbies and poky, shabby elevators. Also, there are potential problems in complying with the Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires easy access to entrances and lavatories.
Many of these problems can be fixed with enough money, but some cannot. Larger prospective tenants look for open space, with no columns or existing offices, and floor sizes of between 25,000 and 40,000 square feet, which is unusual in older buildings. They also want floors in regular rectangles or squares -- shapes that cannot be found in older buildings where the layout may be triangular (because of downtown's irregular streets) or H-shaped (to help air circulation in the days before air conditioning).
"The lobby you can modernize, the air conditioning you can modernize, the electrical system you can modernize -- but you can't change the size and shape of the building," said Raymond T. O'Keefe, head of the downtown office of the Edward S. Gordon brokerage.
A make-over is a tough job. A year ago, Galbreath Riverbank, a Manhattan real estate company, started work for GE Investments in renovating 14 Wall Street, a 960,000-square-foot, 37-story, pyramid-topped tower built in 1912 by Bankers Trust and expanded in 1932. Bankers Trust is still a major tenant in the building, which is 80 percent leased.
John V. Wheeler, who is in charge of the renovation for Galbreath Riverbank, said the work on the vacant space and common areas of the building, which is around the corner from the troubled stretch of Broad Street, would cost about $15.6 million. The project is to be completed later this year.
The plan includes a new roof, sidewalks, elevator mechanical systems, energy-efficient windows and repairs to the mortarwork. In the category of esthetics, the building is getting new elevator cars, remodeled corridors on multitenant floors, improvements to newly leased spaces and renovations in its lobby and entrance, which include replacing the two revolving doors with one flanked by wider swing doors that comply with the access requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act.
The building's management has already added a hotel-style concierge station in the lobby and restored the soaring, gilt-trimmed bank office that is paneled in French cherry veneer. It is also refurbishing the restaurant at the base of the pyramid.
"The competition is so fierce, and there are so many options out there, that you have to be at your absolute best to attract new tenants," Mr. Wheeler said.
DESPITE the work to be done at 14 Wall Street, the building has advantages over other older structures. It has an ample power supply, and its ceilings are unusually high. It also has architectural distinction, easily seen in its airy and august lobby. And it has an owner with deep pockets as well as a steady income stream from tenants.
Not all owners are so well positioned, and the New York City Planning Department is coordinating a new study that will seek solutions for their problems.
One option is to convert older buildings to residential housing. Another often-mentioned solution is demolition for those buildings that cannot be used for other purposes, with the lots then left vacant for parks until the space is needed for a new building.
While even some preservationists agree that not all of the buildings can be saved, the practical side of demolition poses problems. It is expensive and difficult to take down a building in lower Manhattan's tight and winding streets. Also, the city's zoning laws, enacted after many downtown buildings were constructed, restrict the size of new buildings that could replace them.
Despite the gloom over the empty office space, the downtown area has history on its side in bouncing back from adversity. One notable comeback occurred in 1958, when warnings about its death led David Rockefeller to form the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association to examine the area's future. "Then he built Chase Manhattan Plaza, which was an immediate, very loud statement that downtown was indeed not dead," recalled Barbara L. Christen, president of the association.
Now the group is looking to the conclusions of the city study, expected in June.
"The theory is that every time lower Manhattan goes into the doldrums, there's a major development that pulls it out," said Mr. O'Keefe, the Edward S. Gordon downtown manager, as the bells of Trinity Church pealed the hour next door to his Broadway office.
"It's where this nation was founded, and it's where George Washington was first sworn in," he added, reeling off a list of downtown's attractions -- the South Street Seaport, the summertime opportunity to rent a sailboat, a winter breakfast at Fraunces Tavern and the fact that downtown is consistently cooler in the summer than midtown because it is surrounded by water. "It's just a nice place. And someone's going to figure that out again."
 
 
 
VISIONS OF 24-HOUR NEIGHBORHOODS
 How to avert the death of downtown Manhattan? That is the question the New York City Planning Department is trying to answer in conjunction with the city's Economic Development Corporation and the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association.
In their study of downtown's future, the groups are looking at the erosion of the area's employment base but are also examining potential new uses for old office buildings. One possibility is to convert some empty buildings to residential housing. The study estimates that about 45 buildings containing 4.2 million square feet of space are likely candidates for residential use.
Shirin Karanfiloglu, manager of the study, said about 110 buildings, most of them small structures in the southern Tribeca and South Street Seaport areas, have already been converted to residences. Only three buildings that are 15 stories or taller have been converted, she said.
Among the obstacles to conversion are the size and shape of the buildings, as well as zoning regulations. Further, the area is lacking in grocery stores, dry cleaners and other businesses that support neighborhood life.
"A major goal of our study is turning lower Manhattan into a 24-hour environment," Ms. Karanfiloglu said.
Another possibility for invigorating downtown is a plan to build a big new building to combine the American and New York Stock Exchanges. Early discussions have reportedly put a price tag of $1 billion on a 50-story tower including two 55,000-square-foot trading floors. The new building would clearly make some older structures even less competitive, but its supporters hope it would have a positive overall effect on the area's future.
Barbara L. Christen, president of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, predicted that a variety of solutions would ultimately be found: a mix of traditional office space, residential conversions and space for innovative uses ranging from educational centers to computer software design laboratories.
"And then, when nothing fits, that's when you may have to take a building down and make a park, then bank it until such time as you have the money and the need to build a new building," she said.

HEADLINE: Don't Joke About This Stock Market

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
In his private trading room at a local securities firm, Millions Yang peers intently at a parade of price charts flowing across a computer screen. Mr. Yang, a rotund former Red Guard who earned his nickname the easy way, by making millions in the stock market, breaks into a smile.
"Today I made 100,000 yuan," almost $20,000, he says, laughing. "Not bad for a day." 
 Outside Mr. Yang's office during one recent lunch break, several hundred small investors line up, eager to place orders when trading resumes two hours later. Millions Yang goes to the door and they ask him for advice.
"Millions Yang!" call dozens of voices. "Millions Yang, what should I buy?" one man shouts. "Give me some tips," yells another. Millions Yang -- which translates to Yang Baiwan in Chinese -- chats with those in front of the line. Heads crane as those in back try to overhear.
"I'm trapped in a loss," one woman tells him despairingly. "What should I do?"
"You must be willing to take a loss," he answers, and people nod, taking mental notes. "If it's going down, sell it and accept the loss. Otherwise you'll be stuck with a bigger loss."
That's the way it is at the Chinese stock market these days. The market used to be just a curiosity, a sort of masquerade in which Communists cross-dressed as capitalists and waved share certificates in place of little red books. American financiers and journalists dropped by the stock exchanges to chat patronizingly with the traders: "So, Mr. Yang, how much money did you make today? A dollar! That's wonderful -- you're going to be a rich man."
 
2 Million Shareholders
 No one is patronizing these days. Now China has two million shareholders, with the number growing by about 50,000 a week. The market index in Shanghai soared 167 percent last year, and these days even the small American investor can buy into the Chinese market, although some experts suggest it might be just as prudent to visit Las Vegas.
On a good day, the two-year-old Chinese market trades $350 million worth of shares, more than Hong Kong in a slow session. And it is growing at a prodigious rate: in the first quarter of 1993, the Shanghai Stock Exchange enjoyed a trading volume 2.2 times that of all of 1992. With the number of listings expected almost to double this year, some experts think that in a year or two the Shanghai market will regularly enjoy the highest volume in Asia outside Japan.
In short, the Chinese stock market is transforming itself from a curiosity to a major force. The metamorphosis is quite a spectacle. Thousands of Chinese companies yearn to go public, at home or on foreign exchanges. Hundreds of foreign accountants and lawyers are struggling to make sense of nonsensical Chinese balance sheets. Western investment banks are opening offices in China and paying huge sums for anyone who knows how to say "P/E ratio" in Chinese. Above all, tens of millions of ordinary Chinese are desperate to become shareholders. Last August, a million Chinese lined up for days under a fierce sun to buy stock -- more precisely, to pay several weeks' salary for an application form that would give them a 10 percent chance of being allowed to buy new shares. When the forms ran out, the would-be investors rioted. Securities executives in the West could be pardoned for feeling a bit envious.
The growth of the stock market is having an important effect on China as a whole. First, state-owned companies, perennially inefficient, begin to care about profitability. "You can see that when the companies issue stocks, they have to have a board of directors, they have to be audited, and they pay a lot more attention to efficiency," said Pan Muping, the Shanghai representative of Crosby Securities, a Hong Kong-based brokerage that was one of the first to be bullish on China.
More broadly, the rise of the market legitimizes the kind of quasi-capitalism that has been around for a dozen years but is steadily becoming less quasi and more capitalism.
Also, it helps create the kind of urban middle class that is the foundation for a modern civil society. In the past, the Communist Party was the sole source of power and prestige. While the party remains awesomely powerful, it is no longer the only show in town. Business interests are becoming an alternative power base, an alternative source of values, a rival source of prestige.
 
A Westerner Impressed
 The changes impress William A. Schreyer, chairman of Merrill Lynch & Company, who was in China last month to open the firm's new office here in Shanghai. "The modernization of China's economy, I think, is one of the most exciting endeavors in this century," he said, "and we want to be there and be part of it."
Mr. Schreyer said he was impressed from the moment he took the road from the Beijing airport and saw what seemed a continuous construction zone. He grew more enthusiastic when Prime Minister Li Peng and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin both received him and expressed interest in improving corporate accounting standards.
"If I were 25 years younger," the 65-year-old Mr. Schreyer said, "I'd study Chinese and ask Merrill Lynch to post me there."
He added that Merrill Lynch is positioning itself in China in the hope of growing with the local market just as it did in Japan 32 years ago.
What? Mention the Japanese and Chinese stock markets in the same breath? A couple of years ago that would have been regarded as foolish. Now it's regarded as visionary.
"China is the world's fastest-growing economy," said Duncan P. F. Mount, managing director of CEF Investment Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. "There are about 300,000 incorporated companies, of which about 70 are listed. In time, it's obviously going to be Asia's biggest stock market, probably bigger than Japan. The question is how long it's going to take, not is it going to happen."
 
Some Caveats
 To be sure, the same could have been said back in 1914, when Shanghai first opened a securities exchange. Fund managers and brokers who promoted Shanghai back then may eventually be proven to be visionaries, but from beneath their gravestones their clients will be unimpressed.
Even now, the Chinese market faces enormous challenges that Westerners do not always appreciate. Like the rest of the economy, the stock system is laced with corruption that alienates many ordinary citizens. Most of the trading is a speculative froth that bears little relationship to fundamentals, and some of the excitement seems to be of the flavor-of-the-month variety. At various times, other emerging markets -- South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Mexico, etc. -- have been the toast of international investors, but often the small investor showed up as the party ended, just in time to pay the bill.
What is more, most of the Chinese companies that list stocks are from the state-owned sector, which is the weakest part of the economy. The companies that are behind the Chinese boom are the small township factories and private enterprises that operate on a small scale, bribe local officials, dodge taxes and keep miserable accounts. It is virtually impossible for foreigners to buy shares in them.
This may well be the make-or-break year for the Chinese stock market, which is still formally dubbed an experiment. If all goes smoothly, China's leaders are expected to decide next year that the experiment is over, and that they can implement the shareholding system on a far wider scale.
The stock market in its current form began in December 1990 with the formal opening of the Shanghai Securities Exchange. About the same time, the southern city of Shenzhen, next to Hong Kong, was also allowed to open an exchange.
These days the Shanghai exchange trades in 62 stocks, with several more to be listed over the next month. The exchange now has 600 seats; in June that will rise to 2,500. The Government has agreed in principle that 50 or 60 more companies from all over the country can list this year, issuing shares with a par value of $1 billion.
"Late this year or early next year, we'll regularly have higher trading volumes than Hong Kong," said Wei Wenyuan, the executive director of the Shanghai exchange. "Then it'll keep going up from there."
The Shanghai exchange has gradually left the Shenzhen exchange behind and become the premier market in the country. A half-dozen other cities are desperately trying to start their own stock exchanges, but the Government has refused to allow them to do so.
Many Chinese buy stocks with the giddy excitement they might show in entering a casino. Investors have heard about a few people who committed suicide after losing their money, but mostly they hear stories about folks like Millions Yang. The losers keep quiet. So the emphasis is on speculative in-and-out trading. Chinese speak of "chao gu," or stir-frying stocks, meaning to turn them over quickly.
Chinese do not telephone their brokers; instead they swarm into the brokerages. Each of the dozens of brokerages in Shanghai has a huge trading room in which individual investors stand shoulder to shoulder, watching a huge screen with share prices. To trade, they fill out a form and stand in a long line, sometimes for hours, to give it to a broker.
In Shanghai alone, more than 100,000 people have become professional investors. Some have quit their jobs; others -- in what local people say with a wink is a demonstration of the superiority of socialism -- simply don't show up at work while still being paid. They spend every day in the trading rooms of a brokerage.
The "da hu" -- big rollers, those with more than $90,000 in their accounts -- get favored treatment. At Shenyin Securities, for example, a da hu is allowed to pay $40 a month and get a pass to enter a basement room with sofas and computer monitors. A purchase order can be handed to a broker without waiting in line.
"A year ago we had 15 da hu here," said Zhu Weidong, a 22-year-old broker who looks after them. "Now we have 60." Mr. Zhu said the richest of them once had the equivalent of almost $2 million in his account.
The securities boom has created a shortage of employees in the field. Companies lure brokers by paying $200 a month, several times the prevailing wage, and offering bonuses.
For now, of course, the stock markets are essentially local ones in just two of China's innumerable cities. But this year they are supposed to go national. The Shenzhen exchange just listed a company from Hainan Province, and one or two major companies from each of China's 30 provinces are supposed to go public in Shanghai or Shenzhen in the coming months.
At the same time, the Shanghai exchange is eagerly targeting investors in other cities. Fifty cities, in every province but Tibet, are now hooked up to the Shanghai stock computer system. On April 26, the exchange began to broadcast share information by satellite to a network of receiving stations all over the country, and two-way trading by satellite is scheduled to begin in November.
The transformation of the Shanghai market into a national one would be hugely important. It would multiply the pool of potential investors by a hundred, and allow more long-term investors to join the speculators.
 
Little Regulation
 Still, the market faces a host of problems. One of the most important is that there is little regulatory control. A new Securities Regulatory Commission has been established, but nobody seems inclined to pay it much heed.
"The foundation for China's stock market is seriously inadequate, creating equally serious problems," a confidential Government report declared recently. The 18-page report, classified secret, strongly supported the continued development of the market but warned of far-reaching corruption, inter-ministry rivalries and other problems. In particular, the report warned against "power shares" -- gifts of stock to Government figures to win favors.
"We're approached by companies every day, banging on our door and saying that they want to go public," said Gao Xiqing, an American-trained lawyer who is chief counsel to the Securities Regulatory Commission. "It's remarkable how the whole country is so gung ho." Perhaps too gung ho. Because the Government is restricting the numbers that can go public, there is a natural temptation to offer bribes.
"Some people come in and offer us X number of shares in their company," said Mr. Gao, who is in charge of public offerings. "They don't have the concept of a conflict of interest. I say I can't take it, and they think I don't have the money. So they say it's free. And then when they understand that I just can't accept it, they say it doesn't have to be in my name."
Millions Yang acknowledges that there are problems in the stock market, but he thinks they will be easily overcome. Shanghai, he says, will eventually become the financial capital of the Far East.
Asked whether hard-liners might close the stock market after Deng Xiaoping dies, Mr. Yang paused for only a second. "I don't worry," he said, then offered a novel interpretation of Marxism: "The goal of the revolution was to make people rich, and now they're rich. The Government won't allow folks to become poor again."
 
VARIOUS WAYS TO GET IN ON THE CHINA PLAY
 ASIDE from rushing to Shanghai and "stir-frying" shares alongside Millions Yang, foreigners can participate in the Chinese stock market in several ways.
One of the simplest is to buy into one of the 30-odd China funds, with $1.3 billion in assets, offered by international securities firms. Some of these funds are traded, like shares, on the New York Stock Exchange and other exchanges, or are available directly through brokers.
The problem with that is that some of the funds are not what their names might imply. Some hold mostly cash rather than China stocks, or their "China holdings" may be almost entirely companies in Hong Kong that do business in China. The recent fascination with "China concept" stocks has led many Hong Kong companies to put China in their names so that they can enjoy the premium afforded to China plays.
Another possibility is to invest in Chinese companies listed abroad. One such company, Brilliance China Automotive Holdings, was listed on the New York Stock Exchange last year, and others hope to follow. In addition, nine Chinese companies are expected to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange later this year. The best known is Qingdao Brewery, which makes Tsingtao Beer.
The final possibility is to invest directly in Chinese shares. While foreigners are not allowed to buy ordinary shares in Chinese companies, 10 companies in Shanghai and 9 in Shenzhen have listed a special kind of foreign currency-denominated stock -- called B-shares -- that only foreigners may purchase. Some large brokerages can arrange a purchase of the B-shares.
However, transaction costs in B-shares are relatively high, trading volume is low and the B-shares change hands at less than half the price of the A-shares held by Chinese investors.
One reason in the past for the limited demand was that the clearing system in Shanghai did not meet standards of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, effectively keeping out many American investors. But the Shanghai exchange has started a new settlement system, and last month the S.E.C. agreed to allow China funds to buy B-shares.
Buying by American fund managers may give the B-shares a boost, but they would get an even bigger boost if Chinese nationals were allowed to use their United States dollars to buy them. China's central bank and foreign exchange agency have so far blocked proposals to allow Chinese to buy B-shares.
 
 
 
RED GUARDS TO HOT PROFITS

BEFORE Millions Yang became an investment legend, he was active as a Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. Those were chaotic years in Shanghai. Vehicles were instructed to go forward at a red light and stop at a green light -- the Red Guards reasoning that red, as the revolutionary color, should not be associated with coming to a halt. Not all drivers got the message, however, and accidents were common. Finally traffic lights were given special dispensation to pursue their bourgeois ways. A red light again meant to stop.
After the Cultural Revolution, Mr. Yang, whose real name is Yang Huaiding, found that making money was more fun than making revolution. He entered the securities business in 1988, buying Government bonds in rural areas and selling them in Shanghai. This was a lucrative business, and partly as a result it was suspect. While there was no clear law against it, the authorities periodically denounced such arbitrage with the ugliest of words in the official vocabulary: speculation.
When the stock market opened, Mr. Yang began reading about equities, quickly developed a knack for trading and became the nation's most famous investor. In China, he says, it is still pretty easy to make a quick profit. "In New York, the market is more mature so it's harder to get a profit," he said. "Here everything is still being developed, so it's a lot easier."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Beating Some Unbeaten Paths

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
After spending three weeks in Brazil, Argentina and Morocco, J. Mark Mobius, the granddaddy of emerging markets investing, touched down in New York in mid-April to begin a two-week whirlwind city-a-day tour around the United States to visit clients. Then he left for Sri Lanka, all the while planning his summer trip to Russia, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
The agenda is typical for Mr. Mobius, who spends so much time in transit, circling the globe thrice a year, that he fills up passports in 12 months and donates all his frequent-flier miles to relatives. 
 His insistence on seeing his investments firsthand has paid off. He is one of only a handful of managers with emerging-markets experience, and "knowing the markets, and how they function, is imperative to delivering the returns," said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., mutual fund researchers in Chicago.
Among Mr. Mobius's $1.3 billion under management in the United States, Britain, Canada and Asia is the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, a closed-end fund set up in 1987 that returned 28.6 percent, on average, for the five years through April 30. Meanwhile, his mutual fund set up in November 1991 to invest in the same type of stocks, Templeton Developing Markets, gained 4.3 percent from inception through April 30, Morningstar said.
Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares that trade on exchanges, often at a discount or premium to the value of their holdings. Templeton Emerging Markets has been trading at a hefty premium of roughly 30 percent, which even Mr. Mobius concedes is high. He recommends investors opt instead for the mutual fund.
Both funds draw their 60 to 90 issues from the same list of what he considers cheap stocks in developing countries, he said. As to which fund owns what stocks, Mr. Mobius said, that depends on "accident and the market mechanism." Over time, the portfolios should begin to look the same, he said, because he holds stocks for five years or more.
By his definition, emerging markets include everything but North America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Europe (except Portugal, Greece and Turkey). These developed economies account for roughly 90 percent of global market capitalization.
Why his faith in emerging markets? Because 85 percent of the world's population and natural wealth reside there, compared to only 15 percent of the world's output.
"The story is hope and growth," Mr. Mobius said. "We don't subscribe to the Malthusian disaster scenario." The emerging markets, he said, are growing more rapidly than the developed markets because the populations are young, people are living longer and literacy is increasing.
Nonetheless, emerging markets investments are not for the faint of heart. Investors will be rewarded only "with patience, and there will be some burnt fingers," he said.
Mr. Mobius, a 56-year-old bachelor who has a home on Lantau Island, Hong Kong, and an apartment in Singapore, figures he spends 80 percent of his time traveling, digging up information that, he says, is simply not available otherwise. "It's easier to hold on to purchases going down in price if I see the plant and how people work and I know the management," he said.
In the markets of developing countries, where regulatory standards are loose, if they exist at all, intangibles count all the more. Thus Mr. Mobius might investigate the reputation of a family that controls a company he is interested in, which makes it "important to be on the ground."
And in many countries, inflation is so high that accounting policies require more time for interpretation.
The biggest factor pushing emerging-markets growth is privatization, said Mr. Mobius. He noted that when Argentina, for instance, began privatizing railways, water, sewer and electric systems, the budget deficit, which had been created by supporting the inefficient state enterprises, began to fall.
A long-time value investor, Mr. Mobius looks for "undervalued situations." He asks how a company will perform five years hence, based on shareholder earnings after taxes and charges. Then, too, a company must be cheap "relative to its own historical price levels, its own market and similar companies around the world." He sells shares only "when I can buy something 50 percent cheaper than what I already own." As for hedging currencies, "I don't, because over the long run, equities are a hedge."
So where does the Indiana Jones of international investing see bargains today? Right now, each fund is about 40 percent invested in the Phillipines, Brazil, Turkey and Malaysia (about 10 percent in each country), with 4 to 6 percent each in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Greece and Portugal. Profit-taking over the last year reduced the funds' holdings in Thailand, Hong Kong and Argentina.
In Eastern Europe, Mr. Mobius says he is "investing in Hungary, nibbling at Poland and looking carefully at the Czech Republic."
Among his current stock favorites are Ottoman Bank in Turkey; United Plantations, a British-listed orange grower in Swaziland; Cycle and Carriage, an automobile distributor in Singapore, and Philex Mining, a copper and gold miner in the Philippines.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The New Challenges for the C.I.A. Are Open Secrets

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BEHIND closed doors these days, Congress and the Clinton Administration are agonizing over openness. Their task is to figure what best to do with American spies in a less secret world.
The agony is in some part pleasure: the post-cold war reassessment represents a reward. But if an open world leaves less reason to worry about the Russians, it appears more prone to unpredictability. For intelligence agencies, it probably raises more questions than it solves. 
 Even in recent days, there have emerged fresh demands -- reminders that the black and white of old disguised countless shades of gray. From France, an ally: the disclosure of a document instructing agents to seek American corporate secrets, a discovery that has prompted the United States to boycott the Paris Air Show in June. From Pakistan, a fast-fading ally: new signs of missile shipments from China that have added to fears of the Pakistani nuclear threat.
And from the former Yugoslavia, once obscured by the East-West divide: an ethnic splintering so vicious that reaction to an American military intervention remains anyone's guess.
But the lawmakers and spymasters facing such pressures have also found themselves forced to confront fiscal reality. On Capitol Hill, where wrangling over a still-classified spy budget has already begun, Democrats have voiced deep misgivings about a request whose $28 billion size is one of Washington's most public secrets. That is even more than Congress allotted last year, and in its defense Mr. Clinton and his Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, have made plain that in the future spies will have to make do with much less.
Striking a new balance between those resources and tasks is shaping up as a wrenching conversion. One plan calls for a 17.5 percent cut in intelligence staffs by 1997. There is talk of building satellites that can eavesdrop and take pictures at the same time.
Even efforts to simplify carry short-term complications. A plan by the Central Intelligence Agency to merge records kept separate for security reasons has been a computer technician's nightmare. And while a Presidential directive disclosed last week will lead to the release of hundreds of thousands of classified documents, it has opened an internal Government debate about what should still be kept secret.
Exactly what will come of the rethinking remains hostage to dozens of official reviews. But soundings from Congressional and intelligence officials have given hints about the emerging shape of the country's post-cold war spying enterprise.
Most suggestions that it be disbanded appear to have been replaced by acceptance of intelligence as cost-effective insurance. Moreover, intelligence agencies are likely to be spared the deep cuts inflicted on the military.
One reason is that unlike armies, spying cannot easily be compressed into a rapid deployment force. To be effective, a spy must be in place long before a crisis breaks. The other reason has to do with a metaphor favored by Mr. Woolsey. He describes the new world as a jungle in which a dragon has been slain but there remain many deadly snakes, and even his critics accept that the job for spies is to judge which might strike next.
Openness has certainly made that task easier; Bosnia, for all its fearsome hatred, has become a relatively penetrable place. But a generally accepted list of current intelligence priorities is a reminder of just how closed the world remains.
At its top are still the nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union, still the stuff of secrets. Next in turn come North Korea and Iran, for their nuclear aspirations, support of terrorism and hostility to the West. Next are hair-trigger tensions between Pakistan and India, both becoming more deadly as nuclear powers.
For spies, the obstacles these countries now pose may be even more formidable than those presented by the cold war. North Korea is more closed than Moscow ever was; Pakistan has taken particular care to disguise its missile imports. To keep track of radical Islamic fundamentalism, the C.I.A. is beginning a major effort to teach employees Farsi and the Turkic languages of Central Asia.
Meanwhile, the targeting of American corporate secrets by French spies has renewed an appetite for the United States to respond in kind. Since prosperity is a measure of security, the debate is over how far spy agencies should go in pursuit of economic intelligence.
All signs are that the answer will be to stop short of industrial espionage, still an American taboo. Even if some allies have no qualms about stealing secrets for Government-backed industries, officials warn that the same approach would leave American spies favoring private companies. Officials say it is more likely that the United States will fend off the French and other advances with public protests.
But there is unmistakable new eagerness for missions not usually given much status in American spying. And the half-shrugs with which Government officials responded last week to the arrest of a State Department official for passing secrets to Greece hinted at new rules in which spying by allies has become a less-mortal sin. Just as the United States did its best to get advance tips about Soviet arms proposals, Government officials acknowledge that top priorities now include the positions that economic rivals intend to adopt in high-stakes trade negotiations.
 
Ecology and Rights
 The parallel shift in policymakers' attention to issues like the environment has also not escaped the spymasters' attention. The National Intelligence Council, responsible for issuing spy agencies' assessments about the world, has been expanded to include a 12th officer to oversee the environment, human rights and other so-called global affairs.
Almost no one pretends, however, that this is what spy agencies are best equipped to do. The impetus appears instead to come from an aspiration that intelligence be all-knowing -- and from a reluctance to admit that it cannot.
Asked where they might make do with less spying, officials sometimes point to Europe and Africa, no longer theaters of the cold war. But even that scale-back could leave them awkwardly telling the White House, "We don't know."
It may be years before choices made today are proven wise or foolish. But the greatest danger may be that intelligence will spread itself too thin. Perhaps most important is that officials stop thinking about what is possible, and start thinking about their needs.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Tearing Apart Of Yugoslavia: Place by Place, Family by Family

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: BELGRADE

 BODY:
WHETHER or not peace is restored to the former Yugoslavia any time soon, the trauma and psychological dislocation of its inhabitants is already so profound after two years of fighting that peacemaking could well take generations rather than months or years.
Nowhere has the disintegration of Yugoslavia been more lacerating than in the former nation's many mixed marriages -- unions that cut across ethnic lines that have now become the frontiers of war. 
 Take Gordana Momcilovic, a 22-year-old bank employee who persists in calling herself a Yugoslav. Her father is a Serb, her mother a Croat, and her home once illustrated the blossoming of the idea of a nation uniting the southern Slavs.
When war broke out between Serbia and Croatia in 1991, the family was living in Croatia. In August that year, Ms. Momcilovic recalls, her father, a Yugoslav Army pilot, announced that they would have to move to Serbia. "He asked my mother, in front of me, if she wanted to stay in Croatia or come with us," she says. "In the end, my mother came."
By that time the question was highly poignant. Ms. Momcilovic's 23-year-old brother was already dead. He had opted to join the Serbian side when the fighting started. Croatian troops killed him near Osijek. Her father's three brothers also died in the same region.
"I cannot hate the Croats for killing my brother and my uncles, because if I did, I would have to hate my mother," Ms. Momcilovic says. "I am unable to hate my mother. Often I ask myself what I am now. The only answer I find is that I am a Yugoslav and will always be a Yugoslav."
Ms. Momcilovic's anguish is widely shared. The best estimate is that close to 15 percent of marriages in the former Yugoslavia were mixed. Many have been torn asunder.
Everywhere people go through painful rites, large and small, of separation and rupture. Duska Anastasijevic, a 25-year-old Serbian student and translator, struggles still with the painful realization that Croatia and its beautiful Dalmatian coast are now another country.
 
'A Sense of Loss'
 "We are full of a sense of loss," she says. "To me the worst, the least acceptable, and I am talking now of my emotional life and not the killings, is the loss of Dalmatia. I can still feel the stones of Dubrovnik beneath my bare feet -- their coolness, their smoothness, their ancient undulations.
"I cannot imagine that I will not feel those stones again. But Dalmatia is now in another land where I suppose I must be hated."
Faced with such jarring realizations, people ask why. They recall the time when they lived together and often did not know or care whether their neighbor was a Serb, a Croat, a Muslim or a Montenegrin; and they wonder now how that time could be washed away in a tide of hatred.
Some see international plots aimed at carving up the Balkans, arguing that it suits major powers like Germany and the United States to deal with small, militarily feeble, economically dependent countries.
Many blame the politicians, men like President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who had been faithful Communist apparatchiks until it suited them to become nationalists in order to cling to power.
Others blame Yugoslavia's former Communist leader, Tito, for fostering the nation's great lie: that the savage civil war fought by Croats, Serbs and Muslims between 1941 and 1945 could be forgotten and buried without judgment.
When Tito's Communist clamp was lifted, an explosion fed by the simmering ethnic hatreds of the 1940's ensued. Gordon Babic, a businessman from Sarajevo with a Serbian father and Muslim mother, was caught in the middle. His family fled the Bosnian capital for Belgrade last year. "I used to believe the world was governed by the laws of Isaac Newton," he says, "but after a year of the Bosnian war I believe Satan pulls the strings. This is pure madness."
The madness is captured in the appalling proliferation of maps here. Mottled monsters, they chart the makeup of what was Yugoslavia by race, religion and nationality.
The maps are now sordid weapons of propaganda, pointed to in any argument over why some patch should belong to one ethnic group rather than another. But in better days, they demonstrated how intertwined, through marriage and movement, Serbs, Croats, Muslims and others had become.
"The ethnic map of prewar Bosnia, and indeed prewar Yugoslavia, was like a jaguar's skin," said Vuk Draskovic, the main Serbian political opponent of President Milosevic. "The peoples were inseparably mixed. No magician could make ethnic borders on such a jaguar's skin."
But all the armies have been trying. "Ethnic cleansing" -- the killing and forced shifting of people to create ethnically homogeneous areas -- has, in turn, become the most overused term in the land. Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the majority Albanian community in the Serbian province of Kosovo, says Albanians are suffering "a quiet process of ethnic cleansing." He says Serbian oppression is forcing Albanians to leave.
Serbs in Kosovo, meanwhile, say they are suffering "ethnic cleansing" by the Albanians, who have been boycotting Serbian businesses to further their drive for an independent state.
This exasperates John Erath, an American diplomat. "Ethnic cleansing is an expression that is losing its meaning," he said.
Meaning is generally elusive today in what was Yugoslavia. Two years of war have bequeathed emotional exhaustion. "I'm O.K. because I have to be O.K.," says a woman in Belgrade. "Otherwise I'll die. And I don't want to die."
Young people are emigrating, perhaps as many as 200,000 from Serbia alone over the past year. Those that remain are in limbo. "People are tired," says one young woman. "They have no emotional energy left. Couples tend to stay together and single people do not get together. There seems to be no point in coupling."
This emotional emptiness means that it is hard to draw any reaction from people, even against leaders who have taken the country to economic disaster and ruin.
Every evening the desolating images fill the television screens: mutilated bodies, charred corpses, tales of rape and castration. There is a peculiar savagery to the butchery in Bosnia, even by the standards of war, a savagery also evident in the 1941-45 period, when babies were shot.
Why such horror? "You have to understand the fratricidal element to the bestiality," says Zarka Kovac, a prominent psychologist. "These are people with scarcely any physical differences. The Muslims are Serbs or Croats converted during the Turkish occupation. So you mutilate the person you have killed in order not to recognize your brother. This war is Cain and Abel."
Already, it is a war that has remade the Balkan map. Referring to the shape of Yugoslavia, which resembled a bird, and to the current slithering tangle of borders, Bojan Jovanovic, a Belgrade University anthropologist, said: "The bird that was Yugoslavia died in the night and in its place came several lizards."


GRAPHIC: Through all the debate last week over whether to intervene to stop the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbian attacks against Muslims continued. The United Nations Security Council proclaimed Sarajevo and four other besieged areas of Bosnia -- Bihac, Zepa, Gorazde and Tuzla -- to be "safe areas" but approved no measures to enforce its order. (The council declared the besieged eastern town of Srebrenica to be a "United Nations protected area." on April 16). Allied forces watched, from planes overhead, and waited.
 
BIHAC: Serbian forces last week mounted an unsuccessful infantry assault on this western enclave, whose predominantly Muslim population is estimated at 267,000, including many refugees. The city's prewar population was only 71,000.
 
BANJA LUKA: Bosnia Serbs were blamed for bombs that last week destroyed two 16th century mosques in the city where ther are 35,000 to 80,000 non-Serbs. The population has swelled because local Serbian extremists have expelled thousands of Muslims and Croats from districts surrounding the city, the largest in the Serbian-controlled swath of Bosnia.
 
TUZLA: Fighting in the area last week centered on the towns of Brcko and Gradacac, key Serbian targets because they control important sections of the overland corridor between Serbia and Serbian-held areas in western Bosnia and Croatia. The 725,000 people in the city of Tuzla and surrounding districts are connected with central Bosnia, and the outside world, by a single dirt road over high mountains.
 
SARAJEVO: The multi-ethnic Bosnian capital, under siege by Serbian forces throughout the war, experienced a relatively quiet week, with reports of only sporadic shelling and sniper fire. It population is 380,000, down from 526,000 before the war because many residents have fled. About 1,500 United Nations troops are there to supervise aid distribution and the airport.
 
GORAZDE: the area has been under siege for more than a year, though there were few reports of fighting last week. Its prewar population of 37,000 has swelled to 70,000 because of refugees fleeing Serb offensives. The only link with the outside world is a mountain track to central Bosnia crossed only on foot or horseback.
 
ZEPA: Unconfirmed reports from the eastern enclave spoke of fierce Serbian attacks and penetrations of Muslim defense lines. The enclave's population is estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 people, more than three-fourth of them refugees and about 8,000 of them children.
 
SREBRENICA: Though open warfare has waned, Bosnian Serb militiamen maintain their chokehold on the United Nations-protected town. Officials have expressed concern that malnutrition and poor sanitation might lead to epidemics. There are about 49,000 people in the enclave, thousands of them refugees.
 
UNITED NATIONS FORCES: Their safety is a primary concern as the United States and it allies consider intervention. There are 9,000 troops throughout Bosnia, primarily involved in relief efforts. Their main headquarters is in Kiseljak, near Sarajevo. An additional 14,000 peacekeeping troops are deployed in United Nations-protected areas of Croatia. Their headquarters is in Zagreb.
 
OUTSIDE FORCES
 
NO-FLIGHT ENFORCEMENT: Nearly 100 aircraft are involved, from the United States, France, Britain, the Netherlands, Turkey and NATO. The planes, including AWACS radar surveillance aircraft, fly from a variety of bases in the region, primarily Italy. Twelve American warplanes assigned to the mission fly from the carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the Adriatic.
 
SANCTIONS ENFORCEMENT: Seven NATO warships patrol in two groups in the Adriatic, along with five ships from the Western European Union. The effort also includes increased customs inspections and patrols along the Danube River.
 
STANDING BY: The United States carrier Theodore Roosevelt, cruising in the Adriatic with 5 other American warships, has more than 50 warplanes that could be used in bombing raids. There are also 6,000 marines on board. Presumably, United States Air Force planes would be sent to bases in Italy would also participate in air strikes.
 
THE VICTIMS: The Bosnian Government says 135,000 people have been killed in Bosnia, in addition to the more than 25,000 deaths in earlier fighting in the Yugoslav war, primarily in Croatia. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that the war has created 4.4 million refugees, equal to the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1991.

Astronomers Rage Against the Light

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
For the past century astronomers have waged an unequal battle against the mounting glare of electric lighting across night skies -- a smog of light pollution that renders faint galaxies all but invisible.
Two of the latest threats to astronomy stem from America's faltering economy and a widespread fear of crime. 
 One potential victim is the mighty 200-inch telescope on Mount Palomar, Calif., which has led the world in observational astronomy since the late 1940's. In 1984, San Diego, some 40 miles away, acceded to astronomers' pleas and replaced its white street lights with low-pressure sodium lamps. Astronomers love the pure yellow light because it is easily filtered from their instruments. But San Diego residents believe it aids thieves (though there is no proof of this).
The San Diego City Council, hoping to revive its downtown, is moving to replace its lighting with a lamp that could seriously degrade deep-space observations from Palomar.
Meanwhile, a Georgia company, Space Marketing, has announced plans to put a one-mile-wide reflective panel into space some time in 1996. Ostensibly a platform for scientific instruments, this satellite, which would appear nearly as large as the full moon, would carry a commercial message or symbol visible from the ground.
"The time may not be distant," said one anguished astronomer, "when we'll have to move to the far side of the moon if astronomy is to survive."

This Blessed Plot, This Glitzy Mall, This England

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT

DATELINE: WEST THURROCK, England

 BODY:
IT rises like a pastel apparition from the surrounding English countryside, more than 1.35 million square feet of landscaped atriums, shops, fast-food restaurants, movie theaters, fountains and bubble elevators, all of it under a single roof topped by glass domes and surrounded by 9,000 parking places. The Lakeside Centre is metropolitan London's largest shopping mall, a two-year-old retailing fortress set among the rolling hills of far Essex, 17 miles east of central London. On its busiest weeks, it will draw as many as 350,000 shoppers and 175,000 automobiles, and cause traffic on the nearby London beltway to back up for miles in both directions.
More than three decades after the push toward the suburbs remade America's cities, and introduced the shopping mall as the permanent alternative to Main Street, the last 10 years have seen British retailers mount their own invasion of the shires and sleepy hamlets beyond London, Birmingham and other cities. 
 Developers were abetted by the aggressive philosophy of deregulation espoused by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose disciples loosened the viselike controls of local planning authorities in the name of competition and free commerce. Since the mid-1980's they have opened five regional malls similar to Lakeside and built more than 250 smaller retail clusters of outlet stores, mega-supermarkets and discount warehouses amid green hills and pastures once crossed only by hedgerows. According to one survey, the new suburban and exurban centers now claim more than 17 percent of the British retail market in 1991, a more than threefold increase in less than 10 years.
But with Britain's economic malaise blunting the zeal of property developers, a growing number of government planners, rural preservationists and even retailers have pressed their own counteroffensive to roll back what they describe as the Americanization of England's countryside.
"They suck the vitality out of the city at the same time they exacerbate the process of out-of-town sprawl," said Tony Burton, a senior planner for the Council for the Protection of Rural England, who believes that the projects have not only scarred the countryside, but also depreciated the urban areas as well. "This small island of Britain cannot be turned into America, because we don't have the space to waste which you do."
 
Cars and Fumes

 
 Responding to concerns that such sprawl was exacting a toll not only on the country's landscape, but its cultural and economic heritage as well, the environment and transportation departments have published new planning guidelines that focus the attention of developers and shoppers on Britain's aging town centers.
At the heart of the guidelines -- which the Government hopes to implement later this year -- is a determination to emphasize traditional retail patterns, many of which are served by public transportation, over new "out-of-town" development, which is far more dependent on the private automobile. The guidelines' sponsors argue that this plan will reduce both fuel consumption and harmful automobile emissions by 10 to 15 percent over the next 25 years. The policy will also reaffirm the country's commitment to long-standing land use and settlement patterns, which feature highly compact, densely settled urban centers surrounded by mostly open green belts, where both commercial and residential development has been cautiously restricted.
Lakeside's 380 stores have dealt a blow to the local High Streets -- the British equivalent of Main Street -- in nearby Basildon and Dagenham. Mr. Burton asserts that cookie-cutter malls, retail parks and discount warehouses are also eroding the singularity of Britain's landscape. "We are losing the sense of place and local character that we all cherish and believe has made the British countryside so special," he said.
Lakeside is a clone of a suburban American complex, with two McDonalds, Sam Goody and The Gap. Two theme restaurants, a mock riverboat called Old Orleans and a Chicago-style speakeasy named Capone's, overlook a lake that was once a gravel quarry.
 
Following Europe's Lead

 
 In recent years, even some retailers have questioned the rush to the suburbs, warning that by overdeveloping outside the cities, merchants and chain stores were robbing themselves of business in town. Ross L. Davies, a professor at Oxford's Templeton College and director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, said retailers, far from wanting the Government to proscribe such development, want it to urge local governments to measure more carefully the impact of a proposed development on existing retail patterns.
Europe, which flirted briefly with the idea of suburban retail development in the 1970's, decided to tighten its own planning regulations to concentrate on town centers. "That we are shifting back now too reflects thinking across the European Community, particularly in regard to automobiles," Mr. Davies said. "The overall feeling is that we've got to shift people to public transportation, and to achieve that we must reduce urban sprawl and emphasize existing routes."
This does not mean that the Government will bar large-scale outlying projects any time soon. Outside Manchester, developers say they intend to go forward with plans for a 300-acre complex on the city's outskirts, despite complaints from local governments that it will rob local towns of retail business and add to traffic congestion and pollution.
To the developers, the heart of the matter is satisfying consumer demands, not the abstract notions of planners. "Once people have gotten used to the idea of free parking, discounted prices, wide selection and climate-controlled shopping, the High Street just doesn't look the same anymore," said Brian Lucas, the manager of Lakeside.

HEADLINE: Clinton Reverses Policies at U.N. On Rights Issues

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Taking a more aggressive stance on international human rights issues than its Republican predecessors, the Clinton Administration is pressing for appointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, as well as a special envoy to investigate abuses against women.
The initiatives were part of a nine-page proposal presented this week to a human rights meeting in Geneva by J. Kenneth Blackwell, the head of the United States delegation. 
 "This is the new Administration's action plan," Mr. Blackwell said after presenting the plan in Geneva. "It builds on what the new Administration perceives as American traditions, values, and standards in regards to human rights and it also offers new ideas and a new assertiveness in other areas."
 
Rights Conference Planned
 The Geneva meeting was held to plan a major United Nations conference on Human Rights scheduled for June in Vienna. By the end of the meeting today it became clear that the Vienna conference would evolve into a showdown between Western nations seeking tougher human rights standards and developing nations, led by China, Iran and Pakistan, which oppose any new monitors of rights abuses.
Both Ronald Reagan and George Bush opposed the idea of a High Commissioner for Human Rights, who would coordinate the United Nations' human rights activities. The two Republican Presidents had argued that establishing such an office would add to the United Nations' bureaucracy.
The proposal put forward by the United States on Thursday would designate a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to oversee the implementation of decisions of all United Nations human rights bodies, assume responsibility for human rights issues related to peacekeeping and relief aid and have the authority to send special envoys to investigate allegations of human rights violations.
The commissioner would also have the power to bring to the attention of the Security Council allegations of gross human rights abuses.
The United States document also called on the United Nations to spend more money on human rights activities. The United Nations currently spends about $11 million annually -- about 1 percent of its total budget -- on human rights efforts.
Some American diplomats hope that the United Nations will increase spending in this area to about 5 percent of its total budget. These officials say they hope to reach that level by shifting funds that are already in the budget, not by asking governments to contribute more.
The document strongly emphasizes the rights of women. It recommends the appointment of a special envoy to investigate instances of violence against women, including "battering in the family, rape, female infanticide, honor killings and dowry murder."
But some women's groups criticized the United States proposal for failing to mention "reproductive rights," a phrase by which they usually mean women's access to family planning services, including abortion. Some also want the United States to support the idea that fear of persecution because of sex could be a basis for granting political asylum.
In March, the Clinton Administration also reversed previous United States policy when it supported a resolution expressing "deep concern" over human rights abuses in East Timor, the former Portuguese colony that was invaded by Indonesia and then annexed. Last year, a similar, though more strongly worded, resolution was blocked by the United States, Australia and Japan.
In another area of concern among human rights advocates and some members of Congress, Mr. Clinton has yet to say whether his Administration will seek to renew China's favorable trade status without conditions.
Christopher Patten, the Governor of Hong Kong, said after meetings with United States officials this week that he expected human rights conditions to be attached to the renewal of China's trade status.
State Department officials say the Administration will probably push for Congressional acceptance of four treaties that the United States signed under President Carter, but were never officially approved. The treaties are the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Inter-American Human Rights Declaration, and two accords that ban discrimination based on race and gender.
Officials of human rights groups say they are being taken more seriously by this Administration than by its Republican predecessors.
"There is clearly a signal that has been given at the highest levels of the Administration to get the word out that the nongovernmental human rights organizations are welcome back," said James O'Dea, director of the Washington office of Amnesty International.
"What I note now is that the access is higher and the meetings aren't pro forma," Mr. O'Dea said, comparing the Clinton Administration with the Reagan and Bush Administrations. "It isn't just window dressing."
Some critics note, however, that an emphasis on human rights was also a cornerstone of the foreign policy of Mr. Carter and that he was forced to turn a blind eye to abuses in some countries when not to have done so would have meant a clash with United States strategic interests.

HEADLINE: For Korean Immigrants, America Is Land of Golf

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Shouts of "Gong!" -- Korean for "Fore!" -- echoed across the damp, verdant fairways of the Great Gorge Country Club near McAfee, N.J., as clusters of grocers attacked the course from a half-dozen separate starting tees.
"It's called shotgun play," said Myong Y. Juch, president of the Korean-American Grocers Association of New York. "We can start and finish at the same time and save almost two hours." Although shotgun play is commonly used so all the players in a tournament can start at the same time, the technique seemed particularly fitting to these golfers, who approached the game with aggressive enthusiasm. 
 Thursday marked the group's third tournament, and intermittent rain was no obstacle to the practical, no-nonsense, time-is-money participants. The grocers relaxed with the same directed vigor with which most work 12- or 14-hour days running the stores that have altered the face of New York and other cities.
Little matter that many of the 105 players will never shatter 100, much less par. They scrutinized maps of each hole as if scouting a military operation, lined up their shots like the touring pros they had seen on television, then protested as physics exacted its often cruel course.
An exemplary effort, however, uniformly drew the following comment, "Nice shot."
 
An American Luxury
 Golf's attraction for Koreans lies partly in the fact that it was so out of reach in the old country. Participants recalled that country club memberships cost $50,000 in Seoul, when available at all. Greens fees commonly exceed $100 there, and caddies are mandatory at as much as $50 before tip.
"Some people came over here to play golf," said K. D. Hwang, who lives in New Jersey and owns a store in Manhattan.
In the New York area, some said, they play as often as once a week, sometimes beginning at 5 A.M. Many said they most often play with fellow grocers, discussing such business topics as prices, insurance and taxes.
The day of golf was supported by many of the food and beverage distributors who have come to realize the importance of Korean grocers in the city's economy. Marketing people from Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, R.J. Reynolds, Apple & Eve fruit juices and several milk companies were among those dropping by to give money for entry fees and convey goodwill.
Indeed, a 30-foot-high inflatable can of Bud Lite commanded a prominent position, while many grocers wore bright yellow raincoats touting Camel cigarettes.
"The Korean grocers are hugely important," declared Phil Birnbaum of Anheuser-Busch.
Of late, political talk has been markedly increasing. One topic is the recent verdict in the Rodney King case in Los Angeles. Just as Korean merchants there feared they might be the victims of rioters if the policemen accused of violating Mr. King's civil rights had been acquitted, New York's Korean grocers heaved sighs of relief. "Some people blame Korean grocers for everything," Mr. Juch said.
 
Political Issues
 The president characterized his members as an increasingly sophisticated group, no longer content to be "buttered up by politicians who tell us how hard we work and how smart our kids are."
He said that every mayoral candidate had met with the grocers' group and that soon each would be presented with a list of specific demands. The list, he said, will include reductions in commercial rent taxes, an easing of the issuance of sanitation tickets and a crackdown on illegal vendors.
In particular, he wants tax abatements on four buildings that the association is buying in Long Island City, Queens, to form a wholesalers' cooperative to sell to retail stores. The buildings are being purchased by the Korean Trade Development Corporation, a Korean Government agency, which in turn will rent the 100,000 square feet of space to the association. Korea hopes to use the co-op as a means to get more Korean exports into Korean groceries.
Mr. Juch emphasized that the heightened movement into politics of his membership as well as the more sophisticated approach to business planning represented by the co-op dramatize the growing sophistication of Koreans in the grocery business here. He said a survey indicated they average 42.5 years of age, have been in the United States for 7.5 years, have been in business 3 years and are considerably more affluent than their predecessors.
"Nowadays, they come with a bunch of money," he said, often through selling their home in Korea for $300,000 or more. "Ten or 15 years ago, you would hear stories of people starting out with $10 or $20, but no more."
Their business acumen is undeniable, say wholesalers and others. The grocers say few stores close, except for retirement or to move into a better location. Peter Spinella, Coca-Cola's director of special markets, agreed, saying, "They drive a hard bargain."
Some of the bargains have been to help improve often tattered relations with people in the poorer communities that many Korean grocers serve. On Tuesday at Hunter College they will join with Coca-Cola to present five black students with $2,000 scholarships. Anheuser-Busch gives $15,000 in scholarships to equal numbers of Korean and black students.
But golf took precedence on Thursday, as rain became sun. "This is comfortable," Sang M. Lee said. "Business is 24 hours sometimes, and this gives you time to yourself."
Mr. Lee's brother, Sang Hyun Lee, who works in the same store at 53d Street and Second Avenue, agreed that golf was his biggest relaxation, then proceeded to demonstrate why. He whacked a nine-iron shot high into the air, then watched it land four feet from the flag. "That's why people come back," he said with a tickled grin. "Just for the one great shot."
They might also come back for the awards. Anheuser-Busch presented 17 trophies, all waist-high and gleaming. Others were given 21 impressive golf bags. The person with the nearest shot to the hole on No. 6 won a round-trip plane ticket to Seoul. Everybody not yet awarded something was asked to raise his hand and presented with gift certificates for Korean food.
One of the trophies was won by Mr. Juch's wife, Chung, one of four women to participate. "If I hadn't invited her, she'd be working at the store today," an ebullient Mr. Juch said in presenting the award. "A lucky lady."

HEADLINE: Shifting List of Prospects To Be Justice

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
President Clinton is expected to announce an appointment to the Supreme Court within the next two or three weeks, White House officials said, although no one has emerged in the two-month search as a front runner.
Mr. Clinton is described by aides as preferring a woman, but several men have been on a list of candidates that has been growing and shrinking almost daily since Associate Justice Byron R. White announced in March that he would be retiring this summer when the Court term ends. Senate aides say it will take six weeks between a nomination and the beginning of hearings, and the White House wants confirmation proceedings to be completed in July, before the Senate leaves Aug. 9 for a monthlong recess. 
 Aides say that Mr. Clinton has eliminated many names while other officials have added others, and by all outward appearances he does not appear to have settled on even a short-list of candidates. The initial list was said to have included dozens of judges, law professors and politicians.
 
Closely Involved President
 Senior lawmakers in Congress say they have not been provided any names, and officials say the President has not spoken to any judge or other candidate about the job. His advisers say they do not know whether he will interview one or several candidates once the list is culled down, or simply select someone who is already familiar enough to him that a meeting would be unnecessary.
By most accounts, the President has played a more involved role in the selection process than any of his recent predecessors, and if there is a single reason why this search has taken significantly longer than previous Supreme Court searches, it is because it has largely been playing out in Mr. Clinton's head.
As a former state Attorney General and professor of constitutional law, he has long expressed a fascination with the Court, and his participation in the search has made it more demanding for the White House staff. He is described by some aides as regularly mulling over dossiers of candidates that include their opinions and writings and ordering his advisers to return with more names. He has also wavered over which constituencies the nomination should appeal to; in particular, the President has been concentrating on female, Hispanic and Jewish candidates.
He and his advisers have said they are looking for a progressive thinker who believes in a constitutional right to abortion and privacy as well as someone who would be able to forge coalitions. As their model, they have pointed to former Associate Justice William J. Brennan.
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, by contrast, selected six of the nine Justices now on the Court by taking the recommendations of their senior advisers and doing almost no selection work on their own. They would frequently name replacements within days of a Justice's announcement of his retirement.
Unlike his predecessors, who were in office for considerable periods before having to make an appointment, Mr. Clinton was in office for barely two months when Justice White announced his plans. Indeed, Mr. Clinton praised the Justice for giving him so long to conduct a search.
 
Starting From Scratch
 Last month, White House officials told some lawmakers that the President had begun the search from scratch after two leading contenders, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Judith Kaye, the chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals, removed themselves from consideration.
So far, the candidates under the most serious consideration for Justice White's seat have mostly been judges. Officials say that the list has included Shirley S. Abrahamson of the Wisconsin Supreme Court and five Federal appeals court judges: Richard S. Arnold of Little Rock, Ark.; Stephen G. Breyer of Boston; Ruth Bader Ginsburg of Washington; Mary M. Schroeder of Phoenix, and Stephanie K. Seymour of Tulsa, Okla. Another judge who has been mentioned is Jose A. Cabranes of Federal District Court in Connecticut.
Officials emphasized this week that many others whom they would not identify have also been under consideration and it was impossible even to point to possible front runners.
 
Constraints on Choices
 They said that Mr. Clinton had instructed aides to look beyond the courts for possible candidates and include lawmakers and state officials, although in searching for a politician, the White House faces some constraints.
Aides said Mr. Clinton might have been inclined to select a senator like his fellow alumnus from Yale Law School, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut; or the majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, who was a United States Attorney and a Federal district judge in Maine before he arrived in Washington, or Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, who graduated from Harvard Law School and practiced for seven years after clerking for a Federal appeals judge.
But the Democrats' slim majority in the Senate makes it politically unpalatable to do anything that would erode the party's control of Congress, particularly in light of the recent failure of the Administration's economic stimulus package in the Senate.
Mr. Clinton has not given serious consideration to elevating Attorney General Janet Reno to the Court, an aide said, largely because the Administration does not have the stomach to go through yet another search for a new leader of the Justice Department.
White House aides say the strongest influence over the decision will come from Hillary Rodham Clinton. In addition to her, the search for a new Justice is being conducted by the White House counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum; his deputy, Vince Foster, and Ronald Klain, an associate White House counsel who used to be a clerk to Justice White and a senior aide to Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat who heads the Senate Judiciary committee. Bruce Lindsey, director of personnel at the White House, has also been heavily involved.

HEADLINE: U.N. Weighs Plea to North Korea

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 8

 BODY:
The Security Council plans to take up a resolution in the coming week urging North Korea to open two suspected nuclear weapons sites to international inspectors.
The resolution was drafted by the United States and is supported by Britain, France and Russia. China, which has close though not always easy relations with North Korea, is expected to abstain but not to veto the measure. 
 North Korea insists that it has no nuclear weapons program and says it will not submit to regular inspections so long as American troops are stationed in South Korea.
 
Withdrawal From Treaty
 Rather than allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations agency, North Korea said in March that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as of June 12.
The proposed resolution calls on the Pyongyang Government to reconsider that decision. Western powers fear that North Korea's defection could prompt the departure of other countries that have signed the treaty but are suspected of running clandestine nuclear weapons programs.
Like the Western powers, China is concerned about Pyongyang's potential nuclear capabilities but has previously opposed Security Council initiatives to act on the issue. In the past, Washington has urged that economic sanctions be imposed against North Korea, but the proposed resolution makes no mention of them, diplomats said. Instead, it urges other countries to encourage Pyongyang to cooperate.
At the request of China, State Department officials have met with North Korean diplomats, and further meetings are planned. Some American officials have expressed concern that if Washington increases its reliance on Beijing to put pressure on North Korea, the Clinton Administration will have to ease its stand on China's human rights record and agree to expand trade.

HEADLINE: COMMENCEMENTS;
Carter, at Rice, Urges Help for the Less Fortunate in the World

 BODY:
Former President Jimmy Carter urged more than 1,000 graduates at Rice University in Houston yesterday to use their educational opportunities and their commitment to freedom to help less fortunate people around the world.
Mr. Carter devoted most of his commencement address to global conflicts. So-called ethnic cleansing, he said, is not unique to Bosnia, with racial and religious divisions now fueling more wars than at any other time in history. "Racial, religious, ethnic differences still cause tremendous suffering, deliberately perpetrated by one human being upon another," he said. 
 Mr. Carter, a Democrat from Georgia who was President from 1977 to 1981, told the graduating students that the Carter Center in Atlanta is now monitoring 112 global conflicts, including 32 major wars.
"This century, far beyond any other in history, has been burdened with tragedy, the unanticipated, deliberate murder of people by their own governments," he said.
With the end of the cold war, the United States as the sole superpower has become increasingly responsible for influencing the world, the former President said.
"We can't be the world's policeman -- that's not what I'm talking about," he continued. "But the economic and the political and the military and the cultural influences of the United States permeate the world."
He said it was too early to say how the United States would measure up to the challenge of using its expertise and resources to promote global peace, democracy and economic justice.
"The greatest discrimination in the earth today, including in our own country, is discrimination by the rich against the poor," Mr. Carter said.
After his speech he left for Paraguay to help oversee that country's Presidential election today. The former President has worked as an election observer in Haiti, Panama and several other countries.
Mr. Carter spoke at commencement exercises that were held under sunny skies at the university's academic quadrangle.
Rice awarded bachelors' degrees to 672 undergraduates and masters' degrees to 307 graduate students. The university does not confer honorary degrees.
 
Howard University
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, a former Democratic national chairman, was the main speaker at Howard University's commencement exercises yesterday on the university's main campus in Washington.
Mr. Brown told the 2,200 graduates that "we live in times of great challenge, hope and opportunity, times of transition and change," and urged them to "keep the drum beat of activism alive" and "to rouse those who have become too comfortable for the struggle and to reinvigorate those too tired to fight."
The university conferred 1,500 bachelors' degrees and 700 masters' degrees.
Mr. Brown was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree. Also receiving honorary degrees were Debbie Allen, the writer, choreographer and producer, and Dr. James P. Comer, a child psychiatrist at Yale University.
The late Reginald F. Lewis, former chairman and chief executive of TLC Beatrice International, was posthumously awarded an honorary degree.
 
James Madison University
 Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia delivered the main address yesterday at commencement exercises for 1,745 students at James Madison University. The university's 84th annual commencement was held on the campus in Harrisonburg, Va.
The speech by Mr. Wilder, the first black to be elected Governor, continues a recent tradition at James Madison: each of his two immediate predecessors, Charles S. Robb and Gerald L. Baliles, addressed the university's graduates while serving as Virginia's chief executive.
After Governor Wilder's address, graduates of the university's six colleges and its general-studies program attended smaller ceremonies where they received their diplomas.
 
Indiana University
 At ceremonies marking its 163d annual commencement, Indiana University began conferring undergraduate and graduate degrees on 14,776 students yesterday.
The ceremonies began with the presentation of 8,166 degrees in Memorial Stadium at the main campus in Bloomington. Degrees were presented to 6,116 undergraduate students and 1,984 graduate students.
Commencement ceremonies will continue at the university's eight campuses, beginning today and continuing through the week.
Robert Shaw, a former choral director at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, Mass., and a faculty member at the Julliard School of Music, delivered the main address. Mr. Shaw, the conductor laureate of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, received an honorary Doctor of Music degree.

HEADLINE: American Voices on Health Care: Even in Security, Anxiety

 BODY:
Interviews by Peter T. Kilborn with Americans in Iowa City and Cedar Rapids and across the Mississippi in Moline, Ill., disclose a growing diversity in health insurance coverage and care arrangements. Here are the stories of five families.

 
 
The Coens
Cradled, for Now, By Medicare
 Married for 57 years, William and Gertrude Coen talk about their health like a team, with more amusement than complaint. 
 "His liver enzymes went up," said Mrs. Coen, who is 76.
"Liver hepatitis, they called it," said Mr. Coen, 79.
"He lost about 35 pounds," she said.
"The enzymes are about normal now," he said.
"Gained 9 pounds," she said.
Only with prodding does the cost of Mr. Coen's treatment arise.
"He went to a doctor's office so they could take blood," Mrs. Coen said.
"Then we get a statement from Blue Cross saying how much they paid," Mr. Coen said.
The statement says, "Specimen transportation, $9."
"You got to pay the doctor to take the blood," Mrs. Coen said. "Now they even charge for carrying the blood."
For the Coens, health care is effective and gentle on their finances. Like 99 percent of the population 65 and older, they are covered by Medicare, the Government's health insurance program for the elderly, and they also have private insurance that covers most of what Medicare does not. "For us," Mr. Coen said, "it's O.K. the way it is. I know it's not for a lot of other people."
Mr. Coen worked for the post office for 37 years, the last 13 as Iowa City's postmaster. Mrs. Coen stopped work after their marriage to raise a daughter, now a professor of nursing at the University of Iowa.
They have paid off the mortgage on their compact split-level house in an Iowa City subdivision. They have a pension, Social Security and savings that give them an income of more than $40,000 a year.
Their sole significant out-of-pocket health expenses last year were $1,939 for medicine and $1,828 for insurance for hospitalization costs not covered by Medicare. This year they expect to pay much less for medicine because they have joined a program for Federal workers and retirees that pays 80 percent of the cost of prescriptions.
The Coens, however, wonder about long-term care, which can eat up $30,000 a year or more and is not covered by Medicare. Mr. Coen's mother died at 93 of Alzheimer's disease after seven years in a nursing home. She was indigent by then, having exhausted proceeds from the sale of her four-unit apartment house that was also her home.
But much as they think about long-term care, they said they are not worried enough to submit to the blandishments of salesmen who pitch them insurance to pay for it. It could cost them $1,000 or more a month, and they say the policies are riddled with exclusions. "When you need it most," Mrs. Coen said, "it doesn't do you any good."
Many retirees want the Government to help pay for long-term care, but the Coens say they just have not given much thought to that. "As long as we're able to pay, we should pay," Mrs. Coen said. But rather than hold onto their assets only to lose them all to a nursing home, they have been thinking about giving some to their grandchildren. They would slide into poverty that much sooner, when Medicaid would pay.

 
 
The Weirathers
Part-Time Work, Full-Time Worry

One Tuesday night, Maria Weirather and her spirited little girls arrive 40 minutes early for an 8:30 appointment at the Iowa City Free Medical Clinic. The bus they take from their trailer park passes once an hour, and the next would have made them late. The children, Beverly, who is 4, and Andrea, 3, need physical examinations and immunizations, and here, there is no charge.
Ms. Weirather uses the clinic even though she works. Twenty-five years old and divorced, she transcribes researchers' notes in the psychology laboratory at the University of Iowa and cleans the cages of mice, cats and chimpanzees. The job is only 20 to 30 hours a week and ends in late May, when she hopes to get another. She earns $5.50 an hour.
Health insurance does not come with the job, and Ms. Weirather (pronounced WY-rather) cannot afford to buy it herself. She collects $260 a month in child support from her former husband, Mark Weirather, and her grandmother pays for her telephone. But with expenses like the $360-a-month rent for her trailer, she still qualifies for $247 a month in food stamps -- "something I'm not very proud of," she said.
Ms. Weirather is 5 feet tall, a compact and vigorous, thoroughly engaged mother who boasts of the strength she has gained from chasing after buses and her kids. She finished high school at 17, married at 20, dropped out of college and had her two children.
She is among 56 percent of the 37 million uninsured Americans under 65 who have jobs, according to the Employment Benefit Research Institute in Washington. And Beverly and Andrea are among another 26 percent of the uninsured who are children. Typically, the wages of working people who lack insurance, however low, are not low enough to allow them access to Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for the poor.
Free clinics are often their principal recourse. The Iowa City clinic's mostly volunteer doctors, nurses and students provide outpatient services only, mostly shots, physicals, treatment of minor illnesses, some lab tests and prescriptions. It refers more serious cases to specialists, some of whom take the patients for free, more of whom charge a fee at the door or request monthly payments.
Ms. Weirather believes she can find a job that would provide health insurance if she can get her bachelor's degree in microbiology, and by taking occasional courses, she has just one semester to go. But she is trapped in trying to work and arrange child care with friends, so making time for college and saving to pay for it seem beyond her grasp.
Once Ms. Weirather's care was simple and automatic. Her former husband had insurance through his job as a mechanic at a Chrysler dealership when, in October 1990, a malignant tumor was found on her left ovary. "I went in, and they said, 'Surgery,' " she said. "Within a week, I had surgery."
After the divorce, Mr. Weirather left his job for another without insurance in Keokuk, Iowa, a two-hour drive southeast of Iowa City. Her eyes welling up, Ms. Weirather said that a year after her operation, doctors spotted another growth on the same ovary. They removed it last October.
Public assistance paid for the operation and her chemotherapy, she said. "But I was left owing $5,000 to the hospital," she said. That is why Ms. Weirather takes the bus.
"I had a 1990 Dodge Spirit turbo," she said. "It was essential transportation." She sold it for $4,000 to pay the bill. "It was the one really nice thing that I had," she said, "and the only new car that I ever owned."
 
The McLaughlins
Getting the Most From a Union Plan

Amber McLaughlin is an 8-year-old second grader in East Moline, Ill., who has freckles and plays baseball. She has brown eyes and pretty pink frames for glasses with lenses as thick as her thumbs. She called home from school one day this month upset that everything looked blurred again. Her mother, Valerie McLaughlin, promised her yet another pair of glasses.
Whatever Mrs. McLaughlin's anxiety about Amber's vision, the cost of her glasses has never intruded. Nor has the cost of visiting doctors, or the $16,197 for her four eye operations, or even the psychotherapy that Amber, her sister Carrie, 11, and Mrs. McLaughlin have sought to cope with the trauma. The family's sole expense is the $2 it pays for each prescription.
Amber is the beneficiary of her father's employment at Deere & Company, the maker of tractors and agricultural implements, and of the health care arrangements that the company has worked out with the United Automobile Workers. Deere offers unionized workers the choice of three programs, all without deductions from their pay. In the oldest plan, the company pays 100 percent of hospital and surgical charges but only $2 for a visit to a doctor's office.
The newest option, established this year, ties all care to a company medical center in Moline, which the Mayo Clinic of Rochester, Minn., helps run. The clinic provides services the old plan does not, like free physical examinations. But workers must choose one of the center's five family doctors, who are Deere employees, and rely on them for referrals to affiliated specialists and a local hospital or to the Mayo Clinic. They may bypass the center provided they pay 20 percent of the fees, or up to $2,000 for a family per year.
The most popular option and the one the McLaughlins use is the third: a health maintenance organization that Deere established 15 years ago, which has evolved into one of the nation's most comprehensive. Except for the tie to the Mayo Clinic and the convenience of the new center's one-stop service, the H.M.O. provides all the cost-free coverage the center does.
Most doctors around Moline, including more than 50 family doctors, have agreed to negotiated fees to participate in the H.M.O. Workers are free to see whomever they like within the organization. Only when they want to see nonparticipating specialists must they obtain referrals, which any H.M.O. doctor can provide, and the McLaughlins prefer the less restrictive access to specialists.
Mr. McLaughlin, 40, earns $40,000 a year. Mrs. McLaughlin, also 40, gave up a convenience store job six years ago soon after noticing a reddening of Amber's left eye and a swelling of her left knee. Their H.M.O. doctor, a family practitioner, said she had pink eye. And after X-raying the knee, Mrs. McLaughlin said, "he told us: 'I see a little fluid on the knee. We'll keep an eye on it.' "
The problems persisted, she said, so the doctor tried one form of medication and then another. Then, when he was away, she consulted another H.M.O. family doctor, who prescribed the original medication. "That meant to me that he hadn't looked in her file," Mrs. McLaughlin said.
The next day, she brought Amber to an ophthalmologist in the H.M.O. "This doctor told me she had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis," Mrs. McLaughlin said. Mr. McLaughlin added, "He said: 'She is going to be blind. Just accept it.' "
The McLaughlins then learned of a children's ophthalmologist, also in the H.M.O. He removed a cataract and then referred her to the University of Iowa, 70 miles away in Iowa City, for surgery for two more cataracts, a detached retina and glaucoma. The H.M.O. paid the full cost of her care there.
The McLaughlins say they have been told Amber has a 50-50 chance to retain her vision in at least one eye. They will never know if earlier treatment might have raised the odds. But they do know they want the freedom to choose special care the instant their instincts tell them they should.
 
The O'Connors
Taking a Pay Cut To Get Coverage
 The youngest of Debra O'Connor's three boys, 4-year-old Kyle, had a bad cough the night of Wednesday, Jan. 20. The 20 miles of road from her home in Lisbon, Iowa, to Cedar Rapids were icy, so she planned to wait until the morning to decide whether to take him to a hospital. "But it got really, really bad," she said, "so at 2 A.M. I took him in."
Emergency room doctors at St. Luke's Hospital diagnosed croup and viral infection. He spent four days there. Ms. O'Connor showed the hospital's statement from her files: $1,814.19. But her entire cost was $100. "I don't even fill out any medical insurance forms," she said. "For me it's very simple."
Ms. O'Connor, 30, and her boys live with her parents in an old farm house in Lisbon. She used to manage a pizza parlor where she earned about $22,000 a year. The employer provided her health insurance at no cost. But a family plan covering her sons would have cost $250 a month. "There was no possibility I could afford to do that," she said.
Her mother and her sister had a much cheaper, more comprehensive plan at the aircraft electronics factory in Coralville, Iowa, that is a part of Rockwell International. Rockwell has a preferred provider organization, which negotiates special rates for its employees. So in September 1991, Ms. O'Connor took an assembly job there.
She started at $6 an hour, or about $12,000 a year. With wage increases won through her union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, she now earns $8.20 an hour, still much less than before. "But I got full insurance benefits for $7 a month," she said. "That was a big deal for me."
Any day now, Ms. O'Connor expects to be making new demands on the health plan. Her oldest son, Adam, 9, rarely needs doctors, but the third, 7-year-old Zachary, has asthma, and a simple bee sting, she said, means a trip to the hospital. "It always triggers an asthma attack," she said.
She has to drive to a pharmacy in Cedar Rapids to have prescriptions filled, but the cost is $3 for generic drugs and $10 for brand-name drugs. Besides the $100 for a stay in the hospital, she pays $25 for outpatient service at the hospital and $10 to see doctors who participate in the preferred provider organization. And so many belong, she said, "it would be pretty hard to find a doctor you would not be happy with."
Still, Ms. O'Connor is skittish. The rise in health care costs is nipping at her insurance plan. Until this year, she said, prescriptions were free. And she cannot be sure of what lies ahead for Rockwell. The plant in Coralville has never laid anyone off, she said. But with the aerospace industry in turmoil, it could any day, and she would again be uninsured.
"You can bet there's fear," she said. She wants the Government to provide health coverage for all, the employed and unemployed. "I'm all for nationalized health care," she said. "If my taxes go up, they go up."
 
The Pattens
A Life of Work But Little Security
 "We mall walk," said Leo Patten, who is 61 and involuntarily retired. Weekday mornings, from 7:30 to 9, Mr. Patten and his wife, Elma, 58, also involuntarily retired, drive to the Westdale Mall near their home in Cedar Rapids and hike three miles, or six laps around the interior.
The Pattens belong to an association of 3,800 Cedar Rapids mall walkers. St. Luke's Hospital there has awarded Mr. Patten two T-shirts for having twice passed the 1,000-mile mark over his seven years of walking. "I'm trying to stay off the oxygen bottle," he said. Mrs. Patten, who started last year, is up to 150 miles.
Other than eating and sleeping right, mall walking is their only cheap answer to preserving what they have of their health, the Pattens say. The health care debate in Washington blows right by them, they say. "The things I'm hearing, it seems we fall in the cracks," Mrs. Patten said. "We're not employed, and we're not destitute." After decades of middle class security, the Pattens fear that another setback will drive them out of their $65,000 white clapboard home and onto the welfare rolls.
The Pattens grew up in Cedar Rapids. For 13 years in the 1950's and 60's they lived near Los Angeles where Mr. Patten worked as a machinist. Concerned that the area's drug problem would reach their four daughters, they returned to Cedar Rapids.
There, Mr. Patten found a machining job with a company that later folded. He moved to another but never worked anywhere long enough to qualify for a pension. Mrs. Patten became a marker at a department store, putting price tags on goods. It folded after she had been there 14 years, and it turned out that the store had spent what was to have been her pension. She then took a similar job at a women's clothing store.
In 1972, Mr. Patten was found to have the first signs of emphysema, and as his lungs deteriorated, he quit work in 1986. "Too many cigarettes and dirty machine shops," he said. "I've got 40 percent lung capacity. My goal is to hold it steady." Although not yet 65, he receives Medicare because he has been disabled for more than two years.
But because of his emphysema, he cannot get supplemental insurance to cover costs that Medicare does not like prescription drugs, prolonged hospital stays and treatment that exceeds the amounts the Government reimburses. "Insurance companies won't talk to him," Mrs. Patten said. "It makes me mad. He takes care of himself."
Nor will they talk to Mrs. Patten. On both wrists, she has the scars of incisions seven years ago to repair nerve damage from the repetitive motions of marking goods. She learned she had diabetes 15 years ago. She had a hysterectomy 13 years ago, double bypass heart surgery three years ago and a mastectomy last July, when doctors told her to stop work.
The department store's insurance covered her care while she worked there, and a Government-subsidized policy covered her for 18 months after it closed. But the clothing store's insurer denied her coverage because of her health history.
In July 1994 Mrs. Patten, too, will reach the two-year threshhold to qualify for Medicare because of her disability. But until then, the only coverage she can find is a plan the State of Iowa offers high-risk people. It would cost $255 a month and would start paying her bills each year only after she had put out $2,000, so her total cost would be $5,060.
Such sums are beyond the Pattens' means. Their savings are down to $2,000. Their income, about $23,500 a year, comes from $1,374 a month in Social Security, disability benefits and $581 a month in disability compensation from Mr. Patten's last employer. That check stops when he turns 65.
"A person keeps their nose to the grindstone, works hard, pays their bills on time," Mrs. Patten said in a letter to Hillary Rodham Clinton. "Then when your health goes bad they kick you into a corner."

HEADLINE: Washington Is Star-Struck As Hollywood Gets Serious

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment when things began spinning out of control on the celebrity front.
Was it when Michael Douglas eclipsed President Clinton at last weekend's White House Correspondents' Association dinner? 
 Was it when George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, began dating Jennifer Grey, the actress who starred in the 1987 movie "Dirty Dancing?"
Maybe it was simply when Barbra Streisand became as familiar a figure on the political scene as John McLaughlin, the carnivorous talk-show host.
 
A Rush From the Coast
 The Clinton White House is extravagantly star-struck, and Hollywood's liberal luminaries, sensing an opportunity to be taken seriously and savoring the compatible politics, are flocking to Washington. Hollywood moguls and stars are pushing to move beyond their traditional roles as campaign ornaments and cash machines and become more substantive players as communications, image and policy advisers, and as salesmen for Clinton Administration programs.
Cabinet members and White House officials are giving the Hollywood big shots policy briefings and asking their help in selling programs on health care, the environment and national service.
"The idea that these insulated and bubble-headed people should help make policy is ridiculous," said Leon Wieseltier, the cultural editor of The New Republic magazine. "Hollywood actors are even more out of touch than elected politicians. In Hollywood, politics is another way of dressing and talking."
But Mr. Wieseltier appreciates the similar qualities that link the worlds of politics and movies. "They're highly scripted, poorly directed and always over budget," he said.
Washington and Hollywood have always been drawn to each other because of their common interest in performance and image, and their complementary insecurities: the Hollywood elite wants to be seen as serious, and the Washington elite wants to be seen as glamorous.
But with the technological and talk-show revolution of the last Presidential campaign, politics has taken on even more of the techniques of popular culture and packaged entertainment. The Clinton convention and inauguration were painstakingly produced by Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, the Hollywood sitcom czars who have also bought a beach-front estate outside Santa Barbara, Calif., that the Clintons, their longtime friends, can use as a Western retreat.
Ronald and Nancy Reagan entertained old friends from Hollywood in the White House, veteran stars like Charlton Heston and Jimmy Stewart. With George Bush, there were only rare glimpses of glitter: drop-bys by Bo Derek and Michael Jackson and the pumping-up appearances of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 
A Hot Script
 But now there is a Democratic President whose nickname is Elvis and who likes Hollywood, a town that was slow to warm to him as a candidate but now seems to be in a stampede.
As Peter Guber, the chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, put it: "The herding mentality is so strong here that when a script is hot, everyone goes after it, whether they've read it or not."
Having become more sophisticated politically, many in Hollywood's royalty now want the same sort of access that other valuable constituencies like Wall Street have long enjoyed.
"Celebrities don't want to just be called to write checks," said Margery Tabankin, the executive director of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee and the head of the Barbra Streisand Foundation, a charitable organization. "Nobody in Hollywood comes to the table thinking that they have the answers on Bosnia. Come on! But they do come as artists, pained by human suffering, who want to bring their creative skills to the process."
 
Hollywood Commitments
 She said Hollywood types were helping to develop marketing themes for Administration programs and were committed to make personal appearances and public-service announcements.
A couple of Clinton strategists, detecting some negative sentiment about Mr. Clinton's celebrity connections showing up in polls, have warned that the President and his bedazzled young aides should cool their romance with Hollywood because it gives a liberal and elitist cast to a White House that wants to appear centrist and populist.
Even some on the West Coast privately worry that Mr. Clinton might be too taken with what one calls "the siren song that is so alluring to politicians."
"Frankly," said this powerful member of the Hollywood set who is close to the Clintons, "he'd be very wise to keep us at arm's length."
Politicians have been hurt in the past by being too closely identified with the city confected of dreams and desire: John F. Kennedy was drawn to that world, hanging around with movie stars and visiting Frank Sinatra in Las Vegas, Nev. The friendship of Gary Hart and Warren Beatty became emblematic of the sometimes dangerous liaison between these worlds, one Puritan, the other sybaritic.
 
Loss of Temper
 At least one Clinton strategist was openly contemptuous of the idea of catering to Hollywood. When the White House invited a group of Hollywood people to a health-care briefing, James Carville, one of the briefers, lost his Southern-fried temper and lectured them in a profane manner that made it clear that he did not believe that their affluent lives had equipped them to devise a plan to sell health care to average, struggling Americans.
Gary David Goldberg, the producer and director of such television series as "Family Ties" and "Brooklyn Bridge," stormed out and later told The Los Angeles Times that Mr. Carville had acted like "Anthony Perkins playing Fidel Castro on acid."
Mr. Carville seems relatively unrepentant, saying only: "Do I use bad words from time to time? Yes. They started telling me how many degrees they had. Somebody blurted out, 'I have a Ph.D. in communications from U.C.L.A.' Well, wowee-kazowee!"
But every day there is a bit more tinsel draped on the White House. On Thursday, Hillary Rodham Clinton sat for a photographic session with Kenny Rogers, the country singer who photographs stars on the side.
 
White House Mail
 David Geffen, the producer and record-industry executive, and Michael Medavoy, the chairman of Tri star Pictures, telephone Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, to jawbone about the economy, and Mr. Geffen is looking for an apartment in Washington. Judy Collins, the singer, the Thomasons and the Medavoys have all spent the night in the Lincoln Bedroom, and Liza Minelli is invited to stay over next month. (Sending a letter to a fellow movie mogul on the stationery kept in the residence is now the ultimate bit of Hollywood one-upmanship.)
Last month, a Hollywood group, including Billy Crystal, Christopher Reeve, John Ritter, Sam Waterston and Lindsay Wagner, checked out the Oval Office and White House mess, met the President and Vice President and got environmental briefings from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt; Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, and Katie McGinty, the White House director of environmental policy.
Markie Post, a cast member of the Thomason-produced series "Hearts Afire," and Ivan Reitman, the director of "Dave," have dropped by to watch the President deliver his Saturday radio address.
 
Ambitious Schedule
 On a clear day in Washington, you can see Barbra Streisand forever. In the last few weeks, she has popped up as a guest at the annual Gridiron dinner, slept over in the Queen's Bedroom in the White House and attended the health-care briefing.
Her schedule this past week was as ambitious as Senator Bob Dole's. A week ago, she went to the White House Correspondents' Dinner as a guest of Newsweek and chatted with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about Bosnia and homosexuals in the military. On Monday night, as Federal Bureau of Investigation agents stood guard, she hashed over issues with Attorney General Janet Reno during dinner at Citronelle, a modish Georgetown restaurant. On Tuesday, she met with female House members by day and went to a Democratic fund-raising event by night. On Wednesday afternoon, she made phone calls from the study off the Oval Office and then dined at a Georgetown home with Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and a trio of eligible Senators, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and William S. Cohen of Maine.
Consider the scene on Thursday night, at a dinner party for the newly confirmed Ambassador to France, Pamela Harriman, at the Georgetown home of Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of the Washington Post Company.
 
From Bosnia to Camcorders
 Barry Diller, the former chairman of Paramount Pictures and Fox Inc. who now owns part of QVC, a television shopping channel, joined some politicians and journalists on Mrs. Graham's terrace who were discussing whether Bosnia could turn into a Vietnam.
Mr. Diller listened for a while and then changed the subject to show business. "QVC is wonderful," he said. "The other night we sold 3,000 camcorders for $800 apiece."
After meeting with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia last month in Vancouver, British Columbia, Mr. Clinton had a late party in his suite with a bunch of Hollywood celebrities, including Sharon Stone, Richard Dreyfuss and Richard Gere.
Mr. Gere took the opportunity to lobby the President about meeting with the Dalai Lama, a conversation Mr. Clinton tried to sidestep by telling the actor that his China policy was not yet set.
"Hollywood people have realized that they don't have to be window dressing, that on particular issues they care deeply about, they can exercise their right to influence policy direction, whether it be the White House, the state house or city hall," said Donna Bojarsky, an adviser to Mr. Dreyfuss on public policy. (It is chic in Hollywood for celebrities to have their own political consultants.)
 
Model's Compliment
 At the invitation of Time, Ms. Bojarsky and Mr. Dreyfuss flew in for the White House Correspondents' Dinner and a glittering post-dinner party put on by Vanity Fair.
Vendela, the Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, quickly deserted a conversation with Michael Douglas when she caught sight of George Stephanopoulos. "You're so cute; I've seen you on television," the Swedish model cooed at the spokesman, who was speechless with appreciation.
Nearby, Ms. Streisand was analyzing news coverage of the President's first 100 days with Dee Dee Myers, the Clinton press secretary. And in another dark corner, Mr. Douglas, a guest of Howard Fineman, the Newsweek political correspondent, was deep in conversation about Bosnia with the Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine K. Albright.
Mr. Douglas was the most coveted celebrity that evening, even outshining the President who had an off night with a speech that was not very funny and contained a couple of gaffes. The actor wanted to talk issues, shrugging off inquiries about his steamy love scenes with Sharon Stone in "Basic Instinct" with the comment: "Another day, another dollar."
 
Fans Make No Apologies
 Two people in the White House, at least, are not making any bones about being huge fans.
Mark D. Gearan, the deputy chief of staff, keeps a video camera in his desk so he can ask stars to film messages to his 1-year-old daughter, Madeleine. "I feel like a bad reporter for Variety lurking in the West Wing with my camcorder waiting to catch celebrities," he said.
And then there is the President, who with the First Lady recently took Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward to dinner at Galileo, a Washington restaurant.
"He grew up watching movies like 'The Hustler,' 'Hud' and 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' and he still gets genuinely blown away by spending time with some of these people," Dee Dee Myers said. "There's still a lot of the kid from Hope, Ark., in him."

HEADLINE: First Free Elections to Be Held Today in Paraguay

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASUNCION, Paraguay, May 8

 BODY:
For the first time since Paraguay won independence from Spain in 1811, no one here knows who will win the presidential election.
Breaking a long tradition of military coups and rigged civilian elections, Paraguayans are to vote on Sunday in the first free presidential elections in their history. With three centrist candidates in a dead heat, the winner is to be chosen by the voters, a new concept in this landlocked nation in the heart of South America. 
 In another novelty here, all six presidential candidates are civilians after nearly four decades of rule by army generals.
If fraud does not taint the process, Sunday's vote could also break a monopoly of nearly half a century by the ruling Colorado Party, which was born in 1947. The Colorado's unbroken tenure is surpassed in the Americas only by Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party.
But, worried that fraud could affect South America's last conversion to democratic civilian rule, 300 international observers from eight different groups have come here to watch Sunday's voting.
 
Carter Leads Delegation
 Today, former President Jimmy Carter arrived, leading a delegation from the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a Washington group affiliated with the Democratic party that works to promote democracy.
"This is the first of four democratic elections this year in the hemisphere, and we want this one to work," one American Embassy official said here.
Elections are scheduled in Bolivia next month and in Chile and Venezuela in December. "Just like Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, Paraguay has never known democracy since it became independent in 1811," the official said.
On the economic front, the candidates share virtually identical, free-market platforms, calling for privatization of state companies and for more foreign investment.
Juan Carlos Wasmosy, the ruling party candidate, is Paraguay's leading cotton exporter. Guillermo Caballero Vargas, the main challenger, is Paraguay's second leading cotton exporter. Senator Domingo Laino, the Liberal Party candidate, is an economist by training and a politician by profession.
But the challenge posed by strong opposition candidacies poses a great test of the stated willingness of Paraguay's rulers to play by new democratic rules.
 
Threats From Military
 "Our decision is to co-govern with the glorious and immortal Colorado Party for centuries to come," bellowed Lino Oviedo, an army general second in military power only to President Andres Rodriguez, last week.
General Oviedo, a declared backer of Mr. Wasmosy, added that Paraguay's military would continue to rule with the Colorados "no matter whom it bothers, no matter whom it hurts, no matter whom it pinches, no matter who whines."
These threats, repeated several times during the campaign's final days, are widely interpreted here as an attempt to intimidate wavering Colorado Party members to back their candidates. Rather than threatening a coup, the commander of Paraguay's tank corps appears to be warning voters: Colorados or chaos.
Such muscular warnings reflect desperation over a deeply split party.
Six months ago, Mr. Wasmosy appeared to lose a Colorado primary, winning only 41 percent of the votes. An initial count gave 48 percent of the votes to Luis Maria Argana, a candidate backed by Alfredo Stroessner, the dictator who ruled Paraguay until he was forced into exile by a coup in 1989.
But President Rodriguez, who carried out the 1989 coup, had no intention of allowing a restoration of the Stroessner wing of the party. After closed-door machinations, a new vote count was conducted and Mr. Wasmosy was announced the winner two months ago.
Far from accepting defeat gracefully, Mr. Argana gave repeated news conferences this week describing his party rival as "the fraud candidate." He all but instructed his followers to vote for Mr. Caballero Vargas, an independent candidate who is a great-grandson of the founder of the Colorado Party.
 
1.7 Million Voters
 On the paper ballots, Paraguay's 1.7 million voters can split their votes between presidential candidates and candidates for congress and state governships.
With Mr. Caballero Vargas leading in polls concluded two weeks ago, observers fear that a small margin of victory would be contested in election courts that are controlled by Colorados.
"If Caballero Vargas wins by a small margin, the political crisis could continue for a long time," a South American ambassador predicted here. Esteban Caballero, the social scientist and election analyst, agreed, saying, "The opposition has to win by a clear knockout; a technical knockout will be reversed by the Colorados."
Clear results are not expected until Monday.
"Almost every political observer in Paraguay agrees that Carlos Wasmosy, the Colorado Party candidate, won his party's primary by fraud against Luis Argana," said a report on Paraguay's elections issued this week by the National Democratic Institute. "If supporters of Wasmosy, led by President Rodriguez, were willing to steal a primary, the opposition asks, why won't they try to do the same in a general election?"

HEADLINE: Cuban Groups Seek Lifting of U.S. Embargo

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 8

 BODY:
With Cuba facing an economic crisis, five of the country's most prominent dissident groups have written to President Clinton pleading for a change in American policies that are deepening the island's political and economic isolation.
In a two-page letter delivered to Administration officials this week, the dissident organizations called Washington's economic embargo against Cuba and its policy of encouraging its allies to also adopt trade restrictions "outdated" and "counterproductive." 
 "We insist that the Government of the United States must change its policy toward Cuba," said the letter from the five groups, many of whose members have been repeatedly arrested or harassed.
 
Boldest Appeal to Date
 With the Cuban economy already reeling from the disintegration of the former East bloc and a cutoff in aid, the letter's authors said the unremitting hostility from Washington results only in "dangerous tensions and narrowing of space for diplomatic and political negotiations."
Analysts of Cuban affairs say the letter to Mr. Clinton is the boldest overture so far by the dissidents, who have been issuing increasingly open appeals for months for a new American approach to the island.
Although they say there is little chance that a three-decade-old American embargo on Cuba will soon force the Government of Fidel Castro from power, the dissidents have said that the severe decline in living conditions on the island discouraged Havana from considering reforms that would require greater individual liberties.
Moreover, they say, the weakening of the Cuban economy increases the likelihood of a chaotic transition when change finally does come to Cuba.
"Our position is that we must relax the embargo if we wish to see reforms in Cuba," said Rolando Prats, one of the dissidents, who delivered the letter to Clinton Administration officials during a visit to the United States. "Some say this will only strengthen Castro, but we don't believe so. If the U.S. makes a first step, Castro will be obliged to make a step as well."
 
Growing Malnutrition
 Mr. Prats, who spoke from New York by telephone, is the president of a group called the Cuban Democratic Socialist Current.
In recent weeks the economic picture has deteriorated further with reports that a powerful storm in March destroyed already scarce housing throughout much of the island and ruined vital crops from sugar to orange and plantain. Cuban officials have also recently reported the spread of an epidemic of a mysterious eye disease that some have linked to growing malnutrition on the island.
"The economy is only half of what it was in 1989," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist who specializes in Cuban affairs at Smith College, in Northampton, Mass. Mr. Zimbalist said there were signs that the economy was "bottoming out" after several years of steep decline, but added, "With things as bad as they are and with malnutrition rearing its head for the first time in decades, it is not clear to me what is going to happen."
As their economic situation has grown more difficult, Cuban officials have themselves echoed the dissidents' request that the embargo be relaxed, suggesting that any such move by Washington would be followed by changes in Cuban policy.
In an unusual appeal during a news conference last month, Ricardo Alarcon, the former Foreign Minister who is now president of Cuba's National Assembly, asked the Clinton Administration to "give it a try."
Clinton Administration officials have not publicly responded to the dissidents' letter or to official appeals like that one. Calls this week to senior national security officials in the Administration were not returned.
Experts in Cuban affairs say that with conservative Cuban-American groups strongly opposed to any softening in Washington's stance toward Havana, there is little chance that the Clinton Administration will take any bold new policy measures.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Potholes on Parquet: Celtics Search for Blueprint of Bright Future

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 8

 BODY:
Now Red.
Red Auerbach is in the hospital. What can happen next? 
 In a world uncomplicated by salary caps and free-agency, long before the Celtics became fashionable enough to fill Boston Garden on a regular basis, the stress of springtime would disappear in an annual puff of Auerbach's celebratory cigar smoke. As surely as the swan boats would return to the Public Garden, playoff basketball would be elevated to an art form and another championship banner would be raised to join a glorious collection in those sooty rafters above the parquet floor.
But as the Celtics reel from their latest setback, the shocking discovery that a heart condition had threatened the life of 27-year-old captain Reggie Lewis, the tension of crisis management is pushing the organization into another early vacation.
The stress of a season of passage, controversy, embarrassment, inspiration, despair and pain reached another heightened level of concern when Auerbach, the organization's 75-year-old president and patriarch, admitted himself to Massachusetts General Hospital late Friday night with chest discomfort.
Jeff Twiss, a team spokesman, said Auerbach felt lightheaded after the organization's annual breakup dinner, was not in pain or danger and was undergoing precautionary tests that were expected to last at least until tomorrow.
The Celtics can only cling to a handwritten message on a dressing-room wall from last Wednesday, the night Charlotte ended their season by handing Boston its third first-round playoff defeat in five seasons. A painful year has been left behind. A difficult transition period appears imminent. A reminder remains:
"STAY CALM. STAY TOGETHER."
That these Celtics are seven years removed from Boston's most recent championship era, its 16th N.B.A. title in 1986, has made that task more and more difficult with each passing day.
Lewis's immediate and long-term future remains unclear. A decision to allow him to return to Game 1 against Charlotte after a baffling collapse has raised fundamental questions about medical care for athletes. The decision was encouraged by Lewis, made by team physician Arnold Scheller and approved by senior executive vice president Dave Gavitt.
The Boston Globe reported yesterday that Lewis was to have surgery, possibly this weekend, to have a defibrillating device implanted with the hope that he could resume his career.
 
Testing on Lewis Continues
 But Louise Homer, a spokesperson for Brigham and Women's Hospital, said yesterday that the report was inaccurate and that the testing and evaluation process has not been completed. Another source close to Lewis, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, would not rule out the possibility of surgery, but said a decision had not been made.
The uncertainly surrounding Lewis, the 22d pick in the 1987 draft and a jewel in a collection of recent Celtic choices that were mere imitations, is the most serious development in a period of decline.
Boston has endured the retirements of Larry Bird and, now, Kevin McHale. Robert Parish, the last of Boston's Big Three if he signs a new contract, was found in possession of marijuana in February. Alaa Abdelnaby, who was acquired from Milwaukee in December faced a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession from his time with the Bucks.
Ed Pinckney's season was ended after seven games by surgery to his left knee. Sherman Douglas left the team temporarily in December for personal reasons. John Bagley's infant son died as the result of a heart problem last month. Rookie forward Marcus Webb was released by the team in March, hours before being arrested on an aggravated rape charge. Webb was subsequently indicted on two counts of rape.
 
Memory of Bias
 And not far from the surface of the collective Celtic memory is the knowledge that Len Bias, whose drug-induced death took place the day after Boston made him their No. 1 selection in the 1986 draft, could have been finishing his seventh season and entering his prime.
Parish, the 7-foot- 1/2-inch center, will turn 40 in August. His agent, Bob Wolff, said he was told by the Celtics on Friday that a contract should be settled soon, and would have been already if not for Lewis's condition.
As Parish dressed at the end of the season in Charlotte, he was asked about the future of the franchise. "I haven't given it much thought, to tell you the truth," he said. "But now that you mention it, it doesn't look real bright right now.
"We've got some talented young players, but it's going to take more than that to be competitive in this league. But you never know what's going on behind closed doors. You don't know what abracadabra Red will come up with."
Now Auerbach is in Mass General. The problem for all those believers in Celtic green is that the National Basketball Association's growth into a sophisticated global entertainment business has eliminated magic from the mix. "We're not a free-market society anymore," said Gavitt, the former commissioner of the Big East conference who joined the Celtics nearly three years ago. "It's not I.B.M. and Wang competing against each other.
"It's the power company and the water company," Gavitt said. "They have to get the public utilities commission to approve their rates. We have to live within this managed economy of the salary cap. So it's not as easy as it was to rebuild a team."
 
Complex Task Becomes Nightmare
 The complexity of Gavitt's task, combined with the intense expectations of a simpler time, became a nightmare last week. Lewis had passed a strenuous treadmill test April 26, three days before the playoff opener against Charlotte. He scored 10 points in the first three minutes. But then, Lewis collapsed face forward as he ran down the floor.
The day before the fourth and what turned out to be final game of the Charlotte series, the Celtics held a 20-minute meeting before practice. Chris Ford, the Boston coach, said the discussion was about basketball.
"And life," Ford said.
It was also indirectly about death. Gavitt sensed three emotions during the meeting, including a concern for Lewis and the need to make adjustments.
"The third was their own mortality," Gavitt remembered on Friday.
"These guys had just taken a stress test with Reggie and Reggie passed with flying colors, and they all did, too," he said. "And they all practiced hard with him for three days and all of a sudden . . . "
He did not finish the thought.
Gavitt had planned to return from Charlotte on Tuesday to visit Lewis. The visit did not happen until Thursday, after the season had ended. Rick Fox was leaving the hospital as Gavitt appeared. Joe Kleine was arriving. "I felt good laying my eyes on him," Gavitt remembered. "You felt better seeing him. I don't think he ever wants to hear the word 'test' again."
But, the springtime hope of the Celtics now rests with hospital test results.
A day before the season was ended, as Gavitt sat outside a dressing room in Charlotte discussing the recent ordeal, he casually began to light up. This was no celebratory cigar, just a plain cigarette. A distressing spring had transformed an act of Celtic triumph into a stressful release. Hadn't he stopped smoking a long time ago?
"I did," Gavitt said, "for a while."

HEADLINE: Taking Names for Cleaner Politics

 BODY:
Maybe it was the fragrance of the Rose Garden that got President Clinton feeling so hyperbolic. His new campaign finance legislation "will change the way Washington works," Mr. Clinton said Friday.
Well, it is a start. What we have here is an important, if imperfect step toward cleaner politics. The plan contains breakthrough provisions for public financing of Congressional races and for eliminating soft money in Presidential campaigns. 
 But there is a glaring flaw, written in to placate House Speaker Thomas Foley. The President's bill fails to curb political action committees sufficiently or even to lower the $5,000 figure each PAC can give to a House member.
Still, the President can say that he is opening the road to reform if he makes Democratic legislators put their votes where his principles are. As the majority, Democrats on the Hill are obligated to fix the weak spots in the legislation, to break threatened Republican filibusters and to pass this legislation before the summer doldrums.
This draft took months of tortuous negotiations in sessions described as group therapy for nervous Democrats. The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, pushed his colleagues to respond to the voters' demands for fairer elections. The House majority leader, Richard Gephardt, now grasps the need for fast action. Mr. Clinton accepted new ideas for curbing Beltway lobbyists.
The foot dragging in the crowd came from House Democrats. Not even face-to-face pleading by Mr. Mitchell and the President could budge Mr. Foley from wanting House members to get a third of their total contributions from PAC's in gifts up to $5,000. By letting the House have this shabby provision, Mr. Clinton and the other Democratic leaders won Mr. Foley's support for the rest of the package.
Why did Mr. Clinton back down on PAC's? It's power politics that the voters ought to remember in 1994. The majority for campaign reform is weak because some Southern Democrats may oppose public financing. Other Democrats, encouraged by Mr. Foley, have said they will support the President on public finance only if they can stay on the dole from PAC's.
The task now is to get quick favorable votes in both houses. Then it may be possible to use the conference committee to lower the $5,000 PAC gifts favored by the House Democrats.
Reformers are willing to give ground on PAC's to save public financing, which they view as the best way to give challengers a chance against Congressional incumbents. The Clinton plan offers vouchers for advertising, mailing and printing to candidates who accept spending limits. In a deft twist, Mr. Clinton would pay for these vouchers by eliminating the tax deduction for lobbying expenses.
His freshest proposal would ban contributions by lobbyists to any lawmaker they've lobbied within the last 12 months. Another approach, less susceptible to attack on First Amendment grounds, would amend Congressional rules to bar such contributions. With the Senate voting last week to disclose lobbyists' gifts, real change in Washington's culture of greed could be at hand.
This bill needs work, but the issue of serious political reform is now before Congress. Mr. Clinton says he intends to educate the public on why public financing can cure corruption and make elections more competitive. He should make a special point of campaigning in the backyards of Republicans who try to filibuster or Democrats who try to weaken this legislation. Voters should pay attention, too. It's time to start taking names.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Smog of Peace

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Generations in world affairs are marked by their greatest challenges. Castlereagh of Britain and Metternich of the Austro-Hungarian Empire maneuvered to create stability and legitimacy in a Europe reeling from Napoleon's victories and defeat. Roosevelt, Churchill and de Gaulle rallied their nations to defeat Nazi Germany and Japan. From Truman to Bush, the task was to contain Soviet Communism and nurture freedom, and it was done.
For the Clinton generation, the challenges are much more diffuse, multiple and uncertain. Bill Clinton and his partners in world diplomacy are playing on a chessboard where international and domestic transactions form a seamless web, where the number of public and private players are barely countable let alone controllable, where the rules are yet to be defined, where the true nature of threats remains shrouded by their very multiplicity and complexity and where it is hard to judge what constitutes winning and losing. 
 The cold war's end has left statesmen in an impenetrable smog of peace. In this new world, there is no central challenge, and therefore there can be no central organizing principle for foreign policy.
Mr. Clinton and other leaders will find it hard to order their priorities. They will have to play all over the board until they can begin to make sense of things. The only sure star to guide them through the smog is this: they should do what they reasonably can to prevent the worst.
Such a modest formula falls far short of the precision of an algebraic equation and the moral clarity of the Ten Commandments. But it can serve to remind world leaders that history will not forgive them if they use economic hard times as an excuse for inaction, if they allow narrow short-term national concerns to destroy the long-term fruits of international cooperation and if they fail to see the ultimate material and moral rewards of being their brother's keeper.
The U.S. and other powers obviously cannot and should not use force in all places where people are killing each other. But to argue that the big powers or the U.N. should not intervene anywhere unless they intervene everywhere is pure sophistry. To intervene nowhere pleases only the foolish god of consistency. Leaders will have to practice highly imperfect international triage and save as many as they reasonably can. They cannot maintain civilization and look away.
The U.S. intervened in Somalia to give its people a chance to restore some order, not to remake Somali society. Similarly in Bosnia, the U.S. and its allies can win no military victory at reasonable cost nor can they extinguish ethnic hatreds by force. But they can use force to give Muslims a chance to defend themselves and lessen Serb genocide. And they need not be dragged into a quagmire if they make plain at the outset what lines they will not cross, as in Somalia.
Free trade negotiators have toiled for 30 years with only limited success to break down trade barriers. Yet without their modest accomplishments, the protectionist tide would have overwhelmed the one sure means to open markets and expand economies.
Asian nations are rapidly acquiring modern arms to match their mighty and growing economic power. Because of the easy availability of such weapons, this buildup cannot be stopped. But it can be attenuated by keeping U.S. troops in the region and by expediting security talks among Asians.
An equally staggering list of "new agenda" issues -- helping Russia, population control, refugees, environment and the like -- demand the attention of all. For none of these priorities are adequate monies available. But courageous leaders must squeeze some money from somewhere lest a tidal wave of misery overcome them.
The world herein described -- where leaders will have to strive mainly to do what they can to prevent an endless array of challenges from overwhelming humankind -- does not lend itself to grand dreams and visions. Nor should it inspire pessimism.
For all the horrors and blinding complexities unleashed by the cold war's end, the smog of peace is far preferable to the fog of war or the fog of the cold war. Peoples long chained in darkness have now tasted freedom, felt its material and spiritual blessings, and will not easily give it up.

HEADLINE: Confidence in Clinton Is Slipping Among Many Business Leaders

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
From his economic summit meeting in December to his budget speech to Congress in mid-February, President Clinton wooed, and seemed to have won over, many of America's top executives, most of whom are lifelong Republicans. The corporate world was charmed by the President's sincerity and intelligence, disarmed by his plans to tackle the deficit and promote economic growth and more than ready to give him a chance.
Three months later, the chorus of executive complaints is growing in volume, as expectations about the economy have deteriorated. And many business leaders, including some who are Democrats and others who supported Mr. Clinton during the election campaign, now say bluntly that the President's handling of economic policy has left them disillusioned and uneasy. 
 "This was the fastest honeymoon since Ernest Borgnine married Ethel Merman," said Jerry Della Femina, a Republican advertising executive who supported Mr. Clinton, recalling a Hollywood romance that lasted 12 days. "It's over."
 
'High Degree of Anxiety'
 Stanley C. Gault, chairman and chief executive of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and an influential business leader, commented: "I don't think there's any doubt today that the business community is very frustrated. They are disappointed. There's a high degree of anxiety and uncertainty."
And Irving S. Shapiro, a prominent Democrat who is a former chairman of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, observed, "Bill Clinton has a repair job to do."
In telephone interviews last week, more than a dozen business leaders said that the President's tax proposals were anti-growth and that the Administration's approach to health care reform -- which could involve a new payroll tax -- could end up heaping heavy new costs on business.
 
Mood Affects Recovery
 That these executives are far more worried than they were a couple of months ago is not just a political problem. Confidence is a necessary ingredient in business decisions to invest in technology, hire workers or start new ventures, so the bleaker mood is bad for an economy that is already on a slow-growth path.
"When you have conditions like this, what everybody does is clam up," said Mr. Gault of Goodyear. "They pull back on spending, they don't hire people, it's wait and see. You're seeing it reflected in the data already."
Mitchell S. Fromstein, chairman and chief executive of Manpower Inc., the nation's largest supplier of temporary help, said: "The process of job formation has a lot of psychology in it. We sense an increasing amount of uncertainty."
And F. Kenneth Iverson, chairman and chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, a steel producer in Charlotte, N.C., said flatly, "Everybody's sitting on his hands because nobody knows what's going to happen."
In addition to the top executives interviewed last week, a monthly survey by Cahners Economics of 400 manufacturing executives found that since February, business confidence has slipped, giving back more than two-thirds of its earlier rise. Earlier surveys found that the business mood started to improve after the election; jumped in December, the month of the economic summit meeting in Little Rock, Ark., and peaked in February, the month President Clinton announced his economic plans to Congress.
 
Defeat of Stimulus Hurts
 That survey supports the observation of several executives that business approval of Mr. Clinton eroded as more details of his economic plans emerged, and also slipped with the defeat of his economic stimulus package in Congress.
The business executives are not alone. A Times-Mirror poll released on Friday by the Times-Mirror Center for the People and the Press found that the President's approval rating had dropped to 12 percent from 25 percent in February among people who voted for President Bush in November, 21 percent from 29 percent among Republicans, and 45 percent from 58 percent among people with family incomes of more than $50,000. The poll carried a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for results based on all respondents.
 
 
Failing Marks as Manager
 As much as the specifics of the Clinton economic plan, it is the President's performance as a manager that has many corporate leaders gritting their teeth.
"It's the disarray," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "These guys can stand a lot of stuff, but they can't stand confusion and chaos. They see this big enterprise called the Federal Government, and they say to themselves, 'Jesus Christ, there's nobody really managing this.' "
And John B. McCoy Jr., chairman and chief executive of Banc One, the nation's eighth largest bank, said: "There was sort of a high when Clinton got elected. Everybody said, 'Let's go.' Now we have 87 agenda items and we're not getting anything."
Yet if the chorus of disappointment is swelling, not every executive goes along.
 
Lower Interest Rates Praised
 "My confidence hasn't deteriorated," said Jerry K. Pearlman, chairman, president and chief executive of the Zenith Electronics Corporation. He said that when he hears business people complain about President Clinton, he asks: "Do you like where your interest rates are today? Do you like the billions you're saving in corporate debt payments?"
And Don L. Gevirtz, chairman and chief executive of the Foothill Group, a Los Angeles-based venture capital firm and a major fundraiser for the Mondale, Dukakis and Clinton campaigns in California, said: "I don't sense a wave of pessimism. People keep buying stocks."
But even these gung-ho defenders of Mr. Clinton's first 100 days have some complaints.
Mr. Pearlman, for example, said: "Right now, we've seen the policies. We haven't seen effective implementation." And Mr. Gevirtz observed, "Their lack of focus lost them the opporunity to turn around the California economy."
"The mood is very bad," said George Hatsopoulos, an active Democrat and the chief executive of the Thermo Electron Corporation, a company in Waltham, Mass., that makes instruments and pollution control equipment. "I still don't think we're going to break the recovery, I tell you it's very scary."
Mr. Hatsopoulos is one of the "high-technology Democrats" who felt that the Clinton victory in November contributed to a revival of the nation's economic confidence.
 
Tax-and-Spend Mix Derided
 Three things seem to be bothering most executives.
First, many dislike the mix of taxes and spending in the Clinton budget. To hear executives tell it, many were initially impressed by the President's commitment to cut the deficit. But as the details of the budget emerged, there were more taxes and fewer spending cuts than many had hoped for. The executives worry that new spending will derail deficit reduction and and that higher taxes will stifle economic growth.
"Most individuals are ready to pay more taxes if the money is going toward deficit reduction," said Mr. Gault at Goodyear. "If you're going to take the money and dissipate it, they won't be interested."
Ted Van Dyck, a Washington political consultant with close ties to Democrats in the business community, said of President Clinton: "He misread his mandate and essentially overweighted the taxes and spending side in his basic package. It's already the largest tax increase in history. Combining it with health care reform could cripple the economy."
A second concern of many executives is that the Administration will try to solve problems on the back of the business community.
"The label of New Democrat got put on the President when he ran, but the business community doesn't see much difference between this Democrat and the prior Democrat," said Mr. Shapiro, the retired Du Pont chairman.
And Mr. Della Femina commented: "Every business person I know has the same look that King Kong had at the top of the Empire State Building when the helicopters started shooting. They are stunned."
The third factor on many executives' complaint list is their qualms about Mr. Clinton's management.
"What I hear," said Mr. Pearlman of Zenith, "is why are so many jobs still unfilled so that nothing's happening, and why are they doing so many things at one time?"
Paul Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts who ran against Mr. Clinton in the Democratic primaries and who sits on eight corporate boards, commented, "A lot of it is the question about focus."
Part of the concern about Mr. Clinton's management is that the Presidential team has too few experienced hands on it. "We have a building full of Rhodes scholars who love their current position but don't have any practical experience," Mr. Shapiro said. That's showing."
 
How to Woo Business Back
 Most executives interviewed said they thought President Clinton could win back the disaffected business community, and they are not shy about telling him how.
The Democrats "need some wins in Congress," Mr. Pearlman said, adding, "They have to pick a few things to get done, run them all the way through."
Mr. Shapiro said, "There's a great question of credibility on whether they are really cutting spending. The public can't put its finger on anything. To get credibility, the White House has to do something major, like get rid of an agency and pick up a lot of money in a hurry."
And Mr. Tsongas insisted: "There is still a consensus that if he does well, we do well. I don't detect any disrespect for Bill Clinton that I used to get about George Bush."

HEADLINE: Three Decades of Dwindling Hope for Prosperity

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
CONSUMER confidence. It has such a reassuring, solid sound. If only it would come back, the economy surely would get better. It was even up a bit in April, the poll takers reported recently, although not nearly as much as last December when hopes were so high for the newly elected President.
But such avid attention to the monthly fluctuations has concealed a most troubling trend. Ever since the 1960's, the optimism of Americans about the economy and their own circumstances has gradually deteriorated. And today millions of people view their future with no sense of certainty that things can get better. 
 Put starkly, the soaring optimism of the 1950's and 1960's that life in America could only become more prosperous has gradually given way to what Richard T. Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan, calls "diminished expectations." The 1970's and early 1980's -- a transition period -- brought fist-banging and frustration as living standards stopped rising for most Americans. And now, particularly over the past three years, the struggle to regain the old prosperity has dissolved into resignation.
"People are satisfied today if they can keep their incomes and living standards from declining," Mr. Curtin said. Other poll takers have picked up the same shift in attitudes, among them the Daniel Yankelovich Group, a market-research firm. "Happiness is being able to cut it with less," said Florence Skelly, the firm's vice chairman. "Rather than trying to climb the economic ladder, people are becoming more concerned with relationships and family and community involvement."
The phenomenon is still too new to trace all its consequences, says Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Northwestern University. But some are becoming very evident. Above all, Americans, having lost the old confidence that next year will bring a higher wage or a better job, have been unexpectedly reluctant to help turn the weak national economy into a stronger one. As interest rates fell last year, for example, many economists thought that homeowners would refinance mortgages to lower their monthly payments. They did refinance, but the savings were not spent on consumer goods. They have gone mostly to pay down debt, to clear the family balance sheet, in case a wage earner is laid off or is forced to take a lower-paying job. Such bad luck, so alien to the 1950's and 1960's, so resisted in the 1970's, is accepted today as anyone's possible fate -- in an age of diminished expectations.
"People were more comfortable with debt in more optimistic times," said William Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Until well into the 1980's, there had been a safety valve. Women entering the work force added a second paycheck for millions of households, and that helped mask the fact that the median individual wage had failed since the early 1970's to keep up with inflation.
"The number of persons per paycheck shrank, but that is gone now," said Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Part of it is that women's labor force participation has leveled off, and some of it is that the birth rate has kicked up as couples who had put off having children finally took the step."
Adjusting to the change, retailers are endlessly offering bargain prices, opening more discount stores and pushing what they call real value. The new ethic is that less is more, Ms. Skelly said. "You don't need 100 shirts, 15 are fine, and you don't need designer watches and Mercedes-Benzes."
Manufacturers hesitate to step up production, despite signs of better times, and for many chief executives layoffs have become more natural than hiring. "A gradual erosion of profit margins has seriously undermined business optimism," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
 
Starting Their Own Companies
 But new companies -- small ones -- are being set up in record numbers, and William Dennis, research director for the National Federation of Independent Business, ties this trend to the diminished American mood. "A good employee says to himself, 'I am not sure of my future with this company,' so he joins with a colleague or two and they start their own business," Mr. Dennis said.
More difficult to fathom is the evolving attitude toward government. Gone is the old faith that government spending programs enhanced prosperity. "The demand for action to deal with some issue and the expectation of success have given way to a resigned pessimism that government is not likely to make things better," said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. The budget deficit has become for the public a symbol of government failure, Mr. Mann argues. The old confidence that government could control events has evaporated, Mr. Curtin adds. And as a result, people accept cutbacks to reduce the deficit, although some economists argue that in hard times, deficit reduction might make matters worse. Presidential rhetoric, which helped to elect Bill Clinton, is aimed at turning this attitude around. "But if Mr. Clinton can't make things better, then diminished expectations might become entrenched," Mr. Jencks said, "or people might grab at some other straw."
The shift from optimism to resignation is most clearly measured in the University of Michigan's monthly poll of 500 representative Americans. The poll goes back to 1951, making it the nation's oldest measure of public sentiment. People are asked whether they believe their own finances and the national economy will be better, worse or the same over the next one to five years.
The answers are converted into an index of consumer expectations. During the 1950's, the index averaged 15 percent above the average for the entire 42-year period, and in the 1960's the average for the decade rose to 17 percent above the long-term average. And then the change came, with the average for the 1970's falling to 13 percent below the long-term average.
The booming 1980's saw a bit of an improvement. That was a decade in which some Americans became very wealthy, many lost well-paying jobs and Corporate America struggled to win out against foreign competitors. But with the election of George Bush and the simultaneous onset of economic slowdown, the index sank for the opening years of the 1990's, to 17 percent below the long-term average.
Separate, periodic surveys show that the majority of people under 45 years of age consider their financial situations to be worse than those of their parents at the same age, while people over 45 consider themselves to be better off than their parents.
But there is a silver lining. The diminished expectations today are not much different from the pessimism in 1950, when the Depression trauma still made Americans expect the worst, not the best. Just a few years of rising prosperity made spirits soar. "This is the land of the booster," Mr. Jencks said. "If people can find anything to crow about, they will get back on the bandwagon."

HEADLINE: Warmth, and Relief, Greet Bushes' Return to Maine

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., May 7

 BODY:
A greeting in pink chalk appeared today on the daily menu board next to the "Help Wanted" sign at the Old Salt's Pantry on Dock Square, "Welcome Home, Mr. and Mrs. Bush."
A couple of blocks away 900 townspeople assembled on the Village Green to cheer the return of this seaside community's most famous summer residents. 
 The Kennebunk High School band tooted lustily, a couple of Boy Scouts alternated standing on each other's backs to find a better view and someone in the crowd held up a sign reading, "We Want a Recount."
The Bushes of Walker's Point are back for the summer, and just about everybody is looking forward to a less hectic pace than that of the last four years, when the town was crawling with sightseers, Secret Service agents, foreign leaders and news media crews. Addressing the crowd, Mr. Bush said he hoped that the community's life would be "a little calmer, a little quieter, a little gentler" now that he is just a private citizen.
He assured local fishermen that they would no longer be inconvenienced by his presence. "Come on in," he said. "The water's fine in the bay there."
In the last four years, a Coast Guard cutter patrolled off Walker's Point, clearing the area whenever the President was in town.
Except for one year in World War II, when he was a Navy fighter pilot in the Pacific, Mr. Bush has spent part of every summer at the family vacation home here since he was a boy. Mr. and Mrs. Bush are expected to stay here until the fall.
 
Third in State, First in Town
 "George and I are really thrilled to be home among friends," Barbara Bush told the crowd.
It was a somewhat bittersweet affair, considering that Mr. Bush came in third, behind Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, in the Maine Presidential vote. He won in Kennebunkport, however, with about 50 percent of the vote.
Although the homecoming was arranged by a loose-knit group of Republicans calling themselves the Friends of George and Barbara Bush, the party was more parochial than political.
There were neighborly jokes and gag gifts. Gov. John R. McKernan, a frequent guest at Walker's Point, presented Mrs. Bush with Maine license plates and a set of state driving regulations. Olympia J. Snowe, the Republican Congresswoman and wife of the Governor, held up a sign reading, "Beware, New Driver in Town!"
Kenneth Raynor, a local golf pro and Mr. Bush's frequent golfing partner, handed the former President a combination putter and fishing pole with a horseshoe attached, representing three of Mr. Bush's enthusiasms.
 
Parking Sticker No. 1
 Town Manager Jane Duncan announced that the Bushes would be assigned the No. 1 residential parking sticker for the municipal Goose Rocks Beach, "and that officially makes you residents, not people from away."
Residents expect to see more of the Bushes now that they are no longer subject to high-powered security. In the past, a simple trip into town might have involved a motorcade of 10 to 15 vehicles, police blockades of side streets and a phalanx of Secret Service agents surrounded by reporters and photographers.
Since Mr. Bush's return here last Sunday security has been considerably less visible than before. He has been able to venture out several times, more or less unobtrusively, if not exactly unnoticed. Despite charges that Iraqi agents had sought to kill Mr. Bush during his visit to Kuwait three weeks ago, security has not visibly increased.
On Monday, Mr. Bush went to Bowdoin College in Brunswick, 50 miles north of here, for a lacrosse match. He sat quietly in the bleachers with his brother Jonathan, whose son Billy played attack for visiting Colby College.
On Thursday, Mr. Bush and a small entourage shopped for household items at a Wal-Mart. He greeted customers and employees who spotted him as he was escorted through the store, but he otherwise created little disturbance.
Mr. Bush is deliberately keeping his distance from the press. At the homecoming he told reporters in the crowd, "I'm out of the interview business."
He also said he would avoid politics for the foreseeable future, although he expressed interest in becoming involved in unspecified civic affairs. "We want to be good citizens of Kennebunkport," he said.
Shopkeepers expressed confidence that the end of the Bush Presidency would not mean a significant decline in the local economy. Cynthia Chadwick, who manages a clothing and jewelry shop just off Dock Square, said there was a difference between Presidential sightseers and regular tourists. Those looking for Presidential sites tend to move through quickly, she said, and tourists, attracted to the town in its own right, are inclined to linger and patronize the stores and restaurants.
The community has a year-round population of 3,500 that multiplies to 25,000 in the summer.

HEADLINE: Rave at Close of Day? You Betcha

BYLINE: By BETSY ISRAEL

DATELINE: DEER PARK, L.I.

 BODY:
It's 10 P.M. at a Deer Park 7-Eleven, and the rave boys wander in for supplies: five jars of Vicks Vaporub, three asthma inhalers and what seems like the entire contents of the Hostess cupcake stand. Bundled inside Day-Glo raincoats and dangling sock hats, they might be fast-food bandits on a sugar high, turnpike kids who rented "A Clockwork Orange" and have frightened the neighbors ever since.
What they are is the latest group of Long Island boys to play dress-up. Back in the 1970's and 80's, many like them -- out of high school, not quite in college -- put on fishnet tights and drove to see "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" in deepest Uniondale. Now, local boys head for Deer Park, in Suffolk County, and a former gay disco known on Fridays -- rave nights -- as Caffeine. "It's all natural," explains a fountain-haired cashier as the boys head out toward the parental Buick. "Caffeine stands for natural highs. Rave is, like, natural speed, just dancing, no gang stuff. It's like" -- and she pauses, watching a hot dog roll over inside a roaster -- "it's like the 60's." 
 Raves were the youth event of the late 80's. They began in northern England, where thousands of kids would spend whole days outdoors dancing spasmodically to very fast "techno" music. Raves were underground and, some said, political. There was talk of releasing the "primordial energy of the Earth through technology." Mostly there was a lot of the drug Ecstasy, mixed with Gluconate, an energy-inducing drink tasting like Gatorade, and amyl nitrite. The star techno deejays were all American, and in time, raves spread to cities in the United States -- to V.F.W. halls and warehouses; one was even held under a Belt Parkway overpass in Brooklyn. Then, as a boy in a gas mask later explains, "the cops came, like, forever."
Caffeine offers a compromise: primary rave elements (a dark, nondescript warehouse; wall-quaking techno) mixed with standard club features like alcohol and advertising (officially, no drugs, at least not on the premises). Ira Levy, the manager, who at 29 has had much experience with clubs and rave, says, "It's like that bar in the middle of nowhere in 'The Blues Brothers,' and the audience can't believe what's inside."
What's inside, say those on thick lines outside, is "not Long Island." Barbara, 18, of Centereach, a "sort of model" in black Lycra and arm-denting jewelry, says that "here, it's not, like, any one sexuality." Her friend John, who works at King Kullen, pushing items forward on the shelf, "leveling them" so there will seem to be more, likes it "that Caffeine doesn't make you be the same boring person."
Here, the club populations of Long Island unite like warring clans. Before Caffeine, there were the Jewish American princess clubs in JAP locales (the Five Towns, Island Park, various "corporate" points along the North Shore). There were "Guido" places, all those South Shore Italian bars and discos ("Joey joints," says one Merrick girl, referring to that patron saint of Guidos, Joey Buttafuoco). And separate from these were black and Hispanic clubs and the traditional bars-with-a-pool-table.
But at Caffeine, midway between North and South Shores, it's all-island: Ravers and bikers and girls in skirts the length of washcloths out to "par-ty!" toblot out the days spent parked behind some doctor's office window or inside Caldor's. Alex That, 23, of Levittown, a co-owner and promoter, explains the draw: "An underground is a weekend; a club lasts for years."
For local kids, the first purely island-born generation, Caffeine is a piece of the city imported 52 exits out on the Long Island Expressway. "You go in the city, like to Limelight," says a girl with purplish Amy Fisher hair draping an eye, "and they look at you and you're 18 and suddenly it's 19 to get in. You just spent 50 bucks getting there, and where are you?" Caffeine provides remedial clubbing, a kind of suburban club bootcamp for kids who think the city is too far away, too expensive, too tough. It's a safe place, with a "real 60's feel." It's true this feeling is safeguarded by large men with flashlights and headsets. "But it's totally free," says the girl with Amy hair, "compared to boring life."
In Warehouse B, a back room lined with carnival games and a case of scorpions, a techno nostalgia night is under way. "It's for people who love the music," says Mr. That, "and they miss their favorite techno from when we opened, like, in '91." Techno, a speedy synthesized hybrid of hip-hop and mid-80's "house" is a highly disposable pop musical form. ("You play it once," says the star deejay Frankie Bones, "and then some other guy plays it, you gotta throw it out. It'sover, dead, get outta here.")
Mr. That and a high school friend, Kevin Kraft, took over the club, then owned by Mr. Kraft's father, "to help Long Island keep up with the music and to educate people about how to listen, how to get into a rave head." The rave head, or philosophy, dictates nonviolent fashion (ravers often look like swaddled scarecrows) and an aerobic nonalcoholic high. "You do what you gotta do to promote the rave head," Mr. That says. "Without it, you get fights. Undesirables." What he means is "you get Guidos," a term that was once used to describe slick-suited Italian guys and that now covers anyone hinting at a too-macho stance, any guy with a Davy Crockett "do"; a muscly tank top; a Coors bottle defensively covering the Levi's crotch.
"Either he goes, O-U-T, or he gets tuned to rave," said Joe Cruz, the bouncer, who has witnessed Guido rehabilitation firsthand. "I haven't broken up a fight in two years here."
And so tonight, "in celebration of peace," says one deejay, it's 1990. There's a linoleum floor strip for breakdancing. There's a bar crowd, buying alcohol instead of the usual Jolt, an all-sugar, high-caffeine cola. Three young Korean kids move on to the floor, hopping lightly in place near the strip. Two hold beer bottles; one hugs an Sesame Street doll strapped to his chest. "The kid feels good when he's wearing Ernie," explains a 21-year-old man selling T-shirts. "Ernie says: We like our childhood. We like that other people don't try to rip it off our face."
On the main floor, the raving floor, are the hardcore boys smearing Vicks on their faces (it enhances the high) and, at the edges, the "spectators," the ones who have accessories -- a sock hat, a disco whistle -- but not the "total body spirit." All around, dressed in bustiers and tent-size jeans, are the girls, working hard tonight at imitating the boys. They toss out rap-like gestures, a modified air guitar. But it's the boys who form the dense sweaty nucleus, the true raving womb at the center.
"Those girls are wearing, like, underwear," comments a 20-year-old unemployed carpenter wrapped in cellophane and reeking of sweat. (True ravers often rave into the next day. Showering interferes with this.) "The underwear girls don't get that it's not about the display of you."
Girls don't "get it," some say, because they try to bring contact into a dance form about solitary movement -- sex as opposed to masturbation. Others believe girls can't rave because they typically carry leather pouches, cigarette cases, actual purses, while real ravers carry knapsacks filled with gear. One boy has stashed two giant pacifiers, Devil Dogs and 30 glow-in-the-dark necklaces. Another has a thermos of Kool-Aid, Flintstones vitamins and a Ken doll. Someone has brought a box of matzohs. A bustier girl passes a matzoh slice to her friend, who passes it on. They cheer as the matzoh makes its way through the crowd. Kevin Kraft, pointing this out, says: "See? Who knows what they were doing before they came. Now they're doing just what they want."
Outside, on a wood-slatted patio arranged in risers, some girls -- silver moons on their faces, glitter webs in their hair -- are skipping around, crooning about how open and "60's" it all is. It's 35 degrees outside but they are coatless; one is barefoot. Their only concern right now is how commercial an article like this might make Caffeine.
"In the 50's and 60's, people left the hippies, the Grateful Dead all alone," says an angry boy. "That's why they lasted so long. Why do we want people from the city coming out to ruin it? This is our perfect little thing."
Sandra and Laura, who claim to be 18 although they also claim to be Levittown sophomores, look around at this perfect little thing, unimpressed. It is cold. They had thought the scene would be weirder. "But," Laura says, "what are you gonna do? Like, sit behind the high school drinking beers?"
"It's boring," Sandra says, wiggling a stacked slinky of bracelets on each arm. "Here, it's more . . . the 60's."
Except that it could be anytime on Long Island. Change the cars, the slang, the preferred drugs, and you still have local kids dressing up for an event that began "in the city" and moved out -- some gender-bending ritual that is so "totally free compared to boring life" that no one notices it's an expertly staged imitation.
"Who cares?" Sandra says. "It's not like you wanna go out with a raveguy."
"You want someone who takes a shower," Laura says, clarifying. "Maybe from Bensonhurst. Or guys from the city."
"We go to the city all the time," Laura says, looking at Sandra, who tries to recall precisely when. "Like it was not too . . . it was recently," Sandra says.
Laura coughs a giggle away as she says, "Once we went."

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
WITH nine districts on the National Register of Historic Places, this Union County city probably has New Jersey's most diverse housing stock.
Stately turretted Queen Annes stand next to Second Empires with mansard roofs and Italianate houses on broad lawns. Most of these large homes were built by turn-of the century businessmen who moved their families to the suburbs and commuted by rail to New York City. 
 The housing stock, which also includes post-World War II Capes, split levels, colonials and ranches, is for sale at bargain prices because of the residual effects of race riots in the late 1960's. Although some neighborhoods, such as the Sleepy Hollow area on the east side of town, with its winding, tree-lined streets and large, custom houses, remain well-manicured, many formerly gracious streets near the center of town, like West Fourth, are blighted, with boarded-up buildings and shards of auto glass on the streets.
Prices range from about $50,000 for a small two-bedroom colonial on a narrow lot to $550,000 for houses with up to eight bedrooms, four baths and four fireplaces on one to three acres on the east side.
"Dollar for dollar, you can't buy what you can buy here anywhere else in the state," said Aaron Campbell, an associate at Century 21 John C. Campbell Realty. "For instance, I just sold a four-bedroom house with a nice fireplace, right near a park, for $136,000."
Mr. Campbell said that he also recently sold a small colonial on McCrea Street on the west side of town for $55,000. Two-family houses near the center of the city go for $90,000 to $125,000.
Most apartment houses are on West Seventh and West Eighth Streets. There are also many apartments in large Victorian homes that have been converted to multifamily dwellings. One-bedroom apartments rent for $500 to $600 a month, with two bedrooms renting for about $100 more and three going for up to $1,000.
One of the residents of the Crescent Hill Historic District is Theodore U. Horger, vice chairman of the Historical Preservation Commission. An engineer at A.T.& T. in nearby Basking Ridge, Mr. Horger owns an 1877 Italianate house and says he enjoys the feeling of living with history and a diverse population.
"My main complaint is the business district," he says. "I would like to see it revitalized."
That district, around Front Street and Park Avenue, has two supermarkets and the usual mix of video stores, banks and small department stores. The largest store in town, Macy's, is boarded up, as are several smaller ones.
Mayor Harold W. Mitchell said he hoped to bring the business district back through a series of incentives, most important of which is the state designation of the area as an Enterprise Zone. This lets store owners collect a 3 percent state sales tax, as opposed to the normal 6 percent. Much of the tax revenue is returned to the city by the state for special capital improvements. Last year, Plainfield used $300,000 of those funds to convert a vacant lot into a downtown park.
"THE city is turning around," said Mayor Mitchell. "We in City Hall have started working with the real estate community, the parents, the schools -- everyone we can who is involved in the system -- to try and make this a better place."
He has also instituted community policing in problem areas and a residency requirement for all municipal employees, a policy that he says made the civil service more stable.
For a small city, Plainfield has a large variety of good, moderately priced restaurants, like Caruso's on South Avenue, with an Italian menu, Freshwaters on Fourth Street, which serves soul food, and Lilly Greenleaves on East Front Street, with an American menu. There are also Jamaican, Colombian and kosher restaurants.
Among the newer residents are Dr. Thomas H. Brown, president of Union County College, and his wife Tressa, a supervisor in the Plainfield Public School District. Two years ago, they moved from Utica, N.Y., after buying a 1914 five-bedroom center-hall colonial on Evergreen Avenue near the city center.
"We just fell in love with the architecture of the city," said Dr. Brown.
Dr. Brown has also contributed toward the renewal of the city by overseeing the revitalization of the Plainfield campus of the college on Church Street, which was shut down in 1990 for a two-year reconstruction. When it reopened last fall, the student body increased from 250 in 1990 to more than 1,000 today.
"We're already seeing a trend near the campus," Dr. Brown said. "Apartment building owners are installing new windows and several new businesses -- a deli, a bakery and others -- have opened to cater to the students."
Although 26 percent of the city's population is white, they make up only 1.5 percent of the 6,700-student Plainfield School District. Superintendent of Schools Dr. Annette Kearney said most of the white school-age children attended private schools in neighboring towns. Dr. Kearney terms this apparent lack of confidence in the system "unfortunate."
She conceded that there were "challenges" facing the school system, including teen-age pregnancies and drugs, that force the faculty to do frequent locker sweeps. However, she said that Plainfield's schools provided a good education and sent 55 percent of their graduates on to higher education; last year a Plainfield High student scored 1540 out of a possible 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests, which are used by colleges to evaluate potential students.
"OVER the past year," she said, "we saw a slight rise in the number of white students in the schools. Perhaps that's because of the recession and the rising tuition in private schools. We hope that it is the beginning of a trend."
The Plainfield School District has 10 K-6 elementary schools, the largest of which is the 612-student Emerson School on Emerson Street. There are two middle schools, which send graduates on to Plainfield High on Park Avenue, and a special education school and an alternative school with programs to keep students from dropping out.
There are two K-8 private schools, the nonsectarian Wardlaw-Hartridge School and the Roman Catholic Holy Family School.
Plainfield traces its roots to 1684, when Thomas Gordon, a Scot from Perth Amboy, became the first settler to build a bark house, with the help of the Leni Lenape Indians, along what came to be known as Cedar Brook. Front Street was part of an Indian trail that connected the Hudson and Delaware Rivers. Until the early 19th century, when the construction of mills attracted workers, it remained a sparsely populated farming community.
ACCORDING to town histories, the first regular passenger service to New York City was the Swift Shore Line, a combination stagecoach to Elizabeth and steamboat to Manhattan. The growing population attracted the Elizabethtown and Somerville Railroad in 1837 and, in 1849, the Central Railroad of New Jersey established a direct connection to New York City, opening the area to commuters and setting off a development boom.
From 1835 to 1869 the population increased more than 11-fold, from 1,030 to 12,000.
Among Plainfield's many historic buildings on the National Register is Drake House on West Front Street. Built in stages starting in 1746, it now houses the Historical Society of Plainfield and the Drake House Museum, with its collection of period furniture. It is open on Saturdays from 2 to 4 P.M.
City Hall, a 1915 Georgian-style brick building with large stone pilasters, is also on the National Register, as is St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, a Victorian Gothic brick structure on Liberty Street.
In all, the city has 253 acres of parkland. The most widely used park is the 86-acre Cedar Brook Park, off Rose Street, which has two softball diamonds, one baseball diamond, four tennis courts, field hockey and football fields and picnic areas.

TUMULT AND SILENCE AT SECOND CREEK
An Inquiry Into a Civil War
Slave Conspiracy.
By Winthrop D. Jordan.
Illustrated. 391 pp. Baton Rouge:
Louisiana State University Press. $24.95. 
 THIS book, Winthrop D. Jordan tells us in his opening sentence, "is a story, but at the same time it is not." With this paradox, Mr. Jordan characterizes the outcome of more than 20 years of investigation into events that occurred nearly a century and a half ago. "Tumult and Silence at Second Creek: An Inquiry Into a Civil War Slave Conspiracy" is at once an effort to capture the experience of black and white Mississippians confronting the implications of the Civil War for Southern slavery and also -- and perhaps even more fundamentally -- an exploration into the nature of historical inquiry and interpretation.
Mr. Jordan, a professor of history and Afro-American studies at the University of Mississippi, has written a work of historical scholarship that leaves its scaffolding standing and visible, a study in which the process of discovery is at least as important as the result. He not only invites the engaged reader to participate in the struggle to understand the past, but he also includes almost all the available evidence in appendixes.
At the center of both of Mr. Jordan's linked objectives lies a single document, a record, in the handwriting of a white planter named Lemuel Parker Conner, of slave testimony before an extralegal examination committee in Adams County, Mississippi, in September 1861. Happening upon the manuscript in a Louisiana archive in 1971, Mr. Jordan set out to make sense of the tumult it described.
In the spring of 1861, he discovered, slaves in Adams County, "on a group of plantations near Second Creek," began, amid the disruptions of a society at war, to contemplate a plan for seizing their freedom. When fearful whites overheard expressions of rebelliousness, they undertook a formal interrogation of implicated slaves in order to stamp out any sparks of insurrection. As a result of their efforts, more than 27 slaves in and around Natchez, Miss., were hanged.
Yet little has been known about this tragedy, and the fragments of information inscribed in the historical record have for the most part been wrong. The "tumult" of the book's title has been surrounded by a "silence" that originally grew out of the desire of 19th-century Mississippians to prevent white panic over potential insurrections.
Yet the persistence of this silence into our own time, Mr. Jordan believes, has hidden from history an event of considerable significance, a slave conspiracy comparable to episodes, like Nat Turner's 1831 uprising, that have come to play a critical part in our understanding of the African-American past.
To make sense of Conner's document, Mr. Jordan draws upon his deep knowledge of American slavery and race relations. In 1968, he published "White Over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-1812," a work that swept across centuries and continents -- European, African, American -- in an effort to identify the sources and origins of white racism. It was one of the most influential and acclaimed studies in the outpouring of work by scholars in the late 1960's and early 1970's that transformed our understanding of slavery. But like many other historians of slavery in recent years, Mr. Jordan has shifted, in his new book, from the inclusive breadth of "White Over Black" to the specificities of time and place permitted in a case study. And similarly reflecting more general scholarly trends, his concerns now encompass black attitudes and perspectives as well as white. Indeed, the special value of Conner's transcription, Mr. Jordan maintains, is that it "furnishes more information about the thoughts and aims of a group of rebel slaves than any other single document in American history."
Mr. Jordan's careful re-creation of the Natchez district of Mississippi in 1861 draws on every source he has been able to find in 20 years of searching and presents not just the economy of the cotton plantation South and the social fabric of perhaps the wealthiest slave-owning elite in North America, but the sights, sounds and smells of that time and place. He traces intricate relationships among slaves accused of participation in "the Plan," explores the reputations, family background and political loyalties of their owners, and discerns motivational ideologies in the fragments of slave statements recorded in Conner's hand. In the tense nature of some of the recorded testimony, Mr. Jordan hears "the slash of the whip" and concludes that "the term examine takes on the stench of euphemism for physical brutality." In the slave states, as Mr. Jordan notes, "whipping as a means of obtaining confessions" was not uncommon.
Yet for all the ingenuity of Mr. Jordan's research, for all the imagination and insight he brings to bear on his scanty sources, for all the richness of context in which he is able to place these events, he cannot, as he concedes at the outset, really tell the story of a slave conspiracy at Second Creek. He hopes instead, he says, to offer a "tapestry" or "something of a story."
But despite this open confession of the historian's inability to weave a sequential tale of cause and effect, Mr. Jordan, in some sense, wants to have it both ways, for he never really questions the basic reality of the plot itself. In order to establish the existence of an organized conspiracy, he reasserts the historian's authority he has ostensibly abandoned. Yet, empowered by Mr. Jordan's own offering of his documentary evidence and by his notion of a necessary arbitrariness and a certain relativism in historical interpretation, this reader finds it likely that the tumult at Second Creek was as much the creation of white fears as of actual slave conspiracy. Mr. Jordan does not satisfactorily establish that an organized plot, of the sort contrived by Nat Turner, ever really existed.
There were a few local observers who took such a view of the matter, judging that the slaves' discussions were largely a form of fantasizing about what they might do when the Yankees were victorious and Armageddon brought freedom at last. Mr. Jordan argues that Conner's document represented a verbatim transcription of slave testimony, but it is difficult to imagine that any frightened white Southerner in 1861 would not record at least some of what he expected to hear rather than what was actually said.
And it is impossible not to believe that white men with whips and guns would extract from terrorized slaves what the victims of the lash knew their oppressors wanted them to say. The slaves' testimony about their intentions toward the planters' women is crucial here. Conner's transcription contains several references by those being interrogated to their intention to "ravish" the planters' wives and daughters. "The persistent naming of individual women," Mr. Jordan notes, "is unique among the documents of slave rebellion in the United States."
As Mr. Jordan recognized in "White Over Black" a quarter-century ago, white fear of black sexuality was a fundamental aspect of the psychological and ideological context of North American slavery. But it was founded more in the projection of white anxieties than in any record of black aggressiveness, even during the upheaval of the Civil War.
What then is the meaning of the references in Conner's document? And what does their presence suggest about the significance of the document as a whole? Would slaves have used the term "ravish"? Does the frequent appearance of the word cast some doubt on the manuscript as a verbatim transcript? Does the attention to sexual violence throughout the testimony perhaps suggest that slaves, expecting death no matter what they said, decided at least to reap the pleasure of feeding their masters' worst fears? Was the plot more fantasy than conspiracy?
MR. JORDAN is not convincing when he dismisses the absence of a specific time and date for action by suggesting that African-Americans did not share white obsessions with temporal exactitude. The failure of the rebels to attend to such details supports a contemporary critic of the proceedings who believed that the slaves' conversations addressed the still uncertain Day of Jubilo.
Historians in the 1960's and 1970's quarreled about the existence or nonexistence of rebellions and conspiracies in order to buttress arguments about the essential docility of slaves or about their willing acceptance of their lack of freedom. There can remain little question in 1993 about the commitment of African-Americans in the Civil War South to their own liberation. More than 100,000 ex-slaves risked their lives as soldiers fighting for that freedom, and countless others emancipated themselves by running to Union lines.
The importance of deciding whether the tumult at Second Creek was a black plan or a white panic is not its relevance to these now outdated questions. It is instead to assess the significance of Conner's document and the accuracy of Mr. Jordan's assertion of its value. Does Conner provide a transparent window into the world of the slaves, or is the document a product and an index of white fears and white racism? Has Mr. Jordan gone beyond "White Over Black," beyond the world of the masters into the world of the slaves? Or has he struggled so desperately to overcome the silences surrounding the slave experience that he has misread white constructions of black men for the men themselves?
In keeping with his promises at the outset, Mr. Jordan's book ends not as a story might, with a resolution. It ends with a curious silence -- a description of a pall that hangs over the land today and the banal declaration that the conspirators at Second Creek "lived in particular circumstances and . . . dealt with particular difficulties. In this they shared with other human beings the universal trial of living and dying each and all in their own way." Having been given the sights and smells, even the documents themselves, we as readers are finally left to decide what it all amounted to -- for the participants and their survivors, for the South, for the course of the Civil War, for America.

HEADLINE: No Room for Sentiment on Immigration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your inclusion of Emma Lazarus's "New Colossus" in "Pleas for Asylum Inundate System for Immigration" (front page, April 25), to whose sentiments some Americans might still adhere: the bitter reality is that we are not the same country we were in 1883. 
 At the time of the poem there were still vast areas of undeveloped land as well as seemingly inexhaustible natural resources. As much as we might like to think that our immigration policy then was based on America's magnanimous character, is it not more likely it was our insatiable appetite for cheap labor that drove open-door immigration policies?.
Now that the United States has entered middle age, it is time for us to acknowledge our inability to continue to absorb an endless stream of immigrants. We can no longer base immigration laws on lofty sentiments. Given our economic problems (most notably the protracted unemployment), we've got to make some possibly harsh decisions on immigration.
The World Trade Center bombing highlights another reason not to tolerate a lax immigration system: the unchecked entry of dangerous individuals harboring deadly anti-American agendas.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding Lags in Los Angeles a Year After Riots

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 9

 BODY:
More than a year after the violent disorders that left much of central Los Angeles in ruins, fewer than half the buildings that suffered major damage have been restored. Most of the rest are either shells of crumbling walls or rubble-strewn lots.
Many conflicting forces have combined to slow the rebuilding: lack of money, problems collecting insurance and getting loans, heavy winter rains, bureaucratic delays with permits, compliance with modern seismic and disability codes, opposition to liquor stores, a depressed local economy and, for many owners, sheer fear and weariness. 
 The shop owners who have reopened say business is good, given the lack of competition. But in the area that was hardest hit, South-Central Los Angeles, the rebuilding has been slowest. There are pockets of rejuvenation where new supermarkets and malls have sprung up, now behind high wrought-iron fences to deter looters and vandals. But miles of seedy commercial streets are still pockmarked by year-old rubble, and full-scale rebuilding remains a distant glimmer.
These are some of the findings that emerge from separate building-by-building surveys of damage throughout the city by The New York Times and the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, concentrating on the three areas hit hardest by the unrest -- the South-Central section, Koreatown and the adjoining Hispanic Pico-Union area, and Hollywood.
 
1,118 Buildings Checked
 In all, 1,118 buildings were checked, and 513 of them were found to have been repaired. Most of the restoration was to shops looted and burned in the riots, which caused $1 billion in damage. But while nearly half the destruction has been repaired in Koreatown and nearly two-thirds in Hollywood, less than a third has in the largely black and Hispanic South-Central area.
Those who have rebuilt have tended to have deep personal or commercial roots in the neighborhoods, while the large numbers of absentee landlords appear to be waiting for signals of better economic times. In the South-Central area, less property is locally owned, there are both fewer people and fewer resources and banks generally have been less willing to lend there than in Koreatown or Hollywood.
The heartbreak, complexity and hope of Los Angeles's travails are summed up in John Williams. Born in the city, the 67-year-old black businessman has made his life in the South-Central district. He owned two adjacent buildings on South Vermont Avenue near Manchester Avenue. He leased one to a Korean furniture merchant; the other housed Mr. Williams's Universal College of Beauty, a thriving business that employed seven people teaching cosmetology to 100 students.
The rioters made a target of the Korean's store, not the beauty school. But they did not realize that Mr. Williams had his office on a mezzanine above the furniture shop, and all of his records were destroyed in the fire. And so was the school when the flames spread.
A year later, Mr. Williams has managed to rebuild and reopen the school, with $280,000 in insurance money that covered most of the $320,000 cost.
Unlike others, he is not discouraged. "I see no reason to run," he said, standing in the fenced-in lot that was the furniture store, whose Korean owner also wants to reopen. "I am going to run back with something better."
 
More Ambitious Plans
 Mr. Williams says he wants to rebuild the furniture store's building even bigger, with other businesses, including another vocational school. He has approval for a $500,000 loan from the Small Business Administration, but that is not enough.
Mr. Williams is one of the few owners to rebuild in his neighborhood. Just across Vermont Avenue are two vacant blocks, 8400 and 8500, that look like Dresden after the Allies bombed the German city in 1945. The blocks once housed a dozen or so shops, mostly Korean run.
A check of county property records suggests why. Like much of the South-Central section, many of the owners on the blocks are Iranians, Koreans and Chinese who have migrated here in large numbers in the last two decades and live in affluent suburban enclaves. For example, the owner of record of numerous burned-out buildings on Vermont Avenue and other main thoroughfares is Eli Sasson of 626 South Spring Street, an office building in downtown Los Angeles. Mr. Sasson did not return repeated telephone calls for comment on why his properties remain vacant lots.
The survey was conducted by visually checking all the addresses in the city that suffered more than 10 percent damage according to a compilation by the Department of Building and Safety after the riots.
 
Korean Stores Damaged Most
 The results quantified what had been apparent from the first day of riots: the brunt of damage was borne by Korean merchants. Forty-seven percent of the heavily damaged buildings were occupied by Korean merchants, though they were often not the owners. This figure was arrived at by comparing the addresses of heavily damaged buildings to those of looted and burned Korean-owned businesses compiled by the Center for Pacific Rim Studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. Over all, according to the center, three-quarters of the wrecked businesses were run by Koreans.
The study findings conform roughly to a recent survey of damage conducted by the Department of Building and Safety. Rather than addresses, the department counted legal "parcels" of land, which could have more than one building and address. It found that of 1,120 parcels that had some damage, 371 remained leveled, 25 had only braced walls and no construction activity, 104 were under repair, 71 were not severely damaged but remained unrepaired, and 550 had been completely rebuilt.
A spokesman for the department, Nick Delli Quadri, theorized that Koreatown was rebuilding faster because of the "cohesiveness" of that community and the self-financing networks the Koreans maintain, but this access to finance and local ownership is lacking in the impoverished South-Central area.
 
An Overwhelming Task
 Many owners have found the task of rebuilding overwhelming. Max and Frances Fenten, an elderly couple who live in the affluent Beverlywood area, owned a block of four leased stores on South Vermont Avenue that is now nothing but a fenced-in lot.
"We are too old to start again," Mrs. Fenten said in a weary tone, adding they would probably try to sell the lot.
Further south on Vermont, John and Ruby Scott, owned a building they rented to a Korean, who ran a minimarket. The Scotts do not plan to rebuild, just convert the land to a parking lot. Not far away, Church's Fried Chicken, based in San Antonio, does not expect to rebuild the fast-food restaurant that was burned to the ground.
But those owners with the money, political savvy and determination to rebuild have found it profitable. One of the fastest to rebuild in the South-Central area was Denmarst Limited, a family-owned real estate company that had its mall on the northwest corner of Vermont Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard burned and looted, with $2.5 million of lost rental income.
Within four months, the company had reopened and even enlarged the mall, which now has 13 shops, all doing good volume because there is so little nearby competition.
"We are committed to South-Central," said Dennis Neeleman, partner with his two brothers, Marc and Steven, in Denmarst. "This is all we know. We had everything down here. It's not like we could just move out to Westwood. Also we had motivated tenants who wanted us to reopen quickly."
But the going has been slower for less well-financed owners, like George Hwang, a 59-year-old Korean immigrant and his wife, Kay. They moved to Los Angeles 23 years ago. Both worked menial jobs for years to save up enough to buy a gas station and then later a six-store mall at West Eighth Street and Vermont Avenue in Koreatown. Rioters burned the mall to the ground, for a loss of more than $1 million.
The two-story mall is 80 percent rebuilt, but will not reopen until September. While his insurer was prompt in paying the claim, Mr. Hwang said he was slowed by the winter rains, contractor problems and city permit problems, and uncertainty about which tenants would return.
Still, the Hwangs are more fortunate than merchants in the South-Central area. Banks have generally been more willing to invest in Koreatown. Also, fewer of the busineses there were liquor stores and were not subject to the same zoning restrictions as the 150 burned South-Central liquor stores. In Los Angeles, each time a liquor store is opened or built a new zoning request must be made.
 
Hollow Insurance Policies
 Many of the Korean merchants found they had hollow insurance policies. Recently about 100 joined in a suit against "nonadmitted" insurers, the many carriers not licensed in California who sold insurance here and have failed to meet millions of dollars in claims. Steve and Alice Kim lost their coin laundry on West Adams Street in South-Central to fire on the first night of rioting. They said it would cost $300,000 to rebuild; but none of their $150,000 insurance with their Texas-based carrier has been paid.
"We are angry at the Government and police, because they didn't protect us," said Mrs. Kim. "We are American citizens. We are paying taxes. How come that kind of insurance company can have a business here?"
Even those businessees whose insurance companies did pay often find other obstacles. For years, Louis Ross ran a small chain of dry cleaners in the South-Central district. Now 77 years old and living in Beverly Hills, he sold the businesses to others about 15 years ago, but kept the property. One of them, on Western Avenue near West 34th Street, was wrecked by rioters. It had both a dry cleaner and a gas station.
His insurance paid promptly, but there is no sign of rebuilding at the lot, behind a chain-link fence. Mr. Ross owns the land free and clear and is eager to rebuild, but is faced with the cost of complying with state and Federal environmental regulations governing gas stations. "I've got an unknown cost of trying to clean up," he said. "This area has always been good for business, but we need a godfather to get it done."
 
Six Months for Approvals
 Miles away in Hollywood, Rob Markley, co-owner of the Atlas Furniture Company on Santa Monica Boulevard has found that his chief enemy in rebuilding is the city itself. He and his father, Les, operated a furniture store, which was looted, and leased four adjoining stores to Korean merchants that were burned. He said that they had their architectural plans to rebuild ready within less than three months of the riots, but that it took six months just to get city approvals.
With only five more minutes needed to complete plan approval, he said, one city inspector refused to work past 5 P.M., causing a two-week delay. Another month was lost in trying to persudae the city there was an alley behind the building, though anyone could drive down it. And just the other day, a building inspector refused to enter the construction site to approve the electrical work because the smell of roofing tar disagreed with him.
Mr. Della Quadri of the Department of Building and Safety defended his agency, saying it had established a "one-stop" permit office for riot victims but that certain hurdles were unavoidable, such a requirements that new construction meet modern seismic and disability standards if the damage was more than 50 percent.
"We are always getting people who say it takes too long," he said. "But there are certain code requirements that have to be met."

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Fighting to Keep Its Tax Breaks for Businesses

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico

 BODY:
Abolish the exemption, the government of Puerto Rico says, and the economy of this Caribbean commonwealth will be crippled for years to come. But the Clinton Administration, intent on raising new revenue to reduce the Federal deficit, is nonetheless moving to revoke a multibillion-dollar tax break for American mainland companies operating here.
At issue is Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, which gives mainland United States companies an exemption from Federal taxes on income earned in Puerto Rico, whether it comes from operations or interest on local bank deposits. Critics here and in Washington assail the exemption as nothing more than an expensive giveaway. 
 Puerto Rico's new Governor, Dr. Pedro J. Rossello, and business groups contend that eliminating the provision will virtually destroy the island's manufacturing industries, which employs about 165,000. It would also deprive the local government of a big revenue source: a tax of up to 10 percent on profits that mainland companies send home from their Puerto Rican operations. If the Clinton plan is adopted, many in Puerto Rico fear that businesses will leave the island and take their bank deposits with them.
 Rebuffed by the Treasury and the White House, Puerto Rico's leaders have come up with an alternative plan and are taking their case to Congress.
"We recognize that, as American citizens, we Puerto Ricans will have to participate in the President's call to sacrifice," said Daniel Lebron, president of the Puerto Rico Manufacturers' Association, in an interview here. "But we are asking that our sacrifice be proportional to our economic situation and that additional unemployment not be created on an island where 18 percent of the people already are without jobs and the per-capita income is only one-third that of the mainland."
But some Puerto Ricans say they would welcome the elimination of the tax breaks, which, they contend, have long outlived their usefulness. They say that the corporate beneficiaries of the system are exaggerating the impact the changes would have on Puerto Rico's economy and that the companies' vows to abandon the island if Section 936 is abolished are empty threats.
The tax exemption is for corporations only. Individuals on the United States mainland, for example, could not use Section 936 to shelter money by placing it in Puerto Rican banks. United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico pay no Federal income taxes on income derived from Puerto Rican sources.
Section 936 is "nothing but a welfare program for the Fortune 500," said Luis Costas, a tax attorney here who has written extensively on the program. "It's a profit-shifting operation that allows companies based in Puerto Rico to purchase supplies and materials from their corporate headquarters at a much lower than usual rate, while selling the finished product back at the highest price, thus inflating profits."
And Miriam Ramirez de Ferrer, president of Puerto Ricans in Civic Action, a pro-statehood group opposed to the tax-incentive program, asserted: "It has had a long trial and it hasn't worked. Section 936 has cost the United States Treasury billions of dollars, and yet in Puerto Rico we still have 18 percent unemployment and a per capita income of just over $6,000 a year."
During the cold war, a tax-incentive program was the principal instrument used by Washington to build Puerto Rico as a free-market, democratic alternative to Cuba. Supporters of the tax-exemption system argue that as a result of the program, Puerto Rico has the highest standard of living in the Caribbean.
 
 
Credits for Wages
 But the Treasury now wants businesses here to pay taxes on profits and interest income. To ease the burden, it is willing to grant companies income tax credits for workers' wages and credits against a tax on interest income based on investments in plants and equipment. Under the Clinton plan, the Treasury estimated that it would raise $7.3 billion over five years from Puerto Rico.
Among the companies operating in Puerto Rico are Abbott Laboratories, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Upjohn and Westinghouse Electric.
A proposal by Puerto Rico's Governor would permit Washington to tax income earned here but would offset that with a 100 percent credit for wages and a partial credit for fringe benefits, local taxes, interest earned on bank deposits and capital investment. Alternatively, the plan would allow for 80 percent of a company's profits to be tax exempt.
The Governor said that his "eminently reasonable" proposal, which has received a cool reception from the White House, would produce $3 billion to $4 billion in revenue for the Treasury Department over five years -- less than the Clinton proposal -- without inflicting unnecessary hardships on Puerto Rico's 3.6 million residents.
 
 
'Numbers Game'
 "What has emerged thus far from the Administration, specifically the Treasury Department, is a numbers game that doesn't take people into account," said Dr. Rossello, a physician who took office in January vowing to lead the island toward statehood.
Of the 975,000 people employed in Puerto Rico, about 110,000, or more than 11 percent, are in manufacturing jobs generated by about 300 companies that enjoy the benefits of Section 936. An additional 55,000 jobs, including many in businesses that supply the tax-exempt companies, make up the rest of the manufacturing sector. Although manufacturing accounts for less than 17 percent of all jobs in Puerto Rico, it generates 40 percent of the island's $34 billion in yearly gross product.
While the Federal Government has provided some form of tax incentive in Puerto Rico since 1921, a tax-exemption policy became the main engine of growth here only in the period after after World War II, when Operation Bootstrap was begun. Proponents of Section 936, which has been in place since 1976, argue that without the measure and its predecessors, Puerto Rico would never have been able to industrialize or to achieve its relatively high standard of living.
 The uncertain outlook for Section 936 has generated considerable alarm and resentment here, dominating headlines and intensifying the debate leading up to a plebiscite on statehood scheduled for November. In March, an estimated 100,000 people marched to protest the changes favored by Washington, and it is not unusual to spot "I Support Section 936" bumper stickers.
Evelyn Berrios was one of those marchers in March. She has worked in tax-exempt factories since 1966, the last 11 years at the Puerto Rico plant of Electro-Biology Inc., a medical instruments company based in Parsippany, N.J., with a plant in the San Juan suburb of Guaynabo. She said any system of incentives that enabled people like her to send two daughters to college and to buy stock in her employer had to be beneficial to Puerto Rico.
 
Drastic Effect Feared
 "We are all very much aware of what is going on and worried that it will affect us drastically," she said. "We don't know what we would do if we lose that. We are willing to sacrifice, but we want to conserve our jobs."
Companies receive as much as $70,000 a year in tax write-offs for each job created under Section 936. Such jobs pay $6.25 an hour on average, excluding fringe benefits, compared with an average wage of more than $12 an hour for manufacturing jobs on the mainland.
Nearly 60 percent of tax benefits -- estimated at $2.7 billion a year -- go to some 60 drug companies that account for 18 percent of the jobs provided by Section 936.
The Clinton proposal strikes especially hard at the drug, electrical equipment and food processing industries that Puerto Rico's government sees as the most promising engines of future industrial growth. Marcos Rodriguez-Ema, president of the Government Economic Development Bank, said his bank concluded that high-tech companies would end up paying an effective tax rate of more than 30 percent under the Clinton proposal -- slightly less than the mainland's tax rate and more than the 20 percent rate under Dr. Rossello's plan.
"That knocks us out of the race" with Mexico to attract mainland companies if the North American Free Trade Agreement passes, the Governor said.
The Clinton Administration plan would also affect some $16 billion in deposits that mainland companies keep in local banks or have reinvested here. That money, large in relation to the size of the Puerto Rican economy, has allowed banks sufficient liquidity to pay low interest rates on deposits, to offer loans at rates slightly lower than on the mainland, to make loans to businesses and to finance the construction of schools, hospitals and roads.
 
 
Taxing Interest on Deposits
 The Administration wants to tax the interest from the deposits, but companies can offset that with an 80 percent credit for the value of their equipment, machinery and facilities here, which total more than $5 billion. The $5 billion in assets would allow for a credit of $4 billion, meaning that the interest earned on $12 billion of the $16 billion in deposits would be taxed.
Officials predicted that the $12 billion in deposits would flee the island; the withdrawal would seriously affect the ability of the commonwealth's government to function. A local "tollgate tax" of up to 10 percent on profits repatriated to the mainland provides the Government with about 12 percent of its total revenue, some $500 million, for which there is currently no substitute.
"It would definitely cause us a gigantic decline," Governor Rossello said of a tax on interest earnings. "It would immediately cost us half a billion dollars a year, a loss that would be reflected in services. If we're already cutting programs because of a budget deficit, and we would have half a billion less, it would mean chaos in Puerto Rico."

HEADLINE: Bosnia Move? Not Just Now;
Few Expect a Decision On Use of Force Soon

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Why is it taking so long? Are they just stalling, or what?
The carnage in Bosnia has been horrifying the rest of the world for a year now. Troops from Britain, France and other countries have been there for months under the auspices of the United Nations, doing what little they could to alleviate the suffering. President Clinton has been talking for weeks about new, tougher actions. 
 Yet this weekend in Washington and in the West European capitals, there was still no agreement on what sort of military action should be taken, or when to start. There was no agreement, in fact, on just how much military action could achieve.
To hear the White House tell it, the delay stems largely from European doubts. But the memory of Vietnam, with futile escalation following futile escalation, with bombing campaigns succeeded by pauses succeeded by more bombing and more pauses, has made American officials, military and civilian, look three times before they leap.
 
No Desire to Rush Things
 This time, they vow, they will have an answer to the question that dogged a whole generation of leaders: If this doesn't work, what next? This time, they vow, they will take the country into their confidence before acting.
Call it prudent, call it fainthearted, there is no disposition on the American side to rush things. Few in Washington see much prospect of allied military moves in the Balkans this week.
The Europeans do indeed remain skeptical about taking any military action, though some are ready to set doubts aside in the interest of maintaining good relations with the United States. The British in particular are loath to see President Clinton intervene alone, get his nose bloodied and then turn his back on Europe.
But the West Europeans, who tend to believe in containing problems rather than solving them, have set very limited goals for any military moves. They want to ease the Serbian pressure on Muslim enclaves in central and eastern Bosnia and prevent the fighting from spreading to other countries.
So, pushed to the wall, they favor the use of air power against the Bosnian Serbs' artillery, ammunition dumps and supply routes because that would not widen the war, even though they question how effective it would be. But they favor it only after giving the international peace plan every conceivable chance (including some that seem pretty inconceivable, like a referendum on the plan that the Bosnian Serbs propose to hold next weekend).
 
A List of European Fears
 The Europeans have compiled, furthermore, a formidable list of things to worry about and talk about before agreeing to go forward. Prime Minister Poul N. Rasmussen of Denmark, whose country currently holds the presidency of the European Community for a six-month period, was here last week, discussing some of the pitfalls.
"Without a common enemy in Moscow," he said, "it isn't so easy to coordinate our efforts. Can we get weapons through to the Muslims? If we do, will they be able to fight effectively? What about the peacekeeping troops already there? Will we bring the Croats back into full-scale conflict? Will the war spread to Kosovo and Macedonia? Will the Russians decide to help their Slavic cousins?"
To many American ears, recitals like that sound like excuses for continuing inaction. Not so, the Europeans respond. A ranking European diplomat insisted on Friday, "We will get an agreement, believe it or not, and we will get it within the next week."
President Clinton said much the same thing. But at least in part, this is a case of the wish giving birth to the thought.
 
Europe Has Different Goals
 The Clinton Administration has much broader goals than the Europeans have, and the gap that results has yet to be bridged. Although Mr. Clinton has concluded that there is no real prospect of rolling back Serbian gains with outside military force, he still hopes to influence the underlying political situation. Unwilling to send American troops to tilt the balance on the battlefield, he wants to allow arms to reach the Muslims and use air power mainly to hold off the Bosnian Serbs until deliveries of heavy weapons to their enemies can be completed.
Mr. Clinton could, in theory, undertake that policy on his own. But his advisers think it would be political suicide to try to do so at a time when American voters, fretful about the domestic economy, think Europeans should take the principal role in looking after Europe. Senior figures in Congress who hope to push through a measure of support for the President when the moment comes say they can not do it if he does not already have the Europeans on board.
Mr. Clinton did not take the steps he could have taken while Secretary of State Warren Christopher was making the rounds of the European capitals last week in search of consensus. He did not appeal to the American people on television for support for action in Bosnia; he did not even use his weekly radio speech to do so.
Nor did he announce his strategy publicly and call upon the Europeans, once Mr. Christopher's initial talks had been completed, to follow his lead.
The truth is that almost no one in any of the major capitals is terribly confident that allied arms can make a decisive difference, no matter how they are employed. One of Mr. Clinton's chief advisers spoke the other night about the President's plan as "the least bad thing we could come up with in a situation where we think we have to do something, if we don't want to seem to be condoning genocide."
Lord Owen, the European Community's peace negotiator, said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" today that "you will not solve the problem at 10,000 feet." But it has not been settled by months at the bargaining table, either, and solving it on the battlefields would entail more fighting and more widespread death and destruction.

HEADLINE: Congressmen Urge Action if Iraq Hatched Plot to Assassinate Bush

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Senior Democrats and Republicans in Congress urged the Clinton Administration today to take military action against Iraq if it is shown that its Government plotted to assassinate former President George Bush in Kuwait last month.
"We should retaliate," Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." He added: "We cannot tolerate that kind of an action against a former President of the United States. It's just outrageous." 
 Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said on the same program that a military response "is the only thing that Iraq would understand."
On Saturday, the White House said law enforcement agencies had sent investigators to Kuwait to determine whether Iraq tried to kill Mr. Bush in retaliation for his role in forging the coalition against Baghdad in the Persian Gulf war. Kuwaiti officials have accused 17 people, including 11 Iraqis, of conspiracy to kill Mr. Bush and to conduct "other acts of terrorism, infiltration and robbery." Sixteen of the suspects are in custody in Kuwait.
 
U.S. Waiting for Proof
 Clinton Administration officials have said they have found strong but inconclusive evidence that Iraq directed the assassination plot. But with events in the Balkans preoccupying the White House, officials have signaled that they will not act swiftly and will instead await the conclusions of the investigation.
American officials said this weekend that they had no doubt that the group planned one or more remote-controlled car bomb attacks during Mr. Bush's visit to Kuwait City April 14-16, when he received an award from the Emir in recognition of the American-led military operation that drove the Iraqis from Kuwait in February 1991. But they said that it remained unclear where or when the group intended to move the vehicles to sites near Mr. Bush's route, and that it remained possible that the plot was intended only to disrupt his triumphal tour.
Iraqi officials have ridiculed the accusations. In a statement issued in Amman, Jordan, on Saturday and reported by Reuters, the Iraqi Information Minister, Hamed Youssef al-Hammadi, said, "The sheiks of Kuwait in coordination with American intelligence are plotting another deception to fool American public opinion in order to justify a new aggression on Iraq and tighten the economic siege imposed on it."
Mr. Hammadi said the fact that the accusations had been made by the Kuwaiti Information Minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Saud al-Sabah, made it clear that the story was fabricated.
"Sheik Saud al-Sabah is a big liar because it is known that his daughter, Nira, was used by the American intelligence to mislead Congress and American public opinion by concocting the known incubator story before the military aggression on Iraq," Mr. Hammadi said. He was referring to the testimony by Sheik Saud's daughter to Congress while the sheik was Kuwait's Ambassador in Washington about reported atrocities by Iraqis during their occupation of Kuwait. The testimony has since been widely discounted, although it helped to shape American public opinion in favor of Kuwait.
Representative Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip from Georgia, today called upon the military to "drive Saddam Hussein out of power." Asked on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" whether he advocated the assassination of Mr. Hussein or a military invasion, Mr. Gingrich said he was "talking about just simply increasing the pressure."
"I think as a symbol of America and as a human being, President Bush and his family deserve to know that we will not tolerate a government trying to assassinate an American," Mr. Gingrich said.
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, cautioned against taking any action unless the evidence was clear that an assassination plot had been sponsored by the Iraqi Government. "Some action of a definite responsive nature probably needs to be taken if it's absolutely clear, but it isn't, at least in the public sphere, clear that the evidence is overwhelming or without any ambiguity," the Democratic leader said on the CBS program.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Push for a U.N. Police Force of 500 for Haiti

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada, May 9

 BODY:
In an attempt to guarantee a peaceful transition to democracy in Haiti, the United States and several allies will sponsor a Security Council vote this week to authorize the quick deployment of a 500-member international police force there, Administration and United Nations officials said today.
On Monday, Foreign Ministers from the Caribbean will meet here with United Nations diplomats who will brief them and seek their support. 
 The Council is expected to approve the measure, officials involved in planning the force said.
 
Rapid Approval Predicted
 "I would think this would move very rapidly," a senior Clinton Administration official said. "The only major obstacle would be a logistical one, pulling people together from a variety of places."
Although the exact composition of the force has not been determined, officials said it was likely to be dominated by French- and Creole-speaking countries, including France, Canada and several Caribbean countries. Officials said Venezuela, which has also been a strong supporter of the idea, might also take part.
President Clinton first spoke last week of the necessity of an international police force to restore the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown in a violent military coup in September 1991. Since then, senior Administration officials have said that such a force is required in Haiti as diplomatic efforts proceed, because of sharp class divisions, a long history of political violence and a pervasive climate of fear.
The emerging settlement calls for the granting of an amnesty by Father Aristide to his enemies in the army, the resignation of the army command, the formation of a new, broad-based Government, the injection of large amounts of foreign aid and technical support and Father Aristide's early return from exile in Washington.
Officials close to the Haitian diplomacy have said that although no final agreements are in place, the country's military command is expected to support the deployment of the international police force.
 
A First for the U.N.
 United Nations officials said this was the first time the organization had mounted an international police force in a country not engaged in a civil war or international conflict.
Opponents of Father Aristide are concentrated among Haiti's small privileged classes. They have voiced deep fears that the President's supporters, concentrated among the poor, will exact revenge on many who supported the army's overthrow of the populist Roman Catholic leader.
In recent weeks, diplomats involved in negotiating a return to democracy in Haiti have spoken with increasing confidence that with strong international backing, a resolution of Haiti's 19-month political crisis is very near.
"We are optimistic about this thing going forward now," one official said. "That means all the Haitian parties can see their way to an accord that they can agree to."
Father Aristide, concerned about the constitutionality and the political consequences of calling for foreign intervention, has long publicly opposed the use of international force. Asked whether he approved of the police force, as his advisers and diplomats maintain, the Haitian President said on Friday: "I continue to be in touch with the Secretary General. My comments will come at the appropriate time."
If any party opposes the police deployment, officials said, it would be Haiti's de facto civilian Government, which is not recognized abroad and which would be almost immediately replaced under any settlement.
 
Reassuring Current Officials
 "The irony is that we are doing this in large part to reassure the de factos of their safety," one official close to the negotiations said. "But some people will no doubt scream about the violation of sovereignty."
One of the thorniest problems of the negotiations for President Aristide's return has been how to achieve the resignation of most of the army high command without provoking sudden anarchy in the army and in society.
While the prospect of presidential amnesty is meant to reassure commanders who must resign that they will not be prosecuted by the new Government, diplomats have long felt it essential to provide guarantees for ordinary soldiers, many of whom have been involved in violence in the country since the coup and fear reprisals.
The quick deployment of a police force, along with the rapid infusion of economic aid and the subsequent start of many development projects, has been seen by many as a linchpin of stability that would help eliminate the fears of ordinary soldiers.
Once the transition is under way, diplomats said, the army itself will become the subject of extensive reforms. Under the current plans, a professional civilian police force will be created for the first time in the country and the army reduced in size to about 3,000 soldiers from its current 7,000.

Treasury's Debt Shift Unlikely to Meet Goal

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
No matter who eventually wins the debate over the wisdom of the Treasury Department's decision last week to make a major shift in its debt- management policy, it does not appear that the savings will tote up to the $16 billion goal the Administration set, regardless of how interest rates move in the future.
The review of the Treasury borrowing practices, for better or worse, was driven by the Administration's promise of a budget savings of $16 billion over the five fiscal years 1994 through 1998. The Senate Budget Committee, in preparing its own budget plan earlier this year, came up with a proposal to meet the Administration's savings goal by shifting some longer-term borrowing with higher interest rates to shorter-term borrowing with lower interest rates. 
 When the Treasury announced its policy shift last week, saying it would give a new emphasis to shorter-term borrowing, some analysts on Wall Street indicated that the savings would be close to that of the Senate Budget Committee figures because the Treasury and Senate plan were similar, although not identical.
 But according to some Government analysts in Washington, the initial reviews of the Treasury plan indicate that only one-third to two-thirds of the $16 billion savings goal will be achieved. "There is no question" the savings will be lower, said one Administration official. "This was not an exercise to maximize the budget savings," the official explained.
The range in the estimates may have more to do with adjustments in budget base lines than with the actual savings achieved, which means the better estimate may be near the bottom of the range. A base line is an assumption of what would have occurred if there had been no change. It also sets a starting point from which to measure savings. It already appears that the Administration may use a budget base line that will give it a higher savings estimate.
According to these analysts, who would discuss the preliminary analysis only on the condition that their names not be used, there are two major differences between the Treasury plan and the Senate Budget Committee proposal, whose $16 billion savings estimate was prepared by the Congressional Budget Office.
One big difference is that the Treasury proposal cuts the annual issuance of 30-year bonds by about 40 percent, while the Senate Budget plan cuts the 30-year auctions by 50 percent. The Treasury, moreover, did not reduce the issuance of five-year notes, while the Senate cut them by 20 percent.
 
Another Difference
 The other difference is that the Treasury is shifting approximately $76 billion of longer-term borrowing ($37 billion from 30-year bonds and $39 billion from 7-year notes, which were eliminated) to 2- and 3-year notes and to Treasury bills, which range from three months to a year. The Senate Budget plan shifted all this longer-term borrowing to Treasury bills, making the interest-rate savings greater.
The savings is the difference between the average rate on the longer-term issues and that on the rates of the shorter maturities, which would be lower under the Senate plan because only bills are included.
The differences between the Senate and Treasury plans could change the projected savings by billions of dollars, officials said, although they would not give specific figures, which are still being worked out. And, as in all budget reviews, the final results can change.
One of the reasons for not shifting all the longer-term borrowing to Treasury bills is that it takes away almost all the Treasury's flexibility in managing the Federal debt. Another factor is that the one-year Treasury bill is a major factor in setting the interest rates on adjustable home mortgages. By not transferring so much of the Government's debt to one-year bills, the Treasury will place less pressure on home mortgage rates -- an end much harder to achieve under the Senate plan.
 
 
Importance of Base Line
 The reason for the wide range in the estimates of savings, officials said, comes from the choice of the base line for calculating the savings.
In one set of Government estimates, the starting point for the annual issuance of 30-year bonds uses as a base line the $9.25 billion quarterly auction in February, which already reflected a $1 billion cut made by the Clinton Administration. But in another Government-estimated base line, the total issuance is based on the higher level in the previous quarterly auction under the Bush Administration, which means the reduction in the size of the auction is larger, so the savings is greater.
The savings estimates, even if they are lower than expected, are easy to lock in -- on paper. All one needs to do is calculate the difference between the interest costs on 30-year bonds (6.84 percent) and the interest costs on 7-year notes (5.54 percent) and the interest costs on Treasury notes and bills with maturities of three years and less that will replace the longer-term borrowing.
A selection of the interest rate assumptions for the next six fiscal years that the Clinton Administration is using shows the three-month bills at 3.1 percent; 3.5 percent; 4.2 percent; 4.7 percent; 4.8 percent and 4.9 percent. The figures for the 30-year bond are 7.3 percent; 6.9 percent; 6.9 percent; 6.8 percent; 6.8 percent and 6.7 percent. The figures are given by fiscal year from 1993, which ends Sept. 30, to fiscal year 1998.
The broader question of the advisability of the debt-management shift disclosed last week will depend on how interest rates perform over time. If, for example, the rate on the shorter-term debt averages less than 6.84 percent (the rate now available on 30-year bonds for 30 years) the Treasury will do well. But who will be checking?

HEADLINE: As Ratings Stall, Clinton Tries Tune-Up

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
In many of the ways that count, the spirit of the 1992 Clinton campaign is dead.
That spirit, represented by the "War Room" in the Little Rock, Ark., campaign headquarters, was supposed to live on in a World War I-era situation room in the Old Executive Office Building. But the young aides who staffed it -- trained in the art of quick response, coordinated message-making and effective communication that rooted out many a land mine during the campaign -- lack experience with the perils that lurk in real-life threats like a Republican filibuster, debates over aid to Russia or war in the Balkans. 
 "You had a lot more capacity to kind of shape the reality you want," one White House official said wistfully last week of the campaign days.
The Democrats, frozen out of executive branch leadership for 12 years, have discovered that governing is less a political campaign than an exercise in juggling flaming torches.
 
Some Lessons Learned
 Smarting from their early stumbles, Administration officials are determined to learn from their mistakes, turn to the bureaucratic process of nonstop meetings and make better use of the persuasive speech-making skills of the man they see as their best weapon: Bill Clinton.
Having recognized that they made a crucial mistake in trying to win passage of their economic stimulus plan without Republican support, the Clinton team now sees to it that Hillary Rodham Clinton meets with Republicans as well as Democrats when she seeks Congressional support for health-care overhaul proposals.
Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, has taken steps to rein in the operations of the West Wing, hiring a second deputy and coordinating groups that meet three times a week to plot how to win passage of the President's budget.
And Mr. Clinton will take to the road again for three days this week to try his hand at selling his economic program to business people in Cleveland, workers in Chicago and students in New York. At each stop, aides said, he plans to talk about tax fairness and to develop a theme that paints his opponents as protectors of the rich.
"He can focus the debate in a way that no one else can," said Bruce Reed, a domestic policy aide.
 
Too Busy to Chat
 When asked at a news conference on Friday about a significant drop in his approval ratings in recent polls, Mr. Clinton replied: "I haven't been out there as much as I should have been engaging the American people directly since February. I've been doing huge, heavy lifting and long meetings on health care and the economy. That's what I've been working on. And I've been forced to deal with a lot of other issues."
But he also acknowledged the difficulty of keeping connected with the public the way he did during the campaign. "You can't carry on a totally continuous campaign," he said. "It's simply not possible."
One senior Administration official -- none wanted their names attached to any concessions of imperfection -- said: "We have all of these campaign commitments, but we have to translate them into government and governing. That's where the fundamental breakdown occurred."
These are tough learning times at the White House. As senior officials guard their turf, their egos and their access to the President, they face the challenge of executing their chunk of the President's crowded domestic agenda at a time when that agenda could be overshadowed by the potential for American military intervention in Bosnia.
 
Surge of Disapproval
 "The economy, health care, national service, campaign and lobbying reform and welfare reform -- that's what we've been working on," said Mark D. Gearan, the deputy chief of staff who will now oversee long-term planning for politics and policy. "We have to make sure our focus and discipline remains that. Make sure the President's time, activity and efforts reflect the singularity of our focus."
The longer it waits, the harder it gets for the White House to get back on track. A CBS News poll conducted May 4-6 found that 50 percent of Americans disapproved of the way Mr. Clinton was handling the economy, while 38 percent approved. In a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted in late March, only 37 percent disapproved of his economic performance, and 47 percent approved.
Even more damaging, the new CBS News poll shows that the public no longer perceives Mr. Clinton's economic plan as fair. Forty percent say the plan is fair to people like themselves, while 48 percent say it is unfair. In the March survey, 48 percent saw it as fair; 39 percent saw it as unfair.
The CBS News telephone poll of 1,233 adults has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, as did the survey in March.
 
Seeking Clarity in Fuzzy World
 White House officials seem puzzled that they have been driven so far off course in public perception. To them, the goals the President outlined at a post-inauguration staff meeting at Camp David, the Presidential retreat, all look like part of a master plan. To the public, they may seem more like disparate pieces of an overly ambitious and scattered agenda.
Many of the President's advisers look fondly back on the Little Rock days, when the end of an uphill battle was victory. They remember how clear their mission seemed just after the inauguration.
"If that was near perfect coordination in a near perfect context, we now have to have a structure that is tailored toward the best possible coordination in an inherently imperfect context," said one of these advisers.
There has been a singular lack of blame emanating from the West Wing offices of the President's senior staff. Even as the top officials were admitting that their communications had become muddled, there has been no penalty for one of the President's closest aides, George Stephanopoulos, the communications director.
Instead, they have all vowed to learn from the mistakes that it took them weeks to even admit.
"Clearly that's part of the job of the President, and us, in helping him," said Mr. Stephanopoulos. "It's how do you talk about and communicate big things even as you're putting all the pieces together underneath it."
 
Hopes on Health Plan
 White House officials complained that they had not gotten the credit they deserved for their victories and that early defeats enabled "some people who would not know a tough choice if it hit them in the face to go around and suggest that we hadn't done enough."
Administration officials are hoping that when the health-care plan is finally announced next month, its broad sweep and its accompanying public relations pitch will obliterate many of the negative perceptions of provisions that have leaked out.
"We're planting a lot of seeds," said an official involved in the weeks of meetings to define a new image of Presidential policy. "We need to do the best possible job in making the tax issue a tax fairness case, because that is the reality of the President's program."
In the meantime, the White House is culling and assembling bits of good news wherever it can find them. Rahm Emanuel, the White House political director, was cheered by the increased voter turnout in recent special elections in Ohio, Wisconsin and Mississippi. People are engaged, he said.
And it is still early, the officials stress. There is plenty of time to develop a theme that portrays the President's program as the answer to voters' demands and the Republicans' objections as gridlock by filibuster.
"We have to do better in stressing that when we unveil a program that makes it easier for middle class students to pay for college, that's opportunity; that when we reinvent government and consolidate urban programs and bring tax incentives, that the President is fighting for opportunity and for jobs," said one adviser who has a hand in writing the President's speeches. "I don't think the question is changing the playbook so much, as executing the plays better."

HEADLINE: The Changing Definition of Health Insurers

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Even without Federal health-care reform, the nation's $300 billion health insurance industry is on the verge of a transformation.
Many of the nation's 500 or more health insurers are expected to be driven out of the field in the next few years as the industry shifts its business away from traditional insurance and toward the delivery and management of health care. 
 This process would speed up under a health-care plan expected from the Clinton Administration. Analysts predict that such a plan would drive tens or hundreds of thousands of health insurance agents out of their jobs and speed the pace at which Americans are compelled to join health maintenance organizations.
 
Invested in H.M.O.'s
 In the end, they say, the health-care changes would also come as a tremendous boon to the industry's giants: Prudential, Cigna, Aetna, Metropolitan Life and Travelers as well as the nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. Those companies stand to benefit because they have already invested billions of dollars in health maintenance organizations, a way of controlling costs that is favored by the President's health policy planners.
The impact of such changes on the public is hotly debated. Small companies say that the increased concentration expected to result from the Clinton plans would eventually hurt consumers by centering too much power and business in large companies. The big companies are not as innovative or responsive to the public, the small companies say.
But the five big commercial insurers, which have formed their own lobbying group to support the Administration's approach, dismiss such arguments. They say that many traditional indemnity insurers that have looked to insure only the healthiest customers would hardly be missed.
Whatever happens in Washington, economists, analysts and insurance company leaders say most Americans in the next few years will find themselves changing health insurers or dealing with insurers that have changed vastly.
"The traditional indemnity health insurance industry is biologically extinct," said Alain C. Enthoven, a Stanford economist and one of the architects of the type of health-care change embraced by Mr. Clinton and known as managed competition. "Those changes are already under way. It will just happen faster if managed competition comes into being."
Besides the giants that have committed themselves to becoming operators of H.M.O.'s, the industry is made up of a hodgepodge of companies. They range from relatively large insurers like the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, which insures more than a million people, to tiny operations like the Universe Life Insurance Company of Lewiston, Idaho -- many of whose 50,000 rural customers found their insurance through associations of peanut, soybean and poultry farmers.
As medical costs have spiraled upward, some insurers have invested billions of dollars in H.M.O.'s and other systems designed to control what services are used and what patients are charged.
By last year, 41 million Americans had already enrolled in H.M.O.'s, up from 19 million in 1985, according to the Group Health Association of America, a trade organization of H.M.O.'s. Of all H.M.O.'s, 42 percent are owned by commercial insurance companies or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
Some H.M.O.'s employ doctors in a clinic or hospital-like buildings. Others run networks of hundreds or thousands of doctors who practice in their private offices. In either case, people joining H.M.O.'s must usually abandon the traditional system of choosing any doctor they want and being reimbursed from health insurance plans.
 
H.M.O.'s Ready to Grow
 Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, a Wall Street research firm, said that even without any new Federal health-care changes, the percentage of Americans with private health insurance who are enrolled in H.M.O.'s would grow from the current 24 percent to 45 percent in the year 2000. The process, he added, would be much faster under managed competition.
"I envision the insurance companies transforming themselves into H.M.O.'s or getting out of the business," Mr. Abramowitz said.
The precise impact on the health insurers would depend on the structure of the health alliances, and there is still much debate over which insurers would survive.
Mr. Abramowitz estimated that 100 of the approximately 500 health insurers in the nation would remain in the business. The majority of the 72 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and Prudential, Cigna, Metropolitan Life, Aetna and Travelers would have a natural advantage because of the heavy investment they have made in H.M.O.'s and other managed-care systems.
Although health insurers' profit margins would suffer from any form of price controls, Orin Kramer, an analyst who runs Boston Provident Partners, an investment group in Fort Lee, N.J., said the insurers that already had a large foothold in the H.M.O. business would benefit greatly from the Administration's plans to pay for insurance for the 37 million Americans who are now uninsured. In essence, the Government would pay tens of billions of dollars to create a huge new pool of customers for health insurers.
 
Benefit to Big Insurers
 Michael Stocker, the president of Cigna Healthplan Inc., said that if the Clinton plan allowed large employers to choose health insurers outside the health alliances, as expected, that would probably benefit larger insurers, too. Large corporations with operations in many states tend to favor dealing with large insurers that also operate in many locations, Mr. Stocker said, rather than contracting separately with many local insurers in different areas. Small- and medium-sized companies that have not invested in H.M.O.'s would find it difficult to survive.
"The driving issue is whether an insurer has invested in networks that include doctors and hospitals," Mr. Stocker said.
That prospect has caused a schism in the lobbying effort of health insurers. The five giants recently broke off from the Health Insurance Association of America, their longtime trade group in Washington, to form their own organization, the Coalition for Managed Competition, which is closer to Administration thinking on most issues.
On the other side of the spectrum is the Council for Affordable Health Insurers, an organization representing 30 small indemnity insurers that cater to individual customers. It paints a bleak picture of the future if most consumers have to buy their insurance through health alliances.
Its spokesmen argue that managed competition would lead to dominance of the industry by national behemoths unresponsive to consumers. After the shakeout, they say, larger insurers could form an insurance oligopoly.
"Innovative small companies that have fueled competition very well might not be there anymore," said Douglas J. Freeman, the chief executive of Medical Benefits Mutual Life Insurance in Newark, Ohio, an insurer of only about 50,000 customers. "General Motors, if they were not forced by competition to design a new body shape, would still be offering us the Chevette."
Theorists of managed competition, as well as the leaders of the nation's largest health insurance companies, say such an outcome is extremely unlikely. The concentration of business in large companies will be limited, they say, because even companies like Prudential and Cigna lack the capital to underprice or acquire all well-run local enterprises.
In addition, advocates of health-care change argue that the public would be glad to see indemnity insurers that "cherry pick" customers -- or take only the best prospects -- go out of business. For many of these insurers, they say, profits have depended on selecting the most healthy to insure while studiously rejecting those most likely to get sick. Their aim, such critics say, has been to serve least those who need insurance most.
In any case, they say, the health alliances would have to be structured to assure that there are enough companies for competition to exist.
"What you want is enough competition to make sure there is a lot of choice," said William P. Link, executive vice president of the Prudential Insurance Company. "There will be many, many more than just a few local companies."
Among most health insurers, planning has inevitably turned to finding new niches. Some talk about abandoning customers entirely and processing electronic claims for the insurers that remain. Others believe that significant parts of America will still need traditional insurance plans.
Mr. Freeman of Medical Benefits Mutual Life said his company, which insures residents of Ohio and Indiana, was concentrating on developing networks of physicians in small cities and rural areas. Recent research, including an article in the New England Journal of Medicine in January, suggested that perhaps 30 percent of the nation's residents live in areas where the population is not dense enough for managed competition to exist.
"We are a part of the community in Newark, Ohio, and we feel we can remain a part of the community," Mr. Freeman said. "We are going to change. But I believe we are going to survive."

HEADLINE: Some See Half-Empty Glasses in U.S.-China Pacts

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 9

 BODY:
To hearty congratulations, the United States and China have reached a series of agreements in the last few years aimed at resolving disagreements in areas ranging from trade to human rights. Now those agreements are generating their own disputes about whether China is abiding by its promises.
The latest commotion came late last week with the disclosure of growing evidence that China might have shipped medium-range M-11 missiles to Pakistan. Such shipments would violate China's promise, first made to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in 1991, not to sell such missiles. 
 To some of China's critics, a violation of the missile agreement would fit into a pattern of broken promises. Such critics, including human rights campaigners and some business executives and diplomats, say China has also failed to follow through fully on agreements to allow all dissidents to leave the country, to open its markets and to permit inspections of prison factories.
"The conclusion you have to draw is that the Chinese Government lies a lot," said Robin Munro, a researcher for Asia Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch in New York. "Its credibility is extremely low."
 
China Is Seen as No Different
 Others dispute that assessment, pointing out that disagreements about abiding by agreements are common in relations with Japan and Europe as well. What is special about China, they suggest, is that human rights groups are particularly quick to criticize it.
Indeed, one of the most direct violations of any agreement between two countries recently can be attributed not to double-crossing Communists but to politically ambitious Americans. That was the Bush Administration's decision in the 1992 Presidential campaign to save jobs by selling F-16 fighters to Taiwan -- despite a pledge not to increase military sales to Taiwan.
In any case, it appears that despite grand claims made at the time, the series of Chinese-American agreements in the last few years has not resolved as much as both sides had hoped it would. In what was hailed as a landmark agreement last August, for example, Beijing agreed to let American diplomats inspect prisons in an effort to prevent prison-made goods from reaching the American market.
"It's been a complete flop," Mr. Munro of Asia Watch said of the agreement. "It's utterly toothless."
 
How Many Visits to Prisons?
 The United States Embassy declined to say how many visits had been made under the agreement. But the Chinese Foreign Ministry was more forthcoming. It said that it has allowed three visits to prisons.
"China has all along strictly observed the memorandum of understanding prohibiting trade in prison labor products," the Foreign Ministry said. "The Chinese side has made careful inspection of the relevant factories and found no case of exporting prison labor products to the United States."
In the first inspection, an American diplomat was allowed to visit part of the Gold Horse Diesel Engine Factory last fall in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming. The diplomat was allowed to see only a part of the factory, which is believed to be run by the Yunnan No. 1 Prison. The Chinese turned down requests to see other parts, and they have not yet permitted a return visit.
In Shanghai, the Chinese permitted a diplomatic visit last year -- before the agreement -- to the Laodong Machinery Factory, which was suspected of using prison labor. But after the visit, evidence emerged that the prison factory in fact was across the street from the site shown by the Chinese. Local officials have not allowed a visit by diplomats to that building.
 
Who Does the Interpreting?
 Still, diplomats say Beijing is not openly flouting the agreement and that cooperation has improved noticeably in the last couple of months. They say that China is simply taking advantage of ambiguities in the agreement and interpreting its obligations narrowly, the kinds of things that countries often do to protect their interests.
Another promise in dispute is China's pledge to Mr. Baker in 1991 to allow Chinese dissidents to leave the country if they are not the subject of legal proceedings. While Beijing has allowed many dissidents to leave, a handful, including Hou Xiaotian, Yu Haocheng and Li Honglin, have still been denied passports.
Among economic agreements, a landmark accord to open China's market to American goods has only been partly put into effect since it was signed in October, American officials say. Likewise, China agreed with the United States in 1989 not to launch international satellites at discount rates. An April report by the office of the United States Trade Representative said that China had been underbidding rivals and that "these low prices have called into question China's compliance with the 1989 agreement."
Carla A. Hills, the United States Trade Representative under President Bush, denied that China had a pattern of breaking its agreements. She noted, for example, that Beijing was generally credited with a solid effort to abide by a pact signed in January 1992 to protect intellectual property. "Every country will not have every date met precisely" in following through on agreements, she said. "But to suggest that there hasn't been dramatic progress is to misconstrue the story."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Home Depot's success has begun to attract naysayers.

BYLINE: By Robert Hurtado

 BODY:
TOUTED as the stock of the 1990's, Home Depot has rapidly climbed, but some professional investors now wonder if the stock has gotten ahead of itself.
The recent souring of retail stocks has had an impact on Home Depot, as investors tend to herd all retailers together when one falls out of favor. (In this case, that one is Wal-Mart.) But are there soft spots in this retail knight's armor? 
 The company has often been referred to as the Wal-Mart of the home improvement supply business and that comparison, until Wal-Mart's stock started falling, benefited Home Depot. The Atlanta company's string of 27 quarters of record profits, was certainly Wal-Mart-like. Perhaps because Home Depot has been so often compared to Wal-Mart, sobering views are emerging.
"Using any measure, Home Depot is pricey," says Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist of Gruntal & Company. "It is a stock that is trading at three times sales and has a price-to-earnings ratio of 38, based on 1993's anticipated profits. At no point in the 1980's did Wal-Mart ever trade at over one and a half times revenue." Home Depot's stock ended last week up 50 cents a share, to $44.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Last month The Wall Street Journal reported that in March the chairman of Home Depot, Bernard Marcus, sold 5 percent of his company stock, about 550,000 shares, for $35 million. At the time of the article, company officials said the sale did not reflect any concern that Home Depot shares were overpriced, stressing that the chairman still owned 15.1 million shares.
Some analysts have noted Home Depot's dependence on new capital to finance new stores. "Home Depot does not generate sufficient cash to reinvest in the business," Mr. Battipaglia said. "The momentum of growth has been fueled by issuance of high-priced equity. Which leads to another point, and that is the number of outstanding shares has been growing rapidly. This speaks to continuously tapping the financial markets to fund growth. Its illusion of growth reminds me of the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain. It's no miracle."
 The labor force in the hard-hit construction industry was easily tapped by the chain for employees to run its stores. But some professional investors are concerned that with the return of higher-paying construction jobs Home Depot may not be able to retain the experienced trades people who have provided the do-it-yourselfers with building tips and expert advice in making product selections. Michael Murphy, publisher of the Overpriced Stock Service in San Francisco, has maintained for a couple of years that Home Depot is expanding too fast.
"Home Depot has been doing three things that to me do not make sense," Mr. Murphy said. "The first is they are trying to continue to expand at a very rapid rate and it gets harder when you have that many stores. This used to be a fairly regional and tightly managed organization, which is now run to meet Wall Street's expectations."
Mr. Murphy also said that Home Depot opened stores near older stores and cannibalized the old stores' business. The company also opened stores near its toughest competitors, Builders Square, a division of Kmart, and Lowe's.
The stock is widely owned, with a high multiple of 53 times the last 12 months' earnings. "People who own high-priced shares have sky-high expectations, and when they get disappointing sales, the stocks get smashed," Mr. Murphy said. He did acknowledge, however, that as far as Home Depot is concerned, "so far I have been wrong."
James W. Schroeder, an equity analyst for MMS International, noted that store sales were down from historic levels. "Revenues per customer have also come down, but Home Depot is trying to offset the lower customer revenues by tighter controls on inventory, keeping down thefts and things of that nature," he said.
Management, Mr. Schroeder said, is sticking with the notion that it can hold to the course and to some extent is ignoring potential problems.
"If the economy comes back strong, it could cut into the do-it-yourself business, for the alternative could be to simply move to another house," Mr. Schroeder said.

HEADLINE: From Newsreels to Records: A New Home for Sony Music

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
While Sony USA has been conspicuously transforming the former A.T. & T. headquarters on the East Side of Manhattan into its new home, Sony Music has been quietly transforming the former Fox Movietone studios on the West Side into a new video and audio center.
The quiet ends today. 
 That is when the Sony Music Studios open in an industrial red-brick barn on 10th Avenue, between 53d and 54th Streets. Once the home of Fox Movietone newsreels, it was also where "Miracle on 34th Street," "On the Waterfront," "Fail Safe," "Shaft," "The Exorcist," "Sophie's Choice" and "Kramer vs. Kramer" were filmed, as well as television series like "I Spy" and "The Adams Chronicles."
At the heart of the complex, which Sony has completely rebuilt, to the tune of perhaps $40 million, is a 75-by-100-foot sound stage, with a 40-foot-high ceiling. This is where Sony will make many of the 220 music videos it produces every year.
Nearby are a smaller sound stage, a recording studio where 7 or 8 musicians can perform, 16 audio recording production rooms, 4 video editing rooms, a television control room, 2 rehearsal rooms, 4 songwriters' offices and an audio and video library and archive.
"Every phase that happens in the career of an artist can be handled and catered to," said Thomas D. Mottola, the president of Sony Music.
The studios will be available only to artists under contract to Sony, a roster that includes Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand.
Mr. Mottola would not disclose the cost of the project. He said it did not involve any economic incentives or tax abatements from New York City.
Mayor David N. Dinkins is scheduled to attend the opening tonight, when the main stage will resemble a West Side streetscape.
There are few traces of the past at the studios except for the sheer volume of the main stage itself, a handsomely paneled elevator cab and holes in the fourth-floor ceiling where chimneys used to extend from the nitrate-film storage vaults.
For 20 years, the studios were owned by Camera Mart, an equipment rental company, and leased to movie and television producers.
But Al Smith, a vice president of Sony Music, said: "It was getting to be a ghost of a building. There weren't many productions shot here." The last movie to be filmed there, he said, was "Billy Bathgate," released in 1991. Thirty-year-old equipment still filled the building after Sony acquired it, Mr. Smith said.
"If anything, we've built a more creative facility," he said. There will be about 80 full-time employees at the complex. When the studios and production rooms are booked up, there might be a few hundred people working there, Mr. Smith said.
Alan Suna, the chief executive officer of Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens, said he had received inquiries from producers who might have gone to the Camera Mart stages in previous years.
Of the Sony project, he said: "Our view is that the entertainment industry hasn't lost anything. In fact, it's a reopening, a rebirth of a facility."

HEADLINE: In Managed Competition, Insurance Agents at Risk

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
One part of the health insurance industry that could receive a body blow under managed competition is the nation's 250,000 agents and brokers.
Today, they act as intermediaries between the employers and individuals who buy health insurance and the companies that sell it. But if the new health alliances can bargain on behalf of most consumers and gather information from insurers, consumers should be able to make choices on their own, theorists of managed competition say. 
 David E. Hebert, counsel to the Association of Health Insurance Agents in Washington, said that if the President's health-care proposal required most consumers to buy their insurance exclusively through the health alliances, many, if not a majority, of health insurance agents could be unemployed. The Administration should plan for such dislocations, he said, just as the Defense Department must consider the loss of jobs from arms industry cutbacks.
Anxiety about that prospect is particularly pointed at small businesses like that of Joel A. Shapiro, whose firm, Bartmon, Shapiro & Associates on West 57th Street in Manhattan, sells life and health insurance. Mr. Shapiro, who over the last 20 years has built up a business with nearly $1 million a year in revenues, employs 10 people and does business from airy offices that afford a majestic view of Central Park.
Mr. Shapiro said that if the description of health-care change that he has read is adopted, he would be forced to drop half his workers.
"I have been having trouble sleeping lately," Mr. Shapiro said. "I imagine it will be like watching them cut the heart out of a person."

Troubled New York City And a Note of Optimism

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
IN 1987, a stubbornly optimistic mayoral commission issued its forecast for the millennium under a title that evoked high hopes: "New York Ascendant." Less than four months later, the stock market crashed.
With the millennium now six years closer, another city commission has just published its own generally rosy vision of the future, but with a decidedly more sober name. "Shaping the City's Future" is the less judgmental title of the New York City Planning Commission's first strategic agenda, as required by the revised City Charter. The commission's report on planning and zoning doubles as a broadly delineated gauge against which the courage and the imagination of municipal candidates can be measured. 
 First, the report provides thought-provoking perspective: in 1989, the rate of housing construction hit a 13-year high; the quality of waterways surrounding the city in 1990 was the highest recorded since monitoring began in 1909.
Since 1960, the city lost more than two-thirds of its factory workers; more than 1 in 4 of the 3.3 million people employed in the city work for government or in the fields of health, education and social services; nearly half of the city's households have access to a car -- up 28 percent since 1980. Women make up 47 percent of the city's labor force (and, among those working women, 12 percent have children younger than age 6); median household income, adjusted for inflation, declined in only three of the city's community districts during the 1980's -- all of them in the South Bronx; while the poverty rate declined slightly between 1979 and 1989, the number of poor working-age adults rose; 47 percent of households spend more than 30 percent of their monthly income in rent.
Also, the ratio between the number of New Yorkers who are college graduates and the number of higher-skilled jobs reversed over the last two decades: in 1970, city residents held 200,000 more management and professional jobs than college degrees; in 1990, the number of New Yorkers with college degrees surpassed the number of employed managers and professionals by 125,000.
Those figures may suggest a statistical portrait of Dorian Gray in reverse. New York's inanimate stone and glass skyscape is frequently renewed while its flesh-and-blood inhabitants seem to age somewhat less gracefully. But the real picture is more complex. For example, immigrants represent a vital influx of raw material with which the city can, once again, re-invent itself.
The stock market crashed in 1987. The city did not. But New York's resiliency is again facing a profound test. This year's mayoral campaign is a good time to confront the questions and demand answers. The City Planning Commission's "discussion document," often vaguely but sometimes boldly, provides grist for both.
It recommends a major overhaul of the zoning guidelines that have governed development for three decades -- though not scrapping them altogether because that would be too time-consuming and politically wrenching.
Among the proposed changes: recycle older Manhattan office buildings for housing; allow bakeries, electronics assemblers and other light industry on local commercial streets; let supermarkets and large retail stores open in underused industrial zones and permit housing in industrial sections of the West Side and of downtown Flushing, and re-evaluate liberal rules that routinely allow health, education and child-care centers in residential and commercial neighborhoods since their missions have expanded markedly.
Employment in export industries that provide service and information to the nation and to the world exceeds the number of jobs in local-market industries. Commercial transportation used to flow west from the city, sending goods to the rest of the country. Now it generally comes east, delivering goods to New York City, the nation's largest market, and to Long Island, the ninth largest.
The report proposes concentrating more suburban jobs in compact centers and improving mass transportation to those centers. That might discourage even more automobile traffic and accommodate New York City residents who work in the suburbs -- a category that grew by one-third during the last decade.
It also proposes discouraging entry of private cars into Manhattan south of 60th Street by imposing tolls, at least during certain times of day, on all bridges and tunnels or requiring special permits for vehicles entering Manhattan; reviving the Second Avenue Subway (one mile of tunnel and three stations were built and abandoned); extending the Flushing Line to New Jersey; building an express bus terminal in lower Manhattan; allowing commercial vans on the Belt and Grand Central Parkways; constructing a twin span at the Goethals Bridge on Staten Island; widening the Van Wyck Expressway, and reviewing the limits that had been imposed on new parking lots and garages in Manhattan because automobile use has increased regardless.
"Perhaps unreasonable public confidence in a better future has been replaced by an often unjustified sense of gloom," the City Planning Commission says, comparing its vision with the one advanced in 1987 by the Commission on the Year 2000. Or, as Dr. Seuss might have said of grown-up city like New York:
You're in pretty good shape . . .
For the shape that you're in.

HEADLINE: THE WHITE HOUSE STRUGGLES TO SAVE ENERGY TAX PLAN

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has altered major facets of its proposed energy tax in response to political pressures and is now struggling to rescue the tax against a horde of lobbyists straining to pick it apart.
Some of Washington's most potent industry groups -- the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute and the American Farm Bureau -- have vowed to kill the tax altogether, while dozens of other lobbies are mounting a major effort to amend the Administration's proposals. 
 Although some lobbyists say they have a good chance to kill the tax outright, Administration officials and many members of Congress predict it will survive -- even if substantially reworked.
 
 
Broad-Based Tax
 It should be no surprise that the energy tax faces so much opposition: it is a new type of tax, it would touch all Americans and industries, and it would raise a lot of money. The tax -- based on the heat content of fuels as measured in B.T.U.'s, or British thermal units -- would cost a family of four earning $40,000 about $200 a year, according to Administration officials.
Aluminum producers want an exemption from paying the tax on the huge amounts of electricity they use, the trucking industry wants its diesel fuel exempted and farmers are resisting a tax on the fuel they use.
"There's a lot of grass-roots lobbying about this because it touches so many people," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which acts on tax legislation. "I would expect more changes in it because it has so many moving parts."
 
 
Political Heat
 Lobbying groups have been emboldened to seek changes in the proposal -- the most significant new tax in the President's economic package -- because the Administration has already made so many major concessions on the tax in response to searing political heat. Since President Clinton proposed the tax on Feb. 17, it has probably been altered more than any of his other tax proposals.
Originally, the White House had hoped to generate $22 billion from the energy tax. Administration officials say that the exemptions already agreed to would reduce the tax revenue by a few hundred million dollars, although some environmentalists say the revenue erosion is much more than that.
As a result of farm state lobbying, the Administration now proposes to exempt ethanol, a fuel made from corn. Responding to steel industry pressures, the Administration has proposed exempting coal used for making steel. And to protect domestic airlines from foreign competition, the Administration has bowed to industry pleas to exempt fuel used for international flights. Seeing all these concessions, other industries are shouting "me, too!"
If the lobbyists succeed in truncating or killing the tax, it would be a major setback for the Administration, which has already seen the Senate block its stimulus package, and which appears to face almost certain defeat on its plan for an investment tax credit.
The President embraced the energy tax -- which would add 5 to 10 percent to the price of oil, gas and electricity -- because it is expected to encourage conservation and reduce pollution. But any environmental benefits from the tax seem largely forgotten as lobbyists line up to eviscerate it.
"The energy tax is important to help us get the deficit down," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.
The tax could face its biggest test in the Senate Finance Committee, where the Democrats, many from oil or farm states, have an 11-to-9 edge. That means the Administration may be forced to make concessions to individual Democratic senators to keep them on board.
 
 
Impact in North Dakota
 Take Kent Conrad, a committee Democrat from North Dakota. He points to studies showing that the tax would cost $1,200 a year for a typical North Dakota farm family, whose income averages $17,600.
"My view of the B.T.U. tax is we're better off without it," he said. "In terms of my constituency, it hits agriculture very hard. I can foresee a possibility where I'd vote for it, but that would be assuming it included broad exemptions for agriculture."
Senator Conrad merely wants what many of his colleagues have already won. Responding to pressures from Senator Moynihan, from the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, and from others, the Administration has exempted home heating oil from the proposal to tax oil products at a higher rate than coal or natural gas, a provision intended to reduce the nation's dependence on oil imports. Many homes in the Northeast are heated by oil.
 
 
Changes Cited
 Secretary Bentsen described at a recent Senate Finance Committee hearing how the Administration had changed its energy tax proposals. He noted that the Administration moved to exempt ethanol after Senators Conrad and Thomas A. Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, voiced their concerns. Then he noted that Democratic Senators John Breaux of Louisiana and David Boren of Oklahoma were unhappy with a proposal to tax natural gas at the wellhead. Gas companies feared that fixed-price contracts might prevent them from passing on the cost, so the Treasury proposed that the tax be collected once the gas leaves the pipeline.
Similarly, coal was originally to be taxed at the mine, but many mining companies complained that it would be hard to measure the B.T.U. content of their coal and hard to pass the cost of the tax through because of fixed-price contracts. Now the Administration proposes that the tax be collected from utilities and industries that use coal.
Environmentalists and electrical utilities are at loggerheads over the industry's effort to move the collection point from the utility, as the Administration has proposed, to the consumer.
 
 
Not Eager for Hearings
 Electric companies are concerned that if the tax is collected from utilities, they might need to go through regulatory hearings before passing the tax onto consumers. Utilities are not eager for such hearings, fearing that rate commissions might seize the opportunity to push electric prices down, because lower interest rates have cut the capital costs of many utilities.
Environmentalists say it is important to keep utilities as the collection point because that will increase their incentive to use cleaner, more efficient fuels. Environmentalists fear that the House Ways and Means Committee will approve the utility-backed proposal -- unless the Administrations fights hard against it -- because several committee members are close to their local utilities.
Another big fight involves the aluminum industry, which is intensely jealous that the steel industry has won an exemption for its coal. Aluminum producers have mounted perhaps the largest pressure campaign in the hope of exempting the electricity they use. Turning ore into pure aluminum requires great amounts of electricity, and industry lobbyists say the tax will cost aluminum makers $170 million a year.
Coal and coke used to make steel are exempted because some carbon from these fuels goes into the steel itself. They are thus considered feedstocks, rather than fuels. Similarly, petroleum products that go into plastics are exempt, while those used for fuel are not.
Representative Michael Kopetski, an Oregon Democrat, is pressing the Administration to exempt the aluminum industry's electricity from the tax, saying it could drive two Oregon aluminum plants out of business, costing the state more than 1,500 jobs.
 In a recent hearing, Secretary Bentsen was hanging tough -- and sounded surprisingly like a chemistry professor in explaining why electricity used to make aluminum was not a feedstock and did not deserve an exemption.
"In making petrochemicals, the atoms of the feedstock hydrocarbons become the atoms of the polymers and other products," he said. Contrary to claims advanced by aluminum industry officials, he said, "electricity does not contribute net electrons of the reaction; it contributes the energy that causes the chemical reaction to occur."

HEADLINE: Higher Salaries for Teachers?

 BODY:
Encouraged by state fact-finders who recommended that the New York City teachers' union get slightly higher salary increases than most other city unions, the teachers want more than slightly more. Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, points to ambiguous language in the fact-finders' report that suggests her union should get an 8.5 percent increase over 39 months -- instead of the 8.25 percent other unions got -- plus "an appropriate payment of additional money as may be made available" by the state.
The 8.5 percent is defensible; the city has traditionally paid teachers a bit more than other municipal workers in recognition of their role in educating the next generation. But the city's finances aren't strong enough to justify an even larger increase just now. 
 While Albany gave the city an additional $145 million in education aid this year, it didn't earmark that money for teachers' salaries. The Legislature allocated $27 million for building new schools, $18 million for school grants, and the remaining $100 million for operating aid, which the Board of Education wants to use to plug harmful holes in its budget.
Why not give the teachers part of the $100 million? The idea is tempting. But the city is still suffering from an economic slide; indeed, the Mayor's proposed budget cuts $150 million from the school system. But though there is clearly little money for additional raises, Ms. Feldman argues that New York City schoolteachers earn 23 percent less than those in surrounding communities; that teachers lured by those higher salaries are leaving, and that low salaries are hurting recruitment and forcing the hiring of uncertified teachers. Those arguments are unpersuasive.
Although city teachers earn less than those in the suburbs, they earn more than those in other large cities. School officials say they hire uncertified teachers largely because of a teacher shortage in specialized areas. And there is evidence that most teachers who quit aren't going to the suburbs, where, in fact, there aren't that many jobs.
Many teachers leave to go into other professions, or because of poor conditions in the city schools. Teachers do not want to work in decrepit, unsafe schools, teaching overcrowded classes. Spending money to improve those conditions might well encourage more teachers to stay in the system than would a slightly higher salary.
If teachers want raises higher than the 8.5 percent recommended by the fact-finders, they can earn them by giving up some benefits. For instance, if they gave up paid sabbaticals, worked longer days and agreed to cover occasionally for absent teachers without additional compensation, the money saved could go to higher salaries.
With a limited amount of money to spend, the city must make difficult choices. The schools come first, teachers' salaries second.

HEADLINE: U.S. Intervention in Bosnia Has Only Negatives;
Moral Leadership Calls

 BODY:
To the Editor:
My former professor Zbigniew Brzezinski speaks eloquently to what millions of my generation must be thinking (" 'Never Again' -- Except for Bosnia," Op-Ed, April 22). Those of us born after World War II grew up in a near-barrage of accounts of the horrors of Hitler's Nazis and the Holocaust. Reminders were deemed necessary if the world was to insure such horrors never occurred again. 
 Like Mr. Brzezinski, I have noted the dark irony on recent front pages: reports of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum printed alongside coverage of the carnage in Bosnia.
The lesson of the Holocaust is that our "national interest" must encompass something beyond economic or political concerns. We are a nation of human beings, and the brutality in Bosnia represents a fundamental threat to people everywhere. As former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain noted last week, even if it could be argued that Bosnia is not in our sphere of interest, it must be in our sphere of conscience.
That it would be appropriate for Europe to intervene in Bosnia is without question. But Europe has proved that a truly united European Community is a pipe dream.
The credibility and legitimacy of America's influence in the world derives not just from its ability but from its willingness. The United States must act because no one else will. Extraordinary responsibilities, as well as privileges, attend our country's status as world leader.
If we don't respond, convincing ourselves that the risks are too high, the time isn't right or that acting is not in our interest, what will become of our moral leadership in the world? And what will the Holocaust museum be but a monument to our self-righteousness?

HEADLINE: What Are We Going To Do About Crime?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Even more important than health care reform is the issue of crime in this once great country. It is absolutely urgent that politicians face this issue immediately. Crime is causing the financial destruction of the inner cities of the United States. 
 I own a large industrial complex in the East Williamsburg section of Brooklyn; the area's high crime rate makes leasing industrial space to businesses impossible. We are constantly harassed by hookers, drug addicts and the common thief.
Just last week the siamese pipe that is necessary for the fire department to operate our sprinkler system was stolen. It was stolen because it was made of brass and is easily resalable by a drug addict. Because of the configuration of the building it is impossible to hide the pipe. I fully expect that within 30 days this $800 brass pipe will again be stolen.
It is unreasonable to expect new businesses to want to come into the inner cities because of the high crime rate. It does not matter that inner-city rents are so low businesses could probably operate profitablely even during these difficult economic times. Businesses cannot get employees to come to work in the inner cities. So, what are we going to do about the crime issue?

HEADLINE: China Now the Big Spender on Gold

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
China has become the largest buyer of gold, ending the United States' 25-year reign and giving gold's price a buoyancy it has not had in a decade.
Last year, the Chinese bought more than 350 metric tons of gold, much of it in the form of chuk kam, or pure gold jewelry, according to the annual report on the gold market by Gold Fields Mineral Services of London. Its figures are the most closely watched in the market, and this year provided some of the first concrete data on Chinese gold purchases. 
 Philip Klapwijk, an author of the report, said the Chinese buying did not outstrip that of the United States by much, but he could not provide comparable figures because Gold Fields has not completed its consumption analyses for 1992. Total world demand last year was 3,480 metric tons, up 12 percent.
 
Abundantly Disposable Income
 There have been several spurs to China's buying. With the expansion of the economy, the Chinese now have more cash, but relatively few outlets for spending it. The threat of Chinese inflation -- gold is a classic inflation hedge -- and a drop in the value of the Chinese currency, the yuan, added to the buying, according to Gold Fields.
Speculation about Chinese buying has helped the price of gold rally. Since March, its price has jumped 9.6 percent, to a nine-month high of $358.30 last week, from an eight-year low of $326.90. The price of gold on the Commodity Exchange here in New York closed yesterday at $357.20 an ounce, down 20 cents.
The potential for continued buying in China has produced predictions of further increases from gold analysts. When these analysts gather now, their talk turns to how China, the world's most populous nation, could be the consumer of millions and millions of ounces of gold as its economy opens and develops. By contrast, the United States market is a mature one, where fewer of the traditional reasons for buying gold apply.
 
Balance to Other Selling
 China's buying has spurred prices another way. The Government there, according to the report, appears to have purchased a large portion of the 12.9 million ounces of gold sold by the Dutch central bank at the end of 1992. In a year when total central bank net sales were the largest since 1968, this buying helped relieve some of the downward pressure on prices, which fell 5 percent in 1992.
Also keeping prices from dropping further was the strong worldwide demand for gold jewelry, which rose 329 metric tons last year, the third-largest increase in 25 years.
The data on Chinese buying are still secret, and Government figures do not disclose very much. But the authors of the study say that the estimate of Chinese purchases, at more than 350 metric tons, is a conservative figure.
By comparison, in 1991, the latest such data available in detail, the United States accounted for 259 tons, and India, which was No. 2, 207 tons. Italy, the largest maker of jewelry by a wide margin, was the No. 3 gold consumer, with a total just over 165 tons. This includes jewelry, bars and coins.
China's movement to the top of the list reflects in part an effort to integrate the gold production and consumption of Communist countries, and formerly Communist ones like the old Soviet Union, into the global data that Gold Fields has been collecting and analyzing for 25 years.
At the same time, the distribution of these figures helps lift the price of gold by increasing expectations that the bottom of the decade-old bear market may have been reached. The supply and demand forces that have brought gold prices down may now be reversing themselves, according to the data.
 
 
Much Greater Demand
 Such a possible shift is evident from the global figures that include the Communist and formerly Communist countries. According to this data, the gap between fundamental supply, which includes mine production and gold scrap, and fundamental demand -- fabrication and bar-hoarding -- is widening. In 1990, basic demand outpaced basic supply by 187 tons. By the end of 1992, this had greatly widened, to 725 tons.
"The underlying supply-and-demand fundamentals are becoming more positive," said Mr. Klapwijk, who is a senior metals analyst at Gold Fields.
Early this year the price of gold failed to rally, and the fact that it did not, despite the improving fundamentals, shows the effect that swing factors, in this case central bank selling, can have. Last year, net gold sales of central banks reached 599 metric tons. The threat of more sales this year helped keep a lid on the price early in 1993.
 
Cyclical Performance
 In an interview here before the formal presentation of the Gold Fields report yesterday, Mr. Klapwijk would not predict what would happen with central bank gold sales for all of 1993. But in the past, large net selling in one year has been followed by little or no selling the next.
What this means for the price of gold is hard to predict, according to Mr. Klapwijk, who acknowledged that the Gold Fields report has a more optimistic tone than others in the last several years.
China's buying could slacken if its Government decides to fight rising inflation with an austerity program, as occurred in 1988. And central banks could keep on selling. But if the supply-and-demand fundamentals hold out in favor of gold, prices of $380 an ounce by the end of the year have a better base of support than in past years.

HEADLINE: Jackson Heights Streets Familiar to Drug Cartels

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
Colombia is a continent away from Queens, but Carlos Zamora felt no surprise yesterday when he heard that leaders of the Cali cocaine cartel had been accused of killing his friend, Manuel de Dios Unanue. Seated three barstools from where Mr. de Dios was shot to death, Mr. Zamora sadly stated the obvious: the cartel is a strong and brutal presence in Jackson Heights.
"These people got no brains," said Mr. Zamora, a 50-year-old insurance agent, as he sipped white wine in the Meson Asturias restaurant where Mr. de Dios died with two bullets to his head in March 1992. "They just kill whoever they think they've got to kill." 
 Law-enforcement officials say Jackson Heights and Elmhurst are the center of cocaine importation and distribution for the northeastern United States. But the tightly structured drug organizations operate well out of view; street crime is not high, because there is no big money in muggings.
This is the world that Mr. de Dios chronicled in El Diario-La Prensa and in his own crime magazines, and it is the world that killed him, the authorities say.
 
Laundering Drug Profits
 Hundreds of millions, maybe billions of dollars in cash and cocaine flow in and around Jackson Heights, according to state and Federal law-enforcement officials. Along Roosevelt Avenue, a small but visible service economy bubbles amid travel agencies and check-cashers that, while seemingly unremarkable, are believed to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of drug profits each year.
Neighborhood advocates complain that the Cali cartel, and to a lesser degree the Medellin cartel, casts an unfair shadow on most of the 30,000 Colombian immigrants there. But law-enforcement officials say that is why the cartels chose Jackson Heights, because the dealers can blend into the vibrant, diverse and rapidly changing neighborhood.
"This is their base of operations -- this is the sea they can swim in," Thomas F. Sheehan, a Federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent, said in a recent interview before two people were indicted in Mr. de Dios's death. "They are not immigrants. They are here to plunder."
 
Business and Crime
 Colombians are the largest Hispanic group in Queens, according to the city Planning Department. Most of the immigrants are legitimate workers or entrepreneurs who opened restaurants, clothing stores and real estate agencies.
But when cocaine came in vogue in the early 1980's, many other businesses opened that the authorities say are less innocuous. These enterprises fascinated Mr. de Dios as he wrote about the connection between crime and legitimate business.
"He had many friends and many enemies," said Nestor Campas, a 56-year-old Colombian who owns a clothing store next to the brick office building on 79th Street off Roosevelt Avenue where Mr. de Dios based his crime magazines.
The cartels themselves are elusive organizations in which members are strung through the city, moving and guarding cash and cocaine in so-called "stash houses" and "safe houses." Over the last few years, the authorities have made scores of raids, which they say have resulted in the movement of some high-level drug activity from Jackson Heights to quieter places like Long Island.
In 1991, the New York Drug Enforcement Task Force, made up of Federal, state and local authorities, arrested 38 members of a Cali cartel group in New York City. Many had ties to Jackson Heights, the authorities said.
 
'One-Stop Shopping'
 Although cartel members themselves -- and their bases of operation -- shift constantly, the authorities say that the cartel presence is clear in Jackson Heights because of the businesses that have sprung up to support them.
There are now some 200 travel agencies, check-cashers and international telephone services, many of which the authorities say launder hundreds of millions of dollars to South America and Europe. No one knows the exact numbers, but the Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 90 percent of its money laundering cases in the New York area trace back to Jackson Heights.
And there is even what might be called "one-stop shopping" for high-level drug dealers: In 1991, the owners of a real estate office on Roosevelt Avenue were arrested after the authorities said they rented beepers, cellular phones and apartments for members of a cartel, and even arranged to handle their bills and rent payments.
"All these places, the majority of them, launder money," Ivan A. Hoyos, a 26-year-old telephone worker, said yesterday, echoing a common belief in the neighborhood and among law-enforcement officials. Referring to Mr. de Dios, he said, "He dealt with all of them."
Mr. de Dios's involvement in the neighborhood, exploring the cartels and their business relationships, ran so deep that many felt his death was almost inevitable, if not by the hands of the cartels then by someone else.
"Everybody was expecting this because of his books and his magazines," said Francisco Talamonte, a 31-year-old restaurant worker, as he sat in a small trash-strewn park off Roosevelt Avenue now named Manuel de Dios Unanue Triangle. "Everybody would say, 'One of these days, they are going to kill him.' "

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Figures Revised Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Consumers increased their debts by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.5 percent in March and borrowed much more during previous months than had been estimated earlier, the Federal Reserve Board said today.
Consumer installment credit grew by $3.44 billion, to $752.2 billion, in March, according to the Fed's report. It was the eighth straight monthly increase. 
 The Fed also said that consumer credit rose a sharply revised 7.4 percent in February, rather than 1.9 percent as estimated earlier, and 5.0 percent in January, rather than 1.6 percent.
The consumer-credit report contained revisions going back to January 1989, including more up-to-date data and newly calculations of seasonal factors.
Before the release of today's figures, the Fed had reported that consumers resumed borrowing after the recession, when many had reduced their debts though at a slow pace.
Consumer-installment credit includes all household debt not secured by real estate; it does not include home-equity loans or mortgages.
 
Hint of Spending Patterns
 Consumer-credit figures can be an indication of consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
In today's consumer-credit data, a lack of growth in personal income was apparent in the use of revolving credit. It increased 9 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate after shooting up a revised 13.8 percent in February and 10.1 percent in January. The Fed had said earlier that the increase was 11.4 percent in February and 7.3 percent in January.
But the rise in automobile credit slowed to 1.4 percent in March from a revised 11.5 percent surge a month earlier. The original February estimate had been a gain of 4.8 percent. Auto loans dropped 5.4 percent in January.
Other kinds of consumer credit rose 6.2 percent after falling a revised 4.5 percent in February, less than the 12.6 percent decline in last month's estimate. This category -- which includes loans for education, vacations, boats and mobile homes -- had increased 11.3 percent in January.

HEADLINE: Though Still in Effect, Arabs' Economic Boycott of Israel Weakens

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 10

 BODY:
Step by step, Government officials and business leaders here say, the decades-old Arab economic boycott of Israel has weakened to a point that many international companies now believe they can safely ignore it.
But the officials caution that while down, the boycott is far from out, and that it continues to scare away foreign businesses skittish about offending Arab countries, especially the oil-producing nations of the Persian Gulf. 
 Israelis were heartened by recent news reports that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had told the United States that as partial repayment for the American rescue in the Persian Gulf war they would stop two forms of the blacklist: a secondary boycott affecting American companies that trade with Israel and a tertiary boycott of concerns doing business with the blacklisted companies.
 
Primary Boycott Remains
 No change was announced in the primary boycott, which prohibits Arab countries and companies from commercial dealings with Israelis and which was created by the newly formed Arab League in 1946, two years before the state of Israel was. Egypt, headquarters of the Arab League, dropped its own boycott laws after signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, although trade between the countries remains small.
Among other encouraging signs for Israelis were new antiboycott regulations that went into effect last week in Germany. More than a week ago, on the heels of a Japanese Government denunciation of the boycott, the heads of major Japanese trading companies came to Israel. While the visit produced no new contracts, the mere fact that it had taken place was considered significant, given Japan's faithful adherence to the boycott over the years.
Beyond that, Israeli officials and American Jewish groups are looking to the Clinton Administration to exert new vigor in efforts to kill the boycott once and for all.
Although American companies have been prohibited for 16 years by Federal law from observing the Arab blacklist, enforcement has often been spotty. That was underlined in late March when Baxter International Inc., the world's largest medical supplies concern, agreed to pay civil and criminal fines of $6.5 million for having tried to get around the antiboycott law.
 
The Largest Penalties
 The penalties against the Chicago-based company were by far the largest imposed under the statute. While some experts viewed the action as a sign that the new Administration might prove to be tougher on this score than its predecessors, others argued that the case had shown that even big companies could still be cowed into going along with blacklist rules.
Still, many Israelis say that momentum is now with them.
"I believe that the Arab boycott is on a losing trend," said Micha Harish, the Minister of Industry and Trade. Dan Gillerman, president of the Federation of Israel Chambers of Commerce, says that many companies -- including giants like Coca-Cola, I.B.M., Hilton Hotels and Toyota -- have discovered that they can set up shop in Israel without harming their interests in the Arab world.
"In many cases, the fear of the boycott turned out to be stronger than the boycott itself," Mr. Gillerman said. "Companies that never spoke to us, that would never answer an Israeli fax, are now coming here."
His organization estimates that the blacklist has reduced Israeli exports and foreign investment in Israel by 10 percent a year. "At the end of the day, I don't think Israel was devastated," he said. Nonetheless, the federation calculates that at that annual percentage, the country has lost more than $40 billion in exports and investments over the last 45 years.
Even in the recently improved climate, thousands of companies remain on the blacklist kept by the Damascus-based Central Office for the Boycott of Israel; they include hundreds of companies added in the last few years. And while Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have signaled that they are ready to ease up on American companies, they have made no such gesture toward Europeans and Asians.
In fact, several European companies were recently added to the roster, including CSA, the national airline of the Czech Republic. The carrier had been "transporting Jewish settlers to Palestine," an official in Damascus said.
Japanese businesses say that they, too, still feel Arab pressure even though their Government has begun calling for an end to the boycott and major auto companies like Toyota and Honda, once reluctant, have entered the Israeli market. Masaya Miyoshi, president of the Keidanren, the dominant Japanese business organization, said in Jerusalem recently that it could take years before large numbers of Japanese felt confident enough in this region's stability to tell the Arabs no.
Harry Wall, head of the Israel office of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said that unless the gulf countries declared unambiguously that the rules had changed, many small companies would continue to feel intimidated.
"The atmosphere is better, and the Middle East peace process has definitely had an impact," Mr. Wall said. "But until the Arab leadership stands up and says that in the spirit of the peace process we're dropping the blacklist, I can't say there's been progress."

HEADLINE: ECOLOGIST NAMED FOR A U.N. AGENCY

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 10

 BODY:
In a move seen as likely to rankle many third-world governments, President Clinton has nominated a specialist on the environment as the new administrator of the United Nations Development Program.
The nominee, James Gustave Speth, is president of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research center in Washington. Clinton Administration officials confirmed today that he had been nominated to succeed William H. Draper 3d, who said last week that he would step down on July 15. Mr. Draper has been administrator since 1986, and his second four-year term was scheduled to end next year. 
 The Development Program administers and coordinates most of the United Nations' technical assistance programs around the world. They include programs in economic development, health, education, environmental protection and the status of women. Under Mr. Draper, the agency's programs grew in value from $890 million in 1985 to $1.5 billion in 1992. Traditionally, the agency's administrator has been an American.
 
Priorities Criticized
 Mr. Draper, a former president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank, was seen as favoring economic development over environmental concerns, a reputation he and his supporters contest.
Mr. Speth, a professor of law at Georgetown University, is a former chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and he served on a White House strategy commission on dealing with toxic substances, in the Carter Administration. He was also a member of President Clinton's transition team dealing with natural resources.
Delegates here from some developing nations were said to be less than enthusiastic about Mr. Speth because of his background in environmental issues. In the third world, development and environmental protection are often seen as incompatible.
Mr. Speth was a major contributor to "Global Biodiversity Strategy," a blueprint for the Earth Summit, the United Nations-sponsored international ecological conference held in Rio de Janeiro last June.
The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is said to be ready to endorse Mr. Speth next month and to present his name to the General Assembly for formal approval. Under United Nations rules, he selects a candidate with the advice of the Development Program's governing council, a 48-nation body, which traditionally accepts the recommendation of the United States Government.

HEADLINE: A War on Global Corruption

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 10

 BODY:
Alarmed by a sharp increase in bribery over the last decade, a group of senior government, business and development-agency officials met here recently to establish a coalition against corruption in global business transactions.
The coalition, called Transparency International, is being modeled on Amnesty International, the human rights advocacy group. It will concentrate on battling what officials termed "grand corruption" in development programs and trade. 
 About 70 executives, aid experts and senior government officials attended the inaugural sessions here, including Robert S. McNamara, the former World Bank president and American Secretary of Defense. Its 30-member advisory council includes Oscar Arias Sanchez, Nobel laureate and former President of Costa Rica, and Andrew Young, chief American delegate to the United Nations in the late 70's. Initial financing is being provided by the German Foundation for International Development.
The experts said that corruption in international aid and commerce had risen sharply, with the average rates for bribes paid to acquire large contracts in developing countries rising in the 1980's from about 5 percent of a deal's total value to about 15 percent.
Anti-corruption measures like international competitive bidding or pre-shipment inspection of goods are, at the same time, being increasingly circumvented by tacit agreement of buyers and sellers, the coalition said.

HEADLINE: Trade-Pact Opposition Eases a Bit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
After intense pressure from the White House, some leading Congressional critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement are toning down their oratory. A few of them are even saying they might support the pact after all.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said in an interview late today that he was urging Democrats to avoid taking positions now on the pact, which would eliminate trade barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States. He said lawmakers should give the Clinton Administration time to complete its negotiations with Canada and Mexico on three side agreements. 
 The side agreements will cover labor and environmental issues and the surges of imports that might follow the lowering of tariffs. They are scheduled to be completed by mid-July. The Clinton Administration is counting on concessions in the side agreements to win over some Democratic opponents of the pact.
 
Looking for 'Real Teeth'
 Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, said the free-trade pact could pass Congress if the side agreements have "real teeth," as the Administration has promised. He described the pact itself as "a reasonable and good thing for the United States, Mexico and Canada to do."
Mr. Gephardt is scheduled to give his views on trade in greater detail in a speech here on Tuesday sponsored by the Economic Strategy Institute, a research group that has been critical of the pact.
Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has long been one of the most visible and influential Congressional critics of free trade, sent his colleagues a letter on Friday urging them not to take any position on the pact until the Administration concludes negotiations on the side agreements.
 
Possible Conditional Support
 Mr. Levin said in an interview today that he might support the pact if those agreements included a long list of changes intended to provide additional protections for American workers against lower-wage competition from Mexico.
The new stances by two of the best-known Congressional critics of free trade upset some members of Congress who remain opposed to the agreement. "I don't think this is the time for us to let the debate wallow; it's time for us to sharpen the debate," said Representative Marcy Kaptur, a six-term Ohio Democrat. "We can't be back-benchers on this one."
Representative Sherrod Brown, a freshman Ohio Democrat who has organized freshman opposition to the pact, said, "It seems to me now is the time to really scuttle the agreement."
President George Bush signed the agreement on Dec. 17, but it can go into force only if a simple majority of each house of Congress votes for legislation putting its provisions into law. Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said last week that the Administration planned to introduce this legislation at the beginning or end of August, so that it could be passed before Congress adjourned for the year. The agreement is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1.
 
Intense Lobbying
 In interviews today, lawmakers gave several reasons for the pact's brightening prospects and the new reluctance of leading Democrats to criticize it. One reason is an Administration lobbying blitz after Leon Panetta, the budget director, said three weeks ago that the pact did not have enough votes to pass in its current form. Another is a compromise struck by six environmental groups 11 days ago to support the pact if a side agreement on the environment included certain provisions. If there was solidarity against the pact by the environmental movement and labor, Congressional approval would be difficult, said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who heads a Congressional group of the pact's backers.
A third reason is a decision by the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council last week to continue pressing for broad side agreements and changes in the basic pact. Some union leaders have been calling for a national campaign to kill the agreement, but they were turned back by the national leadership, said Democrats with close ties to organized labor.
 
'Common Sense' Cited
 The council's decision "has some impact," Mr. Levin said. "In a sense, it's common sense: first decide what's in it."
Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who has led support for the pact, said that among members of Congress, "There is a shift, and I trace it back to the Panetta comments, which really shook up the White House."
On Thursday, President Clinton strongly urged Congressional approval of the pact, while Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has defied opposition from organized labor to give two speeches in the last two weeks in favor of the agreement.
Administration lobbying has focused on the House, in which Democrats hold a larger majority, because purely local concerns about trade tend to be more pronounced and organized labor tends to have more influence there. Lawmakers and Administration officials say the agreement is more popular in the Senate.
 
Concern About Bureaucracy
 House and Senate Republicans have warned the Administration against pursuing ambitious side agreements of the sort sought by Mr. Levin and Mr. Gephardt. They contend that the North American labor and environmental commissions now being negotiated could turn into new bureaucracies on labor and environmental issues.
House and Senate Republican leaders have warned the Administration that it risks losing their support if the side agreements go too far.
The Administration lobbying effort has been unusually pugnacious. For example, it has included publicly and private appeals to anti-Japanese sentiment in Congress, something that the Bush Administration tried to avoid.
"If we fail to approve the Nafta, we won't get its benefits," Mr. Kantor told the Senate Commerce Committee last week. "In fact, it could go backward, and frankly, open up opportunities for the Japanese or other countries to come in and take advantage of what we will not take advantage of."

Castro Sofa Concern Sold By Family

BYLINE: New York Times Regional Newspapers

 BODY:
The Castro Convertibles Corporation of New Hyde Park, L.I., a family-owned company started in 1931 by Bernard and Teresa Castro, has been bought by Krause's Sofa Factory of Brea, Calif. Terms were not disclosed.
Michael W. Gibbons, the president and chief executive of Krause's, a unit of the Worth Corporation, said yesterday that his company had bought Castro's Long Island manufacturing plant, 18 Castro showrooms throughout the East Coast and the Castro corporate name and patents. The New Hyde Park plant, which employs more than 50 people, will close by summer, according to Krause's officials. 
 Mr. Gibbons said Krause's may some day open a new plant on the East Coast to serve a planned expansion of up to 100 stores under the Castro name. He said no specific sites had been considered for the plant, but he did not rule out reopening in the Ocala, Fla., area, where the company had a manufacturing plant until last year. Bernard Castro died in 1991, but Mrs. Castro lives in Ocala.
 
East Coast Expansion
 Krause's manufactures custom upholstered furniture and has 68 plants throughout the western United States. Mr. Gibbons said the purchase of Castro would allow Krause's to expand into the East Coast.
In 1991, Worth had a $1 million loss on sales of $79 million; for 1992, the company was expected to report sales in excess of $100 million.
Castro, a private company, recently retrenched. From 1990 to 1992, the company cut back from 45 showrooms to 18. Last October, the company said sales had declined 30 percent because of the recession. At that time, it closed the Ocala plant, putting 100 people out of work, and shifted production to New York.
Castro's president and chief executive, Bernadette Castro, the daughter of Bernard Castro, said in New York yesterday that she would remain with Krause's for 18 months to assist in the transition.
"It was a hard decision but something we discussed for several years with various sets of investors," Ms. Castro said.
She said the family made "no money" on the company's sale but was able to keep its extensive land holdings in Florida and New York. The family owns more than 4,000 acres of land in Marion County, Fla., in the central part of the state.
"Krause's will take us nationwide," Ms. Castro said. "Even though they will not use our name on the West Coast, they will expand our name greatly on the East Coast."

HEADLINE: Big Board Stocks Finish 6.09 Points Higher

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market staked out higher ground throughout most of the session yesterday, but fell back in the last half-hour, closing up only modestly.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed by as much high as 31 points before closing up 6.09 points at 3,443.28. All other major indexes were up, also modestly, in moderate trading. 
 The vicissitude of the market was especially difficult for analysts to puzzle out yesterday, having come after several recent sessions in which the Dow hugged a narrow trading range. Early in the day, some analysts said that the surge was partly due to a wave of buying in certain stocks by short-sellers, who had committed in earlier sessions to selling shares they did not own.
Short-selling means selling borrowed stock before it is actually purchased; the borrowed stock must eventually be bought and interest paid to the stockbroker for what, in effect, is a loan. Thus, according to the short-seller argument, the winners yesterday were the familiar big losers of previous trading days: stocks like Philip Morris, Merck and Eastman Kodak, all of which were up moderately yesterday.
But short-sellers often zero in on difficult-to-sell stocks, and the sheer volume in individual issues yesterday seemed to undermine the short-seller argument: 1.3 million shares for Kodak, 2 million shares for Merck and 6.87 million shares for Philip Morris.
 The alternative explanations for the market's strength were a firming of bond prices and even a delay in a United States decision on military intervention in Bosnia.
"The fact of the matter is," said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist and portfolio manager for the Dreyfus Corporation, "this is a market characterized by halting rallies and halting sell-offs."
 
 
Bullish and Bearish Factors
 The reason is there is an abundance of both bullish and bearish factors, Mr. Hoey said, with neither side prevailing. On the bearish side are stock valuations that are high, or as Mr. Hoey put it, "fully stretched," as well as an increasing supply of new stock issues. On the bullish side are low short-term interest rates and a river of money spilling into mutual funds, he said.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index was up 0.35 point, to 245.03, and volume was 235.6 million shares, higher than Friday's volume of 223.5 million shares when the Dow closed down 4.7 points. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by 10 to 8.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed up 0.49 point, to 442.80, and the Nasdaq composite index, dominated by high-technology and smaller capitalization stocks, closed up 1.38 points at 682.82. The American Stock Exchange market value index closed up 0.63 point at 426.69.
The Dow was lifted by Goodyear Tire, up 1 3/4, to 38 5/8, and Philip Morris, up 1 3/4, to 52 3/4. Philip Morris was the most active stock on any exchange.
The Dow Jones transportation average, after vaulting 17 points, was down 1.61 points at the end of the day, to 1,569.87. It was dragged lower by Consolidated Railroad, or Conrail, down 7/8, to 51 3/4, and Delta Air Lines, down 1 1/8, to 56, on no discernible news.
 
 
Biggest Decliner
 The biggest percentage decliner on the Big Board was the Discount Corporation of New York, a dealer in United States Government securities. It was down 1/2, or 8.3 percent, to 5 1/2, also on no discernible news.
The biggest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Parker & Parsley Petroleum, an oil explorer and refiner, up 3 1/8, or 14.4 percent, to 24 7/8, on news that it planned to buy $466 million in oil and gas limited partnerships.
Also notable was Gtech Holdings, which rose 1 5/8, to 37 1/2, on news that the New York Supreme Court affirmed a Gtech contract with the New York State Lottery. The court rejected a competitor's legal challenge to the award of the contract. Gtech manufacturers computerized equipment for making lottery bets.

HEADLINE: An East Coast Express? Maybe, in New Rail Plan

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARWICK, R.I., May 10

 BODY:
With faith that three-hour train trips from New York to Boston will be commonplace in a few years, about 100 rail experts gathered here to sketch out the next step: an advanced rail network that would extend over much of eastern North America.
Amtrak hopes to begin work next spring on electrifying the railroad north of New Haven to South Station in Boston, continuing a project that stopped 80 years ago. 
 The result, with a half-billion dollars of new trains that could take advantage of the electrification, would be to cut the trip time by an hour, and increase the railroad's slice of the passenger traffic it shares with the airlines to 60 percent from 15 percent, according to Amtrak. Separately, Maine and the the Federal Government have put up money to run trains from North Station in Boston to Portland.
At a meeting here today, organized by the Northeast Corridor Initiative, a nonprofit group based in Providence, participants proposed a system that would put New York State at the hub of a European-style high-speed rail network. Northeast Corridor service, which now runs on a modern system from Washington through New York to New Haven, and then continues to Boston with a sometimes slow, sometimes unreliable diesel, would continue on through Maine to the Maritime Provinces of Canada.
The route from New York City to Albany would be improved, along with the tracks from there to Montreal and to Buffalo. From Buffalo, the high-speed route would continue across Ontario to Detroit.
 
Looking Beyond the Border
 The rail route from Boston to Albany -- a 120-mile trip that now takes four and a half hours -- would also be modernized. The goal is to build a system that is faster than cars, especially on congested highways, and that compares favorably with planes on trips of a few hundred miles.
All that is needed, said Edward Burke, vice-chairman of the Initiative, is for the railroads to be recognized as the solution to the problems of road congestion, air pollution and high energy use. The technology, he said, is relatively easy.
"In 1921 when Franklin Roosevelt was stricken with polio in Campobello, they brought him through Eastport, Maine, to Washington in eight hours by train," said Mr. Burke, possibly with some hyperbole. But referring to the way the rail system has withered, he said, "Try doing that today."
Underscoring the reality of the transportation market, the day-long session was held at the Johnson & Wales Airport Hotel, across the parking lot from the Providence airport.
 
Federal Support Proposed
 The group announced the formation of a Canadian affiliate to push the plan from north of the border. It will be headed by Remi Bujold, the former Minister of Economic Development in Canada. Serving as co-chairman will be Richard M. Flynn, chairman of the New York Power Authority, and John Buchanan, a member of the Canadian Senate and a former premier of Nova Scotia.
Mr. Flynn and others at the conference said they were encouraged by the Federal Department of Transportation's proposal, made last month, to spend $1.3 billion over five years to encourage high-speed rail. The money could be used to match state spending, said James T. McQueen, associate administrator for railroad development of the Federal Railroad Administration, and if properly leveraged, "makes for a very good start." The money could be used for small public investments in large private projects, he said.
The Amtrak project, for which Congress has already appropriated $447 million, depends in part on an environmental impact statement now being prepared. One unresolved issue is whether electrifying the line would create electromagnetic fields along the right of way that would become a health hazard. The railroad is already installing concrete ties and better rails, and a signal system that can handle trains at 150 miles an hour.
But the ideas face formidable obstacles. For example, the Providence & Worcester Railroad, which handles freight on the Northeast Corridor from New Haven to the Rhode Island-Massachusetts border, is afraid that overhead power lines will be too low to allow triple-decker new car carriers, or containers stacked two high. Worse, very fast passenger trains may prove incompatible with 30-mile-an-hour freight trains, requiring a third track to be built in some areas, but the poles for the overhead power lines may go where the third track would have to be.

HEADLINE: $7.2 Million Grant Persuades Dun & Bradstreet to Move

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In what Connecticut officials hailed as a victory for their economic development campaign, Dun & Bradstreet, the financial information company, said yesterday that it had accepted a $7.2 million grant from Hartford and would move its headquarters staff of 300 people from midtown Manhattan to Wilton, Conn.
The money comes without any strings, and it is one of the largest outright grants Connecticut has ever given to a company. 
 Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who announced the relocation, said it was the result of 18 months of negotiations and reflected a new determination to attract business to Connecticut.
"This is a reaffirmation that the state is moving to rebuild its pro-business reputation," Mr. Weicker said. "We are competing."
 
Little Choice
 In fact, Connecticut had little choice. Dun & Bradstreet approached the state saying it was considering moving its existing operations in Wilton, Conn., to Westchester County or elsewhere. With the Connecticut economy still struggling to bounce back from the recession, state officials were eager to respond.
Dun & Bradstreet's decision, however, is not a repudiation of New York City. Although it is moving its top executives, it will retain 3,000 other workers in Manhattan.
Still, New York City officials said they had tried to persuade Dun & Bradstreet not to move its headquarters. The company, whose name has been all but synonymous with big business in Manhattan for more than 100 year, now has its headquarters on Park Avenue and 48th Street.
But at City Hall, officials said Dun & Bradstreet's departure, while a blow to New York's ego, would have little or no impact on its economy. The officials said New York City had not offered financial incentives to the company to stay, in part because such a small part of the company's Manhattan operations were at stake.
"This was not an economic issue," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, who negotiated with Dun & Bradstreet. "We don't like to lose any company, but New York has more corporate headquarters than any other city, and our franchise is not in jeopardy."
 
Deep Ties to Wall Street
 Dun & Bradstreet, which describes itself as the world's largest business information company, is an amalgam of subsidiaries with deep ties to Wall Street and corporations around the world.
Its major subsidiaries include Moody's Investors Service, the bond rating agency; an information services company that provides credit analysis of businesses; the A. C. Nielsen Company, which analyzes sales of consumer goods and television audiences, and a market research company that specializes in pharmaceuticals.
One advantage of moving to Wilton, an affluent suburban town in Fairfield County, is that the company owns and has only partially occupied the building that is to become its headquarters. It said it acquired the building in 1979, and in recent years has had 273 employees of its A. C. Nielsen subsidiary assigned to it.
Reid H. Gearhart, a Dun & Bradstreet spokesman, said yesterday that "several locations" were considered in addition to the Wilton site, but he declined to elaborate.
Initially, Dun & Bradstreet threatened to vacate the Wilton building and move its employees elsewhere. Later in the negotiations, Mr. Gearhart said, the company approached Connecticut with a proposal to use the Wilton building as its headquarters, but with financial support from the state.
The company said it would use the $7.2 million to renovate the building and to provide training for about 50 new employees to be hired there, mostly clerical workers. It plans to relocate its Nielsen workers elsewhere in Connecticut.
Joseph J. McGee, the state's Economic Development Commissioner, said Connecticut would recoup its grant money in less than three years through the income taxes to be paid by the Dun & Bradstreet headquarters workers, many of whom command high salaries.
 
'Highly Unusual Makeup'
 Mr. Weisbrod said New York's difficulties in persuading the company to retain its Park Avenue headquarters in Manhattan were complicated by what he called the "highly unusual makeup of Dun & Bradstreet."
"This is more or less a holding company," he said, in which senior headquarters staff members travel frequently to manage the affairs of businesses around the world.
"Unlike other financial powerhouses in New York, this is not a top management organization that needs to be in an urban center," he said.
Another benefit of relocating to Wilton is that many top Dun & Bradstreet executives live in the nearby suburbs.
In Harford, Mr. McGee said 42 of the 300 executives who will relocate their offices to Wilton already live in Fairfield County.
Dun & Bradstreet said 200 of its headquarters staff members would move to Wilton in September, with the rest moving there by the end of 1994.
The Manhattan space occupied by Dun & Bradstreet's corporate headquarters will be filled by a company division, Nielsen Media Research, whose current lease expires next year.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Rise

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes rose yesterday as traders and investors awaited the beginning today of quarterly auctions of $35 billion in 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
The three days of auctions start with $16 billion of three-year notes this afternoon. The auctions and new reports on inflation in April will help to determine the direction of the bond market. 
 David Ader, a fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the 3/8-point increase in the price of the 30-year bond was partly a result of too much selling on Friday. Yesterday, he said, many traders decided to reduce their exposure to an adverse market move by buying back bonds.
Although dealers often sell ahead of a Treasury auction to try to get prices lower and make the new securities cheaper, Mr. Ader argued that many dealers were afraid of selling too many bonds ahead of an auction when trading remained in a narrow range.
 
Fear of Exposure
 He said that with basic economic developments generally supportive of bonds and with a lot of cash still waiting to be invested, dealers did not want to be exposed at the lower end of a trading range, since prices could rally and push yields down again.
Mr. Ader said he mainly saw buying by institutions and other investors yesterday in shorter Treasury maturities, like the three- and five-year notes. But he said the price of the 30-year bond probably rose the most yesterday because it fell the most on Friday.
Many traders say they believe that the rally that pushed the yield on the 30-year bond to a 16-year low of 6.72 percent in early March is over. But the employment data on Friday, which reported a smaller-than-expected 119,000 increase in nonfarm payroll jobs in April, shows that economic growth is still sluggish. As such, inflation is not expected to be a threat for some time. In addition, the slow growth makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates any time soon.
With another round of low inflation reports expected this week, investors and traders will be getting the kind of news that would keep yields close to their recent lows.
 
Producer Prices Tomorrow
 The Labor Department will issue the April Producer Price Index tomorrow, the day of the 10-year auction, and the Consumer Price Index on Thursday, the day of the 30-year bond auction.
At the same time, the Clinton Administration's problems in Congress are beginning to worry some investors, who are now much less confident that the President can win approval of the spending cuts and tax increases that are needed to bring down the budget deficit. Combined with the uncertainty about the President's health-care proposal, the President's performance, which had helped the bond rally earlier in the year, is now putting some upward pressure on interest rates.
In trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond rose 12/32 , to 104, as the yield dropped to 6.81 percent, from 6.84 percent on Friday. Earlier in the day, the market regained almost all the ground lost in the selloff on Friday. But by the end of the day, some of those gains had been erased.
The price of the 10-year note was up 5/32 , to yield 5.87 percent, down from 5.90 percent. The price of the three-year note was unchanged at a yield of 4.13 percent.
 
When-Issued Market
 In the when-issued, or pre-auction, market, the yield on the 30-year bond was also at 6.81 percent, down from 6.85 percent Friday. The yield on the 10-year note was down to 5.88 percent from 5.91 percent. For this auction, the Treasury is reopening the current 7.125 percent 30-year bond and the 6.25 percent 10-year note and issuing additional securities with these coupons in an effort to ease a sharp shortage that could make it easier to manipulate the market.
For the three-year note, which will be a new issue, the yield in the when-issued market was at 4.26 percent yesterday, up from 4.24 percent Friday.
At the regular weekly auction of Treasury bills, the average discount rate on the three-month bill was 2.89 percent while the average on the six-month bill was 2.99 percent. Both discount rates were one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, higher than the rates at last week's auction.
Following are the results of the Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Widespread Rally in Dollar Is Aided by Selloff in Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar soared against the British pound and other leading currencies yesterday in a powerful rally that seemed to shake the American currency from its recent doldrums.
The broad advance, while largely technically driven, gave a bullish tone to the dollar after weeks of decline. Strengthening the dollar was a selloff in the pound, which lost nearly 4 cents in value amid growing concerns about the stability of the Conservative Government of Prime Minister John Major. 
 Traders said the dollar's rally had its roots in trading late last week, when the dollar did not sink below a recent psychological bottom against the German mark and began to climb.
 
Loss of Confidence
 That encouraged traders to buy the dollar. It broke 1.5920 German marks in early New York trading, proceeded to crack the 1.6-mark level and settled at 1.6075 marks. That was sharply higher than late Friday's 1.58375 marks.
Much of the dollar buying was by sellers of pounds who are losing confidence in Britain's economic recovery. In addition, speculation mounted yesterday that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, would be replaced after the Government's poor showing in elections last week.
"People were positioned for a lower dollar, and it looks as though they're wrong," said John Nelson, director of foreign exchange at Barclays Bank. "Everything is revolving around liquidation of sterling positions."
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5354, from $1.5730 late on Friday. The pound fetched $1.5340 in New York, sharply lower than late Friday's $1.5720.
The pound's weak tone spread to other European currencies, particularly the mark and the Swiss franc, amid uncertainty about the European economic union and the economy of Germany.
"The fact that those currencies are weakest reinforces that the dollar is beginning a new leg up," said Marc Chandler, a market strategist for IDEA. "These are more than just corrective upticks. There's a generalized stronger dollar tone."
The dollar rally also hurt the Japanese yen. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 110.27 yen, up 0.30 from Friday. In New York, the dollar traded at 111.78 yen late yesterday afternoon, up from late Friday's 110.30.

HEADLINE: East Europe's Low Wages Luring Manufacturers From West Europe

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GYOR, Hungary

 BODY:
Needing a factory to build a new generation of engines, Audi, the German car maker, spent years considering sites in Spain, France, Austria and eastern Germany, among others.
It finally made a choice that is becoming increasingly common among Western manufacturers: Eastern Europe. In particular, Audi and many other manufacturers have picked this Hungarian region 30 miles from the Austrian border to take advantage of sharply lower labor costs and access to Western markets. 
 Although some Eastern European economic officials have complained that investment and purchases by the West have been less than they had hoped, there is no quarrel with the fact that nearly $8 billion has been invested in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic since the fall of Communism. One reason is that wages and social welfare taxes are usually less than half those in the West -- and sometimes as little as a tenth.
That is making Eastern Europe appear to Western industry the same way that Mexico looks to companies in the United States. Just as American companies have shifted labor-intensive production south of the border, Western manufacturers are starting to migrate east, leaving in their wake concern about job losses and a protectionist backlash.
 
Best of Both Worlds
 Big names like Volkswagen, Thomson and General Electric are part of the trend as well as hundreds of smaller concerns. Audi's decision, for example, will ultimately create 1,000 new jobs here and will cost its engine factories in Germany roughly the same number.
At first, the investments were in joint ventures with state-owned companies that were being privatized. Then came entirely new factories. But for the most part the initial investments were intended as an entry into Eastern markets rather than as a way to shift work to the East.
But stiffening competition in almost every industry has manufacturers searching for the least expensive places to make their products. And Eastern Europe offers the best of both worlds: markets with growth potential and low-cost factory sites to make products for Western Europe or anywhere else.
"We are bound to see production moving away to areas where production costs are lower," Horst Krenzler, a European Community official, told a panel of the European Parliament in April. "And it is a problem we are going to have to grapple with for the next 10 to 15 years,"
At a time when much of the European Community is in recession and unemployment and trade tensions are high and rising, labor unions in the West are watching the trend with dismay, anger and some resignation.
"The decision to start producing engines in Hungary was a blow for us, and involved very hard negotiations," said Hans Joachim Werner, a spokesman for the Audi Workers Council in Germany. "It is a question of numbers, after all, and the management's arithmetic was very convincing. Wages there run about two to three Deutsche marks an hour and it is up to 10 times that here."
Audi found that producing in Gyor would be a third less expensive than in eastern Germany, the other finalist for the new plant, said Tamas Bognor, Audi's director of marketing in Hungary. Labor costs are expected to be about half what they would be in Germany, he said.
To win approval for its plan from Audi employee representatives,, Audi had to guarantee that it would funnel a third of the savings to worker retraining and other benefits for employees at its main plant in Bavaria. It also persuaded its workers that low-cost production of components might be the only way for the auto maker to survive in the intensely competitive business.
Workers in steel, textiles, agriculture and other industries have taken a harder line. They are putting pressure on their governments to protect their jobs, even if it means erecting or bolstering trade barriers with Eastern Europe.
Officially, the European Community says that it will continue to liberalize its trade agreements and eventually offer community membership to nations in the East. But it could become harder to maintain that position, community officials say, if jobs continue to migrate eastward.
 
Vastly Lower Costs
 "We see the first signs in textiles and steel, but it is something that is going to become much more acute when we bear in mind that wage costs are lower in the area by a factor of more than 1 to 10," said Mr. Krenzler, who is the community's director general for external relations.
For all the upheaval it is causing in the West, the trend is helping the economies of the East. The region around Gyor has become one of the most popular sites in the old Soviet bloc for Western investment because of its easy access to Austria and Germany. Its regional government and economic development officials spend considerable time in the West touting the area's attributes and have struck deals of one kind or another with more than 700 foreign companies.
Hungary's unemployment rate is 13 percent, but in Gyor-Moson-Sopron County it is 8 percent. The streets of Gyor are bustling, new stores are opening and in a sure sign of economic development, Gyor has a McDonald's.
"The export possibilities are very good from here to both Eastern and Western Europe; we have a highly qualified work force and low operating and wage costs," said Gabor Botos, the president of the county council. "This is attracting jobs."
But manufacturing here can be problematic. Western executives say it is easy to underestimate the expense of modernizing plants or building new ones. Joint ventures and wholly owned plants can absorb tremendous amounts of management time, they say. And lower wages do not by themselves guarantee operating efficiency.
General Electric, whose 1990 investment in the Tungsram light bulb factory in Hungary was one of the pioneering joint ventures in the East, has generated nothing but losses. Last month G.E. injected $195 million into the venture to keep it afloat, raising its total investment to more than $500 million. The company is expected to lose money again this year amid intense competition, high overhead and the effect on exports of a currency considered overvalued by many Western manufacturers.
 
Hard to Beat, Despite Problems
 Still, the labor cost advantage available in Hungary and elsewhere in the East remains a lure, especially for German companies like Audi.
According to a report last year by Morgan Stanley International, average labor costs in 1991 in western Germany were $22.49 an hour, compared with $15.34 in France, $15.27 in the United States, $13.41 in Britain and $13.23 in Japan. In eastern Germany, where workers have been pressing for parity with the West, labor costs were $14.56. But in Hungary they were $1.38 an hour, and in Poland, $1.
"Germany's cost structure is an enormous burden," said Nigel Gault, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill in London. "We're seeing throughout German manufacturing industries a rethinking of where to locate production facilities, and they are deciding in some cases that they cannot afford to produce in Germany anymore. They are deciding that one of the places they want to produce in the future is Eastern Europe."
But wages are rising in Eastern Europe, particularly for Western companies that are paying for the most motivated and skilled workers. Ganz-Hunslet RT, a British-Austrian-Hungarian joint venture in Budapest that exports railway cars, has average labor costs of about $6 an hour including wages and social welfare costs, said Stephen F. Kostyal, the managing director. But that compares with $12 to $15 an hour in Britain, he said.
 
Well-Educated Work Force
 Moreover, workers in most Eastern European nations tend to be as well educated and trainable as their counterparts in the West, executives said.
Thomson Polkolor, a joint venture outside of Warsaw that is 51 percent owned by Thomson, the French consumer electronics company, exports more than three-quarters of its production of television picture tubes, mostly to Western Europe. But the plant has become competitive on a worldwide basis only after considerable investment and effort by Thomson, which paid $35 million for its majority stake. The plant had been closed before Thomson came in, and when production was restarted, as much as a third of the tubes it produced could not pass quality tests.
Thomson brought new technology, retrained workers and reorganized management. Now, said Stanley Urban, the chief financial officer, the rejection rate is down to as low as half a percent, in line with Thomson's best factories around the world.
The company is sufficiently happy with the joint venture's results that it is spending $65 million to upgrade the plant's technology further. However, Mr. Urban said the plant could not compete in the long run on its labor cost advantage alone.
"Labor rates at present are lower than they are in Western Europe but the rate of increase is pretty steep," Mr. Urban said. "We're not looking for a bargain off the backs of our employees. We believe we pay them fairly."

HEADLINE: G.A.O. Sees Softening of Bank Rules

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Congressional auditors chastised Federal bank regulators today for preparing standards that they called "a serious weakening" of the rules Congress intended to prevent management abuses from leading to bank failures.
The banking act Congress passed in 1991 "needs to be fully implemented by meaningful regulations to avoid the costly mistakes of the past," Charles A. Bowsher, the head of the General Accounting Office, said in a letter to the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 The F.D.I.C. is expected to vote on Tuesday on new standards for internal management practices to be followed by banks it regulates, including requirements for annual independent audits, internal controls on lending and the use of audit committees. But the agency, judging by discussions at its recent public meetings, is likely to issue a rule that sets broad guidelines rather than specific strictures and that exempts all but the largest banks from the rule's effects.
The F.D.I.C.'s action appears to reflect a broad decision by regulators, with the blessing of the Clinton Administration, to emphasize giving banks more leeway so that they will lend more freely and help to stimulate the economy.
 
 
A Gentle Touch?
 Experts said that banking regulators, in issuing a stream of rules called for by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, have been adopting a gentle touch that has pleased the industry but dismayed some advocates of tougher regulation.
A month ago, for instance, the Federal Reserve Board proposed rules to carry out another section of the law, and it, too, chose to write broad guidelines rather than precise prescriptions. At issue was a section of the law calling for each Federal banking agency to set standards regarding operations, management, asset quality and other banking practices -- details so arcane that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, calls these "the micromanagement provisions" of the law.
Banking analysts consider the regulators' soft touch in putting the law into effect a big victory for the banking industry, which generally viewed the law's passage as a defeat.
Karen Shaw, president of the Institute for Strategy Development, a banking consultancy, said the rules promulgated by Federal agencies since the law was passed were not as harsh as had been predicted.

HEADLINE: Penelope Gilliatt, 61, Film Critic And Writer for The New Yorker

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Penelope Gilliatt, a writer of fiction, journalism and screenplays, and a longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 61.
She had been in poor health for some time. 
 Ms. Gilliatt (pronounced with a hard G) was best known for the film criticism she wrote from 1968 to 1979 for The New Yorker, where she shared reviewing duties with Pauline Kael, and for her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," a 1971 film starring Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch.
Her short stories were marked by precision, compression and a gift for conveying a dramatic situation through dialogue. Anthony Burgess, reviewing her short-story collection "Nobody's Business" for The New York Times Book Review in 1971, wrote: "She is intelligent, economical, poignant, highly contemporary. She is also innovative."
Ms. Gilliatt, whose maiden name was Penelope Conner, was born in London. Her father, a barrister and later a judge, worked as a director of the BBC. After attending Queen's College, a private school, she came to the United States to enter Bennington College in Vermont on a scholarship. She dropped out during her first year. "I thought I should get on with life, and I'd run out of money," she later said in a newspaper interview.
 
A Contest Winner
 A brief period working for the Institute of Pacific Relations in New York ended when she won a short-story contest sponsored by British Vogue. She returned to London to join the magazine's staff, eventually becoming its features editor. She also contributed freelance articles to The Spectator and New Statesman.
From 1961 to 1967, Ms. Gilliatt served as film critic and, for one year, drama critic of The Observer in London. In 1968 she joined The New Yorker, where, in addition to reviewing film, she contributed many short stories and profiles.
Her first novel, "One by One" (1965), about a menage a trois, contained the seeds of her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," about a London couple, a man and a woman, in love with the same man. The screenplay, which was widely praised for its sensitive, literate treatment of a potentially exploitative subject, was nominated for an Academy Award. The National Society of Film Critics named it the best screenplay of the year, and the New York film critics, in a tie vote, named her co-winner for best screenplay with Larry McMurtry, for "The Last Picture Show.
Ms. Gilliatt left The New Yorker in 1979 on an extended leave of absence after writing a profile on the novelist Graham Greene whose accuracy was challenged by Greene. A novelist, Michael Mewshaw, also complained to the magazine that material in the article had been taken, without credit, from an artcile he had written on Greene for The Nation. At the time, Ms. Gilliatt said that Mr. Greene's charges were a subtle form of practical joke. She continued to contribute short stories to the magazine and in recent years wrote profiles of John Cleese and Jonathan Miller.
 
Known for Her Stories
 Although Ms. Gilliatt wrote five novels, including "A State of Change" (1968) and "The Cutting Edge" (1979), she was best known for her stories, collected in "Come Back if It Doesn't Get Better" (1969), "Nobody's Business" (1972), "Splendid Lives" (1978), "Quotations From Other Lives" (1982) and "They Sleep Without Dreaming" (1985).
Ms. Gilliatt's New Yorker film criticism and profiles were collected in "Unholy Fools" (1973) and "Three-Quarter Face" (1980). Her last book was "To Wit: Skin and Bones of Comedy" (1990), a collection of essays.
Both her marriages, to Roger Gilliatt, a neurosurgeon, and the playwright John Osborne ended in divorce.
She is survived by a sister, Angela Conner of London, and a daughter, Nolan Osborne Parker of East Sussex.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
New TV Deal a Slight to Fans and Players Alike

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
In concocting an unprecedented television deal with two networks, major league club owners have sent messages to their fans and their players. They have told their fans that not all their post-season games are worth watching, and they have told the players that the partnership they have proposed isn't worth the paper it would be written on.
To the fans, the owners have said, look, we have had a maximum of 21 post-season games and you have been able to watch, if you have so desired, all 21 of them. Now we want to increase the maximum number of post-season games to 41, but we want to decrease the number you can watch to 19. 
 That would be the effect of the regionalization of baseball's playoffs. The first, or new round of divisional playoffs, would consist of four series with a maximum of five games each, adding a potential 20 games to the 14 games of the league championship series and seven of the World Series.
But the new round of games would be televised regionally, as would the league championship series, meaning fans could see only one series of the first round and one of the two league championship series. Forget the staggered starts of games six and seven of the latter series as a way of seeing additional games. That gimmick could turn out to be meaningless, depending on the length of the two games.
"What is the equivalent of the A.F.C. and N.F.C. championship games is being televised so that you can't see both," Eugene Orza, a Players Association lawyer, remarked yesterday.
Regionalizing post-season games falls into the category of how more is less. By creating it, the owners are demeaning their sport. But they have long done that. For years, they have undermined the product they sell by complaining about greedy players and their salaries. If General Motors and Ford executives followed a similar approach in talking about their products, everybody in America would be buying foreign-made cars.
The television deal also represents a self-fulfilling prophecy. For a couple of years, owners have been talking about how their television money would be reduced drastically, giving networks no reason to offer more than rock-bottom prices. It was a major part of the owners' doom-and-gloom approach in an effort to show that players' salaries were too high.
Some management people apparently wanted to emphasize that the two-network deal represented a major economic hit, but other officials said w that would only continue the doom-and-gloom approach.
Nothing positive between the clubs and the players has emerged from the deal. The owners, who want the players to accept a salary cap, have talked of forming a partnership with the players, but their relationship suffered a setback yesterday.
Players Association and management officials disputed what management had told the union before the deal was announced Saturday.
"I informed them of the outline of the deal without mentioning which networks were involved," Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, said, discussing a meeting the two sides had last Thursday. "I told them everything I was told about the deal at that point, how it was structured, the fact there was no guarantee."
Donald Fehr, the union head, and Orza disputed the suggestion that they were informed of all of the important details. Furthermore, they said they did not know before the announcement that the deal had been completed.
"If he told us everything he knew about the deal, he didn't know anything," Orza said. "Nothing was said about such things as regionalization and the way post-season games would be televised. It came as a complete shock to me that they would do this deal without getting back to us and getting our input. It's clear they don't want our input. They'd rather be partners with the networks."
The owners will meet Thursday in Chicago to discuss the television deal. Bud Selig, the man in charge in the absence of a commissioner, said he wasn't certain if they would vote on the deal. But the owners might want to ask a question about what might have been.
A baseball lawyer familiar with at least some aspects of the negotiations said that earlier in the talks CBS had offered about $130 million for the same setup they have had for four years. Superstation TBS, he said, offered $40 million to $45 million for an extra round of playoffs. With those offers, the owners could have had perhaps $175 million to divide, two-thirds of the average of $265 million CBS has paid under the expiring contract.
Under the joint venture with NBC and ABC, if they sold $250 million in advertising, which some television people consider a long reach, baseball would net $158 million.
Reducing the gross by 15 percent in agency fees, the net becomes $212.5million. Baseball will get 87.5 percent of the first $160 million in net sales, which is $140 million; $10 million of the next $30 million and 80 percent of everything beyond $190 million. Subtract its $10 million in start-up costs, and baseball would net $158 million.
In this deal, baseball carries all of the risk. In what could have been, it would have carried no risk.

HEADLINE: CLASHES CLOUD U.S. POLICY ON BOSNIA;
End to Sanctions Sought

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 10

 BODY:
The President of the Yugoslav federation, Dobrica Cosic, will soon ask the United Nations to ease economic sanctions against his country in response to its recent decision to halt most supplies to the Serbian nationalist forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a senior Yugoslav official said today.
The aide, Dragoslav Rancic, also said that Yugoslavia would accept the deployment of foreign observers along its border with Bosnia to verify that supply lines have been cut. But he said such observers should also be deployed along Bosnia's border with Croatia, across which military aid for Croatian and Muslim forces now flows freely. 
 In a dramatic turnaround, the Governments of Serbia and its parent state, Yugoslavia, announced on Thursday that they would no longer allow any supplies other than food and medicine to be shipped to their longtime clients in Bosnia. They acted hours after a Bosnian Serb assembly rejected a peace plan.
 
Inspection of Vehicles
 Yugoslav soldiers along the border have received orders to inspect all vehicles seeking to cross into Bosnia and to turn back any that are carrying unauthorized supplies.
A vice-president of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb Republic, Biljana Plavsic, telephoned a Belgrade television station today to complain that she had been turned back at the border. She said Yugoslav border police had shown her a notice ordering them not to admit the Bosnian Serb president, Radovan Karadzic, or other officials. But she said she had managed to slip across.
 
A Deepening Isolation
 Banning Bosnian Serb leaders from entering Yugoslavia would increase their already considerable isolation.
"We are very sorry about that decision of Yugoslavia," Mr. Karadzic said today from his headquarters in Pale. "We know that they are being squeezed and blackmailed, but still it's too strong a measure."
Foreign diplomats in Belgrade were uncertain today whether the new restrictions on movement between Bosnia and Yugoslavia were genuine.
"There are indications that this is a serious step," said one diplomat. "Had they taken it a year ago, we might not be where we are now, and there might have been 100,000 less victims."
Asked if the United Nations might ease sanctions, the diplomat replied, "I think you're getting ahead of the game. We have to see what the follow-through is."

HEADLINE: 2 BUSINESS GROUPS ATTACK TAX PLAN

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Two major business lobbying groups attacked important aspects of President Clinton's tax proposals today, arguing that the plan would weaken the economy and make the tax code less fair.
One group, the United States Chamber of Commerce, lined up against a Clinton plan to tax energy and to increase the corporate income-tax rate to 36 percent from 34 percent. The White House has said the measures would raise $100 billion in the next five to six years. 
 Separately, a group of 300 major corporations and trade associations known as the Tax Reform Action Coalition said it strongly opposed Mr. Clinton's move to increase the top rates for individual and corporate taxes. The group was an important force behind Congress's decision in 1986 to overhaul the income-tax laws, lowering most rates and eliminating an array of shelters and loopholes.
It is unclear how the opposition will affect Mr. Clinton's plan. The two groups join a number of others, including the National Association of Manufacturers, that have come out against parts of the Administration proposal. The tax plan will have its first serious Congressional review this week, when the House Ways and Means Committee meets in private to draft the proposal into legislation.
The Chamber of Commerce has come under attack from conservatives, in Congress and from in its own ranks, who complain that the chamber has not been tough enough on President Clinton. The chamber adopted a "wait and see" position on Mr. Clinton's proposals when they were made public in February, rather than declaring its immediate opposition to tax increases.
Chamber officials insisted that the announcement today was not meant to regain the confidence of conservatives but rather reflected rising disenchantment with the President's policies among the 215,000 businesses represented by the organization.
Meeting with reporters today, the president of the chamber, Richard L. Lesher, said the energy tax would slow economic growth and fuel inflation by raising the costs of producing and shipping manufactured goods. Because imported products would not be similarly taxed, foreign competitors would gain an economic advantage over American goods here and abroad, the chamber's economists contended.
Members of the Tax Reform Action Coalition registered their opposition to income-tax increases in a letter to Mr. Clinton on Thursday. In the letter, made public today, they argued that the increases undid the fundamental compact of the 1986 tax law: the idea that the income tax should be both lower and cover businesses and individuals who had escaped taxation through using loopholes.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Hopes Are as Big as Texas in Senate Race

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, May 10

 BODY:
When Lloyd Bentsen announced late last year that he would quit the Senate to become Treasury Secretary, Texas Democrats spent a few convulsive weeks sorting out whom Gov. Ann W. Richards should name to replace him. Still, at least one thing seemed likely: whoever was chosen would spend a long time in the seat, which has been held by Democrats since Reconstruction.
But then came the special election for the seat on May 1 when the State Treasurer, Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, stunned nearly everyone by placing first in an open field of 24. That left Governor Richards's choice, Bob Krueger, who placed second, as the clear underdog in the June runoff. 
 With the unexpected emergence of Ms. Hutchison, Texas could be on the verge of having two Republican Senators for the first time in modern history.
And President Clinton could be on the verge of having to cope with a major political headache: a Democratic loss in a race that Texas Republicans say they will gleefully cast as a referendum on his Presidency. A loss would also mean erosion of the 57-to-43 edge that Democrats now hold in the Senate.
 
An Assist From Dole
 Republicans in the Senate have already banded together to block the President's multibillion-dollar plan to stimulate the economy. Picking up the Texas seat would embolden the Republicans and their Senate leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, who campaigned over the weekend for Ms. Hutchison.
All told, Republican candidates in the special election won 58 percent of the vote even though the state's Democratic leadership was united behind Mr. Krueger; some of his advisers had even speculated that he might just capture 50 percent and avoid a runoff.
Ms. Hutchison finished first, though by just a few hundred votes from more than the two million cast. She won despite a bruising attack from two Republican Congressmen who repeatedly brought up accusations that she had once pummeled a staff aide with a notebook, pinched others and ordered employees to perform personal chores for her on state time.
Ms. Hutchison denied the accusations, which were leveled by the daughter of former Gov. John B. Connally, Sharon Ammann, who said she was on the receiving end of the notebook assault because she took too long to look up a telephone number that Ms. Hutchison wanted. Both women have said they took polygraph tests that showed they were telling the truth.
 
A Commanding Position
 In the open election Ms. Hutchison weathered the charges, though perhaps only because they were pushed out of the spotlight by the April 19 fire that consumed the Branch Davidian compound near Waco and left 72 people dead.
In any event, many Texas political consultants say Ms. Hutchison is in a commanding position for the runoff, which the Governor has set for June 5.
Part of the reason is Mr. Krueger himself, a former English professor and Elizabethan scholar at Duke University who served in the House of Representatives in the late 1970's but lost two previous campaigns for the Senate. Governor Richards turned to him only after several better-known figures, including former Mayor Henry G. Cisneros of San Antonio, took themselves out of contention. Mr. Cisneros later joined the Clinton Cabinet as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
Even some of Mr. Krueger's allies say the new Senator suffers from a sanctimonious bearing, lackluster campaigning skills and -- perhaps most damaging in a state where people like their politicians to be bold and colorful -- an image as a bland moderate. A Democratic rival once said Mr. Krueger would "run over his own mother to get to the middle of the road."
Still, the Senator has tried to put the best face on the situation, insisting that he likes to run as an underdog.
 
Going on the Offensive
 In the rich tradition of Senate runoffs here, which includes Lyndon B. Johnson's controversial 87-vote victory over Coke Stevenson in 1948 -- the victory that earned him the nickname Landslide Lyndon -- two things are virtually certain: anything can happen, and the race will turn nasty before it is over.
Mr. Krueger wasted no time going on the offensive against Ms. Hutchison, telling reporters the day after the first round of voting that "the people of Texas over the next five weeks will clearly want to assess her integrity."
He promised to make an issue of an investment services contract awarded by Ms. Hutchison's office to Goldman Sachs & Company, one of whose partners is a major supporter of hers. She says the contract, for which she suspended bidding, saved the taxpayers money.
Mr. Krueger, a consistent supporter of abortion rights, also criticizes Ms. Hutchison for what he calls her "multiple choice" position on the issue. She says she favors a woman's right to choose an abortion, but she has also said that states should be entitled to impose restrictions on abortion.
So far, Ms. Hutchison has tried to take the high road. "I talked about my dream for America, and he talked about how negative and how tough this campaign was going to be and how he was going to trash me from one end of this state to the other," she said of Mr. Krueger.
 
No Senatorial Courtesy
 But even if Ms. Hutchison keeps the gloves on, she will get plenty of help from fellow Republicans in attacking the interim Senator. Even before she made it into the runoff, the Republican National Committee was running negative radio advertisements about Mr. Krueger. And Texas's other Senator, Phil Gramm, a Republican, has abandoned all pretense of senatorial courtesy for his Texas colleague, ridiculing what he called Mr. Krueger's "stunningly poor showing" on May 1.
Although no statewide polling data have been made public since the election, a survey of 829 voters by the Mason-Dixon Poll, conducted a few days before the election, included a question about a matchup between Ms. Hutchison and Mr. Krueger. She got 47 percent to his 40 percent, with 13 percent undecided.
For Ms. Hutchison, a victory in the runoff would surely catapult her to national attention. And for the Republicans, it would mark an important step in the party's effort to put more Republican women in office. Four women were elected to the Senate last fall, but all were Democrats. (The only female Republican Senator is Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas.) And only 12 of the 47 women elected to the House were Republicans.
In the May 1 election, the 49-year-old Ms. Hutchison won 593,479 votes while Mr. Krueger, 57, received 592,982. Thus, each of the two front-runners won about 29 percent of the vote.
But given the relative unity among Democrats and Ms. Hutchison's intraparty challenge from Representatives Joe L. Barton and Jack Fields, the results were widely interpreted in Texas as a triumph for Ms. Hutchison and an embarrassment for Mr. Krueger. Mr. Barton and Mr. Fields placed third and fourth, respectively, with about 14 percent each.
Democrats have tried to play down the results, with some claiming that the Senate race was skewed by a large number of anti-tax Texans who turned out to vote against a statewide school-finance proposition that would have shifted some education revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones.
"What she did, in effect, was surf a tax-revolt wave," George C. Shipley, a consultant to Mr. Krueger, said of Ms. Hutchison.

CLOSING OF CONAGRA PLANT TO IDLE 600 WORKERS

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The Conagra Frozen Foods plant in Turlock, Calif., will close in July, leaving about 600 people out of work, the company announced yesterday. The plant, which processes frozen dinners and entrees under the Banquet and Healthy Choice Labels, is a victim of overcapacity, a Conagra vice president, Gil Mulhere, said. 
 The plant, a leading employer in Turlock for 37 years, is operating at less capacity than the seven other plants that make up its division, he said. Its production would be shifted to plants in Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa and Virginia.

HEADLINE: A Useless Filibuster

 BODY:
Sixty votes. That's what it takes to break a Senate filibuster and speed a measure to a floor vote, where only a majority is required for passage. Sixty is the magic number this week as the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, tries yet again to win passage of the "motor-voter" bill -- an overdue political reform designed to make it easier for Americans to vote.
The measure, vetoed by President Bush, would require states to let people register to vote when they obtain or renew a driver's license. It would also require states to permit registration by mail. 
 For want of one vote in March -- there were 59 votes for cloture -- the bill's backers swallowed damaging G.O.P. amendments removing the requirement that states make registration available at public assistance, disability and unemployment offices. The face-saving compromise that has emerged from a House-Senate conference committee mandates registration at welfare and disability offices but makes it optional at unemployment offices. It also adds safeguards against coercion.
Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota, one of a handful of moderate Republicans who voted for the measure last year but not in March, when the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, made it a test of party loyalty, now says he'll vote for the bill.
That should be sufficient to give Mr. Mitchell the 60 votes he needs. Mr. Dole knows that, but he may still put the Democrats through the paces, tossing up the usual arguments about the bill's costs and its potential for fraud. But where's the evidence? The states that already register voters at motor vehicle offices report no increase in cheating.
Mr. Dole's opposition rests not on fear of fraud but fear that the new registrants will vote Democratic. This time, with some luck, democracy of the small "d" variety will prevail.

HEADLINE: Record Store of Near Future: Computers Replace the Racks

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Computer technology has turned its hungry gaze on a pair of well-known institutions: the record store and the video shop.
A vision of the future of entertainment retailing, announced yesterday by I.B.M. and Blockbuster Entertainment, could do away with sprawling stores, aisles and aisles of offerings, and back rooms full of inventory -- be it the latest Michael Jackson recordings, Arnold Schwarzenegger video releases or Nintendo games. 
 In a few years, even a small-town record shop might offer all the titles of the biggest big-city megastore -- not on hand, but summoned from the digital files of big computers thousands of miles away, traveling as electronic impulses to machines in the store that copy recordings or movies on blank CD's or videocassettes.
I.B.M. and the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation announced a partnership yesterday to jointly pursue this vision. The computer giant and the entertainment retailer will work on developing the new distribution technology for use in-house by Blockbuster, which has nearly 3,500 video and music stores. The technology would also be sold to other retailers.
The concept, analysts say, has several advantages over current methods for putting recorded entertainment into consumers' hands, eyes and ears. For retailers, it could eliminate the costs of shipping and inventory, and avoid the loss of business when popular offerings are out of stock.
 
Vastly Expanded Choices
 "It could well change the economics of retailing for record stores and video rental shops," said Tom Adams, an analyst for Paul Kagan & Associates, a research firm in Carmel, Calif.
For consumers, the concept promises almost unlimited availability and diversity. "If a 7-year-old comes in on a Friday night and wants the latest hot video game, the chances are high now that it's sold out," said David Lundeen, vice president of Blockbuster's technology unit. "But with this system, it's never sold out -- you can get another one electronically in a couple of minutes."
Despite its promise, the new technology faces some formidable obstacles. The company formed by the International Business Machines Corporation and Blockbuster to run the system, Fairway Technology Associates, must negotiate with record companies, movie studies and game makers for the rights to sell their wares.
Sony Music, for one, gave the I.B.M.-Blockbuster venture a chilly reception. In a brief statement yesterday afternoon, Sony said it was not supporting the new system, indicating concerns about electronic distribution of its recordings.
"Commercial copying is illegal, and it's not clear to Sony Music what benefit consumers would derive from in-store copying," the company said, though it added that it was confident that I.B.M. and Blockbuster "would not engage in commercial piracy."
Limited previous efforts to market recordings electronically have not had notable success, encountering resistance from consumers, who seemed to prefer retailing's sizzle to cold technological efficiency.
 
A Note of Skepticism
 "Electronic distribution hasn't worked yet," noted Richard Shaffer of Technologic Partners, a consultant in New York. "Consumers don't just want the music. They want the liner notes, the nice picture of Michael Jackson, all that."
In 1988, Tower Records/Video made room in its big record stores for an outside vendor, the Personics Corporation of Menlo, Calif., whose computerized kiosks enabled consumers to make their own customized audio cassette tapes. The systems were popular for a while, but customers eventually lost interest. Personics wound up in bankruptcy court in 1991.
"In the end, its kiosks were just sitting around, unused," said Robert Delanoy, vice president of retail record sales for Tower.
Personics, Mr. Delanoy said, had trouble getting licensing rights from record companies, and thus had a limited selection. And most customers preferred to just buy tapes rather than compile their own.
For his part, Mr. Delanoy is skeptical about the I.B.M.-Blockbuster effort. "We're going to keep on doing this the old-fashioned way -- just sell 'em," he said.
 
Backers See Advantages
 Yet I.B.M. and Blockbuster are convinced they have a more advanced system, more marketing muscle and better timing. "This is a distribution channel with compelling advantages for retailers, content suppliers and consumers," said Robert Carberry, president of Fireworks Partners, the I.B.M. unit handling the partnership with Blockbuster.
The new system, which should be available in the first half of next year, will involve a kiosk in the store, where consumers will order selections by touching a computer screen. The first offerings will be audio compact disks and video games, with videocassettes offered later.
Working models of the system copy CD albums in about six minutes. Color laser printers in the kiosk will reproduce the jacket pictures and liner notes -- with a quality that company officials say is indistinguishable from factory production.
At the outset, the price of the electronically distributed CD's will be the same as those from the factory. But that could eventually change, since $3 to $4 of the cost of a $15 CD now goes for transportation.
Unlike the early system tried at Tower Record stores, the I.B.M.-Blockbuster venture will offer only the same CD albums that the record companies market. It will not give consumers the option of making their own album by picking and choosing songs , for instance.
 
Maybe Easing Some Fears
 That restriction, I.B.M. and Blockbuster officials say, should simplify the task of counting the number of times a recording is transmitted from a central computer bank to stores, presumably allaying record companies' fears about piracy. And it would simplify the task of paying record companies a fee each time a recording is reproduced.
Officials with the venture say they have held talks with some record companies, game makers and movie studios, and many of them are intrigued. A big Japanese video game producer, for instance, is said to be quite interested. In its statement, Sony said it had not been contacted by either I.B.M. or Blockbuster.


GRAPHIC: I.B.M. and Blockbuster Entertainment intend to develop computerized retail booths were customers can have their choices from a vast library of digitally recorded music, video games, computer software or nearly any kind of digital information manufactured to order in minutes. Here is how the technology might work for music recorded on compact disks.
 
1. Participating record companies put their recordings in digital form into a master computer library called a regional server.
 
2. Booths installed at retail stores have permanent high-speed data links to the regional server.
 
3. A customer in a booth slips a credit card through a swipe card reader. The computer built in to the booth checks the store's data base for information about the customer's past purchases and displays a menu of choices tailored to the customer.
 
4. The customer navigates through menus and makes selections by touching the screen. Video clips and sample cuts can be played to help the customer choose an album.
 
5. The computer in the booth signals the regional server to transmit the customer's selection and charge the cost to the customer's credit card.
 
6. The selection is transmitted to the booth, where it is recorded on a blank CD, while labels and packaging are printed by a color printer. The manufacturing process takes at least six minutes.
 
7. While the customer waits, the booth computer may offer related merchandise like concert tickets or posters, or show video clips.
 
8. When the CD and its packaging are ready, they appear in the booth for the customer to take.

HEADLINE: SERBIA'S PRESIDENT CALLS FOR MEETING OF HIS COUNTRYMEN

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Wednesday, May 12

 BODY:
In a move apparently intended to override the rejection of an international peace plan by Bosnian Serb leaders, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia demanded on Tuesday that the leaders cancel their proposed referendum on the plan.
He called on them to come to Belgrade on Friday for an extraordinary gathering of legislators from all of the Serbian-populated regions in the Balkans. 
 Early this morning, the Yugoslav press agency reported that the Bosnian Serbs had rejected Mr. Milosevic's invitation and said they would go ahead with the referendum. Because the Milosevic proposal was endorsed by virtually all of the key leaders of the various Serbian republics, it appears that the Bosnian Serbs have placed themselves in virtually complete political and military isolation.
 
Unclear if Session Will Proceed
 It is unclear whether Mr. Milosevic will go ahead with the meeting without the Bosnian Serbs, bringing together members of the Serbian, Montenegrin and federal Yugoslav Parliaments, and representatives of the self-declared Serbian Krajina Republic in Croatia.
Even if the Bosnian Serbs' assembly would have voted once more against the peace plan at the proposed gathering, their votes would have been overwhelmed by those of the other legislatures, which are expected to support the plan with great majorities.
The Bosnian Serbs' referendum, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, is expected to result in a vote against the plan, which was drafted by Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen. The Bosnian Serb leaders said today that they would consider attending a pan-Serbian meeting, but only after the referendum.
 
'Of Utmost Importance'
 "The decision on the Vance-Owen peace plan is of utmost importance not only for the Serbian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also for Serbia, Montenegro, the Serbian Krajina Republic and the Serbian people as a whole," Mr. Milosevic told the Yugoslav press agency. "Support for the Vance-Owen plan is the same as support for peace, and this fact can be overlooked only by those who are not motivated by the interests of Serbia and its people."
Because of Serbia's previous support for its brethern in Bosnia, the United Nations has imposed sharp economic sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, and Mr. Milosevic's actions against the Bosnian Serbs are in part meant to encourage the United Nations to lift the embargo. But Western diplomats here are becoming increasingly convinced that genuine resentment now exists between the Bosnian Serbs and the leaders in Serbia.
As soon as the peace plan is approved, Mr. Milosevic asserted, "tensions will ease, the standard of living will rise and citizens will be relieved of uncertainty and the fear of war."
"Serbia must now start thinking of itself," he said.
 
Milosevic's Campaign for Plan
 Mr. Milosevic's statements and his proposal for the joint parliamentary session on Friday were the latest steps in his intensifying campaign to win approval of the peace plan and bring an end to the embargo.
At a session in the Bosnian town of Pale last week, the Bosnian Serb assembly rejected Mr. Milosevic's plea to endorse the Vance-Owen plan, which would divide their war-torn land into 10 semiautonomous provinces. They voted instead to hold a referendum on the plan, but neither Mr. Milosevic nor foreign diplomats here considered that an acceptable alternative.
Since then, Mr. Milosevic has been steadily increasing pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to reverse their decision. Only hours after the vote in Pale, the Governments of Serbia and Yugoslavia announced that they were cutting all military and logistical aid to the Bosnian Serbs. Later they reportedly banned Bosnian Serb leaders from entering Yugoslav territory.
In recent days, Mr. Milosevic's campaign has intensified, with bitter attacks against Bosnian Serb leaders in the Government-controlled press. Only a week ago, these leaders were being portrayed here as heroic fighters who were making great sacrifices to defend the Serbian nation. Now they are depicted as reckless adventurists who live in luxury while their people suffer.
One of the principal targets of this new campaign has been the president of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, Radovan Karadzic. A television broadcast today reported that Dr. Karadzic was a heavy gambler who had run up the equivalent of $200,000 in debts at a Belgrade casino. Newspaper reports have alleged that his daughter lives in a luxurious villa she received as a gift from a Serbian-American millionaire, and that his son recently sought to push wounded soldiers off a relief flight to make room for his dog.
Another newspaper story said that one of Dr. Karadzic's vice presidents, Biljana Plavsic, had bought a luxury apartment in Belgrade despite having no known source of income.
"The whole Bosnian Serb leadership, and by extension the referendum they have called, is being vilified and ridiculed," a European diplomat said. "The goal is to convince people that there is no point in fighting or suffering for people like that. Milosevic is making a U-turn in order to get the peace plan approved, which he now believes is essential if he is to stay in power. This is a very interesting moment."
A senior Yugoslav official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Milosevic was determined at all costs to win approval of the Vance-Owen plan.
"The reason is simple," he said. "We are exhausted."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. Watches Supply Flow
 Special to The New York Times
WASHINGTON, May 11 -- Administration officials said today that it was too early to tell whether Serbia was carrying out President Milosevic's pledge to choke off the flow of material and equipment to Serbs in Bosnia.
Initial intelligence reports indicate that truck traffic -- including some oil tankers and military transport vehicles -- continues across the principal bridges that link Bosnia to Serbia.
But officials said that while American spy satellites could produce detailed photos of roads in the Balkans, it was difficult to detect from above whether a given truck was stocked with bread or mortar rounds.
Although the Bosnian Serbs have stockpiled ammunition, they depend on Serbia for fuel and spare parts. Janez Jansa, the Defense Minister of Slovenia, said recently that the war would begin to wind down in weeks if Mr. Milosevic really turned off the logistical pipeline to the Bosnian Serbs.

Chart: "Balkan Update"
At the United Nations, BOSNIA formally requested withdrawal of peacekeepers and workers from Bosnia yesterday in the hope that a Security Council arms embargo would be lifted. The Council is unlikely to agree.
Yugoslav leaders in BELGRADE appealed to Bosnian Serbs to join a vote of all Serbian lawmakers in the former Yugoslavia on a peace plan for Bosnia. But the Bosnian Serbs rebuffed the plan, which would undermine their own referendum. The plan was expected to fail the referendum but would have a chance of passing in a pan-Serbian vote.
Clinton Administration officials traveling with the President in Illinois said the he is considering sending troops to the former Yugoslav republic of MACEDONIA to bolster peacekeeping forces.

HEADLINE: Compromise on Military Gay Ban Gaining Support Among Senators

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Senior Senate Democrats and Republicans are beginning to coalesce around a proposal that would end the military's efforts at unmasking homosexuals but would continue to bar gay men and women from serving if they are open about their sexuality.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, summarizes the policy as, "Don't ask, don't tell." It would mean that the military would not ask new recruits about their sexual orientation or conduct investigations meant to ferret out homosexuals. 
 But it would also impose a strict code of conduct that would address such questions as harassment, holding hands on base and same-sex dancing.
 
Opposed by Clinton
 The Clinton Administration and gay-rights groups oppose the plan, which would essentially make permanent an interim Defense Department policy worked out by President Clinton and Senator Nunn in January. The temporary plan stopped the practice of asking recruits their sexual orientation, but it still allows the armed services to place declared homosexuals in a special-reserve status until Mr. Clinton issues a new policy.
The proposal, which still lacks specific details, today received the endorsement of the commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf war, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. "Open homosexuality is the problem," the retired general told a hearing of the Armed Services Committee.
General Schwarzkopf told senators that allowing declared gay men and lesbians to serve in the armed forces would result in disheartened troops. Testifying in his familiar booming voice, General Schwarzkopf likened such demoralized soldiers to the Iraqis "who sat in the deserts of Kuwait" when allied forces rolled through.
 
Supported by Sailors
 The compromise, enthusiastically received by scores of Navy sailors whom senators interviewed at the Norfolk Navy Base on Monday, has suddenly gained momentum. Senators John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, and Jim Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, today lent their support to the proposal.
"What this says is that people can't identify themselves as being gay and stay in the military," said one Pentagon official. "It contradicts the President's commitment and his order to the military to draft a policy that lifts the ban."
Defense Secretary Les Aspin must present a draft executive order to Mr. Clinton by July 15. The Pentagon has two groups -- about 50 military officers and the Rand Corporation -- studying how to carry out the directive. Senior aides to Mr. Aspin say they will begin consulting with advocacy groups, military leaders and lawmakers in early June.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the other military service chiefs would almost certainly support the compromise since it would codify the interim policy they have already approved.
Thomas B. Stoddard, coordinator of the Campaign for Military Service, a gay-rights group, said Senator Nunn's proposal would not end discrimination against gay service members.
 
'A Lawyer's Tinkering'?
 " 'Don't ask, don't tell' is a lawyer's tinkering with a policy that must be rooted out in its entirely if equal protection of the law means anything," said Mr. Stoddard.
It is unclear how deep support for the compromise runs in the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has been holding hearings on whether homosexuals should be allowed to join the military since late March. Senator Nunn and the panel's ranking Republican, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, both favor the plan.
A spokesman for Senator Dan Coats, one of the ban's strongest proponents, said the Indiana Republican has sensed a shift toward the compromise but is waiting to hear more testimony.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, strongly oppose the compromise. "Members of the armed forces, like any other Americans, should be judged by their ability, not by the prejudice of others," said Mr. Kennedy's spokeswoman, Pamela Hughes.
 
Senate Backing Predicted
 One senior Senate aide said, "We haven't done any kind of a head count, but my feeling is that the compromise would get a heck of lot more votes than Clinton's position."
Supporters of the compromise acknowledged that defining homosexual behavior posed a brier patch of hypothetical situations to untangle. A spirited exchange between General Schwarzkopf and Senator Levin illustrated the point.
Seated alongside two Marine Corps officers and a senior Navy enlisted officer at the witness table, General Schwarzkopf summarized: "Don't ask the question, but don't tolerate any homosexual activity or behavior in the organization."
When Senator Levin asked if reading a magazine that catered to homosexuals constituted homosexual activity, General Schwarzkopf said, "No."
 
A Barracks Scenario
 But then General Schwarzkopf added that if a soldier was reading the magazine "in the barracks on a continuous basis to the point where it caused all those around you to be concerned about your sexual orientation and it started to cause polarization within your outfit," the offending service member should be removed.
Several gay people, some on active duty and others who have left the service, testified at the Senate hearing and took issue with General Schwarzkopf and Senator Nunn's compromise.
"As long as there's a regulation out there, someone will have the power to use that threat against me," said Margarethe Cammermeyer, a former colonel and chief nurse in the Washington State National Guard. She was discharged last year for acknowledging that she is a lesbian.
 
A Father's Discovery
 The hearing's most emotional moment was provided by a Marine colonel, Fred Peck, who became familiar to Americans as the military spokesman for the multinational operation in Somalia.
Colonel Peck, who returned last week from five months in Somalia, told senators that if the military ends its ban on openly gay members he would tell his sons to stay out -- especially the one who is homosexual. Colonel Peck said he would fear for the life of his 24-year-old son, Scott, an aspiring journalist at the University of Maryland.
"I love him as much as I do any of my sons," said Colonel Peck, who later told reporters he learned of his son's sexual orientation just five days ago.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Passes the Hat Among Supporters at Ellis I.

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Trying to cash in on a strong showing against his Democratic challengers in several recent polls, Mayor David N. Dinkins was joined by 750 supporters on Ellis Island last night for an elegant salute to his mayoralty and a passing-of-the-hat that his campaign hoped would net $1 million.
The Mayor chose the unusual site for the fund-raiser to emphasize a theme that no doubt will figure prominently in his re-election campaign: inclusion. Both the location and the evening's program were intended to reinforce Mr. Dinkins's image as a healer, a political leader capable of bringing together New Yorkers of diverse ethnic, racial and religious backgrounds. 
 But the selection of Ellis Island also raised anew a two-year-old dispute over a quotation attributed to the Mayor in a profile in Vanity Fair magazine in January 1991. Mr. Dinkins, the magazine said, told his friend, Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, that he had declined to attend the formal opening of the renovated immigrant reception center on Ellis Island.
"Ellis Island is for the people who came over on the ships! My people came over in chains," the magazine said Mr. Dinkins had told Mr. Rangel as they marched an an African-American Day Parade.
"I don't want any part of those people from the ships today," it quoted the Mayor as saying. "Today, I am coming home."
 
'All in the Same Boat Now'
 Mr. Dinkins said yesterday at a news conference at City Hall that he had been misquoted. The Mayor insisted, as he has before, that he never made the remarks attributed to him.
"That's not what I said," Mr. Dinkins said. "I don't talk that way. You have heard me. When I talk about Ellis Island and immigrants in general, I have a set thing.
"I say always, because I very deeply believe it, I say that some of us, our ancestors may have come on the Mayflower, and others of us our ancestors were here to greet the Mayflower. Still others came on ships seeking freedom from oppression, as our Haitian brothers and sisters do this very day. Some others came on ships seeking freedom of religion. My ancestors came in the hold of slave ships and in chains.
"But the significant thing is, irrespective of the ships on which our ancestors may have come, we're all in the same boat now."
Mr. Dinkins did not attend the opening ceremonies at Ellis Island, having chosen instead to march in the African-American Day Parade, the Mayor's press secretary, Leland T. Jones, said late yesterday.
Mr. Dinkins's campaign tried last night to reinforce the theme of inclusiveness in the fund-raiser. For example, invitations showed the torch of the Statue of Liberty raised to a globe surrounded by this slogan: "We are one world. We are one people."
The Mayor, standing against the glittering backdrop of the Manhattan skyline across the bay, predicted that he would be re-elected in the fall.
"We will prove again that the values and ideals that made our city a mecca for immigrants from every continent are still powerful and compelling," Mr. Dinkins said. "We will prove again that New Yorkers share our vision of New York as a city of economic strength and economic opportunity for all. A city of toughness and decency. A city with big dreams and a bigger heart."
"With your help," he continued, "we will in September and November of 1993 -- not just for a candidate, but for our enduring ideals and our best hopes."
The Dinkins campaign hoped to raise $1 million from last night's event, said Leah C. Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Dinkins campaign, including those who attended, paying $1,000 a ticket, and others who could not attend but made donations.
Among the celebrities who spoke at the dinner were Mary Tyler Moore, the salsa musician Willie Colon and Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, the widow of Arthur Ashe.
Mr. Dinkins's chief rivals, Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former United States Attorney, held their own fund-raisers two weeks ago. Mr. Giuliani raised about $1 million for his Republican campaign at a dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria, while Mr. Stein took in several hundred thousand dollars at a party at the St. Regis Hotel for his challenge to Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic primary.
It is not possible to say exactly how much each campaign has raised, because the last reporting date was in January and the next is not until July. In January, Mr. Stein had raised the most money, $4.7 million, compared with $3 million for Mr. Dinkins and $2.25 million for Mr. Giuliani, but Mr. Stein has also had the highest expenses. The three major candidates all had roughly comparable amounts on hand -- around $2 million -- after factoring in the matching city funds for which Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Dinkins are eligible.
The most recent poll on the mayoral race, released on Monday by Quinnipiac College in Connecticut, showed Mr. Dinkins ahead of Mr. Stein, 43 percent to 17 percent. Herman Badillo, the former Bronx Borough President, trailed with 9 percent of those surveyed and Roy Innis, the head of the Congress of Racial Equality, had 6 percent. The survey of 1,001 registered city voters had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.
The Quinnipiac poll also showed the Mayor and Mr. Giuliani in a statistical tie. The survey showed Mr. Dinkins with 43 percent of those surveyed, Mr. Giuliani with 40 percent and 17 percent undecided. Because of the margin of error, the results represent a dead heat.
In a related development, George J. Marlin, a municipal bond expert who has never run for office before, formally announced that he was seeking the Conservative Party nomination for Mayor. Mr. Marlin, who is challenging Mr. Giuliani for the nomination, called both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Dinkins failed liberals.
When the remark was repeated to the Mayor by a reporter, Mr. Dinkins laughed heartily. "It's going to be an interesting campaign with him in it," the Mayor said.

HEADLINE: The Economics of Wait and See

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
As economic growth has slowed in the last few months, business executives have exhibited signs of nervousness. Many have scaled back expansion plans, put hiring on the back burner and held down capital spending.
The uncertainty in Washington is clearly one reason for the hesitation. But even as executives keep one eye on Congress and another on the White House, many say their caution comes as much from their own modest order books and economic forecasts as from the political outlook. This wariness comes at a stage in the business cycle when attitudes normally turn more ebullient and is likely to help turn predictions for only moderate growth into reality. 
 "We quite frankly are waiting to see," said Allen I. Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Federated Department Stores. "We are trying to understand where it's all going. We're just not seeing a lot of activity. We have to be conservative. There's a sense of uneasiness about the future."
Gerry Saylor, chief economist at Deere & Company, the largest farm equipment company in the world, blamed "uncertainty over policy" for part of the reluctance of business to expand. But, he added, "70 percent is explainable by the slow recovery."
Even though most forecasts called for slower growth this year than at the end of 1992, unexpectedly sluggish activity in many economic sectors -- from industrial production to retail spending -- clearly is taking its own toll on business plans. In March, for example, when the forecasting firm Cahners Economics asked 400 business executives in its monthly poll what was holding back their expansion plans, more than two-thirds blamed sluggish economic prospects for their caution.
It is a theme voiced by executives in many industries.
"We were hoping that the economy would have firmed up more by now than it has," said James Treadway, president of Seattle-based Westin Hotels and Resorts, North America.
Mr. Treadway noted that the lodging industry was still slowly digging "out of the hole we found ourselves in after the gulf war." Instead of building new hotels, he said, Westin was aggressively taking over management of its properties from others.
 
Dissatisfaction With Clinton
 To be sure, the Washington scene is also making many executives uneasy. To some executives, the defeat of the Administration's economic stimulus package signaled that other Clinton programs to help the economy -- including strengthening the infrastructure and developing new technologies -- face rough sailing, and that, too, helped cool nascent business enthusiasm.
"The Clinton Administration has been extraordinarily ineffective in getting the pork through," said T. J. Rodgers, the chief executive officer of the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation. He said the "broad pragmatic middle" of the business community is saying to itself, "the pork's in jeopardy; the taxes aren't."
"The political side reinforces the economic side," said Kermit Baker, chief economist at Cahners Economics. "If the economy were healthier, we'd see a different reaction to some of the plans being proposed in Washington."
The economic and political uncertainties are affecting growth plans in many different ways.
"It's not a great market in which to raise capital," said J. J. Finkelstein, the president and chief executive of Cryomedical Services Inc., a five-year-old biomedical company in Rockville, Md. "We had to fund our launch from within. It hasn't really stopped us, it's just given us less of a cushion. It's kept us lean."
Health-care companies are particularly handicapped now, Mr. Finkelstein said. "It's difficult for medical companies to make decisions when they don't know where they'll be tomorrow. At the meetings I attend in my industry, the single most common question and discussion is where health-care reform will come out."
Of course, to the extent that prospects brighten and the economy starts looking better, that, too, feeds on itself.
"Once business thinks prospects are brighter, they start investing," said George Hatsopoulos, chief executive of Thermoelectron, a Waltham, Mass., high-technology company. "The moment that they invest, employment grows, the thing snowballs. This has not happened. We never got to the point of sustained optimism in the business community."
For now, however, even as executives see some improvement -- and can make the case for yet more -- they are being very careful not to let costs rise.
The Hechinger Corporation, for example, a home improvement and hardware store chain with 122 stores, is still planning to add 10 new stores this year. At the same time, however, John Hechinger Jr., the chief executive, talks of seeking ways to cut costs.
"We'll continue to focus sharp control in the area of overhead -- the back office or back room. We'll concentrate aggressive energy in reducing expenses and infrastructure, even payroll -- and instead, invest capital at the point of contact with customers," he said.
At the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, there also are prospects for growth -- but also for belt tightening.
"There is certainly a substantial pent-up demand for housing in this country," said James C. Van Meter, chief financial officer at the Atlanta-based forest products company. "But people are not inclined to want to make the commitment that's required to purchase a new home when they're worried about jobs."
"While we haven't seen a large spike in demand, we are prepared for the normal construction season," he said, but added: "Our managers try to keep the head count as low as consistent with prudent operations."
 
Damp Entrepreneurial Spirt
 Even entrepreneurs are sounding conservative. "We're not hiring ahead of the curve," said Jean Villanueva, a corporate vice president America On-Line Inc. a Vienna, Va., company that sells data to computer users.
The Navistar International Corporation, a Chicago-based truck manufacturer, said the company was not planning to expand its head count despite its expecting truck sales to be up solidly this year.
"Companies are still very willing to make investments where there are good payoffs," said Mr. Saylor of Deere. But most of those investments, he said, were designed to bolster productivity, or output per machine or per worker, rather than total production.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Lends Support To the Free-Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
The House majority leader today broadly endorsed the Clinton Administration's trade policies toward Mexico and Japan, while calling for legislation later this year to extend the use of trade sanctions in labor and environmental disputes.
The endorsement from Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, the most prominent advocate in Congress of a more confrontational trade policy, has political effects. It is aimed at protecting the Administration from criticism by labor and some environmental groups who argue that Clinton trade policy is not tough enough. 
 The proposed legislation would provide cover for lawmakers who want to vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement, in the face of arguments from these critics that the pact fails to address inequities inherent in low Mexican wages and lax enforcement of environmental controls.
Mr. Gephardt also endorsed the Administration's request for an extension until December of the President's authority to negotiate a 112-nation global trade agreement -- within the Uruguay Round of tariff talks -- and submit it to Congress with no amendments allowed.
Extension here of "fast track" authority requires approval by both houses of Congress. Mr. Gephardt's comments improve the odds of its emerging from Congress unaltered.
The legislation that the majority leader proposed today would have a limited effect on Mexico or Canada, the two countries with which the Bush Administration negotiated the North American accord. It would authorize the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, to impose sanctions on countries that failed to enforce their labor and environmental laws. The North American pact would limit the application of such measures to Mexico and Canada.
Sanctions concerning labor and environmental issues would be possible against Mexico or Canada if such provisions are included in side agreements being negotiated for the North American pact. Administration officials are debating this week whether to include these sanctions.
Mr. Gephardt avoided taking a position today on whether trade sanctions should be included in the side agreements, though unions and some environmental groups have called for this. He said he would wait to see what the Administration was able to negotiate with Canada and Mexico.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
A Return to Profits for Equitable

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
The Equitable reported yesterday its first profitable quarter since 1989 -- the latest chapter in the turnaround story of an insurance giant that faced insolvency as recently as two years ago.
After-tax earnings for the first quarter of this year totaled $31.8 million, the company said, compared with a loss of $18.6 million for the corresponding period in 1992. 
 The good news for the company came 10 months after the Equitable Companies went public and received $1 billion in capital from Groupe Axa, the third-largest insurance company in France. Since going public in July at $9 a share, the stock has risen as high as $22. The stock closed yesterday at $21.75, up 62.5 cents.
 
Luck and Skill Helped
 "The improved profitability for the quarter reflects the continuation of significant positive trends in our core businesses," said Richard H. Jenrette, the Equitable's chairman and chief executive. "The company's investment services segment had another outstanding performance, and Equitable's insurance segments continued to show substantial improvement."
The company has benefited from both luck and skillful management by Mr. Jenrette, analysts said yesterday. It was luck that the company went public just before a stock and bond market rally that not only improved its investment portfolio but also bolstered profits in its financial services units, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and the Alliance Capital Management Corporation.
But the analysts also cautioned that the company's stock price, buoyed by excitement in all financial services stocks, may have run ahead of Equitable's recovery.
"It is a good company and it is a survivor," said Dan Murray, an analyst with Argus Research in New York. "But considering the quality of their assets -- they have a tremendous amount of underperforming real estate -- I think the price has gotten ahead of itself."
Two years ago, Equitable appeared to be a classic story of 1980's failure. Then a mutual insurer owned by its policyholders, the company tried to lure investors with hot new products that paid high interest rates. Equitable's Guaranteed Investment Contracts paid up to 18 percent yearly and were backed by junk bonds and real estate. But junk bonds and real estate plummeted in value, and many analysts said that Equitable was at risk of insolvency.
In 1990, the company installed Mr. Jenrette, who cut costs and assets and who reached an agreement with Axa to give the French company a 49 percent stake in Equitable in exchange for capital. Equitable raised $450 million in its initial public offering of common stock and an additional $800 million from an issue of convertible preferred stock.
In its announcement yesterday, the Equitable said its pretax earnings for the first quarter totaled $48.3 million, up from $9.4 million one year earlier.
After-tax operating income from insurance operations totaled $21 million in the first quarter, compared with $4.8 million for the quarter last year. Both numbers exclude disability income losses and investment transaction gains and losses.
The Equitable's investment business generated after-tax earnings of $46.4 million for the first quarter of 1993, down from $49.3 million in the corresponding period of 1992. The company reported a loss on its disability income business of $31.6 million, compared with a loss of $4.5 million a year earlier. The company is trying to shed that business.
The company's overall after-tax earnings of $31.8 million included investment gains outside of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette of $7.3 million and restructuring charges of $3.9 million. The loss in the first quarter of 1992 included investment losses and one-time charges of $46 million.
But analysts said the company remained dependent on its investment services operations, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and Alliance Capital Management, which have benefited greatly from rallies in stocks and bonds. The Equitable's problem commercial mortgages totaled $299.1 million at the end of March, down from $388.4 million.
Shelly Harris, a director of the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the Wall Street rating agency, said that because real estate problems were expected to continue, Equitable's life insurance operation must raise more capital and increase sales to meet investors' expectations.
Although the company's agents have largely remained loyal to Equitable, Ms. Harris said, the premiums generated in 1992 were below that of 1990.
"They have a new generation of insurance products," Ms. Harris said. "The field force has got to get out there and sell them."

The Equitable Cos. was a mutual company during the first half of 1992, and therefore, there are no year-ago shares outstanding.
The latest quarter included restructuring charges of $3.9 million and investment gains of $7.3 million. The year-ago period included investment losses of $24.3 million and restructuring charges of $1.9 million.
Equitable said that the latest quarter results included an after-tax loss of $31.6 million from the disability income business, compared with an after-tax loss of $4.5 million from the segment in the year-ago period.

HEADLINE: Sharply and Loudly, G.O.P. Rivals Debate

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHIPPANY, N.J., May 11

 BODY:
The three major candidates for the New Jersey Republican gubernatorial nomination participated in their first televised debate tonight, getting little chance to differentiate themselves from their rivals but giving voters across the state a barb-filled, free-wheeling 90-minute preview of the final weeks of the campaign.
The clash began with the opening question, on the controversial $2.8 billion tax increase that Gov. Jim Florio pushed through three years ago. The three -- Christine Todd Whitman, Jim Wallwork and Cary Edwards -- alternately cut one another other off or tried to shout one another down. 
 "Cary, you keep putting words in my mouth," Mrs. Whitman said at one point. "You've done that about 15 times."
With the primary four weeks from tonight, the campaign has turned into the backbiting race that party leaders had dreaded, as Mr. Edwards and Mr. Wallwork work feverishly to close the advantage in the polls each acknowledges that Mrs. Whitman has.
That turned the debate in a ballroom at the Birchwood Manor here into open season on Mrs. Whitman, who responded in kind.
The event was televised live over New Jersey Network, the state-supported public television network, which was co-sponsor of the debate along with the State Chamber of Commerce. It was the first of two mandatory and televised debates involving candidates who receive public campaign financing.
 
Florio Tax Increase
 One of the few points that the Republicans agreed on tonight was dislike of the Florio tax increase, one of the most contentious issues in New Jersey political history.
Mr. Florio has said he was forced to raise taxes after following the Republican administration of Thomas H. Kean and finding the state was nearly broke. But the Republicans here tonight blamed the increase for stagnating the state's economy and contributing to the 9.1 percent unemployment figure announced last week. Still, they quarreled over just what to do about the taxes.
Mr. Edwards proposed that the rollback should begin with the budget now under discussion for the 1994 fiscal year that begins on July 1.
Mrs. Whitman said her goal would be to repeal the Florio taxes.
 
Stinging Exchanges
 The debate guidelines, as announced before the debate by the moderator, Michael Aron, a political reporter for NJN, allowed the candidates to break into the others' comments.
That made for some stinging exchanges.
When Mr. Edwards said he would demand an elected auditor to help his shape his decision on budget cuts, Mr. Wallwork interjected that he would accomplish it with the gubernatorial line-item veto powers.
Mr. Wallwork was not able to expand on that thought before Mrs. Whitman pounced. "That is a traditional kind of response to the problems we have, add another layer of government," said Mrs. Whitman in response to Mr. Edwards. "We have all the tools we need right now, Cary, to do it."
"You don't know what you're talking about," Mr. Edwards shot back.
When the question of crime arose, Mrs. Whitman cut off the anticipated attack on her from Mr. Edwards, a former State Attorney General who has accused her of being soft on crime, by launching a surprise attack on his own record.
"If you look at the time when he was the chief law enforcement officer of the State of New Jersey, crime went up 9 percent," she said. That set off such a vigorous side argument that Mr. Wallwork had to play the mediator, laughing boisterously and patting Mr. Edwards on the knee to calm him down.
Just hours before the debate, Mr. Wallwork unveiled a new one-minute radio advertisement assailing Mrs. Whitman.
 
Accusations of Contradictions
 "While Whitman's campaign continues to stumble over bad, liberal economic policy, hidden tax returns and illegal alien scandals, Jim Wallwork's campaign is surging," said the radio spot, which is to begin airing this week.
Mr. Edwards also announced a $50,000 radio ad campaign on New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City stations that attacks Mrs. Whitman.
"The radio ad campaign focuses on Christine Todd Whitman's hypocrisy, contradictions and flip-flops," said Jeffrey T. Michaels, campaign manager for Mr. Edwards.
"Her contradictions are not infrequent, isolated occurrences," Mr. Michaels said. "They have defined her entire candidacy. There are simply too many questions about her credibility for Republicans to trust her with the nomination for governor."
 
Whitman Confident of Lead
 Mrs. Whitman has at least a double-digit lead over either Mr. Wallwork, a businessman, and Mr. Edwards, a lawyer, according to their polls.
Confident of her lead, Mrs. Whitman's campaign has refused to respond to the barbs tossed out by her opponents as they try to sway the bloc of undecided, mostly conservative Republicans who are likely to control the outcome of the June 8 primary.
Instead, she has spent the four months since making her official announcement speaking to Republican groups, generally avoiding reporters and issuing policy papers on subjects from education to crime.
Republican leaders fear that if the primary season turns into a slugfest, their eventual nominee will head out damaged to do battle with the unpopular but still politically tough Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat who is seeking a second term.

HEADLINE: FIRST LADY SPEAKS TO WEST VIRGINIANS

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORGANTOWN, W.Va., May 11

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton gave a preview of the health-care campaign on television tonight, assuring West Virginians with an array of health-insurance problems that their concerns would be met when the Clinton Administration unveiled its proposals next month.
In a statewide town meeting conducted by satellite, Mrs. Clinton and one of the state's Democratic Senators, John D. Rockefeller 4th, quizzed a series of carefully selected West Virginians who typified the problems of the uninsured, of small businesses struggling to afford insurance and of hospitals and other providers trying to give care without reimbursement. 
 The theme that ran throughout the one-hour program, which was broadcast statewide and in parts of Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was that a crisis exists in the status quo and what Mrs. Clinton described as the "cost of doing nothing, of throwing up our hands and saying, Gosh, I don't think we can tackle something that complex."
 
No Mention of Taxes
 Mrs. Clinton, chairwoman of the task force on health care, did not address the costs of the changes believed to be favored by her planners, nor the various tax increases that are expected to be necessary. None of the West Virginians selected to appear, who ranged from an injured coal-industry worker to the head of the state Chamber of Commerce, touched these issues. The session was opened by Senator Rockefeller, long active on health care, and organized by West Virginia University, on whose campus it was held.
Despite the lack of fireworks, the session did give a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton's early sales pitch for a plan still in development. When the head of a small business talked of the difficulties in providing health insurance for his workers, Mrs. Clinton launched into an impassioned explanation of the complicated concept at the heart of the Clinton plan, the health-insurance purchasing cooperative.
"You'll be part of great big pools to buy insurance, and you'll get all the breaks and all the discounts that the big guys are entitled to," Mrs. Clinton told the businessman. "And people will not be denied insurance coverage because of their age or their pre-existing conditions. They'll be eligible for reasonably priced insurance because they're Americans."
At another point, Mrs. Clinton vowed that the Clinton plan would "streamline reimbursement, eliminate all these forms." And she also promised that the Administration would "measure everything we propose against the standard, what does it mean for patient care."
 
A State of Hard Times
 For all the choreography, there were several poignant moments that captured the toll of rising health-care costs in a state where unemployment stands at more than 11 percent, highest in the nation. Vicki McClung, whose husband is unemployed, talked of the worries of raising four children without health insurance and how she yearned to be able to give her children good preventive care.
"The way it stands right now, the ones on welfare are the ones who get to go and get their kids checked," she said.

HEADLINE: Panel Eases Employers' Tax on Domestic Workers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
The House Ways and Means Committee today kicked off the prickly task of writing President Clinton's economic program into law by giving some taxpayers a break: it voted to raise sharply, to $1,750 a year, the $50-a-quarter threshold that an employer can pay a domestic worker before becoming liable for Social Security taxes.
That was a belated bow to Zoe Baird, the Connecticut lawyer whom Mr. Clinton dropped as his choice for Attorney General after it was found that she had failed to pay taxes on the earnings of her chauffeur and nanny. The Internal Revenue Service says the changes approved today, if enacted, would benefit far more than the rich, affecting three million or more Americans who hire cooks, maids, sitters, gardeners and other household help. 
 It was, nevertheless, a thimbleful of sugar in what promises to be an ocean of medicine. By the time the panel finishes drafting Mr. Clinton's program into bill form, probably late this week, it will almost certainly have approved plans for some $300 billion in new or higher taxes on income, energy and business earnings
The domestic-worker rule, and the approval later of plans to spend more on child welfare, were the notable achievements of a day spent mostly on rote work and political labors.
 
'Supportive of the President'
 The panel's chairman, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, spent most of the afternoon with his committee's 23 Democrats, lining up support for the more dicey tax measures that he must steer past the Republican minority later in the week. The 14 Republicans, who will have virtually no say in the outcome, spent the afternoon plotting ways to frustrate him.
After the Democrats had met for several hours, Mr. Rostenkowski said, "To an individual, they want to be supportive of the President."
Other Democrats said that the essence of the Clinton tax plan -- higher tax rates on the wealthy, a new tax on fuel, taxes on more of the Social Security benefits of middle- and upper-income retirees and a big expansion of tax credits for the working poor -- would be approved. But they said some changes would be made on the edges.
The biggest debates, they said, were over how to reallocate the $30 billion that Mr. Clinton originally wanted for an investment tax credit to business and how to devise the fuel tax proposal in a way that would generate the most political support.
 
Corporate Tax Rate Question
 Mr. Rostenkowski said he would like to keep the corporate tax rate at no higher than 35 percent, but was not certain that could be accomplished. The rate is now 34 percent, and Mr. Clinton wants it raised to 36 percent.
Although the panel is working mostly on tax-code changes, lawmakers devoted most of their time today to a grab-bag of economic and trade issues that are also in the bill. Among the actions the panel took were these:
*It approved an Administration initiative to reduce the flood of children into foster homes by spending more to counsel troubled families and end child neglect and abuse. The $1.5 billion program is offset in part by $1.3 billion in spending cuts in other programs.
*It agreed to postpone for a year the effective date of a law passed under President Ronald Reagan that would require states to find jobs or job training for tens of thousands of married welfare recipients. The Clinton Administration had asked for a two-year postponement, contending that the welfare rolls would be pared more effectively if programs concentrated on finding jobs for single mothers.
*It adopted an amendment by Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, that would extend through 1998 a trial program in New York State that tries to keep families off welfare by increasing child-support collections.
 
Simplifying the Process
 The action today on domestic workers, if enacted, promises to vastly simplify the process of paying all taxes, state and Federal, on the household help now employed by at least three million American families.
The current law requires employers to pay Social Security taxes on any domestic worker who is paid more than $50 in a three-month period, a figure that has not been adjusted since the law was passed in 1950. Critics say that under the law as it stands, millions of taxpayers should file quarterly returns to cover taxes on teen-agers who mow their lawns or baby-sit.
The Internal Revenue Service says that 733,000 employers do file such quarterly returns on their household workers, but that about 2.2 million other employers are ignoring the law.
The changes adopted by the Ways and Means Committee, on a voice vote, raise the $50-a-quarter threshold to $1,750 a year this year and $1,800 in 1994, with adjustments for inflation thereafter. Employers paying less than that would not be required to pay any Social Security taxes on their workers.
The $1,750 figure, aides said, roughly accounts for the effect of inflation in the 43 years since the law was passed. In a gesture to employers who have avoided the tax and are either caught or decide to make amends, the committee voted to apply the threshold retroactively, adjusted for inflation, back to 1950.
While the changes benefit employers, they are potentially less helpful to the domestic workers themselves, who could find it harder to gain eligibility for Social Security or could see their retirement benefits reduced.
Under the law, workers receive credit for three months worked every time they earn $560, up to four times a year. The law requires at least 40 such quarters over a life's work before a worker can become eligible for retirement or disability benefits.
Under the new reporting requirements, the I.R.S. estimates, 16 percent of the nation's domestics would lose at least one quarter of earnings credit because they fall beneath the new reporting threshold.
Other amendments adopted today could wipe out much of the paperwork for employers, who now must pay Social Security and state and Federal unemployment taxes each quarter.
The changes would permit employers to pay Social Security obligations on household help each April 15, as part of their annual 1040 tax filing, and to avoid paying a lump sum by having the taxes deducted from their paychecks. It would allow the same arrangement for paying Federal unemployment taxes, which are required for any domestic earning more than $1,000 a quarter.

HEADLINE: Dow, in Closing Surge, Ends 25.47 Higher

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In a reversal of Monday's trading, the stock market languished in near-torpor for most of yesterday's session but surged strongly in the last half- hour.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had climbed as much as 26 points late in the day, closed up 25.47 points, to 3,468.75. All other major indexes were up in relatively moderate trading. 
 Yesterday's Treasury auction of $16 billion in three-year notes -- the first of three big Treasury sales this week -- provided investors with an excuse to take a wait-and-see attitude, analysts said, and accounted for the relatively tranquil trading in the morning and early afternoon.
But when results of the sales after 1 P.M. showed interest rates at the auction were at the expected low range, traders were encouraged to look again at stocks for investments. Computerized buy programs helped accelerate the stock rally in the last few minutes of the session.
The two remaining Treasury auctions, for longer-term securities, are considered more significant by analysts for their possible effect on the stock market.
Gold prices, closely watched in recent days, drifted upward yesterday but most gold stocks were down or up only modestly. Newmont Mining, which helped spark investor interest in gold last month, closed down 1/8, to 47 3/4. A Financial Times report said that Sir James Goldsmith had sold a 9.5 percent stake.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index closed up 0.85 point, to 245.88, and trading volume totaled 221.6 million shares, compared with 235.6 million shares Monday. Winning stocks on the Big Board outnumbered decliners, 1,053 to 856.
The Standard & Poor's 500 was up 1.56 point, to 444.36 and the Nasdaq composite index was up 0.24 point, to 683.06. The American Stock Exchange market value index was up 0.56 point, to 427.25.
For the most part, stock watchers saw nothing new in the market's activity yesterday. Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers Inc. said, "It's striking that we've had a long string of relatively high-volume, 200-million-plus shares a day, and no real price movement for much of the session for each of those days."
He added, "The market is basically waiting for some breakout -- the economy catching fire, which would spark a major rally, or interest rates dropping sharply, which would scare the market because that would mean the economy was dropping sharply, too."
The Dow Jones transportation average, volatile for weeks now, closed up 0.61 point, to 1,570.48. The average was lifted by Federal Express , up 1 1/8, to 49 1/8, on no discernible news, and Consolidated Railroad, up 7/8, to 52 3/8, on upbeat analyst comments on the rail industry.
The Dow was mainly lifted by seven stocks that gained 1 point or more. These stocks lifted the blue-chip index by nearly 19 points of the 25-point rise. The stocks were led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and J .P. Morgan. 3M was up 1 7/8, to 114 1/8, on upbeat comments by the chairman at the annual meeting. J. P. Morgan was up 1 1/4, to 68 3/8, on no discernible news.
The two most active stocks on the Big Board were tobacco stocks. The industry leader Philip Morris was down 1 1/4, to 51 1/2, and No. 2 RJR Nabisco was up 1/4, to 6, on news of price increases for some Philip Morris deep-discount cigarettes. Analysts say the price changes indicated no backing away from an expected price war.
Also noteworthy were the semiconductor stocks, which declined, especially Intel, which was down 3 points, to 99 1/2. An industry group reported that demand for semiconductors eased in April.

HEADLINE: U.S. SET TO CHANGE ABORTION POLICIES

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 11

 BODY:
Declaring that it wanted to help lead a new global effort to address the issue of overpopulation, the Clinton Administration said today that efforts to stabilize world population growth must concentrate on providing more opportunities and rights for women, including abortions.
In a speech to a United Nations committee that is planning a major conference on population in Cairo next year, Timothy E. Wirth, the State Department Counselor, said the Administration intended to reverse policies on population growth that had been adopted under Presidents Reagan and Bush. 
 Under the two Republican Presidents the United States refused to finance international population programs that provided women with counseling on abortion. In addition, in Mr. Reagan's term, the United States took the position that population growth was a "neutral phenomenon" -- neither harmful nor beneficial to the environment -- and that the important issue was economic development.
 
A Question of Choice
 In a previous United Nations population conference held in 1974 in Bucharest, Romania, and in 1984 in Mexico City, the issue of abortion was played down. Some population experts say that out of deference to Catholic countries and some Muslim nations, they do not expect next year's gathering to approve a strongly worded statement asserting a woman's right to an abortion. Still Mr. Wirth said the United States would push for it.
"The U.S. Government would be remiss if it did not develop recommendations and guidance with regard to abortion," Mr. Wirth said. "Our position is to support reproductive choice, including access to safe abortion."
Population experts say about 125,000 women die each year -- about one-fourth of all maternal deaths -- as a result of improperly performed abortions. Almost all of these deaths occur in developing countries.
In outlining Administration policy for the first time in a forum devoted to population issues, Mr. Wirth made clear how dramatic a change the Clinton Administration was making in the area of population stabilization.
 
President 'Deeply Committed'
 "President Clinton is deeply committed to moving population to the forefront of America's international priorities," Mr. Wirth said. "He understands the cost of excessive population growth to the health of women, to the natural environment and to our hopes for alleviating poverty. He believes that America cannot stand aside as the world confronts one of the largest challenges of this century and the next."
Mr. Wirth also put the Clinton Administration on record endorsing other ideas in the population and development field that were anathama to the Reagan and Bush Administrations, like agreeing with developing countries that that Western nations should limit their consumption.
For the first time, Mr. Wirth officially confirmed that the Administration would resume financing for the United Nations Population Fund. Congress cut off funds to the organization after reports that it financed family planning efforts in China that entailed coercive abortions and forced sterilization.
The American official did not say how much the Administration would seek for the United Nations Population Fund, though he did mention that the Administration has asked for a $100 million increase for population programs in the Federal budget for the year ending Sept. 30, 1994.
 
A Tumultuous Response
 Mr. Wirth's speech received a tumultuous response from some of the delegations, and from many of the representatives of non-governmental organizations -- women's groups, and environmental and population specialists -- who listened from the gallery as he addressed the delegations to the Preparatory Committee. "As one of those who had to struggle within the old U.S. policy it is like a breath of fresh air," Fred Sai of Ghana, chairman of the Preparatory Committee, said.
But anti-abortion groups, denounced the Administration's reversal of American policy. "It's outrageous, in a word," said Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who heads the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus. "The U.N. Population Plan of Action of 1984 that was adopted in Mexico City made it very clear that abortion was not to be construed as a method of family planning."
 
Public Financing Weighed
 Published reports have said Mr. Clinton is considering public financing of abortions as part of his health care package. The Administration has overturned the Reagan Administration's policy that barred United States funds from international population groups involved in providing women with information on abortions.
Archbishop Renato R. Martino, the head of the delegation from the Vatican, declined to comment on the American delegate's speech.
The representatives of the nongovernmental organizations who generally occupy the liberal end of the political spectrum and who opposed the Reagan-Bush policies, erupted into applause at the end of Mr. Wirth's address, a marked contrast to the polite silence that often greeted the remarks by delegates from other countries.
After the speech some women in the gallery punched their fists into the air, and some wept.

HEADLINE: Business Schools Hit Hard Times Amid Doubt Over Value of M.B.A.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
After two decades of growth so robust that they could just sit back and welcome waves of students year after year, the nation's business schools have hit hard times as more students wonder whether an M.B.A. is worth the time and expense.
Over the 1980's, the number of masters' degrees in business administration awarded at the nation's 680 business schools grew about 15 percent. Then came the recession and the much-publicized shrinking of corporate payrolls. 
 Since 1990, the number of M.B.A.'s has slipped about 3 percent, to 75,000, and no one expects an increase anytime soon. The number of students taking the Graduate Management Admission Test, the standard business-school entrance exam, has fallen even more sharply -- 6 percent from 1991 to 1992, with a steeper decline expected this year.
"There's a growing realization that an M.B.A. is not a ticket to the gravy train," said Charles Hickman, director of projects and services for the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business in St. Louis, which accredits graduate schools of business. "Having said that, I'm not ready to write the obituary for M.B.A.'s. But the good times are over."
 
Growth at Other Schools
 The fortunes of business schools contrast sharply with those of other graduate and professional schools. Although current figures have not yet been compiled, experts who track enrollment patterns say more students are staying in school to wait out the aftereffects of the recession. Among the major fields of study, only law schools are showing a similar decline in enrollment, although not as pronounced as business schools'.
The signs of shrinking interest are everywhere, from Stanford to the University of Texas to Gannon University in Erie, Pa. Of a dozen business schools sampled, only Harvard's showed a substantial increase in applications, to 5,930 for the 1993-94 academic year from 5,714 this year.
At Duke University, the admissions office says it expects applications to drop this year to 2,100 or 2,200, off from last year's total of 2,300. At the University of Texas, applications slipped by 17 this year, remaining in the low 3,000 range. And at the University of Michigan, applications have tumbled to 2,700 this spring from 2,899 a year ago.
Business schools are trying an array of new tactics to counter this trend. Texas, for example, established a 24-hour toll-free telephone line this year for prospective students. At Kent State University in Ohio, the business school hired a marketing firm for the first time to produce a glossy brochure promoting its business school.
 
Reaching Out to People
 "This is unheard of," said Richard E. Brown, assistant dean for graduate education at Kent State's Graduate School of Management. "Used to be, we'd sit around and let the good students come in. Now you have to identify niches and let people know what you can do for them."
And Mr. Hickman, of the business school accreditation organization, warns that those who fail to adjust to leaner times could find themselves out of business. "It's not going to happen this year," he said. "But it won't take too many years of seeing reductions of 10 percent or so before we begin to see some schools close."
It was not always this way. For years, the "B-school" could do little wrong, as colleges and universities watched applications and enrollments in business schools increase at a healthy clip.
Even small players like Gannon University established M.B.A. programs 20 years ago to reap the rich harvest of tuition dollars. The number of M.B.A. programs surged to its current level of 680, almost double the 389 institutions offering M.B.A.'s in 1974.
 
Wall Street Wealth Cited
 The Wall Street boom in the 1980's only quickened the growth. The halcyon years of American business lured students like Jeff McGee, who attended Dartmouth College's business school from 1987 to 1989, when the nation's business climate began to sour.
"There was so much wealth on Wall Street in the 80's, it just sucked people in," said Mr. McGee, 32, who now works in finance for a New York City consumer products concern. "It's been a rough couple of years, but I think for me it's really beginning to kick in. My credentials really helped."
Now students like Tracy Ott, a 24-year-old marketing consultant in New York City, are posing questions that a decade ago would have sounded like heresy.
"There is a question of whether going to business school is a good investment," said Ms. Ott, who is deciding whether to go full time to New York University's business school, where she is now a part-time student. "The big question I have is, are M.B.A.'s really teaching what students need for the 90's?"
By and large, the answer is yes -- but only because corporations are demanding better trained students from business schools, which are scrambling to reconfigure curriculums from general business courses to more specialties and electives. But the updating of curriculums also reflects an effort by schools to distinguish themselves from competitors.
The University of South Carolina, for example, has transformed its business school into one of the top three in the nation in international business, Mr. Hickman said.
The same can be said for the University of Tennessee, whose business school has carved out a niche in the area of personnel management. And as demand for an M.B.A. wanes, even universities like Harvard and Columbia are beginning to realize that they cannot passively trade on their names anymore.
Harvard, for example, is recruiting more aggressively in Miami and San Juan, P.R., to increase its Hispanic enrollment. At Columbia, recruiting swings now include trips to Hong Kong and cities in Japan. The curriculum has been revamped to emphasize international affairs, and the school now admits students three times a year to its program. Blurring the traditional academic year, which few other major business schools have done, has helped encourage more applications.
"In today's marketplace, you have to have a sense of focus and you have to have unique advantages," said Ethan Hanabury, the assistant dean of admissions at Columbia's business school. "We're trying to put our best foot forward."
Colleges and universities that do not have Ivy League appeal go to even greater lengths to attract students to their business schools.
At Kent State, business school officials and students wrote letters and telephoned Julie Valentine two years ago in an effort to persuade her to attend the university. Ms. Valentine, now 24, had just completed her undergraduate degree at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., when she applied to and was accepted by Kent State, Rutgers University and Clark Atlanta University.
Kent State's personal touch ultimately won.
"Kent was much more aggressive than the other institutions," said Ms. Valentine, who is completing an M.B.A. in finance. "Whenever I called, they recognized my name and they knew who I was. They'd say: 'Oh, Julie, hi. How are you?' They remembered little things about me, and that didn't stop once I arrived."
 
Geared to Local Workers
 For business schools at little-known institutions like Gannon, the future looks more foreboding. The program is entirely part time, and enrollment is heavily geared to local workers whose companies pay tuition.
The university now has 900 students in its business school, down from the 1,000 a decade ago. But Betty Jo Licata, the business school dean, sounding as optimistic as other business school deans, says she is not worried about national trends.
"Unlike Harvard or Northwestern, we serve local interests," she said, adding that layoffs at local companies affect enrollment significantly. "I'm more concerned about our local economy."
Like many places in the United States, the economy has not been purring in Erie. So Gannon expanded its recruiting trips this year, not to foreign cities or even to major American cities, but to a company just three blocks from its campus.
"Instead of expecting people to come to us," Dean Licata said, "we're going to them."
At a cost of $7,000 to $10,000 a year in tuition alone for a typical two-year M.B.A. program at a state university like Texas, to nearly $20,000 in tuition at institutions like Harvard, the cost has remained relatively stable despite the heated competition for students, business school officials at colleges and universities say.
But the return on that investment seems to be diminishing. Business school placement offices say their job is getting much tougher. In a meeting last summer of job placement officials at the 40 largest M.B.A. programs, most officials said job offers and salaries in the $50,000-a-year range to students who graduate from the programs were holding steady.
But Mr. Hickman, of the business school accreditation group, said: "It is apparent that the rules for career services and placement are changing. Schools and graduates are going to have to work a lot harder to place students."

HEADLINE: Factory Raid Nets 45 Arrests and a Million T-Shirts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
As part of a drive against illegal street vending, the Dinkins administration announced yesterday that the police had arrested 45 people and seized more than a million imitation designer T-shirts from manufacturing operations housed in a Manhattan building.
Police officials said they believed it was the largest such T-shirt counterfeiting operation in the city. 
 Yesterday's action was the latest move in an effort by City Hall to pacify small-business owners, who have complained bitterly about the proliferation of street vendors who operate illegally. The presence of an estimated 10,000 illegal vendors in the city has become a heated political and economic issue, as some major streets have become congested with street merchants.
At a City Hall news conference, Mayor David N. Dinkins made the announcement while standing next to a large table filled with colorful, illegally manufactured T-shirts bearing the logos of companies like Champion, Nike and Guess and sports teams like the New York Knicks. Standing with Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and Wallace Ford, Commissioner of the city's Department of Business Services, the Mayor said the city would step up its efforts against illegally produced goods.
"We had envisioned from the outset that our enforcement efforts under this program would include measures directed against the organized illegal suppliers of street vendors," Mr. Dinkins said. "Selling illegal merchandise on our city's streets cannot be sanctioned and will not be tolerated."
Yesterday's arrests and confiscation involved an operation on four floors of a commercial building at 1165 Broadway, at West 27th Street, police officials said. The Mayor said the action came after a monthlong investigation. Search warrants were issued by a State Supreme Court Judge, and another judge signed an order of attachment for the operation, the first step in forfeiture proceedings.
The five-story building housed 38 manufacturers of the shirts operating in close quarters, police inspectors said. They added that the operations employed about 100 workers.
 
'Target Wholesalers'
 Police officials said they had confiscated two tractor-trailer loads of clothing manufactured at the Broadway operation that illegally used trademarked labels. But they said they had not assessed the street value of the merchandise.
"We will continue to target wholesalers of counterfeit merchandise in order to protect consumers," Mr. Dinkins said, adding that he intended to send a message to vendors that "our city's business environment does not include the sale of illegal merchandise."
The police said that only managers had been arrested, not laborers. The managers were charged with possession of and offering for sale counterfeit goods with a value in excess of $1,000.
Just a month ago Mr. Dinkins said the city would intensify its efforts to crack down on illegal vendors by assigning 36 additional police officers to the 46-member peddler enforcement unit and by deploying 31 more city inspectors. The Mayor's efforts come in an election year in which Mr. Dinkins has undertaken several initiatives aimed at gaining the support of small business owners.
Mr. Ford, who along with Commissioner Kelly heads the Mayor's month-old Vendor Policy Group, estimated that illegal vendors deprive the city of about $300 million annually in sales taxes.

HEADLINE: In Hartford, The Budget Is Passed And Signed

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 11

 BODY:
The Connecticut General Assembly, after stumbling last week in its effort to pass a budget a month ahead of the deadline, gave final approval today to an $8.58 billion spending plan for the year that begins July 1.
The budget, which was immediately signed into law by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., restores most of the cuts in welfare and other social programs that Mr. Weicker proposed earlier this year, and does so without major tax increases, because existing taxes are generating more revenue than expected. 
 "It's a good budget," Mr. Weicker said in a brief signing ceremony in his office just after 5 P.M. He then bent down to sign the document and said, "Done."
"And it's daylight out," said House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, a Hartford Democrat.
 
Democrats' Muted Joy
 For the Democrats, who control both chambers of the General Assembly, however, the joy at avoiding the last-day-of-the-session frenzy was clearly muted. Leaders had hoped to have the budget wrapped up last week, a month before the June 9 adjournment, only to see the momentum halted in the Senate when state labor union leaders objected to a provision that would have eliminated automatic pay raises for many state employees.
The Senate amended the offending article, voting to phase out the automatic raises beginning next Jan. 1, and it was that amended budget that the House passed today on a largely party-line vote, 87 to 62.
But the give-and-take with the unions, in addition to stalling the budget, gave the Republicans a target that could not be resisted: Labor had said jump, the Republicans said over and over again in the three-and-a-half-hour debate, and the Democrats had responded, How high?
 
'I'm Embarrassed'
 "I'm embarrassed, everyone should be embarrassed," said Representative Andrew McCall Norton, a Colchester Republican. "The public sees a General Assembly that seems to be in control of a special interest."
"The word I've heard is unconscionable," said Representative Claudia Powers, a Republican from Greenwich.
Democrats, in response, noted that the labor unions were unhappy with the compromise worked out in the Senate and were lobbying today to try to scuttle the budget in the House. The Republicans, in voting no on the budget, were thus the real supporters of labor's position, the Democrats said.
"I'm not embarrassed," said Representative Michael J. Jarjura, a Democrat from Waterbury. "I'm shocked and dismayed at what I hear coming from the other side of the aisle."
 
Little Pain, Some Gain
 People in both parties said that the major reason for an early finish for the budget was that it did not involve great pain or sacrifice. Mr. Weicker said in February that balancing the budget this year, as the recession continued, would mean $180 million in new and higher taxes and deep spending cuts for things like welfare and medical prescription subsidies for the elderly.
Governor Weicker suggested, for example, that any person on general-assistance welfare considered employable by state examiners be evicted from the program, which would have thrown an estimated 22,000 people off the welfare rolls on July 1. The new budget maintains Mr. Weicker's two-tier system of employable and nonemployable needy and cuts the benefits of the employables from the current $314 a month to $300. But no one will be excluded.
Mr. Weicker had also proposed creating an assets test in giving prescription aid to the elderly, narrowing the program to the poor, a proposal that provoked howls from advocates for the aged. Almost all the proposed $14 million in cuts proposed by the Governor were restored, with no questions about assets.
 
The New 2-Year Plan
 The budget was the first one prepared under a rolling two-year budget law passed last year. It provides for a $9 billion budget for the year that begins July 1, 1994, but the goal is mainly to provide a spending and tax target for the next legislative session, since the 1994 budget will have to be passed all over again as part of next year's two-year plan.
Republicans, who proposed spending cuts of $161 million in an amendment on the floor -- an amendment rejected on a party-line vote -- tweaked the Democrats one last time in the final moments of the debate. If the budget had been passed on its original timetable last week, they said, the Democrats would have passed the earliest budget in recent memory. The delay, however, keeps that distinction with the Republicans, who passed a budget on May 9, 1985, when they were in the majority, said the House minority leader, Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., a Republican from Bristol.

GOVERNOR'S PLAN: More than $150 million in additional taxes, including a 5-cents-a-bottle tax on beer, soda and other beverages.
LEGISLATURE'S PLAN: $7.5 million in additional taxes, mainly higher taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, and automobile tires. The Legislature also cut some taxes by expanding the number of purchases exempt from the sales tax and a $2 million cut in corporate taxes.
 
GOVERNOR'S PLAN: Would have cut 22,000 people from general assistance welfare if considered employable and would have cut $19 million form nursing home reimbursements.
LEGISLATURE'S PLAN: Maintains welfare rolls, but cuts benefits of employable poor to $300 a month, from $314. Reduces nursing home reimbursements by $2 million.

U.N. of Pit Crews Revs For Old Brooklyn Poly

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman

 BODY:
REMEMBER the 1969 Mets, Harry S. Truman in 1948, David? Well, slingshot, longshot and underdog fans, meet the car racing team from Brooklyn Polytechnic University.
Brooklyn Polytechnic is a no-frills school. It does not have dormitories or a gymnasium and few of the 4,000 students seem to know that the school's nickname is the Blue Jays. The students, many of them foreign born or the children of immigrants, come to the downtown Brooklyn buildings, study hard, become engineers and get good jobs. There is not much rah-rah. 
 But now, Brooklyn Poly has a student-built, scaled-down Formula One racing car ready to compete against entries from better-heeled schools in the Society of Automotive Engineers competition to be held near Detroit at the end of May. Building such a car is an expensive and time-consuming undertaking, and for Brooklyn Poly it has been a little like having the Dead End Kids preparing for a fox hunt.
"You have to realize that Brooklyn Polytechnical is a very tough school," said Minh Duong, a 19-year-old sophomore who is the elected president of the car building group. "Nobody lives on campus. All of us commute. Most of us have to work at jobs in addition to our course work."
"There's not much room for social life," Mr. Duong said. "For the last year this has been our social life," he said, gesturing to the 10-foot-long tubular car in the center of a basement workshop. "Many nights we've slept here."
As Mr. Duong spoke, Andres Matias, also 19, was taking off the car's front wheels. "We have to do it so that we can get it through the doors into the parking lot," said Mr. Matias, who was to be the first driver on the first test run. Meanwhile, the car's other builders were drifting in: James Wong, who was originally from Malaysia; Miguel Pires from Portugal; Meijiao Sara Chen from China. Mr. Matias was born and finished high school in Puerto Rico while Mr. Duong came to New York 11 years ago from Vietnam along with his parents, two older sisters and a younger brother. Of the basic core group only Stacy Genovese from Howard Beach has a car of her own.
"We've had people from all over working together," said Mr. Matias, "Pakistan, the Caribbean, the Middle East. We've had men, women, about 40 people altogether, though only about 15 worked on it regularly."
Four of the students were struggling to wiggle the 400-pound car past the door frames. Dominick Rivera, a powerful sophomore, was holding up the front end as Mark Rodrigues angled the back through the opening. Then they wheeled it onto an elevator and down to a loading dock. There, in an efficient application of the physics of simple machines, they hooked the car onto a hydraulic crane and lowered it from the four-foot ledge.
"Our idea is to drive it in a way that will break things," said Mr. Matias.
"We want to anticipate what could go wrong," said Mr. Duong, adding that a year ago, when Brooklyn Polytechnical sent its first car to the competition, the team was left crushed by a faulty drive train.
"We had done real well in the first two days of technical inspections and tests," said Mr. Duong, who was there as a freshman. "We were up there holding our own with Cornell and R.P.I. -- but then, just before the key 70-mile time trials, the drive train broke. We didn't have spare parts or money to buy anything, and anyway it was a Sunday and everything was closed. It was pretty sad, but all we could do is watch the others."
This year, he predicted, will be different, largely because the group has received $25,000 from Roger Penske, the sponsor of a professional racing team who heads companies selling automotive products. The contribution more than doubled the meager funds that the students managed to come up with last year, though it reportedly still left them with less to work with than most of the competing schools. When a single racing tire costs $500 and it takes $6,000 to transport the car and its builders to Detroit for three days, even the new, more generous budget required careful economizing.
Now Mr. Matias, dressed in fireproof driver's suit and helmet, strapped himself into the car. He hit the ignition and the 600-cubic-centimeter Yamaha engine roared. Mr. Rodrigues tinkered with the carburetor until he got the right pitch. Mr. Matias put the car into the first of six forward gears. And then a cable on the clutch pedal snapped.
Mr. Duong used baling wire for temporary repairs. For the next four hours the students kept the engine going while they tinkered and gauged performance. They never got out of first gear. They spotted a tiny crack on the critical drive train that would have to be welded. No one seemed alarmed.
"No problem -- we'll be ready in Detroit," said Mr. Duong, hinting at an upset victory for Brooklyn Poly, poly as in polyglot.

Good Demand at Treasury Auction

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Treasury's quarterly auction got off to a respectable start yesterday with the sale of $16 billion in three-year notes.
Traders said there was good demand at the auction, with buying by retail and institutional investors as well as bond dealers. Yields at the auction averaged 4.27 percent on the notes, the lowest since three-year notes were first regularly issued in 1978. 
 But some traders said they were still unsure about the outlook for the two other auctions this week, $10.75 billion of 10-year notes today and $8.25 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow. And the inflation data to be released today and tomorrow could hold some surprises that would make these auctions more difficult.
 
 
Little Room for a Rally
 With the two auctions still overhanging the market and the inflation data to come, there was little room for a rally after the auction results came out in the early afternoon. So in late trading, prices of Treasury bonds and notes were little changed on the day. The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 104 with the yield at 6.81 percent.
In the when-issued, or pre-auction, market, the yield on the 10-year note for sale today was 5.88 percent, unchanged from Monday and the yield on the 30-year bond to be sold Thursday was also unchanged at 6.81 percent.
Daniel Callahan, the managing director in charge of Government trading at Paine Webber, said he expected the 10-year note auction to go well. He said that apparently many dealers had already sold 10-year notes to customers in anticipation of the sale and therefore would bid to get the new securities at the auction.
He also said the Treasury's decision last week to eliminate the 7-year note would send some buyers to the 10-year note as an alternative.
But he said the Government's reports on the Producer Price Index today and the Consumer Price index tomorrow would set the tone for the 30-year bond auction.
 
 
Surprises Possible
 Michael H. Strauss, the chief economist at Yamaichi International, said there could be some surprises in the inflation data, especially in the producer price report, that could cause trouble for the 10-year note and the 30-year bond auctions.
He said many analysts were expecting the inflation increase for April to be low because of price-cutting in the tobacco industry. But he said the tobacco price war could have less effect on inflation than the bond market expected.
He also suggested that inflation in April could be higher than expected as a result of higher food prices because of the bad weather in March and a jump in natural gas prices. He is forecasting a three-tenths to four-tenths of one percentage point increase in producer prices.
But he said that if the full effect of higher natural gas prices was reflected, the increase could be six-tenths of one percentage point. Such an increase would be disturbing to traders and investors, who have come to expect low and steady inflation.
The consensus forecast for the Producer Price Index among a broad group of economists is an increase of two-tenths of a percentage point, according to Bloomberg Business News.
Mr. Strauss is predicting that the Consumer Price Index will rise by about three-tenths of one percentage point, which is also higher than the consensus outlook for this index, which is two-tenths of one percentage point.
Along with the consumer prices report tomorrow, the Government will release the April report on retail sales, which fell 1 percent in March. If retail sales post a strong rebound, then any unexpected inflation increase will be even more worrisome for the bond market because a growing economy makes traders worry about rising prices.
At the three-year note auction yesterday, the signs that it went well included the performance after the auction was over. In late trading in the when-issued market, the yield on the new three-year note, which has a coupon of 4.25 percent, was at 4.24 percent, down from the average of 4.27 percent at the auction. This means there was good buying later in the day.
Mr. Callahan of Paine Webber said there was good demand for several reasons. One is that there are many portfolio managers with plenty of cash to invest. Another is that the three-year note with a yield of 4.24 percent is a safe place to put money at a time when the outlook for the economy and the future of President Clinton's economic program is mixed.
"Anyone who is confused would be happy to get a 4.25 percent yield until the picture is less cloudy," he said. The 10-year note and the 30-year bond are less attractive because their longer maturities makes their prices more volatile and more vulnerable to a quick shift in market sentiment.
Following are the results of yesterday's three-year note auction:

Dollar Is Lower on Report Of Weak U.S. Retail Sales

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar slipped in thin trading yesterday after a private report showed weakness in American retail sales, dimming traders' hopes for upbeat news about the economy.
Gold prices edged up slightly in New York after slipping overseas. Gold for current delivery rose 10 cents, to $356.70 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. 
 A report by the Johnson Redbook Service said adjusted retail sales rose just three-tenths of 1 percent in the first week of May. That was far below the 1.2 percent rise that economists expect for April in a Government report scheduled for tomorrow.
 "The report was quite a big blow and is causing a bit of a panic," said Dave Glowacki, senior trader at the NBD Bank.
 
 
Southeast Asian Buying
 Dealers were also disappointed at the dollar's stubborn refusal to move higher despite early rumors of speculative buying by a Southeast Asian central bank and other accounts.
 "The more the dollar doesn't go up, the more traders figure it should go down," Mr. Glowacki said. "The market has to move for traders to make money."
 The British pound rallied on a 300 million purchase in the Far East, dealers said. A 22 percent rise in British housing construction in the first quarter also improved sterling's outlook.
 The pound rose to $1.5421 in New York, from $1.5320 late Monday. Earlier in London, the pound traded at $1.5420, up from $1.5340 Monday. Meanwhile, the dollar fell to 1.6065 German marks in New York, from 1.6088 marks Monday.
The dollar also lost ground against the Japanese yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 111.34 yen in late dealings, down from 111.78 yen Monday. It closed in Tokyo at 111.35 yen, up from 110.27 yen late Monday.

Moody's Gives Junk Rating To $4.6 Billion of Delta Debt

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The rating on about $4.6 billion of long-term debt of Delta Air Lines was lowered to junk bond status yesterday by Moody's Investors Service Inc., which is concerned about the operating performance and cash flow of the No. 3 domestic airline.
"While Delta's proportionate share of international revenue to total revenues is not as large as other U.S. competitors," Moody's said, "Delta's international activities are heavily reliant on flying to Europe." 
 Moody's noted that the airline's European operations accounted for about 75 percent of its international business, which represented about 25 percent of the carrier's systemwide revenue.
The agency said it expected Delta's short-term profitability to suffer because of the weak economy in much of Europe. That will be especially true in Germany, where the airline's costly hub in Frankfurt is likely to have lower revenues over the intermediate term, though it has excellent long-term potential, Moody's added.
The rating agency lowered Delta's senior unsecured debt and industrial revenue bond rating to Ba-1 from Baa-3.
In March, the Standard & Poor's Corporation, another big debt rating agency, lowered to junk level the rating on $21.4 billion of debt owed by Delta; the UAL Corporation, owner of United Airlines, and the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines.
Over all, the long-term profitability of Delta heavily depends on the completion of big cost savings and fewer fare wars, Moody's said. But in Moody's view, both will be difficult in light of the continuing negotiations with the pilots' union and the highly competitive atmosphere among domestic and foreign airlines.

HEADLINE: 7 Deadly Sins of Living Linked To Illness as Well as Mortality

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
As if he were a medieval artist depicting the depravity of the seven deadly sins, Dr. Lester Breslow, a California public health specialist, has created a solemn portrait of self-destruction. The weapons are seven unwholesome habits he first identified more than a quarter-century ago.
By following the fates of nearly 7,000 adults living in California's Alameda County over three decades, he proved that the more of these poor health habits people practiced in 1965, the greater their chances were of dying within 10 years. 
 And now his latest study shows that even fewer people than thought escape the ravages of their health "sins." In a study conducted with his son Norman, a statistician at the University of Washington in Seattle, Dr. Breslow has shown that the unhealthy habits portend not only early death for many but chronic and costly disabilities for those who survive.
 
Predictors of Early Death
 Two of the poor health practices, as Dr. Breslow calls them, obesity and physical inactivity, are reminiscent of the ancient sins of gluttony and sloth. The others include both the predictable -- smoking and drinking too much alcohol, and the surprising -- sleeping too much or too little, eating between meals and skipping breakfast. Based on studies he and others did in the 1960's, Dr. Breslow singled out these seven things as likely to predict an early death.
His first Alameda County report revealed in 1972 that in combination these poor health practices could double a person's chance of dying prematurely. Now, in his latest paper, published in a recent issue of the journal Preventive Medicine, Dr. Breslow reports that even when the practices do not lead to an early death, they increase the risk that a person will suffer one or more physical or medical limitations that can degrade the later years of life.
Their study found that those Californians whose lives in 1965 were characterized by six or seven of the poor health practices were twice as likely to be disabled 10 or more years later as were their neighbors with no more than two of these habits.
Even without taking age or initial health status into account, among those with no poor health habits or just one, 12.2 percent were disabled, and for those with two or three poor health habits, 14.1 percent were disabled. In contrast, 18.7 percent of those with four or more poor health habits were disabled.
Dr. Jonathan Fielding, chairman of the board of the nonprofit California Wellness Foundation and chief health-policy planner for Johnson & Johnson, said Dr. Breslow's newest study was "critically important" at a time when the nation is trying to revamp its approach to health care.
"The results really say that how you live determines how long you will live without your state of health interfering with the things you want to do or forcing you to make changes in your life to accommodate your health problems," he said in a telephone interview.
 
Priorities Are Questioned
 The Breslows' findings underscore a theme that public health specialists have been promoting for decades to a nation that has listened with less than half an ear: preventive health practices are important not only in decreasing premature deaths but also in reducing costly debilitating illnesses. Dr. Breslow fears that current efforts to overhaul the health-care system put the cart before the horse by focusing on crisis medicine.
"It's a gross mistake to call what is being attempted now by the Clinton Administration health-care reform," Dr. Breslow said in a recent interview. "It is medical-care reform. To reform health care, we have to address how health can be maintained apart from medical services.
"There are indications that the Clinton Administration is aware of this, but the issue is not yet being tackled as an integral part of the reform effort."
Dr. Fielding said economic incentives for companies, health maintenance organizations and individuals would be needed to goad them into fostering and practicing preventive medicine.
Dr. Breslow, a professor emeritus at the School of Public Health of the University of California at Los Angeles, is perhaps his own best advertisement for the merits of disease prevention. Noting that he has avoided all seven of the poor health practices for most of his life, the 78-year-old researcher, who retired in 1980, said he worked "only eight days a week." He also swims, continues to eat sensibly and maintains a normal weight.
"With people of the United States now living typically into their 70's and 80's, the personal and social importance of maintaining health into the later years is mounting," the Breslows wrote. "People are increasingly concerned about how to avoid disability during their longer lives."
 
A Disturbing Trend
 But are people concerned enough to make changes in the living habits that undermine their chances of continued good health? And can young people be enticed to lead "cleaner" lives when the wages of their health sins may not be exacted until decades later?
According to the latest survey of American health practices, the decades-long trend toward healthier living habits has taken a turn for the worse. In December, Louis Harris & Associates polled 1,251 randomly selected adults in a survey by telephone conducted for Baxter International, a Michigan producer of health-care products and services. The survey included many of the same questions the Harris poll takers have been asking every year for a decade.
The 1992 survey showed that compared with the findings in 1991 or, say, 1983, more Americans were overweight and they were eating less carefully, exercising less and getting less sleep. Last year, 66 percent of Americans were found to be overweight, up from 63 percent in 1991 and 58 percent in 1983. Only 33 percent said they exercised vigorously three or more times a week, down from 37 percent the year before. Fewer of those questioned were "trying hard" to eat less cholesterol, fat and sodium and to eat more fiber than in 1991.
And, as an indication that their lives had become more stressful, last year only 50 percent of respondents said they got as much as seven to eight hours of sleep a night, down from 64 percent in 1983.
"These survey results represent disturbing trends in the nation's health behaviors," concluded Dr. James S. Todd, executive director of the American Medical Association, a traditionally conservative organization that has belatedly jumped on the preventive-medicine bandwagon.
But for some of the health practices Dr. Breslow has been studying, the survey findings were encouraging. Cigarette smoking, the nation's single most damaging and costly habit in terms of health, was practiced by only 24 percent of adult Americans, and 70 percent of them said they wanted to quit. In the 1960's, when Dr. Breslow began the Alameda study, half of Americans smoked regularly.
The survey also found a rise in the number of people who said they drank alcohol either moderately or not at all and a decline in the number who said they consumed more than three drinks on any given day.
In questioning Alameda County residents about how much they slept or whether they ate breakfast or ate between meals, Dr. Breslow said he did not mean to suggest that sleeping too much or too little, snacking and skipping breakfast were deadly habits in themselves on a par with smoking or excessive drinking. Rather, he said, "I believe these poor health practices are indicative of a chaotic life style" and that people who follow them are likely to pay inadequate attention to their overall well-being.
 
Unexpected Findings
 As the years passed, to the surprise of nearly all Dr. Breslow's colleagues, the study showed that snackers, breakfast skippers and people who slept more or less than seven to eight hours a night were more likely to die prematurely or to suffer life-limiting disabilities.
"Regularity in one's living habits seems to be important to health and longevity," Dr. Breslow said. He also urged health-care policy planners to recognize that "people do not choose their health habits in a vacuum; rather, they are strongly influenced by their social environment."
"We have to address the environmental and social influences on people's health practices, influences like cigarette advertising and the ease with which teenagers can buy cigarettes," he said.

Bonuses Planned For U.S. Medalists

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY

 BODY:
The United States Olympic Committee is planning to offer bonuses of $15,000, and possibly more, to most American athletes who win gold medals at the next winter and summer Olympic Games.
The plan was formulated by the Athletes Support Committee and is due to be approved at the U.S.O.C. board of directors meetings on June 5 and 6. According to the four-year, $7.6 million plan, silver medalists will receive $10,000, bronze medalists $7,500, and fourth-place finishers $5,000. 
 In addition, American athletes will receive up to $5,000 for winning major international competitions, such as world championships, in non-Olympic years.
"For some, this will strictly be a reward," said Carol Brown, chairman of the support committee. "For others, who have borrowed money for their training efforts, they will have a chance at reimbursement against the loans they have."
The new bonuses are based on projections that American athletes will win 19 medals (6 gold, 6 silver and 7 bronze) at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, and 184 medals (90 gold, 41 silver, and 53 bronze) at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
If, as the Olympics approach, it appears that these projections are too optimistic, the U.S.O.C. might increase the bonuses for each medal, Brown said.
The Athletes Support Committee has until the June meetings to come up with a special plan regarding athletes who earn large salaries within their own sport. The U.S.O.C. is wary of the perception that rich tennis or basketball players will receive bonus money, and the support committee has recommended that the bonuses for these players should go to the national governing body of the respective sports for youth development.
"National Basketball Association players have given more to our organization than we've ever given them," said Harvey Schiller, executive director of the U.S.O.C. Schiller, who calls the new bonuses "an extension" of the existing support system called Operation Gold, said that Magic Johnson recently donated a $10,000 international award that he received to youth development in basketball.
Several track-and-field stars have been calling for a similar, separate prize-money system for the world championships from the International Amateur Athletic Federation.
"Nobody's going to get rich here," Brown said. "But our athletes need more support than in the past. This system is easy to administer, it's objective, and it's incentive-based."

Where's the Pork?

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
To Bill Clinton
Re: The Economy
Well, Mr. President, it's time to go back to the future. 
 Good idea, reconnecting with just plain folks in Ohio and Illinois over the last few days. But you've got to go farther than that to get back to where you once belonged.
Go back to the days before Secret Service agents stuck to you like pilot fish to a shark, before you sat in the back seat of a car you didn't drive, before your life was filled with Rhodes scholars and movie stars.
Go back to the supermarket. Push a cart around and take a look at the difference between how those people you talked to in the Midwest are running their economies and the way they think you're running ours, a difference that has caused a rift between you and them.
Go back to February, when you managed with some eloquence to convince them that they had to join you in busting the deficit and that it would require pain all around.
They knew what that was like because they've done deficit-busting themselves. Times aren't what they were, and after putting the bread, the milk, the chicken and the toilet paper in the cart they know the sad truth: There is no more room, wallet-wise, for the Sara Lee cheesecake, the peaches and the dearer cuts of meat. The steaks, the veal and the pork.
You won so many of those people over with your economic speech. You persuaded them to be part of doing the right thing for the future.
But not the whole thing.
They've watched you go shopping for 100 days now and they haven't seen you make those hard choices. Instead they've figured out that taxes are going to pay for this deficit reduction. Instead you've used your political capital on a stimulus package, full of a nice this and a pleasant that, the equivalent of those coupons that save you a quarter on a new cereal you wouldn't normally buy.
There was a catch to your share-the-pain scenario, and now you're caught in it. You had to decide on broad and significant spending cuts. You had to ditch Federal departments and consolidate like crazy in grossly inflated bureaucracies.
You had to make another eloquent speech and show the public how you intended to spread the sacrifice around, to Democratic and Republican pet programs alike. When your people talked about $2 in cuts for every $1 in new taxes, it sounded fair. When the ratio became 1 to 1, you lost half your credibility.
You had to throw the pork out of the shopping cart. Some of that would surely make people mad. But at least when you went on trips like the one you took this week, you'd have something substantive to say. Grousing about Washington lobbyists gets old real fast. You don't want to start sounding like your predecessor on his peevish days.
People say the problem is that you've lost your focus, that you've got too many things on your mind. You don't get enough credit for having a mind big enough to have too many things on. After all, Ronald Reagan knew as much about public policy as he did about method acting. Other people focused for him.
You've done the right thing on social policy issues. You signed the family leave bill and overturned the gag rule and the ban on fetal tissue research. Your caution on gay men and lesbians in the military has had a bright side; it has fomented a national discussion on the issue of sexual orientation and shown many people how little they know.
Bosnia must be much on your mind. But you can't make the mistake that George Bush made during the gulf war, when the domestic agenda went to hell in the shadow of foreign affairs.
I don't know what happened to that sign in your campaign headquarters about the economy, stupid, but when you next speak to the American people it should be framed on your desk.
It's not easy when you compare your wallet with your wish list and don't bring home the bacon, but millions of Americans have learned how and you can, too. Think about what it's like when you get to the checkout and you don't have enough money to pay for what you've bought. You put back the things you don't absolutely positively need. Maybe that sounds simplistic. But it's how the people who employ you live day to day. And maybe simplistic, or at least simple, is what you're missing right now.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Station Rebirth Will Aid Region

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your May 2 article on Amtrak's proposal to move New York's Pennsylvania Station to the General Post Office building across the street fully investigates important esthetic issues. But it does not discuss other considerations, which should be seen as equally significant. 
The proposal offers a bold, creative solution to the problems that have beset the station and its users. It makes excellent use of a confluence of opportunities that are unlikely to appear again soon.
The Regional Plan Association has long advocated the development of a new station that could provide access to a comprehensive regional transportation network, and we are delighted by the proposal, which we see as a first step toward improving access to the heart of the region.
But plans should not stop here. There needs to be a second phase of development that would allow for the creation of additional train capacity to and through Pennsylvania Station to centers throughout the region. Under the Amtrak proposal, it would be difficult for New Jersey Transit or the Long Island Railroad to increase passenger service beyond their current levels.
Moreover, new and much needed services, such as a regional rail system connecting mass transit and commuter lines, could not be accommodated within this proposal.
Pennsylvania Station is one of the most important ports of entry in the region, serving many times the number of passengers as the airports serve. As such, it is the nexus of much of the region's physical and economic infrastructure.
The demolition of the original station signaled the start of 30 years of economic and civic decline. Its rebirth presents an opportunity for a turning point, a symbol of renewed confidence in the region's future.
We hope that the opportunity can be realized to the fullest extent possible.

HEADLINE: East Harlem Schools Have Success Story Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read "Our Students, Still at Risk" (Op-Ed, May 3), about New York City's Community School District 4 and its system of choice with dismay. 
 I am the principal of a "traditional" elementary school in East Harlem, Public School 171. Eighty percent of my students come from the neighborhood, which is beset with drugs, crime, unemployment, poverty and single parenthood. The student body, 536 students, is 98 percent minority; 67 percent receive free breakfast and lunch, which they eat in a 93-year-old school building.
Despite the odds against them, my students rank first in District 4 in standardized reading scores, with 53.9 percent reading at or above grade level. Almost 77 percent perform above grade level in math and also rank first in the district.
Public School 171 and its dedicated teachers are not rewarded for doing well. There are no dollars, it seems, for excellent schools, only for the unsuccessful. District public relations focus on "alternative" schools with "thematic" approaches.
I invite those interested in effective education to call me, see our school and see what else is going on in East Harlem.

HEADLINE: Right to Challenge Borrowing Is Upheld

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 11

 BODY:
The New York State Court of Appeals ruled today that citizens have the right to challenge state borrowing done without voter approval, reversing its earlier position and opening the door to a flurry of lawsuits.
The decision is a potential problem for the state, although the extent of the problem depends on further court decisions. The State Constitution says the state has to have the approval of voters for taxpayer-supported debt, though the reality is that most borrowing is conducted by public authorities outside voter scrutiny. Courts have upheld this in the past, but today's decision opened the way to a new wave of challenges. 
 While the court gave voters the standing to bring those challenges, it left unresolved how these would fare.
 
A 5-to-1 Decision
 In its 5-to-1 decision, the state's highest court refused to take up the issue of whether state practices, like allowing quasi-governmental authorities to borrow money to balance the state budget, are legal. That question should be put off until a later time, the court said, as it affirmed the public's right to scrutinize government action.
"Public indebtedness is viewed skeptically by the people of New York and must be tightly circumscribed by the people themselves and not entrusted finally even to their own representatives," said Judge Joseph W. Bellacosa, writing for the majority.
This was the second decision in two weeks calling into question longtime governmental practices. Last week the court ruled the Legislature could not call back bills from the Governor just to avoid a possible veto.
While state officials said they were relieved that their budget schemes had not been struck down, legislative aides and lawyers familiar with state borrowing practices said the judge almost seemed to be inviting new lawsuits. Previously, state courts had held citizens had no standing to sue.
"We're extremely concerned aobut this, particularly in light of our $6 billion transportation bonding deal in the past budget," one legislative aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It seems to us that the court is sending a pretty clear message."
Michael E. Katzenstein, a Manhattan lawyer specializing in public-authorities law, said the decision could open the door to scrutiny of borrowing practices he said had become "more and more abusive and less tasteful." He added: "You're going to have private litigants challenging state financing, which could be disruptive to the state. The court has said there has to be a way to review state actions where the executives and officers of the state would not be expected to seek review themselves."
The decision was a victory for Robert L. Schulz of Glens Falls, N.Y., who has devoted recent years to challenging the way the state spends its money. Mr. Schulz, a retired engineer who represents himself in court, has argued that as money grows tighter, the state's mechanisms for closing its budget gaps become shadier, falling increasingly beyond voter scrutiny.
"We are now free to take our case against runaway spending by self-serving and thoughtless governmental powers to the judiciary, where these cases rightfully belong," Mr. Schulz said in a statement.
Most of the state's borrowing is done by authorities that float bonds on their own and pay the debt service through legislative appropriations. The last two major bond issues put before the voters, an $800 million economic development proposal and a $1.9 billion environmental proposal, were defeated at the polls. In the last four years the state has borrowed $6.6 billion in nonvoter-approved debt. the state's total debt is expected to reach $27 billion within a year.
Mr. Schulz has brought a number of lawsuits against the state. In this case, he had challenged its 1990 scheme to allow the Urban Development Corporation to borrow $230 million to "buy" a state prison and a stretch of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, money which was then used to close the state budget gap.
 
Filed Too Late
 Judge Bellacosa ruled that Mr. Schulz had filed his lawsuit too late to generate a decision on the merits of the plan. But he said Mr. Schulz, and others like him, had every right to sue. "We cannot allow that right to become a dead letter, a mere set of hollow words," he said.
A second challenge by Mr. Schulz, which questioned the state's formation of a quasi-governmental borrowing authority called the Local Government Assistance Corporation, was not considered by the court on the ground that no constitutional issue was at stake.
While some expressed worry privately, state officials portrayed the decision as a win for their side, saying that it would have no immediate impact the state budget.
"This decision doesn't impugn the merits of the state's current borrowing practices," said John Clarkson, a spokesman for the State Budget Division. "The ruling may provide voters such as Mr. Schulz with a broader ability to sue, but we're not concerned about that because we're confident that our borrowing practices are constituitonal and we'll prevail in any court challenge."
But Marvin G. Nailor, a spokesman for H. Carl McCall, the new State Comptroller, said he was not so sure. "Any type of borrowing that bypasses the voters and has questionable payback arrangements certainly invites a lawsuit and the possiblity of success, particularly now that the plaintiff has standing to sue," he said.
The ruling was signed by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye and Judges Richard D. Simons, Vito J. Titone, and Stewart F. Hancock.
In a dissenting opinion, Judge George Bundy Smith said the court should have addressed whether the borrowing schemes were legal, rather than reserving such a decision until a later case.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a New York State Court of Appeals decision to let private citizens challenge the state's borrowing practices omitted the context for a comment by a lawyer, Michael E. Katzenstein. He referred specifically to a complicated state plan in 1990, under which a public authority borrowed money to buy a state prison, when he said, "Obviously, the plaintiffs' view in this case is that the one-shots, like the prison bond case, have become more and more abusive and less tasteful."

HEADLINE: Recession? Why Worry?

BYLINE: By John Kenneth Galbraith; John Kenneth Galbraith is professor emeritus of economics at Harvard.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Reputable economic attitudes hold that the economic norm is high, if not quite full, employment and a reliable rate of expansion in economic output. Recessions are an aberrant departure from that norm. Correction must come. The question after nearly three years is whether this is so. Or is it possible that the economy has settled into an underemployment equilibrium of small or negligible growth?
There is no great novelty in this suggestion. It happened in the Great Depression: there were 10 years of stagnation that ended not because of any internal dynamic but from the massive spending for the war. And one mildly esoteric branch of economic thought has long allowed for the possibility of an enduring underemployment equilibrium, of stability with high unemployment, of low or negligible economic growth. 
 One must, however, challenge all accepted attitudes on the next point. It is that recession is uniformly adverse in its effect and thus by everyone deplored. A great many people and an even higher proportion of those who have political voice and vote, though perhaps not a majority, find a recession quite comfortable, and certainly more so than the measures that do anything effective about it. This, however, no one dreams of saying.
Economists and all approved economic doctrine have made high employment and economic growth a sacred good. With this no one can openly disagree.
There are the many who live in recession with a wholly secure livelihood and with a lessened fear of price increases, of inflation. They are in no real danger of loss or diminution of income. Present here are the more secure parts of the modern corporate bureaucracy. Its members see their brethren being shed. (The corporate elite is never fired or sacked; in the interest of efficiency, in is only shed.) However, those who are truly influential have no fear. They, always in the interest of efficiency, are the ones who do the shedding.
Similarly secure are many in the professions, professors, needless to say, some public servants, lawyers, doctors and media stars. Also very important is the modern large rentier class. And many who live on Social Security or pensions.
For all these, recessions mean stable or even falling prices and no serious reduction of income. Relatively secure also are those Kansas farmers, constituents of Senator Bob Dole, whose prices are guaranteed by the Government, whose expenses and labor costs are now stable.
Also, in an economy where services are increasingly important, a recession means a more willing and pliant labor supply, an underclass more available for the unpleasant toil that makes life for the rest of us more agreeable. And for employers.
A recession in modern times is also for many far more attractive than remedial action against it.
The possible positive lines of action against recession are three: taxes can be reduced to enhance the flow of consumer and investment spending, or so it is hoped; interest rates can be lowered to enhance investment spending and consumer purchases of houses, automobiles, refrigerators and electronics, or so it is also hoped; the Government can undertake direct, forthright job creation. This is the holy trinity. Prayer and repetitive prediction of recovery apart, there are no other lines of action.
Tax reduction has its proponents, notably among those who pay the taxes. Unfortunately, its relation to recovery is theoretical. There is the difficult question as to whether the revenues released will be spent or invested; they may be held as cash or unused bank balances. And tax reduction would increase the deficit, concern with which has now reached near paranoiac proportions. Again, better the recession.
Next, there is monetary policy: the reduction of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. This is believed to have a peculiar magic. It calls for no big bureaucratic effort, carries no threat of taxes -- and a special intelligence is taken to characterize those who are associated occupationally with money.
But monetary policy works against recession by reducing interest rates and therewith rentier income. This is by no means welcomed by those who enjoy such income. They are not without political influence. Any talk of an easier monetary policy automatically brings grave and urgent warnings of the danger of inflation. This, too, is a threat to those on stable incomes.
Additionally, there is the sad fact that in a recession monetary policy doesn't work. The elasticity of the response to reduced interest rates is then very low. People and firms spend and invest, or fail to do so, pretty much as before.
Finally, there is direct Government expenditure and employment. For those resting comfortably in recession, this is the worst of all. It could raise prices, risk inflation. Much worse, it promises higher taxes at some time yet to come.
President Clinton proposed a very modest economic expansion program; we have seen what happened. As the recession continues, I hope he will come back to this policy with force. That is not, however, my point here. I have a lesser plea; it concerns our awkward secret, our forbidden truth.
We pride ourselves in being plain-spoken, free from cant and certainly from any pathological self-delusion. Given a fact, we face it. Let us now face the fact that for many a recession is a tolerable, even pleasant thing. And let us say so. This will not be popular. There could be indignant denial. That is often the response to unwelcome truth.

HEADLINE: A PRICE RISE FANS INFLATION CONCERN

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
An unexpected surge in wholesale prices last month, the latest of a string of higher price reports, left many economists and investors wondering whether the inflation genie was starting to slip out of the bottle.
Producer prices leaped six-tenths of a percent in April, the Labor Department reported yesterday. That jump -- the biggest in two and a half years and significantly larger than most forecasters expected -- unsettled everyone from bond investors to homeowners who had not gotten around to refinancing their mortgages and worried that an uptick in inflation could push interest rates higher.
 
4.7% Annual Rate
 Although bad weather was partly to blame and the monthly rate probably exaggerates the average increases over a longer stretch of time, the spurt suggested that the sanguine inflation forecasts of the Federal Reserve and the Clinton Administration, of 2.5 to 3 percent for the year, could ultimately prove a shade too rosy. 
 The Producer Price Index has now risen at an annual rate of 4.7 percent so far this year, well above the 1.6 percent increase for 1992. The index measures price changes of all goods produced in the United States -- everything from computers to celery -- and is based on a monthly survey mailed to 87,000 factories and farms. Since it covers only about 30 percent of economic activity, a rise in the index does not translate into an equal increase in inflation generally.
To some economists, the most eye-catching number in the report was the underlying or "core" inflation rate -- the index stripped of volatile food and energy prices. This core number has risen at a 3.4 percent annual rate so far this year, noticeably faster than last year's 2 percent, though merely a fraction of the 12.8 percent increase in 1979, during the high inflation years.
Administration economists called the numbers disappointing, but, like many analysts, said they were waiting to see today's Consumer Price Index, a broader measure that includes services as well as goods. Most economic forecasters have predicted a moderate rise of two-tenths or three-tenths of a percent -- in line with what they had expected for producer prices. Although consumer prices generally move roughly in parallel with producer prices, they do not necessarily match each other month by month.
 
High Vegetable Prices
 Several special one-time events, including bad weather that pushed up vegetable prices, made things look worse than they probably were.. But the fact that analysts were unpleasantly surprised for several months in a row made many reluctant to dismiss the report as yet another fluke.
"You can keep saying this is an exception and that's an exception but pretty soon things add up to a trend," said Tom Tibbetts, who is in charge of the producer price survey at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "The accumulation of special factors makes it look like inflation is a little warmer this year than last year."
Even if the poorer performance continues, however, a modest increase in the inflation rate is not expected to alter the political battle that is shaping up over Alan Greenspan's steady-as-she-goes monetary policy.
Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, said that he and fellow Democrats planned to keep pressing the Federal Reserve to push interest rates lower -- even if inflation does worsen a bit.
"We have already pushed the Fed, and continue to keep up the pressure," he said. "The first thing the Fed should not do is panic and use these numbers to tighten.
"At best, they ought to consider loosening to spur more economic growth. They ought to put up a sign over the Fed saying 'It's not inflation, stupid.' "
But Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, said the Fed should not back off. "They need to be vigilant," he said. "My Democratic colleagues want to use fiscal policy to aggravate the economic situation. Then they want to say to the Fed essentially, 'You guys have to pull our car out of ditch.' There's no way that monetary policy can undo the harmful effects of bad fiscal policy."
Investors initially reacted to the report yesterday morning by selling bonds and stocks and driving up gold prices, partly because the report dashed hopes of easing by the Fed to bolster the weak economy.
"Inflation is starting to come back a little," said Brian Keyser, an economist at CRT Government Securities. "If the Fed doesn't step on it later this year, we could have a real problem in 1994."
Bad weather can be blamed for more than a third of the leap in the producer price index last month. Thanks to wet weather in the West and cold in Florida, fruit and vegetable prices zoomed at one of the fastest rates on record, by 44.7 percent, as heavy rains washed away crops in the fields. Those price are likely to fall again within a couple of months.
 
No 'Catastrophe' Seen
 "This isn't a catastrophe," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting at Georgia State University, and one of the few forecasters who saw the spurt in producer prices coming. "We get six different crops a year and within two months we'll get the East Coast crop."
Another jolt came from tobacco prices, which rose about 8 percent in the last year. But smokers of Marlboros or Camels or other popular brands are expecting price cuts. Philip Morris, for example, announced on April 2 that it was cutting the price of Marlboros by 40 cents a pack, but the average price of wholesale cigarettes did not start to fall until May and is apt to keep declining in June. R. J. Reynolds is also making cuts.
A factor likely to weigh against inflation is lingering unemployment, which holds down wage gains. Unit labor costs have been rising very slowly, thanks to rapid productivity gains. And factories still have lots of spare capacity.
But there were also signs in yesterday's report that businesses, which have not been very successful at raising prices in the weak economy of the last few years, are trying again to increase profit margins, especially since virtually all of the improvements in profitability so far have come from cost cutting.

HEADLINE: Clinton Supports Creating Fund Designated Solely to Cut Deficit

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Responding to accusations by Ross Perot and Republicans that he is just another tax-and-spend Democrat, President Clinton yesterday endorsed a proposal to require that all the money raised by tax increases in his new budget be used solely to reduce the Federal deficit.
Locking new tax revenues and savings from some of his proposed budget cuts into what he termed a "trust fund" would guarantee that the sacrifices the budget demands of the voters would go toward their stated purpose, Mr. Clinton said. 
 The new taxes that would be required to pay for Mr. Clinton's health-care and welfare proposals, expected in the coming few months but not included in this budget, would not be covered by the deficit-reduction measure he talked about yesterday.
The President's position would not change the substance of his budget, now being considered by Congress. Aides to Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the fund idea is primarily a political gesture to underscore their commitment to attack the deficit. Details on how the fund might work have yet to be worked out.
"Credibility is difficult to come by in Washington today," Mr. Clinton said in a speech to community and business leaders at Cooper Union in Manhattan. "After 12 years of rising deficits and Americans' feeling deceived about the issue, I don't blame the people of this country for being distrustful about what they hear from Washington when it comes to bringing down this deficit."
With a "deficit-reduction trust fund," added Mr. Clinton, "the American people know that it has to go to deficit reduction."
Mr. Clinton was welcomed at Cooper Union by a host of New York Democrats, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
 
Cutbacks in Military
 Mr. Clinton said the new spending programs in his budget would be offset by cuts in discretionary spending, particularly military programs.
On Capitol Hill, the trust fund idea was denounced as a gimmick by Republicans and cautiously supported by Democrats. Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, the head of the Budget Committee, called it a "laudable goal" that was already covered by budget law.
Administration officials said the proposed legal handcuffs on spending would apply to the taxes and cutbacks in the budget that takes effect Oct. 1. That budget, for fiscal 1994, is part of a five-year program of tax increases and spending cuts designed by the Clinton Administration to trim the deficit, now roughly $320 billion a year, in half.
If the economy went into deep recession and the Administration wanted to engage in deficit spending to spur growth, it could pass a special supplemental bill to do that at any time.
 
No 'Gimmick,' Schumer Says
 "This does not change the current budget numbers," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who has been leading the drive for this deficit-reducing trust fund in Congress. "But it is not a gimmick either. There is a problem of credibility. The public does not believe we will really cut the deficit when we say we will, and this puts our feet to the fire."
"Everywhere I went in my district people said, 'We are willing to tighten our belt, but we don't believe you,' " Mr. Schumer went on. "The popular view was that we would raise the taxes and then spend it on pork. And this will not allow that to happen."
A total of $496 billion in extra taxes, cuts in spending and savings from lower interest payments are expected to be realized over the next five years, Administration officials said. They broke that down as $101.9 billion in savings from cuts in military and civilian spending (the amount left over after Mr. Clinton pays for his $135 billion in new programs over the next five years); $50.3 billion in reduced interest payments on the debt; $103.2 billion from cuts in entitlement programs, and $240.7 billion in additional tax revenues.
Congress would have to approve the trust fund proposal as an amendment to the fiscal 1994 budget bill now under consideration.
White House officials had been talking with Mr. Schumer about this idea for the past few weeks. They suddenly called him at 10 A.M. yesterday to say that they were going to get behind his idea and that he should get on a plane to New York to be on hand when Mr. Clinton discussed it at the Cooper Union yesterday afternoon.
Administration officials said they decided to appropriate the idea to blunt efforts by Mr. Perot and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, to undercut the President's $1.5 trillion budget, the same way they did his economic-stimulus package, by presenting it as just more deficit spending.
A prime reason the stimulus package failed was because it called for more deficit spending without offsetting budget cuts -- a move opposed not only by Mr. Perot and the Republicans, but by many conservative Democrats.
Clinton Administration officials acknowledged that they had misgauged the public's desire for real deficit reduction, before any new spending. For the past few weeks, conservative Democrats have been bombarding the White House with reports from the home front that voters are ready to sacrifice and tighten their belts.
"This is our way of telling people, 'You don't have to worry, all your sacrifices will go into deficit reduction,' " said Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to the President.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, the Republicans' designated spokesman on budget issues, called the proposal "a transparent attempt to mislead the American people."
"This President has a long-established pattern of behavior in his four months in office: when something goes south, he changes the subject," Mr. Gramm said. The trust fund, he argued, was an attempt to divert public attention from the size and scope of his tax plans.
Senator Sasser said the budget law already contained guarantees that tax increases be used only for deficit reduction, and that any spending increases be offset by spending cuts.
 
An Economist's Opinion
 But an economist who is a former Congressional budget expert gave the idea some support. "I wouldn't go so far as to use the term gimmick," said this budget expert. "It is a kind of political device, and it might be a useful political device, to increase the discipline in budgeting. It is unlikely to do much harm, and might do some good."
During the campaign, President George Bush suggested that taxpayers be allowed to dedicate a portion of the tax payments to reducing the deficit, an idea criticized at the time by the Democrats.
The latest idea for a defict-paying trust fund was hatched in conversations in the House between Mr. Schumer and fellow Democrats, Bill Brewster of Oklahoma, Chet Edwards of Texas, Jane Harman of California and Robert Wise of West Virginia. It has also been under discussion in the Senate by Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey.
Mr. Schumer said he and his colleagues concluded that if they could find a way to guarantee that all tax increases go to reduce the deficit it would resonate with the public and make passage of the Clinton budget that much easier.
Mr. Clinton has used the trust fund approach before, during his last term as Governor of Arkansas. As he was trying to convince a reluctant public to accept tax increases so he could raise money for schools, Mr. Clinton promised that every dollar raised would be placed in a special account, and no money would be taken from that account unless it went to the schools.
The idea had been used before in Arkansas, early in this century. But it fell out of favor when certain government agencies began enriching themselves with special-purpose taxes. When the Clinton Administration revived the idea in Arkansas in 1991, it proved quite popular, and the new taxes were approved.

HEADLINE: Report Calls Simple Test Effective In Reducing Colon Cancer Deaths

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
After decades of debate and inconclusive findings, a major new study has shown that a yearly test can significantly reduce deaths from colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Americans.
In the 13-year study, those in a group randomly chosen to undergo annual tests for blood in their stools experienced 33 percent fewer deaths from cancers of the colon and rectum than did those in a similar group who were not offered the test. 
 The study, using 46,551 Minnesota residents, showed that the screening test could detect many colorectal cancers at an early stage, when they are curable. At this stage, symptoms of cancer typically have not yet appeared.
The test also turned up many adenomatous polyps, lesions in the bowel that are considered precancerous.
 
'Astounding Result'
 The life-saving benefit was found even though only 46 percent of the screened group took all 11 of the offered tests.
One drawback to the findings, however, is that because fecal blood can be caused by benign conditions, people with positive results on the screening test have to undergo costly follow-up exams to determine whether they actually have cancer.
The study, longer and larger than any before it, is being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.
"We think this is quite an astounding result in terms of its impact on this disease," the director of the study, Dr. Jack S. Mandel, said yesterday in an interview.
The findings suggest that if all Americans over age 50 took the test every year, more than a quarter of a million lives would be saved over the next 13 years, based on current incidence and death rates from colorectal cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 152,000 new cases of this cancer will be diagnosed this year, and 57,000 Americans, a vast majority of them over 50, will die of the disease, which ranks behind lung cancer as a cause of death among Americans.
Dr. Sidney J. Winawer, chief of the gastroenterology and nutrition service at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said in an interview that according to the findings, 1 in 10 people who are not considered at high risk for colon cancer will have a positive stool test, "and in this group you'll find 92 percent of the colon cancers."
Dr. Winawer, who wrote an editorial praising the new study, said it showed "for the first time a significant decline in the death rate as a result of testing for fecal occult blood."
The cancer society currently recommends that people over age 50 should get the test, which costs only $20 to $40, once a year.
But the encouraging results, while vindicating the cancer society's assertion that the simple test for fecal occult, or hidden, blood can save lives, is likely to prompt further debate over the question, Can a health-care system in economic straits afford the millions of expensive follow-up tests that would be needed to determine which of the nearly 10 percent of people with positive results on the screening test actually have cancer or premalignant polyps?
In the new study, by Dr. Mandel and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, only one in three people whose screening tests showed blood in the stool were subsequently found to have cancer or precancerous polyps. But all those with positive test results had to undergo a costly colonoscopy, a procedure in which a flexible scope is used to examine the entire five feet of the lower bowel.
When performed in a doctor's office, a colonoscopy typically costs $700 to $900. But hospitals, where some colonoscopies are performed, may charge two to three times those prices.
If all 60 million Americans over 50 had a fecal occult blood test each year, the new study suggests that about six million of them would need the costly follow-up tests.
"There is a real problem with translating these results into public policy," said Dr. Douglas B. McGill, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., whose study published two months ago declared the stool test to be ineffective as a screening tool. "Given the considerable costs of follow-up exams, it has to be determined whether screening for occult blood is worth it."
Dr. McGill noted that only 2.2 percent of those with positive results on the stool tests were ultimately found to have cancer, which means that 97.8 percent were subjected to the costly follow-up exams only to be found free of actual disease.
Over the 13 years of the study, 38 percent of the participants had positive results on one or more stool tests and had to undergo one or more colonoscopies. Dr. McGill predicted that just doing that many colonoscopies on a random group of people, without testing first for occult blood, would result in a decline in cancer deaths similar to what Dr. Mandel and his colleagues found.
One advantage to colonoscopy is that possible cancerous lesions can be biopsied, and premalignant polyps can be removed during the same procedure. In the new study, nearly 30 percent of those with blood in their stool were subsequently found to have polyps that could become cancerous years later. By removing those polyps, future cancers can be prevented.
The screening test for fecal occult blood, developed in the late 1960's, is familiar to many Americans who have routine health checkups. It involves test cards impregnated with a substance called guaiac. The cards are smeared with tiny stool samples from three consecutive bowel movements, then mailed to a physician or laboratory for analysis. If blood is present in any of the samples, the test is considered positive.
However, many factors, including various foods, like meat, aspirin-like drugs and vitamin C, and the presence of bleeding hemorrhoids, can produce false positive results on the stool test.
In the new study, a drop of water was added to the smears that had dried in transit, which quadrupled the ability of the test to detect hidden blood. This increased sensitivity may partly explain the encouraging results from the Minnesota study when previous studies, including those done at the Mayo Clinic on dry stool samples, failed to show a life-saving benefit from the screening test.

HEADLINE: Coverage Cited by Groups Opposing Sale of Post to Murdoch

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Civil rights groups and minority businessmen seeking to block Rupert Murdoch's proposed purchase of The New York Post have argued in filings with the Federal Government that the move would perpetuate poor coverage of the city's black and Hispanic communities.
They told the Federal Communication Commissions that allowing Mr. Murdoch to own both a local television station and The Post would stifle competition. They also accused Mr. Murdoch and all of the city's daily newspapers of discrimination in both hiring and promotion practices and coverage of minority issues. Mr. Murdoch owns WNYW-TV, Channel 5, which is part of the Fox network. 
 William Reyner Jr., Mr. Murdoch's lawyer, said, "We're not really surprised by the filings. They're making the kind of arguments you would expect in this proceeding."
At least one civil rights group, the Congress of Racial Equality, supports Mr. Murdoch's request for a waiver from a Federal rule that prohibits anyone from owning both a television or radio station and a daily newspaper in the same city. The rule, which forced him to sell The Post when he bought WNYW-TV, has never been waived, although many newspaper companies own radio or television stations in the same city because the stations were started or purchased before it went into effect.
Other supporters warned that without the waiver, The Post would die because Mr. Murdoch would be unable to buy the paper and there were no other credible bidders.
In a filing with the F.C.C., the Metropolitan Council of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Branches said that "diversification at the highest levels of media influence -- involving a television network, TV Guide, a VHF-TV station and a daily newspaper in the nation's largest city -- could not be more relevant to the competitive environment in the New York media."
"Regrettably, the New York media, including The Post and WNYW-TV, have not served the largest black community outside the continent of Africa," said papers filed by Laura D. Blackburne, general counsel of the New York State Conference of Branches of the N.A.A.C.P. She also represented The Amsterdam News and its publisher, Wilbert A. Tatum.
Similarly, the Caucus for Media Diversity, an ad hoc group that represents the National Hispanic Media Coalition, among other groups, said that "New York City's four white corporate-owned newspapers presently provide little diversity of news and editorial coverage from the perspective of minority groups and others that constitute the bulk of the city's population."
Mr. Murdoch's petition also was opposed by the National Black Media Coalition and the Committee to Eliminate Media Offensive to the African People, which charged that "Murdoch's station and The New York Post appear to discriminate against African American employees." The newspaper and the station "do not employ African Americans in managerial or executive positions and actively attack and denigrate leaders and members of the African American community."
 
A Supporter
 But the chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, Roy Innis, wrote, "Should The Post go out of business, an often eloquent voice of dissent compared to the majority of the media will be lost."
One law firm that opposed Mr. Murdoch did not disclose its client, either in its filings or in responding to a telephone request for the information. Fleischman & Walsh, a Washington firm that specializes in cable-television law, said that if Mr. Murdoch received a waiver, "The result would not be an increase in media diversity, but would actually be a decrease in both the diversity of media voices and in economic competition among the mass media."
The F.C.C. filing showed that Mr. Murdoch had a number of supporters, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Mr. Murdoch also won the support of the Democratic and Republican leaders of New York's City Council, Peter F. Vallone, Speaker and Majority Leader, and Alfred C. Cerrulo 3d.

HEADLINE: For Clinton, Barricades But Few Hands to Shake

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS

 BODY:
Maybe it was the police presence that made Cooper Square look like an occupied country. Maybe it was the prospect of waiting in the hot sun for three hours. Or maybe, it was simply that spectacle-weary New Yorkers would just as soon have watched the whole thing on television.
Whatever the reason, the crowd greeting President Clinton when he stepped out of Cooper Union after delivering his economics address yesterday afternoon was surprisingly small by Presidential -- or New York -- standards. At many places along the metal barricades, in fact, onlookers stood less than one deep as they waited for the chance to shake hands with Mr. Clinton. 
 "Why isn't there more of a crowd?" asked Ellie McCully, as she stood with her son, Cameron, and a group of other parents who had brought their children to the event after a class at a nearby gymnasium. "When the Pope came to town, every street was packed with people -- and there was torrential rain."
Security for the event, the President's first stop on his first visit to New York since his inauguration, was intense. Three hours before Mr. Clinton's arrival, a police bomb squad was called to inspect a black metal box that had been found hanging from a fence outside the building, a police spokesman, Officer Scott Bloch, said. The box was found to contain some bricks, he said.
 
'Too Cool' for This?
 Rows and rows of police barricades lined the streets around Cooper Union, from Astor Place to Second Avenue. Police sharpshooters patrolled the rooftops, Secret Service agents strolled with their fingers on their earphones and police officers on foot patrol were everywhere.
The only thing missing was the civilians.
"Maybe people on the Lower East Side are too cool for this," said Carl Hultberg, recycling coordinator for New York University, as he leaned on a barricade on Cooper Square, waiting for a glimpse of the President.
Aside from the speech, the President's day, in many ways, had a not-for-the-masses quality. His only other scheduled event, a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser at Lincoln Center, where tickets went for up to $2,500 each, was closed to the media and public.
Under a white tent in Damrosch Park, "everybody who's anybody" mingled, including various local union presidents, county Democratic leaders and Mayor David N. Dinkins, who strolled around the crowd, said Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, a big Clinton supporter who stayed just long enough to be kissed by the President.
During the event, the table talk was so distracting that at one point, the Mayor gave up trying to address the audience, said Gordon Davis, a former city parks commissioner, who was among the guests. The Mayor, in turn, was admonished by the actress Whoopi Goldberg for speaking on his cellular phone while she was addressing the crowd, Mr. Davis said.
Because Mr. Clinton's main appearance was in the East Village, away from midtown traffic, disruptions were minimal for much of the day, although the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive was closed from South Street to the Triborough Bridge from about 4:30 to 5 P.M., officials said.
"It may be coincidental that the President chose a location in the East Village rather than in midtown," said Samuel I. Schwartz, a former deputy commissioner of transportation who helped arrange several Presidential visits during the 1980's. "But that means less of a dramatic effect on traffic at the busiest places."
There was congestion of another sort -- call it politicianlock -- inside the Great Hall at Cooper Union, a college of art and architecture, where Mr. Clinton delivered his speech to an audience of about 900, including a bevy of admiring New York Democrats. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Dinkins and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan paid tribute to the President in their introductions, and the President returned the favor in his remarks, which were broadcast by loudspeaker into Cooper Square.
The speech, in which he endorsed a proposal to require that the money raised by tax increases in his new budget and saved by spending cuts be used to reduce the Federal deficit, drew raves from many politicians.
"He was superb," said Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Congresswoman and Democratic Vice Presidential candidate. "He was energetic. He was funny. It was just very impressive: really talking about the responsibility of Government."
 
Hand-Shaking and Sweating
 But on the street outside the Great Hall, most of those who had waited for the better part of the afternoon to see the President were not as impressed with his words as with his presence. For the opportunity to shake Mr. Clinton's hand, they had to walk through metal detectors and wait in a fenced-off area.
About 4:30 P.M. the President emerged beaming from the Cooper Union building. He was jacketless, his blue shirt drenched in perspiration, as he plunged into the crowd with Mayor Dinkins in tow. For the next 15 minutes, he shook virtually every hand in the crowd, which, despite its size, seemed to represent a snapshot of the face of New York City in mid-spring: nannies with babies, college students, Japanese tourists.
"Nice eyes," said Karah Woodward, after shaking Mr. Clinton's hand. "Beautiful blue eyes."
Her friend, Amy Kates, who works with her at a management-consulting firm on East Ninth Street, added, "The air-conditioning must not be working in there."
Many in the crowd hypothesized that Mr. Clinton's choice of the East Village was a sign that he was more attuned to the concerns of average people than his predecessors.
"This is one of the hippest places in New York," said Larry Florman, a clerk at the Carl Fischer music store across the street from the Cooper Union. "If anybody says a President is coming downtown, it's usually Wall Street."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Producer Price Rise Jars Treasury Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
There was a rude awakening for the Treasury market yesterday: The April jump in producer price inflation was much higher than expected and signaled that there is less hope now for a new rally based on declining inflation.
The metaphorical slap in the face pushed prices lower, with the 30-year bond down 19/32 point and the yield up to 6.85 percent, from 6.81 percent Tuesday. The prices of two-year to five-year notes fell much less, however, because inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments, has less impact on shorter-term securities. 
 The selling, which came in the morning, might have actually helped the Treasury's auction of $10.76 billion of 10-year notes because the price of that issue also fell ahead of the 1 P.M. bidding deadline, making it more attractive to dealers.
In the end, the 10-year auction went fairly well, with an average yield of 5.96 percent, the lowest since the Treasury began regular auctions in 1978. But that was not enough to lift the cloud created by the inflation report or to offset concerns about today's $8.25 billion auction of 30-year bonds. That auction could be undermined by the hangover of yesterday's inflation report and the release of the Consumer Price Index today. The April report on retail sales could also give traders headaches on the final day of the Treasury's quarterly auction series.
The bad news for traders and investors was in the six-tenths of one percentage point increase in the Producer Price Index for finished goods. Some analysts dismissed the April increase as an aberration, in part because of the weather-induced 44.7 percent increase in the prices of fresh and dried vegetables.
Some traders said if the figures had been taken as a new sign of rising inflation and not just an aberration, the selloff would have been steeper.
But this is the third out of the first four months of the year that the index has been higher than expectations because of aberrations and "these aberrations are adding up to a higher P.P.I. number," Michael H. Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International, said. "Bond investors should take a look at it."
If future reports make it clearer that inflation will be higher this year, there will be more upward pressure on interest rates. The C.P.I. rose 3 percent last year. But those who think it will be higher this year say the increase will be small.
Traders were able to dismiss the jump in food prices. But they had trouble with the more than 1 percent increase, after seasonal adjustment, in the price of passenger cars. "The car prices are real to me," one trader said.
"When the market was rallying earlier this year, people expected that the rate of inflation would be lower," Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said. "I think the market has realized that inflation won't be lower, but I do not think that it has realized that it will be higher."
However, some traders and forecasters, including those at Merrill Lynch, still expect inflation to decline, despite yesterday's report.
 
 
Four Themes
 Inflation is one of the four themes that have been influencing trading recently. And because traders can quickly turn from positive to negative, the bond market has been locked in a narrow trading range for two months.
The others are the pace of economic growth, President Clinton's handling of the economy and the deficit, and technical factors, which include the strong demand for Treasury securities because portfolio managers still have a lot of cash to invest.
The inflation theme had been a worry but was put to rest temporarily by the small increases in the producer and consumer price indexes in March. That confidence was unsettled a bit yesterday.
On growth, the data have been relatively positive for the market as it shows that the economy continues to appear to be moving ahead at a slow pace that would not put any upward pressure on prices. But this could change later in the year.
 
 
Deficit Doubts
 The recent setbacks to President Clinton on his economic program have raised some doubts about the outlook for significant deficit reduction, although it was his promise of such reduction that fueled the rally earlier this year.
The fate of today's 30-year bond auction is likely to hinge on the C.P.I. report and retail sales reports for April. A jump of two-tenths of one percentage point in the C.P.I. and a 1.2 percent rise in retail sales, which are the consensus forecasts, would settle inflationary jitters and help the auction. Stronger inflation and stronger sales would cause trouble.
The success of yesterday's 10-year note auction was reflected in trading afterward, when the yield in the when-issued market fell to 5.92 percent, from the 5.96 average at the auction.
The 10-year notes are the same as the 6.25 percent issue that was originally sold in February and matures in February 2003. The Treasury reopened the issue because there was a severe shortage of the notes available for trading, which left open the possibility that the issue could be manipulated.
The reopening policy was set after the Treasury bidding scandal at Salomon Brothers in 1991. The 30-year bond sale will also be a reopening of the 7.125 percent issue sold in February and maturing in 2023.
Following are the results of the 10-year note auction yesterday:

HEADLINE: Ethiopians Return, Glad to Help Build a New Land

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia

 BODY:
After two decades of Marxist rule and civil war that have left the economy in ruins, a handful of Ethiopians have returned here from exile to help build a new government in a nation that has never had a democratic tradition.
It is proving to be an enormous, painful task. With eight months left before the transitional Government must step down after national elections, it is still unclear whether Ethiopia -- which has finally achieved peace and with it some stability -- can avoid falling back into ethnically fueled civil war. 
 Nebiyu Samuel, who was a broker in Los Angeles, came to visit in 1991 after 19 years in exile. When he was invited by the leading guerrilla group to take part in a national conference to establish a transitional government, he decided to stay permanently. He gave up his job and left his family behind.
A year and a half later, as the head of a political party, he earns the equivalent of $150 a month. He says he leaves his office many days overcome by frustration and futility and deeply lonely for his wife and child. Yet he has no intention of giving up. As a former businessman, he says, he knows the necessity of planning for the future.
Andreas Eshete is in his mid-40's like Mr. Samuel. His world is one of ideas. A political philosopher who has taught at Brown University and the University of California at Berkeley, he too has returned permanently after 20 years in exile -- but not as part of the Government.
He works for Inter-Africa Group, a private organization that wants to act as an impartial contributor to building government here. His aim is to restore intellectual and political life and, most important, the freedom of debate.
Mr. Eshete is helping organize a symposium on building a constitution, analyzing the problems Ethiopia's transitional Government is having and studying the new constitutions of Eastern Europe to glean the good and discard the bad from what those governments have learned.
 
The Idealist
 Another Ethiopian who has returned is Netsannet Asfaw. Seventeen years ago she left her infant daughter in her mother's care in Addis Ababa and joined the Tigrean People's Liberation Front to fight a war against the Government in northern Ethiopia. She did not see her daughter for 10 years, traveling from the bush, where she fought with weapons to overthrow the Government, to England and the United States, where she fought with words.
Ms. Asfaw also returned to Addis Ababa in 1991, after the fall of the Marxist Government, and joined the governing party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Defense Front, as press secretary to President Meles Zenawi. Her intensity and air of simplicity mirror the almost puritanical zeal of the front, a grass-roots movement that she says is intent on uprooting poverty and bringing Ethiopia into the 21st century.
Some Western analysts have said democracy in Ethiopia is an experiment likely to fail. But these three returnees have a stubborn faith that Ethiopia will survive. Mixing Western theories with Ethiopian traditions, they have brought with them varied experiences and new thoughts and energy to find ways to bridge the gap between the skeleton of a Marxist state and a new government, as yet undefined.
"I'm trying to be a realist," said Mr. Samuel, whose party, the Ethiopian Democratic Coalition, advocates multiparty democracy, a free-market economy and a limited role for government. "Sometimes I find myself in a dilemma. Is the ideal of democracy too Westernized? Is it too unnatural for Africa?
"But the bottom line is that the commitment to democracy is the only alternative. But democracy is a process, not a one-shot deal. I am here because it is the most crucial period in my country's history. There is a lot of work to be done and a lot of ugly things to confront."
Many Ethiopians say that compared with the situation two years ago, any change will be progress. A pawn of the cold war, Ethiopia was one of the United States' main African allies in the 1950's and 1960's under Emperor Haile Selassie. It entered the Soviet camp in 1977 under the Marxist rule of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam and remained there until the revolutions in Eastern Europe brought about the collapse of Ethiopia's overseas alliances.
It remains a deeply traumatized country. For two decades, civil war against the Mengistu Government killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people. A decade ago famine killed one million more. When in May 1991 the guerrillas led by the People's Front overthrew Colonel Mengistu and established a transitional Government, the country was in economic and political disarray, an entire generation lost to war.
Since then, the front-led Government of President Meles, who was chosen head of state in July 1991 at a conference of Ethiopian parties and whose term runs until national elections are held next January, has been promised $650 million in aid through next year by Western donors. And it has embarked on an ambitious program to rebuild its destroyed infrastructure.
The currency is being devalued and the bureaucracy slimmed down, half a million soldiers have been demobilized and farm prices have been freed. The rains have been the best in years and harvests have been good.
In an effort to create a federal system and to placate minorities, the Government has advocated self-determination for the country's ethnic groups and is pushing for the regionalization of power away from the capital.
 
Poverty, and Hope
 Addis Ababa, like the rest of Ethiopia, emanates an air of uncertainty, of a land torn between poverty and a tentative future. Even the symbols of the past Government have been left behind in limbo. Most of the hammers and sickles have been pulled down, but the red stars and the huge revolutionary arches and squares remain.
Shantytowns are huddled near the wide avenues, with their 1970's Soviet-style crumbling concrete high rises, and beggars comb the streets. Yet business is slowly coming to life in Addis Ababa, even though foreign investors are still only tentatively exploring the market. The Italian clothing chain Benetton has opened a store, and chic restaurants and discos are thriving.
But the plight of the Ethiopian economy may be the greatest threat to a sustainable democratic transition. The problems remain staggering. Unemployment is more than 40 percent, wages are miserably low, and ethnically and politically the country of about 53 million is deeply divided.
Most of the members of the People's Front are Tigreans from the north, and the main opposition groups are formed by the Oromos, based in the east, and the Amharas, who are spread throoughout the country. The enmity was underscored last fall when the Oromo Liberation Front, the largest opposition group, pulled out of the Government and accused the People's Front of rigging the regional elections last June. Since then it has threatened secession.
In the midst of this uncertainty, the Government is trying to create a constitution. It has formed a constitutional committee with an 11-member executive committee that meets twice weekly. Formally, the constitution will have to be revised by a constituent assembly elected in the coming national vote.
The constitution is seen as the tool that will legitimize any future government, the first step in building domestic and international confidence and the only alternative to reverting to civil war for solving problems. It must address problems as diverse as the limits of power (at present a de facto one-party rule), language differences and the relationship between church and state. The traditionally powerful Coptic Christian Church was muzzled by the former Government.
Some of the biggest challenges facing Ethiopia have been pushed into the constitutional realm. The most heated and critical issue is property rights, Mr. Eshete said. In a country that is more than 85 percent agricultural, where land has been owned by the Government for decades, the Government has said the constitution will describe how private ownership will be achieved.
"It is going to be a very painful transition," Mr. Eshete said. "This must be an exercise on the debate over the future visions of Ethiopia. It is the first time here that constitution-making may be a meaningful effort. Confidence has to be built, and citizens have to be convinced to become involved."
Through his party, Mr. Samuel hopes at least to introduce new ideas, in particular a push for a multiparty system.
"Ethiopia is in a very precarious situation," he said. "People argue that what they want is bread and butter, not promises of democracy. They say, rather than giving us democracy, give us discipline."
Ms. Asfaw said: "We have achieved peace, but the greatest challenge is development. Even if you have five years, it won't be perfect. If we fail, we start again."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
U.N. Steps Said to Dry Up Serbs' Cash

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
A looming cash shortage brought on by the latest United Nations sanctions is a major element in the sudden push by Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, for peace in Bosnia, Administration officials say.
The new sanctions, which took effect on April 26, have seriously disrupted the intricate network of banks and front companies Serbia relies on to evade the year-old Western embargo, the officials said. 
 Administration officials said that one of the most significant setbacks for the Serbs unfolded last month in Cyprus, when banking authorities responding to the new sanctions seized as much as $500 million in Yugoslav assets.
 
Pledge to Cut Supplies
 Just days later, Mr. Milosevic publicly appealed to the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace plan that they had twice rejected. American officials viewed the apparent dispute as one over tactics, not goals. But when the Bosnian Serbs' Parliament ignored Mr. Milosevic and rejected the plan for a third time, he vowed to choke off the flow of material and equipment to the Bosnian Serbs' army, a force that he helped to create.
Administration officials said it was still too early to tell whether Serbia was carrying out Mr. Milosevic's pledge, but they said it was significant that Yugoslavia was offering to accept international monitors on its border in exchange for lifting the sanctions.
"The party's over," said one Administration official. "Cash is short for them. How much these guys have stashed away for a rainy day over the last year and a half, we can't be completely sure. But we know the rainy day is here."
The Serbs began the hostilities with an estimated $5 billion, the officials said. About $1.8 billion was frozen overseas by the first sanctions, and more than $1 billion in foreign deposits is believed to have been seized in recent weeks, they said. Several American officials estimate that Serbia's available "hard" currency -- dollars, German marks or British pounds -- is now below $1 billion. A recent article in the Belgrade weekly Vreme claimed reserves had fallen as low as $268 million.
 
A Chinese Refuge?
 Although the latest sanctions have substantially limited where Serbia can do business, Government officials said that China has emerged as one refuge for Serbian capital.
The officials said Russian companies were also continuing to do business with Serbia, defying the United Nations restrictions and throwing Mr. Milosevic a tenuous lifeline. In the years before the breakup of the old Yugoslav federation, the Soviet Union was its largest trading partner, and the breakup of the Soviet Union left Moscow with a debt to Serbia of several billion dollars that Belgrade has presumably called in.
The first round of United Nations sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia and Montenegro, were imposed last year. Though the sanctions were somewhat leaky, they and the war combined to send inflation soaring and led to a jobless rate of more than 50 percent.
Mr. Milosevic, a former banker, kept essential items flowing into Serbia through a web of more than 100 companies in Europe, Cyprus and the Far East. A provision of the United Nations sanctions permitted overseas branches of private Yugoslav companies to continue operations, providing the Serbs with badly needed cash. The overseas companies also played a role in such crucial covert efforts as fuel smuggling, officials said.
 
Seizure of All Assets
 The United Nations sanctions imposed last month took direct aim at the overseas companies, requiring member nations to freeze all Yugoslav assets. Rules were also tightened to eliminate the other chief means of sanctions-busting, under which goods labelled for transshipment through Yugoslavia were actually delivered in the country.
The sanctions gave new impetus to American demands that other countries detain the 23 Yugoslav tankers and freighters still sailing around the world. Administration officials said the bulk of the vessels now sail under Maltese flags, and in recent months, at least four have called on ports in China.
Cyprus, twice visited by American delegations, was among the first to take action against the overseas Yugoslav companies.
Michael E. Sherifis, Cyprus's Ambassador in Washington, said in an interview that under the new sanctions his country seized the assets of three Yugoslav banks and 53 companies totaling $450 to $500 million. While precise figures are not yet available, Administration an officials estimate that European nations tightened the squeeze further by freezing several hundred million dollars controlled by Serbian companies.
What one official characterized as a "chess game" between the Serbs and the sanctions enforcers continues. In recent months, officials said, "bag men" working for Mr. Milosevic have stashed millions of dollars of cash in bank vaults abroad. With the overseas transactions of Serbian-linked companies frozen, the Serbian Government has also begun hiding some of its assets in the private accounts of Serbs living overseas.
Evidence that sanctions have had an effect in Serbia can be seen in a proposal now being floated by Greece, Serbia's main ally in the region. The Greeks have said if the West was prepared to lift the United Nations sanctions, Serbia might accept international observers on its borders to monitor the enforcement of its cutoff of supplies to Bosnia. A senior Yugoslav official this week publicly proposed such an approach in an interview.
 
Tighter Than Iraqi Sanctions
 American officials said the sanctions against Serbia are now the strongest ever put into effect, and are much tighter than those currently in place against Iraq.
A C.I.A. study earlier this year said that sanctions alone were unlikely to stop the fighting in Bosnia in the immediate future, in part because Serbs there are already well supplied. But American officials and military experts in the region believe that a tight blockade by Mr. Milosevic against the Bosnian Serbs would help quell the conflict because they depend on Yugoslavia for fuel and spare parts.

HEADLINE: Rostenkowski Urges Clinton To Seek Support 'Out There'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
As he struggled to forge the tax legislation that is the core of President Clinton's economic program, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, suggested today that the President needed to generate more enthusiasm in the country for his plan if he hoped to get it enacted.
"The Administration, never having written a tax bill, doesn't understand that you have to get supporters out there, not exclusively in the House of Representatives or the Senate," Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, told reporters after meeting for hours with the other Democrats on his committee. 
 He continued: "You've got to get some people out there suggesting to the American people that this is good for the country and that large corporations and small businesses see in this bill an attractiveness for them to spend more money to create jobs. I'm trying to convince them that's important, and I think that on some ears the suggestions have fallen favorably."
 
His Experience Speaking
 Mr. Rostenkowski, who bears responsibility for getting the President's economic program started in Congress, spoke like an experienced sergeant pleading with his young commander for reinforcements. "It's very difficult to pass tax legislation," he declared.
In New York today, Mr. Clinton endorsed a proposal that would require that money raised by tax increases and saved by spending cuts be used to reduce the deficit.
Earlier this week Mr. Clinton traveled to Cleveland and Chicago to promote the economic package. Along with some other Chicago politicians, Mr. Rostenkowski had dinner with him Monday night.
These were Mr. Clinton's first trips out of Washington to promote his economic plan since his emergency spending bill was killed last month by a Senate filibuster, his popularity ratings began to drop and he conceded that his Presidency at the outset had lacked sufficient focus. It was not clear whether Mr. Rostenkowski was criticizing the trips this week as uninspiring or applauding them and asking for more.
In an interview this morning on WFAN radio in New York, Mr. Clinton said that some changes were being made by Congress to make his program better and that they "don't in any way undermine the fundamental principles of the tax program and the spending cuts program I laid out."
 
Crucial Committee Review
 The Ways and Means Committee is especially important because it gets first crack at writing tax measures, and Mr. Rostenkowski controls his committee the way a masterful conductor directs an orchestra.
No one doubts that the committee will approve a tax bill containing the main elements of the Clinton proposal: higher income tax rates for wealthy people and corporations, a new tax on fuel, taxes on a larger proportion of the Social Security benefits of upper- and middle-income retirees and more generous tax credits for the working poor.
And since tax measures are voted on by the House under rules that restrict amendments, the committee's work is likely to be adopted when it reaches the floor. But Mr. Rostenkowski is taking no chances, and he is working with the Administration to make changes around the edges that will make difficult votes easier to cast.
He said today that his goal was to structure a bill that could win support of a majority of representatives, but he may also have his eye on the Senate, where the Democratic majority is less solid than in the House and where the prospects for approval of the President's plan are less favorable.
 
Powerless Republicans
 Mr. Rostenkowski spent most of today with the other 23 Democrats on his committee around a conference table in his office on the second floor of the Capitol. The committee itself, which is required by the budget resolution approved last month to produce a tax bill by the end of this week, never met but is scheduled to convene Thursday morning.
The 14 Republicans on the panel are basically powerless when it comes to tax legislation. They said in advance that they would vote against any measure to raise taxes, so Mr. Rostenkowski has excluded them and concentrated on drafting a measure that can win solid support from the Democrats on his committee. That means the real work has gone on in his private meeting with the other Democrats.
A politician from head to toe, Mr. Rostenkowski would never ask colleagues to cast votes that would seriously jeopardize their standing at home. On the other hand, he says his job is to persuade others that they must sometimes abandon parochial interests for the good of the President and the country.
"I tell them Clinton's our President, and we ought to do everything we can to support him," Mr. Rostenkowski said.
 
Forcing Their Hands
 An associate who has watched Mr. Rostenkowski manipulate legislation for years said his strategy was to push committee votes up against the weekend deadline to force the hand of the other lawmakers. "Part of the dynamic for him," the associate said, "is to have them hit the wall -- to say if we don't throw some of our constituent interests overboard now, the whole thing is going to crash."
The main issues under discussion today seemed to be how to allocate the fuel tax in a way that would win the most possible political support and how to arrange corporate taxes to encourage investment.
Mr. Rostenkowski said his preference was to set the corporate tax rate no higher than 35 percent, although he said he was not sure he had a consensus on the committee for that view. The rate is now 34 percent, and the Administration wants to raise it to 36 percent.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Federated Net Aided By Controls

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The first-quarter results issued yesterday by Federated Department Stores Inc. demonstrated that attention to cost control could mitigate the impact of high markdowns and weak sales.
Federated's divisions, which consist of Abraham & Straus, Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Rich's and five other regional department store chains, were forced to take greater markdowns than planned in the quarter because severe weather and slowing sales threatened to clog inventories. But the company still managed a whopping 83.7 percent increase in profits before an extraordinary charge related to debt reduction, even though sales in stores open at least one year were less than planned. 
 The ability to clamp down on expenses has become the factor distinguishing winning retailers from the also-rans in the first quarter, when bad weather in most regions and increasing concerns about the economy slowed sales momentum.
Taking the special charge into account, Federated's net income in the first quarter increased 53.7 percent, to $18.2 million, from $11.8 million in the corresponding period last year. But sales inched up just 1.2 percent, to $1.59 billion from $1.57 billion.
 
Drop in Share Earnings
 Quarterly earnings per share fell to 14 cents from 15 cents because of a huge increase in the number of shares outstanding, which rose to about 126 million, from 80 million last year, because the company had its initial public offering in last year's second quarter.
Federated's stock climbed 87.5 cents yesterday, to $21.25, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
Comparatively, the company had few markdowns in the first quarter of last year, so it was up against a strong performance, analysts said.
"That this year, with markdowns and disappointing business, they have been able to do this shows a sign that they are tightening their belts," said Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associate Inc., a retail consulting firm. "With that kind of streamlining, I think this company has a dynamic growth pattern ahead."
But Federated's executives were cautious about the future, even though the company said sales had picked up this month.
"Although there are encouraging signs that sales are improving with the warmer weather in early May, we are continuing to view the remainder of 1993 with caution, reflecting consumer uncertainties about the economy and the impact of future tax and health-care funding proposals coming out of Washington," said Allen I. Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive.
Kimberly Walin, a retail analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said that even if sales did not pick up dramatically, changes in the company's distribution processes and centralization of accounts payable functions should help Federated continue to pare its costs.

HEADLINE: House Panel Backs Clinton Student-Loan Plan

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
The House Education and Labor Committee today approved President Clinton's proposal to allow needy students to borrow directly from the Federal Government to pay for college.
In a voice vote, the panel resisted lobbying by the banking industry and agreed to replace the current guaranteed student-loan program, which is highly profitable for private banks. But the new direct lending approach still faces strong opposition in the House, and even higher hurdles in the Senate. 
 Proponents argue that replacing the program would each year save the Federal Government $2 billion paid to lenders for defaulted loans and other costs, and that this would translate into lower interest rates for student borrowers. They also say the new program would free students and their parents from the confusing paperwork required by the banks.
"We are shifting from an entitlement to banks to an entitlement for students," said Representative Robert E. Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat who is a leading proponent of the overhaul.
But some Republican opponents argue that the new loan arrangement could become an administrative burden for the Education Department, creating a new and expensive bureaucracy. Representative Steve Gunderson, Republican of Wisconsin, predicted that the Government would have to borrow $20 billion to create the program. He urged that a more modest pilot project be adopted.
 
'Smoke and Mirrors'
 "This is the kind of smoke and mirrors that attracts support for Ross Perot," Mr. Gunderson said.
Under the current system, the Government guarantees the loans extended by private lenders, and reimburses money that is defaulted. The Government also pays the private lenders interest on loans while students are still in school, at a rate of 3.1 percent above the 91-day Treasury bill rate.
The banks make more profits from student loans than they do from mortgages or automobile loans, President Clinton has said.
Under the Clinton proposal, the Government would provide colleges with the money to lend to students. Colleges that did not want to approve or collect the loans could contract such work out to private companies.
Bankers' groups have been lobbying vigorously against the legislation, arguing that private industry can serve the students more efficiently than the Government. Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American Bankers Association, said, "We expect this plan to be just another failure in the Government's long history of taking over private enterprises."
In a visit to Illinois on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton depicted his plan as a matter of shaking up the Washington establishment. He took aim at the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, which buys student loans from banks, collects monthly payments and sells bonds secured by the loans to investors. Mr. Clinton accused Sallie Mae of hiring "seven of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington to try to stop this process from changing."
 
Resistance in Senate
 "There are a lot of people in Washington who want to keep the status quo," Mr. Clinton said.
A leading Democratic Senate strategist that Mr. Clinton would eventually be able to marshal enough support to enact the program. But there is resistance from a broad coalition of Senators. Some, like Senator Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Education, caution that the Government should first try a pilot project. Many Republicans are skeptical of taking a banking service from the private sector. And other Senators are sensitive to the argument from bank lobbyists that their states will lose banking jobs.
The student loan plan is part of a catch-all bill reconciling spending and taxes with deficit-reduction goals set by the Administration. The House Budget Committee requested that the panel make savings of $5.8 billion over five years, and the education committee believes that the new lending plan will save $4.3 billion.

HEADLINE: Shellshocked Island Has Had Enough of the Navy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIEQUES, P.R.

 BODY:
When the Pentagon recently announced its list of 165 military bases to be completely or partly closed, people here were angry and disappointed. Despite their best efforts, the Navy "weapons training facility" that occupies two-thirds of this small island just east of Puerto Rico was not placed on the list.
While communities throughout the United States are fighting to persuade the Base Closure and Realignment Commission not to close local military bases, nothing would please the 8,000 residents of Vieques (pronounced vee-ECK-es) more than to be rid of the military presence here. 
 Since the 1940's, the Atlantic Fleet has been bombing and shelling the island and the waters around it as part of military training exercises conducted from Roosevelt Roads Naval Station just across the straits, and the local people want it to stop.
 
'A Beautiful Place'
 "We're in bad shape here," said Luis Antonio Medina, president of the local fishermen's association. "This is a beautiful place, and a lot of things could be developed here, but we have nothing because the Navy has taken everything that is worth anything. It's an injustice that we have been fighting for a long time without success, but now we think our time has come."
Mr. Medina and other community leaders complained that the Navy, by taking over the area in World War II, had closed more than 22,000 acres to settlement or construction of hotels or factories. By its action, they said, the Navy forced thousands of Vieques natives to move to New York, San Juan or the Virgin Islands. Those who remain, they said, are prevented from farming in fields their families once owned, or have had their favorite fishing grounds closed for security reasons or destroyed by errant shells.
"The Navy presence here signifies an ecological disaster," said Robert Rabin, director of the local museum and the island's historian. "Many of the bombs miss their mark and fall into the water, damaging reefs and wildlife."
Because of the military restrictions, only the middle third of Vieques is inhabited. The western side is a weapons storage depot, and the eastern end is used to carry out amphibious landing and parachuting exercises as well as what the Navy delicately calls "ordnance delivery from aircraft and surface ships."
Mr. Rabin said that several people had been maimed over the years from picking up unexploded hand grenades and ammunition and that a drone aircraft crashed in a school yard in the early 1970's. There were no injuries in that incident.
 
Sorties and Explosions
 The latest round of exercises, called "Ocean Venture 93" and involving 20,500 American troops plus British, Dutch and French forces, began on April 20 and will continue through May 24. Throughout the day, the tropical calm and stillness is disrupted by the sound of jet sorties and bomb explosions that reverberate throughout the island. Residents say napalm is also being dropped.
A Navy spokeswoman, Lieut. Beth Jones, said that while some Marine Corps units had used napalm in the past, it was her understanding that none was being used in the current exercise.
Rafael Rivera Castano, a retired professor of medicine who is the son of a former mayor of Vieques, said local people had for years been told that the military exercises here were a bulwark against Communism. Now, he said, with the Soviet bloc having disintegrated, "Cuba no longer a threat, the Sandinistas out of power in Nicaragua and Noriega gone from Panama, that argument is no longer convincing."
In a recent statement explaining its position, the Navy said that the thousands of square miles of uncongested air space and ocean around Vieques are the only areas in which the Atlantic Fleet operates that can "allow all warfare components to train together in a realistic, integrated scenario." All exercises, the statement added, "are carried out according to strict safety regulations" with an eye to "preserving the environment on Vieques."
The arguments of Vieques residents have not been received with much sympathy in San Juan, either. The last thing the commonwealth's pro-statehood government can afford is to lose another pillar of the economy. Congress appears likely to revoke a tax break for American companies operating in Puerto Rico that has created more than 100,000 jobs, and fears are growing about competition with Mexico if the North American Free Trade Agreement is signed.
Originally built to counter a Nazi threat in the Caribbean and the Atlantic, Roosevelt Roads Naval Station currently employs about 3,000 civilians and pumps more than $200 million into the Puerto Rican economy each year in the form of salaries, construction work and purchases of supplies and services. But only a minuscule amount of that spending reaches Vieques.
Since Hurricane Hugo blew through here in 1989, more than $100 million has been spent to repair and modernize the base, and 90 percent of the $70 million in contracts to be let this year are likely to go to Puerto Rican companies.
 
'Colony of a Colony'
 On Vieques, however, the Puerto Rican Government's stance merely reinforces feelings that the island is, as the saying here goes, "the colony of a colony," largely ignored or forgotten. "When the San Juan television stations give the weather on the news, they don't even show Vieques on the map," said Jenny Benitez, a local businesswoman.
A delegation drawn from members of the Committee to Rescue and Develop Vieques, the leading opposition to the base, is scheduled to go to Washington in mid-May to urge Congress and Clinton Administration officials to add Vieques to the final base-closing list to be announced this summer. Although the group would like to see all Navy land returned as soon as possible, their immediate focus is the western third of the island.
"They only use that land to store bombs that could just as easily be put on Pineros," a small, uninhabited island just off Roosevelt Roads, said Ismael Guadalupe, a schoolteacher and committee leader who has led opposition to the Navy's presence since the 1970's. "That is the most viable and practical solution."
Should those lobbying efforts fail, Mr. Guadalupe said, "We'd have to think about a court case."
But, he added: "At the moment, we have faith. Our fingers are crossed."

HEADLINE: G.E. Deal Will Help Save GPA

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 12

 BODY:
GPA Group P.L.C. said late today that it had reached a deal under which the General Electric Company will help the giant aircraft-leasing company avert financial collapse. As part of the deal, G.E. would acquire 45 planes from GPA for $1.35 billion.
GPA said the deal could lead to G.E. owning as much as 80 percent of the Irish company. 
 General Electric already has a plane-leasing operation and is one of the two largest builders of jet engines, along with Pratt & Whitney. Should it exercise its option under the deal to acquire control of GPA, General Electric would become an even more powerful force in the aircraft industry.
 
Should Placate Creditors
 The late-night announcement of the deal by the two companies came after weeks of intensive negotiations and should ease the immediate fears of the banks and bondholders that are owed $5.5 billion by GPA, as well as aircraft builders like the Boeing Company. GPA is among the world's largest buyers of commercial jetliners.
Although executives involved in the negotiations said GPA had not yet overcome all of its troubles, they said there were signs that the deal with General Electric's GE Capital subsidiary, based in Stamford, Conn., would lead the banks and existing shareholders to provide $250 million in additional financing. That money would be crucial to GPA's efforts to avoid defaulting on bond payments of $220 million due over the next six weeks.
GPA, which is based in Shannon, Ireland, is to hold a previously scheduled meeting with bondholders in New York on Thursday. In its statement tonight, GPA said that if it could complete a deal for the additional financing and win approval from its banks, it expected to make all the bond payments.
 
Stock Offering Failed
 The deal, which must be approved by GPA's private shareholders, would effectively end the company's efforts to remain independent after a dizzying yearlong plunge that began when an ambitious $1 billion public stock offering failed last summer and had to be canceled.
GPA has since had to cancel billions of dollars in aircraft orders, hurting the order books of manufacturers like Boeing, while scrambling to raise cash for debt payments. It sought fruitlessly over the last several months to piece together a deal with its banks and shareholders.
"We are pleased with this agreement with GE Capital, a company that understands our business and is committed to the aircraft industry," said Tony Ryan, GPA's founder and chairman. "If agreed, the closer long-term association we are discussing will create a powerful global alliance which will lead the aircraft leasing and financing industry."
The companies said they were discussing making GPA in effect a subsidiary of GE Capital, with GPA's current management staying on to manage GPA's leasing business. They said they expect to complete those negotiations within a few days.
Under the deal, GPA would retain an unspecified equity interest in the 45 plans that it would sell to GE Capital for $1.35 billion. Meanwhile, GE Capital would help GPA sell additional jetliners and their leases to investors, with a goal of raising another $2 billion, the companies said.
GPA has historically used such sales to investors to raise cash for further aircraft purchases. The company is the primary supplier of leased planes to airlines, and it owns 460 aircraft, which are on lease to 113 airlines in 52 countries.
In return, GE Capital would be granted an option to acquire an equity interest in GPA of at least 65 percent, with the percentage perhaps going as high as 80 percent. The companies declined to disclose the price at which G.E. would be able to buy the stake. GPA had sought to sell its shares for $20 a share in its aborted public offering last year, but recently has been unable to raise additional equity from current shareholders at $1 a share.
 
New Bank Loans Possible
 Executives involved in the negotiations said GPA's 138 bank lenders, led by Citibank, had indicated that they were willing to lend an additional $100 million to the company. Existing shareholders, which are primarily financial institutions and airlines around the world, have also indicated they are willing to provide another $150 million to the company in the form of convertible preferred shares, the executives said.
But the executives stressed that there was no guarantee that deals would be completed with the banks and the shareholders, who have been negotiating with GPA for months.
G.E. had owned a 22 percent stake in GPA in the early 1980's and tried unsuccessfuly at the time to buy the entire company before selling its stake at a substantial profit.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher As European Rates Decline

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday after European interest rates dropped while American rates showed signs of remaining firm.
"The rate cuts in Europe helped push the dollar higher today," said Paul Farrell, chief dealer at Chase Manhattan. Lower interest rates make investments in a country less attractive, diminishing demand for its currency. 
 The dollar began to rise in European trading after Germany's central bank lowered important money market rates. Central banks in Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands followed by lowering official lending rates.
The dollar was also helped by the Government's report that producer prices rose an unexpected six-tenths of a percent in April, the biggest gain in two and a half years. The prospect that inflation may be accelerating makes it unlikely the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, which would undermine the dollar.
"After today's report, there's little chance that the Fed will ease rates," said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in New York.
Signs that some European central banks sold dollars for German marks capped the dollar's gains yesterday, traders said. The Bundesbank and others were said to be buying marks in preparation for a defense of the Spanish peseta, which has stumbled recently.
European central banks will need marks to sell for pesetas should the Spanish currency threaten to tumble out of the European Community's exchange rate mechanism, said John Nelson, chief dealer at Barclays Bank in New York.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.611 German marks, from 1.608 marks on Tuesday. The dollar was also quoted at 111.55 Japanese yen, up from 111.34 on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the British pound fell to $1.5350, from $1.5412 late on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Why the energy tax has turned into a political hard sell.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT was meant to be simple -- messy to administer, perhaps, but simple to sell to Congress. But now President Clinton's proposed levy on energy is in political trouble, and for reasons that apparently have a lot to do with the Administration's haste to raise maximum revenue with minimum political pain.
The President may yet be able to build a winning political coalition for the levy. But tinkering will not save Mr. Clinton from the interest group collision he hoped to avoid. 
 The reasoning behind the proposal, pieced together by analysts sympathetic to the Administration, went something like this:
Tens of billions of dollars would be needed to meet the President's budget goals, and there were limits to how much more could, or should, be squeezed from income taxes. Energy, by contrast, would make a fecund cash cow. And since overall consumption would not change much in response to modest price increases, producers would not squawk because they would be able to pass the tax through to users the way retailers pass on general sales taxes.
Besides, there would be brownie points to score with environmentalists, who never met a tax on fossil fuels they did not like. An energy levy might even take some wind out of Ross Perot's sails, since he favored a stiff gasoline tax.
The most neutral energy tax is one on the heat content of fuels -- a B.T.U. tax. But the tax really need not be neutral, the reasoning went, because coal and oil do more environmental damage per B.T.U emitted. The surcharge on coal did not survive: Coal was already scheduled to take a hit under the Clear Air Act of 1990, and coal-state Democrats served notice they would not sit still for another. But the surcharge on oil did, doubling the proposed tax per barrel. All told, the Administration estimated, the typical family would pay a mere $300 a year more to save the future from the debt sins of the fathers.
So what went wrong? Technical glitches, such as a loophole that would have given foreign oil refiners a cost advantage over domestic competitors, were easily plugged. And a few interest group objections, including the prohibition on listing the tax as a separate line on utility bills, were easily accommodated. But there was no comparable repair for the Administration's misconception that the tax would be spread so thin that no one would bother to make a Federal case of it.
Actually, gasoline does fit the Administration's model. Since the price of gasoline per B.T.U. is very high, the tax amounts to just 7 percent of the cost at the pump. And since there are no ready substitutes, consumers would no doubt hunker down and pay.
But the heavy heating oil used in industrial boilers is a different story. The price per B.T.U. is relatively low, so the tax amounts to a quarter of the current price. And unlike gasoline, heavy heating oil competes in the marketplace directly with natural gas and coal.
Indeed, notes Philip Verleger of the Institute for International Economics, many utilities routinely switch from fuel to fuel to save their customers a few pennies a month. And since the B.T.U. tax would add just 5 percent to the price of natural gas, heating oil producers would have to eat most of the cost to stay in the game. "It's a tax on heavy oil from California, Mexico and Venezuela," said Mr. Verleger -- one that ironically "works to the advantage of light oil producers including Libya and Algeria."
Or consider farmers, whose fuel-hungry machines make it possible for a single family to cultivate thousands of acres of grain. They could not pass through the extra tax to buyers because grain prices are set by world markets. Nor could long-haul truck drivers, who must compete for freight with far more energy-efficient railroads. Thus, even if the President muscles the bill through the House, he will face determined special interests in the more hostile Senate.
The easiest way out, says Larry Goldstein of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, would be to drop the surcharge on oil, perhaps recapturing the revenue with a higher rate on all fuels. That would disarm the interests most at risk from the tax on oil products.
A better way, Mr. Goldstein argues, would be to recognize the B.T.U. tax for what it is: a flawed method for raising a lot of money in a hurry. He would pass an energy levy now, with the proviso that within two years it be folded into a broad-based tax on consumption -- something on the order of a national sales tax or value-added tax.
Such a tax is probably in the works anyway, he notes, since the Administration will have to find $50 billion to $100 billion a year as a reliable source of revenue to cover the cost of national health insurance. The politics of the switch, of adding a percentage point or two to the consumption tax in order to jettison the B.T.U. tax would, at worst, be a wash.

HEADLINE: 'I Love Tourism': 3 States Try To Resume Luring Visitors

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 12

 BODY:
Fifteen years after New York tourism officials imprinted the phrase "I Love New York" on the nation's collective consciousness and "New Jersey and You" seemed so perfect together, efforts to promote the metropolitan region as a travel destination are emerging from their darkest hour.
New York and New Jersey, which had television promotion campaigns throughout the 1980's, went off the air in the early 1990's because of state budget cuts. Connecticut has not had an active statewide travel promotion for seven years, an eternity in building the kind of recognition that marketers say is needed to influence decisions on where to take a vacation. 
 But this spring, all three states are preparing to re-enter the tourist marketing fray. Connecticut has begun a $3 million television and print campaign -- its biggest ever -- with the eager phrase, "We're full of surprises!" aimed at weekend travelers from New York and New Jersey. New York, bolstered by a doubling of its promotion budget this year, is preparing a television campaign on its tried and true "I <heart> NY" theme for later this month. New Jersey officials hope to resume marketing out of state this summer with new money proposed by Gov. Jim Florio.
"It was about obliterated," said Stuart Schulman, an associate professor of travel and tourism at Kingsborough Community College in New York, who helped create the "I Love New York" campaign in the 1970's, then watched the effort dwindle. "Somehow the connection has been re-established that tourism is not fluff."
But much has changed, and in the patterns of tourism, since the heady days when everyone from Frank Sinatra to Thomas H. Kean and Susan St. James was pitching various corners of the Northeast. Even with the new resources, the efforts are a pallid reflection of past efforts. The $7 million committed to the "I Love New York," campaign this year, for example, is more than twice as much as the state spent last year. Just four years ago, however, the marketing budget was $15 million.
Across much of the region, the tourism and travel industry itself stagnated as the states were retrenching, but travel experts say the causes are more complex than the lack of a good sales pitch. Fewer business conventions and tighter corporate purse strings for business travelers, higher hotel taxes and limited household budgets in the recession all contributed, they say.
In New York State, traditionally the nation's No. 3 tourist destination after California and Florida, 40,000 travel industry jobs were lost in 1991, 8,000 in New York City alone, according to the state. Tourist visits and hotel occupancy rates have fallen in a wide swath through Westchester County and in northern New Jersey, which had thrived for years on corporate meetings located conveniently near golf courses.
 
Eras Come and Go
 Eras have come and gone as well. "Better Yet, Connecticut," for example, gave way to "Classic Connecticut," while "New Jersey's Got It!" begat "New Jersey and You," which begat "New Jersey, You Should See Us Now," the state's current slogan. Foreign tourists, lured by favorable exchange rates and falling political barriers, have become a bigger factor than ever.
Perhaps most important, tourism experts say, more and more Americans no longer take the kind of extended summer vacations they did even 10 or 15 years ago, instead taking short, often spontaneous trips, closer to home, often planned around a specific event or activity.
"Ten or 15 years ago, two weeks was the standard," said Ed Dombroskas, executive director of the tourism division at the Connecticut Department of Economic Development. "Five years ago, it went to a week. It's now three to four days. In the past few years, the economy has pressurized us all. We need more breaks."
But if shorter, closer-to-home vacations are the wave of the future, the next question for marketers is, What do these travelers want: relaxation or excitement? Leafy bucolic getaways or mini-adventures? And do vacationers, upon packing up the mini-van, really want "surprises," as Connecticut promises? Holiday Inn, to cite a contrary example, based its advertising for years on the opposite tack, promising travelers they would find "no surprises."
How short will the vacation of the future become if the trend toward abbreviation continues? In New Jersey, for instance, the number of tourist visits actually increased in 1992, rising to 136 million in 1992 from 127 million in the previous year. But a majority of the new visitors were what are known as "drive-throughs," who came for the day, then kept on going or went home. The number of such one-day visits rose from 110 million to 115 million, according to figures from the State Department of Commerce and Economic Development.
"Our overnight market is decreasing," said Eugene Dilbeck, the State Director of Travel and Tourism.
 
The Casino Factor
 In Connecticut, by contrast, travel experts say that tourism is increasing as perhaps never before, largely because of the Foxwoods Casino, which opened last year on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation in Ledyard. The casino has drawn an average of 12,000 gamblers a day since it opened in February 1992, making it, almost overnight, the biggest tourist attraction in the state.
Travel and tourism was Connecticut's ninth largest employer in 1990, according to the most recent figures from Travel Industry Association of America, a trade group. In New Jersey, by contrast, travel was the third largest employer, while in New York, it was the second largest. In 37 states, it was the first, second, or third largest employer, according to the travel association.
"Connecticut is seen by many people as the thing you have to do to get from New York to Boston," said Lalia Rach, dean of the school of hotel, restaurant and tourism administration at the University of New Haven. "I don't think there is a well-defined image in the minds of consumers." Professor Rach praised the state's new commitment, especially the new dedicated fund for tourism promotion, using a $1-a-day tax on rental cars. But she said she thought more of the campaign should be broadcast within the state.
"You have to change the minds of the locals," she said. "Connecticut doesn't see itself as a destination."
Economic realities may change that. In the area around the casino, more than 1,000 hotel rooms are expected to be built by the end of this year, a 33 percent increase from the current 3,200 rooms. Casino officials say that about 50 percent of their customers are from out of state, mostly from Massachusetts and Rhode Island, but with about 15 percent from New York and New Jersey.
The tribe has also committed $1 million a year to a marketing campaign to push the New London County area, including television ads that began in the New York market last year. A new series of television spots for the casino and the region is to begin on New York stations this weekend.
In New York City, travel industry officials say they have been weakened by a 5 percent state tax imposed in 1990 on hotel rooms costing more than $100 a night. The tax has pushed the total hotel tax in the city, where almost every room costs more than $100, to 21.25 percent, the highest in the nation, and ignited a revolt among many tour operators and convention organizers.
Mayflower Tours of Downers Grove, Ill., for example, which brings about 25 tours a year to New York City, now uses hotels in New Jersey, partly because of the tax, the company's president, John Stachnik, said.
 
'Usurious' Tax
 The Professional Convention Management Association, a trade group for convention operators, formally recommended last year that its 3,100 members avoid New York until the tax is lifted. A spokesman for the organization, Roy B. Evans, said his members conduct about 125,000 meetings a year around the country, booking an average of 27 million room-nights a year.
"As long as that tax is at such a usurious level, we will not bring our meeting to New York," Mr. Evans said.
While New York State is taking to the airwaves again, its commercials will not focus solely on New York City, as they have in the past. Officials say that even with new money in the budget, there is not enough for a statewide campaign and a separate city campaign.
What will not change is the slogan. "I Love New York," they say, is here to stay.
The fact that "I Love New York" has endured, even as New Jersey and Connecticut have adopted new slogans, shows that New York may have stumbled on a deeper truth, beyond slogans, said Professor Donald E. Hawkins, director of the International Institute of Tourism Studies at George Washington University.
"I would call that the essence of authenticity," he said.

New York Refinancing Correctional Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Strong investor demand and low interest rates continue to encourage bond refundings, in which proceeds are used to pay off bonds sold when rates were higher.
Taking advantage of the opportunity yesterday was the New York State Urban Development Corporation, which priced $670 million of correctional facilities revenue bonds through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company. 
 Part of the financing was $523.6 million in correctional facilities revenue bonds, called the 1993 refunding series, initially priced to yield a maximum 6.04 percent for a bond due in 2015. Serial bonds with shorter maturities were priced to yield from 5 percent in 1999 to 5.60 percent in 2004.
Among the bonds to be refunded with the proceeds of the offering are securities with interest rates of 7.50 percent to 8.125 percent.
Other long maturities in yesterday's offering were priced to yield 5.875 percent in 2007, 5.60 percent in 2012, 6.02 percent in 2013 and 5.65 percent in 2018.
Underwriters noted that the bond due in 2012 is insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation and that the bond due in 2018 is insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation. The insurance gives those securities a triple-A rating by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation. All other maturities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and BBB by S.& P.
The offering priced yesterday included $41.71 million in capital appreciation bonds. These securities pay no interest, but if held to maturity will yield 6.20 percent for issues due in 2008 to 2010.
 
Second Portion
 The second part of the refinancing was $105 million of correctional capital facilities revenue bonds, which were priced to yield a maximum 6.05 percent for a maturity in 2018. The shorter-maturity serial bonds were priced to yield from 3.25 percent in 1994 to 5.60 percent in 2004.
Long maturites in 2007 and 2013 were priced to yield 5.875 percent and 6.02 percent, respectively, with capital appreciation bonds due in 2008 through 2010 yielding 6.20 percent.

Price of Gold Surges $4.50 On Prospects for Inflation

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Prices of precious and industrial metals surged yesterday after the Government reported that inflation on the producer level had risen six-tenths of 1 percent in April, its largest increase in two and a half years.
"Inflation is always a plus for gold and silver in particular, as well as for industrial metals," said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst at Prudential Securities. 
 Gold for June delivery jumped $4.50, to $361.80 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. July silver futures gained 11.9 cents, to $4.392 an ounce.
Analysts said yesterday's rally was also fueled by concerns that the surging Asian demand for gold would outstrip supplies. June gold futures have climbed $23.60 an ounce, or about 7 percent, in the last month.
"I think this would have happened without the increase in the P.P.I.," said Ian McDonald, vice president of the precious metals division at Credit Suisse in New York. "The writing was on the wall. There's a supply shortage at a time when interest rates are low and the stock market is floundering."
 
Copper in Rebound
 Copper futures, meanwhile, rebounded from the five-and-a-half- year lows set last week, on concern about coming labor negotiations at copper mines in Chile, the world's largest producer.
"There's the feeling the market bottomed out last week, just at the upper range of production costs, which is about 77 cents a pound for most of the major producers," Ms. Raptopoulos said.
July copper closed at 82.25 cents a pound, up 2.65 cents, at the Comex.
On other commodity markets, orange juice surged for the third straight session while energy futures slumped.
Orange juice for July delivery climbed to its highest price since October, settling at 105.60 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange, up 2.90 cents. Analysts said there was speculation that Brazilian orange juice processors would produce less juice and raise the prices of their exports.
Oil futures fell after reports that American refineries processed more crude oil last week. Crude oil for June delivery closed 14 cents lower at $20.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil for June delivery finished 0.77 cent lower at 55.14 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline for June delivery finished 0.51 cent lower at 60.63 cents a gallon.

Taxable and Tax-Free Funds Have Lower Yields in Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were down in the latest week. Analysts said there appeared to be little chance that money market fund yields would rise or fall sharply soon.
IBC's Money Fund Report said yesterday that its latest survey showed tax-exempt money fund yields were down in the week ended Tuesday after a sharp rise the previous week. Yields were off an average 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, as investors moved $918 million into tax-free money funds, bringing total assets to $99.6 billion. 
 Money managers moved to lower the average days left to maturity of securities held in portfolios to 48, from 49.
IBC/Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt money market fund fell 5 basis points, to 1.96 percent, and the average seven-day simple yield fell a similar amount to 1.94 percent. Analysts said that over the last 30 days, the compounded yield was averaging 1.99 percent and the simple yield about 1.97 percent.
Yields may also be down because of continuing demand by investors for tax-exempt investments as a hedge against future tax increases. Such demand has put a premium on new issues, raising prices and lowering yields.
Without state and local taxes, the taxable-bond equivalent yield for the average seven-day yield was about 2.72 percent for investors in the 28 percent bracket and about 2.84 percent for those in the 31 percent bracket.
Among the tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, the Money Fund Report said the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market fund was on top for the third consecutive week, continuing to be one of the better performers this year. The fund had a yield of 2.61 percent, down 3 basis points from the previous week.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for the Money Fund Report, said he did not see yields making any significant moves soon and that they would continued to bounce in a narrow range.
"Yesterday's disappointing Producer Price Index number was nowhere as ominous as it looked if you looked at it closely," Mr. Frank said. "While once more appearing that the Fed was going to move toward lowering short-term rates, this recent inflation news puts a damper on that speculation."
 
Taxable Funds
 For the week ended yesterday, the assets of taxable money market funds rose $3.7 billion, to $491.3 billion, with institutional funds accounting for $3.2 billion of the inflow, to a total $177.4 billion.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios was unchanged at 63 for the third consecutive week.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compounded yield on a taxable fund was down 3 basis points, to 2.62 percent, with the seven-day simple yield down the same amount, to 2.59 percent. The compounded average yield over 30 days was 2.65 percent, while the simple yield was 2.62 percent.
The top general-purpose fund in the most recent week and in the last month was the Dreyfus Basic Money Market fund, which reported a return of 3.44 percent, down a basis point from the previous week.
Meanwhile, banks, which compete directly with money market funds for investor cash, were offering a yield of 2.54 percent, or two basis points lower than in the previous week.

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
As the Shelter World Turns

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
I AM looking at a 23-year-old shingled house by a pond in suburban Chicago, contemplating the meaning of zing. It is the presence of zing, "in all its colorful forms," Traditional Home magazine says, that makes this house such a joy to behold.
You would not have found the word zing in HG, a magazine that has long served as an urbane arbiter of taste. But throughout their history, home magazines have been a Rorschach test of American values. If the announcement of HG's closing and the rise of magazines like Traditional Home are any indication, Americans have grown weary of visual repartee. Forget cutting edge. They want zing. 
 Shelter magazines have grown up with America. Though they may seem fluffy (see "Soft Spots: Handmade pillows to cushion life's bumps" in Martha Stewart Living), they have historically reflected broad cultural shifts that transcend ad pages and other publishing concerns. In the early 1980's, the retooling of House and Garden, rechristened HG, and Metropolitan Home heralded the era of the Masters of the Universe a la "Bonfire of the Vanities."
Today, magazines like Traditional Home, which shun chrome and look to suburban Chicago and Tulsa, Okla., for inspiration, seem to reflect the generational shift in values symbolized by the 1992 Presidential election.
If Architectural Digest is like Nancy Reagan's gaze, cool and remote, the Traditional Homes of the world try to be as accessible as Bill Clinton's bear hugs. They feel our pain. They are Little Rock, not Santa Barbara or Kennebunkport. "Style isn't selling anymore," said Martha Stewart, ruminating on the crop of voyeuristic "dream books" that defined the 1980's. "The idea of looking has had its time."
The emphasis on traditional design and how-to stories about real people -- what House Beautiful's editor in chief, Louis Oliver Gropp, calls "the new realism" -- is in a sense a return to the shelter magazines of old, which taught women how to produce the perfect setting for the perfect American family. To John Mack Carter, the head of magazine development for the Hearst Corporation, the roll-up-your-sleeves orientation of today's magazines has resulted in the triumph of "the thumb print" over the coffee table.
The earliest shelter magazines, born in the 1880's, tried to ask, "What is home?" rather than, "What can I buy for it?" "People thought houses conveyed values," said Mary Corbin Sies, a historian at the University of Maryland. Houses were vehicles for the American democratic ideal.
Shelter magazines were also esthetic bibles and social instructors. Caroline Seebohm, who has written a biography of Conde Nast, says House and Garden was meant to do for interiors what Conde Nast had done with fashion: help the socially insecure, including the wives of railroad barons "who had huge houses on Fifth Avenue and didn't know what to do with them."
Home magazines' fortunes have always waxed and waned with the economy, foundering during World War I, for example, and booming after World War II. A 1955 edition of House and Garden was dedicated to "the over 1,600,000 young couples" who would marry that year and decorate their first home, aided by the magazine's yearly color proclamations.
The early 1980's were clearly a Zen moment for shelter magazines. In 1969, the Meredith Corporation issued a one-shot special-interest publication tailored to the post-collegiate bricks-and-boards crowd called Apartment Ideas: the Magazine of Better Apartment Living. In 1974, the magazine became Apartment Life. Apartment Life profiled bearded men in dashiki shirts playing the flute while building bookcases and sensitive-looking couples eating quiche together in bed.
In 1981, the magazine switched its name to Metropolitan Home and became a grown-up sophisticate enraptured with design. Like House and Garden, which also switched focus in that period, Met Home went off in pursuit of what William F. Bondlow Jr., House and Garden's publisher at the time, called the "movers and groovers." The groovers were equipped with discretionary income, education, a lust for the good life. The objects of their desire filled the dreamiest dream book of them all, Architectural Digest.
In the mid to late 80's, ad pages of high-end shelter magazines were as pumped up as their readers' biceps. Since the late 1980's, says William Kerr, executive vice president of Meredith, there has been "an equally great collapse."
Met Home fell prey to lackluster circulation growth and a standstill in the furniture industry, Mr. Kerr said. Meredith, based in Des Moines, recently sold Met Home to Hachette Publications, which owns two other shelter magazines, Elle Decor and Home, and has made Met Home a bimonthly.
But the reincarnated Met Home has lost the zeal and graphic punch of those heady days -- when innovative work by architects and designers was fueled by the economy and each month offered an endless, exhausting array of design trends.
Mr. Kerr thinks that high-style design magazines may have had their day. "Like Andy Warhol's 15 minutes, 'design' and 'style' were a hot subject five or six years ago, just as today 'family' is a hot subject," he said. "Home and family are a more enduring phenomenon."
Dorothy Kalins, Met Home's longtime editor in chief, observed: "We were breaking new ground, but maybe aging baby boomers don't want 'new' in their lives. They're putting their 2-year-olds to bed instead of shopping for Philippe Starck lamps."
Like voters rejecting trickle-down economics, shelter readers may have become fed up with a dream that was unattainable. As Barbara Caplan, a director of Yankelovich Partners, a market research concern that advises shelter magazines, said, "The new status is feeling good about yourself, feeling comfortable, realizing that all that stuff didn't bring happiness."
Ms. Kalins thinks readers still want shelter magazines. "Every life stage, whether it's having a baby or getting a divorce, demands a physical change in living space," she said.
Or as Eckart L. Guthe, Conde Nast's vice president for corporate research, put it, "The nostalgia quotient is up, and people are looking for things that are safe, with everlasting beauty, which are not banged around by fads."
Enter the new-old shelter magazine, designed to be "family friendly" in Mr. Kerr's words, a trend some are calling de-decorating. Under the editorship of Mr. Gropp, House Beautiful, has combined its how-to tradition with a breezy, unpreachy writing style. In recent issues, it has addressed the subject of environmentally sensitive architecture as well as propped rooms of Baker Furniture. Country Living, also published by Hearst, veers more toward Bed & Breakfast Adorable, with silhouetted roosters on the chandeliers.
Country Home, published by Meredith, deals in elegant nostalgia. Its three-and-a-half-year-old sister, Traditional Home (circulation already 675,000), is more upscale, geared to affluent suburban readers who want comfortable squishy sofas.
Perhaps the most heralded new arrival has been Martha Stewart Living, a bimonthly published by Time Publishing Inc. Ventures. It is a hybrid, a classy how-to magazine. Ms. Stewart's regular appearances on the "Today" show have helped establish a circulation of 725,000, fanned by the Martha wanna-be factor.
Ms. Stewart wants her readers to read the magazine the way they would a cookbook. The thinking is that although they can't afford a Peter Marino house, they want to stencil their walls as he does (an approach that melds "inspiration" with "information," said the publisher, Eric G. Thorkilsen). Of course, working parents may not have time to stencil, but the fantasy is there.
"Reagan took us through glitz and glamour," said Jean LemMon, who last week became editor in chief of Better Homes and Gardens (the largest, with a circulation of 7.6 million) after a seven-year stint at Country Home. "Now unemployment is high, jobs aren't secure. It means we're going to have to find ways to enjoy life that don't cost a lot of money -- puttering around the house or inviting friends over for a chili supper."
Chili suppers are not part of the picture at Architectural Digest, the imperious queen of shelter magazines. In its pages, which have changed little in recent years, decorators are stars and real people are nowhere to be found. But like the British royal family, even Architectural Digest, which has wafted over the scene like Glinda's bubble, may have to let the commoners in, taking in the occasionally quirky, like the English magazine World of Interiors, and perhaps a bit of irony.
The magazines exist in a moment in which Kaki Hockersmith, a little-known decorator from Little Rock, is redesigning the private quarters of the White House. "It's a sensible time," said John Mack Carter. "Rather than dreaming, people want things that work. They want knobs that work, houses that work."
In other words, the mandate for shelter magazines is not unlike the one given to Bill Clinton and the economy, with the same expectations and sense of frustration. It's the slipcovers, stupid.

BYLINE: By Peter M. Nichols

 BODY:
Action movies deliver thrills on screen, and as Hollywood has discovered, they also make for a star-studded breed of interactive video game. Thanks to the multi-media compact disk, called CD-ROM, the Arnold Schwarzeneggers and Sylvester Stallones can jump into the contest, too.
"Real characters are better to interact with than those little green guys," said Peter Dille of Sony Imagesoft, which produces video games for the corporation that owns the Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star studios and Columbia Tri-Star Home Video. 
 The green characters are a reference to the video-game craze that came and went in the early 1980's. These days Mr. Dille's company and others like Sega and Electronic Arts, the world's largest interactive software producer, are developing advanced games with sound and graphics that one day might approximate the movies themselves.
Last year Sony released a game based on "Hook," with players advancing from level to level on a quest with Peter Pan. In the future there will be Sony games spun off from "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " and two coming films from Tri-Star and Columbia, "Cliffhanger," with Mr. Stallone, and "The Last Action Hero," with Mr. Schwarzenegger.
The 16-bit games, which can process more information on their wider data path, can be played on a Sega Genesis machine that has an attachment for reading the large-capacity compact disks, the CD-ROM. Like other video games, the new ones involve quests or missions that progress from one level of difficulty to the next. As with the old games, the object is to win, but CD-ROM games offer players more varied situations and options. The goal is a greater degree of reality and a higher level of entertainment.
"Games are fast and have a lot of moving characters," said Ellen Beth Van Buskirk of Sega, which will issue a game this summer tied to "Jurassic Park," the Steven Spielberg film that opens June 11. For games on disk, clips from the films can be used, but the action is less than full motion. Stars might appear to offer pointers or take part in some other way.
The aura of the film business has overtaken the game industry. Sega, for example, has built a $10 million studio in Redwood City, Calif., where film-trained graphics artists and technicians make all kinds of games, from sports to movie-related. For its movie games, Sega seeks ties with Hollywood. "We want to get in on the front end, see what kind of footage we can get," Ms. Van Buskirk said.
At Sony and other studios' own game divisions, the game makers have the advantage of being in the studio already. "We have early access to scripts and sets," Mr. Dille said.
In the planning stages are more powerful 32-bit games to be played on a new machine promised by 3DO of San Mateo, Calif. "The use of those extra 16 bits is to make the audio and video sound and look more like television than an interactive video game," said Stewart Bonn of Electronic Arts. In 32-bit games, he added, players might also be able to control the plot line.
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES
 
A River Runs Through It
1992. Columbia Tri-Star. $94.95. Laser disk, $39.95. 123 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.
 Robert Redford's reverent version of Norman Maclean's memoir about family and male ritual on the trout streams of Montana can follow the book only so far. With its handsome tableaux and sturdy characterizations, the film contributes a seriousness of purpose. Craig Sheffer is the scholarly and passive Maclean, with Brad Pitt as his livelier brother and Tom Skerritt as their stiff, austere father. An uncanny director of actors, Mr. Redford is able to convey the distances between men. But, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, the film remains "more a homage to its source material than a work of comparable emotion or breadth."
 
Glengarry Glen Ross
1992. LIVE. $94.98. Laser disk, $34.95. 100 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
 It's crunch time in a Chicago real estate office where the most productive salesman will win a Cadillac Eldorado and the least successful will find himself on unemployment. Directed adeptly by James Foley, David Mamet's adaptation of his 1984 Broadway play ups the level of psychic desperation. With expanses of Florida scrub land to peddle in the kitchens of the unsuspecting, the smooth Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), the highest-powered of the sales crew, is off and running. The rest (Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin and Jonathan Pryce) are a sweaty bunch in a time of tight money and waffling clients. Using Mr. Mamet's gift for language. Mr. Foley delivers a "living film that preserves the claustrophobic nature of the original stage work" (Canby).
 
Ted and Venus
1991. Columbia Tri-Star. $89.95. Closed captioned. R.
 Ted (Bud Cort), a dissipated drifter, falls for Linda (Kim Adams), a pretty social worker he spies on the beach in Venice, Calif. With a courting technique that veers from dopey humor to obscene phone calls, Ted doesn't get very far. Still, Mr. Cort's film has an interesting cast (with Jim Brolin as a hard-drinking hipster and Gena Rowlands as Linda's mother) and "a vivid sense of the numerology, yoga classes and dulcimer lessons that color California beach life, circa 1974" (Janet Maslin).
 
Zentropa
1992. Touchstone. $94.95. Laser disk, $39.99. 112 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
 After the war a German-American pacifist (Jean-Marc Barr) goes to post-Nazi Germany to help out in the restoration. There he takes a job at a giant railway terminal called Zentropa and finds himself in a futuristic nightmare in which stony-faced crowds wander a bleak landscape. With this as its platform, Lars von Trier's film devotes itself to high-flown allusions to celebrated film technique, "becoming a sarcastic comic meditation about cinematic myth-making and the relationships between Hollywood, Europe and World War II" (Stephen Holden).

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks in Puerto Rico

 BODY:
Only infrequently, and then fitfully, do mainland Americans pay much attention to their offshore ward Puerto Rico. Many islanders now fear their vulnerable economy will be devastated by a Clinton Administration deficit reduction proposal. These fears could well be overblown, but 3.5 million Puerto Ricans are owed a better demonstration that Treasury Department mandarins have responsibly done their homework.
President Clinton has endorsed, and Congress is weighing, a Treasury proposal to amend Section 936 of the tax code that gives U.S. companies an exemption from Federal taxes on income earned in Puerto Rico. This tax break, which extends to interest on local bank deposits, is seen in Washington as an excessive giveaway whose prudent trimming can yield $7 billion over five years. 
 Treasury is doing its job in taking aim at all such long-encrusted tax breaks. But grievously, it has failed to spell out potential damage to an island where unemployment is 18 percent, or more than twice the mainland rate. Hence the outcry in Puerto Rico.
And thus the need for thorough hearings by the House Ways and Means Committee, as urged by Representative Charles Rangel of New York.
Puerto Ricans say that 110,000 islanders are employed by businesses benefiting from Section 936, or 70 percent of all manufacturing jobs. Treasury retorts that the chief beneficiaries have been capital-intensive pharmaceutical companies; it proposes a far less costly tax incentive related directly to payrolls. But Puerto Ricans insist that this would mean the loss of high-skill jobs and the flight of pharmaceuticals, either to Mexico or to Asian competitors.
One unanswered question is how much of this offshore wealth is recouped by parent companies on the mainland, without tangible benefit to islanders. Another is why Puerto Rico has not outgrown its dependence on a tax crutch. And a third is whether Section 936 has provided too generous a relocation subsidy to mainland companies.
These matters call for sensible responses. Amending Section 936 need not be devastating if more narrowly targeted incentives are formulated. But care is surely in order to prevent wanton damage to islanders, who for all their progress average an annual income of $6,200, or half that of Mississippi, the poorest of the 50 states.
Finally, a measure of extra fairness is owed to a territory acquired as war booty in 1898. Puerto Rico's inhabitants became citizens through conquest, not choice. A careful Ways and Means Committee hearing is the minimally decent obligation owed by a negligent landlord.

The Kurdish Example

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Remember those gut-wrenching pictures two years ago of Kurdish villagers fleeing the wrath of the defeated Saddam Hussein, tearfully abandoning their homes, children freezing in the snow?
The nation's horror at the sight of that first televised exodus drove George Bush into doing what his advisers warned against: intervening in the complex internal affairs of Iraq, with all its ancient ethnic hatreds and vengeful savagery. U.S. air cover sealed off most of the Kurdish portion of northern Iraq, creating a haven for the targets of genocide. 
 Let's see how our intervention, so ardently derided by geo-pragmatists as prelude to some awful national "dismemberment," is working out.
Kurdish tribes and clans have stopped bickering and elected a parliament, forming a united front with Iraqi Shiites and Sunnis against Saddam.
Cooperating with Turkey to the north, where 10 million Kurds live, Pesh Merga fighters behind Massoud Barzani successfully took on the Marxist terrorist Kurds. This helps remove Turkish fears of a territorial threat from an autonomous region that might turn into an independent country called Kurdistan.
With about $50 million in U.S. farm equipment and seed grain, the nascent democracy has begun to feed and shelter its four million people. Two universities have been opened.
But the Kurds in the mountains are by no means out of the woods. Saddam has canceled the currency, sealed off crossing points and raised the price of produce to pull the food out of the Kurdish area. Life is hard; the freed Kurds need help; but they are no longer being wiped out.
Quietly, two weeks ago, a delegation of Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites including Massoud Barzani came to Washington. Accustomed to being shunted off to a third assistant nobody in the Bush Administration, they were received by Vice President Gore, Secretary of State Christopher and national security adviser Lake.
"We accept their verbal assurances," Mr. Barzani tells me, that the troubling Clinton desire to "depersonalize" the conflict with Saddam means only that any successor regime will be expected to comply fully with the cease-fire terms; that there is no chance for normalization with Saddam or a similar dictator; and that the U.S. seeks a democratic alternative to the present regime. (I'd like to see that in writing, but the "memcon" recording the policy is needlessly classified.)
Beyond the continuance of our air cover, what do the Kurds need to stay free and develop their nation? No U.S. troops. Only emergency economic aid of $150 million this year; and what they don't talk about publicly, antitank and antiaircraft weapons in case Saddam attacks and the world is afflicted with Bosnianitis.
And they need a way to get oil out of their ground. Although oil-rich Kirkuk, which will one day be the capital of Kurdistan, is still under Saddam's occupation, both Taqtaq and Zakho in Kurdish control cry out for mobile refineries. If State will get the U.N. to permit the needed suspension of the Iraqi sanctions, and will prevail on Turkey to allow overland transportation, the Kurds are confident financing can be found to begin making their region self-sufficient.
The soft-spoken Barzani, 46, son of the legendary Mullah Mustafa and father of eight, is not pushy; he observes the taboo about talking of independence; but on the urgent need for economic and diplomatic aid, even after all the top-level meetings in Washington, "I have no answers for my people."
The Kurds deserve answers. They are no longer ignored: Ray Bonner's on-the-scene reporting in The New Yorker, and Graham Fuller's analysis in the current Foreign Affairs, underscore the value of democratic movements in the Middle East. (Only the U.S. Army War College, Maj. Gen. William Stofft commanding, refuses to correct its infamous monograph that cast doubt on reports of the poison-gassing of the Kurds.)
The Kurdish view of Bosnia? "The West should act decisively to stop the war criminals," says Barzani, whose people were saved by the West from a war criminal. "And why don't the Arabs help? Not just because the people being killed are Muslims, but because they are human beings." He shakes his head. "If we had the force, we would use it against the Serbs."

HEADLINE: Why Has New York City Just Recognized Small Businesses?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I found your May 3 report that New York City is looking to small businesses to provide jobs right on target. Though the Department of Business Services classifies 98 percent of all companies in New York as small shops, the city has fewer small businesses than in 1969. 
 In the 1980's, small businesses accounted for 75 percent of job growth nationwide; in this city, however, that figure was only 22 percent. Even more troublesome, small businesses grew by 4 percent in New York City in the 80's, compared with 24 percent across the country.
The vast majority of burdensome laws, regulations, taxes and conditions under which small-business owners operate these days explains why so many companies have flocked out of the metropolitan area.
That the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins is only now attempting to exploit New York City's potential as an incubator of new businesses and small businesses speaks volumes about government's misguided priorities.

HEADLINE: Why Has New York City Just Recognized Small Businesses?;
A Role in Exports

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is to be hoped that those responsible for the new initiatives to alleviate small-business burdens in New York City (news article, May 3) will integrate their efforts with the New York State export finance program, formed just over a year ago by the State's Department of Economic Development and the private New York Business Development Corporation. 
 According to the Department of Commerce, New York State exports in 1992 were valued at $22.6 billion, supporting some 429,000 full-time job equivalents. The Bureau of Census reports that in many fields, small businesses export more per employee than larger companies. Small-business growth can reduce unemployment and increase tax revenues.
Export finance is essential if small businesses are to expand sales overseas, where payment is usually received weeks, even months, after shipment. The New York export finance program can help smaller companies get financing before and after shipment, without which exporters cannot compete in world markets.
Exporters abroad are supported by government financing. The United States company that limits its sales to the domestic market may soon find that market also lost to foreign competition.

HEADLINE: Trenton Names Auditor to Rule Newark Schools

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 13

 BODY:
The State Education Commissioner moved today to take fiscal control of the troubled Newark school system by appointing a special auditor to oversee its business and financial operations, with veto power over school board spending greater than $20,000.
The announcement by the Commissioner, Dr. Mary Lee Fitzgerald, came as she released a detailed report that she says documents chronic failings in the school system, a system that spends more per pupil than most poor urban areas in New Jersey and even many affluent suburban districts. 
 Newark's critics have said the system does not make good use of the money it has, but district officials say education spending alone cannot solve the problems of troubled urban children. Saying she was acting because of the report's conclusions, Dr. Fitzgerald ordered a review that could lead to a state takeover of the Newark system within the next year.
Even as Newark school officials charged at their own news briefing that the timing of today's actions was politically motivated, Superintendent Eugene C. Campbell said the district would cooperate fully with the auditor general, and he said the system welcomed state advice or assistance.
In announcing her decision, Dr. Fitzgerald received the personal support of Gov. Jim Florio, who attended the Commissioner's news conference at the Department of Education.
The Governor was clearly signaling that the state was serious about watching how the Newark schools use the $354 million in aid that pours in from Trenton each year. The appointment of the auditor today suggested that the state did not want to wait for another report before beginning to address long-term problems of substandard student achievement, high truancy, poor maintenance and spending on administrative and support staff that has turned the system into what some officials have described as a patronage mill.
 
'A Jobs Market'
 Dr. Elena Scambio, an assistant education commissioner who served as the first state-appointed superintendent in the Jersey City takeover, said a member of the external review panel put it best: "Newark is a jobs market disguised as a school system."
Amid local school officials' accusations that the government was grandstanding in a gubernatorial election year, Mr. Campbell offered a token of the district's good faith, sketching the broad outline of a plan to improve security and building maintenance, raise academic performance and provide more after-school programs. But he reiterated Newark school officials' complaint: that there is never enough money or help to deal with the problems of poor urban children. Including Federal, state and local money, the district's annual budget is $535 million.
Mayor Sharpe James, who has long opposed the nine-member elected Board of Education, called today for a coalition of groups to take corrective action. He urged members of his administration, the City Council, the school board, clergy and other community leaders to end fiscal abuse and political interference. He has refused to say explicitly whether he would accept a state takeover, asserting instead that he favors any proposal that can improve the schools.
 
3-Month Survey
 The conclusions of the report released today, a three-month-long survey of the system by a committee of 50 outside experts in education, business and management, also formed the basis for Dr. Fitzgerald's decision to order one final management review, which could serve as the blueprint for a takeover.
The review, called a comprehensive compliance investigation, will seek to determine the causes of problems identified in the report.
As part of the review process, Dr. Fitzgerald named Rebecca A. Doggett, director of the Office of Business and Job Opportunity for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, to serve as auditor general. Such an office has existed since 1975, but today Dr. Fitzgerald said she would widen its scope and strength.
She also appointed Dr. Joseph Cappello, business administrator of the Clifton, N.J., school district, as assistant auditor general. Three other auditors will join their staff within the week, all working out of board headquarters in Newark.
Eventually, 12 officials from the Department of Education will form an evaluation team, and the state will seeks bids from professional consultants and auditing firms to conduct an independent management review of the system.
 
2 Previous Takeovers
 Should the state eventually intervene, it would dismiss the district's top administrators, including the superintendent and the elected nine-member school board, and replace them with state appointees for at least five years.
A state takeover of the Newark district -- with 50,000 students, the state's largest -- would be the third in New Jersey since legislation authorizing takeovers was adopted in 1988. The state's second- and third-largest districts, Jersey City and Paterson, were taken over in 1989 and 1991, respectively.
Since then budget constraints delayed Trenton's efforts to focus on the state's largest district.
But last fall the state reviewed a 1987 report evaluating how Newark had addressed problems identified in a 1984 assessment. An updated report from a review panel appointed last December reached the Commissioner in mid-April.
The report released today documents failings in finance, management, buildings and educational programs in an urban district whose problems, the report said, are similar to those of every large urban school district: declining population, declining job base, an exodus of middle- and high-income residents and a rise in family and child poverty.
 
Panel Finds Link
 As a result the school district has become one of the few repositories for jobs and power in Newark. William H. Tremayne, senior vice president of the Prudential Insurance Company and co-chairman of the external review panel, said the committee repeatedly identified a strength-sapping link between jobs, money and education.
There was often more money available for those who were failing, he said, than those who were achieving. The reason, Mr. Tremayne said, was that more Government funds are customarily available for remedial programs, and more funds mean more jobs. As a result, he said, "overall aspiration levels were based too low."
"Too many programs seem to have been created and expanded to chase monies available from other levels of government," the report said, "without thought as to whether it is in the best interest of the children. Therefore, we seen an overemphasis on running basic skills programs, rather than on getting children successfully out of them."
The report identified 225 areas in need of improvement, Mr. Tremayne said. The panel found numerous bookkeeping inefficiencies that led to late financial reports and poor inventory accounting. It found that no interest was received on payroll or construction accounts, that no written cash-flow or cash-management plan exists and that no investment reports are given to the board.
In one instance, the report found that $536,000 is budgeted as the annual contribution to the unemployment trust fund but that the fund does not need the money because contributions and interest far exceed claims.
The panel's subcommittee on buildings found that 92 percent of the schools had ceilings, walls or floors with holes, sags, damage or other hazards. And while maintenance projects are enormously costly, particularly since 70 percent of the buildings were built before 1950 (30 percent before 1890), tens of millions of dollars already budgeted and on hand have never been spent.
The panel also took issue with hiring practices. The study pointed out that Hispanic residents, who account for 26 percent of the system's enrollment, are not similarly represented among the system's employees.

HEADLINE: Power Built on Poverty: One Man's Odyssey

SERIES: The Baron Of the Bronx: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZwith MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
Through a network of nonprofit organizations, Ramon S. Velez has long dominated the antipoverty programs of the most downtrodden part of the South Bronx, America's symbol of urban poverty and powerlessness.
In no small part because of his social-service work, he is also a millionaire. 
 Mr. Velez holds no public office; aside from a few years on the City Council, he has been a notably unsuccessful candidate. But for a quarter-century, he has reigned as the political baron of the South Bronx. He has practically written the book on how to seize power and use it in an impoverished neighborhood, how to pull the interlocking levers of social services, politics and personal gain.
 
Interlocking Relationships
 Mr. Velez's nonprofit empire, for instance, operates an alcoholism clinic and a health center. Yet his personal ventures include a one-man consulting firm that landed a $150,000 contract to promote Puerto Rican rum, and a development company that leases space to the health center for a rent that Federal officials have called excessive.
And as scores of photos and warm letters that cover his office wall attest, he has put his political clout behind an eclectic gallery of candidates -- from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan to Jesse Jackson, from John V. Lindsay to Abraham D. Beame to Edward I. Koch.
Mr. Velez's interlocking business relationships and political pirouettes, glued together by a network of allies and relatives that amounts to a patronage system, have made him a perennial target of investigations, not to mention questions about whether his self-interest supersedes his commitment to the poor. In several cases over the years, government reports and audits have faulted programs run by him or his allies for inferior service, high costs or not serving enough people. As a result, several programs had funds cut off.
Mr. Velez considers it a point of pride that, despite what he estimates have been a hundred investigations of his finances and programs, none has led to indictments. Indeed, he has managed to accomplish a feat that has eluded almost all of his cohorts in the battle for antipoverty money and community power: at the age of 60, with controversy flaring at every side, he has survived and prospered.
 
Political Cunning and Muscle
 How Mr. Velez has accomplished this, to the point where next month he will proudly stride down Fifth Avenue before a million and a half people at the head of the Puerto Rican Day Parade, is a story of political cunning and muscle -- and, some contend, bare-knuckle bullying. It is a testament to how well he understood the potential for turning his community organizations, originally financed as 60's antipoverty pilot programs, into a political and economic force.
Time and again, his ability to switch political allegiances has resulted in continued contracts and funds for his antipoverty programs. In turn, he has used those programs as a source of campaign workers and as conduits for lucrative consulting and business contracts with companies he and his allies own. On Election Day, his machine can turn out a few thousand votes for the right candidate.
Today, Mr. Velez points to an operation that, through himself, his family and his close associates, provides social services to thousands of people daily.
"Look to the 70's and those who got millions," he said recently, crossing his wrists in the manner of a prisoner in handcuffs. "A lot are in jail or dead; the only one who is here is me.
"The others disappeared because they didn't plan. They saw it as something transitory, not permanent. I saw it as something permanent and effective for people in human services and politics."
 
A Penchant for Profit
Private Enterprise Mixes With Public
But while Mr. Velez says this reflects his persistence, organizing, and commitment to the poor, others see something else.
They point to such things as Mr. Velez's personal wealth. According to a financial statement prepared in 1988, he owned more than a dozen properties, including numerous condominiums in San Juan's upscale Condado district, another parcel in Puerto Rico where he planned to build luxury housing, and farmland in upstate New York. He had also amassed more than $1 million in pensions and annuities and claimed an annual gross income of $290,897, much of it from his private businesses that had dealings with related nonprofit groups.
"Maybe he doesn't break the law, maybe he bends it," said the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, whose relations with Mr. Velez have often been stormy. "Maybe it's flexible in his hands."
The Velez empire extends in many directions:
*Mr. Velez's flagship nonprofit corporation, the Hunts Point Multi-Service Center, Inc., spawned a series of organizations and programs that by his estimate have attracted $300 million in government funds over a quarter-century for programs involving health care, housing, drug treatment, day care, and services for the elderly. Today, the center has an annual budget of nearly $11 million and employs 250 people.
*The nonprofit South Bronx Community Management Corporation, which Mr. Velez once headed and which is now run by his son, Ramon Jr., manages 56 government-subsidized apartment buildings with 135 employees and an annual budget of $14 million, according to its director of housing. A subsidiary owns a profit-making company that provides data processing for the Hunts Point center and is run by a long-time Velez associate.
*Mr. Velez is also chairman of two manufacturing companies operated by a subsidiary of a nonprofit spinoff group, including one that pleaded guilty to bid-rigging and was barred from Federal work for three years. Mr. Velez said he had no knowledge of the illegal activity before it was uncovered by a Federal investigation.
*Close friends and allies of Mr. Velez hold key positions on the community advisory board of Lincoln Hospital and in a nonprofit home-care program with 400 employees. At times Mr. Velez has also wielded his influence over several other community boards and organizations, including the troubled boards of Community School Districts 7 and 12.
*Mr. Velez heads a development company and a consulting firm that together have received more than $1 million in contracts from nonprofit groups with which he has connections.
Conflict-of-interest rules vary from agency to agency, contract to contract, but at a minimum they require the disclosure of Mr. Velez's interests in enterprises that do business with his nonprofit agencies. In recent months, the City Comptroller and the State Health Department have each held up funds for the Hunts Point Multi-Service Center while they untangle Mr. Velez's web of business interests and see how they relate to the nonprofit corporation.
The Health Department intends to question him about his failure to disclose that he serves as president of the company that owns the building that houses the Hunts Point health clinic, said Peter Slocum, a department spokesman.
The Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, has objected to the renewal of any contracts with the Hunts Point center because, in 1991, Mr. Velez failed to disclose his involvement with four businesses, including one with the subsidiary that pleaded guilty to bid-rigging on Federal contracts. Mr. Velez says his lack of disclosure was, at most, an oversight and was not required anyway.
 
Adequate, Not Outstanding
 Beyond this, according to former Representative Herman Badillo, perhaps Mr. Velez's most persistent critic, is the sense that the programs provided by his social-service empire are adequate, but little more.
"The legacy has not been good," he said. "Look at evaluations over a 30-year period and you will find no outstanding pilot programs having been developed, no outstanding people coming out of this.
"The Hunts Point Multi-Service Center is there, but it's not outstanding. It doesn't have top people there. It's a mediocre thing."
 
Growth of an Organizer
From Farm Boy To Social Worker
Mr. Velez, an ample, agile-minded man, grew up the son of a farmer in the small Puerto Rican town of Hormigueros, outside Mayaguez. He came to the Bronx at 28. After a stint as a social worker, during which he says he was overwhelmed by the social ills and political powerlessness of his countrymen, he used his skills as an organizer to take control of chunks of Great Society money for groups he controlled.
Battles over these funds sometimes spilled into the street. In August 1969, a brawl over the division of $3 million in antipoverty funds ended with a car running down Edwin Rivera, a man identified by the police as an opponent of Mr. Velez. Three Velez allies were arrested on charges of murder, but the charges were dropped.
Bad feelings over the incident still linger in the Bronx, and over the years there have been repeated allegations of violence associated with Mr. Velez's operations. Veterans of Mr. Badillo's successful Congressional campaigns against Mr. Velez in the 1970's charge that some Velez campaign workers shot at them and vandalized their offices. Last year, the head of a Bronx group that distributes antipoverty money claimed Mr. Velez had put him in a headlock when the group voted to stop financing an organization run by Mr. Velez's ex-wife, whom Mr. Velez says he is planning to remarry.
In fact, the only crime he was ever charged with was assaulting a Village Voice reporter in Puerto Rico; he was acquitted.
 
Stories Spread by Opponents
 Mr. Velez says stories of violence were spread by political opponents or that, as in the case of the confrontation over funds to his wife's organization, his actions were in part provoked by personal attacks on close family members.
"I'm always for compromise," he said. "I gain nothing by fighting."
Even Mr. Velez's foes acknowledge that he has always been able to marshal cadres of campaign workers from the staffs of his agencies, and to turn out votes from the recipients of those agencies' social services.
"He ultimately has to take responsibility for getting the majority of our existing Latino elected officials into office in the Bronx," said Marlene Cintron, who heads Mayor David N. Dinkins' Office of Latino Affairs. "He did that with his machine and all of the housing projects that he developed through the years."
Early support came from Republicans like Mr. Lindsay and Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. But when Mr. Beame was elected on the shoulders of the Democratic machine, Mr. Velez became a cog in the Bronx organization and an influential ally of the former boss, Stanley Friedman. Contracts flowed.
 
Delivering for Establishment
 To John Mollenkopf, a political science professor at the City University Graduate Center and the author of a recent book on the mayoralty of Edward I. Koch, the key to Mr. Velez's success was an understanding of how antipoverty politics would play in New York.
"Instead of the leader of the antipoverty organization representingconstituents to people higher up in the political establishment," he said, "he became an agent for control of his clients on behalf of people higher up in the establishment."
Although Government funds for Mr. Velez's programs were frequently halted early in the tenure of Mr. Koch, who had assailed Mr. Velez as a "poverty pimp," they resumed within a few years.
In a recent interview, Mr. Koch said he had valued Mr. Velez's political support. "I'd rather have him on my side than against me," he said. "He's out in the street, and he campaigns."
Beyond this, he added, "I like him." He said he had reversed his earlier opinion because, "I always heard that he was dishonest, but every time the story was checked, it turned out that he was honest."
Calling back later, Mr. Koch added, "He is not a paragon. He wouldn't tell you that he is. I am not swearing for his integrity, but I know of nothing that reflects adversely."
 
Poor Management Charged
 Over the years, though, many of Mr. Velez's groups have been investigated and lost funds or government contracts because of poor management, questionable finances and the awarding of no-bid contracts. Mr. Velez himself was barred from participating in the Puerto Rican Day Parade for a decade after the State Attorney General's office questioned its financial practices. Mr. Velez was permitted to return to the parade after claims against him were dismissed in a later suit.
None of this was more than a rock diverting the stream of government money. To Mr. Velez and his supporters, that is evidence that the charges were the work of political opponents. To Edward Logue, the urban planner named by Mr. Koch to run a rebuilding effort in the South Bronx in the 70's, they indicated something else.
"I thought the empire never got the scrutiny it deserved," said Mr. Logue. "Nobody ever monitored it."
Susan E. Shepard, the city's Investigation Commissioner, said that the monitoring of agencies like Mr. Velez's is a growing problem, as nonprofit groups take on a greater social-service role. Last year, the city awarded 4,000 contracts worth $2.8 billion to community groups.
And since they are not subject to many of the background checks and ethics provisions that apply to government agencies, she said, "there are thousands of employees administering public funds without some of the safeguards we rely on."
 
Profit From Poverty
 The elaborate web of public and private enterprises is the underpinning of the Velez empire.
Between 1987 and 1990, according to Paul Bleifer, Mr. Velez's lawyer, Ravel Associates, a one-man consulting firm owned by Mr. Velez, received $900,000 in fees from South Bronx Community Management, now run by Ramon Velez Jr.
When asked what services he performed in 1988 when he was paid $235,000 -- and when his son and ex-wife were paid $123,601 as corporate officers -- Mr. Velez could not recall.
"Whatever it was, it was a good investment," he said.
He also serves as president of the Don Pancho Development Corporation, which owns the cramped four-story building that houses the Hunts Point Multi-Service Health Clinic. Hunts Point pays Don Pancho $99,000 a year in rent, a figure the Federal Government criticized as excessive. Mr. Bleifer, who is also the attorney for Hunts Point and Don Pancho, said the rent had been negotiated by the city and has not been raised since Don Pancho purchased the building in 1987.
Don Pancho also has the maintenance contract for South Bronx Community Management's largest development, the 340-unit O.U.B. Houses, Mr. Velez said.
 
Accusations of Self-Dealing
 The accusations of self-dealing within the Velez empire concern contracts large and small. In 1990, Mr. Velez's brother Paco, whom he had installed as head of the Ruth Fernandez Family Shelter, was dismissed after the city's Department of Investigation found that the shelter had improperly bought 10 mattresses manufactured by Paco Velez's private company, Mattresses Paco.
That same year, a major data-processing contract led to a conflict between public and profit-making interests. Bronx Computing Systems and Service, a profit-making subsidiary of South Bronx Community Management that is operated by an old Velez ally, handles data processing for the management company and Hunts Point; they are its only clients.
When it learned that Bronx Computing had been hired without competitive bidding by the Hunts Point methadone program, the State Division of Substance Abuse Services demanded that the group solicit other vendors or risk losing about $100,000 in support. The state already had been faulting the company for high costs and poor service.
Another company then submitted a bid that could have saved Hunts Point about $200,000 over 10 years, according to the Division of Substance Abuse Services. But Hunts Point stuck with Bronx Computing, walking away from the state money.
Mr. Velez said that he had wanted to keep jobs in the South Bronx, and that the other vendor would have saddled the methadone clinic with obsolete equipment.
But the state agency saw it differently. "When you run programs and try to pinch pennies and balance budgets, $100,000 is no small change," said Michael Melendez, a spokesman. "What they said to us is, 'We don't need your rules and regulations.' "
 
Stepping Back
'The Musclemen Are Getting Old'
These days, Mr. Velez says he sees himself removed from the political fray. "My time for politics is gone," he said.
Mr. Ferrer agrees, saying, "The musclemen are getting old, getting arthritis, heart attacks."
In the last year, such erstwhile adversaries as State Senator Pedro Espada and Councilwoman Lucy Cruz have begun to carve out niches in once-forbidden territory.
Even as much of the government money continues to flow, the Dinkins administration has been careful to keep its distance from Mr. Velez, at least publicly; top campaign officials say they have nothing to do with him. One senior administration official said that, these days, the political cost of a relationship with Mr. Velez outweighs the benefits of his clout.
Mr. Velez, however, has been counted out many times before. He says he expects to hear from the campaigns of all the mayoral candidates. Indeed, says Mr. Ferrer, what may be Mr. Velez's strongest suit politically these days is the lingering aura of power.
"If you perceive he has power, he's a powerful person," he said.
One recent afternoon, sitting back amid a lifetime's worth of political mementos, Mr. Velez gestured to a new addition -- an orange pennant from the Clinton-Gore inauguration.
Eyes flashing, he leaned forward and gave a thumbs-up sign.
Next: The rise and fall of a community health clinic.

HEADLINE: New Jump in Inflation Rattles Markets;
Consumer Prices Rose 0.4% in April In Broad Increase

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A spurt in consumer prices last month, coming right after a surge in producer prices, increased concerns that inflation may indeed be creeping back, even though economic growth remains modest.
The Consumer Prices Index jumped four-tenths of a percent in April, the Labor Department reported yesterday. That was twice as much as many forecasters had predicted. The rise was pervasive, reflecting price increases in most of the goods and services Americans use every day. 
 The increase lifted gold prices and led many forecasters to raise their inflation predictions. It also unsettled the bond and stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.32 points. [Page D6.]
The figures were widely viewed as dashing expectations that inflation this year would be lower than last year, as well as any lingering hopes that the Federal Reserve would push interest rates further down.
 
Above Expectations, Again
 What bothered many analysts was not just the April jump, but the fact that three of the last four reports on consumer prices were higher than expected. The index has been climbing at a 4.3 percent annual rate so far this year, well above last year's 2.9 percent increase; the measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices has been rising at an even faster 4.5 percent annual rate.
"The inflation rate has bottomed out." said Joel Popkin, president of Joel Popkin & Company in Washington. Mr. Popkin has said for several months that the Fed's expectation of further gains on the inflation front this year was overly optimistic and that inflation would be a bit higher this year than last.
That could complicate matters for the Clinton Administration, which has been counting on lower long-term interest rates to offset the drag higher taxes would have on the economy.
But Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, held out hope for relief in coming months. "I'm not dismayed," she said. "It's hard to accept two or three months as evidence of a fundamental change in the trend."
President Clinton hit much the same note. "There is no -- at the present time -- no cause for long-term concern," he said. "It could be just a blip."
The unsettling inflation report stole the limelight from several reassuring economic reports yesterday. Jobless claims ticked down a bit in the latest week, while consumers spent more freely in April, especially on cars, after staying away from stores in March. Auto producers also reported that sales were strong in the first 10 days of May.
The inflation report pushed up interest rates generally and seemed to leave the Fed with less maneuvering room to respond to the slow-growing economy.
"The C.P.I. report would certainly foreclose any Fed easing in the near future," said William Poole, a monetary economist at Brown University.
"It's a classic dilemma," he added. "If we pay attention to the soft economy, we'd say monetary policy should ease. If we look at the inflation numbers, we might say the Fed should tighten a little."
 
No Quick Shift Expected
 Still, several analysts said the next crop of inflation reports is likely to be a little less grim than those from this winter and spring, and they suggested that the Federal Reserve, whose monetary policy committee meets next Tuesday, would probably wait before shifting toward tighter money.
The Fed said as recently as February that it expected inflation for this year to come in well below 3 percent. Now some economists are raising their forecasts to about 3.5 percent.
"Inflation is a little above where the Fed would like, and growth is a little weaker than the Fed would like," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Securities. "All in all, the Fed is on hold."
One negative for economists was that April's price increases were so ubiquitous.
"One doesn't want to make too much out of one month's data," said Patrick C. Jackman of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "but the rise in the C.P.I. is not due to special factors, and it's pretty pervasive."
In six of the seven categories of goods and services that make up the Consumer Price Index, prices rose more in April than they increased in March. The only exception was a catch-all category that includes tobacco and education. A 3.5 percent rise in meat and vegetable prices was probably weather-related. A jump in hospital rates pushed up the price of medical care at an annual rate of more than a 7 percent. Car prices, which typically come down in the spring as dealers start discounting models, rose instead.
But most of the pick up in the inflation rate from March to April reflected higher housing costs -- both for renters and homeowners -- and firmer clothing prices, which had been falling.
 
Higher Prices, Modest Growth
 What could make inflation creep up in an economic expansion that has been sufficiently modest to keep the unemployment rate at 7 percent? Three things, economists say.
First, the economy's supply capacity may be smaller than thought. "There are signs that the long period of slow growth had an impact on supply," Mr. Popkin said, pointing to companies downsizing and shutting plants in four or five years of slow growth. "The effect is to reduce supply."
Second, productivity growth, which was stronger last year than in any year since 1972, will inevitably slow this year. That means that unit labor costs, a good indicator of basic inflation trends, are likely to rise a bit faster.
Finally, the Fed, while not overly easy, has supplied plenty of liquidity in recent quarters, judging by the rapid growth of bank reserves and currency in circulation, the relatively weak dollar and the large spread between short- and long-term interest rates.
The 1.2 percent rebound in retail sales in April suggested that consumers have not totally lost faith in the economic expansion and that a large part of the eight-tenths of a percent drop in sales in March did reflect the weather. Nonetheless, spending is still barely higher than December's level, and the outlook is for merely modest gains.
On the employment front, applications for unemployment insurance edged down by 3,000, to 339,000. But the four-week average still ticked up to 345,075.

HEADLINE: NATO Adrift? Allies Worry Over Bosnia Impasse

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 12

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's impasse with the European allies on military steps in the Balkans and subsequent indecision have left senior NATO officials feeling leaderless at a time when the alliance is struggling to find a new purpose.
Having failed to persuade the Europeans of the need to arm Bosnian Muslims and bomb Serbian targets, President Clinton has now discarded that option but given American officials no guidance on what to plan for instead, NATO and American officials say. 
 The United States and its allies appear to be heading toward a decision to do little about the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina other than to quarantine it by monitoring operations in an effort to keep the war from spreading.
Both European and United States officials acknowledge that this would be a major confession of failure, one that many of them ascribe to an absence of American leadership by two Administrations.
President Clinton's statement on Tuesday that he was considering sending American troops to Macedonia to aid peacekeeping forces there seemed to be an answer to European suggestions that if the United States wanted to lead the alliance into more effective action, it would have to become a player on the ground.
"It came as a surprise," said Fraser Cameron, a European Community official. "It is not an answer to what to do in Bosnia."
A senior NATO military official said that there was no overall strategy behind the suggestion, and that the President of Macedonia had recently told the alliance that he thought the 444 Scandinavian troops that were there now as observers were enough.
But the lack of an American military stake in the region has hampered the Clinton Administration's ability to get the allies who do have troops there -- France and Britain, principally -- to follow Washington's lead in dealing with the conflict. The result is a crisis that many NATO leaders fear could lead to permanent damage to the alliance's credibility, and to United States interests in Europe.
"We're in the woods," an American official at the alliance's headquarters here acknowledged. "I hope we'll get out soon."
This will not happen unless the United States leaves the allies in no doubt about how it sees its objectives in the Balkans, many diplomats believe.
That Europe itself has failed to address the crisis is something nobody here disputes.
"We are all looking to the United States to take the lead again," said Willem van Eekelen, secretary general of the Western European Union, a nine-nation military organization. "Our European credibility has fallen very low."
 
Did NATO Lose Opportunity?
 Morale is also low at NATO's military headquarters at Mons, south of Brussels, officers of the alliance say.
Searching for a new role now that the military threat from the former Soviet Union has largely collapsed, officers at the military headquarters say NATO may have missed its chance.
As many NATO officers see it, the Bosnian Serb forces have called their bluff. The failure of nerve is all the more galling to some because the alliance strategy adopted in Rome in November of 1991 said that with the Soviet threat gone, risks to allied security were more likely to arise from "the serious economic, social and political difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes, which are faced by many countries in Central and Eastern Europe."
When just such a crisis arose in Bosnia and Herzegovina, NATO showed itself to be ineffectual, many officers say. Some suggest that it would not have been if the United States had committed ground forces to United Nations missions in Croatia and Bosnia, as its European allies have already done.
 
U.S. Troops in Bosnia?
 Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator on Bosnia, has suggested that the United States should join its European allies in providing support on the ground, not just from the skies, for United Nations aid missions in Bosnia. And on Monday, European Community foreign ministers said they would welcome both American and Russian personnel in eventual international supervision of safe areas for civilian refugees and of the border between Bosnia and Serbia.
An American stake cannot be established if Washington is willing to become involved only by bombing Serbian artillery positions from the air, the European allies believe. If the United States committed troops to the United Nations relief and peacekeeping forces already in Bosnia and Croatia, officials here say, it might have much more leverage on its overseas partners.
With American troops on the ground, these Europeans believe, Washington would also be more sensitive to concerns that radical intervention like bombing could expose lightly armed peacekeeping forces to Serb retaliation and make them into hostages.
Even the French, who insist that any Western military intervention should be carried out under the authority and command of the United Nations rather than NATO, acknowledge that if the United States assumes a leading military role in the Balkans, it could do so only through the alliance.
"If the Americans want a large role on the ground in Yugoslavia, it will have to be done through NATO," an alliance official said. "The real divide is over what the course of action should be. Should the alliance take sides, by helping the Muslims roll back the Serbs with bombing, or should it come in only to help enforce a peace after the warring parties agree on one?"
A senior NATO official said that a military force sent in to enforce the peace agreement would probably require 70,000 troops.
At least 25,000 of them would have to come from the United States, alliance officials say, but none of the allies would be willing to make commitments until the United States took the lead.
Looking back at NATO's inability to take effective steps of its own so far, officials of four different countries agreed on the main reason for the failure. "There was no U.S. leadership," one said this week.

HEADLINE: Brazilian State Leads Way in Saving Children

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARACANAU, Brazil

 BODY:
In the dim, smoke-stained interior of a sharecropper's shack, 1-year-old Maria sat quietly on the dirt floor, her infant spark dulled by diarrhea and malnutrition.
With seven other children to care for, Maria's mother, Antonia Souza Lima, explained that she could not afford the time -- an hour-and-a-half walk -- or the 40-cent bus fare to take her listless baby to the nearest medical post. 
 Fading quietly, Maria seemed destined to become one of the 250,000 Brazilian children who die every year before turning 5.
But in a new effort to cut the devastating infant mortality rate here, a community health worker recently started to walk weekly to the Lima household, bringing oral rehydration formula for Maria and hygiene advice for her mother, who has a television setbut no water filter.
With the new public health program, involving a low-cost army of health workers, Ceara state is showing Brazil that even in times of economic austerity infant mortality can be cut.
In four years, Ceara, one of the poorest of Brazil's northeastern states, cut its infant mortality rate by nearly one-third. The number of babies who died before reaching their first birthday was 39 per 1,000 live births in 1990, the last year a survey was conducted, down from 57 per 1,000 in 1987.
Increasingly, Brazilians are discussing their child mortality record, one of the worst in the Americas, and health planners from other northeastern states are flocking to Ceara to study its program,
While Brazil has a $450 billion economy -- roughly the same size as those of Russia and China -- health workers point out that economic statistics do not always measure human welfare.
Brazil scores poorly on infant mortality, the number of babies who die before their first birthday. Although its $2,920 per capita income is eight times that of China, Brazil has an infant mortality rate two and a half times China's -- of every 1,000 live births, 55 Brazilian babies die before their first birthday.
"With the 'economic miracle,' middle-class infant mortality vanished, but it has not been dislodged from the shantytowns, from the rural northeast," said Nancy Scheper-Hughes, an anthropology professor at the University of California at Berkeley, referring to Brazil's explosive economic growth under the military Governments of the 1960's and 1970's.
While Brazil's ruling army generals prided themselves on building the world's biggest dam and the world's longest bridge, they never showed enthusiasm for programs that cut infant mortality, like education for women, day-care centers and the promotion of breast-feeding.
After civilian rule returned in 1985, Government mismanagement, corruption and heavy indebtedness undermined efforts to improve health conditions. Typically, a Government effort in 1991 to duplicate Ceara's health plan nationally was derailed when scandal forced the Health Minister to resign.
"The minister came here to look at our program," said Tasso Jereissati, who started the program as Ceara's Governor. "I said this has to be a simple as possible -- someone from the community, walking on foot with a little backpack."
 
Local Solutions Sought
 The program, called Viva Crianca, or Long Live the Child, was started in 1987 by Mr. Jereissati, a Social Democrat whose party in elections the year before turned out a group of conservative, landowning politicians. Declaring child survival a state priority, Mr. Jereissati drew up the program with the help of local doctors. The first community health agents were drawn from 6,000 people who were given temporary work in the 1987 drought.
Today, with the central Government largely paralyzed as 19 political parties jockey for power, more and more Brazilians look for local solutions.
Once a month, the 7,240 workers in the Ceara health program enter the homes of four million people, the poor majority of a state where most people's incomes are less than $1 a day.
In six years the locally financed program has lifted Ceara from near the bottom to near the top of Brazil's 26 states in child-protection indicators like vaccinations, child visits to pediatricians and duration of breast-feeding. To help the children of working mothers, the number of community-run day-care centers has soared, from 8 in 1987 to 257 today.
The program is intended to reverse the centralization of health resources found in much of the third world.
 
Costs 'Virtually Nothing'
 "Instead of having sick citizens clog hospitals, we opted for prevention and family visits," said Ciro Gomes, Ceara's 35-year-old Governor, who since taking office two years ago has extended the program to all 182 towns in the state. "The health agent program costs virtually nothing -- $500,000 a month."
In recognition of this achievement, Unicef is bestowing on "the people and the state of Ceara" the 1993 Unicef Maurice Pate Award, a prize that honors child-protection efforts. For the first time in the award's 27-year history the award is going to South America.
In a country where newspapers frequently report on people dying while waiting in lines at Government-run hospitals, the idea of decentralized, preventive medicine has increasing appeal. After 12 years of economic stagnation, many people argue that Brazil's children cannot afford to wait for the benefits of a hypothetical future growth to trickle down.
Viva Crianca stipulates that health agents be picked from the communities where they live. They earn Brazil's minimum wage -- currently $55 a month. The state recently started to distribute bicycles and baby scales to some agents.
"A bicycle would help," said Maria de Fatima Goncalves as she showed Mrs. Lima how to produce oral rehydration formula from salt, sugar and clean water. "Some of the houses are far away."
Dressed in a white T-shirt and denim shorts, Miss Goncalves carried the bare necessities in a small backpack: soap, scissors, an ointment for burns, a fine comb for lice and a medicine for scabies. The 22-year-old is responsible for visiting each month 82 rural families who live within a four-mile radius of her house.
To many in Ceara, where Viva Crianca is enormously popular, the home visits and referrals are the greatest value. "I tell the agents they are my eyes and ears," said Pedro Correia, a hospital surgeon in Morada Nova, a town 150 miles south of here.
And for the peasants in Brazil's outback, the arrival of health care workers is a welcome novelty. Erismar Rodrigues de Lima, a neighbor of the Limas, listened intently to instructions on filtering drinking water.
"I am the first member of my family to ever receive prenatal care," said the 22-year-old woman, who is expecting a baby in June.

HEADLINE: French Disavow Accord On Farm-Trade Subsidy

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 13

 BODY:
The new center-right French Cabinet unveiled a tough trade policy today, rejecting a trans-Atlantic agreement on farm subsidies reached in November, rebuking the United States for reprisals, and arguing that liberalism in world trade is not sufficient in itself at a time when many European jobs are threatened.
The five-page statement, released by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, amounted to a call for a review of European trade policy as far-reaching as that being undertaken by the Clinton Administration. 
 With a backdrop of recession in Europe and unemployment exceeding 10 percent in the 12-nation European Community, the French leadership said that an opening of markets through lower tariffs must be carried out in a way that avoided "devastating effects on employment." Growing competition from industries using cheap labor in the former East bloc is causing increasing uneasiness among politicians and wage earners in Western Europe.
On the eve of trade talks by the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Community in Toronto on Friday, France's policy statement suggested that a long-sought world trade agreement, widely viewed as essential to revive many sagging economies, was still a long way off.
 
Gently Stated Warning
 Referring to the stalled negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which began in Uruguay in 1986, Mr. Balladur said, "If people want to go too fast and force our hand, I am sorry to say that they are likely to be disappointed."
The statement appeared to be addressed principally to the Clinton Administration. It defended some European subsidies, and revived a French belief that the cultural heritage of Europe needed to be defended -- in this case against an onslaught of American television programs. European Community television channels, it said, should show "a majority share of European programming."
On the matter of trade subsidies, France said that any accord negotiated in GATT talks should recognize that "general rules are not applicable to sectors, such as agriculture and aerospace, for which specific arrangements have been defined."
While the statement was presented as constructively conceived to overcome the long trade-talk impasse, it was uncompromising on almost all issues. In part, analysts said, this might reflect a tough initial stance that could be softened in negotiations.
 
Basis of U.S. Arguments
 European trade policies, and particularly European subsidies, have been the focus of persistent criticism by the Clinton Administration, which has said that the subsidies distort global trade and take a toll in American jobs by causing companies like Boeing to lose market share.
Among the policies that have been assailed in Washington are those on aerospace, agriculture, steel, intellectual property and procurement for public projects. Only on the procurement issue has a partial accord been reached.
"Commercial rows between the community and the United States have multiplied in recent months," the French statement acknowledged. "The Uruguay trade round cannot be concluded unless these differences are first resolved and the conditions for lasting trade peace accepted."
On agriculture, Mr. Balladur gave no hint of concessions. He dismissed the November accord on farm trade reached between the United States and the Europeans as "unacceptable in its present state." This accord had been seen as an important step toward a broad world trade pact.
In particular, France rejected a clause saying that European Community grain exports should be cut 21 percent over the next six years. It suggested that Europe required additional protection against some American farm products.
 
Anger Abroad Is Expected
 United States officials are likely to be annoyed by these French policy positions, particularly because the community's delegates were supposed to have been negotiating on behalf of all members when they signed the farm accord last year. Other community nations, eager to push forward toward a GATT agreement, are likely to be irritated, too.
Still, an American trade official who insisted on anonymity said in Washington today that the Administration had received no official notification from French officials of any change in policy. The official noted that the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, is scheduled to meet his French counterpart during a visit to Paris early next month.
Prime Minister Balladur's statement, however tough its content, tried to strike a conciliatory tone. It called for an "armistice" on all current disputes and an abandonment by Washington of "unilateral trade practices." This apparently referred to American trade legislation that allows formal steps to be taken against unfair competition.
In place of a cycle of threats, conflict and last-minute compromise that has increasingly characterized trans-Atlantic trade dealings, Mr. Balladur proposed the creation of a World Organization of Commerce to mediate and rule on trade conflicts.
 
Only an Allusion to Japan
 How this might function alongside GATT's existing structure was not clear, but France suggested that with world trade issues becoming increasingly complex, a group dedicated solely to enforcing trade agreements was needed.
The French statement, in contrast to its persistent references to the United States, did not directly refer to Japan. It did say:
"France wants third countries, particularly the most protected, to open their markets to European corporations. To achieve this, it is necessary to end the current confrontation between the community and the United States in order to restore a multilateral aspect to the trade negotiations, which is the only useful approach."

India Suggests Talks
 NEW DELHI, May 13 (Special to The New York Times) -- India said today that it was prepared to negotiate afresh to meet concerns of the United States over patent protection for American companies. Two weeks ago, India was placed on a list of nations for possible trade sanctions.
Salman Khurshid, a ranking official in the Indian Foreign Ministry, said, "We want the U.S. to understand that this is not something you can do in a hurry." He declared that India's listing under provisions of the legislation by Mr. Kantor's office threatened to "obstruct" and "interfere with the ace" of economic reform.

HEADLINE: China Trade: Cash or Care?;
Clinton Must Endorse Money, Rights or Both

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Seven months after the candidate Bill Clinton accused the Bush Administration of ignoring China's human rights abuses, President Clinton finds himself forced to decide if the United States should risk its access to China's booming economy for the sake of political freedom there.
On one side are those who say trade is a lever the President must use to force China to improve its record on human rights and abide by international rules on trade in weapons. On the other are business executives appalled at the prospect of losing a major market. 
 The Administration is conducting a comprehensive review of American policy toward China, aimed at producing a single strategy on trade, the spread of arms and human rights issues. But although the President has the authority to make the trade decision himself, Congress can overrule him, and at least one legislator has already promised to force a vote on the House floor unless the President refuses to renew the favorable trade status China now enjoys.
 
Import Duties Could Soar
 If this "most favored nation" status lapses, import duties on Chinese goods would rise, on average, to 40 percent from 8 percent.
Mr. Clinton could count himself among those who say trade is a powerful tool to force China to alter its policies. In the Presidential debate on Oct. 11, Mr. Clinton said China's "most favored nation" trade status should be linked to whether it chose to "recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty" in the pro-democracy Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989.
In an earlier speech he had gone even further, saying that China's access to the American market should be cut off unless democratic changes were made by the end of 1992.
Federal law now requires President Clinton to choose in the next three weeks whether to extend China's favorable trade status for another year. The decision is complicated by the overwhelming consensus in the American business community that China has become one of the world's most attractive export markets.
More than 300 American corporations and trade associations, ranging from General Motors to the Chamber of Commerce, urged President Clinton in a letter on Wednesday to extend the trade status with no strings attached. The result has been an extraordinary struggle pitting executives against former torture victims and prison camp survivors and persecuted Christians in a competition to win the attention of Congress and the Administration.
 
U.S. Presence Called Helpful
 "I think our presence there has helped the human rights situation considerably" said Jack J. Murphy, chairman and chief executive of Dresser Industries, a large producer of oil field equipment, who signed the letter.
But Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who has led Congressional critics of China's human rights record, said the business community's lobbying was aimed at the wrong country. "If they spent one-tenth of the energy and time lobbying the Chinese on human rights restrictions that they spend on lobbying Congress on this issue, then we would be past this issue by now," she said.
The President has also received intelligence reports that the Chinese are exporting missile and nuclear weapons technology. President Clinton told a group of three dozen corporate chairmen at a closed-door meeting in March that if the United States did not confront China now about these exports, another terrorist bomb under the World Trade Center a decade from now might be a nuclear weapon, according to three people attending the meeting.
White House officials declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of the meeting. Administration officials provided details of the intelligence reports to highly classified meetings today of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
 
Returned Empty-Handed
 China has been reluctant to make concessions. An American delegation that visited Beijing this week came away empty-handed, according to American officials.
But Chinese officials warn that restrictions on the trade status could harm relations, a prospect that appalls American executives hoping for Chinese Government contracts. And even Congressional critics of China have stopped short of discouraging American companies from business there.
At the same time, the Administration's human rights concerns persist. Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, took the unusual step a week ago of praising Levi Strauss & Company, the clothing manufacturer, for announcing that it would reduce its operations in China over human rights.
The most likely step now is for the Administration to renew the trade status with conditions on improvements in human rights and possibly with conditions on the spread of weapons, Administration and Congressional officials say. But no consensus has emerged from a series of interagency meetings this week, and the final decision will be President Clinton's, they said.
"You remember the old joke in the Bush Administration that the desk officer for China is the President?" asked Calman Cohen, a lobbyist. "Well, the desk officer is still the President."
The problem for the Administration is how to draft conditions that force Beijing to make changes, without being so tough that the Chinese Government dismisses them, yet appeasing China's critics in Congress.

Sales of U.S.-Produced Vehicles Up

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 13

 BODY:
Sales of domestically produced vehicles rose 30.2 percent in early May, the nation's auto makers said today, extending the strengthening automotive market into a fourth straight month.
Demand for light trucks, which include mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, showed particular strength, with a 44.4 percent sales gain in the period from May 1 to May 10, to 126,324, compared with 87,497 in the comparable period a year ago. 
 Sales of domestically produced cars were 157,496, up 20.8 percent from last year's 130,408. Vehicle sales over all totaled 283,820, compared with 217,905 last year. Vehicles made in Canada and Mexico, as well as in the United States, are considered domestic, regardless of where the manufacturer is based.
The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for car sales was 6.4 million for the period, down from 6.9 million in late April, but up from 5.7 million in the corresponding period last year.
 
Rise for '93 Forecast
 Harold A. Poling, the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said at the company's annual meeting today in Dearborn, Mich., that "although the U.S. economy has improved, the improvement has been slower and more modest than in previous recoveries." Ford is forecasting that the nation's vehicle sales will gain 5 percent in 1993, totaling about 13.7 million units.
Tom Webb, the chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said car sales "suffered a modest payback for their late April surge." But sales of sport utilities and mini-vans more than compensated, he said.
Some dealers, however, sounded mildly disappointed. "Early May was a little stagnant," said Mike Whitley, the manager of Roger Whitley Chevrolet in Tampa, Fla. "It's hard to figure why."
However, the General Motors Corporation's Chevrolet division, the backbone of the No. 1 auto maker, posted a remarkable increase over all. Chevy car sales rose 33.7 percent, to 28,869, and light-truck sales rose 51.9 percent, to 36,586.
G.M.'s car sales over all rose 12.9 percent, to 71,015, and light-truck sales rose 50.7 percent, to 48,251. Ford's car sales rose 19.1 percent, to 46,840; the company's light-truck sales rose 32.7 percent, to 41,629.
Ward's Automotive Reports estimated that car sales at the Chrysler Corporation rose 61.9 percent, to 18,700, while light-truck sales rose 46 percent, to 32,050. Chrysler posts its sales only monthly.
The Honda Motor Company sold 7,403 domestically produced cars, down 10.9 percent from 8,310 a year ago. The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 7,130 cars, up 38.2 percent from a year ago; Toyota also sold 1,621 domestically produced light trucks, a threefold increase from last year. The Nissan Motor Company sold 3,030 cars, up almost threefold from a year ago; Nissan's light-truck sales were 2,386, almost double last year's total.
The Big Three, which have been improving their share of the overall automotive market, saw a slight decline in their share of domestically produced vehicles sold. Big Three sales accounted for 90.8 percent of domestic production, compared with 91.1 percent in early May of last year.

HEADLINE: Citing Loan, Dinkins Bars Bond Firm

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins dismissed Fleet Securities yesterday as an official underwriter of city bonds, saying that a loan from the firm's sister bank to the Senate campaign committee of Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman last year had created an "appearance of a conflict" that could threaten the city's reputation in the credit markets.
In a letter to Ms. Holtzman, Mr. Dinkins wrote: "I know we both agree that as public servants, we have a fundamental obligation to avoid not only conflicts but the appearance of conflicts. In this case, the appearance of a conflict in the elevation of Fleet Securities could post a threat to that reputation. In the final analysis, I believe we must avoid jeopardizing the public's confidence in our selection process." 
 Last week, the City Department of Investigation began an inquiry into whether Fleet Securities had been given favorable treatment by Ms. Holtzman's office because of a $255,000 debt that Ms. Holtzman's Senate campaign owed to Fleet Bank during the selection. Both the securities firm and the bank are part of Fleet Financial Group, based in Providence, R.I.
 
Appearance Called the Only Reason
 The loan was made to the campaign in August, and seven months later Ms. Holtzman's office recommended Fleet Securities as an underwriter. Ms. Holtzman has always said that she knew nothing of her office's recommendation, and that her deputy, Darcy Bradbury, made the recommendation without consulting her. Ms. Bradbury has said she knew nothing of the loan.
Mr. Dinkins, in his letter, made it clear that the sole reason he was dismissing Fleet was the appearance of conflict of interest. He said the banking company was competent and qualified to underwrite city bonds. And he said the city should not disqualify the company because of an unsettled class-action lawsuit alleging that another Fleet subsidiary engaged in discriminatory lending practices against blacks in Georgia.
Ms. Holtzman, in a news release, maintained that Mr. Dinkins's letter corroborated her contention that there had been no conflict of interest.
"I welcome the Mayor's decision," she said in the statement. "It vindicates our position that Fleet Securities was promoted on the merits and it corroborates the absence of a conflict of interest in the selection of Fleet."
On Friday, Mr. Dinkins temporarily suspended Fleet Securities from the 30-member syndicate of companies that underwrite the city's $3 billion-a-year municipal bond sales, to allow his Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Barry F. Sullivan, to review Fleet's qualifications.
At the same time, as the Investigation Department began scrutinizing the loan, Ms. Holtzman recused herself from future decisions involving Fleet and asked the Mayor to re-evaluate the decision. She said she had erred by not knowing that her office was recommending Fleet while her campaign was renegotiating a repayment schedule for a campaign debt to the company's sister bank.
Thomas Lavelle, the spokesman for Fleet Financial Group, said yesterday that the company was disappointed to lose its status as a manager of part of the city's bond business, though he added that it was pleased the Mayor had recognized that the company was well qualified. "We understand the city's concern with appearance and accept their decision as such," he said.
Fleet Securities will still be allowed to sell city bonds as part of a large pool of about 150 companies that buy a small number of bonds from the syndicate of official city underwriters. But it will not be one of the 30 designated underwriters who are assured a greater part of the city's business.
In New York City, the Mayor and the Comptroller jointly decide on a list of about seven large underwriters who will be chosen as "managers" to oversee the city's borrowing. Then they draw up a list of 30 "co-managers," who are assured a share of the underwriting business. Fleet was selected as a co-manager after years of being in the selling pool.
Mr. Sullivan said the decision to remove Fleet was fundamentally a business decision and that city investigators were still working to determine whether Ms. Holtzman had violated conflict of interest provisions in the city charter.
"We said there was an appearance of favor, and that our underwriting decision process requires public confidence, a belief that we handle the process fairly, equitably, and this called that into question," he said. "Because of that, we said we believe that Fleet should not then be promoted from a syndicate member to co-manager."
Mr. Dinkins said he initially moved only to suspend Fleet because did not want to take final action before Mr. Sullivan and the City Finance Director, Michael W. Geffrard, had a chance to meet with bank executives and hear their side of the story, Mayoral aides said. On Monday, Mr. Geffrard met with several Fleet executives in the city's offices to discuss the loan and the bank's lending practices in Georgia.
In August, Ms. Holtzman's campaign, which was short of cash and lagging in polls, borrowed $450,000 from Fleet Bank at an interest rate of 7 percent to pay for an advertising campaign. Ms. Holtzman was the sole guarantor of the loan, which was secured only with a pledge of future donations that never materialized.
Mr. Geffrard said that the Fleet officials said at the meeting that while they made few campaign loans, they had charged a justifiable interest rate for the Holtzman debt. Financing experts have said that such a low interest rate to a political campaign would usually require collateral like real estate or other securities.
By March, when Fleet Securities was chosen, Ms. Holtzman's campaign had missed two deadlines for repaying the debt and still owed the bank $255,000, according to campaign officials and election records. Joseph McDonald, a lawyer for the campaign, said Ms. Holtzman had attended at least two meetings with Fleet Bank officials to renegotiate a payment schedule, one in early March and one in early April.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS: New Jump in Inflation Rattles Markets;
Treasury Prices Plunge as the Fed Faces a Decision

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The surprisingly sharp rise in the Consumer Price Index yesterday jolted the bond market, sending Treasury prices down sharply and the yield on the 30-year bond to its highest level in more than a month. But the rise probably is more troublesome for the Federal Reserve.
The nation's central bank has to decide much sooner than expected between two courses: whether to raise short-term interest rates to signal its resolve against inflation or to blink at the higher prices and keep interest rates where they are to assure that the economy is moving ahead at a moderate but steady pace.
 
 
Results of Decision
 A Fed-led rise in short-term interest rates could slow the economy while reassuring traders and investors that the central bank was opposed to any signs of resurgent inflation. The combination of expected slow growth and a tough Fed could bring longer-term rates lower. But a Fed that does nothing while inflation appears to be moving higher would push long-term interest rates higher. 
 Whatever the answer, the speculation about what the Federal Reserve might do could jostle the bond market for some time, adding to its volatility and making it difficult for yields to break out of their current trading range.
Yesterday, the report of the four-tenths of 1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for April knocked the price of the 30-year bond down almost one and a quarter points and caused the yield to jump to 6.95 percent. In the last two days, the impact of the equally surprising producer price increase Wednesday and the consumer price report has lifted the yield on the 30-year bond from 6.81 percent as the price dropped more than one and three-quarter points.
The consumer price report also seemed to end any talk for now about the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy, a theme that had been bandied about recently.
The Federal Reserve will have to address the issue next Tuesday, when its Federal Open Market Committee meets in one of its regular sessions to steer the course of monetary policy.
In February, when it presented its annual report to Congress, the Federal Reserve predicted that the Consumer Price Index would rise between 2.5 percent and 2.75 percent this year, below the 2.9 percent increase of last year.
With the four-tenths of a percent increase reported yesterday, that prediction will be difficult to reach. It would take an average monthly increase of two-tenths of a percent for the rest of the year to keep inflation at 3 percent. Anything larger and the rate is higher.
"Obviously it's higher than any one of us would have liked to have seen," a Fed governor, Susan M. Phillips, said in a telephone interview. "It will take much stronger reports for the rest of the year to get back in the area we would like," she added, using the word "stronger" to describe lower inflation. But she would not say that the goal was impossible to meet or comment on what impact the data would have on the Fed.
David Jones, the chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, said the inflation data might be even a more serious blow to the Fed because the members, including the chairman, Alan Greenspan, have been talking about getting inflation down to near zero.
 
 
Short-Term Rates
 Mr. Jones said that all this meant that the Fed would shift to a bias toward raising short-term interest rates by midyear and would actually start pushing them higher in the fall.
"I do not think the Fed wants to be perceived as waiting too long or as caving in," Mr. Jones said, recalling the striking picture on television and in print of Mr. Greenspan sitting next to the First Lady when President Clinton announced his economic plan to a joint meeting of Congress.
Lawrence A. Kudlow, the chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, agreed. "The Fed is going to snug up soon," he said, adding that the inflation numbers would prompt a big shift in expectations.
But Alan Lerner, the head of global markets-economics at Bankers Trust, disagreed. He said that while he expected inflation to move a little higher this year -- about 3.5 percent -- "it is much too early to get excited by that." He argued that the important number for the Fed is the sluggish 1.8 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter and the fact that raising interest rates would slow growth. "The Fed has to look at the economy and the extraordinary weak monetary aggregates," he said. "The Fed will not be doing anything for as long as the eye can see and for me that is usually about six months."
 
Treasury Market
 In the Treasury market, the sharp selloff in the morning seemed to help the auction of $8.26 billion of 30-year bonds because the cheaper price was more attractive for dealers. The price slump after the release of the six-tenths of a percent increase in the Producer Price Index for finished goods Wednesday gave the same lift to the 10-year note auction.
The 30-year bond, which is a new supply of the existing 7.125 percent bond first auctioned in February and due in 2023, was auctioned at an average rate of 6.97 percent. Despite all the negative inflation news, that was still the lowest auction average since the Treasury began to auction 30-year bonds regularly in 1977.
In the when-issued market, after the Treasury auction, the price of the 30-year bond rebounded a little as the yield in late trading was down to 6.95 percent. And with the quarterly auction finished, there might be some room for a small rebound in prices.
Following are the results of the 30-year bond auction yesterday:

G.M. Warns Of Pension Financing

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 13

 BODY:
If interest rates stay low through Oct. 1, the unfunded pension liability of the General Motors Corporation could increase to $19 billion or $20 billion by the end of 1993, up from $14 billion, the auto maker said in documents distributed today.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, G.M. said it might be forced to take a $1.8 billion charge against equity by the end of the year to reflect the higher liability. The charge would not affect earnings but would reduce shareholder equity. 
 G.M. noted that long-term interest rates "are at their lowest level in 20 years," which depresses the yield on bonds held in the auto maker's pension portfolio. Rates dropped about one percentage point in the first quarter, but have gone back up about a quarter percentage point since April, a spokesman said. The $6 billion increase in unfunded liability would occur if the percentage-point drop held through October.
The possible increase in unfunded pension liability was disclosed after the stock market closed today. But the news should not have come as a surprise, analysts said, because G.M. had been quietly spreading the word for weeks.
"I've heard numbers as high as $20 billion," said Jack V. Kirnan, automotive analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.
G.M. shares lost $1 today, closing at $40.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 30 points.
If the forecast for a higher liability holds true, the rise may force G.M. to increase its contributions to the pension fund, putting additional pressure on cash flow for capital outlays and other corporate purposes, Mr. Kirnan said. And it may also provide a stark reminder to the United Automobile Workers union during contract talks this summer that G.M. is a weak company.
But a G.M. spokesman said that an increase of $5 billion or $6 billion in its pension liability would not affect the criteria used to determine the corporation's cash flow or its plan to fund the pension fund in full by 2000.
 The plan to cover the unfunded liability assumes the pension fund's assets will earn a return of approximately 10 percent a year -- a rate of growth that G.M. described as "realistic and prudent." The pension fund has earned, on average, 14.4 percent in the last 10 years, the company said.
Last year, G.M. contributed $1.2 billion to its pension fund, the spokesman said, and this year it will contribute at least $2 billion.
Lower interest rates may also have an impact on G.M.'s post-retirement health-care liability, raising it by $5 billion, to $43.4 billion, according to the S.E.C. filing.
Neither the increase in its unfunded pension liability nor the increase in its health benefit liability would have an impact on the company's earnings in 1993, the filing said.

HEADLINE: 'The Corner': Where Immigrants and Jobs Intersect;
Mamaroneck's Informal Job Market Offers a Sweat-of-the-Brow Kind of Foreign Aid

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAMARONECK, N.Y., May 13

 BODY:
Dawn had just broken, but already the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Van Ranst Place was buzzing. As a red sports car pulled up to the curb, about a dozen men sprinted to its side from a nearby park, all of them craning to get a word with the driver.
Moments later, the crowd was dispersing, except for Benny Lorensana, a 22-year-old native of Guatemala, who climbed into the passenger seat, flashing the thumb's up sign as the car sped off. 
 For Mr. Lorensana and the other Hispanic immigrants who gather here every morning, "the corner," as it is known, is the only thing standing between them and destitution. The men, many of whom are living in this country without proper documentation, are day laborers. Each shows up here, rain or shine, with the hope of securing a day's work as a painter, gardener, construction worker or carpenter from contractors and small-business owners who need extra help.
"It's very hard to get a job in anything nowadays," said Sister Laura Reynolds of St. Vito's Church in Mamaroneck, who has helped the workers adapt to life here, away from their homes and the families that many of them left behind in Mexico, El Salvador, Peru and Honduras.
As many as 60 workers show up on the corner each day, and they estimate that each is selected to work about three of every six days that he stands on the corner.
"That's enough for them to live on and send money home," Sister Laura said. "I look at it as a kind of foreign aid. It's a sure way to get money into the hands of the poor people of their countries."
No one knows for certain how many corners like this exist in the New York metropolitan region. Miguel Maldonado, a community organizer with the Center for Immigrants Rights in Manhattan, said he counsels day laborers on this corner and a dozen others in Westchester County, Brooklyn, Queens and New Jersey. And he believes the struggling economy is making such spots increasingly attractive to employers and workers alike.
 
Learning About Laws
 Among the things that the workers in this Westchester village have learned from Mr. Maldonado is that, regardless of problems with their citizenship, they are protected by New York State labor laws, which entitle them to earn the minimum wage, $4.25 an hour, and to collect overtime.
The laborers, who have been gathering in Mamaroneck for about five years, have gradually earned the admiration of this community, which is heavily populated by descendants of a wave of Italian and Irish immigration in the early 20th century. But relations were not always smooth.
The workers' original meeting place, in front of the Mamaroneck Metro-North station, prompted a flurry of complaints from commuters, including reports that the men were sometimes urinating in public and tying up traffic, said Chief Joseph DelBianco of the village police.
Last spring local community groups and village officials helped work out a compromise with the men that moved them to their current location, several hundred yards behind the station. Chief DelBianco said the complaints had stopped. The workers' spirit, the Chief said, has reminded him of stories of his father's immigration to America from Italy.
"I know it was tough for my father, who was a stonemason when he got here," Chief DelBianco said. "He tried to hustle for a buck. I see the same work ethic in the Latinos. They want to build a life for themselves."
 
Formed Labor Association
 The workers have overcome problems with their employers, too, shunning those who have bounced checks or refused to pay them in full.
"The people who used to cheat us, we know them very well," said Jaime Savino, 34, who was born in Guatemala and has lived in Mamaroneck for four years. "We tell the brothers, 'This guy doesn't pay.' "
Thanks in part to Mr. Maldonado, the organizer who was recruited last year by local community groups, the men have formed their own labor association, established a minimum asking price ($60 for a day's work) and arranged to take free English classes three times a week at St. Vito's church. They hope to use proceeds from a planned raffle -- an electronic Spanish-English translator is among the prizes -- to rent an indoor meeting place someday.
With pride, the men point to success stories like Jorge Gonzalez, 43, a Peruvian who moved to Mamaroneck three years ago and who, because of his persistent efforts on the corner, has held a steady job as a painter for the last three months.
Mr. Gonzalez, whose wife and three children remain in Peru, said he still visited the corner before his job starts in the morning because of the camaraderie.
"We're not competitive," he said.
 
'A Needed Service'
 Once or twice a week, said Nick Condro, 37, the owner of a landscaping business in the village, he hires a man to help him maintain about 20 lawns and gardens in town.
"They provide a needed service for the community," he said, after motioning one of the men into his black van. "They don't bother anyone."
"I always like to make sure they eat because you never know," he added. "It may sound corny, but it's true."
Although Mamaroneck seems to have accepted the workers, Vernon Briggs, a professor of labor economics at Cornell University, said he was critical of any situation in which an illegal alien takes a job that could have been filled by an American citizen or someone with a green card.
"I think it undermines labor standards," he said. "I'm opposed to anything that encourages illegal immigration to exist or continue."
Nevertheless, Carlos Najara, 52, a Guatemalan who was elected the first president of the workers' association last spring, said he takes pride in what he and the other laborers have accomplished in Mamaroneck, particularly their dogged presence on the corner 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year.
"For us, there is no cold or heat," he said. "We're here."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher After Report Of Rise in Consumer Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against most leading currencies yesterday after the Government reported a bigger-than-expected gain in consumer prices and improved retail sales in April.
The dollar was buoyed early in New York by the Labor Department report that consumer prices over all rose four-tenths of 1 percent in April. Analysts had expected a two-tenths of 1 percent rise. 
 The increase in consumer prices, on top of Wednesday's report that producer prices also rose last month, means that the Federal Reserve is not likely to cut interest rates anytime soon. Lower American interest rates would make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
 
 
Retail Sales
 The Commerce Department's report that retail sales rose 1.2 percent in April is also likely to deter the Fed from reducing interest rates, traders said.
In New York, the dollar ended the day at 111.80 Japanese yen, up from 111.55 yen on Wednesday. The dollar also rose to 1.6175 German marks, up from 1.6105 marks Wednesday.
"There wasn't enough in the data to get us to 1.6200 marks," Earl Johnson, a foreign exchange adviser at Harris Trust and Savings Bank, said. "There's just too much uncertainty about the U.S. economy for the dollar to sustain an up move."
The dollar was also reined in by demand for German marks in the wake of Spain's and Portugal's decisions to devalue their currencies, traders said.
With the 8 percent devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the 6.5 percent devaluation of the Portuguese escudo "there was across-the-board demand for marks," said Carl Amendola, vice president at Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, said. "That capped the dollar's rise."
Meanwhile, the British pound slipped in New York to $1.5200 from $1.5340.

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:
There's no making sense of this spring's auctions in New York. Even the experts, trying to analyze the sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art in the last two weeks, are baffled. Taken as a whole, the sales at Sotheby's and Christie's were a four-night roller-coaster ride on which the highs rose beyond anyone's expectations and the lows hit with a resounding thud.
Instead of one solid auction market, this spring's sales, which ended on Wednesday night, showed a market divided. The difference between a weak market for contemporary art and a strong one for Impressionist and modern art was glaringly apparent, what with an utterly disastrous sale of Andy Warhols at Sotheby's one week and a record $28.6 million price for a Cezanne at the same house the next. 
 In contrast with the Impressionist and modern buyers, the players in the contemporary-art marketplace are a totally different and larger group who follow trends more closely. Even in more consistent times, it has historically been a more volatile segment of the market. Contemporary art saw the greatest inflation in the boom years of the late 1980's and the most violent crash in the slump that began two years ago. And judging by the results of the sales at both Christie's and Sotheby's last week, the contemporary-art market is still struggling.
To compare sales totals is to notice the difference between the two markets. Sotheby's sale of contemporary art totaled $15.4 million, while Christie's auction made $14.3 million. By contrast, Sotheby's Impressionist and modern auction made $86.84 million, and Christie's brought in $59.9 million.
 
The Champion: Impressionism
 The strength of the Impressionist and modern sales was by far the biggest surprise. At moments in both auctions, it felt like 1989 again, that golden year of record highs and bidding wars, when even paintings deemed hard to sell by the experts were fought over. This season, estate property, the bread and butter of the auction houses, was scarce, and many collectors who didn't have to sell preferred to hold off, waiting for a clear signal that prices were on the rise. But both Sotheby's and Christie's were able to secure a few great paintings. And each brought great prices.
By far the star of the last two weeks was Cezanne's "Still Life With Apples," from 1890-94, which sold for a staggering $28.6 million at Sotheby's on Tuesday night, setting a record for the artist. (The previous record for a Cezanne was $17.1 million paid at Christie's in London in November 1989, at the top of the market.) The price was particularly amazing when you consider that two years ago Sotheby's entire spring sale of Impressionist and modern works made only $18 million. The painting was sold by George Embiricos, the Greek shipping magnate who had bought it for $252,000 at a sale of the well-known Jakob Goldschmidt collection in 1958 at Sotheby's in London. "I don't think there was anyone who would have guessed the Cezanne would go that high," said Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's president and chief executive. "It means a picture can bring more than $25 million again, and that's very encouraging."
Also encouraging for Sotheby's were results from several other top works up for sale that night. Among them was Matisse's "Fatma the Mulatto," from 1912, which sold for a healthy $14.3 million, just $200,000 shy of a record for the artist. The price surpassed Sotheby's estimate of $10 million to $13 million. "Fatma," one of the artist's great Moroccan figure paintings, was sold by the heirs of Josef Muller, a celebrated collector from Solothurn, Switzerland.
Perhaps the painting's price was a sign that the Matisse fever seen in November isn't over. Last fall's auctions coincided with the Museum of Modern Art's Matisse retrospective, an event that experts say helped inflate prices for the artist's works. Two works in particular, "Asia" and "Harmony in Yellow," sold in November for $11 million and $14.5 million, respectively. At Christie's on Tuesday night, a beautiful, though less important, Matisse fared well, too. "Laurette With a Cup of Coffee," from 1916-17, estimated at $800,000 to $1 million, was bought by the New York dealer Richard Feigen for $1.04 million.
 
The Middle Ground
 While Christie's sale on Wednesday night had no $20 million-plus paintings, the auction clearly rode the crest of Sotheby's success the night before. Its blockbuster work, Monet's "Jetty at Havre," sold for $9.6 million, just below Christie's high estimate of $10 million. The painting was being sold by Motoaki Ishizuka, a Japanese inventor who is an active collector. Another high price was paid for Degas's "Russian Dancers." from 1895, estimated at $2.5 million to $3.5 million. After a round of particularly aggressive bidding it finally brought $6.2 million, nearly double its pre-sale estimate.
"There was more bidding than at any sale I can remember, even at the top of the market," said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York. But he warned that estimates should remain conservative. Indeed, while basking in the week's success, experts at both auction houses are cautious, pointing out that except for the top works, general price levels have fallen back to 1987-88 figures. "It's still a very tender market," Mr. Burge added. "But the fact that we saw more activity is an encouraging sign."
At Sotheby's the most expensive works sold beyond anyone's expectations, but the so-called middle-market, those works in the $500,000 realm that have suffered the most during the last two years, fell flat during the house's high-priced evening sale. At Christie's, on the other hand, it was just these mediocre works that caused a flurry of bidding as collectors from all over the world snapped them up in multiples. "There was a hunger to buy," said David Nash, the international director of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department. "A lot of collectors who bought at Christie's on Wednesday night were the same people who failed to get pictures at Sotheby's on Tuesday night. The money is there, and confidence is back."
There is money even for artists who couldn't get a bid two years ago. Two in particular, Renoir and Chagall, both of whom have been suffering since the Japanese dropped out of the market, made a surprising comeback. At Sotheby's on Tuesday night, Chagall's "Flowers," from 1925, expected to bring $800,000 to $1 million, nearly reached its high estimate, selling for $992,500. Each house had its share of Renoirs, and the best of them were fiercely fought over. At Christie's, "Leontine Lisant," from 1909, estimated at $2.8 million to $3.2 million, sold to an anonymous collector for $2.9 million. At Sotheby's, "Woman in the Garden" (1873) also provoked a bidding frenzy, selling for $6.7 million, well above its high estimate of $2.5 million to $3.5 million.
 
The Big Losers
 What happened to Magritte was another story. Last fall's hugely successful Magritte retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art did little to enhance the artist's worth. Three Magrittes went unsold at Sotheby's. At Christie's, two out of three found buyers, but just a little above their low estimates.
But no artist fared so badly as Warhol, whose poor performance was the talk of the art world. In a time when good contemporary art was hard for both auction houses to come by, Sotheby's, in what appeared to be a move of desperation, put 12 Warhols in one sale. Ten of them belonged to Frederick W. Hughes, who was Warhol's manager for 25 years and is now the executor of the artist's estate and chairman emeritus of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Two belonged to private collectors. Only two of the 12 works were sold, and barely. "Old Telephone," from 1961, estimated at $600,000 to $800,000, sold for $552,500. And "Princess Diana," from 1982, estimated at $60,000 to $80,000, sold for $57,500.
The Warhol failure affected the entire contemporary market. Sotheby's sale had a deathly air about it. Painting after painting elicited not so much as a bid. The total for the contemporary sale, a meager $8.8 million, was less than half the house's estimate of $18.4 million to $24.7 million. For one night, the market had sunk back to the levels of 1990-91, when experts said prices had bottomed out.
 
A Pollock in Dispute
 Christie's contemporary-art sale fared better the next night, but none of its four Warhols sold. What did sell successfully was Jackson Pollock's drip painting "No. 19, 1948," which was bought by an unidentified European for $2.4 million, right above its $2 million high estimate. While the price was respectable, Christie's is having a bit of a problem with the sale of the painting, whose ownership is being challenged in New York Surrogate's Court in Manhattan. The dispute is between the executor of the estate of Janet Hauck, widow of the Abstract Expressionist painter Fred Hauck, and her daughter, who contends that the painting is really hers. A hearing has been set for May 24. If a clear title can't be given, then the buyer must return the painting.
But even the title dispute, of which Christie's informed its audience the night of the sale, didn't stop bidding, which just goes to show that if the auction houses can obtain top material, they can sell it, and in many cases for extraordinary prices. Just who's been buying, however, is often veiled in a kind of mystery both auction houses relish. In fact, it's what keeps spectators coming to watch each season.
"All the old hands were bidding, less of the glitterati and more the people in the know," said Mr. Burge. He added that buyers were from both the United States and abroad, including Mexico and even Japan, for the first time in two years. "There were also dealers bidding," he added. "Some obviously buying for clients, but some for dealers' stock, which means they are willing to invest in the market's continued growth."

Sheehan Seeks to Climb Higher Than the Pinnacle

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., May 13

 BODY:
After earning her way into the toughest Hall of Fame in sports, Patty Sheehan has taken on a new mission: to prove that her career is still thriving.
When Sheehan won the Standard Register Ping in Phoenix in March, she became only the 13th player to achieve the 30 victories needed for entry into the Ladies Professional Golf Association's Hall of Fame. It also made her an instant has-been. At the the next tournament, a note from a fellow Hall member, JoAnne Carner, was taped to her locker. It read, "Welcome to the Old Ladies Club." 
 But at age 36, in her 14th season on the L.P.G.A. Tour, Sheehan fiercely resists any suggestion that it is time for her to gracefully fade from the top echelon of the women's game.
"I just can't stop with getting into the Hall of Fame," said Sheehan today after she shot a three-under-par 68 in the first round of the McDonald's Championship, two strokes off the pace set by Laura Davies and Gail Graham.
"I'm not like that," she continued. "I'm not a quitter. I'll quit when I run out of fun and competitive juices, when I get tired of it. But I'm a long way from that. The Hall of Fame wasn't the end of anything. It was the beginning of the rest of my career."
Actually, Sheehan's career received a major shot of adrenalin last year when she won the United States Women's Open, at Oakmont, Pa., in an 18-hole playoff against Juli Inkster. That victory, her 29th, made the 5-foot-3-inch Vermonter with the flawless swing believe that her best golf is still ahead.
"There is more for me to do out here," she said. "I want to win another U.S. Open. I want to win a Dinah Shore. I want to be the L.P.G.A. player of the year again."
Still, golf hasn't been easy for Sheehan since her landmark victory in Phoenix. She finished no better than ninth in her five subsequent tournaments, including a missed cut at Atlanta and a tie for 54th last week in Nashville.
Sheehan admits experiencing "a tremendous feeling of relief," at entering the Hall of Fame. But she denies that she experienced an emotional letdown similar to that of Pat Bradley, who has not won since earning her 30th career victory in 1991. Bradley, who has admitted she is searching for a new goal, shot a 73 today.
"I can see the tendency would be for that to happen," said Sheehan, "but I haven't felt a letdown."
One reason is simple economics. Sheehan lost her northern California home in the October 1989 earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay Area, and she says she still has a way to go before she feels economically secure.
"I have given myself another four or five years to play," she said, "but that's hard to say. But who is to know what will happen. I may have to play. I'm hoping I will be financially sound."
Sheehan still possesses a healthy dose of insecurity and the never-ending drive to overcome it.
"I want to win my 31st real bad," she said. "I want to stop people from asking me if I will ever win again. Of course, I always get in my own way when I try really hard."
Sheehan's round today was a relaxed affair in which she made four birdies and one bogey over the par-71 DuPont Country Club. It was her lowest 18 holes since the final round 65 at Phoenix.
In a tournament she has won twice, the last time in 1990, Sheehan should be dangerous.
"This would be a great way to get back on track," said Sheehan. "I'm so anxious to get on with the rest of my career."

HEADLINE: History by the Hour or the Day

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
SPRING is the season of noble intentions. The old, shriveled winter creature you behold in the mirror cries out for renewal, and so does the gray-tinged complexion. What better way to register the change of season than a self-improvement program that combines outdoor recreation with mental stimulation? Both in moderation, of course.
An ideal spring program is at hand in the dozens of small towns and cities across Connecticut, each with its own historical society, that offer walking tours. Some are guided by local historians, on a fixed schedule or as demand arises. Others are self-guided. That is, history-minded flaneurs can pick up a brochure and set forth, beholding the local wonders, free to think their own thoughts and form their own impressions. 
 A few towns, like Hartford and Litchfield, rent or sell audiocassette guides, allowing visitors to stroll or drive as they like. This may be the wave of the future. This summer, the Huntington Historical Society will offer a cassette guide to Southport narrated by Jason Robards.
Not all tours are created equal. Some focus on architecture, others on local worthies and eminent trees, while others memorialize the brief, sometimes ephemeral brushes with greatness every town likes to claim.
Wethersfield had its moment. Until the late 18th century, it was known primarily for its red onions and an infestation of witches in the 1640's that included a husband-and-wife team. In May 1781, however, destiny came knocking at the door of Joseph Webb, a merchant. Into his red clapboard house on Main Street walked George Washington, accompanied by the Comte de Rochambeau. The two men, sitting at a table in what is now called the Council Room, laid plans for a decisive southward push by American and French forces.
Washington slept not one but four nights at the stark, rather barnlike clapboard structure, which was built in the 1750's and still stands steady as a rock, flanked by two other mid-18th-century houses. Together, the three make up the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum, and they are the subject of a one-hour guided tour that is strong on the details of domestic life and Colonial architecture.
Visitors who note with surprise the rather flashy interior colors of the Webb house, which includes a stunning china cupboard in blue, mustard and red with a scallop-shell dome, will find out that early American homes relied on bright interior paints to lighten rooms that had no electricity.
Visitors will take pleasure in the large and quite realistic plastic turkey on the dining room table of the Silas Deane house, and the surrounding pies and vegetable dishes indicating a Thanksgiving feast. (The meal is due to undergo a seasonal change.)
Because several of the Deanes fell victim to tuberculosis, an upstairs bedroom has been set up as a sickroom, with a handsome mahogany medicine chest on a night stand. One of the chest's small drawers contains strands of copper wire, and by way of explanation, my guide delivered the kind of eye-opening 30-minute treatise that fully justified the $5 cost of the tour.
"The copper wires were stirred in vinegar, and the resulting chemical reaction created verdigris," she said. "When you mixed it with a liquid to disguise the taste and then drank it, it alleviated chest pains, although it did nothing for the tuberculosis. So if you ever see a little drawer like that with copper wires in it, that's what they were for."
With my store of knowledge increased to the tune of one eminently repeatable fact, I felt edified, yet not fatigued. This was as good as anything in "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure."
Wethersfield is the ideal town for a half-day history tour. One of the most perfectly preserved Colonial towns in Connecticut, it has 150 buildings dating before 1850, and the Olde Towne Tourism District -- yes, unfortunately, that's how it's spelled -- has a detailed brochure with an annotated map that allows visitors to stroll, look and absorb at their own pace.
For atmosphere, read "The Witch of Blackbird Pond," by Elizabeth Speare, or "Harvest Home" and "The Other," by Thomas Tryon. All are set in Wethersfield. Then walk up and down Main Street, making sure to press as far north as Wethersfield Cove, the town's thriving harbor until a flood in 1692 swept away six warehouses and permanently altered the Connecticut River's course. Overnight, the port became an inlet.
On the way back, take a detour to see the Buttolph-Williams House (1720) on Broad Street. Imposing and stern, it figures prominently in "The Witch of Blackbird Pond."
Finish up with a visit to the Ancient Burying Ground, where, legend has it, the nine victims of the 1637 massacre that touched off the Pequot War are buried. The Wethersfield Historical Society offers tours and a printed guide to the cemetery.
The Industrial Revolution passed Wethersfield by. Instead of machine shops and mills, the 19th century left the gentle, benevolent legacy of Comstock, Ferre (pronouced Ferry), the oldest continually operating seed company in the United States.
Stop in and buy a 79-cent packet of seeds for the famous Wethersfield red onion, which was once shipped from the cove to ports up and down the East Coast, and all the way to the Orient.
The store's manager, Roger Willard, is rather restrained in his sales pitch for the local product. "There's nothing so great about it," he said, "except that it made Wethersfield famous."
 
A Town Near Hartford
 Just a few miles west of Wethersfield is the once-mighty town of Farmington, so famous in the 19th century that when Mark Twain was introduced to Queen Victoria as a citizen of Hartford, he pointed out, helpfully, that Hartford was a town near Farmington.
Farmington is another half-day town with some good history to it, and, of course, a local historical society with a can-do attitude.
Visitors should make tracks to the Farmington Historical Society for a brochure on the Amistad Sights Walking Tour, a 10-stop proposition that traces Farmington's role in the events surrounding the first civil rights case to reach the Supreme Court.
In 1839, 53 adults and children from the Mende region of Sierra Leone, who had been captured and enslaved, were being transported from Havana to Puerto Rico aboard the ship Amistad. After a storm blew the ship out to sea, and rations were depleted, the Africans, led by Sengbe Pieh, known as Joseph Cinque, rose up, killed the captain and the cook, seized control of the ship and tried to head back to Africa.
Instead, the ship touched land at Montauk Point, L.I., where the Coast Guard picked up the men and transported them to New Haven, where they were put on trial for mutiny and murder. The court ruled that because the Africans had never been slaves before their abduction, they could not be returned to Cuba nor be held liable for their acts.
The decision was appealed and went to the Supreme Court, where John Quincy Adams helped argue the case for the defense. The high court upheld the lower court's decision.
The Amistad case galvanized the Abolitionist movement. Farmington, an abolitionist hotbed and a stop on the underground railroad, played host to the Mende natives, who lived and worked in the town while money was raised to send them back to Africa.
Carol Leonard, head of the Farmington Historical Society, occasionally leads tours of the Amistad Sights trail, by request.
A second local historian, Ernest R. Shaw, runs a little business called Heritage Trails Sightseeing Tours. Most of the time, he's busy taking small bands of tourists around Hartford, but his spring schedule includes two Farmington tours.
On the first, the "Ancient Evening Cemetery Tour," Mr. Shaw takes visitors through two graveyards, one dating from 1660. Informed sources say that there is sometimes a little surprise in one of them that elicits some shrieks. There are tours tomorrow and May 29 to 31, then a long pause before the Halloween season.
Every Saturday in May, Mr. Shaw explores the area's Indian heritage on his "Indian Canoe Adventure," which includes a canoe ride up the Farmington River and a historically accurate lunch of bear meat or wild fowl and ground corn. Tour members are sent into the fields to pick wild onions and ferns for a salad.
Mr. Shaw's most unusual tour takes place tomorrow, when he leads visitors along the locks and brownstone bridges of the old Farmington Canal. "Even Connecticut people are unaware there was an 80-mile canal, hand-dug, that ran from New Haven and ended up in Northampton, Mass., on the Connecticut River," he said. It's a striking illustration of the truth that economics is not beanbag. "The idea was to put Hartford out of business," Mr. Shaw said.
Hartford had the last laugh. The canal opened in 1828 and went bankrupt 19 years later, a victim of the railroads.
The saga of the Farmington Canal serves as a reminder that history more often than not has a harsh tale to tell. In the struggle to survive and prosper, some Connecticut towns won; others lost, and lost painfully.
 
The Brass Capital
 Waterbury, which won and lost in spectacular fashion, is a town that deserves its own Gibbon. Once known as the brass capital of the world, it employed tens of thousands of workers in vast factories that cast, rolled, stamped and worked brass, the 19th-century equivalent of plastic, into a thousand articles of domestic and industrial use, including pins, buttons, kettles, architectural hardware, lighting devices, photographic equipment and the famous Ingersoll dollar watches that sold in the millions. By 1890, the city was producing 60 percent of the nation's brass.
In the city's heyday, from 1850 to the end of World War I, the brass barons and the wealthy professionals of Waterbury built some dazzling houses and mansions in the Hillside District, which has 327 buildings listed with the National Register of Historic Places. The reigning style is Queen Anne, that is, an eclectic (some would say indiscriminate) conglomeration of turrets, towers, wraparound porches, peaks and gables, with bright colors pointing up the gingerbread details.
New Yorkers will find some familiar names in Waterbury. Fulton Park was created by the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park with Calvert Vaux. Waterbury's brick, marble and granite city hall is one of five buildings designed by Cass Gilbert, the architect who designed the Woolworth Building and the Custom House in Manhattan.
The Mattatuck Museum in downtown Waterbury is a lively little institution with an innovative program of history tours that allow visitors to get a fix on the social and architectural history of Hillside and the Gilbert district and also venture into the newer area of industrial history.
It offers a bicycle or trolley tour that retraces Waterbury's manufacturing history. In addition to stopping off at industrial sites, the tour takes pains to provide a kind of illustrated social history. On Wood Street and Oak Street, the Scovill Company built two-story single-family row houses during World War I, each with a different facade to reflect a different national style, for their managers. The workers got barracks.
The tour is also valuable in lending specificity to arid terms like "industrial decline" and "retooling for the future." It is a poignant reminder of how difficult it is for a town to refashion its self-image. The signs of that struggle are evident everywhere in Waterbury, which has sagged badly since the brass industry moved overseas in the 1950's.
"I've been really impressed with the craftsmen here," said Marianne Vandenburgh, a former Ohioan who now owns the House on the Hill, a bed-and-breakfast establishment on Hillside, who is in the midst of a kitchen renovating project. "I think it's because this is a town where people made things, and the tradition of working with your hands has been passed along from grandfather to father to grandson. That also may be a reason why it's hard for Waterbury to think of itself in a different way."
Despite its troubles, Waterbury has beauty and charm. As a historical text, it makes rich reading, and its most compelling chapters may well be those of sad decline, which, as Gibbon knew, speaks more truthfully about the human condition than the triumphant ascent.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRAT MOCKS HEALTH-CARE IDEA

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
An influential Congressman said today that managed competition, the health policy favored by President Clinton, is "a fairy tale" and would probably not be the basis for any legislation passed by Congress to overhaul the nation's health-care system.
Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, made the comments as he issued a report from the Congressional Budget Office. The report said the strategy of managed competition could reduce health-care spending, but the study expressed doubt whether Americans were willing to make the radical changes needed to achieve such savings. 
 Mr. Stark's comments came 15 days after Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, ridiculed managed competition by likening it to supply-side economics and "Star Wars." Quite apart from the merits of such criticism, it appears that the two Democrats are pleading publicly with the Administration to scale down and reconsider its plan to overhaul the health-care system.
 
Clinton Faces Party Critics
 Mr. Stark's position is no surprise. For years, he has argued that Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, should be expanded to cover all Americans. But the comments of Mr. Stark and Mr. Rostenkowski show that the President will have to deal with critics in his own party, including lawmakers who will be responsible for shepherding Mr. Clinton's proposal through Congress.
As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rostenkowski has a large role in writing health-care legislation and tax bills. Mr. Clinton has said he intends to send his proposal to Congress next month.
Hillary Rodham Clinton and her task force on health care say they have consulted extensively with Congress. But Mr. Stark said: "We are kept in the dark. We have been asked to support a bill or a plan without knowing the details."
Advocates of managed competition say it will empower consumers. Under the plan, individuals and small businesses would pool their resources and buy health care from competing networks organized by doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. In theory, these networks would vie with one another by offering high-quality care at low prices.
 
Dissent From White House
 The Congressional Budget Office observed that managed competition "has not been tried anywhere in the world." Mr. Stark likened it to a unicorn, "a beautiful animal in fairyland, but unseen on earth."
Mr. Stark said one of the problems with managed competition is that hardly anybody "can explain it." Indeed, he said, with reference to President Clinton, "I don't think he knows what it is."
Robert O. Boorstin, a White House spokesman, said: "We have not completely reviewed the report by the Congressional Budget Office. But I don't believe that it is a valid critique of the plan we are going to arrive at."

HEADLINE: Senator Sues Over Lost Trust Fund

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri sued Paine Webber Group Inc. and a former Paine Webber investment adviser today, charging that he lost more than $1 million from a blind trust because of the adviser's "Federal securities fraud."
Mr. Bond, a lawyer who comes from a wealthy brick-making family, opened the trust in 1973 to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest when he was elected Governor of Missouri. Such trusts became common after Watergate led to an increase in concern over politicians' ethics. 
 As a member of the Appropriations, Banking and Small Business committees, Mr. Bond, a Republican, has played a leading role in economic legislation.
Mr. Bond's suit in Federal court in St. Louis charges that William J. Reik of Manhattan, a former Paine Webber employee, mismanaged the Senator's portfolio by concentrating its assets in "three thinly traded and illiquid securities," according to a statement from the Senator.
The statement said that Mr. Reik had illegally manipulated the price of three stocks, had failed to follow instructions to diversify the portfolio and had neglected to disclose conflicts of interest "between his management of a Paine Webber fund and separate advisory accounts like Bond's."
 
'Totally Wiped Out'
 Under the terms of the trust, Mr. Bond was not supposed to know the identity or nature of his investments.
In the statement, Mr. Bond said: "My investments were totally wiped out. I have filed suit to recover what I have lost." The suit seeks $1,050,000 in damages.
Maureen Fantz, assistant manager of public relations for Paine Webber, said, "We're aware of the claim for the lawsuit, and we intend to defend it vigorously. We have no further comment."
Richard Martens, a lawyer in West Palm Beach, Fla., who represents Mr. Reik, said by telephone tonight that "we intend to defend what we believe is a frivolous lawsuit."
"Unlike the Senator," he added, "we do not intend to try this case in the press; we intend to try it in the courtroom, where it belongs."
Mr. Bond said in his statement that Mr. Reik had been employed by Paine Webber for 14 years before he was dismissed in 1991 "for compliance problems related to his handling of clients' accounts.
"He has been the subject of numerous customer complaints and various investigations by regulatory agencies," the statement said.
 
More Debt Than Assets
 Mr. Bond's staff made the lawsuit available for inspection in his office this evening. In the filing, Mr. Bond said he only learned of the full extent of his financial troubles early this year, after he notified the Ethics Committee of his intention to terminate the blind trust.
"Reik represented to Bond that his investment strategy was conservative," court papers say, adding that soon after, Mr. Reik liquidated the portfolio and invested the money in risky stocks.
The suit asserts that Mr. Reik persuaded Senator Bond to borrow money and add it to the trust fund to buy more stock, so that the trust fund became "in effect, a margin account."
In the fall of 1989, the Senator's older brother, Arthur D. Bond Jr., reviewed the portfolio and expressed concern about its concentration in the three stocks. According to the court filing, Senator Bond told Mr. Reik that his investments were "inappropriate and should be more diversified," but Mr. Reik failed to change the trust's portfolio.
By December 1990, the suit says, the Senator's investment in the three stocks -- Neutrogena, Tejon Ranch and Frisch's Restaurants -- had declined in value from $1 million to $543,000, against the portfolio's outstanding loans of $595,000.
Mr. Bond met Mr. Reik, an investment advisor at Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management, a registered agent of Paine Webber in Wilmington Del., in 1985 and transferred his trust account to him from Wilmington Trust.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON TAX BILL;
Clinton Readies A Drive to 'Sell' Budget to People

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Eager to show Congress that he still has the political wherewithal needed to muscle through his budget bill, President Clinton has planned a new offensive to sell it as a blueprint for tax fairness.
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton plans a spate of public appearances beginning Friday with his third formal news conference and continuing next week with a trip to New Mexico and California to show his commitment to turning the economy around. 
 One political adviser to the President described the rush of activity -- larded with full measures of anti-Washington rhetoric and populist imagery -- as a White House attempt to regain the initiative by "defining things our way."
The defining began today with a mild White House appraisal of potentially troubling economic news: a rise in consumer prices of 0.4 percent in April.
 
Hoping for a 'Blip'
 "It's not -- I want to watch it and we will be watching it, but it could be just a blip," the adviser said. "There are lots of things that could have produced it. We'll just have to see."
White House officials were pleased today when the House Ways and Means Committee approved the major portions of Mr. Clinton's tax plan, which includes higher rates for the wealthy and corporations. They were also happy to take the advice of Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the committee, who said the President should do more to whip up support for his plan among the citizenry.
 
Striving for a Focus
 "The pitch you make to them is that this is a fair package," said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director. "It balances between spending cuts and tax increases. It makes sure that those who made the most pay the most in taxes, and it makes sure that the middle class is treated fairly."
Mr. Clinton is striving for the focus that he admitted last week he had lost. When a businessman approached him today to advise him to push harder for a plan he has already endorsed -- the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act -- that would speed up highway construction spending, Mr. Clinton advised patience.
"Let's try to go ahead and pass the budget now and get out of this whole issue about whether it was increasing the deficit or not, blow that away, and then we'll try to see if we can't get people to focus on the, on the I.S.T.E.A. issue alone," he said.
As the President was honing a populist message, he was returning from a New York fund-raising event where he had helped the Democratic Party raise more than $3 million. Last Friday, he announced a campaign-finance reform plan that would limit contributions to political parties, including unregulated "soft money" contributions that made up part of Wednesday's take.
 
Playing by the Rules
 The $1,500-a-head dinner at Lincoln Center, which featured the entertainers Whoopi Goldberg, Barry Manilow, Carly Simon and Sharon Stone, allowed contributors to make donations to the party under current rules that allow $20,000 to be given in a calendar year. Mr. Stephanopoulos said the Clinton Administration would play by the new rules it has proposed when the legislation is passed -- not before.
"We're not going to engage in unilateral disarmament," he said.
Mr. Clinton has been building toward his latest appeal for several days. In travels to Cleveland and to the suburbs of Chicago earlier this week, he derided Washington politicians as out of touch, a theme he is likely to repeat when he holds a televised town meeting in San Diego on Monday night. He is also scheduled to visit Los Alamos, N.M., on Monday and Los Angeles on Tuesday.
Mr. Stephanopoulos resisted suggestions that Mr. Clinton might have a difficult time selling new taxes, especially in states like California that have been slow to join the recovery.
"Does the middle class have to contribute along with everyone else?" Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "Yes, a little bit. But all in the interest of bringing the deficit down and getting this economy moving again and creating jobs in the future."
 
Path to Salvation?
 But not all Democrats are convinced that the President is doing the best thing by hitting the road. "It's not where the President is," said Brian Lunde, a Democratic consultant. "It's what is he doing or saying."
Mr. Clinton, however, looks to the road that leads out of Washington as the path to his political salvation. Speaking before a friendly audience at a dinner of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights earlier this week, he gave voice to some of his frustration at learning the ways of Washington.
"Why don't we behave in Washington the way people behave in their normal lives?" he said. "We need opportunity and responsibility."

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON TAX BILL: Reporter's Notebook;
Some Familiar Fiddling In a Big, Stately Setting

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
The cavernous hearing room of the House Ways and Means Committee is one of the most fabulous public spaces that the lower chamber has to show off.
Domed and semicircular, gilded and friezed, the room is a stage-designer setting for momentous governmental labors like fiddling with the tax code. 
 In October 1986 it was in this room, in the Longworth Office Building across the street from the Capitol, that the committee chairman, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, marshaled his Democratic colleagues to back a Republican initiative, slashing income tax rates and closing scores of loopholes over the fang-and-claw opposition of lobbyists who filled the chamber and spilled into the marble halls.
Today Mr. Rostenkowski was back in the same room, raising the income tax rates he had lowered and reopening some of the loopholes he had closed, and calling it a "major victory" for the economy and the Democratic Administration of President Clinton. A huge pack of lobbyists, fangs bared and claws extended, filled the room and spilled into the marble hallway.
Afterward, an associate of the chairman said it was a bittersweet moment, but that no reform can -- or maybe should -- last forever.
 
The Ascent of Women
 When Mr. Rostenkowski presided over the 1986 version of tax overhaul, the lobbyists, excluded from the closed meetings, loitered in the elegant corridors for hours on end. Reporters nicknamed the hallways "Gucci Gulch" because many of the men wore Gucci loafers, the Air Jordans of the 1980's influence-seeker.
Gucci Gulch is back, with a twist: the designer logo is plastered on handbags, not loafers. In striking contrast to 1986, more than half the people in the crowd at today's climactic tax-writing session were women. And while many of those were paralegals or aides to more senior lobbyists, many more were not.
"There's the truckers; there's Du Pont," said one female lobbyist, identifying the women in the crowd by the interest they represented. "There are a lot more of us now. I think it's one area where people have gotten accustomed to working with women, because women have been on the tax staffs on the Hill for a while."
As for the Ways and Means panel, there was only only one woman on the committee in 1986 -- Representative Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut. Today there are two: Mrs. Kennelly and Nancy Johnson, also of Connecticut. "Some things," the lobbyist said, "haven't changed much at all."
 
The Quick and the Dead
 Having extracted as much money as could be taken comfortably from the living, the Ways and Means panelists have turned this week to the dead.
The story: For a decade now, the Social Security Administration has contracted with state vital statistics offices to buy rosters of the recently departed -- lately, at about 20 cents a head -- to insure that its monthly checks are not sent to recipients who no longer need them. Congressional aides say the program has averted a good deal of fraud, and Social Security officials have urged other Federal offices that convey benefits -- 123 of them, in all -- to avail themselves of the lists, too.
But the states have balked at the idea. Thirty-four have inserted exclusivity clauses into their contracts, barring Social Security from sharing any of the names with fellow agencies. And some are brazen about their motives, saying they like the money and want each of the 124 Federal offices to buy the names on its own.
News of this reached the Ways and Means Committee, and the panel is using its budget bill to send a message to the states, in the form of an amendment adopted on Wednesday. It says that if the states don't start allowing Social Security officials to pass around lists of the dead, it will stop allowing the states to use Social Security numbers -- for tax forms, drivers' licenses or anything else.
For a money-hungry Government, this is no small matter. One committee aide said that Federal agencies are dispensing millions of dollars to dead people every month. A General Accounting Office inquiry found that a Civil Service retiree received his monthly pension check until October 1990, although he died in November 1985. The extra payments amounted to $122,333.
"And that," the aide added, "includes cost-of-living adjustments."

HEADLINE: Dow Slides 34.32 as Inflation Fears Grow

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Driven by renewed inflation fears and pursuing the plunging bond market, the stock market fell headlong yesterday.
All major stock indexes dropped in heavy trading, including the American Stock Exchange index, even though vaulting gold prices and gold stocks on the exchange tended to lift it. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 34.32 points to close at 3,447.99, after being down more than 20 points for nearly the entire session. It was the Dow's sharpest drop since April 2, when the index fell 69 points, and it came only a day after the Dow hit a record high.
Yesterday's selloff swept a wide swath of stocks: 21 of the Dow's 30 blue-chip stocks were down. Eight stocks fell 1 point or more, led by J. P. Morgan. The big bank holding company was down 1 7/8, to 66 3/8.
Moreover, the Standard & Poor's 500, with a far greater variety of stocks, showed how broad and deep the selloff was. That index fell 5.57 points, to 439.23. An eye-catching 378 stocks of the index were down, led by such major companies as American Telephone and Telegraph and Pepsico.
 
Major Stock Groups Declining
 The major stock groups declining in the S.& P. 500 were dividend-rich electric utilities like Consolidated Edison, telephone companies and diversified health-care companies like Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceutical company.
The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by smaller-capitalization and high-technology stocks, has tended to perform better than other indexes recently. Even so, the index lost 6.05 points, to 675.64.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 2.79 points, to 243.27, and losing stocks outnumbered winners, 1,412 to 597. About 293.9 million shares changed hands yesterday, compared with 255.7 million shares on Wednesday. The American Stock Exchange market value index dropped 0.52 point, to 427.91.
This week's schedule was heavy with Government economic indicators and three critical Treasury note auctions.
The four-tenths of 1 percent Consumer Price Index rise was double what analysts had expected and indicative of a 4.8 percent annualized inflation rate. That upended most investors' assumptions of a 1993 inflation that would parallel the 1992 rate of 2.9 percent.
Many stock traders had also assumed that with low inflation, the Federal Reserve Board would cut interest rates further, making the stock market an even more attractive place to invest.
After the consumer-price shock, gold contracts for June delivery rose $7.50, to $369.30 an ounce. Five of the 10 most active stocks on the New York and American stock exchanges were gold stocks.
Echo Bay Mines, on the Amex, was the most active gold stock, with 9.1 million shares changing hands. It closed up 3/4 point, to 11 1/4. An exception to the booming gold stocks was Newmont Mining, whose sale of a large stake to George Soros, the financier, helped spark the recent interest in gold. Newmont, on the Big Board, closed down 1/2, to 50.
The most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange was Royal Dutch Petroleum at 13.4 million shares. It closed up 2 1/8 points, to 93 1/8, on surprisingly higher quarterly earnings and the better analyst assessments that followed.

HEADLINE: Trust Me

 BODY:
The details of Bill Clinton's latest pledge to reduce the budget deficit do not matter nearly as much as their symbolism and what they say about Mr. Clinton's determination to repair his own political vulnerability. Having engaged in endless musing about drift and disarray in his Administration, he now seems ready to do something about it.
This week he proposed to sequester "every penny of new taxes and budget cuts" in a "trust fund" to be used only to reduce the Federal deficit. That won't change the outlines of his budget, which calls for $496 billion in deficit reduction from extra taxes, spending cuts and lower interest payments. But it may persuade the public he's serious. 
 Mr. Clinton's credibility on the deficit urgently needed repair. He has been losing the public relations war ever since the long and unsuccessful fight over the stimulus package, which gave opportunists like Bob Dole and Ross Perot all they needed to portray Mr. Clinton as a devious spendthrift.
Democratic leaders warned him that his entire economic package could suffer the same fate if he allowed his opponents to present it as a spending scheme without offsetting cuts. Others worried that a defeat for the tax bill would, by dooming the rest of his economic program, strangle Mr. Clinton's infant Presidency in its crib. The opinion polls were not reassuring either.
Mr. Clinton then hit the road for a week's worth of public repositioning, with the trust fund as his trump card. Republicans like Senator Phil Gramm accused him of a "transparent attempt to mislead." Mr. Dole said he gave "smoke and mirrors" a bad name. Friendlier voices argued that the fund simply gave the public another badly needed level of reassurance that painful tax increases would not be diverted to new programs.
This reading of Mr. Clinton's purposes was embraced by Representative Charles E. Schumer, co-sponsor of a bill establishing a legally separate trust fund. "There is a problem of credibility. The public does not believe we will really cut the deficit when we say we will. . . . Everywhere I went in my district people said, 'We are willing to tighten our belt, but we don't believe you.' "
The Administration's tax proposals passed their first big test when the House Ways and Means Committee approved them yesterday. The President's recent barnstorming was irrelevant because the outcome was foreordained. But stiffer tests lie ahead in the Senate, where Mr. Clinton's newfound fervor on the deficit could make the difference.

HEADLINE: More Power to the Powerful

BYLINE: By Richard Burt; Richard Burt, an assistant secretary of state and Ambassador to West Germany in the Reagan Administration, is a partner at McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It is time to transform the Group of Seven, a loose and often ineffective cluster of rich countries, into a real international steering committee that can deal with the economic and security challenges of the post-cold-war world.
The need for collective action is mounting. With the Balkans in turmoil, Russia unraveling, the world economy stagnating and weapons of mass destruction proliferating to renegade nations such as North Korea, the United States and its G-7 partners can watch the world drift into chaos or can assert leadership. At another turning point, after World War II, Washington provided such leadership. Today, America cannot -- and should not -- play this role on its own. 
 The United Nations is more active but is still hampered by political disagreements, budgetary constraints and an unresponsive bureaucracy. Hopes that the European Community might exercise greater influence have not panned out: Europe's failure in the Yugoslav crisis is a case in point.
The answer is not to invent new international machinery but to give the Group of Seven a bigger mandate. Unlike the United Nations Security Council, the G-7 includes Germany and Japan; the other members are Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- all economically strong, politically democratic and linked to Washington.
The governments, of course, already work together in several areas. But except for regular sessions of finance ministers and central bankers, cooperation has tended to be limited or ineffective. For example, the G-7 has not followed up on a 1992 agreement to develop a program for coping with the potential disasters posed by aging nuclear power plants in the former Soviet Union. It remains to be seen whether and how the new agreement on a rescue package for Russia will be carried out.
The most organized and visible activity, the annual meetings of the seven heads of government, has evolved into an elaborate photo-op, "offering platitudes," as Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, observed.
America's key partners are likely to resist added responsibilities. The alternative, however, is not the free ride provided by Washington but a breakdown of international order; their self-interest is likely to bring them around. The very fact that they are prepared to rely on the G-7 format to attack problems like the Russian crisis is a good sign.
To fulfill its enormous potential, the the group must change. It needs concrete goals. In the political-security realm, it must continue to help the Russians while working to stabilize the other former Soviet republics. In the economic area, the main goal should be to achieve the concessions necessary for a new global trade agreement.
Over the long term, the agenda should include slowing the spread of nuclear arms technology, managing China's emergence as a world power and dealing with the rise of religious fundamentalism and the collapse of order in the third world.
The G-7 should also be institutionalized. It should meet three or four times a year. This would give the leaders more time for real problem-solving and strengthening the habits of cooperation. Consultations by finance ministers should be complemented by regular meetings of foreign and defense ministers, trade negotiators and environmental heads. A small, permanent secretariat should be created, mainly to insure better preparation for group deliberations and better execution of decisions.
Transforming the G-7 along these lines will not reduce the need for other international organizations, like a better-managed U.N., for crisis management. Nor will it rule out the need for Washington to take unilateral steps from time to time. In the end, however, an upgraded G-7 can set a global agenda and realize it.

HEADLINE: Trade Agreement Will Cost Jobs and Revenue;
The Cleanup Bonanza

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Free Trade's Huge Costs" (Op-Ed, May 2), Jerry Brown mentions the words "environment" and "environmental" half a dozen times without once hinting at the huge opportunities for United States suppliers of environmental technologies and services that the North America Free Trade Agreement represents.
After more than a decade of pollution-based economic growth, Mexico -- like most of Latin America -- plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on environmental cleanup. This is a response to indigenous middle classes fed up with tainted air and water, and a consequence of the growing synergism between less wasteful (less polluting) manufacturing and international competitiveness. 
 The only question is whether the $130 billion-a-year United States environmental cleanup industry will get the lion's share of this export bonanza or, if the continental market that the treaty would bring into being fails to materialize, the Germans and Japanese win the prize.
The environment, as this country's best and brightest business people realize, and Mr. Brown clearly does not, is emerging as the wealth-producing mechanism for American workers and entrepreneurs in the 1990's that autos, computers and military spending were in years past.
Failing to approve the trade agreement would be a giant step toward throwing away our national dominance of the continental green marketplace.

HEADLINE: THE CLINTON TAX BILL;
Something for (or From) Everybody

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
From the top of the income ladder to the bottom, from the big-city professional with a portfolio of tax-free bonds to the single parent on the minimum wage, people would face important changes under provisions of the tax law approved today by a Congressional committee.
The fundamentals of the proposal adopted by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee are easy enough to state. For example, just as the Clinton Administration proposed, it would raise the top income tax rates to nearly 40 percent, and it would expand the tax credit that adds cash to the earnings of many poor workers. 
 But nothing in tax law is ever quite that simple. So to carry out these objectives, Congress finds itself making many detailed decisions that will help, or punish, some people more than others; that will raise, or cost, millions of dollars; and that will steer people toward, or away from, certain types of spending and investment.
For the wealthy, the fine print highlights the inevitable consequences of backing away from the tax-cutting 1980's, when top tax rates came down and tax shelters became scarcer.. Now that the opposite is true, Congress and the Administration are on guard against the resurgence of shelters.
 
Obscure but Important
 For the poor, the fine print illustrates the new Administration's determination to get people off welfare and out of poverty, even if that is done by subsidizing jobs, whether through direct payments that create negative tax rates for the low-income working class or through tax breaks for companies that provide jobs in depressed cities.
Some of the changes have drawn little attention but are considered major precedents by tax specialists.
For example, for the first time President Clinton would give an earned-income tax credit, which is a cash benefit meant to help low-income workers rise above the poverty level, to people without children. Although they could only get a modest credit of a few hundred dollars, the feature could become an important one in a program that has steadily expanded over the years.
And in another change, the earned-income tax credit would be made available to some people who earn as much as $28,000 a year. Such an expansive program is aimed partly at offsetting the effects of possible energy taxes on those with relatively low incomes, a new twist on the anti-poverty measure.
 
Changes at the Top
 At the upper end of the income scale, too, there are important changes being considered, aside from the most obvious one: the increase in the top tax rate.
Especially notable are provisions meant to prevent the wealthy from avoiding income taxes by shifting investment income from ordinary interest, which will be more heavily taxed, to capital gains, which will not.
Under the President's plan, people who earn more than $250,000 would pay the 36 percent top tax rate plus a 10 percent surcharge, for an effective tax rate on ordinary income of 39.6 percent.
That new top tax rate would be 40 percent higher than the tax on long-term capital gains, providing a powerful incentive to shift income into investments that provide capital gains.
So the Clinton proposal includes five complex provisions that would discourage upper-income investors from designing investments tailored to provide capital gains instead of ordinary income.
 
Change on Bond Income
 For example, the wealthy will find that it is no longer safe to buy zero-coupon tax-free bonds at a discount from face value on the assumption that the growth in value as the bond approaches maturity will be taxed as a capital gain, as it is now. From now on, that gain would be treated as ordinary income and taxed accordingly.
And people who borrow money to finance their investments would face a change in rules governing the deductibility of interest on the loans. The point of this change would be to prevent people from using a deduction to obtain a 40-percent tax savings on something that was only taxable at 28 percent.
Under current law, taxpayers who borrow to buy securities can deduct their interest expenses from the taxable amount earned through dividends, interest earnings, and net long-term capital gains.
But under the proposed new rules, an investor usually could not count net long-term capital gains as investment income for purposes of deducting interest expenses.
 
Closing a Loophole
 The proposed rules would also be tightened on claiming capital-gains treatment for the money received when an investor sells shares in a partnership. That would close a loophole involving inventory owned by a partnership that has appreciated in value.
And the proposal would change the tax treatment of preferred stock that is stripped of its dividends and sold at a discount. This device is often used to generate automatic capital gains so that people (or companies) with capital losses can write them off against the gains.
The tax bill's authors are clearly worried that some investors would set up financial transactions that are effectively loans masquerading as capital investments.
For example, a taxpayer might buy 100 shares of stock for $1,000 and at the same time enter into a contract to sell the stock a year later for $1,060. In effect, that is a loan at a 6 percent interest rate, but under current law it would be treated as a capital gain of $60. The Clinton proposal would treat much or even all of the gain as interest and tax it at the ordinary income rate.
The rich have not been alone in coping with complexities in the tax law. A perennial complaint about the earned-income tax credit for the working poor has been its complexity.
 
Searching for Simplicity
 The tax credit varies with income and family size, rising to a peak and then tapering off at higher income levels. Along with the basic credit, the program in recent years has included supplemental grants for people with newborn children and for those who buy health insurance.
In search of simplicity, the supplemental credits would disappear under the proposal endorsed by the House committee today.
Not all the working poor would be gaining equally under the provisions, and the incentive to work -- the main reason for expanding the credit -- would vary according to circumstances.
Indeed, some analysts have noted that the credit, which under the draft bill would be as much as 40 percent, is growing to the point that some people who have been hiding income might be tempted to report it, or even to claim to have earned more than they really did. Eugene Steurle of the Urban Institute has called this prospect "the superterranean economy" -- a twist on the age-old underground economy.
As the tax credit is shaping up, someone earning $12,500 who has one child would get a credit of $1,838 in 1994, and if the child was under 1 year old the credit would be $400 more. But under the new formulas, the same person would get a maximum credit of just $1,820 next year.
By contrast, a person with $6,000 income and one older child would get $1,596 under the new formulas in 1994, compared with $1,380 under the old rules; the payment would go up to $2,062 in 1995.
Notably, somebody who had at least two children and earned $24,000 would have received nothing under the old system. Under the new rules, that person would get $631 in 1994 and $793 in 1985.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 15, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about provisions of tax legislation approved by the House Ways and Means Committee misstated the tax treatment of certain tax-free bonds purchased for less than their face value. The increase in value of such bonds as they approach maturity is usually free of taxes. But under current law in some cases -- including those in which bonds were purchased for less than the original offering price -- part of the gain from the sale is taxed as a capital gain. Under the proposed legislation, that part would be taxed as ordinary income.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Tax Bill: A Work in Progress"
 
Highlights of the President's tax proposals, and adjustments approved yesterday by the House Ways and Means Committee. Items markek with an asterisk (*) were changed by the committee from the President's original budget, proposed last month.
 
PERSONAL TAXES
 
INCOME TAX: Under current law, the top tax rate on ordinary income is 31 percent.
 A new top marginal tax rate of 36 percent would be applied to taxable income in excess of $140,000 for married people filing joint returns or more than $115,000 for single people.
The tax on ordinary income, but not on capital gains, would be increased by an additional 10 percent for incomes above $250,000, for an effective top income tax rate of 39.6 percent.
 
CAPITAL GAINS: Under current law, the top tax rate is 28 percent.
This would be unchanged.
SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS: Under current law, half of Social Security benefits earned by retires makeing more than $35,000 (married people) or $25,000 (singles) is taxed.
 Benefits to those people would be taxed at higher rates. They would have to include 85 percent of their Social Security payments as taxable income.
 
EARNED-INCOME TAX CREDIT: Under current law, the credit supplements the wages of low-income workers with children.
The credit would be expanded. By 1995, the credit would equal nearly 40 percent of the earnings of taxpayers with two or more children, up to a maximum credit of $3,460, more than double the maximum credit available this year. The maximum credit would be reduced by about $200 for every $1,000 of earnings in excess of $11,000. For the first time, some people without children would qualify.
 
DIVERSION OF INCOME: To thwart taxpayers who might respond to the higher income tax rates by shifting ordinary income into lower-taxed capital gains, the bill includes provisions that would change the tax treatment of zero-coupon municipal bonds, preferred stock that has been stripped of dividends, and other financial instruments.
 
LUXURY TAXES*: Under current law, there is a special tax on planes, boats, furs and jewelry, but would index the value of cars so that inflation would not push cars into the luxury category over the years.
 
ENERGY TAXES: Under current law, there is no broad-based energy tax. Federal exicse taxes are imposed on many fuels and would be extended.
 
B.T.U. TAX*: The new legislation would tax virtually all forms of energy at a base rate of about 26 cents per million British thermal units, or B.T.U.'s, a measure of energy content. A supplemental tax of about 60 cents per million B. T.U.'s would be put on petroleum products other than home heating oil and liquefied petroleum gases.
 
ELECTRIC UTILITIES*: The tax will be passed on to consumers as a separate line on their electricity bills, insuring that state regulators do not force the utilities to bear the tax.
 
ALUMINUM*: and other industries that use power in electrolytic processes would be exempted from the B.T.U. tax, just as industries that use oil as a feedstock were exempted in the Administration's proposal.
 
FARMERS*: who use gasoline and diesel fuel on the farm would not have to pay the supplemental B.T.U. tax on those fuels. But in exchange, farm interests had to give up the exemption from the tax that the Administration had proposed for ethanol and methanol, which would be taxed at the same rate as petroleum fuels.
 
THE B.T.U. TAX*: will be assessed on imported goods whose value is more than 2 percent attributable to direct energy inputs. That way they will not have a competitive advantage over companies that manufacture comparable products in the United States and have to pay the tax.
 
CORPORATE TAXES
 
LARGE BUSINESSES*: The current top tax rate is 34 percent.
 The new top rate, for companies with profits of more than $10 million, would be 35 percent, not 36 percent as the Administration proposed.
 
SMALL BUSINESSES*: Under current law, businesses can write off not more than $10,000 in equipment.
 They would be allowed to write off in one year, rather than several, the cost of equipment up to $25,000.
 
INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT*: was eliminated.
 
BUSINESS DEDUCTIONS: Under current law, 80 percent of the cost of meals and entertainment is deductible. Now half of those expenses would be deductible. Companies could not deduct executives; salaries above $1 million.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Reaches Its High Mark Since Late '91

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
A gale of commodity market wagering and a puff of inflation swept gold prices yesterday to the highest levels since late 1991.
Gold rose $7.50 an ounce to $369.30 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Open interest in call options, which allow buyers to multiply their gains from a rise in gold prices, vaulted to a record. 
 Traders pointed to activity by Sir James Goldsmith, the European financier, as the main impetus behind the price rise. Sir James has been a major purchaser of the call options that expire today, which give him the right to buy gold for delivery in June at prices below current levels. Those who wrote, or sold, June options would have to buy gold at any price today to settle with Sir James or other option holders.
Some strategists said that Paul Tudor Jones, a leading American trader, and perhaps also the Sultan of Brunei, were busy in the gold market.
"It's been a wild and crazy day," said Ian MacDonald, precious-metals marketing manager for Credit Suisse in New York. "The options dealers had to do a lot of scrambling."
Many dealers and some investment funds have been routinely selling call options, giving buyers the right to purchase gold at fixed but higher prices by a certain deadline. As long as gold prices were depressed, the options expired worthless and the dealers pocketed the extra income from the option sales. But a burst of activity, and surges in prices, in the last two months have left these dealers with large losses, analysts said.
The most precious commodity now seems to be any insight into what Sir James will do today.
"If he holds and takes delivery, we could go higher," said Alan Posnick, who runs precious-metals operations at MTB Bank. "If he liquidates, I don't know where, on the way down, the market stops."
Sir James bought gold options last month with several hundred million dollars in proceeds from selling a 10 percent stake in Newmont Mining to George Soros, another formidable money manager and speculator.
It was unclear whether Sir James had followed the same course with $287 million he made this week from selling a further 9.5 percent interest to three investment banks. Although some of his options expire today, any sudden liquidation might hurt the value of his other options, which extend for several months.
Attempts to reach Sir James and officials of Brunei were unsuccessful. A spokesman for Mr. Jones had no comment.
Mr. Posnick said that commodity-market machinations were shaking the market much harder than any inflation figures. But some evidence of inflation's return, other analysts said, has made it that much easier for big speculators to set off a stampede.
 
Inflation and China Factors
 The markets were confronted yesterday with news that consumer prices had risen four-tenths of 1 percent in April, about twice as much as expected, following Wednesday's report that producer prices had bounded higher. Gold is a classic refuge from inflation, and thus gains in price on the fear of revived inflation.
Heavy gold investments by China, which last year surpassed the United States as the world's largest buyer, have contributed, as well, to gold's rise from an eight-year low of $326.90 in March.
Yesterday, Commodity Exchange prices reached an intra-day peak of $373 yesterday before pulling back late in the session.
Comex officials estimated the day's volume at 100,000 contracts, each for delivery of 100 ounces -- about twice last year's average volume. The total of open interest in call options, those not offset by any other investments, reached 131,093 yesterday, breaking the record of 130,117 set on Sept. 13, 1990.
Gold stocks, usually more volatile than the metal, were mixed. Echo Bay Mines gained 75 cents, to $11.125, but Newmont fell 50 cents, to close at $50.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Oil Prices Fall
 By Reuters
Oil prices dropped below $20 a barrel yesterday because of strong refinery output and a demand by Kuwait for a higher production quota from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, crude oil for delivery in June fell 42 cents, to $19.78 a barrel; June heating oil fell 1.11 cents, to 54.03 cents a gallon, and June unleaded gasoline dropped 1.29 cents, to 59.34 cents a gallon. natural gas firmed, rising 5.6 cents, to $2.271 for a million British thermal units.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 19, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about the surge in gold prices misstated the day on which a record was set for "open interest" in call options on gold futures -- that is, for the number of such options that were not exercised, not closed out and not allowed to expire. The record, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, was set last Wednesday, not Thursday.

HEADLINE: Dying Nebraska Town Finds New Hope in Outcast Doctor

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARGENT, Neb.

 BODY:
In the America of shopping malls, cul-de-sacs and home-delivered pizza, Dr. Bernardo G. Bilang would hardly be the first choice of a family looking for a doctor. As a result of questionable medical procedures, he has been forced to surrender his right to practice in one state and has agreed never again to deliver babies in another.
And in February he was arrested on Federal bank fraud charges. 
 But choice is a luxury unfamiliar to far-flung little towns like Sargent, where the train no longer stops and abandoned farmhouses creak in the wind. The townspeople regard Dr. Bilang as a savior, the only general practitioner who was willing to settle here in the middle of Nebraska.
 
Seeking Another Chance
 It was Dr. Bilang who saved an elderly man with emphysema when he came into the Sargent hospital's emergency room not long ago, gasping for air. People here say the man would not have survived the hour's drive to the doctor in Broken Bow.
Nonetheless, the state's hospital board has denied a permanent license to Dr. Bilang, who had been practicing on a three-month permit since arriving here in January. A ruling on an appeal is expected soon.
Without a doctor, the Sargent hospital would probably have to close, so this town of 710 people has mounted a petition drive to persuade the board to reverse its decision and give the Dr. Bilang, and the town, another chance.
"We're not asking for some fancy doctor," Bill Gumb said as he threw down his cards in a tavern game with three other men in overalls. "What's going to happen when a farmer gets hurt in the field, or a kid gets hit on a bicycle, or an old person has a heart attack?"
Hidden away in the hilly countryside here in the heart of Nebraska, nearly 80 miles from an interstate highway, Sargent has seen its population fade by 50 percent in the last half-century. On its gap-toothed Main Street, the Harvest Baptist Church and Forget Me Not craft shop sit among boarded storefronts. High school graduation ceremonies are tearful farewells to young people who will move far away to find jobs.
Dr. Bilang, a soft-spoken 60-year-old immigrant from the Philippines, where he received his medical training, has become a popular figure here in cowboy-hat country. Even now, after all the accusations of wrongdoing have become public, people drop by his house on Custer Street to buoy his spirits, mow his lawn, ask if he'd like to take a drive in the countryside.
His problems date to 1986, when he was put on probation in Florida for prescribing drugs to a patient without first ordering the required tests. Two years later, he surrendered his Florida medical license after state regulators said he had improperly documented the treatment of a woman who had died in his care.
 
'Restricted in Kansas
 He later moved to a small town in Kansas, where an investigation was ordered after his use of forceps during a birth resulted in an infant's suffering partial facial paralysis, nerve damage and bleeding in the brain. On Dec. 14 Dr. Bilang signed a stipulation agreeing never again to practice obstetrics in Kansas.
"The mistakes weren't so bad that he couldn't learn from them," said Jean Piper, the 51-year-old hospital administrator, who began work here 27 years ago as a nurse's aide.
In February, the doctor was arrested in his office here by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges of bank fraud. Prosecutors say he lied about his income to get loans totaling $75,000 from banks in Florida and Utah. He later defaulted on the debts. Dr. Bilang has said his income dropped when he lost a job.
But in this farming community, which was hit by a rash of foreclosures in the 1980's, nobody is about to side with the banks.
"Around here, if the price of cattle drops $20 a head before market and we can't pay our loans, we could all be charged with bank fraud," said Danny Gibbons, a farmer who is vice chairman of the hospital board. When Dr. Bilang was taken by the Federal agents to a hearing in Lincoln, then left without money or a car, the hospital wired him money for food and a motel room. And Mr. Gibbons made the five-hour drive to retrieve him.
If the outpouring of support for Dr. Bilang underscores the desperation for health care here, it also reflects a measure of empathy and the capacity for forgiveness in rural communities.
"When you live in a small town, you don't have any choice but to forgive and forget," said 82-year-old Helen Huss, who has lived in the same house on Main Street here since 1921. "I know my neighbors' faults, and they know mine. You can't hide. You've got to live with each other."
Until the last few years, it was much easier for doctors with checkered medical records to move undetected from one state to another. But in 1990, Congress enacted the National Practitioners Data Bank, which keeps a list of doctors, now numbering about 4,000, who have been disciplined by state medical boards. While the names on the list are not public, they are available to hospitals and medical boards.
 
Unserved in the Heartland
 Since 1979, the number of rural communities without enough doctors has nearly doubled, to about 1,600, according to the Federal Center for Rural Health Policy. About 100 remote counties have no doctors. In Nebraska alone, seven rural hospitals have closed since 1986, and health experts have predicted that 10 to 15 others in the state face a daunting future.
Rural health experts say that most young doctors do not want to live in such an isolated place. Older doctors, meanwhile, do not want the overwhelming workload that comes with being on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. During his short tenure here, Dr. Bilang saw an average of 25 patients a day.
Some little towns offer rewards to anyone who can find a doctor, and a Federal program sends young doctors to rural areas in exchange for paying their student loans. Even so, the waiting list is long.
 
Fulcrum of Town's Economy
 With his fate in the balance, Dr. Bilang sat at his kitchen table the other day, passing the time by playing a chess game against his computer.
"It's beating me," he said.
Dr. Bilang contends that he would would have been vindicated if he had fought the disciplinary actions. But at the time, he said, he was facing dire financial problems, so he decided instead to sign agreements that he would move on. He now believes that was a mistake. He declined to comment on the bank fraud charges.
"I will be very sad if I have to leave here," he said. "They have treated me like royalty."
A man and his 14-year-old son dropped by to mow his lawn. The telephone rang with words of support. One woman told Dr. Bilang she had refused to see another doctor, out of loyalty.
"Oh, I don't think that's a good idea," he told her.
The doctor is the fulcrum of the town's economy. Without him, the hospital will almost certainly close, putting 44 people out of work. The drug store here can scarcely survive without a doctor to write prescriptions. And the future of the 40-bed nursing home would be clouded, since a doctor would not be available in emergencies.
Townspeople with loved ones in the home would face a painful decision: Should their parents or grandparents be kept in a town without a doctor, or transferred to a nursing home many miles away?
Mick Kozeal, the town's mayor and a construction crew foreman, said he would face such a decision with his mother, who has Alzheimer's and lives in the nursing home. Most of the time, she cannot even recognize the faces of her children or grandchildren, he said.
"But there are days when she knows everything," he added. "Those are precious moments. I don't want to lose them."
 
Hugs in the Grandstand
 Before Dr. Bilang arrived, the town had been without a regular doctor for almost six months. The hospital paid $750 a day for temporary doctors, who were usually retired, but the costly service depleted its cash reserves.
The hospital also spent about $40,000 in its search for a new doctor. Townspeople sent donations in $5 and $1 bills. A barbecue was held to raise money for the effort.
Just as some of the townspeople had started to lose hope, word came one Friday night last fall that Dr. Bilang had signed a contract. At the time, almost everyone in town was at the high school football game. The hospital administrator, Ms. Piper, climbed to the top of the grandstands, with tears in her eyes, to announce the good news: "A doctor is coming to Sargent."
At the same time, a boy on the Sargent team broke into the open and ran for a 50-yard touchdown, and as the grandstands erupted in thunderous applause, it was impossible to tell what brought the loudest cheers. But there was a lot of hugging in the grandstands that night.
"You know, we're like a family here," Ms. Piper said. "And we're worried about each other."

HEADLINE: Circling Back to Square One: Fixing the Economy

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
If there was any doubt left about President Clinton's determination to refocus attention on the economy, he dispelled it at his news conference today by twice dismissing questions about homosexuals in the military with terse one-liners that could not possibly make the evening news.
"You know what my position is; I have nothing else to say about it," the President said at one point in a clipped voice. 
 When the network reporter tried to dig further for a sound bite, Mr. Clinton was already scanning the crowd, pointing to someone else he presumably hoped would ask about the economy.
Mr. Clinton's performance was an essential element in the first mid-course correction of this young Presidency. He is trying to go back to basics. Ask him about homosexuals in the military, and he now answers, in effect, "The deficit." Ask him about Bosnia, and he answers, "The deficit." Ask him about helping out Democratic Party special-interest groups, and he answers, "The deficit."
 
An In-House Analysis
 From his road trip to Cleveland on Monday to his speech in New York City on Wednesday to his news conference in the Rose Garden today, the new Clinton strategy is clear: Keep the White House focused on deficit reduction rather than on new spending plans, on American problems rather than on Balkan ones, and on middle-class issues rather than on special interests. Then get the President out of Washington to sell these themes personally.
This course correction grows out of the Administration's own in-house analysis of where it has gone off track in its first few months.
The first problem they are trying to resolve, aides say, is that of conflicting signals on the economy. While the President understood what he meant when he said that the country suffered from "two deficits" -- the budget deficit and the deficit in new spending on job-creating projects -- the public never quite seems to have got it.
That was why the Republicans, with the help of many conservative Democrats, were able to defeat the President's plan first to stimulate the economy with $15.5 billion in new deficit spending before attacking the deficit.
 
Governing and Politics
 There was an economic logic to that stimulus package, but it was not immediately apparent to most Americans how more deficit spending in the short run was going to help deficit cutting in the long run, and the Republicans adroitly used that confusion to paint Mr. Clinton as a tax-and-spend Democrat. While the President is not abandoning his long-term investment ideas, it is his long-term deficit-cutting ideas that he played up last week.
The second change the White House made this week -- one that few people would have predicted that Bill Clinton would ever need to make -- was remembering the connection between governing and politics. Mr. Clinton's staff relentlessly disparaged President George Bush as dropping proposals on Congress and then letting them sit there, never bothering to go out and sell them to the public.
Mr. Bush, they contended, did not understand the seamless connection between governing and politics, between making decisions and then selling them. Mr. Clinton, they boasted, would have a "permanent campaign" to sell his budget ideas. It lasted seven days.
"I think we had about a week's worth of strategy after Feb. 17 to sell this, and what we needed was about three months' worth of strategy," Mr. Clinton said in an interview that appeared in today's Washington Post, when asked about his budget. "I believe this is my fault."
How did such an inveterate politician, such a natural pitchman for his own politics, get diverted? In part it was the pressure of governing -- having to suddenly devise policies to deal with turmoil in Russia and torment in Waco, Tex., while also assembling a budget and health-care plan.
"I'm trying to do hard things, and I can't do hard things and conduct an ongoing campaign at the same time," Mr. Clinton said today at his news conference.
But there also seems to be a tension between the campaigner in Mr. Clinton, who gets energized by selling his ideas to the crowds, and the student of policy, who can endlessly debate policy options.
"I think Clinton got caught up in the excitement of governing during his first 100 days," said Thomas Mann, a Congressional expert at the Brookings Institution, a research group. "He got so involved in indulging his interest in different aspects of policy that he forgot about the politics of selling it. He thought that his policy discussion sessions inside the White House were sufficient.
"But they were not. Not enough was being conveyed to the public about what exactly his Presidency was up to."
In any event, the President's corrective efforts are now clear. Not only is he emphasizing the deficit-reducing elements of his budget, but to prove it he also offered to lock up every bit of new tax revenue and every net spending cut in a trust fund that would be bound by law to be spent exclusively on reducing the deficit.
 
Bought Schumer's Idea
 Clinton aides acknowledge that they simply misread the depth to which the public wanted to be assured that deficit reduction would take precedence over every other economic priority.
Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, who pushed the idea of the deficit-reduction trust fund, said the White House finally bought the idea after enough Congressmen told the President that their constituents were telling them that they were ready to sacrifice, that they were ready to pay more taxes, but only if they had the ironclad assurance that the White House was going to do something about the deficit.
Hence the new Clinton mantra, as he spelled it out today: "Until we can prove that we have the discipline to control our budget, I don't think we'll have the elbow room necessary to have the kind of targeted investments we need. I think the more we do budget control, the more we'll be free to then be very sharply discriminating in investing in those things which actually do create jobs. I don't think we have any other option at this time."

HEADLINE: Clinton Asks Reserve Board Not to Raise Interest Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Seeking to salvage his troubled economic program, President Clinton urged the Federal Reserve Board today not to raise interest rates, at least until there is "more evidence" of rising inflation.
Mr. Clinton's comments came in answer to a question about Federal Reserve policy at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, where he defended his leadership style and asserted that he had taken on tougher challenges than his two immediate predecessors. 
 In an effort to put behind him the weeks of self-examination over his performance as President, Mr. Clinton made a renewed pitch for his economic remedies. They could be jeopardized, he said, if the Reserve reacts to a sharp increase in consumer prices last month by raising interest rates. White House officials say they are concerned that as the Administration moves to raise taxes, higher rates would be a further drag on the economy.
 
Consumer Prices Up 0.4%
 The Consumer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Labor Department reported Thursday, reflecting price increases in most of the goods and services that Americans use every day. The report added to concerns that inflation may be creeping back; the index has been rising at a 4.3 percent annual rate so far this year, well above the rate in 1992.
"There are some clear, underlying reasons for this last inflationary bulge which don't necessarily portend long-term inflation," the President said today. "I think it's, of course, a cause of concern. But we ought to wait until we have some more evidence before we raise interest rates in an economy where industrial capacity is only at 80 percent."
The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, meets eight times a year and has scheduled its next session for Tuesday. The meetings are held in secret and the members never discuss their plans in public. While there has been no clear signal that the Reserve is preparing to increase interest rates, there has been speculation on Wall Street that to combat inflation, the nation's central bank may increase short-term rates to make it more difficult to obtain money.
The Federal Reserve operates independently of the White House, and the President has no control over it except through suasion. Since the election, Mr. Clinton and the Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who is a conservative Republican, have sought to emphasize that they have a cordial relationship. President George Bush frequently criticized Mr. Greenspan's policies.
 
Emphasis on the Deficit
 Mr. Clinton said repeatedly today that he was pleased by the House Ways and Means Committee's approval of his tax-increase proposal on Thursday, and asserted that the emphasis should remain on cutting the deficit.
"The prevailing opinion at the Fed and the prevailing opinion in the economic community has been that the most important thing we can do is bring down long-term interest rates by bringing down the deficit," he said.
Seeking to discourage the new worries about inflation, the President said. "If you look at all the underlying long-term things, long-term trends in energy prices, industrial capacity, the kinds of things that really shape an economy, there is no reason at this time to believe that there could be any cause for resurgent inflation."
Mr. Clinton was alternately relaxed and combative as he fielded questions about his handling of issues at home and abroad, and about polls that show public confidence in his performance declining.
"You know, I'm doing things that are hard, that are controversial," he said. "And anybody who doesn't want to assume responsibility can stand on the sidelines and criticize. I never expected that I could take on some of these interests that I've taken on without being attacked."
 
'Let the Chips Fall'
 Brushing aside his poll ratings, the President said, "My job is to do my job and let the chips fall where they may."
He reacted almost with disbelief when a reporter asked if he had surrounded himself with too many young, inexperienced aides. "You think I ought to let some of them go?" he asked.
And he looked offended when he was asked about Bosnia. Glancing down at the reporters in front of him, Mr. Clinton pointedly suggested that his record on foreign policy compared favorably to that of Mr. Bush.
"I realize it may be frustrating for all of you to deal with the ambiguity of this problem, but it is a difficult one," he said, referring to the Bosnia impasse. "I have a clear policy. I have gotten more done on this than my predecessors did, and maybe one reason he didn't try to do it is because if you can't force everybody to fall in line overnight, the people that have been fighting each other for centuries, you may be accused of vacillating. We're not vacillating. We have a clear, strong policy."
 
Frustrated Over Criticism
 The President said his threat of military intervention and arming the Bosnian Muslims still stands, despite opposition from European allies. "We're just going to keep working and pushing in this direction," he said. "And I think we'll begin to get more and more results."
Turning to defend his performance on domestic matters before abruptly ending the 40-minute news conference, Mr. Clinton expressed his own frustration over the criticism. "One day people say, 'He's trying to do too much, he's pushing too hard, he wants too much change,' " Mr. Clinton said. "And then on the other day say, 'Well, he's really not pushing very hard.' I think we're getting good results."
As his own political strategists travel to Texas in an effort to help Senator Bob Krueger, a Democrat who faces a difficult special election next month, the President indicated that he would not campaign on behalf of Mr. Krueger.
"I've always been skeptical about the question of whether any of us can have any impact on anyone else's races," he said.
For his part, Mr. Krueger has distanced himself from the President, particularly on the economic plan that the Republicans killed last month.
When pressed about simply accepting the loss of a Democratic seat in the Senate, Mr. Clinton responded: "I'm not resigned to losing it. I think Bob Krueger can still win the race. But it depends on -- as with all cases -- it depends on how he frames the issues, how his opponent frames the issues, and what happens there."
 
Defends Civil Rights Nominee
 Mr. Clinton offered a vigorous defense of Lani Guinier, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is his nominee to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. Her writings on race relations have been attacked by conservatives as divisive. In any event, he said, Congress and not his Administration would set civil rights policy.
"I nominated her because there had never been a full-time practicing civil rights lawyer with a career in civil rights law heading the civil rights division," he said. "I expect the policy to be made on civil rights laws by the United States Congress, and I expect the Justice Department to carry out that policy."
Asked about Webster Hubbell, his nominee for Associate Attorney General, the President said Mr. Hubbell should not be disqualified because of his membership in a predominantly white country club in Little Rock, Ark. He said Mr. Hubbell had tried for years to integrate the club.
Mr. Clinton refused to answer questions about his efforts to overturn the ban on homosexuals in the military. But he said that he had watched "quite a lot" of the testimony this week at Senate hearings on the matter, and that it was "quite moving and straightforward."

HEADLINE: MOYNIHAN EXPECTS TAX BILL SUCCESS

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Republicans will provide no votes for President Clinton's tax bill when the Senate Finance Committee considers the measure next month, but the committee chairman said Democrats would manage to produce a bill anyway.
"Don't worry, your taxes will be raised," the chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, told reporters today with a laugh. Mr. Moynihan, a New York Democrat, and said that in the end all 11 Democrats on the committee would back the bill while all nine Republicans would oppose it. 
 The Senator said he had been told by Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the committee, that "there will not be any Republican support for the tax bill."
A spokesman for Senator Packwood confirmed that statement, saying the bill approved Thursday by the House Ways and Means Committee -- a measure to raise almost $250 billion in taxes over the next five years -- had no support from the Republicans.
 
Minimum of Partisanship
 Nonetheless, Mr. Moynihan noted, the Finance Committee has historically been one of the less partisan committees in the Senate, usually getting significant minority support for bills that the majority favors. Indeed, Mr. Moynihan played a major role in a triumph for Mr. Packwood in 1986, when the Republican was chairman of the committee, supporting him in a successful effort to eliminate many tax loopholes.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who is Senator Moynihan's predecessor as chairman of the committee, also predicted success for President Clinton's tax package today. But he said it would probably undergo some changes to satisfy all the Democrats on the panel. "Every Congress makes some changes and this one will be no exception," Mr. Bentsen told reporters at the White House.
Both Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Bentsen offered similar rationales for their predictions. "Bringing the deficit down is our most important economic responsibility," Mr. Bentsen said.
Senator Moynihan asserted, "The only political business that will be transacted in the last decade of the 20th century will be to lift the paralysis" of ever-increasing deficits.
Mr. Moynihan made it plain that he had no enthusiasm for some elements of the bill.
 
Restaurants and Cattle
 For example, reducing the deductibility of meals and other forms of business entertainment from 80 percent to 50 percent would injure the restaurant business in New York, he said. "I'm going to be for the President's bill," he added. "Will it hurt? You're darn right it will."
Senator Moynihan said he was willing to support measures that pinched some constituents at home if fellow Democrats showed a comparable spirit of sacrifice. "I try to remind my friends who have cattle that we have restaurants," he said.
He noted that the bill no longer includes a temporary investment tax credit opposed by him as well as by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But Mr. Moynihan said their doubts about it did not translate into opposition to Mr. Clinton. "The President ended up not wanting it that much," Mr. Moynihan said.
In all, the Senator said, "there is no pleasure in this," adding, "We're just trying to raise some money to keep the deficit from going higher." And that was essential, he said, because "your country is on the verge of instability."

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 14

 BODY:
At a tumultuous meeting marked by insults, accusations and angry walkouts, three Serbian legislatures endorsed an international peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina today and urged the Bosnian Serbs to sign it.
But a boycott of the meeting by Serbs from both Bosnia and Croatia raised questions whether the endorsement would have any effect. Bosnian Serb leaders, who have already rejected the plan three times, said they would ignore the resolution and proceed with a referendum this weekend that is expected to produce a resounding vote against the plan. 
 In another effort to get the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan, Belgrade announced an embargo of goods other than food and medicine. [United States intelligence reports said today that truck traffic into Bosnia has declined, but that fuel tankers and other vehicles are still entering Bosnia.]
 
Meeting Called by Serbia
 The meeting today had been called by Serbian leaders in Belgrade to press their Serbian comrades in Bosnia and Herzegovina to end the 13-month war and accept the peace plan put forward by Cyrus R. Vance, the former United Nations mediator on the Balkans, and Lord Owen, the European Community representative.
"We support the peace plan for Bosnia as the only solution offered by the international community for the cessation of hostilities," said the resolution adopted by legislators from the Yugoslav Federation and its two component republics, Serbia and Montenegro. "We call on the Serbian people in Bosnia to accept the peace plan and continue their struggle for national independence through negotiations."
The Bosnian Serbs refused to attend today's meeting. Their self-styled parliament voted to reject the peace plan at a special meeting on May 5 and called for a referendum of all Bosnian Serbs to be held this weekend on the issue.
In a televised interview from the Bosnian town of Pale, the Bosnian Serbs' leader, Radovan Karadzic, predicted that Bosnian Serbs would reject the plan in this weekend's vote because it would mean "pushing the Serbian people into misery and into disaster."
"We realize that now we are completely alone and that only God is with us, although we are defending Christianity against militant Muslim fundamentalism," Dr. Karadzic said.
 
Hopes of Easing Sanctions
 More than 200 representatives of the self-declared Serbian republic in the Krajina region of Croatia also boycotted the meeting today in Belgrade, and 139 members of the Radical Party, the most ardently nationalist legislative bloc in Serbia, stalked out in protest.
The no-shows and walkouts undercut the authority of the assembly, which had been summoned by the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, in an effort to override the Bosnian Serb parliament's rejection of the peace plan.
Mr. Milosevic, who was the principal sponsor and arms supplier of the Bosnian Serbs, has pushed for acceptance of the plan in an effort to get the United Nations to lift economic sanctions that are wrecking the Yugoslav economy.
If all the Serbian legislators had accepted the invitation, today's assembly would have brought together as many as 680 delegates, most of them controlled by Mr. Milosevic and able to outvote the 82 Bosnian Serbs and others opposed to the peace plan.
But by the time the vote was cast, the chamber held only slightly more than 200 delegates, less than a third of those who had been invited. A handful of Serbs from Bosnia and Krajina attended, but only as observers, and the leader of the militant Radical Party, Vojislav Seselj, led his delegates out of the hall before the vote.
"It is impossible to pass a resolution while the Bosnian Serbs are not present," he said later.
At a rally Thursday, Mr. Seselj threatened to launch missiles against Italy if Rome allowed Italian bases to be used for planes participating in future bombing of Bosnian Serb positions. Italian officials responded by ordering tighter security around their bases, but Italy's Foreign Minister, Beniamino Andreatta, dismissed Mr. Seselj's party as "a lunatic group."
The session today was held in Belgrade's luxurious Sava Center, which in better days was an international convention complex but now is used only for occasional local events.
 
Arguing Rules of Debate
 More time was devoted to arguing about rules of debate than was spent discussing the peace plan, and delegates spent much of the session hurling accusations at each other. One was denounced for allegedly enriching himself through illegal lumber exports. Another was said to have "a dual personality" because his mother is of Croatian descent.
The leader of the self-styled Bosnian Serb assembly, Momcilo Krajisnik, dismissed the action in Belgrade today.
"This parliament has not contributed anything important to the whole situation," Mr. Krajisnik said, "especially since a large number of delegates walked out."
The assembly vote and the Bosnian Serbs' defiant reaction underlined the ostensible gulf that has emerged in recent days between Serbia and Serbs in Bosnia.
Bosnian Serb leaders are convinced that the Vance-Owen peace plan would destroy their hopes for making an independent country out of the lands won by Serbs in 13 months of fighting. The Serbian leadership in Belgrade is urging them to sign the plan, stop fighting, and then present their complaints at a conference table, though many, especially the Bosnian Muslims, suspect that Belgrade is merely trying to reduce the sanctions before resuming overt support for the Serbian nationalists in Bosnia. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Truck Traffic Slows
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Special to The New York Times) -- The flow of truck traffic carrying fuel and other goods into Bosnia from Serbia has declined in recent days, but fuel tankers and other vehicles are continuing to make their way into the country, Government officials said today.
The officials said an assessment by United States intelligence agencies reported that it was unclear how much cargo is being carried in the continuing shipments. But they said a vast network of secondary roads allowed trucks to enter Bosnia without being subjected to the new border checks ordered by Belgrade.
The assessment speculates that Mr. Milosevic, the Serbian leader, will do "the minimum necessary" to persuade Western governments that he is enforcing the blockade on all but food and other relief that he ordered last week. But while it cautioned that its judgment remained preliminary, it described actual enforcement of the embargo as no more than sporadic.
Among the biggest loopholes in the blockade, the Government officials said, is a provision that allows Serbian trucks to carry goods across Bosnia to reach Krajina, a Serbian region of Croatia. They said there is little provision for insuring that fuel and other goods are not delivered to Serbs in Bosnia instead.
 
Balkan Update
 In BELGRADE, Serbian legislators unanimously endorsed an international peace plan, but Bosnian Serb leaders said that they would ignore the resolution.
Serbian militia members attacked Muslims near the northeastern town of BRCKO.
Officials also reported clashes between Muslims and Croats in MOSTAR and VITEZ. The Croats opened a detention camp near Mostar to reporters.
At the UNITED NATIONS, the Security Council planned a rare meeting of foreign ministers to review progress toward peace in Bosnia; and France called on the United States and Russia to send troops to help protect SARAJEVO, SREBRENICA, TUZLA, BIHAC, ZEPA and GORAZDE.
In WASHINGTON, President Clinton reiterated his proposals on Bosnia, but said America will not send troops to support one side in the conflict.
BULGARIA said it will enforce tighter sanctions against Yugoslavia, but American officials said supplies are still getting to the Bosnian Serbs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Industry's Sluggish Pace

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
People have been worrying for years that America's industrial base, if not shrinking outright, has at the very least been expanding quite slowly.
Yesterday, in a routine monthly report on industrial production, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial capacity during the last five years has indeed been growing more slowly than previously thought -- at an average of just 1.7 percent a year, not 2.4 percent as Fed figures had previously shown. That is half the pace of the early 1980's. 
 Productivity capacity in factories, mines and utilities is about 4 percent lower than the Fed had previously reported, the revised index of capacity showed.
 
Gauging the Cutbacks
 The new figures seem to support two kinds of concerns: one was that plant closings and cutbacks have taken a bigger bite out of productive capacity than had been realized.
"The Fed is validating the notion that there may be have been a hollowing out of Smokestack America in the 1980's," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley. "These companies were aggressive at plant closings because they thought they needed to cut out the fat to survive. The risk is that they may have gone a little too far."
The second concern has been that sluggish investment has added insufficiently to the productive base.
 
One Official's Worry
 "Secretary Reich has been saying that we have an investment deficit," said Lawrence F. Katz, chief economist of the Labor Department, speaking of Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary. "These numbers reinforce that message."
The Fed's revisions are based on more comprehensive data it obtained from the 1992 census of manufacturers, a survey taken every five years. The Fed revises its production, utilitization and capacity data every few years. The last revision was in April 1990.
Yesterday's report also showed that manufacturing output in April was expanding at a decent clip -- increasing four-tenths of 1 percent -- and that the 1991-92 recession in manufacturing was less severe than initially believed and the recovery so far a bit stronger. Overall industrial production, including utilities, rose one-tenth of 1 percent.
The emerging picture is that the economy is much closer to production limits than the Federal Reserve had believed, a situation that could result in bottlenecks and higher prices, unless business invests at a faster clip.
"The size of the recession has been reduced significantly," said Steven Strongin, vice president, economic policy and research at the Chicago Federal Reserve.
What some economists found stunning was the Fed's estimate that the factory utilization rate in April, 81.4 percent, which is roughly the long-run average, was unexpectedly high for an economy that is only two years into a relatively modest recovery. The factory utilization rate in March was 79.9 percent.
"All of a sudden, there is less running room than we thought," said David Kelly of the Boston Company Economic Advisers. "Assuming that the economy resumes reasonable growth in the second half, you could easily be in the mid-80's by early 1994, a zone typically associated with the ability to jack up prices."
Because these figures present another sign that the economy might be a little stronger than people had thought, it could make President Clinton's job bill a more difficult sell.
Still, tighter capacity could be a positive sign for companies that supply capital goods, from computers to electrical generators. Capacity utilization of about 81.9 percent usually represents territory associated with stronger investment.
David Wyss, an economist at Data Resources Inc., noted that the report showed more capacity shrinkage among military suppliers than previously estimated. This suggests that the painful process of cutting back the arms industry may be further along than people thought.
"It suggests we're farther into that adjustment process," he said. "Companies haven't just been sitting back waiting for their orders to disappear. They actually thought about this ahead of time, and took action."
To be sure, economists say, capacity figures are hardly exact, and the shift to flexible manufacturing may allow manufacturers to use what capacity they have better. Furthermore, there is still plenty of spare capacity in other industrial countries, including Canada, and those nations would be only too happy to increase their imports to the United States.
 
Broad-Based Changes
 Despite these caveats, economists view capacity utilization as an important indicator. A Fed economist, who said he would not speak for attribution, noted that the downward revisions of capacity were broad based and not confined to a couple of industries. "A lot of the changes are not dramatic," he said, "but there are so many of them that they add up."
The Fed's revisions are sure to raise questions again about the reliability of Government statistics -- especially at a time when inflation looks slightly more worrisome and growth looks less than satisfactory. Such statistics are widely followed not only by business executives and investors, but also by the Federal Reserve and other agencies as they make policy decisions.
And these revisions come on the heels of a report in The Washington Post that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is about to release a revision of data, this time showing that it overstated job losses during the recession and undercounted the number of new jobs created so far in the recovery. The Post's report has been confirmed by the Labor Department.
 
Altering the Recession Data
 The Federal Reserve also revised its estimates of industrial production back to 1987 yesterday. While the new data show that production grew less before the end of the 1980's expansion than had previously been thought, they also show that the recession in industry was milder than previously thought.
Production fell just 4 percent, not 5.1 percent, from its pre-recession peak in September 1990 to its recession trough in March 1991. And the subsequent recovery in industrial production has been a bit stronger, up 7.3 percent from March 1991, rather than the original estimate of 6.7 percent
Reports yesterday also shed light on the recent state of the economy.
The Commerce Department reported that business inventories rose at their fastest rate in nearly three years in March, jumping eight-tenths of 1 percent and pushing up the inventory-sales ratio a tad, while sales edged up only two-tenths of 1 percent. The department has, however, already reported that retail sales rebounded 1.2 percent in April.
 
A Rebound in Output
 The Federal Reserve's report yesterday showed that factory output rose four-tenths of 1 percent in April, suggesting that the manufacturing sector seems to be recovering reasonably well from the big inventory pileup in March.
Overall industrial production was flat in April, rising only one-tenth of 1 percent, because it had been drawn down by a sharp 3.6 percent drop in utility output that occurred when the weather turned warmer.
"It's a decent performance, all things considered," Mr. Wyss said. "It's certainly not a runaway recovery, it's still half speed, but at least it's a recovery.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Clinton's News Conference in the Rose Garden

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday in the Rose Garden at the White House, as transcribed by Reuters.
 
OPENING STATEMENT

Three months ago, I presented a plan to our country and to the Congress designed to address what I believe are the significant challenges of this time. For more than 40 years our country was organized to stand up against Communism, to try to help develop the free world, and for most of that time we took our economic prosperity for granted. 
 It is now clear that at the end of the cold war we must organize ourselves around the obligation we have to be more competitive in the global economy and to enable our people to live up to their full potential.
That means we have to do a lot of things to turn this economy around, beginning with a serious effort to reduce our national debt, to invest in jobs and new technologies, to restore fairness to our tax code and to make our political system work again.
This week I was able to go back again to the American people, to take my case into the country, and to Cleveland and Chicago and New York, and here, in Washington, there were new efforts to break the gridlock and to put the national interest above narrow interests.
The results were particularly impressive in the work done by the House Ways and Means Committee. Achieving over $250 billion in deficit reduction through spending cuts with two dollars in spending cuts for each dollar in new investment in jobs and education, the program provides significantly everything that I presented to the Congress, even though there were some changes. In fact, some of the changes I think made the bill better.
Let me reiterate them. No. 1, significant deficit reduction. No. 2, taking on entitlements issues that have for too long been left on the table. No. 3, real investments for small businesses, and for big businesses, incentives to get people to invest money in this economy to create jobs.
And perhaps most importantly, a break for working-class families, a huge increase in the earned-income tax credit for people with incomes under $30,000, to relieve them of the impact of the energy tax and to say for the first time, people who work 40 hours a week with children in the home would be lifted above poverty.
And finally, of course, the plan was very progressive, 75 percent of the revenues coming from the top 6 percent of the American taxpayers.
I also reiterated that I don't want a penny in taxes without the spending cuts, and I proposed in New York that we create a deficit-reduction trust fund into which all the taxes and all the budget cuts could be put and kept for the five-year life of this budget.
This is a very important thing. I realize some have said it is little more than a gimmick, but the truth is there is no legal protection now for the life of the budget for these funds. This will provide it, in stone, in law.
In every element of this there has been some willingness on the part of those who have supported our efforts to take on powerful vested interests in behalf of the national interest, whether it is in repealing the lobby deduction, or in going for a direct loan program for college loans that will save $4 billion, but which will remove a Government-guaranteed income from several interests who like the system as it is now.
The Congress also moved this week to reinvigorate our democratic process by ending the filibuster and passing the motor voter bill.
These are the kinds of changes that the American people expect of us. They do not expect miracles, but they expect solid, steady progress, and I am determined to stay on this course. It has been a good week, and if we are willing to take more tough decisions, there will be more good weeks for the American people ahead.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
U.S. Role in Bosnia

Q. Mr. President, you've said that the United States will not go it alone with military action in Bosnia, and yet the European allies have refused to sign on to your proposals. If the allies refuse to follow suit, where does that leave the United States?
A. Let me reiterate what I have said because I think that the United States has taken the right position, and I think that we've gotten some good results. I have said, and I will reiterate, I think that the United States must act with our allies, especially because Bosnia is in the heart of Europe, and the Europeans are there. We must work together through the United Nations.
Secondly, I do not believe the United States has any business sending troops there to get involved in a conflict in behalf of one of the sides. I believe that we should continue to turn up the pressure, and as you know, I have taken the position that the best way to do that would be to lift the arms embargo with a standby authority of air power in the event that the present situation was interrupted by the unfair use of artillery by the Bosnian Serbs.
That position is still on the table. It has not been rejected out of hand. Indeed, some of our European allies have agreed with it and others are not prepared to go that far yet. But we have to keep the pressure up.
And I would just remind you that since we said we would become involved in the Vance-Owen peace process, two of the three parties have signed on, we've gotten enforcement of the no-fly zone through the United Nations, we've been able to airlift more humanitarian supplies there, and we've been able to keep up a very, very tough embargo on Serbia, which I think led directly, that and the pressure of further action, to the statement that Mr. Milosevic made to the effect that he would stop supporting the Bosnian Serbs.
Where we go from here is to keep pushing in the right direction. As we speak here, the United Nations is considering a resolution which would enable us to place United Nations forces along the border between Serbia and Bosnia, to try to test and reinforce the resolve of the Milosevic government to cut off supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
If that resolution passes, and in its particulars it makes good sense, that is a very good next step. We're just going to keep working and pushing in this direction, and I think we'll begin to get more and more results.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, there's a widespread perception that you're waffling, that you can't make up your mind. One day you're saying, in a few days, we'll have a decision, we have a common approach. The next day, you're saying, we're still looking for a consensus.
Will American troops be in this border patrol that the U.N. is voting on? And you know, where are we?
A. Well, first of all, I have made up my mind and I've told you what my position was and I made it as clear as I can. But I also believe it is imperative that we work with our allies on this. The United States is not in a position to move unilaterally, nor should we. So that is the answer to your question.
 The resolution being considered by the United Nations, I think, contemplates that the Unprofor [United Nations Protective Force] forces would be moved and expanded and moved to the border. At this time, there has been no suggestion that we would be asked to be part of those forces.
 
Military's Gay Ban
 Q. A domestic question. Could you tell us, how were you affected by the testimony of Col. Fred Peck, whose son is a homosexual, who said that nonetheless he could not in good conscience support lifting the ban?
A. I thought all the testimony given in that hearing, and I saw quite a lot of it from more than one panel, was quite moving and straightforward. I still think the test ought to be conduct.
Q. Do you think that -- do you -- does this allow for the possibility of the "don't ask, don't tell," the compromise that would allow ----
A. You know what my position is. I have nothing else to say about it.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Civil Rights Appointment
 Q. Your nominee to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division [Lani Guinier] has expressed what many regard as rather striking views about voting rights and a number of other areas, including expressing some misgivings about the principle of one man, one vote. And I wonder if you are familiar with all these views and if you support them, and if you do not, why you chose her?
A. I nominated her because there had never been a full-time practicing civil rights lawyer with a career in civil rights law heading the Civil Rights Division. I expect a policy to be made on civil rights laws by the United States Congress, and I expect the Justice Department to carry out that policy.
Insofar as there is discretion in the policy, that discretionary authority should reside either in the president or the attorney general, in terms of what policies the country will follow. I still think she's a very well-qualified civil rights lawyer, and I hope she'll be confirmed, and I think she has every intention of following the law of the land as Congress writes it.

 Q. Mr. President, what would you say or what do you say to Federal Reserve officials who are arguing for a slight rise in short-term interest rates because they're concerned about resurging inflation?
A. I would say that the month before last, we had virtually no inflation, and you can't run the country on a month-to-month basis. You've got to look at some longer trends. There are some clear underlying reasons for this last inflationary bulge, which don't necessarily portend long-term inflation. I think it's, of course, a cause of concern, we ought to look at it, but we ought to wait till we have some more evidence before we raise interest rates in an economy where industrial capacity is only at 80 percent.
If you look at all the underlying long-term things -- long-term trends in energy prices, industrial capacity, the kinds of things that really shape an economy -- there is no reason at this time to believe that there could be any cause for a resurgent inflation.
Q. The argument is made at the Federal Reserve that higher taxes, higher burdens on business through health care fees or other things like that will indeed raise inflation while the economy stays weak.
A. Well, just a few weeks ago some people were arguing that all this would be deflationary and would repress the recovery. So I guess you can find an expert to argue any opinion, but there is no evidence of that.
The prevailing opinion at the Fed and the prevailing opinion in the economic community has been that the most important thing we can do is to bring down long-term interest rates by bringing down the deficit. You can't have it both ways. We're either going to bring down the deficit or we're not. And everything in life requires some rigorous effort if you're going to have fundamental change.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Opinion Polls
 Q. Mr. President, in your opening statement you said this has been a good week for you, but the latest CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, as you probably saw, shows a 10 percent decline in your job-approval rating since the end of April, from 55 to 45 percent.
Why do you think that's happening? And is it your fault, or what can be done?
A. Well, for one thing, I'm trying to do hard things, and I can't do hard things, and conduct an ongoing campaign at the same time.
You know, I'm doing things that are hard, that are controversial, and anybody who doesn't want to assume responsibility can stand on the sidelines and criticize them. I never expected that I could actually do anything about the deficit without having some hits.
I never expected that I could take on some of these interests that I've taken on without being attacked. And whenever you try to change things, there are always people there ready to point out the pain of change without the promise of it, and that's just all part of it.
If I worried about the poll ratings I'd never get anything done here. My only -- the only thing I'd remind you is, for 12 years we've seen politicians in the Congress and the executive branch worry about their poll ratings every month, and then at the end of every four years things are a lot worse.
If things are better at the end of the period that I was given to serve, then the poll ratings now won't make any difference, and if they're not, they won't make any difference. So my job is to do my job and let the chips fall where they may. Yes?
<Hb>Warring in Balkans
 Q. There seems to be a Catch-22 emerging on Bosnia. One would be that you have consistently said that you want to have a consensus with the U.S. allies, but until that consensus is formed, you've found that it seems very difficult to explain to the American people precisely how that war should be defined. Is it a civil war? Is it a war of aggression? And also not necessarily what the next step should be, but what are the principles, the overriding principles that should guide U.S. policy?
What can you tell the American people right now about that?
A. First, that it is both a civil war and a war of aggression. Because Bosnia was created as a separate legal entity, it is both a civil war, where elements of people who live within that territory are fighting against one another, and there has been aggression from without -- from the Croatians and from the Serbs, principally from the Serbs. That the inevitable but unintended impact of the arms embargo has been to put the United Nations in the position of ratifying an enormous superiority of arms for the Bosnian Serbs that they got from Serbia. And that our interest is in seeing, in my view at least, that the United Nations does not fore-ordain the outcome of a civil war. That's why I've always been in favor of some kind of lifting of the arms embargo -- that we contain the conflict and that we do everything we can to move to an end of it and to move to an end of ethnic cleansing.
Those are our interests there, and those are the ones I'm trying to pursue, but we should not introduce American ground forces into the conflict in behalf of one of the belligerents, and we must move with our allies.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Youth in the White House
 Q. Mr. President, one of the charges leveled by critics of you in Arkansas and now at the beginning of your term as President is that you've surrounded yourself with too many young people and put them in too many senior positions. How do you respond to that criticism?
A. Like Lloyd Bentsen and Warren Christopher?
I mean, who are you referring to? Mr. McLarty, Mr. Ruin, Ms. Rasco and Mr. Lake, to name four, and I, are all I think older than our counterparts were when President Kennedy was President.
There are a lot of young people who work here but most of the people in decision-making positions are not particularly young. And I'm amazed sometimes that, you know -- you think I ought to let some of them go? 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Cutting the Deficit
 Q. Mr. President, you've been talking a lot recently about deficit reduction, the deficit reduction trust fund. You're talking now about having to stretch out your investment programs, postpone some of the things. What do you say to people in urban areas, some of the liberal congressmen on the Hill, who say, wait a minute, we're the ones who elected this guy and now the programs that have been starved for 12 years that we need aren't going to be able to get money? What sort of political position does that put you in with your core supporters?
A. Well, I ask them, first of all, to look at the five-year budget. The enormous squeeze on domestic spending, including investment spending, began 12 years ago. I can't turn it around overnight. And I ask them to look at the five-year budget and look at in light of the fact that the deficit numbers were revised upward after the election by $50 billion a year in three of the next four years.
And I ask them also to consider this: until we can prove that we have the discipline to control our budget, I don't think we'll have the elbow room necessary to have the kind of targeted investments we need. I think the more we do budget control, the more we'll be free to then be very sharply discriminating in those things which actually do create jobs. I don't think we have any other option at this time.
 
Crisis of Hope
 Q. Mr. President, in your New York speech this past week at Cooper Union, you spoke of a crisis of belief and hope, and earlier Mrs. Clinton in a speech talked about a crisis of meaning. How do you see these crises manifesting themselves, what are the causes of them, and how severe do you see this?
A. Well, I think they manifested themselves in people's honest feelings that things are not going very well in this country and that they haven't gone very well in a long time, in the alienation people feel from the political process, and in the alienation they often feel from one another in the same neighborhoods and communities.
There are real objective reasons for a lot of these problems. After all, for most people the work week is lengthening and incomes are declining, the job growth of the country has been very weak, the crime rate is high, and there's a sense of real alienation there. And I don't think we can speak to them just with programs. I think that in our different ways that's what both Hillary and I were trying to say.
And the thing I was trying to say to the American people at the Cooper Union that I want to reiterate today is that you can never change if you have no belief in the potential of your country, your community or yourself, and that the easy path is cynicism, the easy path is to throw rocks. The better path is doing the hard work of change.

 	 	 		. . .	 	As I said at Cooper Union, when President Kennedy occupied that office, nearly three-quarters of the American people believed that their leaders would tell them the truth and that their institutions worked and that problems could be solved.
So there was a lot more elbow room there. You know, a year or two years could go by, people could be working on something with maybe only slightly measurable progress, but the country felt that it was moving forward. That is what we have to restore today, a sense that it can be done, and it cannot be done by the President alone, but the President has to keep saying that, that faith is a big part of this.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Justice Dept. Nominee
 Q. Okay. I'd like to go back to your Justice Department for just a second, Mr. President, since during the campaign you said it was a mistake and in fact apologized for playing golf at an all-white country club in Little Rock, shouldn't it disqualify your nominee for associate attorney general, Webb Hubbell? Is there an exception because he's a family friend and, and are the local ----
A. Absolutely not.
Q. ---- are the local civil rights leaders wrong when they say that his attempts to integrate the club appear to have been a last-minute political conversion?
A. No, as a matter of fact, if you go back -- first of all, let me, let me -- the first question is no, he should not be disqualified. The second question is, is it a last-minute conversion? The African-American who joined the club testified that Webb Hubbell had been trying for years to get him to do it and he had not agreed. That's what the record shows.
Thirdly, my belief is that the overwhelming majority of African-American leaders in my state would very much like to see him confirmed.
He's always had a reputation as being a strong advocate of civil rights whether as Mayor of Little Rock or chief justice of the Supreme Court of my state.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Strength of Policy
 Q. Mr. President, I want to go back to a question that Helen asked earlier about your indecisiveness over Bosnia. I'm wondering how you think that's affected perceptions of you as a leader. There is a concern reflected in polls and in some comments from Democratic members in Congress that you are indecisive and perhaps not tough enough to tackle all the problems.
A. Well, I'd just like to ask you what their evidence is. When Russia came up the United States took the lead and we got a very satisfactory result. When I took office, I said we were going to try to do more in Bosnia. We agreed to go to the Vance-Owen peace process, and two of the three parties signed on. We got enforcement of the no-fly zone. We began to engage in multinational humanitarian aid.
We got much, much tougher sanctions. We got the threat of military force on the table as a possible option, Milosevic changed his position all because this Administration did more than the previous one.
And every time I have consulted the Congress, they say to me in private this is a really tough problem, I don't know what you should do, but you're the only president that ever took us into counsel beforehand. Instead of telling us what you were going to do, you actually ask us our opinion. I do not believe that is a sign of weakness. And I realize it may be frustrating for all of you to deal with the ambiguity of this problem, but it is a difficult one.
I have a clear policy. I have gotten more done on this than my predecessor did, and maybe one reason he didn't try to do it is because if you can't force everybody to fall in line overnight, the people that have been fighting each other for centuries, you may be accused of vacillating. We are not vacillating. We have a clear, strong policy.
In terms of the other issues, who else around this town in the last dozen years has offered this much budget cutting, this much tax increases, this much deficit reduction, and a clear economic strategy that asks the wealthy to pay their fair share, gives the middle class a break and gives massive incentives to get new investment and new jobs in the small business community and from large business as well?
I think -- you know, I don't understand what -- on one day people say he's trying to do too much, he's pushing too hard, he wants too much change; and then on the other day says, well, he's really not pushing very hard.
I think we're getting good results. We've been here three months, we've passed a number of important bills, and I feel good about it.
I think the American people know one thing: that I'm on their side, that I'm fighting to change things, and they're finding out it's not so easy. But we are going to get a lot of change out of this Congress if we can keep our eye on the ball and stop worrying about whether we characterize each other in some way or another and keep thinking about what's good for the American people.
Every day I try to get up and think about not what somebody characterizes my action as, but whether what I do will or will not help to improve the lives of most Americans. That is the only ultimate test by which any of us should be judged.
Thank you very much.

Is He 'Merchant of Death' or Scapegoat for U.S.?

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
He has been called the "merchant of death" and a "black widow spider" by United States officials, but he is known around town by diplomats and officials as Carlos, the man who amassed hundreds of millions of dollars by making lethal weapons and exporting them to Iraq.
For two years the United States has been investigating Carlos Cardoen Cornejo in connection with the illegal export of zirconium for use in cluster bombs for Iraq in the late 1980's. 
 Instead of lying low, Mr. Cardoen is fighting the investigation with a public relations offensive, accusing Washington of "business terrorism." He asserts that he is the scapegoat for an ill-fated effort by the United States to arm Iraq for its war with Iran in the 1980's, an idea that eventually backfired on the United States when President Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait in 1990.
"At the time, everyone was assisting him," Mr. Cardoen said of Mr. Hussein during the 1980's. "We all thought he was the defender of the Western world when he was fighting the Iranians. Everyone was happy about my selling arms. American officials patted me on the back. And now the good guy has turned into the bad guy, and there is witch hunt out for me."
 
A Pariah, He Says
 Formerly Chile's most important arms manufacturer, Mr. Cardoen is now fighting for his economic life. He says the publicity surrounding the inquiry has made him a pariah, shunned by companies he had profitable business relationships with.
His contract to service Bell Helicopters was revoked. His license to manufacture Lee jeans in Chile was canceled. Talks with the defense contractor General Dynamics stopped, and at the request of his partners, Mr. Cardoen had to pull out of a mining service business he started in Utah in the 1970's.
United States officials have also seized real estate development projects worth an estimated $30 million in Florida and impounded one of his helicopters, accusing him of intending to send it to Iraq for military use.
Mr. Cardoen does not deny that he got rich from dealings with Iraq. After establishing ties with the Baghdad Government in the early 1980's, he eventually sold Iraq 29,000 cluster bombs worth more than $200 million, as well as other military hardware like fuses, bringing his estimated sales to more than $400 million.
"I am a businessman and produce a number of things, and I have manufactured weapons under the laws of Chile," he said. "They decided to investigate me over two years ago, without so far any charges or findings. Nobody has come with any proof of the rumors and obscenities they had said. My reputation is on the floor. I don't know how to gain my reputation back."
 
Concentrating on Chile
 But as he awaits the outcome of the investigation, which is expected to be announced in May, the Chilean businessman says he has sold holdings in weapons companies in Greece, Italy and Spain. He is now concentrating on Chile, where he owns forest land, grows kiwi and other fruits for export, owns the Tarpaca vineyard and is making steel and aluminum.
His cluster-bomb plant in the northern town of Iquique is padlocked and in the process of being transferred to a Government company, he said.
Mr. Cardoen says his dealings with Iraq were common knowledge to the United States. During an interview in his paneled office, which is lined with paintings including one of the coronation of Napoleon, he brings out photographs that show him talking with American ambassadors and military officers at arms shows where his cluster bomb was on display.
He acknowledges that the export licenses in question were not filled out correctly and that an employee who completed the form did not indicate that the zirconium would be used for military explosives. But he maintains that the United States knew the controlled material would be used for bombs for Iraq and that he was not aware at the time that the application had been filed incorrectly.
Between 1984 and 1988, Cardoen Industries bought 100 tons of zirconium from the Teledyne Corporation. Zirconium increases the heat of a blast, enabling it to penetrate armor. It is used to enhance the explosion of a cluster bomb, which detonates above a target and rains bomblets and shrapnel over a large area. The Iraqis are said to have used the bombs against Iranians who surged in "human waves" against the Iraqis on the battlefield.
 
Miami Offices Raided
 In 1991 the United States started moving against Mr. Cardoen's companies in Florida. As the United States was bombing Iraq, Federal agents stormed Cardoen Industries in Miami and seized files and documents.
In April 1992, Federal prosecutors filed a civil suit in Miami, accusing Mr. Cardoen of money laundering and illegally exporting zirconium. The Government also obtained court permission to seize almost $30 million in his properties.
At the time, Carol Hallett, Commissioner of the Customs Service, called him a "black widow" spider with a web of companies and bank accounts that "circled the entire globe," and said he was "one of the world's most notorious merchants of death."
His Washington lawyer, Roger Zuckerman, argues that the Federal authorities "decided Cardoen was politically expendable in early 1991, so he went from being a friend to a foe, because United States policy changed."
 
Chile Rebuffs Investigators
 But the investigation has hit some snags. Attempts to solicit help from the Chilean Government were rebuffed. Mr. Cardoen has deep connections with the political right as well as strong ties to the current center-left Government of Patricio Aylwin.
Eduard Palmer, Assistant United States Attorney in Miami, would not comment on the case. The Government's investigation into Mr. Cardoen's activities was set back in April, when a Florida judge presiding over the civil case ruled that the Government had not shown enough evidence of criminal activity to justify a delay in the civil suit. Federal prosecutors had been trying to delay discovery proceedings by Mr. Cardoen's lawyers, arguing that they would impede the criminal investigation.
The charges against Mr. Cardoen may in the end go far beyond the problem of an incorrect export application. United States officials are also looking into allegations that Mr. Cardoen helped President Hussein build a chemical weapons plant, supplied special equipment to build a uranium concentrator that was part of Iraq's nuclear program, and in fact kept trying to send weapons to Iraq after the United Nation's arms embargo was enacted. Mr. Cardoen flatly denies this.
But his recent statements that he communicated with American officials, including the Central Intelligence Agency, about his Iraqi dealings, could, if substantiated, greatly weaken the Government's lawsuit. Moreover, any public trial could disclose embarrassing details of the relationships Iraq had with the Reagan and Bush Administrations.

HEADLINE: Tariff Cuts Advance in New Talks

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 14

 BODY:
Trade ministers from the United States, the European Community, Japan and Canada breathed new life into moribund global trade talks today.
As part of what the ministers described as significant progress here, the United States and the European Community were in nearly complete agreement on a package of tariff cuts, including a significant series of cuts offered by Japan that could spur imports to Japan and even more business between the world's two largest trading entities. 
 Substantial tariff cuts are envisaged for products like wood, paper, pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, spirits and beer and medical and scientific equipment, according to a senior American official.
 
Plenty of Roadblocks
 Disagreements remain in electronics, where resistance comes from Europe, and textiles, where the United States is balking. And a statement issued on Thursday by the new French Government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur appeared to complicate prospects for the talks, sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and known as the Uruguay Round.
"We are working aggressively to overcome any differences we might have," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative.
Sir Leon Brittan, the Commissioner for International Trade of the 12-nation European Community, echoed that sentiment, adding, "If there is a recession in the world, the way to deal with it is to reduce barriers and increase trade."
Japan, which had been repeatedly pressed to do far more to open its markets, came up with a new tariff-cutting offer that could mean greater access in electronics, construction machinery, medical science equipment, chemicals, film and rubber, according to the Japanese Trade Minister, Yoshiro Mori.
 
Criticism by Washington
 Japan registered a global trade surplus last year of $136 billion, about a third of which was with the United States, and has been the target of unusually sharp criticism recently from Washington.
But in reacting to Mr. Mori's offer, Mr. Kantor was full of praise for the Japanese. "I was very pleased with the representation of the Japanese Government, as I think my colleagues were," said the American trade chief. "Minister Mori," the American added, "played his role well as a cleanup hitter."
The Japanese offer relates to 770 products, and 90 percent of the tariffs on them would be cut to zero. It would bring the average Japanese tariff to 1.6 percent from 1.9 percent. Still, officials here noted that the impenetrability of the Japanese market owed more to innumerable nontariff barriers.
The French have expressed opposition to a trans-Atlantic agreement on farm subsidies reached last November, and have threatened a veto within the framework of the European Community. "If people want to go too fast and force our hand," the Balladur statement said, "I am sorry to say that they are likely to be disappointed."
The ministers here said they had not had time to study the French document and withheld comment, except for Sir Leon, who noted that he would be seeing Mr. Balladur in Paris on Monday and that the French were seeking "an outcome of the Uruguay Round that is balanced and fair."
A veto would throw the European Community into a deep political as well as economic crisis, and many analysts doubt the French would go that far.
Yet today's meeting, despite the French statement, put in place an intensive process for achieving agreements on substantial tariff cutting by the time of the Tokyo economic summit meeting of the heads of the seven powerful industrial nations in Tokyo July 7.
"We agreed that we want to achieve a positive outcome to the round this year," said the Canadian Minister for International Trade, Michael H. Wilson, who was chairman of the meeting.
 
New Deadline for Talks
 Today's meeting set out a series of mileposts for getting at least a tariff-cutting agreement in the works by the July summit meeting. The hope is to bring other countries aboard by a new deadline for the round's completion, next Dec. 15. More than 100 countries are participating.
The same four ministers said that they would meet again in Paris on June 2 and then in Japan on June 24. There will be meetings as well of senior officials and trade negotiators in the efforts to create a package of global concessions.

HEADLINE: Treasury Securities End Day Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday, with longer-term securities outperforming shorter maturities as inflation jitters continued to dominate trading.
The mixed performance came as the week's reports of rising consumer and producer price inflation brought speculation that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates to curb inflation. While many bond traders do not believe the central bank is prepared to push up interest rates soon, the sentiment nevertheless hurt shorter-term maturities. 
 Higher interest rates would hurt prices at the short end of the Treasury market the most, since the central bank sets monetary policy by manipulating rates of shorter-term maturities. Higher interest rates hurt the value of existing securities, tending to push down their price.
Longer-term bonds, whose value is eroded the most by inflationary increases, could conceivably benefit from a less inflationary Fed policy.
 
30-Year T-Bond Price Rises
 Yesterday, the price of the Treasury's 30-year bond rose 3/32 point. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 6.94 percent from Thursday's 6.95 percent.
In remarks apparently designed to soothe battered financial markets, President Clinton said at a news conference that longer-term inflation remained subdued despite the week's reports of an unexpected surge in prices last month. But the bond markets failed to recover on his words, which came after a morning report of industrial production that reinforced fears of inflation.
"Clinton has no real power to make policy," said Russell Abbott, a trader in Government securities at the First Boston Corporation. "The sentiment is the only thing relevant. And the sentiment is that the front end has problems."
In its morning report, the Federal Reserve said capacity utilization, a measure of production at factories, was 81.4 percent for April, the same as a revised figure for March.
 
'Another Little Signal'
 "It's another little signal out that there could be some room for inflation pressures to be building," said David Ader, a market strategist for Technical Data in Boston.
The news reinforced this week's two Government reports showing key measures of inflation rose in April much more rapidly than expected. However, reports that the Federal Reserve bought intermediate securities in late trading yesterday morning, possibly for a foreign central bank, helped lift intermediate notes off their lows. The Fed typically does not comment on such purchases or sales, but market participants said that the buying apparently had focused on five-year notes as part of a mix of midrange maturities.
The purchases helped the five-year note recover nearly half its losses during secondary trading, Mr. Ader said .
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities fell between 1/8 point and 3/16 point and intermediate maturities were off between 3/32 point and 5/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 2.99 percent as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point, to 2.94 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.14 percent as the discount rose 0.04 point, to 3.06 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 3.31 percent as the discount rose 0.02 point, to 3.20 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 101 11/32, down 1/32 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.86 percent.

Gold and Other Metals Slip As a Volatile Week Ends

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices retreated yesterday, but remained near their 17-month highs, capping a volatile trading week caused by fears of inflation and tighter supplies.
Other metals also retreated. 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for June delivery lost $1, to $368.30 a troy ounce. May silver slipped 1.6 cents, to $4.444 a troy ounce.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum for July delivery settled $5.70 lower at $386.10 a troy ounce. June palladium fell $2.25, to $119.85 a troy ounce.
In addition, copper dropped sharply, with the July contract falling 3.55 cents a pound, to 79.65 cents, on the Comex.
 
Recovering Since March
 The gold market hit an eight-year low of $326.90 in March. It has slowly recovered since then. But on Wednesday and Thursday June gold skyrocketed a total of $12 an ounce.
Traders had expected yesterday's gold trading to be to be hectic because a large number of gold options owned by Sir James Goldsmith, the European financier, were due to expire. The gold call options, giving him the right to buy gold at prices below current levels, were forcing traders who sold the options to buy gold futures to cover their positions.
But Ian MacDonald, the manager of precious metals marketing at Credit Suisse in New York, said most traders who sold gold options had covered their positions by Thursday, when gold rose sharply. Yesterday, he said, "We were quite amazed at how steady it was."
 
Demand Remains High
 Among the factors pushing up gold prices were Government reports showing that inflation was rising.
In addition, Gold is being mined in fewer places and demand remains strong, particularly in China.
In other commodity markets, energy prices continued to slide because of large inventories of petroleum products.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for June delivery fell 30 cents, to $19.48 a barrel. June heating oil fell 0.43 cent, to 53.60 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline dropped 0.49 cents, to 58.85 cents a gallon, and June natural gas fell 0.009 cent, to $2.26 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops as Hopes Dim For Rate Cuts in Germany

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar slid yesterday amid declining hopes for a cut in German interest rates and concerns about the strength of the American economy.
High German interest rates have attracted investors to the German mark at the expense of the dollar. 
 Expectations that German rates might come down had supported the dollar, but remarks by German officials quickly changed the market's view.
Lothar Meuller, a board member of the Bundesbank, said the German central bank was being cautious about cutting its official interest rates because of a rise in long-term market rates.
On Thursday, the Bundesbank's president, Helmut Schlesinger, said the central bank would not adopt "a sledgehammer" approach to lowering interest rates.
Several American economic reports released yesterday were mildly negative for the dollar. A report of a one-tenth of 1 percent rise in industrial output in April offered a glimmer of hope for the economy, but that was offset by a separate report showing a large pileup in unsold goods in March.
Also, the University of Michigan survey of economic confidence showed a significant decline in early May.
"None of the numbers were very encouraging, but the reason the dollar didn't come even lower is because the German economy is so bad," said Jack Griffin, a foreign exchange dealer at the Fuji Bank.
The dollar fell to 1.6013 marks in late New York trading, down from 1.6170 on Thursday. Earlier in London, the dollar ended at 1.6015 marks, down from 1.6165 on Thursday.
The Japanese yen rose amid reports that Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said a stronger yen was helping American manufacturers. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 110.80 yen in late dealings, down from 111.80 on Thursday. It ended in Tokyo at 111.65 yen, down from 111.68 late Thursday.
The British pound firmed to $1.5400 in New York, from $1.5220 late Thursday. Earlier in London, the pound traded at $1.5375, up from $1.5215 Thursday.

HEADLINE: Survey Shows Confidence Off

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence waned in May for the fourth consecutive month, according to a survey by the University of Michigan.
The university's preliminary consumer sentiment index for May fell to 81.9 from 85.6 in April, people with access to the survey said. 
 Economists said the decline in confidence made it hard to accept that inflation was accelerating, as this week's Government reports indicated, since it did not indicate that consumers were prepared to pay higher prices.
The Michigan report "suggests to me the economy will continue to muddle along and that inflation is not now a problem," said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
The Michigan index hit its lowest reading since October, when it stood at 73.3. The index jumped in the months after President Clinton's election last November and has fallen since his inauguration.
The record high for the sentiment index is 97.9, set in January 1989. The record low is 63.9, set in October 1990.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: BY Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Finding Net Worth
 
Q. How can I calculate my net worth?
 MARK JACKLER, Scotch Plains, N.J.
A. Net worth represents the difference between an individual's or a family's assets and liabilities - and can be easily calculated. The most common assets are cash, securities, real estate and personal property. Other assets include the cash value of life insurance, a vested interest in retirement plans and loans to others. 
 Determining the value of certain kinds of assets is more difficult than it is for others. "There are a number of ways to value stock in a family business, such as book value or a multiple of earnings," said Stanley H. Breitbard, national director of personal financial services of Price Waterhouse. "In valuing real estate, such as a personal residence, you should look at recent sales of comparable properties."
Liabilities typically are mortgages, credit-card debt, personal loans and taxes that are due.
 
Credits vs. Deductions
 
Q. Why are credits more valuable than deductions when calculating your income tax?
 WALTER BORON, Manhattan
A. A credit is usually a dollar-for-dollar subtraction from a tax. For example, if your tax would have been $100 and you have a $30 credit, the tax is reduced to $70. Most credits can only offset the tax otherwise due, but a few will result in the Government writing you a check to make sure you get their full value.
A deduction, on the other hand, is subtracted from your taxable income and its value is equal to your highest tax rate. For instance, if you are in the top tax bracket of 31 percent and contribute $100 to a charity, you receive a $31 tax deduction and the real cost of your contribution is $69.
"When your income is high enough to be triggered into the alternative minimum tax, you have to recompute your tax liability without most of your deductions," said Richard M. Cummins, a partner of Coopers & Lybrand. And that means the amount you pay will be greater than if your tax is computed the regular way.
 
Annual Percentage Rates
 
What does the term annual percentage rate mean in connection with a loan?
 NANCY LESSER, Manhattan
A. The annual percentage rate, or A.P.R., is a term defined by Federal banking regulations and is the best benchmark for customers who want to measure and compare the cost of credit. Other interest rates do not give you a picture of the real finance charge and should be converted into the A.P.R.
Essentially, the A.P.R. is the cost of credit on a yearly basis, expressed in the form of a simple percentage. According to the Consumer Credit Protection Act, every consumer loan agreement must disclose the A.P.R. in large bold type.
"For most loans, the A.P.R. includes all costs associated with getting the credit, including the interest, points, appraisal fees and credit report fees," said Nessa Feddis, senior Federal counsel of the American Bankers Association. "For mortgage loans, however, points are part of the A.P.R., but other standard fees are not included."

HEADLINE: My Hopes, My Fears, My Disease

BYLINE: By Dennis deLeon; Dennis deLeon is New York City Human Rights Commissioner.

 BODY:
For four years, I have been torn about when and how to say publicly that I carry H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. There were always too many compelling reasons not to say anything. Every such excuse started with the word "fear" -- fear of employment discrimination, fear of the politics of AIDS, fear of becoming a pariah.
When I contemplated disclosure, I felt that my hope to continue contributing to society as a lawyer and human rights activist was threatened. Would I be evaluated on my merits if I sought to be a judge, a law professor, a law firm member or a governmental appointee? 
 Mayor David N. Dinkins has known of my H.I.V. for two years and has remained supportive of me and committed to my abilities. But what about my next employer? As Commissioner of Human Rights, I have overseen hundreds of cases in which H.I.V.-positive New Yorkers and their families have been shunned by colleagues and employers. Often, the person is transferred into a meaningless position, passed over for advancement or fired. Such treatment is often made to appear superficially legitimate but is frequently revealed through investigation to be based on discrimination. Why should I put up with this?
Another reason for not discussing my status was the crazy quilt of social activist roles I am given to play as a Latino, a gay man and a person with H.I.V. These are not easy paths to simultaneously follow. New York's Puerto Rican and Latino political agenda has never recognized the needs of the thousands of us who are gay and lesbian.
Conversely, gay and lesbian leaders rarely speak to the needs of the racial and ethnic minorities. A cursory glance at the boards of most gay organizations reveals only token recognition of the city's Latino homosexual presence. The unspoken rule is that you can exist only as one thing at a time -- a Latino or a gay man -- with no recognition of reality's complexity.
Add an H.I.V. diagnosis to this mix and it gets complicated. A few Latino leaders seek to portray AIDS organizations as a powerful white presence that takes things away from women, families and racial minorities with H.I.V. These leaders often want to redirect state AIDS funds away from mainstream gay groups to Latino-run organizations with little experience in dealing with gays and lesbians. On the other hand, some gay and lesbian service providers, such as the Gay Men's Health Crisis, have tried to cover all the city's ethnic groups when Latinos may be better served through developing our own H.I.V. service organizations.
I have been concerned about what the words "person with H.I.V." would do to my self-image. But I now know that I will not let a phrase control my potential. If I don't feel sick, why should I tell myself I am? I avoid the crepe hangers and knowing looks of pity. Why become the prisoner of uninformed beliefs about the productive potential of persons living with H.I.V.?
Given all of these reasons for not being public about the disease, why come out? Why put my professional and economic life in jeopardy? Why subject my partner of 15 years (who is H.I.V. negative) to possible reprisals just for living with me?
The simple answer is hope. If more people proclaim their H.I.V. status, we will change the way society treats persons with the virus. My hope is not based on any expectation that discrimination will end tomorrow but on a sense that it is good to show society that people with H.I.V. are leading productive lives and will tenaciously resist attempts at exclusion.
We need more role models like Thomas K. Duane, the New York City Council member; Ronald Johnson, the Mayor's AIDS services coordinator, and the hundreds of others who have disclosed their H.I.V. status. Every time the public sees one more person with the virus leading a productive life, the possibility of eliminating AIDS-based bigotry becomes more tangible.
Ultimately, the decision to disclose rests with every individual. But it's time for more of us with the virus to begin thinking about crossing the threshold. For me, hope lies on the other side of fear.

HEADLINE: Landmarks Preservation Works for New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Some disgruntled applicants to New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission are described in an April 28 news article. But put in perspective, the Commission has almost 19,000 buildings in its purview, and the 10 preservationists on its staff annually issue approximately 4,000 permits for alterations to them. Ninety percent of these permits are reviewed and granted in a few weeks and materialize as improvements to the city's most treasured buildings.
In the TriBeCa West Historic District, for example, in the first 18 months after it was designated May 7, 1991, 52 of the area's 220 buildings received permits for work. That is, almost 25 percent of the buildings in the district underwent renovation and reinvestment, in an otherwise sluggish economic climate. 
 The largest of the projects approved is the New York Blood Center, planned for a 175,000-square-foot 19th-century warehouse, with a $25-million acquisition and construction budget, and a projected payroll of 500 to 600 jobs. Plans for the blood center were presented to the Landmarks commissioners and approved on the same day.
Smaller projects include scores of residential loft conversions and shops, restaurants and other small businesses, which are increasingly important to New York City's economy. More than 200 business owners in TriBeCa recently joined a committee in support of proposed TriBeCa east, north and south historic districts, affirming their enthusiasm for landmarks designation and the value it has for them.
Landmarks preservation has immeasurably improved the city's quality of life. The complaints of a few should not overshadow the benefits to many.
