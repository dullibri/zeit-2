HEADLINE: Buyer of Rowland's Condo to Plead Guilty to Giving False Tax Information

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
A federal investigation into Gov. John G. Rowland's activities gained a crucial witness yesterday when a Connecticut antiques dealer with direct ties to the governor agreed to plead guilty to supplying false tax information about his purchase of the governor's Washington pied-a-terre in 1997.
 Wayne E. Pratt, an antiques dealer who appears frequently on the PBS television program ''Antiques Road Show,'' has been cooperating with prosecutors since January, lawyers familiar with the investigation say. Prosecutors are trying to determine whether he paid the governor more for the condominium than it was worth. 
 The plea agreement Mr. Pratt reached yesterday gives him further incentive, lawyers say, to testify on matters important to prosecutors. Those will almost certainly involve Robert V. Matthews, a friend of the governor who was Mr. Pratt's frequent business partner and closest friend.
 Mr. Matthews's companies have received $8.7 million in rent and $4.8 million in loans and loan guarantees during Mr. Rowland's tenure. This is the second big break in the government's case since Lawrence E. Alibozek, Mr. Rowland's former deputy chief of staff, pleaded guilty last March to accepting cash and gold for steering state contracts.
 Until now, prosecutors had been focusing heavily on the governor's history of letting others pay for renovations to his vacation cottage. But their inquiries have now spread to other facets of his life, including his acceptance of excessive rent and an above-market purchase price for the Capitol Hill condominium.
 Lawyers with knowledge of the case said that Mr. Pratt was expected to appear in Federal District Court in Hartford on Thursday to plead guilty to a misdemeanor tax charge.
 The potential penalty is one year in prison, but his lawyer, Thomas E. Dwyer Jr., said it was his understanding that his client ''will not be sentenced for two or three years from now, and I expect the sentence to be probation.''
 He declined to discuss the condominium purchase, but said that the record would eventually show that ''Bob Matthews took advantage of his friend Wayne Pratt.''
 Defense lawyers with clients involved in the investigation called the development highly significant.
 ''It's the standard way of approaching a case,'' said James W. Bergenn, a lawyer in Hartford. ''You find someone willing to plead guilty and cooperate.''
 ''There's only been Alibozek before this,'' he said, ''and this helps the federal investigators to the extent that this fellow is credible.''
 William F. Dow, a lawyer for Mr. Rowland, said, ''Governor Rowland has done nothing wrong or illegal.''
 He added, ''There is nothing truthful Wayne Pratt can say to contradict that.''
 Mr. Pratt, a high-end antiques dealer with showrooms in Woodbury, Conn.. and Nantucket, Mass., bought the tiny condominium during Mr. Rowland's first term in office for $68,500, considerably more than the $30,000 to $50,000 that other units in the same building were fetching at the time.
 Mr. Matthews acknowledged during interviews in January that he had helped Mr. Rowland in 1996 realize some value from the Washington condominium he still owned from his days as a congressman. By his own account, Mr. Matthews first arranged for his niece to rent the place, and later suggested that Mr. Pratt buy it.
 In an interview in January, Mr. Pratt said the purchase was an ''investment opportunity that was presented to me.'' But real estate records show he sold the 278-square-foot apartment two years later for $30,000 less than he had paid.
 Lawyers familiar with the matter said that Mr. Pratt's tax problems stemmed from his having made as much as $7,000 by reporting the loss on his tax return, even though prosecutors have evidence that Mr. Matthews reimbursed him in full. The reimbursements may have taken the form of overpayments on antiques, lawyers say.
 Mr. Matthews's lawyer, Hubert Santos, said he would have no comment.
 Mr. Matthews, a businessman who has made millions of dollars on real estate and venture capital, has complained publicly that his friendship with the governor has hurt, not helped, his business interests because state agencies strain to avoid any appearance of conflict when dealing with him.
 But at least once, the governor himself made a phone call from a golf course in Waterbury in a failed effort to woo a company to Connecticut on Mr. Matthews's behalf. That company was also offered a chance to apply for $2 million in state economic development funds, but it decided against the move.The condominium sale came at an opportune time for Mr. Rowland, who just the month before had bought, with his wife, Patricia, a lakefront cottage in Litchfield. They began major renovations in July, some of which they paid for and some of which were contributed by state employees and people seeking to do business with the state.
 Mr. Pratt and Mr. Matthews have been described in news accounts as best friends and business partners. Mr. Pratt had helped Mr. Matthews furnish a house on Nantucket, and was credited with having once helped save his life when Mr. Matthews almost died from a respiratory virus.
 Their relationship is currently strained, according to people who know them, because of a partnership they formed in 2000 to buy one of only 14 original copies of the Bill of Rights.
 The document, for which they had paid $200,000, had been stolen from North Carolina during the Civil War. Federal authorities stepped in to seize it from Mr. Pratt last year as he was about to sell it for $5 million. To avoid trouble, Mr. Pratt quickly relinquished his claim to the document, now thought to be worth up to $30 million.
 Mr. Matthews, in contrast, has no interest in forfeiting his claim to the document. He is suing the federal government and Mr. Pratt for title.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: State Board Warns About City Finances

BYLINE: By Mike McIntire (NYT); Compiled by Ian Urbina

 BODY:
The New York State Financial Control Board warned yesterday that while the city's economy has grown and tax revenues are up, fiscal problems might still be on the horizon. The board cited new labor contracts for municipal employees as one potential problem. A wage increase at the projected rate of inflation would add $2.8 billion to the city's expenses by the 2008 fiscal year, an increase that the Bloomberg administration has not included in its preliminary budget estimates for the next four years. The mayor has said that the cost of any wage increases would have to be offset by savings from productivity improvements. The control board has the authority to take over municipal finances if the city fails to balance its budget. Mike McIntire (NYT)

HEADLINE: Only Machines Need Apply

BYLINE: By Todd Buchholz. 
Todd Buchholz, a former White House economic adviser in the administration of George H. W. Bush, is the author of ''Market Shock.''

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
The gross domestic product is going up, but hiring looks sluggish. Credit cards bills go unpaid, but big-screen TV's are flying off the shelves. With statistics so contradictory, maybe economists should ditch their spreadsheets for dart boards. 
 Let's leave aside all the estimates and extrapolations for a moment and ask a simple question that may help cut through all the confusion: if you were a manager, why would you hire a human being instead of a machine? Humans get sick. They daydream. And they take coffee breaks.
 The cost of capital equipment, meanwhile, from laptop computers to lathes, has plummeted since 1995. Moreover, the cost of leasing and financing new tools has fallen to the lowest levels since, well, before there were laptops and lathes. At the same time, federal tax policy has been tilted toward capital spending, with taxes on most dividends and capital gains falling to 15 percent. Changes in the tax law two years ago allow small businesses to write off $100,000 in new equipment immediately, while big firms get a temporary 50 percent write-off.
 People, however, remain relatively expensive. Let's say an applicant can deliver $35,000 of value for the firm -- and she is willing to work for $35,000 a year. Great match, right?
 Not exactly. In addition to her salary, the employer also has to pay a 7.65 percent Social Security and Medicare tax, and contribute to workers' compensation and unemployment insurance. And then there's health insurance costs: employers paid an average of $6,600 per family last year. President Bush's tax cuts chipped away at these barriers, but they are still rising -- just when the hurdle for capital has shrunk to the height of a sidewalk curb.
 Can anything be done? Well, we certainly shouldn't dissuade businesses from investing in machines. Huge productivity gains help raise our standard of living. Congress could make it less costly to hire workers by reducing the amount an employer is required to contribute to Social Security taxes for new employees. Then managers might be less likely to view a job applicant like a walking bill from a collection agency.
 Barring action by Congress, however, there is still hope for job seekers. Stein's law, named after the economist Herb Stein, declares, ''If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.'' Over the next year, as American businesses take delivery on all the technology and machines they have ordered, the ''Help Wanted'' signs will finally go up. Human workers are not yet an endangered species. After all, somebody needs to operate the equipment -- or at least turn on the coffee machine.

HEADLINE: Panel Ponders Shift in Rates Now Fixed on Student Loans

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
With Congress poised to rewrite the Higher Education Act this year, the House of Representatives is considering important changes to a popular program that allows college graduates to consolidate their educational loans at a fixed rate over many years.
 Currently, college graduates have a one-time option of combining their educational loans for as long as 30 years at below-market rates, now around 3 percent. The loans are guaranteed by the federal government, which also pledges to pay lenders and banks the difference between the fixed rate a graduate can lock in and the fluctuating market rate.
 The major banks and lenders who handle educational loans, however, have been pressing for the loans to be issued at variable, rather than fixed, rates. Companies that consolidate the loans, consumer groups and advocates for college students, however, are opposing the change because it could mean higher payments for students. 
 The State PIRGs for Higher Education, a public interest research group, estimated a student holding $20,000 in educational loans at today's rate would spend an additional $7,807 on a 20-year loan if the rate was allowed to fluctuate. 
 ''While borrowers will lose if the fixed consolidation rate is eliminated, large student loan companies and banks stand to gain by charging more profitable variable rates and protecting their loan portfolios by discouraging consolidation,'' said Kate Rube, a research associate for the group. The group proposed, instead, eliminating the taxpayer subsidies that guarantee lenders the market rate, so that the program would resemble mortgage loans, but with government guarantees against default by borrowers.
 At a hearing held by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on Wednesday, Robert Shapiro, an economist at the Brookings Institution, estimated that over the life of existing loans, taxpayers would pay $14 billion to $104 billion to subsidize the loans, depending on how high interest rates climb in the coming decades. Mr. Shapiro based his estimates on a study financed by four student lenders, including Sallie Mae, the largest holder of student loans.
 A report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, also warned that costs of the loans would rise significantly in the coming years. The implication, said Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, chairman of the committee, ''is that if we leave the consolidation loan program on autopilot, the cost could balloon, taking billions of dollars away from the very low- and middle-income students we are seeking to help.''
 Mr. Boehner said that the program was never meant to subsidize loans for college graduates at below-market rates, but rather to simplify repayment.
 But as interest rates have dropped, the amount of loans consolidated has soared, to $41 billion in 2003 from $5.3 billion in 1998, the accounting office reported. At the same time, the growing popularity of the consolidated loans is a factor behind the decline in the default rate on student loans over the last decade, to below 6 percent, which is believed to be its lowest rate ever.
 Other advocacy groups representing college students also criticized proposals to place a variable interest rate on the consolidated student loans, an idea President Bush proposed two years ago which has drawn the support of some Democrats.
 Since then, tuition increases have continued to outpace inflation, raising the profile of college costs as a political issue. At the same time, interest rates have dropped to levels not seen in decades, making the consolidation of student loans an increasingly popular option. The average college graduate today carries about $19,000 in debt, according to a study by Nellie Mae, a lender, while one who attends graduate school leaves owing about $38,000. 
 Ms. Rube's idea of eliminating the subsidies altogether also came up at the hearing. Tom Joyce, vice president for corporate communications of Sallie Mae, said that such a move would drastically alter the program.

HEADLINE: Filings by Jobless Decline for a 3rd Week

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week for the third consecutive week, sending claims to their lowest level in more than three years.
 The four-week moving average of initial claims, which irons out weekly fluctuations, declined slightly, also for a third week. 
 The number of laid-off workers seeking benefits for the first time fell by 6,000, to 336,000, indicating that the pace of job cuts is slowing. 
 Economists have been hoping that such figures will lead to more hiring, but that has yet to happen.
 David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's, called the job data encouraging but qualified his enthusiasm. ''People aren't getting laid off,'' he said, ''but they also aren't getting hired.'' 
 The Conference Board, a private research group based in New York, reported that its index of leading economic indicators held steady in February and that an indicator of current economic activity rose.
 Taken together, the reports suggest that the growth in the economy can lead to job creation quite soon, according to Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist.
 The group's leading index, a forecast of activity over the next three to six months, held steady at 115.1 after a gain of 0.4 percent in January. Economists were somewhat disappointed in the flat reading because it followed 10 consecutive months of gains -- something that has happened only twice before in the last 30 years, Mr. Goldstein said.
 The coincident index, a snapshot of the current economy, rose by 0.3 percent in February, after a downward-revised 0.1 percent gain in each of the two previous months.
 Normally, the signs of economic growth seen so far would have already led to job growth, Mr. Goldstein said. The lag between recovery in the economy and an improvement in employment has been ''longer than we're used to,'' he added.
 Mr. Goldstein said the strength in the leading indicators index was consistent with continued economic growth around 5 percent. ''The leading indicators tell us that we're not losing momentum,'' he said. ''It's hard to see how we can keep that up without job growth.''
 The leading indicators index combines 10 measures of economic activity, including the money supply, manufacturing hours and new orders for consumer goods. The Conference Board said that 6 of the 10 measurements increased in February.
 In another report yesterday, the Labor Department said the Producer Price Index, representing inflation at the wholesale level, rose 0.6 percent in January, the largest rise in three months. It reflected a big jump in energy prices, the largest since last March at the start of the Iraq war. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 0.3 percent.
 The inflation report was delayed about a month because of technical troubles, officials said.

HEADLINE: North Carolina Asks E.P.A. To Force Others to Clean Air

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
In a move that opens a new front in the clean air wars, North Carolina has petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to crack down on pollution that it says is seeping across its borders from power plants in 13 other states.
 If the petition succeeds, states as far away as Michigan would have to cut power plant pollution by more than 50 percent, while states nearer North Carolina would face reductions of 70 percent to 80 percent. 
 ''We believe we have done as much as we could in informal negotiations with other states,'' said Roy Cooper, the North Carolina attorney general. ''I believe it's up to the states to move forward to clean our air. I don't believe we can depend on Washington. We have to do it ourselves.'' 
 In addition to Michigan, the states named in the petition are Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. 
 Traditionally, Northeastern states and California have led the legal battles for clean air. North Carolina's action is a reflection of pressure on state and local governments, which face economic repercussions if they are not in compliance with tough new ozone standards that take effect on April 15 under the federal Clean Air Act. States are considering such actions as cracking down on power plants, lowering speed limits and discouraging house painting during sweltering summer months in an effort to reduce the dangerous combination of ingredients that produce ozone. Those ingredients are heat, nitrogen oxides and the volatile organic compounds that are often found in consumer products like paint and barbecue fluid.
 The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that more than half the nation's population will be living in areas that are in violation of the Clean Air Act after April 15. North Carolina, despite enacting one of the nation's strictest power plant pollution laws in 2002, says it will not be able to meet the new standards in part because of pollution wafting in from other states. Gov. Michael F. Easley and Mr. Cooper, both Democrats, sent warning letters over the past several months, urging neighboring states to adopt strict pollution controls. 
 In its petition, North Carolina is invoking a little-used but powerful section of the Clean Air Act that allows states to ask the environmental agency to address pollution from out-of-state sources. The section was last invoked in 1997, when eight Northeastern states petitioned the agency to reduce smog from the Midwest. In granting the requests of four of those states, the agency tightened pollution controls for smog nationwide.
 The agency has 60 days to respond to North Carolina's petition. If it grants the petition, the pollution sources must halt operations within three months unless the E.P.A. approves a plan that will bring them into compliance as quickly as possible. 
 Agency officials could tell North Carolina that its concerns have been addressed in proposed regulations to reduce power plant pollution in Eastern states. The proposal, called the interstate air quality rule, would gradually tighten limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide through 2015.
 Cynthia Bergman, an agency spokeswoman, said Thursday that the rule would allow the agency to ''address the needs of all states grappling with the regional transport of air pollution rather than addressing individual petitions from multiple states.'' 
 But North Carolina officials said they hoped the E.P.A. would still grant their petition. ''We believe that the remedies are not mutually exclusive,'' Mr. Cooper said. 
 At the least, environmental advocacy groups say North Carolina's petition could help push the rule toward approval. There is no deadline for its adoption. 
 ''This petition reinforces and strengthens the need for E.P.A. to finalize its interstate air quality rule currently under consideration,'' said Michael Shore, who directs the air quality initiative in the Southeast for the advocacy group Environmental Defense.

HEADLINE: Fed Favored Shift to Flexibility, Minutes Show

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in their opinion at their January meeting that they should scrap a pledge to keep interest rates low for ''a considerable period'' in favor of wording that would increase their flexibility, according to minutes of the discussion released Thursday.
 The Federal Open Market Committee -- the group of Fed board members and regional Fed bank presidents who set interest rates -- was split, however, on what should replace the ''considerable period'' language.
 The Fed had used that phrase since last August to reassure financial markets that the central bank would not be quick to start raising interest rates. 
 The minutes said the majority favored replacing ''considerable period'' with a pledge to remain ''patient'' before raising interest rates, given the fact that inflation pressures remained very low and there was continued slack in labor markets.
 A minority of Fed officials favored not replacing the ''considerable period'' language with any kind of pledge, arguing that any ''replacement language would tend to shape expectations in ways that could complicate the conduct of policy,'' the minutes said.
 This minority group also thought that with the economy in a ''strong uptrend,'' there was no longer a need for pledges that the Fed would continue to supply cheap credit for some time to come.
 The group favoring a commitment to being ''patient'' won out, however, and that pledge showed up in both the Jan. 28 Fed statement and in the statement issued after the most recent meeting on Tuesday.
 At both of those sessions, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues ended up voting unanimously to keep their target for the federal funds rate, the interest rate on overnight loans between banks, at 1 percent, the lowest level in 45 years.
 The Fed minutes showed that the central bank also discussed how it communicates its decisions to the public.
 The discussion focused on a report prepared by a working group the Fed set up last year to study the issue after Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues were accused of misleading financial markets last spring with talk about the remote threat posed by possible deflation, a sustained fall in prices not seen since the Great Depression.
 In response to the unhappiness by investors, the central bank did appoint a working group to study how it could improve communications.
 The minutes showed that a number of ideas were considered during the discussion, including releasing the minutes of the meetings more quickly and also dropping entirely the part of the Fed statement that seeks to summarize views of the balance of risks to the economy going forward. In the end, however, the panel found that it was unable to arrive at a consensus on any particular change and it asked the Fed's staff to continue studying the issue.

HEADLINE: After an Exodus of Jobs, a Recovery in Taiwan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 18 

 BODY:
Many Americans are becoming alarmed as factories and jobs disappear to China. But by Taiwan's standards, American losses so far have been modest.
 Manufacturing here has shrunk to only a quarter of the economy from half in the late 1980's, as tens of thousands of companies shifted operations across the Taiwan Strait to the mainland.
 Unemployment more than tripled, from 1.5 percent through the early 1990's to 5.2 percent in 2002. Entire industries, like the manufacture of many plastic products, largely vanished, lured by Chinese wages that are a fifth of those in Taiwan. 
 But while the economy here still has troubles, there are signs that Taiwan has turned the corner. The economy has grown rapidly since a SARS virus outbreak was quelled last June, and unemployment has dropped abruptly, to 4.5 percent, in the last few months.
 The recovery may provide lessons, economists say, for the United States and the European Union as they struggle to compete with China and other low-wage countries.
 Many jobs have come from surging exports, especially of high-technology products. There have also been more jobs in marketing, logistics and other tasks related to managing operations on the Chinese mainland, using expertise not yet available there. Heavy government spending to build roads, dams, rail and subway lines and other infrastructure projects in Taiwan has played a lesser but important role in increasing employment.
 What is less clear is whether the early stages of the economic recovery are strong enough yet to help Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, as he seeks re-election on Saturday. His handling of the economy has been heavily criticized throughout his four-year term, and he has tried to turn the race into a battle over national identity -- whether residents feel more Taiwanese than Chinese.
 Lien Chan, the presidential candidate of the opposition Nationalist Party, and his running mate from the closely affiliated People First Party, James Soong, have campaigned on the management experience of the Nationalist Party, which ran Taiwan for half a century. ''We must have a professional team which will prove to be predictable,'' Mr. Soong said. 
 The rival economic platforms are actually fairly similar. Both candidates pledge to spend $3 billion a year on public works projects to help maintain employment. Both vow to support a continuing rise in research and development by the island's booming information technology industries, which dominate world markets for products like notebook personal computers and computer motherboards.
 Most of this computer equipment is snapped together in mainland factories these days. But those mainland factories continue to rely heavily on imports from Taiwan companies like the Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation.
 The company is building a $2.5 billion factory for production of computer memory chips in a science park outside Taipei, next door to a virtually identical Powerchip factory that has been operating less than a year and a half. Fully $2 billion of the new factory's cost represents the equipment that goes inside, including more than $1 billion in gear to be ordered from the United States, said Frank Huang, the company's chairman.
 The new factory will employ fewer than 700 workers to produce $2 billion worth of computer chips annually, with most of them shipped to China to be assembled into electronic devices for the American market. Mr. Huang said that while he worried about the high investment needed per job created, he said he believed that Taiwan's technological expertise would allow it to stay ahead of China in semiconductors for years to come. He also predicted that the United States would remain the leader in supplying the manufacturing equipment for semiconductor factories.
 ''We are too experienced, we have no worries about China,'' he said.
 At the low-tech end of the economy is Delta Smooth, a company based here that molds plastic to make Christmas ornaments, picture frames, figurines and other products, mostly for the American market. The company has six employees in Taiwan handling marketing, finance, purchasing and logistics and 3,400 workers at two factories in Shenzhen, next to Hong Kong in southern China.
 Cheng Jung-wen, Delta's chairman and owner, said it was uneconomical to assemble plastic products in Taiwan, where semiskilled workers earn $1,000 a month, compared with $200 a month in China. But practically all the plastic for his company's products, along with some metal fittings and other parts, is shipped to China from Taiwan, he said, because the plastic and other materials produced in China are of inadequate quality.
 Computer chips and plastic are two reasons Taiwan's exports jumped 26 percent in the first two months of this year compared with the period last year. China overtook Japan last year as the destination for the biggest share of Taiwan exports, buying a quarter of them.
 Taiwan's exports to China soared to $35.3 billion last year, dwarfing imports, at $11 billion. The gap is cause for some concern for Taiwan officials, given their country's long-running military tensions with its neighbor.
 ''Of course, it's a concern for us -- we don't want to concentrate our market in one area, particularly in China, which is not very stable in terms of politics, and economics, to us,'' said Fadah Hsieh, the vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, which coordinates policy for Taiwan's government.
 Of course, Taiwan's recovery has been aided by some advantages that are not available to the United States. For starters, no other country has shown as much willingness as the United States to borrow overseas to maintain high levels of imports and personal consumption. Under those circumstances, it would be hard for American exports to rise as quickly as Taiwan's.
 Also, many of Taiwan's industries are also still indirectly tied to manufacturing, even if the final assembly takes place on the mainland. So Taiwan is not as vulnerable as the United States to a rapid increase in more service-oriented industries like computer programming and accounting in countries like India.
 Taiwan's economic difficulty in the last several years ''is not as serious as what has been happening in the United States,'' Mr. Hsieh said.
 Still, Taiwan's weak economic performance, at least until very recently, has also been extremely painful for some of its residents.
 Chen Cha-chin, 30, lost his job as an office messenger a year and a half ago. He has been searching for work since.
 The messenger job was his sixth since he finished his compulsory military service, and each has paid $25 to $30 a month less than the one before. He studied printing at a vocational high school and worked initially in several small factories, only to see them close or cut back staff as part of the exodus to China. 
 On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Chen visited Taipei's main municipal employment office, which is in an underground mall next to a subway line and shakes every time a train goes by. New applications at the office have plunged more than 60 percent in the last two years, and the social service workers sitting in tidy green cubicles sometimes outnumbered applicants.
 Soon after emerging from a cubicle, Mr. Chen was smiling cautiously. Three employers had asked that he come in for job interviews, and one of them, who wanted to see him Friday morning, was a publisher who needed someone to apply gold lettering to the covers of expensive books.
 ''I am very, very happy,'' he said. ''I hope I can work the day after tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: Under Rauschenberg's Spell, Mundane Turns Uncanny

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
''Robert Rauschenberg: Current Scenarios,'' an exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art here, touches on just three distinct moments in the long career of one of the most influential artists of the last 50 years. It includes a series of prints based on collages of newspaper clippings, produced in 1969-70; a set of large sculptural assemblages made of junk metal in 1986-87; and, from 2003, a series of expansive photomontages.
 Now you may not be interested in Mr. Rauschenberg; he is 79 and has been so repetitiously and indiscriminately prolific over the decades that he often disappoints and bores even ardent admirers. And you might suspect that a selection as circumscribed as this one -- lacking any of his well-known masterpieces from the 50's and 60's -- could not make a very compelling exhibition. 
 But it is, at least in part, for just these reasons that the Wadsworth's exhibition is refreshing and illuminating. It is not a small show -- it includes 69 works -- but it is economical enough to shine a clarifying light on the nature and the import of Mr. Rauschenberg's enterprise.
 Admittedly, there is nothing much new about the new paintings: loosely gridded photographic images, mostly of gritty urban scenery, on cream-colored surfaces measuring about 7 by 10 feet. (The imagery looks as if it has been imperfectly applied by silk-screen, a method Mr. Rauschenberg started using in the early 60's, but in fact it was transferred by a photographic process.) Still, they are surprisingly lovely. With their grainy, diaphanous textures and smudgy, bleached and sometimes acidic colors, the photographic images merge nicely with the parchmentlike surfaces of the panels, and the overall compositions have a drifting, dreamily cinematic poetry.
 Though never less than perfectly composed, Mr. Rauschenberg's montages seem to defy any sense of deeper meaning or higher order. With occasional exceptions, like the alligators in ''Homestead,'' most of what you see is what you might notice or, as often as not, overlook while passing through any American city or town: cars, trucks and trailers; commercial signs, street signs and handmade signs; street intersections and traffic barriers; flea markets and boarded up stores; construction and demolition sites; rubble and trash; bicycles, fire hydrants, drain spouts and manhole covers.
 The random dissonance of all this can be irritating. Art, you may feel, ought to organize, harmonize, transform and otherwise redeem the chaotic reality on which it draws for subject matter. But Mr. Rauschenberg has always resisted such traditional imperatives. He banishes the usual consolations: fantasy, illusionism, personal expression, idealism and metaphysics. He has wanted his art to be not a transcendentalist escape from the empirical mess of reality but co-extensive with it.
 This can feel like a deprivation. But people who travel to the show may find upon returning home that they have the uncanny experience of seeing Rauschenbergs everywhere they look. It's not just an incidental effect: at its best Mr. Rauschenberg's art returns us to the mundane world from which we are always inclined to drift away.
 That it is better to be acutely attuned to reality than to transcend it is more baldly, even didactically asserted in ''Features'' and ''Surface,'' two parts of a suite of silk-screens that reproduce jumbled and layered collages of headlines, articles, photographs and advertisements from newspapers.
 From a historical perspective, these are momentarily interesting, like time capsules. We read about war protests, drug offenses, environmental pollution and social welfare programs; we note the names and images of many more or less dimly remembered people: Nixon, Rockefeller, Lindsay, Jacqueline Kennedy and on and on.
 But historical interest is frustrated by the artist's refusal to organize the materials in any logical way. Business, politics, sports, entertainment and other subjects are jammed together without regard for content or meaning. Studying the prints even briefly is numbing.
 While not exciting visually, the newspaper prints do tell us something significant about Mr. Rauschenberg. They highlight his distrust of conventional habits of organizing the world; habits of mind that filter out the unpredictable, the incongruous and the ordinary and so deaden our responsiveness to the empirical and the flux of reality. The series argues for a disinterested, Zen-style attentiveness to things as they are and as they happen.
 Eight sculptures from a series called ''Gluts'' give Mr. Rauschenberg's impulse to embrace the uninteresting, ugly and worthless a monumental grandeur. They include assemblages made from bent and dirty railroad signs or green and white highway signs; the torn-off back of a train car with a stainless steel bedpan inserted into a rectangular opening near the middle; and a soaring arrangement of torn and battered parts of a billboard-size sign with big red letters and dollar signs on a yellow ground.
 A wall text explains that the ''Glut'' series was prompted by a visit Mr. Rauschenberg made to his home state, Texas, in 1986. At that time a glut in the oil market had thrown the state into recession, turning the rural landscape into ''a wasteland of dereliction and decay'' strewn with failed gas stations, abandoned cars and rusting oil barrels.
 The ''Glut'' sculptures don't broadcast any obvious political messages, but in his care for the cast off and thrown away a deeper kind of politics may be read: a radically democratic resistance to established, discriminating hierarchies of valuation. If utopia can be built on a foundation of simple spiritual generosity, then Mr. Rauschenberg is your architect.

''Robert Rauschenberg: Current Scenarios'' remains at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, through Sept. 5.

HEADLINE: As Oil Futures Set New Highs, Should Investors Start to Fear Inflation?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
REMEMBER inflation?
 It is the forgotten economic problem, one that virtually everyone assumes is a problem of the past, not the present or future.
 Reports of surprisingly strong consumer and producer prices did not bother the stock market this week. Investors still remember that less than a couple of years ago it was deflation that seemed to be a threat. 
 It may be premature to worry a lot about inflation. But the world economy appears to be very poorly prepared for it, if it does arrive. And that fact alone may be a reason to pay more attention to inflation than it is getting now.
 Consider oil prices. Investors have become used to the idea that there may be occasional price spikes, but that quotes will soon come down. A year ago, shortly before the Iraq war, spot crude peaked at $39.99 a barrel. But even then the market was forecasting $27 oil a year later. It is a year later, and the price for April delivery is about $38. While the market still thinks prices will fall, the one-year future traded above $32 this week, its highest price ever.
 Oil is not alone. The Reuters CRB index of 17 commodities is up about 20 percent over the last year and nearly 40 percent over the last two years. The last similar two-year move before this year came in 1977-79. Then everyone was terrified by inflation; now almost no one is.
 What people are worried about now is terrorism. Terrorists seem to hit economies that are already weak. In the United States, a recession had begun months before the Sept. 11 attack, although most economists did not know it at the time. 
 European growth in 2004 was forecast to be the weakest among the world's regions even before the Madrid bombings. Ian Stewart of Merrill Lynch notes that only in Europe has the consensus growth forecast declined over the last year. Now, with Spain reeling and threats of attacks in Italy and France, a decline in tourism could end the fragile European recovery.
 Unlike Sept. 11, which briefly seemed to bring the world together in horror, this attack is stoking antiforeign sentiments. To the anger of Americans, some Europeans see safety in not being too close to Uncle Sam.
 The general rise in suspicion of foreigners is likely to fan protectionist sentiments, which were on the rise anyway. The American election campaign has included denunciations of job-exporting ''Benedict Arnold C.E.O.'s,'' as well as calls for tariffs on Chinese goods unless China allows its currency to appreciate. Such moves could end, or at best ease, the deflationary effect of Chinese exports. 
 To be sure, we are not back to the bad old days. Part of the rise in commodity prices reflects the decline of the dollar, particularly against the euro. And even in dollars, the Reuters CRB index is 17 percent below its 1980 peak.
 But the sheer confidence that investors and policy makers seem to have about inflation may in itself be reason to worry. A quarter-century ago, the consensus was that inflation was likely to run out of control forever, as global growth strained supplies of natural resources and drove prices up. That theory was discredited in the 1980's but now, as China booms, its increasing demand for commodities is one reason prices are rising.
 If inflation does become a concern, the traditional medicine of higher interest rates may not go down well. In the long run, debtors benefit from inflation by paying back money worth less than the money they borrowed. But there will be immediate pain for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages and for the American government, which borrows heavily in the short-term market.
 Higher rates would deepen government budget deficits even as they could cause consumers to cut back. They would not be good news for growth.

HEADLINE: Shell Withheld Reserves Data To Aid Nigeria

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
The Royal Dutch/Shell Group has kept secret important details of its sharp reduction in oil and gas reserves, particularly in Nigeria, for fear of damaging its business relationship with the government there and the Nigerians' desire to produce more oil, internal company documents show.
 While Shell has acknowledged that the biggest adjustments in reserves include those in Nigeria, it continues to conceal the extent of its problems. But confidential documents from late last year show Shell concluded that more than 1.5 billion barrels, or 60 percent of its Nigerian reserves, did not meet accounting standards for ''proven reserves.''
 The scale of the revision is important because Nigeria is a significant source of oil for Shell and the country is seeking to increase markedly its production quota within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The size of proven reserves is a basic consideration when OPEC sets quotas for its members. At stake for Nigeria are billions of dollars in revenue annually. 
 Shell disclosed two months ago that it had overstated its oil and gas reserves by 20 percent, which is equivalent to 3.9 billion barrels of crude oil. On Thursday, it pared its reserves by the equivalent of 250 million barrels more, most of that involving a natural gas field off Norway. Shell also postponed the publication of its 2003 annual report for two months to complete a review of its oil and gas assets. [Page C1.]
 The oil company's executives are acutely aware of the potentially explosive political effect of their cutting the estimates of Nigerian reserves. A report dated Dec. 8, 2003, and prepared for senior executives 
by Walter van de Vijver, then the top official for exploration and production, recommended that the revised Nigerian reserves remain ''confidential in view of host country sensitivities.''
 Nigeria is the world's seventh-largest oil exporter, producing about two million barrels a day, and shipping 40 percent of that to the United States. Shell documents about Nigeria portray a sometimes fragile marriage and offer a window into the kind of relationship that is considered vital to global energy security.
 Most of the world's oil is in less-developed countries like Nigeria, yet much of the financial and technological resources needed to develop that oil belong to Western oil companies.
 Authorities in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands have each opened investigations into Shell's actions, to see if the company violated any laws or securities regulations.
 By reducing its estimates of reserves, Shell has not necessarily lost any oil or gas. Instead, it reclassified some oil and gas fields as less likely to be developed soon, if at all. Timing is important to investors because it suggests how much money the company can make over certain periods and how busy it can keep its refineries.
 Reserves are also important to Shell because they can influence the company's relationship with the country where the oil and gas are found. This is particularly true in Nigeria.
 Identifying the extent of Shell's lowered reserves in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, could affect Nigeria's ''quota discussions'' with OPEC, the December report warned. Nigeria has been seeking a quota increase as part of a plan to double its daily production in the next several years. 
 Reserves are ''a key input in quota discussions,'' the report says, and since Shell's reserves constituted about half the country's total, ''an external disclosure indicating that estimates have been overstated could negatively impact the government's position.''
 OPEC officials visited Nigeria last month and the organization will discuss a new formula for determining quotas later this year, an OPEC spokesman said. Proven reserves, the spokesman said, were part of the quota calculation. Oil yields 90 percent of Nigeria's export revenue, which was estimated at $17.3 billion a year in 2002. A doubling of its production, as it intends, could mean billions extra in annual income.
 Andy Corrigan, a spokesman for Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's third-largest publicly traded oil company, declined to provide details on Thursday about the restated Nigeria reserves, saying only that they constitute a ''significant proportion'' of the overall calculations.
 E.E. Imohe, the head of the economic section at the Nigerian Embassy in Washington, said Thursday that he passed on questions from a reporter to his government this week about Shell, but had not yet received a reply.
 Protecting Nigeria's negotiations with OPEC may not be the only reason Shell has not been more forthcoming about its reserves there. The report said the publication of too much information could jeopardize the company's negotiations with Nigeria over $385 million in bonus payments.
 In any case, the documents about Nigeria offer a far bleaker assessment of Nigerian operations than the company's public disclosures.
 Nigeria, for example, has called for an end to the practice of flaring, or burning off, natural gas that is a byproduct of oil production; two billion cubic feet of natural gas are burned this way in Nigeria every day, and this has become an environmental and political issue. Mr. Corrigan said the company was committed to meeting the target. Shell's Web site says ''this opportunity'' to gather gas ''is going well.'' 
 But the Shell documents present a different view. A high-level review in December found that many oil field projects did not include plans to gather natural gas, and that ''oil production would have to be shut in,'' or stopped, unless the company found a way to use the gas. Shell could sell it in Europe or the United States, but natural gas is expensive to transport across the ocean.
 So far, Shell has not released a country breakdown of its reserve restatements, but it told analysts last month that Nigeria and Australia were the two largest. Company documents show that Shell's senior managers were told in December that 720 million barrels in Nigeria were ''noncompliant'' with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that a further 814 million barrels were ''potentially noncompliant.''
 S.E.C. guidelines on reporting reserves apply because Shell sells bonds and stock in the United States. Calculating reserves can be as much an art as a science, and there can be debate about how to do it. The S.E.C. and energy companies have been in discussions in the last few years over how to apply the guidelines. 
 At the end of 2002, Shell recorded 2.524 billion barrels of proven reserves in Nigeria, but after reviews and a tightening of company guidelines, the December report said that only 990 million barrels ''fully complies'' with the guidelines.
 The document recommended that ''any debooking of proved reserves'' in Nigeria ''not be identified publicly with Nigeria'' but classified under a wider geographic area.
 Last month, when Shell reported more details about the reserve downgrading, it said African operations accounted for 1.5 billion barrels of the revision. Shell has operations in several African countries, including Libya and Egypt, but Nigeria is the only one listed in a ''potential reserves exposure catalog'' that was distributed to senior executives late last year.
 The Shell documents, including the December report, make clear that geology is just one part of determining whether oil or gas is a proven reserve. A producer must also have firm plans to extract the resource and be ready and able to make the investment to carry out those plans; the absence of such commitments, the documents showed, was the main reason most of the Nigerian reserves did not meet the definition of ''proved.'' 
 There are different explanations for Shell's lack of progress in developing its Nigerian oil fields. A report in November by the International Energy Agency said that joint ventures -- like Shell's in Nigeria, where it is in partnership with the government -- ''suffered from underinvestment, because of a lack of state funding.'' In Nigeria, according to the international agency and to local news media reports, government budget and other developments have shifted more of the financial burden of developing oil fields to foreign investors.
 Mr. Corrigan, the Shell spokesman, said that ''government funding has been a constraint, not Shell's willingness to fund.''
 From Nigeria's perspective, the foreign oil companies are partly to blame for the slow pace of meeting reserve targets because they ''are sitting on large tracts of undeveloped acreage,'' according to Shell's understanding of a growth plan prepared by Funsho Kupolukun, who functioned as an adviser to Nigeria's president and who now manages the national oil company.
 From 1991 to 1999, Nigeria offered Shell and other foreign oil companies an incentive to increase reserves, called a Reserves Addition Bonus. Shell asserts it was owed $385 million under the bonus program, but has only sought 30 to 50 percent of the claim, according to the December report. The program applied to a different, less probable category of reserves than the publicly reported ''proved reserves,'' which have been downgraded.
 In a news conference in London on Thursday, Malcolm Brinded, the new executive in charge of exploration and production, said the restatement of reserves was unrelated to the bonus.
 ''There has been speculation on bonuses paid to company about Nigeria,'' Mr. Brinded said. ''That's a completely different issue to this proven reserves issue. It is quite another matter and totally unrelated to reserves recategorization.''
 But the December review of the problems in Nigeria and elsewhere presents a different view.
 ''While in principle a debooking of S.E.C. proved reserves should not impact on RAB,'' the review says, referring to the Reserves Addition Bonus, ''this is likely to undermine the current resolution process, or would jeopardize relations if a settlement were agreed just ahead of a de-booking,'' and adding that this would put $115 million to $170 million ''at risk.''
 There are more than financial issues behind the decline in reserves. ''Community disturbances and political instability'' were also to blame, according to the Shell report. Most of Nigeria's oil reserves are in the delta region in the south, where unrest forced the company to reduce production last year.
 Shell and the Nigerian government faced strong international criticism from human rights groups after Nigeria's execution in 1995 of Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmentalist and political campaigner who organized demonstrations to demand that Shell and other energy companies reduce oil spills and pollution, and hire more local people.
 Shell decided to pay greater attention to its civic responsibilities, but challenges remain.
 ''It's a very challenging environment for Shell in Nigeria,'' said Alex Vines, head of the Africa program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.
 Nigeria has also tried to be more publicly accountable on its handling of the oil industry. President Olusegun Obasanjo won praise last year when he promised that his country would publicly report its oil revenue. He also called for each oil company to publish its payments to governments, but some American companies and the Bush administration oppose such detailed reporting.
 Transparency International, a research and advocacy group based in Berlin, which helped organize the news conference for President Obasanjo, said that Chris Finlayson, chairman of the Shell companies in Nigeria, attended the event and welcomed the president's announcement.
 A month later, Shell's senior management recommended that details of its reserve problems and bonus negotiations with Nigeria be kept confidential.

HEADLINE: Get Smart: Buyers Try to Jump the Queue

BYLINE: By DAN McCOSH

 BODY:
MOST automotive fantasies involve a lot of horsepower, preferably wrapped in sheet metal hammered to shape in a small town in Italy. But the car that Joan Hurley of Baltimore daydreams of owning one day is a diminutive two-seater with a three-cylinder engine and just 61 horsepower. It also gets 60 miles a gallon.
 ''It's sort of a romantic notion,'' she acknowledged of her infatuation with the Smart City-Coupe, which she first saw while on vacation in Spain.
 As a romantic icon, the Smart car is more Woody Allen than Humphrey Bogart. Its beguiling appearance exudes a Jetsonesque quality that would be at home in a supporting role in ''Sleeper.'' The two-seater, also marketed as the ForTwo, is short enough to park on congested city streets with its bumper to the curb. End-to-end, two could share a single metered parking space. 
 But for a few hard-core American enthusiasts, the Smart has become the automotive equivalent of a Cuban cigar, gaining cachet partially because it is hard to get. The eco-friendly commuter car is one of the trendiest fashion statements on European roadways today, and is on sale in 30 countries, including Mexico. But though its maker, DaimlerChrysler, plans to begin selling a version in the United States in 2005 through its Mercedes dealerships, so far, like good Cohiba Coronas, Smarts are unavailable on these shores -- legally, anyway.
 That may soon change. In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration agreed that two would-be Smart importers could bring in the cars because they had shown they were capable of making Smarts meet United States safety standards. ''It's a magnificent car,'' says Jonathan Weisheit, president of J. K. Technologies in Baltimore, one of the companies planning to sell Smarts in the United States. And while he only envisions selling 1,000 or so of the cars annually, George Gemayel, president of G & K Automotive Conversion in Santa Ana, Calif., said he might be able to sell as many as 15,000 Smarts a year at $18,000 to $20,000 each.
 The importers will buy their cars from dealers in Europe or Canada (Smarts are scheduled to go on sale there in September) and then sell them on what is, essentially, the gray market. (They will also have to service them because DaimlerChrysler said it would not take responsibility for cars it hadn't imported.) Technically, conversion companies become manufacturers, assuming the responsibility for making any modifications necessary to meet American safety and emission standards. While European standards are similar, the differences that exist make it an expensive and time-consuming process for those hoping to bring in just a few cars. 
 That's what John Bristol of Dallas said he discovered when he looked into importing several Smarts with the intention of driving one and selling the others. ''I looked into importing a few,'' said Mr. Bristol, who trades oil leases. ''But it was too difficult. I'm in the oil and gas business, and I can see a need for economical cars like these.'' The Smart would not be his first gray-market car. In 1991, he bought a military Hummer direct from the factory, before a retail dealer network had been established.
 The Smart line was originally conceived by Switzerland's Swatch watch company 10 years ago as an exercise in minimalist transportation. The idea was to create an economical yet stylish alternative form of transportation for crowded city streets. After a slow start in 1998, they are now selling briskly, with about 120,000 on the road.
 Today, the cars are built by a division of Germany's DaimlerChrysler in France near the German border. The company announced last year that it was setting up a United States subsidiary, and it has been signing up Mercedes dealers in the United States to begin selling Smart models next year. Canada will be getting a two-seat Smart car this fall, but Americans won't be getting City-Coupes. Instead, they'll get small four-seat S.U.V.'s, ''about the size of a Honda CRV,'' said David Schembri, vice president for Smart USA. 
 The American cars ''will be designed with the U.S. in mind,'' he added, meaning a lineup, at least initially, of more conventional, four-seat cars, rather than the funky two-seaters many Smart enthusiasts love.
 But the bigger cars don't interest many of the Smart fans. ''We don't have any kids, and my wife drives seven miles to work. I drive 10 miles. We aren't really interested in the larger car,'' said Patrick Masterson, an architect from Virginia Beach, Va., who rented a Smart convertible while on vacation in St. Barts and is now on J. K.'s waiting list. The way the small car is designed to be both extremely compact and yet relatively crashworthy also appeals to Mr. Masterson. ''I have a respect for an unusual way of solving a problem,'' he says.
 Practicality and economy don't quite explain the passion some people feel for Smarts, which seems to approximate the early enthusiasm for the New Beetle and the Mini Cooper. Sally Jessy Raphael, the former TV talk show host, fell in love with one when she saw it in a French showroom in 1999 and put it on her credit card -- then it took her more than five months to get it through United States Customs. 
 Ms. Hurley, who is also on J. K.'s list, acknowledges having an almost irrational fascination with the car. She has even made a picture of one her computer's screen saver. ''Not everyone agrees with me. Some think it's downright ugly -- an ugly golf cart.'' She said she once saw a Smart parked in front of the Cafe Hon, a popular Baltimore spot, and while she was admiring it, a passerby stopped and asked, ''What did you do with the other half of the car?'' 
 And fans say they're not worried about driving a car seemingly designed for a Munchkin on American highways, despite the current rage for tank-size S.U.V.'s and six-passenger pickup trucks. ''Mostly, I'm concerned about parking,'' said Hernon Lucas, whose principal commute is the 12 miles from Yonkers to Midtown Manhattan. His current car is a full-size Dodge pickup, with a Hemi engine, the big V-8 that epitomizes the horsepower race.
 ''Some people look at it and have concerns about safety. I say if you get hit by an S.U.V., the S.U.V. will have a dented fender, and you will be bumped out of the way,'' said Mr. Weischeit, the Baltimore importer. (In Europe, Smart cars carry a three-star, out of a possible five-star crash rating, but a European insurance study notes that the cost of repairing the all-plastic body is roughly half that for fixing other small cars.)
 Meanwhile, a few Smart car owners are already driving their cars on the streets in the United States, after bringing them in on the automotive equivalent of a tourist visa that assumes the cars will eventually go back to Europe. One, who goes by the online name of NJChuck, has even posted photos of himself with the car, posing with it in Times Square, in front of the lighthouse in Montauk, N.Y., and with the Jefferson Memorial in the background.
 ''I like to drive it into Manhattan,'' NJChuck said in a telephone interview. He insisted that his name not be used because of concerns about his vehicle's registration.. ''I parked it alongside a stretch S.U.V. limo and took its picture.''
 But the charm of novelty is already wearing thin. ''Frankly,'' he added. ''I'm kind of tired of posing for pictures, I'm tired of putting my thumb up when the guy alongside does. I'm tired of waving back.''

HEADLINE: The Spinmeisters Of Medicare

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''U.S. Videos, for TV News, Come Under Scrutiny'' (front page, March 15) describes only a high-profile example of what is now common government public information practice. 
 The politicization of public information mirrors the takeover by political operatives of what was once the province of career civil servants.
 As a recently retired career public affairs officer, I even saw the release of routine legal, economic and statistical data, manipulated by Republicans and Democrats alike, for partisan political ends.
 The public is not well served when information it needs is spun to meet the goals of a political party.

HEADLINE: Entitlement Costs Are Expected to Soar

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
Trustees for Medicare and Social Security will report next week that the two entitlement programs will eventually need more than twice as much money as previously estimated, experts who helped prepare the calculations say.
 The new Medicare program for prescription drugs could in itself cost up to $7 trillion over the next 75 years, they said.
 The annual reports on Social Security and Medicare will include new estimates showing that the total gap between the cost of promised benefits and the revenues to pay for them is close to $50 trillion, the experts said. By contrast, the Bush administration estimated last year that the long-term gap was $18 trillion over the next 75 years. 
 Few of today's workers will be alive in 75 years, and such long-range forecasts are notoriously uncertain. But federal officials and experts on social welfare policy agree that the two programs face huge shortfalls, and they say that the projections, though imperfect, are an essential tool for policy makers.
 The new estimates are likely to intensify the political battle over entitlement programs for the elderly, whose costs are expected to soar as the oldest of the nation's baby boomers reach retirement age toward the end of this decade.
 President Bush and a growing number of conservative Republicans say that the best way to tackle entitlement costs is to shift much of the future burden from government programs to private savings and retirement accounts. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, recently urged Congress to trim future benefits ''sooner rather than later.''
 Democrats have also warned of a looming financial crisis in the decades ahead, but they have contended that the crisis would be greatly reduced if Congress simply rolled back many of Mr. Bush's tax cuts.
 The report, to be issued next Tuesday, includes the government's first effort to estimate the long-term cost of the prescription drug legislation that Mr. Bush signed on Dec. 8.
 Cost estimates for that law have become an explosive topic, after accusations that senior administration officials squelched internal estimates showing that the cost over the next 10 years would be $534 billion, rather than the $400 billion that Congressional analysts had predicted.
 The new report takes a longer view, trying to estimate the future costs of the two major programs for the elderly. In a major departure, the trustees have included a new approach under which they calculated Medicare costs on the basis of an ''infinite horizon,'' meaning an estimate based on expected costs and revenues all the way into eternity.
 As surreal as the idea of forecasting to eternity sounds to most people, a growing number of policy analysts say that such an approach provides a more meaningful picture of long-term obligations.
 The federal government has traditionally measured the long-term financial health of Social Security and Medicare by projecting costs and revenues 75 years.
 One person who has seen the trustees' forecast said prescription drug legislation would, by itself, ultimately require more than $10 trillion. In all, the unfinanced promises of Social Security and Medicare are expected to total more than $50 trillion.
 ''The numbers are huge, much higher than any of the other estimates that are out there,'' said a person who has seen the estimates. 
 David M. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States, has estimated that costs of the new Medicare drug benefit are staggering even if one uses a more traditional forecasting period of 75 years.
 ''Preliminary estimates of its long-term costs range up to $7 trillion over 75 years,'' said Mr. Walker, who was a public trustee of Medicare and Social Security from 1990 to 1995. ''To put that number into perspective, it is as much as the total amount of the federal government's gross debt outstanding as of Sept. 30.''
 The Congressional Budget Office says the new Medicare law will cost no more than $400 billion over the next 10 years. But the Bush administration and the Medicare trustees will base their forecast on the work of the chief Medicare actuary, Richard S. Foster, who put the 10-year cost at $534 billion.
 Mr. Foster estimated that the drug benefit, including extra help for low-income people, would cost $100 billion more that Congress assumed. He also said that new federal subsidies for private health plans would cost more than three times as much as Congress assumed ($46 billion, rather than $14 billion).
 In their report to Congress last year, the trustees of Medicare and Social Security -- four administration officials and two public representatives -- said Social Security had $3.5 trillion of ''unfunded obligations'' over the next 75 years.
 The gap looks larger when experts peer further into the future. When trustees and actuaries analyzed the ''infinite future,'' they estimated that Social Security's unfinanced obliga tions would total $10.5 trillion, or three times as much as the gap in the next 75 years.
 Analysts say the looming shortfalls for Social Security, big as they are, can be filled with comparatively modest adjustments to payroll contributions or future benefits.
 Most analysts believe Medicare shortfalls will be far bigger and more difficult to control, because medical costs have been rising much faster than other prices. 
 John L. Palmer, a public trustee of Social Security and Medicare who is dean of Maxwell School of public policy at Syracuse University, strongly supported projections that try to encompass all future costs.
 But Marilyn Moon, an economist and former Medicare trustee, said she had little confidence in such long-range projections.
 ''Even going 75 years into the future is a wild guess,'' Ms. Moon said. ''So many things can happen in health care between now and then.''

HEADLINE: One Year After

 BODY:
One year ago, President Bush began the war in Iraq. Most Americans expected military victory to come quickly, as it did. Despite the administration's optimism about what would follow, it was also easy to predict that the period after the fall of Baghdad would be very messy and very dangerous. In that sense, right now we're exactly where we expected to be.
 It's nonetheless important to remember that none of this might have happened if we had known then what we know now. No matter what the president believed about the long-term threat posed by Saddam Hussein, he would have had a much harder time selling this war of choice to the American people if they had known that the Iraqi dictator had been reduced to a toothless tiger by the first Persian Gulf war and by United Nations weapons inspectors. Iraq's weapons programs had been shut down, Mr. Hussein had no threatening weapons stockpiled, the administration was exaggerating evidence about them, and there was, and is, no evidence that Mr. Hussein was involved in the 9/11 attacks. 
 Right now, our highest priority is making the best of a very disturbing situation. Even our European allies who opposed the war want to see Iraq stabilized and turned over to its citizens -- even if they don't necessarily see Washington as the force to do that. The other possibility, an Iraq flung into chaos and civil war, open to manipulation by every unscrupulous political figure and terrorist group in the Middle East, is too awful to contemplate.
 This is a good moment to take stock of what has been accomplished and what has not, especially since the day is rapidly approaching when the United States hopes to turn over the governing of Iraq to the leaders of the nation's three major ethnic or religious groups -- who have shown no serious signs of being able to cooperate.

Grim Scenes From Iraq
 In the short run, the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of its leader have done virtually nothing to stop terrorism. In Iraq, as in Spain, Turkey, Indonesia and other countries, terrorist attacks have continued since the capture of Mr. Hussein. On Wednesday, and again yesterday, Americans saw on television news the flames and casualties from bombings in Baghdad and Basra by forces opposed to the American-led occupation, which have become more deadly and more sophisticated in response to every change in tactics by American soldiers. Indeed, the war in Iraq has diverted scarce resources from the war against terrorism in Afghanistan and other places.
 For many Iraqis, freedom has come at a high price. In Baghdad, civilians line up at offices where the American military doles out money to compensate them for relatives killed, limbs lost and eyes blinded in the war. The innocent Iraqi casualties of Mr. Bush's war are literally countless because the Pentagon refuses to estimate their number.
 Still, there have been important gains that are the basis of our hopes for the future.
 A bloodthirsty dictator who tortured and murdered his people, and sacrificed their well-being to his gilded palaces, is locked up. An interim constitution has been adopted, a step toward laying the groundwork for a democratic government in Iraq, should the country's fractious groups ever resolve their differences. American-led efforts to rebuild Iraq have progressed to the point that some services are better than they were under Mr. Hussein, and Iraqis are starting to express satisfaction with how things are going. Iraq's power grid, for example, generates more electricity than ever.
 Still, there are enormous gaps. According to the United States Agency for International Development, Iraq has a third less drinking water than it did before the war. And the pace of the rebuilding is alienating some Iraqis who clearly overestimated the powers and efficiency of the occupying forces. While some of that disappointment was inevitable, there was a bewildering lack of planning put into the occupation by an administration that seemed to believe its own talk about American soldiers' being greeted with flowers as an army of liberation.
 The so-called surgical bombing did indeed limit damage to Iraq's civilian areas, but American troops did not come into Baghdad in enough force last April to deter the shocking sabotage and looting that occurred. In addition, the American government, under presidents from both parties, had spent 13 years in denial about the civilian toll of the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq. The Bush administration was unprepared for the total collapse of Iraq and for the disastrous state of crucial services.

Strains on the American Military
 The American military's ability to deal with all of this -- and supervise the construction of a new democracy -- is declining by the week. Even with the current rotation, reducing American troop strength to 110,000 from 130,000, the Army, Marine, National Guard and Army Reserve forces cannot sustain the occupation.
 Roughly one in three of the Army's 480,000 active-duty soldiers are on duty overseas, and an even higher proportion of its combat brigades are either in the field or have just returned. Rotations are spaced too closely together -- some of the troops that took part in the invasion of Iraq are to return there later this year -- and that cuts into training and readiness. The strain on the Reserves and the National Guard is already enormous. While sending more American troops to Iraq is not the answer, the United States does need a larger active Army.
 For Iraq, the only answer is greater peacekeeping and police help through the United Nations, from nations as varied as France, India, Bangladesh, Russia and the Arab countries. These nations can provide more than the token forces the United States is getting from most of its current allies, but are unlikely to help until their citizens see real United Nations authority, transforming a military occupation into a legitimate exercise in international nation-building. 
 Some members of Mr. Bush's coalition are shaken by the electoral defeat of the Spanish government that joined the invasion despite the opposition of some 90 percent of its citizens. In Poland, President Aleksander Kwasniewski said yesterday that he might withdraw troops from Iraq next year earlier than planned, adding that Poland had been ''misled'' about Iraq's weapons programs.

Repairing the Diplomatic Damage
 Winning the cooperation of countries like France and Russia will require the Bush administration to be far more serious about turning over real responsibility in Iraq to the United Nations and NATO. The United Nations is, commendably, no longer so hesitant about taking the lead in Iraq.
 The Bush administration has barely begun the job of repairing the damage from its virtually unilateral rush to war last year. What the public and foreign leaders have learned about the way it managed the run-up to the invasion is only worsening the situation.
 Asking a political leader to take his country to war in the teeth of overwhelming popular opposition is tough enough. Add to that a public that feels misinformed about the reasons for the war, and you've got political combustion. Polls show that a plurality of Americans say it was worth a war simply to remove a vicious dictator -- an argument that Mr. Bush offered after it became obvious that his original justifications for the war were vaporous. But in Europe, there remains overwhelming popular opposition to the invasion of Iraq. Vice President Dick Cheney was wrong on Wednesday when he accused Spain of abandoning the war against terrorism by talking about withdrawing its forces from Iraq unless the U.N. becomes more involved. It's nonsensical to suggest that the Spanish people are appeasers, and doing so only isolates Washington further.
 This page strongly opposed invading Iraq without international backing. The events since Mr. Bush decided to go ahead with only Britain as a major ally have further underscored the recklessness of this sort of adventurism.
 It is not, as Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney have argued in campaign speeches and commercials, a question of getting permission from the United Nations to do the right thing. It is a matter of listening to the reasonable objections of proven friends, like Germany, which was privately warning Washington about the quagmire that Iraq represented.

Stability for a Divided Iraq
 The United States is now about 100 days away from June 30, when it hopes to turn Iraq's government over to Iraqis. As welcome as the adoption of the interim constitution was, it underscored how much more remains to be done before the Iraqis can begin to hope for a stable, workable leadership to govern their wounded country. So far, the United States has not found the formula for accomplishing what has in the past always seemed impossible: getting Iraq's majority Shiites, minority Sunnis and separatist Kurds to make real concessions and cooperate in governing Iraq. Days after compromising on the constitution, Shiite leaders were talking of amending it, and it took an ultimatum from Washington this week to make them back down.
 Without any culture of trust and accommodation, any form of real elective democracy empowers the Shiites, reduces the influence of the Sunnis and once again leaves the Kurds, who have long wanted to break away from Iraq, at the mercy of people they do not trust. A Shiite-dominated Iraq may run into trouble with Iraq's Arab neighbors, who generally identify with the Sunni Iraqis, who dominate the country's military and ruling classes.
 One temporary solution could be a prolonged period of Iraqi federalism imposed from the outside or an international trusteeship. Either, however, is likely to generate intense Iraqi opposition. Whatever model emerges, it must be guided by international bodies and not Washington alone.
 In some ways, the prime-minister-in-waiting of Spain, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, did Mr. Bush a favor when he said he would withdraw Spain's symbolic military force from Iraq if the United Nations' role did not significantly increase after June 30. He has, in effect, given the president time to plan and to get cooperation from those countries that can contribute real forces. We hope the president uses this time to plan his next steps better than he planned the occupation.

HEADLINE: Increasingly, American-Made Doesn't Mean in the U.S.A.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Anthony F. Raimondo, a Nebraska business executive, was all set to become President Bush's manufacturing czar until he was caught in a political firestorm last week after John Kerry's campaign suggested that Mr. Raimondo was a ''Benedict Arnold C.E.O.'' for moving jobs from the United States to China.
 But it's not that simple. What Mr. Raimondo's company did, experts of all stripes say, has become standard business practice in response to domestic and international pressures. 
 Hundreds of American companies, among them Mr. Raimondo's Behlen Manufacturing of Columbus, Neb., own facilities abroad that produce goods and services for overseas customers rather than for shipment back home. Indeed, these overseas sales, which have risen to more than $2.2 trillion annually in recent years, dwarf the nation's exports of roughly $1 trillion. 
 Should American companies turn so quickly to production abroad, rather than export from the United States -- particularly in China, where sales are growing at two or three times the rate in any other country?
 Mr. Raimondo says yes and he is far from alone. He and the chief executives of most manufacturing companies contend that such moves are essential to keep American industry competitive in the global marketplace.
 Behlen's story is telling. The company got its start in China by exporting from Nebraska prefabricated steel framing for commercial buildings, particularly factories. 
 Its biggest Chinese customer was a company that made automotive glass. ''We shipped all the steel framing for four 250,000-square-foot factories,'' Mr. Raimondo said.
 In 2000, however, his big Chinese customer shifted to one of Behlen's competitors, Butler Manufacturing of Kansas City, Mo., which offered a lower price from a factory it had opened in China in 1996 to manufacture the heavy steel products closer to where they would be used. Behlen responded to this competition by shifting from exports to production in China, at a new plant that opened last year in Beijing.
 ''We think ours is the ideal dynamic model for American manufacturers,'' Mr. Raimondo said in a telephone interview. ''I talked at length with the Department of Commerce and the White House, and they agreed that Behlen's competitive response is a tremendous message for all manufacturing. We do not outsource in the sense of bringing product back to the United States.''
 The nation's manufacturers have shed 2.7 million American jobs since Mr. Bush took office. In a bid to deflect the political reaction from so much industrial job loss, the White House announced that Mr. Bush would appoint an assistant secretary of commerce for manufacturing. Mr. Raimondo got the nod, only to have his appointment go down in flames last week after a barrage of criticism from Senator Kerry's camp. 
 Even after abandoning him, the Bush administration has reasserted its faith in Mr. Raimondo's strategies.
 ''For American companies to be competitive on a global basis, they need to be able to have the freedom to establish a beachhead overseas that allows them to expand their sales abroad,'' Grant Aldonas, the Commerce Department's under secretary for international trade, said. ''That is what Tony did.''
 Nearly 2,500 American companies are involved in production abroad for overseas customers, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, and they go overseas by one of two routes. Some companies start out by setting up factories or offices abroad, without ever exporting. Many others, like Behlen and Butler, shift from exporting to production abroad to remain competitive.
 Jobs are lost at home in the process, Mr. Raimondo acknowledged, but they would have been lost anyway if Behlen had stuck with an export strategy and thus sacrificed orders to lower-cost competitors with plants in China. ''Most of the disadvantage is transportation cost,'' Mr. Raimondo said. ''Shipping steel across the Pacific is expensive.''
 That sort of business decision was hard to explain as the presidential campaign heated up. In a press release, the Kerry camp noted that Behlen laid off 75 workers at its American factories in 2002 as its factory in Beijing neared completion. The press release never said the two were connected, but the implication was clear -- and false, Mr. Raimondo contends. 
 The American layoffs in 2002 were in response to weak demand in the United States for Behlen's products, he said. Over a three-year period, he actually laid off 500 of his 1,500 American employees as sales fell to $135 million last year from $186 million in 2000. 
 Mr. Kerry offered a different explanation. In a speech, he linked the Behlen layoffs to the shifting of work to China. The administration's ''manufacturing czar, the person they chose, has been a poster person for the very depths of their policy that has affected millions of Americans negatively across our country,'' Mr. Kerry said.
 Sara Bianchi, Kerry's policy adviser, acknowledged yesterday that competitiveness requires that some overseas customers must be supplied from production facilities abroad. But the Bush administration has allowed this process to go too far, she said.
 ''Bush is not doing enough to keep jobs here,'' Ms. Bianchi said. ''Fewer of these companies would have to make these kinds of decisions if we had a president who fought to keep manufacturing in this country through tax incentives, lower health care costs and enforcement of our trade laws.''
 Worldwide, sales from overseas facilities in which American companies control ownership rose at an average annual rate of just over 10 percent from 1989 through 2001, the latest year for which data are available. The steady expansion spanned Democratic as well as Republican administrations, reaching a total of $2.2 trillion in 2001. By comparison, shipments of goods and services to the United States -- like auto parts, computer programming and call center services -- totaled only $272 billion in 2001. Yet that is an aspect of offshoring that has become hotly disputed in the campaign. 
 Behlen's joint venture with three Chinese companies, employing 180 people, is the first overseas operation for the company, which is privately owned. 
 Until the factory opened last summer, exports from Behlen's four American plants brought in only 7 percent of the company's $140 million in annual revenues. Steel building frames had accounted for nearly half of the export revenue. Mr. Raimondo acknowledged that the company's production in Beijing for the China market had eliminated 20 to 30 jobs in Nebraska -- far fewer than Mr. Kerry contended and the jobs disappeared only after the factory opened.
 Behlen also exports prefabricated grain silos to China, and makes parts of the silos in China. Sales have risen for these silos, so production has also risen for the portion made in Nebraska, mainly thin steel siding. Three or four workers, as a result, have been added at Behlen's factory in Columbus. Still, the China strategy has resulted in a net job loss, and that loss might rise as Behlen's new factory in China expands production to serve customers there. 
 ''The China market is so large, it justifies going there,'' Mr. Raimondo said. ''I even see us opening a second plant there. Every other market we can export to, but not China. We have to be there. I wouldn't call that export substitution.'' 
 He also said he did not intend to engage in import substitution, shipping steel frames or silos back to the United States, but he qualified that statement. One product that Behlen makes in the United States is metal farm gates, used in livestock enclosures. Companies in China are beginning to ship similar gates to the United States and Mr. Raimondo says that in the worst case, Behlen might have to do the same.
 ''We don't think the Chinese can sustain these shipments,'' Mr. Raimondo said. ''The gates are heavy to ship and they involve very little labor cost. But if the shipments were sustained, we would have to figure out some technology to automate more, and if we could not do that, we might have to find other ways to compete.''

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

* ''THE DREAMERS,'' starring Michael Pitt, Eva Green and Louis Garrel. Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci (NC-17, 115 minutes). Mr. Bertolucci began his career with the observation that he who has not lived before the revolution has never tasted the sweetness of life. His newest film, an ardently romantic love song to sex, cinema and the spirit of the 60's, elaborates on this observation by finding sweetness in the midst of political tumult. The disturbances of 1968 in Paris take place mostly off screen, bursting in only at the end to wake up the three title characters. The three -- an American exchange student (Mr. Pitt) and a pair of lovely, moody half-French twins (Ms. Green and Mr. Garrel) -- spend most of the picture holed up in a luxuriously squalid Paris apartment, having sex and arguing about movies, politics and the relative merits of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Instead of mocking or patronizing their passion (as some critics are sure to do), Mr. Bertolucci treats these silly, earnest, beautiful young people tenderly and with generosity. As a testament to their love of movies, he inserts archival film clips culled from the repertory of the Cinematheque Francaise, where the three met and where the events of May began. To feed the audience's love, he photographs his fearless young actors and their surroundings with breathtaking grace. Even if the sight of naked bodies leaves you cold, some of the director's camera movements can make you gasp with delight (A. O. Scott).

* ''50 FIRST DATES,'' starring Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore and Rob Schneider. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 100 minutes). For the first few minutes this romantic comedy, directed by a veteran builder of ''Saturday Night Live'' star vehicles, looks like another crude, bullying Adam Sandler extravaganza: there are vulgar sexual jokes, a vomiting walrus and the never entirely welcome appearance of Mr. Schneider, who plays a Hawaiian stoner named Ula. But then Ms. Barrymore shows up as Lucy, a lovely art teacher suffering from temporal-lobe damage, and everything starts looking up. She goes after Mr. Schneider with a baseball bat and engages Mr. Sandler, who plays an easygoing, womanizing veterinarian, in a clever and touching romantic comedy. Lucy's injury has destroyed her short-term memory, so that she starts each day with no recollection of the one before. The film's conceit is reminiscent of Harold Ramis's immortal ''Groundhog Day.'' While ''50 First Dates,'' deftly directed by Mr. Segal from George Wing's witty and heartfelt script, does not have that film's philosophical ambitions, it does follow its premise to a risky conclusion that pays off beautifully (Scott).

''HIDALGO,'' starring Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Joe Johnston (PG-13, 136 minutes). This much too long, primitively plotted family action adventure has a handful of well-handled sequences. But given the young audience this film is intended for, watching the picture is like having to finish an entire pot of broccoli to have a couple of jelly beans for dessert. The expansive and fairly unbelievable movie follows Frank Hopkins (Mr. Mortensen), who is persuaded to leave Buffalo Bill's Wild West show to participate in the Ocean of Fire, a death-defying race across 3,000 miles of desert. The prize is $100,000. But the real star of ''Hidalgo'' is a handsome mustang who gets more glamorous close-ups than Joan Crawford did in her entire career. Eventually Frank and Hidalgo's Arabian journey is a testament to Frank's need for validation and is so full of incident that the movie is finally about as colorful, and convincing, as one of those penny dreadfuls about Buffalo Bill's own life (Elvis Mitchell).

* ''THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING'' (winner of 11 Academy Awards, including for best picture and director). Starring Elijah Wood. Directed by Peter Jackson (PG-13, 200 minutes). After the galloping intelligence displayed in the first two parts of the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, your fear may be that Mr. Jackson has become cautious and unimaginative with the last episode. But he crushes any such fear. His ''Return of the King'' is a meticulous and prodigious vision by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. The final installment follows the hobbit Frodo (Mr. Wood), increasingly fevered as the ring exercises its power over him, on the last leg of his perilous journey to Mordor to destroy this sinister object. Mr. Jackson takes his time with the story, but he is not sloughing off here. Rather he is building toward a more than solid conclusion. The grandiloquence that sustained the second installment, ''The Two Towers,'' with its pounding and operatic martial fury, can be found here. By its end ''The Return of the King'' glides to the gentle bonhomie that opened the ''Rings'' movies, but its epilogue is tinged with regret: ''You can't go back. Some wounds don't heal.'' It is an epic about the price of triumph, a subversive victory itself in a large-scale, pop-action film (Mitchell).

* ''MONSTER,'' starring Charlize Theron (winner of the best actress Oscar) and Christina Ricci. Written and directed by Patty Jenkins (R, 111 minutes). Ms. Theron pulls off last year's most astounding screen makeover in Ms. Jenkins's new film. The disappearance of the cool, creamy blond star into the body of a ruddy, bedraggled street person is more than an astounding cosmetic stunt. She plays Aileen Wuornos, the notorious Florida murderer whose career in homicide was sensationalized when the media inaccurately dubbed her the first female serial killer. Ms. Theron uncovers the lost, love-starved child cowering under the killer's hard shell while still making her a scary figure. The movie, which focuses on Aileen's desperate, last-ditch relationship with a lover, Selby Wall (Ms. Ricci), leaves the same bitter aftertaste as ''Boys Don't Cry,'' an equally somber slice of American life that features a comparably searing lead performance (Stephen Holden).

* ''OSAMA,'' starring Marina Golbahari, Arif Herati and Zubaida Sahar. Written and directed by Siddiq Barmak (not rated, 82 minutes; in Dari Farsicq with English subtitles). Working with nonprofessional actors and a tiny budget, Mr. Barmak's film is the first feature made in Afghanistan since the rise of the Taliban -- an impressive achievement made more so by the director's sure and subtle artistry. Without rancor, but also without averting his eyes from the cruelty of the Taliban's rule, Mr. Barmak paints a desolate picture of daily life under a capricious authoritarian regime that was especially harsh in its treatment of women. When her mother is chased out of her job at a dusty Kabul hospital, a young girl disguises herself as a boy and goes to work for a sympathetic shopkeeper, and as her ordeal reveals the many forms of Taliban brutality, the film also has moments of lyricism, tenderness and even comedy, as in one unforgettable sequence that explores the paradoxical idea of radical Islamist sex education (Scott).

''THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST,'' starring Jim Caviezel and Monica Bellucci. Directed by Mel Gibson (R, 120 minutes; in Aramaic and Latin, with English subtitles). Mr. Gibson's version of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus, controversial long before it was seen, is a harrowingly violent spectacle that invites the audience's revulsion in the hopes that it will turn into something like awe. After a horror-movie beginning, complete with demons, menacing music and creepy camera moves, Mr. Gibson settles into a long, relentless contemplation of torture, maiming and execution. His stated goal was realism, but the emphatic musical, visual and aural effects -- the first nail is driven into Jesus' palms with a sickening thwack that must have required hours of digital tweaking -- make the film a melodramatic exercise in high-minded sadomasochism. Despite concerns about the anti-Semitism of Mr. Gibson's portrayal of the Pharisees, the movie is more grueling and unnerving than outrageous or offensive. For a film made out of such evident religious conviction, it seems utterly lacking in grace (Scott).

''SECRET WINDOW,'' starring Johnny Depp, John Turturro and Maria Bello. Written and directed by David Koepp (PG-13, 97 minutes). If a movie requires the lead to spend a good chunk of his time on screen talking to himself, it's hard to do better than Mr. Depp, whose performance as the writer Mort Rainey is the highlight of this underwhelming film. A suspense thriller whose only suspense and thrills come from an audience wondering if the picture will hit its promised 97-minute running time, ''Secret Window'' dramatizes Mort's plight. He's suffering from writer's block, triggered by the tumultuous break-up of his marriage to Amy (Ms. Bello) and the protracted divorce proceedings. Mort lives in a remote cabin until a thunderous knock at the door rouses him from a sofa almost as lived-in as his bathrobe. The visitor is John Shooter (Mr. Turturro), who drawls menacingly, ''You stole my book.'' Sleepy and astounded, Mort gets the evidence shoved into his life. Shooter's short story reads exactly like Mort's best-selling murder mystery, ''Secret Window.'' What's worse, Shooter gives Mort three days to set things right, or else. What little intrigue the movie has comes from Mort's shattered self-esteem; he asks himself if he really was capable of stealing Shooter's story vowel for vowel. Unfortunately, such a concern may not mean a whole lot to most viewers. Then again, neither will the whole of ''Secret Window,'' which has the vague plotting generally found in an anthology horror-show episode (Mitchell).

''SPARTAN,'' starring Val Kilmer and Derek Luke. Written and directed by David Mamet (R, 110 minutes). Mr. Mamet may not be a great filmmaker, but with this moody political thriller he proves himself, once again, to be a thrillingly competent one. His tightly coiled plot and swift, economical direction shows up the bloat and incoherence that afflict most Hollywood suspense pictures these days, and the many little touches of Mametude -- jagged one-liners, swaggering repartee, William H. Macy -- make it unusually flavorful. Mr. Kilmer, his sorrowful cool nicely suited to the fiercely stylized acting Mr. Mamet requires, plays a secret agent who must rescue the kidnapped daughter of the president of the United States. The plot's twists and turns ultimately lead nowhere very interesting, but for much of its running time the picture hums along beautifully, fueled by a potent mix of technical assurance and professional braggadocio (Scott).

''STARSKY & HUTCH,'' starring Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Snoop Dogg. Directed by Todd Phillips (PG-13, 97 minutes). Mr. Phillips's big-screen adaptation has a crafty, can-you-dig-it? spirit derived from his affection for the 1970's and the original television cop series of the same name. The television show featured a pair of apparently plainclothes fuzz -- who were they supposed to be fooling? -- played by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. Mr. Phillips may not quite be a filmmaker, but he is on his way to becoming a director; his grasp of tone is a few steps ahead of his previous film, ''Old School.'' Starsky (Mr. Stiller) is probably one of those rare detectives who don't deserve the by-the-book speeches from their commanders. He is paired with another loner -- cool, shaggy Hutch (Mr. Wilson) -- who is a step away from being bounced from the force. Starsky and Hutch are tethered to a harness of buddy-movie cliches, but their congeniality comes from the actors' chemistry. Still, the movie's advertising tag line (''Starsky & Hutch -- they're the Man'') needs to be amended. The film belongs completely and utterly to Snoop Dogg. Picking up the mantle of the police informant Huggy Bear, he's the man (Mitchell).

''TWISTED,'' starring Ashley Judd, Samuel L. Jackson, Andy Garcia and David Strathairn. Directed by Philip Kaufman (R, 97 minutes). The greatest mystery in this laborious, nonsensical thriller is why Mr. Kaufman, whose credits include movies like ''The Right Stuff'' and ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' bothered to lend his talents to such mediocre studio hack work. Ms. Judd, struggling mightily to convince the world that she has a dark, complicated side, plays Jessica Shepard, a San Francisco homicide investigator who also seems to be the prime suspect in her first big case. The victims of an apparent serial killer all turn out to have been men she slept with, and the fact that Jessica's father was a cop and a murderer makes the possibility of her guilt all the more plausible. Is she the killer, or is one of her friends and protectors -- her mentor (Mr. Jackson), her partner (Mr. Garcia), her shrink (Mr. Strathairn), her ex-boyfriend (Mark Pellegrino) -- setting her up? It is hard even to be curious, much less to care (Scott).

''WILBUR WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF,'' starring Adrian Rawlins, Jamie Sives and Shirley Henderson. Directed by Lone Scherfig (R, 109 minutes). The title is accurate as far as it goes, but Wilbur (Mr. Sives) is only the most floridly despairing character in this oddly charming movie about a small constellation of lonely, taciturn Scots. For a movie concerned with suicide, depression, terminal illness and bereavement, it is curiously uplifting, and dryly funny when it could be gooily sentimental. Wilbur and his brother Harbour, who runs the family bookshop, anchor the story with their contrasting temperaments, but its fluttery, eccentric heart belongs to Ms. Henderson, who plays a bookshop customer who joins their morose and peculiar family (Scott).

HEADLINE: The Price of Freedom in Iraq

BYLINE: By Donald H. Rumsfeld. 
Donald H. Rumsfeld is the secretary of defense.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This week, as we mark the one-year anniversary of the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, it is useful to recount why we have fought. Not long ago I visited South Korea, just as the Korean government was debating whether to send troops to Iraq. In Seoul, I was interviewed by a Korean journalist who was almost certainly too young to have firsthand recollection of the Korean War. She asked me, ''Why should Koreans send their young people halfway around the globe to be killed or wounded in Iraq?'' 
 As it happened, I had that day visited a Korean War memorial, which bears the names of every American soldier killed in the war. On it was the name of a close friend of mine from high school, a wrestling teammate, who was killed on the last day of the war. I said to the reporter: ''It's a fair question. And it would have been fair for an American to ask, 50 years ago, 'Why should young Americans go halfway around the world to be killed or wounded in Korea?' '' 
 We were speaking on an upper floor of a large hotel in Seoul. I asked the woman to look out the window -- at the lights, the cars, the energy of the vibrant economy of South Korea. I told her about a satellite photo of the Korean peninsula, taken at night, that I keep on a table in my Pentagon office. North of the demilitarized zone there is nothing but darkness -- except a pinprick of light around Pyongyang -- while the entire country of South Korea is ablaze in light, the light of freedom. 
 Korean freedom was won at a terrible cost -- tens of thousands of lives, including more than 33,000 Americans killed in action. Was it worth it? You bet. Just as it was worth it in Germany and France and Italy and in the Pacific in World War II. And just as it is worth it in Afghanistan and Iraq today. 
 Today, in a world of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and states that sponsor the former and pursue the latter, defending freedom means we must confront dangers before it is too late. In Iraq, for 12 years, through 17 United Nations Security Council resolutions, the world gave Saddam Hussein every opportunity to avoid war. He was being held to a simple standard: live up to your agreement at the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf war; disarm and prove you have done so. Instead of disarming -- as Kazakhstan, South Africa and Ukraine did, and as Libya is doing today -- Saddam Hussein chose deception and defiance.
 Repeatedly, he rejected those resolutions and he systematically deceived United Nations inspectors about his weapons and his intent. The world knew his record: he used chemical weapons against Iran and his own citizens; he invaded Iran and Kuwait; he launched ballistic missiles at Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain; and his troops repeatedly fired on American and British aircraft patrolling the no-flight zones. 
 Recognizing the threat, in September 2002 President Bush went to the United Nations, which gave Iraq still another ''final opportunity'' to disarm and to prove it had done so. The next month the president went to Congress, which voted to support the use of force if Iraq did not.
 And, when Saddam Hussein passed up that final opportunity, he was given a last chance to avoid war: 48 hours to leave the country. Only then, after every peaceful option had been exhausted, did the president and our coalition partners order the liberation of Iraq.
 Americans do not come easily to war, but neither do Americans take freedom lightly. But when freedom and self-government have taken root in Iraq, and that country becomes a force for good in the Middle East, the rightness of those efforts will be just as clear as it is today in Korea, Germany, Japan and Italy. 
 As the continuing terrorist violence in Iraq reminds us, the road to self-governance will be challenging. But the progress is impressive. Last week the Iraqi Governing Council unanimously signed an interim Constitution. It guarantees freedom of religion and expression; the right to assemble and to organize political parties; the right to vote; and the right to a fair, speedy and open trial. It prohibits discrimination based on gender, nationality and religion, as well as arbitrary arrest and detention. A year ago today, none of those protections could have been even imagined by the Iraqi people.
 Today, as we think about the tens of thousands of United States soldiers in Iraq -- and in Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world fighting the global war on terrorism -- we should say to all of them: ''You join a long line of generations of Americans who have fought freedom's fight. Thank you.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Files A Complaint Against China At the W.T.O.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
The United States filed the first case against China at the World Trade Organization on Thursday, contending that Beijing imposes unfair taxes on imported semiconductors.
 With China and its trade policies dominating much of the economic debate during this election year, the move was seen as a way for the administration to counter accusations from Democrats that it is not doing enough to protect American workers. 
 In Congressional testimony last week, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, warned that America would take its case against China to the W.T.O. because of the tax on semiconductors, which is as much as 14 percent higher on imported computer chips than on those designed or made in China, whether by domestic or foreign companies. 
 The administration had been pressed to file the case by the $70 billion semiconductor industry in the United States, which has complained that China's value-added tax discriminates against its products. 
 Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Mr. Zoellick traveled to China to convey the message that the United States was losing its patience with China's refusal to adapt more quickly to W.T.O. rules. But Chinese officials told a senior administration official last week that they would not lift the tax on foreign semiconductors, paving the way for the case filed on Thursday.
 Foreign imports account for 80 percent of China's integrated circuit market, which is valued at $19 billion -- the third largest in the world.
 But China's semiconductor industry is growing, and American manufacturers have warned that the value-added tax is a protectionist measure to nurture the Chinese industry by discriminating against foreign companies. 
 In the competitive semiconductor industry, a tax on foreign products can be the difference between winning or losing a sale, said Anne Craib, director of international trade at the Semiconductor Industry Association.
 ''We're hoping the discussions at the W.T.O. will yield the compromise we couldn't find without taking the decision,'' Ms. Craib said. ''This is an immediate problem with China trying to create a closed market to build up its own industry, and that has huge financial implications.''
 The chip industry employs 255,000 Americans, according to the association, and United States companies have a 50 percent share of the world market.
 Mr. Zoellick said last week that the administration was ''devoting more enforcement resources'' to China.
 ''While U.S. exports to China support more jobs for American workers, we face a number of persistent problems that must be resolved,'' he told Congress.
 Some Democratic lawmakers said the case filed on Thursday was politically motivated and would fail to answer criticism for the rising trade deficit with China.
 ''One case brought as a political talking point does not make up for the administration's failure to develop a China trade policy over the past three years,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and the ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee.
 Most trade experts said China would be unable to defend the tax before the W.T.O. 
 For Charlene Barshefsky, who was the trade representative during the Clinton administration, the case raised questions about the message China was sending about its commitment to international trade rules.
 ''This is disturbing,'' said Ms. Barshefsky, who helped negotiate China's entry into the W.T.O. ''I think that China is making a mistake in not moving to settle the semiconductor issue.''
 American companies are also worried that the tax is being used to persuade foreign companies to shift plants to China to avoid the extra tax.
 Several business groups applauded the move by the United States and said it was time that the administration took China to task for what they view as multiple examples of violations of global trade rules.
 ''This case isn't about semiconductors, as important a product as they are,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. ''It's about making sure that China doesn't discriminate against any U.S. manufactured goods.''
 The administration pointed to other instances where China did change course after complaints were lodged. In particular, China delayed new rules on soybeans, allowing the United States to export nearly $4 billion of the commodity over the last two years.

HEADLINE: Old-Fashioned Main Street Coming Right Up

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
Five years after building BelleFair in Rye Brook, N.Y., the developer Mitchell C. Hochberg is about to break ground in East Fishkill, in Dutchess County, on his second New Urbanism-style housing project. Instead of using a traditional suburban tract grid, the project will cluster some houses along an old-fashioned-style Main Street facing a village green, central meeting place and general store.
 Communities based on New Urbanism are intended to evoke a more neighborly way of life and strive to ''reduce the isolation often associated with traditional suburbia,'' explained Mr. Hochberg, president and chief executive of Spectrum Communities in Valhalla, in Westchester County. 
 The planning concept, which gained notice in the late 1980's and early 1990's, promotes open space by clustering development. It also reduces the reliance on automobiles by offering amenities like a food market and recreation on the site. Many of the homes have porches in the front and garages in the back, and sidewalks run throughout the project. The goal is to get people to walk or bicycle, not drive, to their destinations and to interact with neighbors. 
 At Spectrum's 500-acre development in East Fishkill, Four Corners, where construction is scheduled to begin this spring, there will be 264 houses in several clusters separated by wooded or open spaces.
 The houses will sit on quarter-acre to one-and-a-half-acre lots and range in size from 1,950 to 4,000 square feet with three to five bedrooms. The houses on the smaller lots will be priced in the mid-$300,000's, with the larger ones priced from the mid-$500,000's to $600,000 and up.
 The development's community center is to include a lounge and billiard room, a large multipurpose area for meetings and parties, a theater, catering kitchen, computer center, playroom and a gymnasium and physical fitness center. The monthly fee for the community center is expected to be about $200 a month, and there will be an additional fee for maintaining common areas of the project, including a five-acre park.
 In Rye Brook, BelleFair has 261 housing units, including some town houses. That development, which sold out quickly when it was built, also includes a large community center, a general store and a village green. 
 Based on current property values, the marketing of New Urbanism concepts at BelleFair appears to have been successful, observed Charlene Tobin, a sales agent with Julia B. Fee Real Estate in Rye. Resales do not languish on the market, she said, and BelleFair models that came on the market five years ago for prices in the $400,000's and $500,000's are now being snapped up for $800,000 to $1.2 million. ''Especially young couples from New York City love the sense of community that it offers,'' she said.
 Four Corners is being marketed to buyers who have been priced out of Westchester, where the median sales price for a single-family home at the end of 2003 was $545,500. By comparison, the median price of a single-family home in Dutchess at the end of last year was $339,900. 
 ''Westchester County is already full, and it's too expensive for many buyers,'' said Bill Lavery, regional vice president of Houlihan/Lawrence Lavery in Poughkeepsie. ''The next county to the north is Putnam, but it's small, and much of it is dominated by New York City watershed property that can't be developed. So Dutchess is the next stop, the first place outside of Manhattan where you can find a house for $300,000 without crossing a bridge over the Hudson River.''
 Mr. Hochberg predicted that many of Four Corners' new residents would be commuting to Manhattan, White Plains or Stamford. Travel time on the Metro-North Harlem Line from the Southeast station, for example, to Grand Central Terminal is about an hour and 20 minutes during peak commuter hours.
 The architect for Four Corners, Rick New of DTJ Design in Boulder, Colo., noted that while the idea of New Urbanism is becoming more mainstream, ''lots of times builders only use it as a marketing gimmick by just putting a garage in the back of a house and the porch in front.''
 In addition to including a village green, meeting house and general store at Four Corners, DTJ Design has mixed architectural styles and price ranges of the homes to attract a diversity of buyers, said Mr. New, who is the company's director of residential architecture.
 East Fishkill's town supervisor, Peter Idema III, noted that Spectrum's proposal fits in with the master plan for the 53-square-mile town, where more than half of the land is still undeveloped. The master plan seeks to contain sprawl with clustered development and provide public services in an efficient manner.

HEADLINE: Buyer of Rowland's Condo Says Broker Complained of Pressure

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN and WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 18 

 BODY:
A well-known antiques dealer who had agreed to buy a condominium from Gov. John G. Rowland told prosecutors that the businessman who was brokering the sale had said ''the seller was squeezing him for more money,'' a federal prosecutor who is investigating Mr. Rowland said on Thursday. 
 An assistant United States attorney, Nora R. Dannehy, made the statement during a hearing in Federal District Court here at which the antiques dealer, Wayne E. Pratt, pleaded guilty to one count of supplying false information about the condominium on his tax return, a misdemeanor. 
 Ms. Dannehy's comment came on a eventful day at the Capitol, where several legislators expressed fresh outrage at reports of the governor's actions.
 Their outrage had been stoked by news accounts on Thursday that Mr. Pratt, who appears frequently on the PBS television program ''Antiques Road Show,'' was prepared to testify that the businessman, Robert V. Matthews, had agreed to funnel money to Mr. Pratt to buy the condominium, and that the purchase was to be disguised as that of a costly antique.
 Companies controlled by Mr. Matthews, a businessman who has made millions on real estate and venture capital, have received millions in rent and economic development from the Rowland administration. 
 Also on Thursday, Stanley Twardy, the lawyer for an electrical contractor who pleaded guilty last year to tax fraud, said that his client, Kurt Claywell, was prepared to testify before the panel considering impeachment charges against Mr. Rowland that he had given thousands of dollars worth of Cuban cigars and champagne to the governor and his aides ''to expedite payments due him on state contracts.'' 
 Both Mr. Pratt and Mr. Claywell are cooperating with federal prosecutors as part of their investigation into corruption in state government, lawyers involved in the investigation say. Both men may be able to help prosecutors build their case that Rowland administration officials accepted bribes or gratuities in exchange for state business. 
 ''Every day, it's like drip, drip, drip,'' said Moira K. Lyons, a Democrat who is Speaker of the House in Connecticut. ''But this development, I think, it's like Niagara Falls. It's coming right at us.''
 Despite the disclosures, the governor's in-house counsel, Ross Garber, said: ''Still, no one has accused the governor of any illegal conduct. No one has accused the governor of abusing his office. No one has accused the governor of taking a bribe.'' 
 But Robert M. Ward, a Republican who serves as House minority leader, said that the arrangement over the condominium ''would appear to be laundering money,'' and he called on Mr. Rowland to explain that deal. 
 As for the cigars and champagne, the governor's private criminal lawyer, William F. Dow III, said Mr. Claywell ''certainly has an interesting background, to put it mildly, which would cause someone to examine his credibility.'' He was referring to Mr. Claywell's two convictions, for pension embezzlement in 2000 and tax fraud conviction last year.
 Mr. Matthews could also presumably be helpful to prosecutors if he decided to give information about his dealings with Mr. Rowland. Asked about Thursday's events, Mr. Matthews's lawyer, Hubert Santos, said he had no comment. 
 The tax charge Mr. Pratt pleaded guilty to before United States Magistrate Donna F. Martinez is punishable by up to a year in prison. His lawyer, Thomas E. Dwyer, Jr., has said he does not expect his client to serve time in prison. 
 Asked by Judge Martinez to explain what the government was prepared to argue if the case went to trial, Ms. Dannehy said that Mr. Pratt had been asked around April 1997 by his longtime business partner, whom the government described as ''Associate A,'' to buy Mr. Rowland's condominium.
 According to Ms. Dannehy, Associate A said that he ''should not be listed as the purchaser of the condominium'' and that he would ''make the defendant whole on the deal.'' 
 Before the purchase, Ms. Dannehy said, Associate A informed Mr. Pratt that ''the seller was squeezing him for more money, or words to that effect, and wanted an additional $5,000 for furniture, but that any furniture in the condominium was not worth anywhere near that amount.'' 
 She said that around May 1997 Associate A provided two checks ''primarily to cover the costs associated with the purchase of the condominium and the furniture.''
 Real estate records show that Mr. Pratt paid $68,500 for the condominium the following month, and sold it for $37,500 in December 1999. Ms. Dannehy said that Mr. Pratt never visited the condominium.
 The two men also met to settle up around February 2000, Ms. Dannehy told the court, at which time it was determined that Mr. Pratt needed $21,952 to be made whole. 
 She said that Associate A instructed Mr. Pratt to destroy documents related to the reconciliation payment, and that the two men agreed that the payment would ''be disguised as the purchase of an antique.'' 
 When it was his turn to speak, Mr. Pratt, who is 60, told the judge he agreed with everything that Ms. Dannehy said except for one quibble. He said that when he bought the property, he had no knowledge he was paying an above-market price.
 In response to her questions, Mr. Pratt admitted having submitted a tax return that was ''false as to a material matter'' in October 2000 because he claimed to have lost money on the condominium ''when I knew and agreed with someone else that I would not suffer any financial losses.'' 
 Outside the courtroom, Mr. Dwyer told reporters that Thursday's hearing was ''really not about Mr. Pratt.''
 ''It's about other individuals,'' Mr. Dwyer said. 
 Mr. Rowland told The Associated Press on Thursday: ''A lot of this has been said. I don't know any of the details but there are some issues at work. And again, these are some of the things that happen in life.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing Connecticut: Stamford: Officials Offer Tax Break To Clairol

BYLINE: By Colin Moynihan (NYT); Compiled by Ian Urbina

 BODY:
The mayor of Stamford, Dannel P. Malloy, said yesterday that he and state officials had offered a tax relief package to Clairol Inc. in hopes of dissuading the company from moving its manufacturing plant to Mexico. 
About six weeks ago, Proctor & Gamble, the owner of the plant, said they were considering moving the factory to Mexico, the mayor said. The plant has been in Stamford for about 50 years, the mayor said, and employs about 570 people. The Associated Press reported that Stamford legislators had asked the Department of Economic Community Development to offer up to $30 million in credits to the company. Colin Moynihan (NYT)

HEADLINE: 11 Charged With Stealing Prescription Drugs for Resale

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

DATELINE: PARAMUS, N.J., March 18 

 BODY:
A ring that stole millions of dollars worth of medications, including Zocor, Viagra and Claritin, and resold them on the black market was broken up this week with the arrests of 11 people, including five truck drivers, the authorities said Thursday.
 The Bergen County prosecutor, John L. Molinelli, said the thefts had cost major New Jersey pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, as well as wholesalers and consumers, millions of dollars over the last two years.
 ''These losses are passed down to consumers,'' Mr. Molinelli said as he announced the arrests. ''This is not a victimless crime.'' 
 He said investigators believed that most of the stolen medications wound up for sale on the Internet, to elderly people who have no prescription drug coverage, and possibly to nightclubs. In one case, Mr. Molinelli said, his detectives learned that some stolen Viagra reached a Florida nightspot and was sold to patrons along with the drug Ecstasy. ''I am sure every state in the nation has people buying off the black market,'' he said.
 Mr. Molinelli said his investigation was continuing and more arrests were likely. He said his detectives and investigators from two federal agencies, the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration, were focusing on identifying the final buyers of the stolen medications after they passed through a series of illicit middlemen. 
 Two of the suspects were arrested on Tuesday and nine others were apprehended at their homes throughout northern New Jersey on Thursday morning, starting at 5 a.m., Mr. Molinelli said. The arrests started after detectives learned of a transaction that involved the sale of 30 stolen cases of Zocor for $500,000, said Michael Mordaga, the chief of detectives in Mr. Molinelli's office. He declined to offer further details. 
 The suspects, all residents of New Jersey, were identified as Edward Sliker, 41, of Little Falls; Peter Cuccionilli, 45, of West Paterson; William T. Cairns, 40, and his wife, Christine Slaughter-Cairns, 38, of Wantage; Roy Jancio, 54, of Saddle Brook; Robert Horvot, 58, of Whippany; David Pinski, 65, of Fort Lee; Jose Hernandez, 50, of West New York; Ronald Tapp, 51, of Dover; Boguslaw Gumowski, 49, of Carlstadt; and George Donovan, 57, of Denville. 
 All 11 were charged with racketeering, theft, conspiracy and money laundering, Mr. Molinelli said.
 He said detectives had seized $1.1 million in illegal proceeds that had been deposited in a bank. Detectives also seized real estate, automobiles, furnishings and weapons bought with money from the sales, Mr. Molinelli said.
 The investigation started six months ago after a pharmaceutical wholesale company in Carlstadt, H.D. Smith, informed the authorities that several boxes of medications were missing from its shipments from pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Molinelli said. He said detectives eventually learned that truck drivers delivering the drugs had stolen several cartons from each shipment and sold them to a middleman, who sold them to other middlemen before they reached the retail level.

HEADLINE: East Side, West Side: 7 Line's Fate Pits City Against State

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
For two years, officials of the Bloomberg administration have said extending the No.7 subway line west to the Hudson River is central to their vision of a redeveloped West Side, including a new stadium for the Jets atop a rail bed, an expanded convention center and blocks of new office towers.
 The city has even taken the unusual step of offering to pay the $1.8 billion cost of the extension, which would be the biggest subway construction project in decades.
 In the last few weeks, however, New York State officials have begun to undercut the city's argument that the project is necessary. In a series of public appearances and conversations, state officials, along with the Jets, contend that the subway extension is not a critical component of the development of either the expanded Jacob K. Javits Convention Center or a 75,000-seat stadium for the Jets football team and possibly for the Olympics. 
 The state's position will not necessarily undermine the project, as the money is coming from city coffers. But the diverging positions illustrate the lingering tensions between two ostensible allies, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki, as they scramble for scarce funds for competing projects in the city. Each administration has a transportation agenda for Manhattan, but the state wants to tunnel under the East Side and the city wants to tunnel under the West Side. The gamesmanship taking place may determine which project gets primacy.
 The Bloomberg administration wants to extend the No. 7 line from Times Square underneath 41st Street west to 11th Avenue and then south to 34th Street, where it would build a grand station. It is desperate to begin construction of the subway extension and the stadium before the International Olympic Committee meets in July 2005 to select the site for the 2012 Summer Games. If the city wins its bid, the Jets stadium would double as the Olympic stadium, site of opening and closing ceremonies, as well as track and field events.
 Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, who fashioned the city's Olympic bid before entering city government, has long said that the city -- not the state agency that builds, finances and operates the subway trains and commuter lines -- would pay for the project from increased tax revenues on the West Side, where property values are expected to increase sharply. He wanted to avoid a bruising battle with proponents of projects like the $16.8 billion Second Avenue subway.
 ''The state and the M.T.A. are not financing the 7 line,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, playing down any suggestion that the city was at odds with the state. ''As we said all along, we didn't want to engage in a debate over competing transportation priorities. The West Side is unique in that the investment in infrastructure, most notably the extension of the No. 7 line, can be paid out of new tax revenues generated in the area. Those revenues wouldn't exist but for the investment in the infrastructure.''
 State officials prefer to spend scarce construction money on the $6.3 billion East Side Access project, which would allow Long Island Rail Road commuters to board their trains at Grand Central Terminal, a huge boon to Long Island residents who work on the East Side of Manhattan. They also want to pursue the long-delayed Second Avenue subway.
 Charles A. Gargano, the state's economic development chief, said the subway was tied to the city's rezoning of the Far West Side of Manhattan and the development of office towers and apartment houses over the next 30 years.
 ''The 7 line doesn't have to be part of this project,'' said Mr. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. ''It would be good, but it doesn't have to be part of expanding the Javits north or south, which includes the stadium.''
 The Jets, who want to begin construction of the $1.4 billion stadium early next year, seem to have taken a similar view.
 ''You don't need the subway, necessarily,'' L. Jay Cross, the Jets' president, said at a forum on Feb. 9. ''We can take advantage of the natural geography and get a foothold and get something going over there that helps propel other activities that hopefully follow.'' He said he was not opposed to the subway extension, but believed it would be most useful to spectators at Olympic events in the stadium. Jets fans, he said, would be more likely to travel to games via the Long Island Rail Road or New Jersey Transit.
 The Jets may be nervous about tying their fortunes to the fate of Mr. Doctoroff's West Side redevelopment and his financing plan for the subway. But the recent political shadowboxing seems to reflect long-running feuds between state and city officials over the financing for various projects, as well as a couple of new disputes related to the West Side. 
 Peter S. Kalikow, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees the subways, has long said that Mr. Doctoroff's No. 7 line extension was a nice project, but vowed that its financing would not come out of his agency's capital budget. More recently, the agency refused a city suggestion to move $600 million earmarked for the now-defunct La Guardia air-train project to the 7 line extension.
 Like administration Republicans, at least one powerful Albany Democrat -- Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly -- would prefer to focus on the Second Avenue subway, putting the 7 line at the bottom of his list of transportation priorities. 
 ''I'm not convinced we need a stadium on the West Side and as such I don't think the 7 is the kind of thing that is important to development,'' said Mr. Silver, who represents part of the East Side. ''At best, it deals with a minor portion of Manhattan. Second Avenue deals with a significant chunk of Manhattan and, ultimately, gives you the ability to go to Brooklyn and the Bronx. East Side access is contingent on a real Second Avenue subway.''
 But there may be a more immediate issue underlying the state's decision to go public with its criticism.
 Mr. Kalikow and the M.T.A. are in tough negotiations with Mr. Doctoroff over the West Side rail yards. As the deputy mayor was unveiling his financing plan for the West Side last month, Mr. Kalikow demanded that the M.T.A. be compensated for allowing the Jets to build a stadium over its rail yard. He wanted the ability to sell development rights from the rail yards to developers putting up residential buildings and office towers nearby. But those were the same development rights Mr. Doctoroff was proposing to sell as part of his plan to pay for the 7 line.
 The two sides have yet to come to terms.
 Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, said he finds the whole debate disturbing. Development would follow the subway line to the West Side and be a boon to both the Javits convention center and the proposed stadium, he said, because public transportation is now many blocks away. The city's current environmental review includes the subway. Without it, Mr. Yaro said, the Jets stadium is even more vulnerable to criticism that it will bring traffic jams and pollution.
 The Jets estimate that 70 percent of the team's fans will arrive at the stadium on public transportation. At Madison Square Garden, which sits over the Pennsylvania Station transit hub, an estimated 40 percent of the fans use public transit for Sunday night games.
 In any event, Mr. Yaro said the No. 7 line is part of the comprehensive redevelopment of the Far West Side.
 ''The goal of this whole thing was to create capacity for growth on the West Side,'' Mr. Yaro said. ''I think everyone agrees that the foundation for that are access and amenities. So the 7 is absolutely crucial to creating a new business district over there. If all we end up with is a football stadium and an expanded convention center, then we've missed out on the prime objective of this endeavor.''

HEADLINE: Pollution Dispute in Northwest Straddles the Border

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PREUSCH

DATELINE: TRAIL, British Columbia 

 BODY:
Eighty years ago, the smelter that anchors this company town was at the center of a dispute over whether a Canadian company could be held liable for environmental damage it caused in the United States.
 The United States was awarded damages in that case, which endures as a landmark in international environmental law. But now the same smelter is the focus of a new dispute between the two countries.
 The current impasse concerns nearly 20 million tons of industrial waste that the Trail smelter dumped into the Columbia River over the course of 100 years. The river carried much of it 10 miles across the border and into Washington State. 
 In December, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered the smelter's Canadian parent company, Teck Cominco, to study the health risks of contamination in the upper Columbia and assess cleanup options.
 The company responded by telling the agency that it had no obligation to honor United States law. The Canadian government also entered the fray with a formal diplomatic letter to the State Department asking that the environmental agency, in effect, back off.
 Canada, the letter said, is concerned that the agency's stance ''may set an unfortunate precedent by causing transboundary environmental liability cases to be initiated in both Canada and the United States.''
 Daniel Bodansky, a professor at the University of Georgia and an expert on international environmental law, said the earlier Trail smelter case might be the best framework for understanding the current one. Otherwise, he said, ''there's very little precedent for successful litigation of transboundary pollution cases.''
 In the earlier case, farmers in the United States concerned about their crops began complaining in the early 1920's about fumes drifting south from the Cominco smelter. The American government took up their cause, and the dispute was referred to the International Joint Commission, a rarely used arbitration panel, and then to a separate tribunal convened by the two countries. The United States was eventually awarded $428,000 in damages.
 More important, though, was the tribunal's finding that under international law no nation could allow activity in its territory that caused serious damage to another country.
 The current smelter conflict began when the Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in Seattle conducted a routine study of possible contamination of the Columbia.
 Last year, after a request by local Indian tribes, the office completed a partial survey of the upper Columbia, which for 135 miles upstream of the Grand Coulee Dam is a vast recreational area known as Lake Roosevelt, popular with boaters, anglers and campers. The survey found elevated levels of arsenic, lead, mercury and other contaminants in the lake, enough for it to qualify as a Superfund site.
 The study also determined that the Trail smelter was the ''primary source of contamination to the upper Columbia River,'' making the company potentially liable for cleanup and exposing it to lawsuits.
 One of Teck Cominco's United States subsidiaries, Teck Cominco American of Spokane, Wash., offered to pay for a $13 million study of the possible health risks posed by contamination in Lake Roosevelt if the agency would defer pursuing a cleanup under Superfund law.
 For a while it seemed that this offer might lead to a solution, but negotiations between the company and the agency's regional office broke down. The regional office, on the advice of government lawyers, then ordered Teck Cominco to begin planning for further studies and a possible cleanup.
 John Iani, the environmental agency's regional administrator, said the company's proposal did not meet the agency's standards for site testing and cleanup. Teck Cominco says the $13 million offer is still on the table.
 Doug Horswill, the company's senior vice president for environment and public affairs, said the agency had broken off discussions without explanation. ''We're not shirking our responsibilities whatsoever in this matter,'' he said.
 [Discussions are now under way in Washington and Ottawa involving the Environmental Protection Agency and the State and Justice Departments. Mr. Horswill said that any agreement would probably be between Canada and Teck Cominco, but that it would have to satisfy United States expectations that the lake be cleaned up.]
 A legacy of mistrust between residents of the upper Columbia and the smelter dates to the earlier quarrel, when farmers complained of crops being ruined by sulfur dioxide from the smelter's smokestacks. In the current case, some fear that the smelter may have created a lasting health problem for residents of the upper Columbia basin.
 Walking recently along a snow-crusted Columbia riverbank just south of the border, Robert Jackman of the local environmental group Citizens for a Clean Columbia picked up a handful of black, glassy sand by the water's edge and let it sift through his fingers.
 ''This whole area is slag,'' he said.
 Slag, a thick, grainy discharge, is a byproduct of smelting that contains lead, zinc, copper and other metals. From 1896 to 1995, operating within Canadian and provincial law, the smelter discharged nearly 20 million tons of it into the Columbia. Much of that made its way into the United States.
 Teck Cominco has maintained that the slag is inert, and sells it as an ingredient in concrete. The Environmental Protection Agency asserts that it could have a negative impact on wildlife and visitors at Lake Roosevelt.
 Mr. Jackman, 77, said the potential health risks along Lake Roosevelt had been ignored for too long. ''We feel that our health concerns are not being properly dealt with,'' he said.
 But some others in the basin fear that the agency is rushing forward without any evidence of the risks of contamination, and that an agency cleanup could devastate the local economy, which is heavily dependent on tourism.
 Merrill Ott, a Stevens County, Wash., commissioner, said it was wrong for the environmental agency to pursue Teck Cominco without being certain that the lake posed a health risk.
 ''People have been playing in the lake, people have been fishing in the lake, people have been swimming in the lake for 60 years,'' he said, ''and now all of a sudden there is a human health hazard?''

HEADLINE: Support for Chen Muted Among Taiwanese on Mainland

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, March 19 

 BODY:
There seem to be two kinds of people among the large community of Taiwanese in China these days: those who are openly willing to discuss Taiwan's election on Saturday and those whose sympathies make discretion the better part of valor.
 While there are surely supporters of the 53-year-old president, Chen Shui-bian, whom Beijing accuses of working for the island's independence, among the estimated one million Taiwanese in mainland China virtually none of them are willing to state their preference openly.
 Meanwhile, supporters of the opposition candidate, Lien Chan, 63, are relatively easy to spot. In recent weeks, they have been organizing pre-vote meetings aimed at recruiting travelers for charter flights home to increase voter participation. 
 Officially nonpartisan, the turn-out-the-vote effort is widely regarded here as not only an effort to help tilt the election in favor of Mr. Lien's Nationalist Party but also to earn some good will in Beijing, and perhaps political insurance for the approximately $35 billion of estimated Taiwanese investment in mainland China.
 Like people of German or Japanese extraction living in the United States during World War II, Taiwanese in China, most of whom live in or around this cosmopolitan city, are suspect outsiders. And in this case literally stateless, given that Beijing considers Taiwan an inalienable part of China.
 To be sure, there have been no mass arrests here, in part because Taiwanese capital and business savvy have been vital ingredients in China's impressive economic growth.
 Still, Taiwanese here do not travel on their own passports, have no diplomatic representation in case of legal difficulties or business disputes and cannot travel directly between the mainland and Taiwan, turning what would be a couple of hours' journey from Shanghai into an arduous daylong trip by way of Hong Kong or Macao. What is worse, Taiwanese business people say, is that they are sometimes subject to kidnappings, or arbitrary arrest, and are watched closely by China's intelligence agencies.
 Upon returning home to Taiwan, native Taiwanese do not necessarily find things any easier. Taiwan authorities sometimes extensively interview Taiwanese who live and work in China, and many returning Taiwanese also assume that they are being closely monitored by the island's intelligence services. Taiwanese who marry people from the mainland often find that getting paperwork for their spouses is difficult. Indeed, some say suspicion of Taiwanese who live on the mainland is as intense back home as it is on the mainland.
 ''When we go home, my daughter doesn't advertise the fact that we live in China,'' said a Taiwanese editor in Shanghai, whose magazine caters to the Taiwanese immigrant community here. ''She's even careful about the way she dresses, not to appear too Chinese.''
 Problems like these are only a foretaste of what many Taiwanese in China say they fear if on Saturday Mr. Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party should win the election and on the same day win a referendum, which asks whether Taiwan should increase defense spending to counter China's deployment of missiles against the island. Mr. Chen has increasingly and boldly flirted with asserting Taiwan's independence, which China has vowed to prevent by force, if necessary.
 Whatever their political sympathies, many Taiwanese in China hope that if Mr. Lien wins there will be an improvement in relations, including, perhaps, the establishment of direct transportation links for the first time. On the other hand, they say, a sharp escalation of tensions is probable in the case of a victory by Mr. Chen. 
 What is worse, Taiwanese business people here say, the economic dynamic between Taiwan and the mainland has changed significantly with China's stirring growth. Where China once depended on Taiwanese investment, increasingly nowadays it is the Taiwanese economy that is dependent on China for the manufacture and assembly of Taiwanese products or simply as a market.
 ''Taiwan needs the mainland nowadays,'' said Eric Teng, a prominent Taiwanese entrepreneur here. ''This is an absolute necessity. We can do research and development in Taiwan, but we need factories in China in order to remain a factor in the international economy.''
 With business interests on the line here, Mr. Teng has led the effort to encourage Taiwanese in China to return home to vote, and he has predicted that as many as 200,000 will do so. ''Each of these people could at least influence three Taiwanese votes, which means we could potentially have a huge influence.''
 Although the return-to-vote movement is officially neutral, Mr. Teng, when asked if he knew of any participants who were openly in favor of Mr. Chen, said: ''You never know what someone is feeling inside, but all of my Taiwanese friends are thinking of their well-being.''
 Some Taiwanese here, however, clearly resent what they see as Beijing's heavy-handedness toward the island and are as smitten with the idea of asserting a separate Taiwanese identity as Mr. Chen's backers in their homeland.

HEADLINE: 90-DAY STRATEGY BY BUSH'S AIDES TO DEFINE KERRY

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19 

 BODY:
President Bush's campaign is following an aggressive and precise 90-day media strategy to define Senator John Kerry as indecisive and lacking conviction, with a coordinated blitz of advertisements, speeches and sound bites, senior campaign advisers said this week.
 The goal, several campaign aides said, is to first strip Mr. Kerry of the positive image that he carried away from the Democratic primary contests and then to define him issue by issue in their own terms before the summer vacation season. The central thrusts will be national security and taxes, they said.
 The aides said the strategy was planned weeks ago in coordination with Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political aide, while Mr. Kerry was battling for his party's nomination. 
 The aides are following a tight timetable, they said, and they want to have defined Mr. Kerry on their terms between now and early June, when they expect voters to stop paying close attention to politics, at least for a time. In addition, Mr. Kerry will very likely have a much larger war chest with which to fight by then, reducing the effect of the Republican media blitz. 
 ''We just see this as the greatest window of opportunity, not that there won't be others,'' said Mark McKinnon, Mr. Bush's head media strategist. ''It's easiest to define somebody when they're ill-defined, and John Kerry's ill-defined.''
 The Bush aides pronounce their efforts a success so far, and point to polls showing that Mr. Kerry's ratings are dropping while Mr. Bush's are rising, a huge relief to a campaign that just a couple of weeks ago was criticized even by some Republicans as appearing flat-footed.
 ''If you look at the average balance of the public polls now, the president's either even, or up one or two points,'' said Matthew Dowd, the president's chief campaign strategist. ''And two weeks ago he was down three or four.'' 
 This early drive by the Bush campaign is in marked contrast to the approach of the Kerry organization, whose strategists say they believe the period before June is important but not as crucial as Mr. Bush's team asserts. Calling the Bush campaign's depictions of their candidate ''distortions,'' Mr. Kerry's strategists said the labels would not stick. Mr. Kerry is on vacation in Idaho this week. 
 ''The notion that you have a one-sided definition that takes hold five months before an election is ridiculous,'' said Bob Shrum, a senior advisor to Mr. Kerry. ''I don't think the Bush campaign's caricatures are going to stand up to the reality. Voters are smarter than that.''
 Mr. Shrum added that the campaign had months in which to define Mr. Kerry and critique Mr. Bush.
 The Republicans' move comes unusually early in the campaign season. That helps explain the intensive volley of accusations and counteraccusations between the campaigns that is more common in October than March, and which some members of both parties worry will turn off voters.
 But Mr. Bush's aides and strategists said that they had a unique opportunity to strike now, when polls show that most prospective voters do not have a good idea about who Mr. Kerry is -- and when Mr. Kerry is neither financially nor strategically equipped to respond in kind.
 So far, Mr. Bush's campaign has spent nearly $20 million in advertisements while Mr. Kerry has spent nearly $2 million on commercials since effectively clinching the nomination on March 2. Mr. Bush's advisers emphasized that they will by no means let up after June and still expect an extremely close fight in November. ''My guess is this race is going to be roughly tied for a while,'' Mr. Dowd said.
 The Bush campaign's strategy began in earnest last week, with its first confrontational advertisement, asserting that Mr. Kerry would raise taxes significantly and weaken the Patriot Act, ''used to arrest terrorists and protect America.'' It intensified this week with a new, multipronged effort to define Mr. Kerry as ''weak on defense'' and too unsteady to lead the nation in the war on terror. The campaign did that most precisely with a new advertisement broadcast in West Virginia on Tuesday highlighting Mr. Kerry's vote against the $87 billion package to support military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Vice President Dick Cheney reinforced it at a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday at which he said Mr. Kerry's record was not impressive ''for someone who aspires to become commander in chief in this time of testing for our country.'' Campaign aides and surrogates reinforced the message further in cable news interviews and in conference calls with reporters throughout the week. 
 The Republican National Committee, which works closely with the campaign on its message, fanned the flames with e-mail messages to reporters and supporters with the heading ''John Kerry International Man of Mystery,'' making fun of his statement that ''I've met more leaders'' who wanted him to win, and followed with an Internet advertisement on the same theme.
 White House and campaign officials were reluctant to disclose details of their plans for the weeks ahead. But several hinted that they would soon attack Mr. Kerry more forcefully on his tax policy, in part by discussing votes in his Senate career supporting taxes that had an effect on the middle class, not just the wealthy.
 Bush campaign officials said they were almost certain which themes they would be striking and what sorts of advertisements they would be showing at just about any given moment between now and June, even while acknowledging their plans could change on a dime. 
 ''The goal is right now,'' said a Bush adviser, ''while he's weak, while they're financially struggling, to strip him of all the good that somehow in my opinion erroneously got attached to him.''
 The advisers contended that that would be relatively easy to do because impressions of him are so ill-formed with many voters. ''He peels like an onion,'' said an associate of Mr. Bush. ''People aren't like, 'I really believe in this guy and I'm not willing to accept that information.' They accept it very easily. With some candidates there's a hard shell. With him there's a soft skin.''
 Polls show that many voters say they do not know enough about Mr. Kerry to form very strong opinions. In a New York Times/CBS poll taken March 10 to 14, more than 40 percent of Americans surveyed said they were either undecided or did not know enough about him when asked if they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Mr. Kerry. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
 Mr. Kerry's campaign acknowledges that he is nowhere near as well-known as is Mr. Bush. But it contended that was more of a problem for Mr. Bush, who they said was trying to turn the election into a referendum on Mr. Kerry rather than one about the president.
 ''The important thing to remember is that the American people see George Bush as the steward of a bad economy, the leader who led them to war under false pretenses,'' said Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kerry, striking two themes the campaign believes will be a strong suit against the president. 
 Kerry campaign officials said they would not be pulled into competing at Mr. Bush's pace, though they would fight back hard, as they have done with surrogates on cable news, e-mail messages to supporters and reporters, Web videos and, to a lesser extent for now, television commercials.
''We're going to fight back when we need to fight back,'' Mr. Shrum said, adding he did not believe the Bush campaign was as planned out as the Republicans claimed.
 Some Republicans said for the last couple of weeks at least, Mr. Kerry's campaign had seemed to be playing more defense than offense.
 ''The Bush people have stabilized the ballot,'' said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster whose firm, Public Opinion Strategies, is releasing a new survey of likely voters showing negative shifts in Mr. Kerry's favorability rating. 
 But other Republican and campaign officials said they expected Mr. Kerry to come back strongly after his vacation ends next week. And Mr. Dowd said these have been only two good weeks in a long campaign -- helped along by missteps from Mr. Kerry that the campaign cannot count on week to week. ''Most campaigns start with a plan,'' he said, ''very few end with a plan.''

HEADLINE: When a Dissertation Makes a Difference

BYLINE: By BROOKE KROEGER

 BODY:
For Devah Pager, a young sociologist from Honolulu, ''kulia i ka nu'u'' -- ''to strive for the summit'' -- means to do research that can influence policy, a realistic quest for her if the last few years are any indication.
 As a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, she studied the difficulties of former prisoners trying to find work and, in the process, came up with a disturbing finding: it is easier for a white person with a felony conviction to get a job than for a black person whose record is clean.
 Ms. Pager's study won the American Sociological Association's award for the best dissertation of the year in August, prompting a Wall Street Journal columnist to write about it. Howard Dean repeated her main finding in stump speeches and interviews throughout his glory days as the front-runner. 
 Then, addressing the overall problem convicted felons have re-entering the job market, President Bush announced in the State of the Union message a $300 million program to provide mentoring and help them get work. Jim Towey, the director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, said that Ms. Pager's study was one of the many sources of information that helped shape the administration's four-year plan.
 Ms. Pager, 32, is thrilled to see the issue receive national attention. More than half a million inmates will leave penal institutions this year, and ''the Administration is finally recognizing that the problems created by our incarceration policies can no longer be ignored,'' she said. Even if the promised amount is trivial, she said, the gesture is important symbolically.
 Conversation with Ms. Pager flows easily. Over a plate of pancakes, she brushes aside a crush of thick loose auburn curls to punctuate less serious points with flashes of the wide, arresting smile her colleagues say is emblematic. She is known for her good nature and charismatic style, but it is her research that has made her one of the most promising young sociologists around.
 Initially Ms. Pager's interest was race, stirred by her move from Hawaii to Los Angeles to attend the University of California. ''I was struck by the level of separation between racial groups on campus, throughout the city,'' she said. ''Race seemed to define space. Hawaii, by contrast, has the highest rate of intermarriage in the country. Growing up, every other person, it seemed, was hapa, or half, the term used to describe someone multiracial or mixed.'' She added, ''When you grow up with that being normal, everything else seems strange -- and wrong.''
 She completed a master's degree at Stanford University and a second master's at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, her father's native country. He is a professor of computer science. Her mother, a pediatrician, was born in Australia, making Ms. Pager something of a hapa herself, a Jewish one. A one-year visiting professorship at the University of Hawaii took Ms. Pager's parents to Honolulu from London before she was born. They never left.
 ''Hawaii is an amazing place to grow up,'' Ms. Pager said. ''It's got a small-town community feeling, despite the fact that Honolulu is a city of about a million people.''
 Though her family is ''solidly upper middle class,'' she said, her parents obliged her and her two older brothers to work to pay part of their college expenses. ''I resented it initially,'' she said, ''but in fact it ended up being a great way for me to get involved in things I wouldn't have been involved with otherwise.''
 The interest in released prisoners arose while she was studying for her doctorate in Madison, Wis. She organized a karaoke night for the sociology department (''I'm a diva,'' she wrote in an e-mail message, playing off the pronunciation of her given name. ''I love to sing.''), and she volunteered for an organization that provides services and shelter to homeless men. There she met many black men with prison records. ''It was a nice break to get out and do some direct service,'' she said. She spent time with the men, distributed their mail and made herself available ''as a resource, to allow them to unload.'' Those who had served jail time often talked about how it complicated the job search. ''That was one of the first things that clued me into what an immutable barrier it was standing in their way,'' she said.
 At about this time Human Rights Watch and the Sentencing Project reported that in seven states felony convictions had permanently disenfranchised one in four African-American men. An innovative but difficult research plan began to take shape.
 Both of her main advisers, Robert M. Hauser and Erik Olin Wright, tried to dissuade her, gently suggesting how hard it is for graduate students to obtain financial support, manage complicated field work and end up with meaningful results.
 ''She was undaunted,'' Mr. Wright said. ''Her pluckiness is part of what makes her successful. She knew she could do it.''
 To isolate the effect of a criminal record on the job search, Ms. Pager sent pairs of young, well-groomed, well-spoken college men with identical resumes to apply for 350 advertised entry-level jobs in Milwaukee. The only difference was that one said he had served an 18-month prison sentence for cocaine possession. Two teams were black, two white.
 A telephone survey of the same employers followed. For her black testers, the callback rate was 5 percent if they had a criminal record and 14 percent if they did not. For whites, it was 17 percent with a criminal record and 34 percent without.
 ''I expected there to be an effect of race, but I did not expect it to swamp the results as it did,'' Ms. Pager said. ''It really was a surprise.''
 Jeff Manza, a colleague at Northwestern University, where she teaches, said, ''Devah's work demonstrates in a new and convincing way the extent to which the 'second chance' that Bush talks about runs headlong into the realities of race and the fear of crime and criminals.''
 Similarly, Reginald Wilkinson, Ohio's top corrections official and the president of the Association of State Correctional Administrators, was impressed by her findings and methodology. ''In my estimation, we can't eliminate the race question when we're talking about re-entry,'' he said. ''I think what Professor Pager has done is raise consciousness about this.''
 More reserved was James J. Heckman of the University of Chicago, a Nobel laureate in economics. In a telephone interview, he said Ms. Pager's findings were important but not surprising. Mr. Heckman, who has written extensive critiques of similarly designed studies, said that she had created ''a very clean study'' of the impact of a criminal record on job seekers in general, but that he did not buy the race findings.
 ''I believe there is serious reason for caution here,'' he said. ''The comparison across the black and white pairs is just not strong because it's not an experimental design and the samples are just too small.''
 Ms. Pager is replicating her research on a grander scale with one of the field's leading experts, Bruce Western of Princeton University, where she will join the sociology faculty this fall.
 The new study is another chance to further document the effects of race and imprisonment, another chance at ''kulia i ka nu'u.''

LENGTH: 1896 words

HEADLINE: Hussein's Fall Leads Syrians To Test Government Limits

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, March 19 

 BODY:
A year ago, it would have been inconceivable for a citizen of Syria, run by the Baath Party of President Bashar al-Assad, to make a documentary film with the working title, ''Fifteen Reasons Why I Hate the Baath.'' 
 Yet watching the overthrow of Saddam Hussein across the border in Iraq prompted Omar Amiralay to do just that. ''It gave me the courage to do it,'' he said.
 ''When you see one of the two Baath parties broken, collapsing, you can only hope that it will be the turn of the Syrian Baath next,'' he said. He has just completed the film, now titled, ''A Flood in Baath Country,'' for a European arts channel, saying, ''The myth of having to live under despots for eternity collapsed.'' 
 When the Bush administration toppled the Baghdad government, it announced that it wanted to establish a democratic, free-market Iraq that would prove a contagious model for the region. The bloodshed there makes that a distant prospect, yet the very act of humiliating the worst Arab tyrant spawned a sort of ''what if'' process in Syria and across the region.
 The Syrian Baath Party remains firmly in control, ruling through emergency laws that basically suspend all civil rights. The government says the laws are necessary as long as Israel occupies the Golan Heights, 40 miles from Damascus, and the two nations remain at war. 
 Yet subtle changes have begun, even if they amount to tiny fissures in a repressive state. Some Syrians are testing the limits, openly questioning government doctrine and challenging state oppression. 
 Syrians who oppose the government do so with some trepidation because it used ferocious violence in the past to silence any challenge. Yet the fall of Mr. Hussein changed something inside people. 
 ''I think the image, the sense of terror, has evaporated,'' said Mr. Amiralay, the filmmaker.
 On March 8, for instance, about 25 protesters demanding that repressive laws be lifted tried to demonstrate outside Parliament. Security forces squashed the sit-in as it started, but the event would have been unthinkable before the Iraq war.
 People here do not know what previously locked doors they can push open, but they are trying to find out.
 Take Mr. Amiralay. In 1970, he returned to Syria after a few years of graduate studies in Paris. Swept up in the pan-Arab nationalism spouted by Syrian leaders and enthralled with the economic development spurred by the Baath Party, his first documentary was a 16-minute, Soviet-style tribute to the Euphrates River dam that created Lake Assad.
 Years later, he said, he wanted to atone, not least because many dams from that era developed dangerous cracks, and one burst in 2002 with disastrous results. He wanted to expose government propaganda for what it is.
 His new film shows both elementary school students and teachers in Al Mashi, a tiny village 250 miles northeast of Damascus, shouting songs in praise of the president and endlessly mouthing Baath slogans. Their eyes dart about and their heads swivel periodically as they falter over a word, fearful they will be accused of diverting from the accepted vocabulary. 
 Mr. Amiralay said students raised with such an empty education would prove as unlikely to defend their system as the Iraqis. Virtually no one wants an American intervention here. But the problem in Syria and across the region, activists like Mr. Amiralay say, is that no Arab government allows its people real power to press for change. ''Change is something effected by the palace, not the society,'' as he puts it. 
 Yet the changes here are also reflected in the words of Mahdi Dakhlalah, the 56-year-old editor of the official Baath newspaper. A bald, burly man, Mr. Dakhlalah sat recently in his sprawling office on the sixth floor of the kind of boxy, Stalinist buildings that house most government bureaus in Damascus, ticking off recent reforms.
 Last month the government eliminated emergency economic courts, often used to jail opposition businessmen, he pointed out. It has allowed four private universities to open, and two private banks started accepting deposits in January, although they cannot deal in foreign exchange.
 A number of experts believe that the young President Assad is searching for a way to make Syria more like Jordan or Egypt. 
 On the face of it, those countries have democratic institutions like a parliament and a fairly free press, but anyone who becomes too vocal in criticizing the man behind the palace walls gets a visit from the secret police.
 Even the president's many supporters concede that change here comes at a glacial pace. Article 8 of the Constitution enshrines the central role of the Baath Party, but many see the government as fishing for ways to jettison that provision without seeming to respond to American pressure. 
 In December, the party mailed out complicated questionnaires to the 500,000 of its nearly two million members. It asked many ideological questions like, ''Is democracy compatible with socialism?'' 
 Critics, even some within the Baath, call the questionnaire evidence of everything backward about the party, too creaky to know how to change. ''Who in their right mind believes anyone in the government is going to read 500,000 written responses?'' a young party economist said. 
 Mr. Dakhlalah says, ''The palace, those in authority, all want change, but the lower ranks do not.'' 
 The unanswerable question, of course, is how much the conversations in government offices or in the smoky, crowded cafes of downtown Damascus truly reflect sentiment among all 17 million Syrians.
 Nor are these the first predictions of sweeping change in the region. In the early 1990's, when the Soviet Union and its satellites collapsed, many asked how long the Middle East police states modeled on them could last. The question once prompted a senior adviser to the President Hafez al-Assad -- the late father of the current president -- to throw a reporter out of his office. And in 2000, when the senior Mr. Assad died and his son took over, there were widespread predictions of a loosening. For a short while, there was a shift, but it did not last.
 Senior Syrian officials react now with more tact if no less vehemence when anyone compares them to the Baath Party next door; the two parties broke apart in 1966. In both cases, the Baath served as the vehicle for a small minority to grab power: Sunni Muslims, many of them from Mr. Hussein's tribe, in Iraq, and Alawites in Syria. The palace and its competing secret police agencies ruled both countries, brooking no competition and maintaining a tight hand over the economy.
 Here, Alawite domination of the secret police is such that a Syrian who falls afoul of them on the street will often switch to Alawite-accented Arabic in hopes of gaining some leniency.
 Anwar al-Bounni, a 45-year-old human rights lawyer, also senses shifts rippling through the country. Sitting at his desk in Damascus one recent night, he was fielding calls from Kurds across northern Syria reporting deadly clashes with government forces. Violence in the Kurdish areas makes the government nervous, fearful that Iraq's problems are spilling across the border.
 Mr. Bounni has defended several Kurds arrested in high-profile cases for demanding greater minority rights. He recently received two summonses on the same day -- signing the small paper chits that arrived at his cramped, low-ceilinged office by special messenger -- from Military Intelligence and State Security. Both are among some 11 overlapping secret police organizations that Syrians loathe and fear. 
 Yet even the police act somewhat differently now. 
 The visit to State Security went well -- ''friendly,'' Mr. Bounni called it, merely an hourlong conversation about contacts between the Human Rights Association in Syria and similar foreign groups.
 Military Intelligence was different. On Day 1, he sat alone in a room for the entire day. On Day 2, he sat in the waiting room of a colonel, but no one spoke to him, and he got nothing to drink. On Day 3, the colonel summoned him into his office.
 ''He told me that I speak too harshly against the government, that they could put me in jail any time if I continued or could even resort to 'other means,' '' Mr. Bounni, a slight man with receding black hair who chain-smokes, said with a grin. ''The officer kept telling me that the country is changing, that reforms are on the way and that I had to wait.'' 
 Previously, Mr. Bounni noted, he would have been taken directly to jail for publicly demanding real political parties, a free press, fair trials or other civil liberties. The arresting officers would also have probably knocked him around, not treated him with a certain offhand civility.
 ''If the regime left today, there would be no one to run this country,'' he said. ''There has been no political life for 40 years,'' he added, noting that the chaos in Iraq is largely the result of a similar void. 
 Opposition groups have no platform -- no access to television, radio or the newspapers -- to address the public, so they spend their time petitioning the very government they want to change.
 ''We have to push them to allow the society to breathe, to make it more alive,'' he said.
 The hallmarks of the old have ebbed, not disappeared. The Lawyers Syndicate of Damascus is seeking to disbar Mr. Bounni for helping to defend 10 prominent dissidents jailed in 2002. Government critics are often accused of being American agents.
 When he sits alone for hour after hour in those interrogation rooms, fear creeps back.
 ''I think maybe some in the regime want to return to those days; they are not comfortable that people speak out,'' he said. ''I think they know the game is finished, at least I hope it is finished.''
 Others, some from surprising quarters, say similar things. Talk of reform can even be heard from radical breakaway Palestinian factions, still based here despite government denials. Most of the Palestinian offices are shuttered, their leaders asked to remain silent or to move. 
 One still operating is the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestinian, which was removed from the State Department list of terrorist organizations in 1999.
 Nayef Hawatmeh, the group's leader and a gray-haired contemporary of Yasir Arafat, holds court in a shabby basement office. The front has played a minor role in Palestinian politics and in the fighting with Israel in recent years, claiming responsibility for some small-scale shooting attacks. Mr. Hawatmeh criticizes suicide bombings inside Israel.
 If the region is full of despots, he points out, it is because the West long supported them. In the case of the Palestinians, the United States bet completely on Mr. Arafat while allowing him to build yet another totalitarian system, rather than promising a democratic state that all Palestinians would have supported wholeheartedly.
 The Palestinian violence would dwindle, Mr. Hawatmeh said, if the United States forced a specific end to the Israeli occupation. Then Mr. Hawatmeh, aging anti-imperialist, a man who has benefited from Syrian hospitality for years, edges perilously close to sounding like a Bush administration spokesman.
 ''The Iraqis can see what they are going to get, what they struggled for during all the time under Saddam,'' Mr. Hawatmeh said. ''The Iraqi people can see that the American occupation is not forever and reform will come in time.''

HEADLINE: After 19 Years Voting in Senate, the Kerry of Today Is Far From the Kerry of 1985

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19 

 BODY:
When he first entered the Senate, in 1985, John Kerry was a proponent of a nuclear arms freeze and he joined other liberal Democrats in challenging numerous elements of President Ronald Reagan's military expansion. He called the build-up unnecessary and said some of the weapons systems were useless.
 Mr. Reagan's military expansion was subsequently credited for helping hasten the collapse of the Soviet Union. And with the cold war ending, the world was suddenly a different place. The next president, George Bush, also a Republican, and his secretary of defense, Dick Cheney, began drawing down the armed forces and scaling back weapons systems, reaping the benefits of what was referred to as the peace dividend.
 Mr. Kerry, like most of his colleagues, went along. But he also occasionally went further than the majority of his party. 
 In 1994 he proposed some cuts in military programs and intelligence services that even many Democrats rejected. Senator Dennis DeConcini, the Arizona Democrat who then headed the intelligence committee, had said, earlier cuts were ''as deep as the intelligence community can withstand during its post-cold-war transition.''
 Now, with the presidential campaign being waged on new terrain brought about by the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the war in Iraq, Mr. Bush is making his leadership in fighting terrorism the centerpiece of his re-election effort. And his campaign is pointing to Mr. Kerry's long voting record on military matters to portray him as ''wrong on defense''and unfit to be commander in chief. 
 Mr. Cheney, now the vice president, said in a speech on Wednesday that Mr. Kerry's record ''has given us ample doubts about his judgment and the attitude he brings to bear on vital issues of national security.''
 Mr. Kerry's advisers said that the Bush campaign was distorting the senator's votes and taking them out of context. But even Mr. Kerry has disavowed some of his earlier stances and has moved to embrace a more vigorous intelligence operation.
 He told The Boston Globe last year that some of his earlier positions were ''ill advised, and I think some of them are stupid in the context of the world we find ourselves in right now and the things that I've learned since then.''
 In the 1990's Mr. Kerry voted against three defense authorization bills -- in 1991, 1996 and 1997. He opposed the bill in 1991, he said, because it did not reflect changes in the post-cold-war world. He said the other bills were loaded with pork-barrel spending, and he favored transferring the money to domestic programs.
 Since the late 1990's Mr. Kerry's votes on the military and intelligence have fallen more in the mainstream. He has voted to increase intelligence funding by 50 percent since 1996 and he has supported every defense authorization bill under President Bush, for a total of $1.1 trillion in spending, with the exception of the $87 billion supplemental appropriation for rebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2002, he voted for the largest increase in military spending since the 1980's. Of the 19 defense authorization bills he has voted on during his Senate career, he supported 16.
 While Republicans accuse him of voting to eliminate numerous weapons programs, by the end of 19 years in the Senate Mr. Kerry also voted for many to be continued.
 ''When U.S. military spending was being driven by the agendas of defense contractors and right-wing ideologues, I stood up to oppose their excesses,'' Mr. Kerry said in a written statement to The New York Times. ''But I have always fought to ensure America has the strongest military in the world.''
 Given his votes through the mid-1990's, analysts place him at the liberal end of the spectrum. If the late Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, represented zero, the most liberal end, and Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, was 100, the most conservative end, Senator Kerry might fall ''in the 10 to 20 range,'' said John David Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World, a group that lobbies for arms control.
 After he returned from the Vietnam War with a Silver Star and three Purple Hearts and joined the antiwar movement, Mr. Kerry was often skeptical of military spending, finding it bloated with pet projects or weapons systems that he said he thought would not work or were superfluous.
 He campaigned for the Senate in 1984 on a proposal to cut at least $54 billion from Mr. Reagan's $289 billion military spending proposal for 1985 by eliminating 27 weapons systems and making reductions in 18 others. Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst at the Brookings Institution, said that Mr. Kerry was part of a school of thought that opposed making certain nuclear weapons bigger or smarter, seeing no point in increasing the number of times ''you could make the rubble bounce.''
 In 1990 he ran for re-election on the slogan ''Once you've seen war, you never stop fighting for peace,'' and in 1991 voted against the first Gulf war. He said economic sanctions should have been given more time to work, and he read on the Senate floor from ''Johnny Got His Gun,'' the antiwar novel about a World War I veteran who lost all his limbs.
 Mr. Kerry voted to cut funding for the B-2 stealth bomber, and the first President Bush halted the program in 1992. (Twenty-one of the bombers were completed and eventually converted to carry conventional bombs, not nuclear weapons, and some were used in Iraq.) He voted to limit funding for Mr. Reagan's missile defense program because he said he thought it would not work. But in 1999 he voted -- with most of the Senate -- to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as it was technically feasible.
 Steven Aftergood, an intelligence policy analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, said that in the 1990's there was ''an absence of clarity as to the proper scale and orientation of the military intelligence complex.''
 ''With the end of the cold war,'' Mr. Aftergood said, ''the ground fell out beneath the whole policy apparatus, and all kinds of things seemed up for grabs.''
 For a time, after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, many Republicans and Democrats alike believed that the reduction of tensions allowed a transformation of the military. As Mr. Cheney told the Senate Armed Services Committee in 1992: ''Over all, since I've been secretary, we will have taken the five-year defense program down by well over $300 billion. That's the peace dividend.''
 In 1994, Mr. Kerry proposed a $45 billion cut in the federal budget for the next five years, with the goal of reducing the deficit. Had it passed, his measure would have cut $1 billion from the nation's intelligence services and $3 billion in military programs.
 Mr. Kerry, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, had said those cuts would reduce the deficit ''merely by cutting programs that are clearly pork-barrel boondoggles.'' In addition, he said with new threats emerging in terrorism and narcotics, his instinct was to favor investing in human intelligence rather than hardware like satellites.
 Still, his proposal was killed, 75 to 20. While many senators wanted to keep pet projects, others argued that his cuts went too deep. Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the appropriations committee, urged the Senate to reject the measure, saying, ''We have already cut defense spending drastically'' and cutting another $4 billion ''is simply unwise and insupportable.''
 President Bush has said that another Kerry proposal from 1995 -- to cut $1.5 billion from the intelligence budget, or $300 million each year for five years -- was a plan to ''gut'' the intelligence services and was so ''deeply irresponsible'' that no senator joined Mr. Kerry in sponsoring it.
 Jonathan Wiener, a long-time Kerry aide and adviser on national security, said no one co-sponsored Mr. Kerry's bill because it was superceded by a similar bill offered that same day by Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who was chairman of the intelligence committee. Mr. Specter's measure passed by voice vote.
 ''This wasn't even controversial,'' Mr. Wiener said.
 Republican officials counter that the Kerry camp is rewriting history. They said the Kerry and Specter measures had two different purposes. The Specter legislation cut money from the National Reconnaissance Office, which oversees spy satellites, because it had unspent money set aside in a secret fund.
 Mr. Kerry's measure was titled ''Responsible Deficit Reduction Act of 1995,'' reflecting his goal of reducing the deficit by cutting both military and nonmilitary spending. It did not mention the National Reconnaissance Office.
 Rand Beers, the Kerry campaign's foreign policy adviser, said Mr. Kerry did not mention the reconnaissance office because the committee's deliberations were supposed to be classified. But, Mr. Beers said, he was ''going after'' the same office.
 More recently, Mr. Bush has ridiculed Mr. Kerry for initially supporting the use of force in Iraq, then campaigning against it.
 In the heat of the Democratic primaries this year, after Howard Dean, the antiwar candidate, criticized his vote, Mr. Kerry said that he had merely voted for the president to ''threaten'' the use of force and that he had believed Mr. Bush would build an international coalition and go to war only as a last resort.
 The Bush campaign is also emphasizing Mr. Kerry's subsequent vote against $87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan and for more equipment for the troops.
 Explaining his vote at the time, Mr. Kerry said: ''The best way to support our troops and take the target off their backs is with a real strategy to win the peace in Iraq -- not by throwing $87 billion at George Bush's failed policies.''
 He also said he wanted that $87 billion to come from rescinding part of Mr. Bush's tax cut and he voted for an amendment to do that. But it was rejected, so Mr. Kerry voted against the final measure.
 In a scathing television commercial, the Bush campaign singles out items from that one vote to suggest that Mr. Kerry voted ''no'' several times against specific outlays like ''funding our soldiers,'' ''body armor for troops in combat'' and ''higher combat pay.'' The Bush campaign then remade the commercial and began running it on Thursday to further deride Mr. Kerry. It pointed to his recent explanation that ''I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.'' 
 Senator Kyl, a Republican who served with Mr. Kerry on the intelligence committee and frequently disagreed with him, said in an interview that he found that vote ''the most disturbing of all.''
 ''Kerry is trying to parse this very finely, sort of like a lawyer in a legal brief,'' Mr. Kyl said.
 Mr. O'Hanlon, of Brookings, said of Mr. Kerry's record, ''On balance I would say that voting for 16 of 19 authorization bills is a pretty good defense against the charges that Bush is leveling, but he might be in a stronger position if at some point he'd laid out, in forward-looking terms, what he was for rather than what he was against.''


CORRECTION-DATE: March 25, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about John Kerry's voting record in the Senate misspelled the surname of a Washington lawyer and former Kerry aide who described the senator's complexity as right for the times. He is Jonathan Winer, not Wiener.
 An article on March 6 about Senator Kerry's positions on divisive campaign issues referred incorrectly to a comment cited by Mr. Winer. He said Mr. Kerry quoted the writer Andre Gide in saying, ''Don't try to understand me too quickly'' -- not ''Don't try to understand me too much.''

HEADLINE: The Cold Facts Of Officialdom, Albany-Style

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
BOOTS; check. Gloves; check. Hat; check. Fifty cents in case of emergency; check. Overcoat. Overcoat.
 Overcoat? 
 Overcoat; missing. We've got a problem.
 Depending on where you were yesterday morning, you were either pelted with snowflakes the size of Hostess Sno Balls, or spritzed by a cold rain trying its best to be snow, but unable to summon the will. 
 Either way, the day clearly required an overcoat. But what does one do if the overcoat is missing, or lacking a few buttons, or so threadbare that it evokes memories of bread lines? To whom does one turn?
 Why, the Overcoat Development Corporation, of course. Conveniently located at 633 Third Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, the Overcoat Development Corporation is, no joke, a state entity, a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation. 
 Wow, we thought. That's public service.
 So we donned a lesser coat, a coat that wasn't even half the coat that the missing overcoat was, and began to walk across town in the morning's unforgiving weather to inquire about the latest in overcoat research and development. Maybe we'll buy something off the rack. Better yet, maybe we'll get a sneak preview of the technologically advanced models for next winter. Anticipation built with each step.
 And so did our overcoat envy. Everywhere we looked, we saw someone happily cocooned in an overcoat. The doorman in front of Cipriani on 42nd Street wore a black overcoat so large that he looked like a rolled-up carpet. The doormen at the Grand Hyatt hotel wore green-and-gold overcoats that could have come from ''The Wizard of Oz'' remainder bin. A passer-by, holding aloft an umbrella for a lady friend, sported an overcoat that was the butterscotch color of Winnie-the-Pooh's fur.
 Not exactly our style; we're more of an Eeyore. But still, he had an overcoat, and we did not. The wind kicked up, and a slushy substance that was not quite snow, not quite rain, fell from the sky. We started to turn up the collar of our overcoat, only to be reminded that we had neither. 
 Oh, the humanity. Must. Get. To. Overcoat Development Corporation.
 We finally made it to 633 Third Avenue, where Gov. George E. Pataki and several state agencies have offices. We approached a guard and asked for the Overcoat Development Corporation, please.
 ''Never heard of it,'' he said, looking us up and down, as if measuring the risk we posed to homeland security. He directed us to a house phone, from which we called the Empire State Development Corporation and asked again for the, wink-wink, O.D.C.
 A state official promised to get back to us, and hung up. Moments later we were standing again in the falling slush, without an overcoat, without a clue. 
 Hypothermia can play tricks on the mind. Suddenly, we wondered: Why would the state government have something called the Overcoat Development Corporation? 
 Maybe Governor Pataki is a micromanager whose cabinet meetings include updates from the public safety commissioner, the health commissioner, and the commissioner for overcoat development. ''Well, Mr. Muckle,'' he asks. ''How's that wool-blend matter we discussed last week?''
 ''I think we have it under control, sir,'' Mr. Muckle answers. ''But you and I need to discuss it further. In private.''
 No, no. It must go deeper than that. The name -- the Overcoat Development Corporation -- is almost ingeniously bland, which means that it is clearly a front for some international covert operation to accumulate black helicopters and other neat stuff. Mr. Pataki's public persona as a stiff public speaker is probably part of the ruse. Actually possessed of a Bond-like suavity, he is The Man from O.D.C.
 JUST as we were piecing things together, someone from state government called back with the ''official'' story:
 The corporation is the remnant of an economic-incentive effort that offered a favorable lease on a building in Amsterdam, N.Y., to lure a men's outerwear company from Indiana in 1986. The company eventually folded, but the O.D.C. continued to exist because of a long-term lease it signed with another company to fulfill property-tax obligations.
 ''It's basically a dormant corporation,'' the state official explained.
 Right. And the state Insurance Department is just interested in ''insurance.''
 Any fool could look at the other tenants of 633 Third Avenue and see the connection. The Consulate General of Switzerland. China Airlines. The Fresh Air Fund. And, of course, the Overcoat Development Corporation. Don't you see how they all fit together? Don't you see?
 Boy, it's cold outside.

HEADLINE: Dow Skids Again as Anxious Investors Cash In Options

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street ended a volatile week with another turbulent session yesterday as investors cashed in options and futures contracts, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 100 points. All three major gauges posted losses for a second consecutive week.
 Trading was feverish because of what is known as quadruple witching -- the expiration of all index and equity options and futures contracts -- and investors took the opportunity to adjust their portfolios and move into more defensive stocks. Technology shares, led by a sharp drop in semiconductors, suffered the biggest declines. 
 ''A lot of this weakness is due to options activity,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke. ''And as you look ahead over the next few weeks, there's a big tug of war between those who see positives in the market and those who don't. When that happens, you can expect to drift a little lower.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 109.18 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,186.60.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.54 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,109.78, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 21.97 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,940.47.
 For the week, the Dow lost 53.48 points, or 0.5 percent; the S.&P. 500 lost 10.79 points, or 1 percent; and the Nasdaq fell 44.26 points, or 2.2 percent.
 Reports that Al Qaeda's No.2 leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, might be surrounded by Pakistani troops kept the market on edge, as traders were concerned that his capture might lead to retaliatory terrorist strikes.
 Analysts said the next jobs report, expected in two weeks, could bolster shares somewhat, but most analysts agree there is very little that will move the market much higher in the near future. Stocks have been falling since mid-February on rising investor anxiety over the lack of job creation, a critical factor if the economic recovery is going to gain momentum.
 The renewed terrorist activity, including last week's bombing of trains in Madrid, has added to the market's uneasiness and raised the prospect of a prolonged slump on Wall Street.
 ''This has been more of a lengthy correction than we might normally see,'' said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist for the PNC Financial Services Group in Philadelphia. ''It's really been dragged out because of the heightened terrorist activity, high oil prices and low job growth. That keeps everybody on the sidelines.''
 Even first-quarter earnings reports, starting next month, may not be enough to shake the market out of the doldrums.
 ''I think this is going to be symptomatic of the kind of market we can expect for a while,'' said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist for CIBC World Markets. ''I think we're still in a corrective phase, and I see us trading in this range through the first half of this year.''
 Merger speculation and positive earnings did little to quell the market. Kmart rose $1.07, to $38.13, after speculation that Sears, Roebuck would make a bid for the company, which recently emerged from bankruptcy protection. Sears fell $1.08, to $43.40.
 Sprint slipped 1 cent, to $17.65, after a Wall Street Journal report noted the company is now free to be acquired and could actively pursue suitors under the deal with BellSouth that sent Gary Forsee to Sprint as chief executive a year ago. Possible buyers include Vodafone of Britain and Verizon Communications. 
 Nike reported a 61 percent jump in third-quarter earnings; its shares were up 5 cents at $76.87.
 The software maker Adobe Systems jumped $3.58, to $39.85, as it doubled its income in the latest quarter, soundly beating Wall Street estimates.
 Not all the earnings news was good, however. 3Com, the computer network equipment maker, slipped 37 cents, to $6.69, after reporting a wider-than-expected loss for the quarter.
 Treasury prices fell yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32, to a price of 101 28/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.77 percent from 3.75 percent on Thursday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 3/32, to 110 6/32. The bond's yield rose to 4.71 percent from 4.70 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: A Softer, More Resilient Surface for Ball Fields in the City

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
New York City's fields of dreams are not what they used to be.
 Older New Yorkers may wax wistful about the billows of dust kicked up by a crisp single through the hole on a grassy field or the gullies that had to be dodged to complete a Willie Mays catch. But increasingly, the boys and girls of summer are playing their games on a more consistent surface, a new generation of synthetic turf made of plastic leaves of grass set among tiny rubber pellets.
 The Parks Department cites many economic and practical reasons for deciding to switch many of its fields from true to artificial grass, but the underlying cause says much about the changes in American athletics. Girls are using ball fields almost as much as boys, and grown-ups of all sorts are using them to keep in shape. And the waves of immigrants who prefer soccer to baseball mean that most ball fields are being used virtually year round. 
 As a result, many of the city's true grass fields have been undergoing punishing wear and tear and have had little time to recover from the pounding, becoming virtual dust bowls for most of the year.
 ''No grass field in the world can withstand 12 months of use,'' said Adrian Benepe, the city's commissioner of parks. ''If you play soccer every day in a ball field, there will be no grass within about six months.''
 The Parks Department experimented with its first conversion to artificial grass in 1997 in Chelsea Park at 28th Street and Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, but has converted more fields each of the past few years. 
 As of last month it had replaced 31 of its 763 grass or asphalt ball fields, with another 28 either under construction or scheduled for conversion. Some grass fields, like those on the Great Lawn in Central Park, are maintained with private money and heavily regulated, with play barred from September through April, and are not candidates for conversion. 
 Eddy Collyns, regional commissioner of the West Side Soccer League, which organizes games for 2,300 boys and 1,900 girls in the fall and spring and uses both artificial and true grass fields, said that synthetic grass allows his league to play more of its scheduled games because it is ready to use minutes after a rainstorm. He said the latest varieties of synthetic grass do not contribute to twisted ankles or kneecap burns and do not speed bounces the way that AstroTurf did. 
 ''It's softer, it's more forgiving,'' he said, adding that because of the rubber pellets spread among the blades of grass, ''the only complaint is that all that rubber goes into the kids' shoes and comes home.''
 But his view is by no means universal. Kim Travis, an actress who manages and plays in the Broadway Show League in Central Park, said she prefers ''the natural pitfalls'' of real grass, like the divots and mud patches.
 ''You know that after it rains when you're running between first and second it's going to be a little slick,'' she said. ''It becomes part of the game.'' 
 The synthetic grass the department is now using is not the small-pile AstroTurf carpet developed in the 1960's that was blamed for leg injuries, although some said that the turf was not at fault. It is a new variety of fake grass marketed under a half dozen different brands like FieldTurf, but almost always manufactured in Dalton, Ga., which styles itself ''the carpet capital of the world.'' It consists of a weave of two-and-a-half-inch-long polyethylene and polypropylene emerald green blades set in a porous backing for drainage, with thousands of tiny rubber pellets (made from used tires) sprinkled between the blades for cushioning. 
 The city's Parks and Recreation Department is now the country's largest municipal buyer of synthetic turf, followed by the parks departments of Los Angeles and Dallas. Synthetic turf is also used by scores of colleges and at least a dozen big-league football and baseball teams.
 Despite these prominent endorsements, the city's Parks Department is approaching the changeover slowly because many New Yorkers are wedded to the mystique of grass. The department, Mr. Benepe said, is also giving priority for conversion to heavily used fields where the more bruising game of soccer is played rather than baseball. 
 But the trend, for now, seems inevitable. ''This can never replace fresh grass, but it's the next best thing,'' said Dick Dadey, a spokesman for City Parks Alliance, a national organization. ''And the big disappointment of fresh grass is that after playing on it for so long there is no fresh grass. There's no fun playing on dirt that once was a lawn because of overuse.'' 
 The trend encompasses city schools as well. Since 2000, athletic fields at 36 public high schools have been carpeted with synthetic turf by a nonprofit organization, Take the Field, with six more in the works. The cost, three-fourths of it paid for by the city, is $150 million so far, said Richard A. Kahan, the organization's president. 
 Parks Department officials said a typical synthetic field costs $800,000 to $1 million to build, money that often comes from discretionary pools allowed city council members and other elected officials. Although the cost is more than that for a grass field, Mr. Benepe said the difference is made up by savings in maintenance costs, which for a real grass field can add up to $35,000 a year. 
 As any suburbanite with a lawn can testify, grass requires weekly mowing, almost daily watering during summer and periodic infusions of fertilizer. But maintenance on synthetic turf consists of a mechanical brushing every month or two to fluff up the nap. Most turf suppliers offer an eight-year warranty. One concern, however, is vandalism. Synthetic turf, though fire-retardant, can melt if set on fire, so most fields the department has converted are fenced. 
 Mr. Collyns of the West Side Soccer League said that the natural grass fields his league uses are mostly dirt speckled with rock. Two years ago, he said, the league canceled 10 games -- half its schedule -- because heavy rains rendered the fields unplayable. 
 William Castro, the commissioner for Manhattan parks, recalled that neighbors facing Thomas Jefferson Park on First Avenue and 114th Street complained about clouds of dust floating into their windows during soccer games. The department recently converted the field to synthetic turf. 
 Mr. Benepe said the grass fields of an imagined youth are overly sentimentalized.
 ''The reality is that you're either playing on asphalt with broken limbs and road rash or you're playing on dirt with rocks and broken glass,'' he said. ''I recall as a teenager playing on fields with gullies and rocks and pebbles and you'd come home bleeding from a simple touch football game. I don't remember it very fondly.''

HEADLINE: China Studies Complaint On Computer Chip Taxes

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 19 

 BODY:
China might be ill prepared to take on the fight against the United States before the World Trade Organization over the way it taxes computer chips, lawyers and analysts here said on Friday. 
 The United States filed a case against China at the W.T.O. on Thursday, demanding that it stop taxing imported chips at higher rates than domestically produced chips. Chinese trade officials and semiconductor industry representatives responded with a mixture of caution and indignation. 
 ''We're very disappointed the American business groups have taken this to the government,'' said Xu Xiaotian, the chief secretary of the China Semiconductor Industry Association. ''But it won't affect us,'' he added. ''We don't think it's a problem.''
 Chong Quan, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, which deals with trade matters, said the ministry was considering the filing and declined to answer further questions.
 Some American lawyers and experts based in China described the Chinese government's response to the threat of the W.T.O. case as flatfooted. 
 ''We're in new territory here,'' said Lawrence Sussman, a tax lawyer with O'Melveny & Myers in Beijing who specializes in China's semiconductor sector. ''China needs to take this seriously. They think the U.S. is bluffing, but it's not.''
 Yet Mr. Sussman said there might well be legal precedents for China to redraw its subsidies to shield them from W.T.O. challenges. ''I don't think it's an open-and-shut case,'' he added. The tax policy under challenge, was introduced in 2000 and imposes a value-added tax of 17 percent on imported semiconductors of 2.5 microns or less, while chips that are made or designed in China, whether by domestic or foreign companies, receive rebates that give them a 3 percent tax rate. 
 ''If you analyze the costs, China doesn't have any advantages, not in labor or land,'' said James Hexter, a consultant with McKinsey in Beijing. ''What really brings advantage is the tax benefits.''
 But even if the tax survives the legal challenge, China might not be able to overcome the technical and managerial hurdles preventing its chip factories from catching up with advanced chip makers in the United States and Taiwan, some Chinese officials and analysts said.
 ''The gap is quite clear,'' said an official with the Ministry of Information Industry who insisted that his name not be used. ''We're at least 3 to 5 years behind the Taiwanese manufacturers. The gap is shrinking, but it's still big.'' Nonetheless, the Chinese government remains committed to making semiconductors a crucial domestic industry by the end of the decade, Mr. Zhao added.
 Mr. Hexter said of China's chip industry, ''It's developed into a high-profile, strategic industry.''
 ''Any individual FAB may not recover costs,'' he added, referring to the factories that make semiconductors to order, ''but China has such potential as a high-tech powerhouse, it makes sense.'' 
 The Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif., which lobbied Washington to take action against China's tax program, points to 19 new semiconductor plants that are scheduled to be built in China by 2008.
 Growing concern over the loss of American jobs, especially in the high-tech sector, has also pushed the semiconductor issue to the forefront of an increasingly touchy trade relationship between China and the United States. ''I think the loss of these jobs matters,'' Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said in Beijing on Monday. ''It comes up constantly, and it's always China, China, China.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 23, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about a complaint filed by the United States against China over the way it taxes imported computer chips referred incorrectly to the ones that qualify for a tax of 17 percent. They are those with a circuit feature size of 0.25 microns or less, not 2.5 microns.
 The article also misstated the date of an interview with Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who commented on the dispute with China. It was on Wednesday, not March 15.

PERSON: Sherman R. Lewis

HEADLINE: Sherman Lewis, 67, Financier Who Was Executive at Lehman

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Sherman R. Lewis, a longtime financier who was a vice chairman at Lehman Brothers, died on March 11 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 67.
 The cause was leukemia, a Lehman Brothers spokeswoman said. 
 During a career that spanned more than 30 years at Lehman, Mr. Lewis rode the financial roller coaster of the last 25 years, through the boom and bust of the junk bond market, the 1987 stock market crash and the Internet boom of the late 1990's. He was a witness to the consolidation of the financial industry that has led to the present day behemoths.
 Mr. Lewis began his investment banking career in 1964. In 1973, he joined the brokerage firm Loeb Rhoades & Company and by 1977 was appointed president and co-chief executive, positions he maintained after Loeb merged with rival Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes & Trask, where he headed the investment banking division. After Shearson Hayden Stone, led by Sanford I. Weill, bought Loeb Rhoades, Hornblower & Company in 1979 for $250 million -- at the time the largest merger in Wall Street history -- Mr. Lewis was named president and vice chairman of the combined firm.
 Mr. Lewis stayed on after Mr. Weill sold Shearson to American Express in 1981 for $930 million. After Shearson bought the investment bank Lehman Brothers for $360 million in 1984, he rose to become co-head of investment banking and vice chairman.
 Lehman went on a buying spree during the 1980's. It expanded in Europe, Asia and the United States, entered new businesses and invested substantially in junk bonds. Then, the market crash in 1987 took its toll and American Express spun it off to its shareholders in 1994.
 Today, Lehman is one of only a few independent investment banks left.
 When it was formed in 1978, Loeb Rhoades, Hornblower & Company was considered a giant -- with annual revenue of $450 million. Last year, Lehman Brothers' revenue reached $8.6 billion.
 Born in Ottawa, Ill., Mr. Lewis graduated from Northwestern University and the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business Administration. 
 Mr. Lewis is survived by his wife, Dorothy Downie Lewis; two brothers, Robin and Randal; two sons, Thomas and Michael; two daughters, Catherine and Elizabeth A. Westphal; and two grandchildren.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Saturday about Sherman R. Lewis, a longtime financier who was a vice chairman at Lehman Brothers, misstated the name of a school from which he graduated. It is the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, not Business Administration.

HEADLINE: Bremer Pushes Iraq on Difficult Path to Self-Rule

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS; Jeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting from Baghdad for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 20 

 BODY:
For L. Paul Bremer III, the chief American administrator here, the contradictions of Iraq seemed to crystallize in a single moment this month. 
 In a hastily called public appearance, Mr. Bremer, 62, stood at a podium, grim and ashen-faced, to denounce a horrific wave of attacks that had killed more than 150 Iraqi civilians this month on one of the highest Shiite holidays.
 That same day, Iraqi leaders canceled a ceremony to commemorate Mr. Bremer's most significant achievement to date: the completion of an interim constitution intended to chart the country's path to democratic rule. 
 But instead of bestowing accolades on Iraqi leaders, Mr. Bremer could offer only condolences to the dead.
 ''Tuesday showed the dark vision of the evildoers,'' he said, his voice shaking with anger. ''They fight to ward off harmony and are happy to pave the road to power with the corpses of their innocent victims.''
 With that, he walked off the stage.
 In the 10 months since Mr. Bremer became the American-appointed proconsul of Iraq, much of his tenure has been like that: full of impressive achievements, clouded by the restless, divided nature of the country he is trying to oversee. Despite a widely admired work ethic, he has made a number of decisions that have been widely criticized and which appear to have undermined the very enterprise he is trying to move forward. 
 His early decision to disband Saddam Hussein's army, critics charge, created ready recruits for the insurgency and fueled resentment among Iraqis who fault the Americans for failing to protect them. Despite warnings of dissatisfaction with the American plan for the transfer, he failed to anticipate the political assertiveness of Iraq's Shiite majority. 
 Ultimately, criticism of his decisions will matter little if the new Iraqi state stands on its own after sovereignty is restored on July 1. The democratic institutions Mr. Bremer has helped create are sure to be tested in the months ahead, when American officials believe terrorists are planning major strikes against American and Iraqi targets. 
 Since May, Mr. Bremer has guided a multibillion-dollar reconstruction campaign that has restored many of the public facilities, like telephone lines and electrical grids, that had been stripped bare by looting that engulfed the country after the Hussein government collapsed. He has put in place a vast security apparatus, some 200,000 Iraqi police officers, soldiers and border guards, intended ultimately to replace more than 100,000 American soldiers trying to crush the guerrilla and terrorist campaigns still roiling the cities and countryside. 
 Most ambitious of all, Mr. Bremer has spearheaded the Bush administration's plan to implant a democratic system here, a blueprint that includes nationwide elections, a federal constitution and the rapid transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi people. 
 To accomplish that, he and his team have set up more than 250 city councils across the country and are rapidly preparing the central government to take over when the American occupation officially ends on June 30. And that, finally, will be the measure of his success or failure: whether the institutions he has tried to implant here -- at the accelerated pace he demanded -- sink or float.
 Mr. Bremer, a polished diplomat who does not want for self-assurance, says the desire for democracy he sees in the eyes of Iraqis will prevail over the efforts of those who are trying to destroy it. Success, he says, is much more likely than the nightmare set of events feared by many Iraqis of terrorism and civil war. ''I think the chances are very slim,'' he said of the likelihood of disaster, when he made public remarks on Friday to observe the anniversary of the start of the war. ''You can always play 'what if.' I just don't think it's going to happen. This country is very different from 12 months ago.'' 
 As the man who replaced Mr. Hussein, Mr. Bremer looms large over this occupied land. He is regarded by many Iraqis as earnest and hard-working, the benevolent despot they never had. 
 In January, when the Americans began replacing the old Iraqi currency, known here as ''Saddam money,'' the face of the deposed Iraqi leader was removed from the new notes. Mr. Hussein's face was replaced by a date palm, but Iraqis quickly gave the currency a new name: ''Bremer money.''
 Some Iraqis ask Mr. Bremer for personal help. Among them is Ali Bressem, a villager who has been searching for a year for a way to help his 12-year-old son. The boy's face was scorched by an American cluster bomb at the start of the war. One day, Mr. Bressem went to a computer shop and had a letter typed. 
 ''Dear Mr. Bremer,'' the letter began. ''Please accept our gratitude. During the last war of liberating Iraq, my house was exposed to a bombing. What is worse is that my son Ayad was exposed to a very severe injury in his eyes and face. We need help. We have no one to resort to but your excellency.''
 Mr. Bressem, a date farmer in the southern town of Kifil, recently took a bus to Baghdad, looking for Mr. Bremer's driver. ''If I could find his driver,'' he said, ''he could take my letter to Mr. Bremer.'' But when he got to the heavily protected area known as the green zone, he said, soldiers shooed him away.
 For Americans in the green zone, the impeccably dressed Mr. Bremer has inspired something of a fad. His one sartorial concession to the war zone is a pair of combat boots, usually worn with a wool blazer, silk tie and white handkerchief. Many American officials now wear combat boots with suits and ties; so, too, when he visits, does Mr. Bremer's boss, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld.
 Summing up his accomplishments, Mr. Bremer reminds his questioners that he did not create the disaster that befell Baghdad and much of Iraq in the anarchic days that followed the collapse of Mr. Hussein's government. He was merely asked to clean it up. 
 ''As I drove in from the airport, Baghdad was on fire, literally,'' Mr. Bremer said. ''There was no traffic in the streets. There was not a single policeman on duty anywhere in the country. There was no electricity anywhere in the country. There was no economic activity anywhere.''
 When he gazes out on Iraq today, he sees a country where a measure of law and order has been restored, where economic growth has resumed, where the basic elements of a modern society, like electricity and running water and schools, have largely returned to what they were before the war. Oil production, the country's fountain of wealth, has returned to its prewar levels. There is a constitution, finally signed by the Iraqis, that provides for individual rights. 
 Iraq is now poised, Mr. Bremer says, to enter a period of rapid growth, development and prosperity. ''So when I look at where we have arrived from where started, it is an astonishing record,'' he said.
 Americans and Iraqis who work closely with him praise his drive and his ability to grapple with the range of Iraq's problems. To many Iraqi leaders, his finest moment came with the completion of the interim constitution, an effort that succeeded in securing the assent of all 25 members of the Iraqi Governing Council and reconciling the desires of Iraq's tapestry of ethnic and religious groups.
 The agreement was reached after days of intricate bargaining, which Iraqi leaders say Mr. Bremer shepherded at almost every step. When the Iraqis hit a snag around midnight on Feb. 29, the deadline they had set for themselves, Mr. Bremer proved decisive in breaking the deadlock. ''It was past midnight, but Bremer said no one was going home,'' said Rozh Shawais, a senior leader in the Kurdish Democratic Party.
 In fact, Mr. Bremer let the Iraqi leaders go home early that morning. They later returned, finally striking a deal at 4:20 the next morning. ''Bremer was involved in every detail of the constitution,'' Mr. Shawais said.
 But while few doubt Mr. Bremer's commitment, some Iraqis say that in his drive to impose his vision on the country, he has sometimes failed to listen and, as a result, has made serious mistakes.
 The most widely criticized of his decisions was one he made before he had even arrived. On the plane to Iraq, he decided to disband the 400,000-man Iraqi Army, which left thousands of trained soldiers unemployed. American officials say many of those former soldiers later formed the backbone of the guerrilla resistance to the occupation.
 Despite the criticism, Mr. Bremer stands by the decision, saying there was no Iraqi army left to deal with anyway. ''I don't have any second thoughts about disbanding the army,'' he said. ''Neither did the secretary of defense, and he's my boss.''
 Other pitfalls have marked Mr. Bremer's tenure here, many of them turning into political embarrassments. According to administration officials, Mr. Bremer assured officials in Washington last fall that he could persuade Iraqi leaders to accept the presence of Turkish troops in the country.
 Instead, the Iraqis, deeply suspicious of Turkish motives, rebelled, forcing the Bush administration and the Turks to back off.
 Like many Americans and Iraqis, Mr. Bremer also seemed to underestimate the political power of Iraq's Shiite majority, and in particular, of its religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. Shiite leaders say they warned Mr. Bremer last fall when he presented them with a plan that called for caucus-style gatherings as the primary means for choosing a national assembly.
 When Mr. Bremer persisted, Ayatollah Sistani declared his opposition and sent thousands of Iraqis into the streets. The caucus plan was abandoned.
 ''Bremer has a personality type which is domineering, determined and decisive,'' said Dr. Mowaffak al-Rubaie, a member of the Iraqi Governing Council and a neurologist. ''He makes decisions on the run. Nine out of 10 times, he makes the right decision. But the 10th time, he makes the wrong one, and that's the really important issue.'' 
 Many Iraqi leaders have credited Mr. Bremer with helping transform the Governing Council from an unwieldy debating society into a functioning legislature. At the same time, some Iraqis say he has sometimes gone too far, dictating to the Iraqis what they must and must not do.
 In February, with Iraqi leaders nearly finished writing their constitution, Mr. Bremer publicly threatened to veto any attempt to impose Islamic law. The statement enraged Shiite leaders, who say they were so angered by his threat that they inserted stronger terms regarding Islam than they had originally favored. 
 ''When Mr. Bremer said that, we felt that Islam might be excluded,'' said Hamed al-Bayati, a senior leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a political party. ''So we decided to strengthen the role of Islam.''
 What seems certain is that the next few months will be dangerous. American and Iraqi officials are bracing for new waves of suicide attacks, intended to turn the Iraqis against their would-be protectors.
 On a visit to Al Kut, a city southeast of Baghdad, Mr. Bremer found mixed signs. The chairman of the provincial council, Abid Suleman al-Satar, told him that there was not enough time before June 30 to prepare for the transfer. The police were incompetent, Mr. Satar said, and he feared that some local political parties would take advantage of the instability. ''We have to have a longer period of time,'' he told Mr. Bremer. ''This is a very short time to ensure that the political process is good.''
 Mr. Bremer waved away the warnings. ''People are going to have to learn faster,'' he told Mr. Satar. ''Most Iraqis do not want elections to be delayed.''
 Later in the day, Mr. Bremer flew by helicopter to inspect an irrigation project financed by the United States. The scene, choreographed by his handlers, nonetheless contained signs that the Iraqi enterprise was gathering a momentum of its own.
 The project, costing $167,000, refurbished or replaced five aging irrigation pumps on the Tigris River. It was the first time in 36 years, said an Iraqi supervisor, that the pumps had operated at full capacity.
 ''Thank you, thank you!'' cried Hekmet Rasoq, the 64-year-old supervisor, shaking Mr. Bremer's hand. Behind him, a crowd of Iraqis had come of their houses to wave.
 ''They should thank you,'' Mr. Bremer said of the Iraqis. ''You're doing all the work.''

HEADLINE: Carbon Dioxide in Air Rises at Faster Rate, Scientists Say

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MAUNA LOA OBSERVATORY, Hawaii, March 20 

 BODY:
Carbon dioxide, the gas largely blamed for global warming, has reached record-high levels in the atmosphere after growing at an accelerated pace in the past year, say scientists monitoring the sky from this two-mile-high station atop a volcano.
 The reason for the faster buildup requires more analysis, experts say.
 ''But the big picture is that CO2 is continuing to go up,'' said Russell Schnell, deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's climate monitoring laboratory in Boulder, Colo., which operates the Mauna Loa Observatory on the island of Hawaii. 
 Carbon dioxide, produced mostly by burning coal, gasoline and other fossil fuels, traps heat that otherwise would radiate into space. Global temperatures increased by about one degree Fahrenheit during the 20th century, and international panels of scientists sponsored by world governments have concluded that most of the warming probably was due to greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide.
 The climatologists forecast continued temperature rises that will disrupt the climate, cause seas to rise and lead to other unpredictable consequences -- unpredictable in part because of uncertainties in computer modeling of future climate.
 Before the industrial age and extensive use of fossil fuels, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 280 parts per million, scientists have determined.
 Average readings at the Mauna Loa Observatory, where carbon dioxide density peaks each northern winter, hovered around 379 parts per million on Friday, compared with about 376 a year ago.
 That year-to-year increase of about 3 parts per million is considerably higher than the average annual increase of 1.8 parts per million over the past decade, and markedly more accelerated than the 1-part-per-million annual increase a half-century ago, when observations were first made here.
 Asked to explain the stepped-up rate, climatologists were cautious. But Asia sprang to mind.
 ''China is taking off economically and burning a lot of fuel. India, too,'' said Pieter Tans, a prominent carbon-cycle expert at the Boulder lab.
 Another leading climatologist, Ralph Keeling, noted that the rate ''does fluctuate up and down a bit,'' and he said it was too early to reach conclusions. But he added: ''People are worried about 'feedbacks.' We are moving into a warmer world.''

HEADLINE: Restaurants du Jour: Heavy on the Decor

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
LIGHTS! Camera! Action! Eat!
 The parallel between theatrics and dining out is not that far-fetched in contemporary Connecticut. Look around at restaurants that have opened in recent years: L'Escale, whose spacious dining rooms with back-lighted cabinetry, tiled floors and fire place convey a touch of Provence in Greenwich; Pastis in Hartford, reprising a Belle Epoque Parisian brasserie; Bentara in New Haven, using Asian artifacts, panels and screens to accent its Malaysian food; Zinc, also in New Haven, whose savvy interior highlights a zinc-faced bar and zinc table that seats 10; Luca Ristorante Italiano in Wilton, with romantic lighting and decor that suggests a Tuscan villa; and Nuage and Ku in Cos Cob, both evoking Japanese cool in their understated interiors.
 In the past, Connecticut restaurant decor was often as bland as the food. Nowadays, good food and service are rarely enough.
 ''In the past 15 years, restaurateurs have become more sophisticated on all levels,'' said Bruce Beinfield of Beinfield Architecture in Norwalk. ''As the marketplace has become more competitive, restaurants want to distinguish themselves from their competition.'' 
 Among the restaurants his firm has designed in recent years are Barcelona and Match in South Norwalk, Miramar in Westport and Il Palio in Shelton.
 With Barcelona and Match, Mr. Beinfield said: ''I wanted to create a hip urban experience without going to New York City. The idea in Barcelona was to use steel for the bar front and concrete on the floor. In Match we made a chandelier of copper, a bar top of stainless steel, and used steel plate and I-beams for an industrial urban look. The aim is for an edgy feeling, where pedestrians can just walk in.''
 One of the most hip looking recent restaurants is Ocean Drive, another project by Mr. Beinfield in South Norwalk. The owner's idea, he said, ''was to create the feeling you are on vacation in Miami's South Beach.'' Individual booths, closed off with airy, translucent blue curtains, are like beach cabanas; the bar is sculpted like a surfboard and there are portholes. 
 ''Walking into a well-designed restaurant adds a palpable energy to dining out,'' Mr. Beinfield said. 
 One of the most spectacular restaurants recently opened, or remade, is Bleu Cafe, a bistro in Greenwich. The restaurant is the creation of Jody Pennette, who was a co-owner before he took his restaurant concepts and design business to California. Mr. Pennette helped transform Bleu Cafe's long, narrow storefront into a mysterious space with French chandeliers of exposed blue light bulbs with cords twisted around them, mirrors, shell-shaped dining booths along one wall and a zinc bar along the opposite one. Down the center of the room is a 32-foot refectory table lighted with several candelabras. The effect is magical. 
 Not all the new restaurants are so dramatic. Bistro du Soleil in South Norwalk, for example, proves that originality can take many forms. When Bernardo and Soledad Munoz decided to move from their tiny storefront cafe in Rowayton to South Norwalk, they asked one of their customers, Allen Kolkowitz, for advice. Mr. Kolkowitz, an architect with Kolkowitz/Kusske in Rowayton, said, ''I advised them, as recent Chilean immigrants with friendly personalities and a loyal clientele, to create an open kitchen facing banquettes, so they could talk to customers as they worked.''
 ''My design was a gift,'' he said. ''Bernardo and his son did all the labor.''
 The gift, which Mr. Munoz estimates to be worth between $30,000 to $60,000 in design fees, has resulted in an airy interior with tables in front, banquettes and open kitchen in the rear, handsome wood floors and contemporary sculpture and paintings by Mr. Munoz's artist friends. Resembling a stylish cafe-cum-art gallery, it is a natural fit in art-minded SoNo. 
 Often an owner is inspired by a theme and hires an architect to conceptualize it. Jay Haverson, a partner in the firm Haverson Architecture and Design in Greenwich, designed Mediterraneo in Greenwich.
 ''The client, Ramze Zakka, is a sailor and he wanted a nautical feel, but not overdone like Long John Silver,'' Mr. Haverson said.
 The result is a beautiful wooden floor subtly resembling the deck of a ship, with sails on the walls and a navigation map on the ceiling, all of which, he said, ''suggest the sea without being overly thematic.'' 
 In designing Gaia, a new restaurant in a landmark building in Greenwich, Tony Chi, of Tonychi and Associates in New York, had to deal with the vintage terra cotta arches and ceiling that framed the interior. ''I couldn't alter the space,'' he said, ''but I could embrace and accent it.''
 Mr. Chi did so by letting the beautiful golden tiles dominate, complementing them with neutral colors -- ''vanilla ice cream is a wonderful base for anything'' -- an eye-catching chandelier and an adroit use of space. ''Restaurant design is a great collaboration,'' he said. ''The chef and his needs are as important as the other elements.''
 Chef Christer Larsson and his wife, Deborah, would agree. She said when they opened Alta in Greenwich three years ago, they wanted ''a contemporary Scandinavian look to reflect the chef's Swedish background and Scandinavian menu.'' They called on Eve-Lynn Schefer of David Schefer Design, a New York firm that had worked on their former restaurant in Manhattan. 
 ''Eve-Lynn chose a textured fabric by Jack Lenore Larson to accent the birch branches, which to us symbolize Scandinavia,'' Ms. Larsson said. 
 Ms. Schefer said the two-level space of the restaurant didn't require a lot of intervention. ''We wanted to keep the design simple and elegant, like the best of Scandinavia, and reflect the food and owners,'' she said.
 The emphasis on individuality may date to 1993, when Terra Ristorante opened in Greenwich. Underscoring its Italian menu was a room that suggested a Tuscan villa, with a sky-painted ceiling, decorative lunettes and a terrazzo floor. Frederick Brush Design Associates, the New Canaan architectural firm that designed Terra, later designed three other restaurants for Terra's owner, Ramze Zakka: Acqua in Westport with a Mediterranean motif; Sole, an Italian restaurant in New Canaan; and a fin-de-siecle motif for Le Figaro Bistro de Paris in Greenwich.
 Like other architects who specialize in restaurant design, Frederick Brush thrives on the theatricality. ''When I was young I was a set designer for MGM and I love stage sets,'' he said. ''Going to a restaurant is like attending a play. You want to get away from everyday life and respond to the excitement of a different environment.'' 
 Mr. Brush said a key to successful restaurant design is the client has to know his demographics. ''The younger the age group, the wilder you can be in your design concepts and in the allowable noise,'' he said.
 Baang Cafe and Bar in Riverside proved that in 1995 when it made aesthetic waves with an interior designed by Rockwell Group, a New York City design firm. The high-ceilinged dining room exploded with disparate colors and shapes and surfaces on two levels and provided a stage for Asian fusion cooking, which Baang introduced to the Connecticut dining scene. With its noisy originality, Baang's clientele is mainly youthful. Splash, Baang's Westport offspring, is just as cacophonous; its decor, by the Rockwell Group, fits its name with a glittery wave-like blue-green mosaic stretching along one entire white wall. 
 While smart design contributes to a restaurant's success, it is no guarantee of it. Otherwise such handsome places as Miramar in Westport, Bamba and Wildfire in Greenwich and the Great American Cafe in Glastonbury would still be in business. But as long as patrons are attracted to the new, restaurateurs will probably continue to showcase their establishments as dramatically and exuberantly as possible.
 ''Using architects to convey a strong image is not just a trend,'' Mr. Haverson said. ''It's becoming an economic necessity.''

HEADLINE: Through the Roof

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

 BODY:
SO many new construction projects have been started in East Lyme, so many zoning variances granted, so much discussion of clearing this and building that, that to Bob Gadbois the term ''planning board'' has been rendered almost an oxymoron. 
 Mr. Gadbois, who has spent virtually all of his 63 years in what is still a cozy New England town of 18,000, is concerned about the lingering effects of 15 years of intense development that has seen the town's population increase by better than a fifth, lengthening traffic delays, burdening sewer lines and heralding the arrival of decidedly uncozy businesses like the Super Stop&Shop grocery store.
 But perhaps what puzzles Mr. Gadbois most about the changes in his community is the math that officials use to measure them. 
 ''You go to these planning meetings and they say, 'Don't worry, this will only bring 1.2 more cars.' I ask them 'What's a point-2 car?''' Mr. Gadbois said. ''The same with kids. They talk about 2.5 children. What's point-5 children? I haven't seen half a kid yet.''
 What he has seen in his community, though, is more cars, more families, more children, more taxes, and especially more wealth. According to the Census Bureau, the 30-square-mile census tract that includes East Lyme and a cluster of other communities has witnessed the greatest percentage increase in family income from 1990 to 2000 in all of Connecticut. Figures show that the average family income nearly tripled in that decade, and economic experts say there is every reason to believe that the trend has accelerated.
 The texture of the town is in flux as well. Experts say the flood of new money may be squeezing those in the middle and working classes who have traditionally been a large segment of former farming and fishing towns like East Lyme. For longtime residents of such communities, it can be difficult not to feel alienated.
 ''A lot of people say: 'Oh, you live in East Lyme? It's a ritzy town,''' said Mr. Gadbois's wife, Mary. ''Well, there are some of us here that aren't so ritzy.''
 Resentment of the change may have been evidenced here last year when Democrats running on an anti-sprawl platform were the top vote getters for the town's planning commission and made other key gains.
 The makeover is not limited to East Lyme. Just down the road a bit in New London, a sliver of a neighborhood wedged between Connecticut College and the United States Coast Guard Academy saw the state's greatest percentage increase in home values in the last census. Housing experts and real estate agents say communities in a roughly 20-mile radius around East Lyme, including Norwich in the north to Stonington on the Rhode Island border, have some of the largest increases in home values in the state. 
 ''It's becoming very difficult for people with income less than $300,000 to actually stay in a lot of the communities they've been in,'' said Candace Howes, an associate professor of economics at Connecticut College. ''You've got these old fishing villages that have become the hot new place.''
 The emergence of the nearby Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods casinos and a major expansion of the Pfizer plant in New London have further driven the already outsize demand for quality housing in surrounding areas, including East Lyme.
 ''It's going crazy,'' said Pat Pastor, a manager with William Raveis Real Estate & Homes Services, who said that she had seldom seen anything like the current trend in 30 years of selling homes in the market. ''There was a lull in the business in the early 90's, and then we got the casinos.'' And the lull, Mr. Pastor said, was no more.

The Two Middle Classes
 Sociologists and economists say soaring real estate prices mean it simply costs more for a middle-class family to stay in the middle. Some experts see a widening gulf in the middle of the middle class, separating those who have and those who have more.
 ''More and more it's a case of winners and losers in the middle class,'' said Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. ''There are two groups. If you have a secure and steady job, own a home, you can be doing quite well. Then there are all those people who are on a slippery slope who are afraid that they're going to lose their job or that it will go off to India. 
 ''They're the ones who are the forgotten middle class,'' she said.
 Dr. Fainstein said that those most affected by skyrocketing home values in the region are first-time buyers and the young.
 ''The people for whom it's really hard are people just entering the housing market, young couples, people without a nest egg or without parents who can help them,'' she said. ''They're the middle class that's downwardly mobile, because even if you have a decent income, who has $60,000 in the bank for a down payment when they just got out of college or graduate school or wherever?''
 The current tightening of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan region is simple supply and demand. Because there is little affordable housing being built, whatever existing quality housing stock remains is sometimes fought over by prospective buyers with dueling bids.
 All of which serves to price large segments of the middle class out of some real estate markets.
 ''I don't know how people are doing it,'' said Rachel Ranis, a sociology professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden. ''It's very hard for any family to buy in this market unless both parties are working.''
 At the same time it has become harder for many to enter the housing market, and those who do make it want even more once they get there. 
 ''People's expectations have gotten higher,'' she said. ''Before, we were happy to have just one car in a household. Now, everyone has to have a car. If you buy a house, everyone has to have a room. People have changed a lot.''
 What has remained largely constant, Professor Ranis said, are the forces that drive homebuyers into the suburbs around the region -- the quest for bigger yards, better schools and perhaps a slower, more measured pace of living.
 Professor Ranis noted that another factor appears to be playing a larger role: worry. 
 ''One thing we find is that you're worried that you will be able to duplicate what you've always considered middle class,'' she said. ''The key value is how to keep yourself where you are and your children, how to give them the best start.
 ''There's a lot of pressure on people to keep up with what they're accustomed to,'' she said. ''It's no longer about keeping up with the neighbor next door, it's their own wants and what they're accustomed to.''
 But in the status-conscious suburbs, a larger home is still the No.1 symbol of success.
 ''The ones who are doing well, you see people going out and getting bigger and bigger houses,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''You look at some of these homes that have closets the size of my bedroom when I grew up.''
 And the reason size matters?
 ''It's the symbol of your achievement, the symbol of your status,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''It puts a premium on those homes with the center hall and the chandelier and all this space where you can demonstrate your lifestyle.''
 While practically no one would prefer that a community be poorer rather than richer, some experts wonder about the effects of such changes on the character of established middle-class communities.
 ''All of the suburbs that have maintained quality housing have become more and more exclusive,'' Dr. Fainstein said.
 More exclusive perhaps, but also, say some, communities in high-priced markets grow less diverse and its residents less connected socially.
 ''It has a huge impact of community connectedness,'' said Robert Fisher, the director of urban and community studies at the University of Connecticut's West Hartford campus. ''The issue of social connectedness, a lot of that has to do with destabilization. While bringing affluence into these communities, a lot of people are pushed out as well.''
 Not to mention, Dr. Fisher said, those who because of high prices never get to enter some communities in the first place. ''What's happening is that the American dream is a little bit less within the reach of a lot of people,'' he said.

Growing Pains
 Before Mr. Gadbois retired, he worked for decades as a pipe fitter -- Local 305 and 777, he said, even in retirement, still union and still proud -- the kind of solidly middle-class tradesman who was once common in East Lyme. Now, according to census figures, better than one out of every four residents of the Gadboises' census tract reported that they worked in managerial, professional or business fields. And experts say that that number, like most everything else around East Lyme, is growing.
 ''The town has grown so dramatically and the changes are so great you wonder what's going to happen next,'' said Wilbur Beckwith, an East Lyme native and the town's official historian. At 74, Mr. Beckwith has seen much of the evolution of East Lyme firsthand. ''Before World War II the population was about 2,000,'' Mr. Beckwith said, noting that today it is nearly 10 times that figure. 
 East Lyme, formed in 1839 by secessionists from neighboring Waterford and Lyme for reasons that Mr. Beckwith, who traces his ancestry to some of them, said are lost to time, was a place of farmers and fishermen well into the 20th century. When he was a child, Mr. Beckwith said, the town was a thinly populated slice of the hinterlands that made New London, about eight miles down the road, seem like nothing less than a teeming metropolis by comparison.
 ''New London was sort of the car city,'' Mr. Beckwith said. ''Kids from Niantic'' -- part of East Lyme town -- ''were called clam diggers, you know, hicks.
 ''There used to be chicken farms,'' he continued. ''Now, nobody raises chickens in town anymore. And you'll only find the older folks doing some recreational clamming.''
 East Lyme began to change with the growth of the suburbs that followed World War II. The area is home to the United States Coast Guard Academy, the Naval Submarine Base, the drug manufacturer Pfizer and the Electric Boat unit of the General Dynamics Corporation.
 Once a dominant presence with upward of 20,000 employees, Electric Boat laid off thousands of employees in the mid-1990's. The company's post-cold war downsizing was a defining moment for the region. ''It really cut the heart out of the middle class in New London County,'' Dr. Howes said. The jobs now being created in the area are more of a mix, with higher-income jobs at companies like Pfizer and lower-wage jobs at the nearby casinos.
 Pfizer, which already had a base of operations across the Thames in Groton, completed a Global Research and Development Facility on the New London side of the river in 2001. Pfizer officials say the research center, which covers 750,000 square feet and cost nearly $300 million to build, has brought at least 1,500 employees to the area.
 To meet the influx of new residents, home builders have not exactly thrown caution to the winds. According to the town's figures, from April 2002 to April 2003 this community of about 35 square miles averaged little more than one new housing start a week.
 The combination of population growth, new money, low mortgage rates and a modest level of residential construction has made life interesting for local real estate agents like Mark E. Landry, who has been a seller in the area for the last five years -- just about the length of the latest boom.
 ''The business has picked up steadily over the years,'' Mr. Landry said. ''There's just not enough housing to go around to supply the need.''
 The result has sometimes been bidding wars between buyers, with some agents noting winning bids that are as much as $50,000 over the original asking price.
 ''It's competitive,'' Mr. Landry said. ''You're going to get top dollar.''
 Mr. Landry pulled a chair over to a computer screen in his office at Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage on Flanders Road in Niantic and punched a few keys to bring up the entries on the Multiple Listing Service, the shared database used by real estate agents.
 ''This one sold for $10,000 over asking price,'' he said, his finger moving over a thumbnail photo of a recently built condominium townhouse in New London that sold for $175,000. Last year, he said, that property might have sold for $25,000 less.
 He mentioned a burst of new construction north of East Lyme, near Norwich. He fingered a few more keys on the computer and up popped a handful of listings for condominiums in the Norwich area, near the Mohegan Sun Resort Casino in Uncasville. 
 Three bedrooms. Sixteen hundred square feet. All selling for more than $350,000. Even Mr. Landry seemed surprised.
 He was asked what those properties would have sold for a year ago.
 ''They didn't have anything like that a year ago,'' he said.

Drawing Point: the School
 In the next few weeks, Lily Tong and her family will move into their custom-built four-bedroom home in a slice of East Lyme that didn't exist until recently: the Heritage Fields subdivision. 
 A nine-year resident of next-door Waterford, Ms. Tong and her husband, Jim Lua, studied many communities that dot Connecticut's southern shore as they searched for a new home.
 They, like so many others, were charmed by East Lyme. When they did not find an existing home that they liked among the colonials, ranches and splits that make up most of the housing stock here, they decided to build their own.
 ''We felt that this was the place we liked most,'' said Ms. Tong, 44.
 So armed with a $100,000 profit from her Waterford home, Ms. Tong and her family began looking. And once they settled on a location and design, they were willing to wait for what they wanted. For the last eight months, Ms. Tong, her husband and their two children, ages 9 and 14, have lived in a rental property until their home is completed later this month.
 The Tongs are typical of many who are moving to East Lyme. Ms. Tong works at Pfizer and her husband at Anteon, a government contractor in Mystic. With their dual incomes and professional backgrounds, they are emblematic of the upper-middle class infusion here. And as Asian Americans, they are part of the Census Bureau's ''other'' group, the nonwhites, nonblacks, non-Hispanics who, according to census figures, tripled in number in the area surrounding East Lyme in the 1990's. Blacks and Hispanics each fell to about 1 percent of the census tract's population, down from 6 percent and 3 percent respectively. Besides location, location, location, Ms. Tong said that her family chose East Lyme for another reason: schools, schools, schools.
 The high school has become a perennial winner of prestigious education awards and has a sterling reputation in the region. In fact, Ms. Tong said, the school may have played as big a role in her home purchase as anything else.
 ''It doesn't matter how good the price is,'' she said. ''If it's not a good system, we wouldn't buy.''
 The role of the school district in bringing in people like Ms. Tong and her family is not lost on Dr. John F. Reynolds, superintendent of the roughly 3,500-student East Lyme School District. 
 ''It's a neat place,'' Dr. Reynolds said.
 But, often, the district finds itself being criticized for its own success. According to town figures, more than three quarters of East Lyme residents do not have school-age children, making for contentious school budget votes.
 Often the superintendent finds himself having to explain how the benefits of good schools spill over even to those who do not have children.
 ''You have to ask, are we going to have a system that is a source of pride?'' he said. ''Or is it just something that they think is just going to raise their taxes?''
 A rapprochement of sorts may have been reached recently when a measure to construct a new swimming pool for the district was ratified by voters, including many of the town's older residents.
 The key to the victory? It was promised that the pool would be open to all in the town, not just students. Gaining that kind of buy-in, Dr. Reynolds said, stems from preaching an open door policy and budget efficiencies.
 ''We got them in,'' he said. ''And we've got to keep finding ways to get them in. You have to say to folks, 'If you give me a dime, I'll get 11 cents out of it.''' 

Currents of Change
 Besides schools, many here are also concerned about the effects of the growing population on local businesses. Already a Super Stop& Shop is under construction along Flanders Road, much to the chagrin of longtime residents who have been accustomed to more intimate stores and boutiques around town.
 And while some are resistant to change, others like Candy Shapiro, president of Niantic Main Street, an association of business owners, are trying to be like Connecticut birches and stay rooted while bending with the breeze.
 ''We're on the verge of just an explosive market here,'' said Ms. Shapiro, who runs a haberdashery on Main Street called Gracie, Gracie. ''If the smaller stores are going to thrive, they're going to have to find their niche.''
 She said that might mean finding an upscale specialty that caters to those moving into the community. ''Change is always going to be uncomfortable for some,'' Ms. Shapiro said. The key, she added, is ''that it doesn't destroy the essence of the town.'' 
 While the future of East Lyme may remain uncertain, what's clear is that the changes here have made people like Mr. Gadbois uncomfortable.
 ''This town is being developed too fast,'' said Mr. Gadbois, who remains dissatisfied about the town's current course. ''You just can't keep on building and developing without a plan.'' 
 Mr. Gadbois said that much of the development in the region has seemed haphazard. For instance, he said, within just a few miles of his home there are two Wal-Mart stores and two Dunkin' Donuts. ''I don't know which one they want me to go to,'' he said.
 Besides that, he said, he is concerned that some of his fellow retirees who live on fixed incomes are being forced out of the town by rising tax bills. ''I know somebody who had to move down to Florida,'' he said.
 The prospect sends a shudder through Mr. Gadbois and his wife, who have lived in East Lyme all of their lives, save one year immediately after their marriage 40 years ago when they lived in New London while they saved to buy a home. 
 Yes, their roots go deep. And while they understand that they may not be able to stop the continuing growth and development in their beloved town, they hope to prompt further discussion about where it is headed. 
 ''We know that things do change and people have to change,'' Mrs. Gadbois said. ''But when we get to where we want to go, we have to ask, 'Is that really where we want to be?'''

HEADLINE: Sellers' Market

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MAKER

 BODY:
GRACE FRANJOLA whirled around the spacious country kitchen of a $1.5 million mansion in Roxbury, pouring potent cocktails, passing fancy hors d'oeuvres she had made herself and giving hearty hugs to a steady stream of people coming and going.
 This was no ordinary party. This was a ''cocktail sunset'' real estate open house, the kind of glamorous gala that Ms. Franjola regularly throws to market the many high-end properties she has listed in Litchfield County.
 Besides the swarms of seasoned real estate agents and prospective buyers at the event was another set of people who were there to observe how Ms. Franjola, 51, has earned her reputation for pulling out all the stops when it comes to selling houses: a retinue of rookie sales agents watching her every move, hoping to learn what it takes to succeed in the increasingly competitive world of real estate. 
 ''This woman is a genius, she works miracles,'' said Sevara Jeleva, 42, a former journalist who joined Ms. Franjola's Washington agency, Grace & Co., a division of William Raveis International, in October. ''For me to start a new career in real estate, there is a lot to learn. So Grace is my mentor.''
 Todd Lillard, 33, recently left his home remodeling business to try his hand at real estate. ''I chose to align myself with William Raveis because they are very team oriented and they have a great training program,'' he said. ''Real estate can be horribly cutthroat, especially now with so many new people trying to break into the business, so it's nice to be learning from a true pro who tells it like it is.''
 The number of people selling real estate in Connecticut has hit a record high, according to the State Department of Consumer Protection. As of March 1, there were 15,798 licensed real estate sales people, up 28 percent from 2002, said Michele Erling, a spokeswoman for the department.
 The department does not break down those numbers by towns or counties, but many market watchers say it seems like Litchfield County is experiencing the highest influx of new agents in the state.
 ''We don't have the comparative data on hand, but there is certainly the sense that Litchfield County is experiencing one of the fastest-growing rates of people getting their real estate licenses,'' said Michelle Doyon, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Association of Realtors, an industry group.
 She said there are now 14,000 association members, up from 12,500 in 2002, with 756 in Litchfield County, she said. And while the association lists 73 members from Washington, some local real estate agents have done their own independent count and come up with a whopping 250 licensed sales people in Washington, which means one out of every 11 of the town's estimated 2,750 adults are agents. 
 The slow economy and mounting layoffs have prompted a growing number of people to turn away from careers in law, banking, business, finance, teaching, restaurant trades and the arts to give real estate a try. They're following the money: the real estate market has stayed strong despite the economy because of low interest rates and the ever-growing appeal of country properties. Countywide statistics for Litchfield are hard to come by, but Consolidated Multiple Listing Service figures for single-family homes in 7 of the county's 26 towns -- Bridgewater, Kent, Litchfield, Roxbury, New Milford, Warren and Washington -- show that the average sale price rose almost 25 percent over the past two years, from $314,297 in 2001 to $414,192 in 2003. But some agents say these figures are low, because some top agents in the area don't list their biggest deals. 
 Some top-tier agents in the area predict that 2004 will see a substantial number of $6 million-plus sales. There has only been one such sale in the county, and that was about five years ago.
 But Carolyn Klemm, one of Washington's top real estate agents, has a warning for the newcomers. ''People are very disillusioned about real estate as a career,'' she said. ''It's a profession that sounds a lot better than it is. You don't just go into real estate and start selling houses. It takes years to be successful, and that's only if you work seven days a week, every waking moment, no weekend breaks, no vacations, no family picnics.
 ''A lot of people come to me looking for a job, thinking they can just switch gears from whatever they're doing and get into real estate,'' Mrs. Klemm continued. ''I tell them, sorry, we only hire the top pros.''
 Such was the case with Stephen Greene, who was hired in January by William Raveis's Kent office. ''I called Carolyn Klemm and she said, 'Stephen, you know what? You're fabulous, but you're new. You'd better go to Raveis.''' Mr. Greene said he then called Seymour Surnow, another top Washington broker who did $38 million worth of business last year for Sotheby's International Realty, ''and Seymour said, 'Stephen, you know what? You're fabulous, but you're new. You'd better go to Raveis.'''
 Mr. Greene, 55, who was also at the Roxbury open house, said he decided to give real estate a try after being laid off from his hospital administration job in Manhattan last year. ''I basically just hung around and went golfing every day until I couldn't stand it anymore,'' he said between bites of deviled eggs and marinated artichoke hearts. ''I kept thinking real estate would be right for me because it's about being able to relate to all kinds of people and understanding what they need and what they want, which I think I'm good at.'' 
 So he took the state-mandated 36-hour course (which is offered at more than 40 locations across Connecticut), passed the state real estate exam and signed up with Raveis. And has sold nothing.
 ''No one wants to do business with a new broker, so you can just basically forget it for the first year,'' advised Stacey Matthews, a former Wall Street trader who went to work for Klemm Real Estate three years ago at the age of 33. For example, Mr. Lillard, the former contractor, has to work another full-time job as a bartender to make ends meet.
 Of the typical 5 percent sales commission on real estate transactions, the buyer's agent gets half and the seller's agent gets half, and the agents then typically split half of their take with the companies they work for. ''People see these houses in Litchfield County selling for $1 million plus, and they say, 'Let's see, 5 percent of $1 million is $50,000, wow!' But, if you're, let's say, the buyer's agent, you split half with your agency, and that's only $12,500, and you pay taxes on that,'' Ms. Matthews said.
 ''I think the thing that's finally made me successful at this is years of networking and establishing social contacts,'' she said. ''When you buy property here, it's not just about the house, it's about meeting people with the same interests, who have children the same ages. So I set up play dates,'' bringing prospective buyers' children, and parents, into contact with the neighbors. ''I have dinner parties, I introduce my clients to the people who will make them feel at home.'' 
 One new agent who had no problem joining Sotheby's was Dennis Kyte, an artist and architect whose 32-year domestic partnership with Mr. Seymour made real estate a natural option a year and a half ago.
 ''I'm an artist, I've always drawn for a living,'' said Mr. Kyte, 56, who is known worldwide for his botanical illustrations and the 17 children's books he has written and illustrated. But Mr. Kyte has also designed several homes in the area, including the homes he and Mr. Seymour have lived in. ''My great frustration was that I always loved houses and architecture so much, I knew I needed to be doing something along those lines,'' he said.
 At the encouragement of Sotheby's top executives, Mr. Kyte decided to get his real estate license, and, unlike some newcomers, surprised himself by making some deals right from the start. ''I basically did what they tell you to do in real estate school: I sat in front of my Rolodex and called everyone I know who I thought would be interested in buying or selling a house,'' he said with a grin.
 He knew of someone who was thinking of selling a gorgeous old converted barn overlooking a dramatic waterfall in New Preston, and with one phone call he found just the couple who would fall in love with it. In a matter of days, the deal was done for $650,000, and several sales exceeding $1 million have followed.
 Another neophyte defying the odds is Arnaud Bourgeois of Woodbury. As if his part-time jobs of pilot, antiques dealer and wine consultant weren't enough, Mr. Bourgeois, 36, decided last fall he would sell real estate, too. ''I went to Joyce Drakeley Real Estate because it's right next door to my house and I said, 'Look, I know I'm new, but I know a lot of people. I'm the coach of my daughter's soccer team. I know a lot of New Yorkers who come into our antiques store. I'd like to give it a try.'''
 Two months into his new job, Mr. Bourgeois has already made two big sales. ''Somebody once told me I could sell mittens in Miami,'' he said from his cell phone as he boarded a Gulfstream III for a flight out of Oxford airport. ''But you know what? It's because I care, that's the big thing. I care about people. And finding the perfect house for them is the ultimate reward for me.''

HEADLINE: An Uptown Museum Wonders If Downtown Is the Answer

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
The Hispanic Society of America, the museum and library in Washington Heights that gets few visitors but is known for its prized works by Goya and Velazquez, among others, is considering options to heighten its profile, including a move to Lower Manhattan.
 Those efforts got a boost last year when Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain requested help from the White House, resulting in visits by powerful Republicans, including Gov. George E. Pataki, who visited in July; Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; and Mel Martinez, then the secretary of Housing and Urban Development. ''It's about time,'' said Mitchell Codding, the executive director of the society. ''We'd had zero interest from public officials on the United States end. It's good that we've generated some interest.'' 
 But rumors of an imminent departure were exaggerated, he added. ''It's definitely not happening tomorrow,'' he said. ''We've been studying what our possibilities are for expanding facilities.'' 
 After his visit, the governor put society officials in touch with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, his office said in a statement. An initial effort to find space in Battery Park City was unsuccessful. The Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development agency, also assisted, and looked into who might be interested if the society's space became vacant. Boricua College, which has a campus in the complex, also got a call from state officials, said Victor G. Alicea, the college's president. ''Of course we're interested,'' he said.
 In the wake of the terrorism attacks in Madrid two weeks ago and the election last week of a new Socialist prime minister, it remains to be seen whether the society can count on additional help from Spain. 
 Only about 20,000 people a year visit the society, which is housed in Audubon Terrace, a Beaux-Arts complex built in the early 1900's. But it has always been a favorite of Spain's royal family: Felipe de Borbon, the Prince of Asturias, visited in 2001. The Museum of the American Indian and the American Geographic Society left the building years ago, and the American Numismatic Society is on its way out. 
 Local leaders betrayed little emotion when asked about the prospective loss of another cultural institution. ''I have mixed feelings,'' said Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat. ''They are a polished institution that gave the community some kind of prestige. On the other hand, they were never really able to connect to the community.'' SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: The Island's Pursuit of Innovation Flags a Bit

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
IS Long Island's Golden Age of Innovation over?
 The region's scientific ingenuity, which gave the world the technology for landing on the moon and the double-helix paradigm for understanding the human genome, reached its peak in 1998, if successful patent filings are the barometer. And it's been mainly sliding downward since.
 That was the one of the findings of a report, the Long Island Index 2004, compiled by the Rauch Foundation of Garden City at a cost of about $600,000. The decline in patents undermines the region's claims for technological eminence and limits its appeal as a center for business activity, the report said. 
 The number of patents issued to inventors in Nassau and Suffolk peaked at 937 in 1998, according to Collaborative Economics, the firm in Mountain View, Calif., that compiled the research. They dropped incrementally through 2001, reaching a low of 786. In 2002, the last year for which data were analyzed, there was a slight uptick, to 795.
 The falloff for Long Island comes at a time when the number of patents has been increasing nationally. From the 1999 fiscal year to the 2002 fiscal year, the number of patents awarded rose about 11 percent, from 159,166 to 177,317, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In categories like medical devices and electrical components, areas often cited by business leaders as the muscles in Long Island's physique, innovation actually lags behind the national average, the report said. But it based its conclusion on how often other inventors cite patents by Long Islanders, a measure that raised some eyebrows. 
 ''Applicants cite patents to be on the safe side,'' said Gerald T. Bodner, a partner in Bodner & O'Rourke, a patent law firm in Melville. ''How often a patent is cited doesn't necessarily correspond with its potential value or imply that it's important.'' 
 Oddly, the report cites the textile and apparel industries, effectively absent from Long Island, as areas of strength in patents. And despite the often-noted disappearance of manufacturing jobs, the Island showed more vitality for manufacturing processes than the rest of the country, on average.
 The report was intended ''to bring regional leaders together'' and to encourage ''systemic change'' by creating statistical comparisons with other regions of the country, said Nancy Rauch Douzinas, the president of the Rauch Foundation, which was formed in 1961 by her father and uncle, partners in an automotive supply manufacturing company in Brooklyn.
 Because Long Island's strength as a technological innovator is closely tied, in many minds, to its self-image, any report that dares question the fundamentals of this identity will inevitably be challenged.
 ''I have eight engineers working under me, and we have gained more than 30 patents'' since 2000, said James D'Addario, the president of J. D'Addario & Company in Farmingdale, a family-owned manufacturer of accessories for musical instruments. ''We have 28 patents pending.''
 He cited a patent for an accessory that fits into a bass drum and allows the player to insert metallic rings to alter the drum's sound, and another patent for an accessory that combines a tuning fork and string cutter, used by guitarists.
 Mr. D'Addario plans to expand the part of the business that creates cables used to connect instruments to amplifiers. ''We'd do more,'' he said, ''if I had the time to spare.''
 Mr. Bodner, the patent lawyer, said he was surprised to hear talk of a decline in the number of Long Island patents. ''I'm seeing a lot of small entrepreneurial companies filing patents,'' he said. ''I'm working seven days a week at this point.''
 Quite a few engineers who lost their jobs in earlier recessions and in defense industry consolidations have since founded their own businesses, he said. A number are now pursuing patents on their own and licensing those they have already secured.
 Stephen Smirti, a lawyer who handles intellectual property cases and a partner in the law firm of Rivkin Radler in Uniondale, dismissed the possibility that Long Island's brainpower was ebbing. ''I believe that downward trend is a blip,'' he said. ''A few years from now, we're not going to give that blip even a second thought.''
 Some of those involved in planning and presenting the Rauch report, subtitled ''Setting Goals, Measuring Progress for the Long Island Region,'' struggled to make sense of the findings. Ann-Marie Scheidt, the director of economic development at the State University at Stony Brook, who served on the report's advisory committee, said she was surprised by the Long Island textile and apparel patents. ''I was a little puzzled to see that number,'' she said. ''I am trying to figure it out myself.''
 The report showed other surprising results, including an apparent strength in patents for manufacturing processes. Carrie Meek Gallagher, the report's director, had a possible explanation. ''It could be the intellectual property was created here,'' she said, ''and the actual manufacturing is done elsewhere.''
 Some of the Island's leading business groups, universities, law firms and planning agencies participated in the compilation of the report, including the Long Island Association, the Regional Planning Board, the State University at Stony Brook and the Farrell Fritz law firm.
 Some people questioned the report's choice of statistical comparisons to measure innovation. Patent award figures are, at best, an imprecise measurement, said Daniel Weiss, the president of the New York Society of Professional Inventors, based in Farmingdale.
 ''Patents are expensive,'' he said. ''Inventors don't get them until they have to.''
 Herman Fialkov, a veteran venture capitalist and partner in New Light Ventures, in Jericho, said the sheer number of patents or their frequency of citation were unreliable indicators of economic vitality.
 ''It depends what the patents are for,'' he said. ''You can have a hundred patents, but if only one has a market value, you could be doing very well. It all depends on licensing potential.'' 
 At Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which has received 170 patents since 1990, talk of any lessening of ingenuity came as a surprise to John Maroney, who runs the lab's office that handles patents and licenses. 
 ''Biotech patent applications have skyrocketed since the late 1980's,'' he said. ''The reason is that the gap between basic research and commercialization has been dramatically reduced by genetic engineering tools.''
 As a result, a research institution like Cold Spring Harbor can contract with a private company to turn laboratory breakthroughs into products that land in short order on drugstore shelves and in hospital warehouses.
 ''This is now a game where a patent means you've hit a home run,'' Mr. Maroney said.
 Over the last decade, the generators of new technologies and new processes on the Island have undergone a major transformation. Not too long ago, the principal players were defense contractors like the Grumman and Sperry Gyroscope, and companies like Symbol Technologies, the bar code innovator, and the Pall Corporation, which specializes in scientific filtration.
 Sperry is gone, but Symbol, Pall and Northrop Grumman remain active creators. Other leaders in research and development range from very large research institutions like Stony Brook, Cold Spring Harbor, Brookhaven National Laboratory and North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health Systems to the very small inventor-entrepreneurs working in their basements or in the labs of family-owned businesses. 
 The patents Long Island gets these days ''are much more diversified than they used to be,'' said Peter Goldsmith, the chairman of the Long Island Software and Technology Network, or Listnet.
 The Stony Brook campus is granted 30 to 40 patents in a typical year, based on research undertaken by its faculty, said Jack Peterson, the director of its office of technology and licensing. Fees collected from licensing range from $12 million to $17 million a year, he said. 
 The big earner, he said, is still Reo Pro, a drug used to treat blood clots. Patented in 1995 and licensed to Johnson & Johnson, Reo Pro has brought in about $75 million in licensing fees. 
 Its inventor, Barry Coller, a professor of hematology who has since moved to Rockefeller University, shares half the licensing revenues with the university, in accordance with Stony Brook's standard contract. ''It's a very generous arrangement,'' Mr. Peterson said.
 Since gaining his first patent in 1998 for a device that secures window glass to its frame, Frank Manzella, a jazz trumpet player turned engineer-entrepreneur, has filed applications for six more patents and intends to file four more. The patents form the backbone of his West Babylon company, Thermo Roll Windows, a manufacturer of windows for commercial buildings.
 ''Once you put the window frame in, it never has to be removed again when you upgrade it,'' Mr. Manzella said, launching into his sales pitch. ''My technology keeps windows from falling in, and it prevents children from falling out. My windows reduce the cost of a window by 60 percent.''
 Mr. Manzella said that after seeing how a better product could outsell its competitors when its features were explained to potential customers, he went back to school to learn engineering, then returned again to learn accounting, finance and other business disciplines.
 ''It's really what I learned from the music industry,'' said Mr. Manzella, who graduated from Manhattan School of Music 40 years ago. ''You want to learn to play classical music, you go study with classical musicians. What you don't know, you can learn. So I learned finance, and I learned to figure out the machines.''
 Now his business is doing so well, he said, that he worries about keeping up with demand. As he put it: ''My father, who was a manufacturer in the garment center, used to say, 'Don't be the fellow with so much business he goes out of business.' I think about that these days.''

HEADLINE: In Philadelphia, Trying to Keep It Real

BYLINE: By MAUREEN TKACIK

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, March 19 

 BODY:
New York covets the Olympic Games in 2012. Boston won the Democratic National Convention this summer. All Philadelphia wanted was ''The Real World.'' 
 The tale of the city's loving and losing the 15th season of the MTV series, so popular with 12- to 34-year-olds that city boosters hoped it would lend a cool factor to Philadelphia, culminated in a street protest on Wednesday night. 
 By the weekend, the dispute had reached as high as the office of Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a former Philadelphia mayor, who was working to bring the show back.
 On Tuesday, the program's producers announced that they were leaving town three weeks before taping was to start. There had been trouble with the local Teamsters and construction unions, which wanted jobs in remodeling the former bank building in the Old City neighborhood where the ''Real World'' cast was to live.
 In reaction to the pullout, several dozen 20- and 30-year-olds mobilized by a group called Young Involved Philadelphia gathered at the partly renovated building carrying signs reading ''We Want Our MTV'' and ''Show Philly to the Real World.'' 
 ''I've had friends from New York and California, all across the country, e-mailing me about this, and everyone says the same thing: Philly's done it again,'' said Nicole Cashman, a publicist, who represents Yaron Properties, the developer that owns the building. 
 That Philadelphia's battered image would receive a lift from ''The Real World'' is a theme that has been sounded since Feb. 26, when it was announced that MTV producers had chosen the city. The Philadelphia Inquirer made it front-page news. City officials hoped the voyeuristic coverage of seven comely strangers thrown together in a hip pad would help Philadelphia retain more of the 51,000 students who graduate each year from local colleges and universities and tend to move away in throngs. (After MTV pulled out, one protester wrote to an online petition set up by The Philadelphia Daily News, ''Way to keep the brain drain flowing out of Philadelphia'').
 Jonathan Uhl said he heard about the pullout while gathered with eight friends in the artsy Northern Liberties neighborhood to watch the 13th episode of ''The Real World: San Diego'' (in which the hunky Randy, while drunk, makes out with a girl with a fake front tooth, only to avoid her call the next day). 
 ''This just epitomizes what's wrong with Philadelphia,'' Mr. Uhl said.
 The show's production company, Bunim/Murray, had hired nonunion workers to create a luxurious playpen for its cast, as it had in other cities where it taped, including New York and Chicago. Almost from the start, organized labor picketed at the site, at Third and Arch Streets.
 Pat Gillespie, the business manager of the Philadelphia Building Trades Council, which organized much of the picketing, told The Inquirer that the picketing was ''why Philadelphia is a great town.'' 
 At the time, Bunim/Murray seemed on the verge of cooperating and using union laborers, whose wages would have been subsidized by the unions themselves. Then, apparently worried about setting such a precedent, the producers packed up and left. Mr. Gillespie seemed a bit shellshocked at the pro-MTV rally Wednesday evening. 
 ''The venom of some of these television viewers surprises me,'' Mr. Gillespie said. ''They used to say religion was the opiate of the masses. I guess now it's these voyeuristic television programs.''
 But Stephen Starr, whose restaurant Continental West would have provided ''jobs'' for the Philadelphia cast, lamented the turn of events. ''This is one of those popular-culture milestones that Philadelphia would have reached,'' he said. ''There's a few big things that everyone remembers. Like the Republican Convention, or I think the Pope came once. I still remember Kennedy coming and I was 4.''
 At the weekend, an all-out effort to bring back ''The Real World'' had turned political. Mr. Starr had called friends in politics. Sharon Pinkenson of the Greater Philadelphia Film Office, which had spent years courting the show, got in touch with Mayor John Street and the governor's office, urging them to call Bunim/Murray.
 In an interview Friday, Governor Rendell said he had spoken with Joey Carson, the chief operating executive at Bunim/Murray headquarters in Van Nuys, Calif., asking the company to reconsider. 
 ''I just said: 'Listen, whatever decision you decide to make, I want to apologize: there was no excuse for the city allowing that type of behavior from the unions,' '' said Governor Rendell, whose history of wrangling concessions from the city's unions as mayor is the stuff of urban studies legend. Governor Rendell said he expected a decision next week.
 A spokeswoman for the producers, Daniella Cracknell, said: ''Last I heard, we had pulled out. But I think that could change.''

HEADLINE: Through The Roof

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE 

 BODY:
ALBERT W. LIAN fancies himself something of a pioneer. Three decades ago, when other homebuyers were making places like Larchmont and Rye some of the hottest real estate markets in Westchester County, Mr. Lian turned his gaze to New Rochelle, a hot spot from an earlier era that had gone cold.
 ''My wife and I were house-hunting and I said, 'Let's go north,''' recalled Mr. Lian, who was living in Brooklyn before he bought his New Rochelle home in 1971. ''I found this place, about 20 rooms. They couldn't wait to get rid of it. Paid $55,000 for it. It was a good deal.''
 Mr. Lian, now 75, put his house on the market in early March. And that good deal? Well, he figures that today his house could fetch seven figures. ''I put a lot of money into it,'' he said proudly. 
 For years, New Rochelle was the place bargain hunters went for a Westchester County address without paying Westchester County prices. (Bargain, of course, is a relative term in a county where a mid-to-upper-six-figure home has long been the standard in places like Scarsdale.)
 But over the last few years, real estate agents and housing experts say, any bargains that might have remained in New Rochelle have just about vanished. Prices there may never rival Scarsdale's, but real estate agents say some New Rochelle properties have doubled their value since the start of the millennium. The relatively low supply of houses available has meant bidding wars, a reflection of the strong seller's market. Historically low mortgage rates have given an additional boost to prices. People who want to move out of the city to the suburbs to have more room and a different school equation for their children have continued to flood to Westchester and other suburbs. 
 One place where the result is seen is in the census tract that includes New Rochelle, which experienced the county's highest percentage increase in family income from 1990 to 2000, which reflects the higher incomes needed to buy these more expensive houses.
 Home sellers and experts say that another byproduct of this real estate boom is that some middle-class buyers are being priced out of the market before they can even enter it.
 Real estate agents say that while a decent New Rochelle house could be had for about $200,000 as recently as half a decade ago, there's virtually nothing left on the market now for less than $300,000 and the typical price is about $400,000.
 While real estate agents almost giddily describe the sometimes-fevered pitch of the market here, some also feel a twinge of sympathy for those unable to jump into a market that had been a refuge for middle-class and younger buyers.
 ''Easy?'' asked Joanmarie Tully O'Connor, the listing agent for Mr. Lian's home, in response to a question about pitching properties to potential buyers here. ''It's easy for us. It doesn't make it any easier for our first-time buyers. Can you imagine what our kids are going to have to pay?''

The Two Middle Classes
 While the forces at play here in New Rochelle are noteworthy, experts say they are not unique. Neighborhoods all over the metropolitan region are seeing home prices rising so sharply that most of the people who live in them couldn't afford to buy there if they had to do it all over again. Sociologists and economists say it simply costs more for a middle-class family to stay in the middle. Some experts see a widening gulf in the middle of the middle class, separating those who have and those who have more.
 In Westchester County, a place that is routinely referred to as affluent, there are great extremes of wealth and poverty, and then, somewhere in the middle, is a middle class whose definition is at best slippery. Nationally, if a family's annual income is $75,000, by most definitions the family belongs to the middle class. By that standard a low six-figure income would put a Westchester family in the upper middle class nationally -- yet that family may well not be a position to buy a house. 
 ''More and more it's a case of winners and losers in the middle class,'' said Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. ''There are two groups. If you have a secure and steady job, own a home, you can be doing quite well. Then there are all those people who are on a slippery slope who are afraid that they're going to lose their job or that it will go off to India. 
 ''They're the ones who are the forgotten middle class,'' she said.
 Dr. Fainstein said that those most affected by skyrocketing home values in the region are first-time buyers and the young.
 ''The people for whom it's really hard are people just entering the housing market, young couples, people without a nest egg or without parents who can help them,'' she said. ''They're the middle class that's downwardly mobile, because even if you have a decent income, who has $60,000 in the bank for a down payment when they just got out of college or graduate school or wherever?''
 The current tightening of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan region is simple supply and demand. Because there is little affordable housing being built, whatever existing quality housing stock remains is sometimes fought over by prospective buyers with dueling bids.
 All of which serves to price large segments of the middle class out of some real estate markets.
 ''I don't know how people are doing it,'' said Rachel Ranis, a sociology professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. ''It's very hard for any family to buy in this market unless both parties are working.''
 While it has become harder for many to enter the housing market, those who do make it want even more once they get there. 
 ''People's expectations have gotten higher,'' she said. ''Before, we were happy to have just one car in a household. Now, everyone has to have a car. If you buy a house, everyone has to have a room. People have changed a lot.''
 What has remained largely constant, Professor Ranis said, are the forces that drive homebuyers into the suburbs around the region -- the quest for bigger yards, better schools and perhaps a slower, more measured pace of living.
 Professor Ranis noted that another factor appears to be playing a larger role: worry. 
 ''One thing we find is that you're worried that you will be able to duplicate what you've always considered middle class,'' she said. ''The key value is how to keep yourself where you are and your children, how to give them the best start.
 ''There's a lot of pressure on people to keep up with what they're accustomed to,'' she said. ''It's no longer about keeping up with the neighbor next door, it's their own wants and what they're accustomed to.''
 In the status-conscious suburbs, a larger home is still the No. 1 symbol of success.
 ''The ones who are doing well, you see people going out and getting bigger and bigger houses,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''You look at some of these homes that have closets the size of my bedroom when I grew up.''
 And the reason size matters?
 ''It's the symbol of your achievement, the symbol of your status,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''It puts a premium on those homes with the center hall and the chandelier and all this space where you can demonstrate your lifestyle.''
 While practically no one would prefer that a community be poorer rather than richer, some experts wonder about the effects of such changes on the character of established middle-class communities.
 ''All of the suburbs that have maintained quality housing have become more and more exclusive,'' Dr. Fainstein said.
 More exclusive perhaps, but also, some say, communities in high-priced markets grow less diverse and their residents less connected socially.
 ''It has a huge impact on community connectedness,'' said Robert Fisher, the director of urban and community studies at the University of Connecticut's West Hartford campus. ''The issue of social connectedness, a lot of that has to do with destabilization. While bringing affluence into these communities, a lot of people are pushed out as well.''
 Left unmentioned sometimes, Dr. Fisher said, are those who because of high prices never get to enter some communities in the first place. ''What's happening is that the American dream is a little bit less within the reach of a lot of people,'' he said.

Right Address, Best Value
 Carving out a place of one's own has been a part of the makeup of New Rochelle since the first European settlers took note of what was then pristine, arable land here along the banks of Long Island Sound more than 300 years ago. 
 Settled in 1689, New Rochelle was born when John Pell sold more than 6,000 acres of land to the French Huguenots, who came to the New World to escape religious persecution. The town takes its name from the former French Huguenot stronghold, La Rochelle.
 By 1700, the town already had the beginnings of a solid infrastructure - including a constabulary and fence inspectors, according to Barbara Davis, New Rochelle's acting town historian.
 ''It really gave this community a head start,'' said Ms. Davis, who also works as the community relations coordinator at the New Rochelle Public Library.
 And that head start proved vital as, over roughly the next century and half, New Rochelle evolved from a farming community into a mill town and ultimately a resort town by the Sound frequented by tens of thousands of thousands of people from New York City.
 ''So many wealthy Manhattanites came here, saw how great it was, liked it and built their summer homes here,'' Ms. Davis said.
 Toward the latter part of the 19th century, those same Manhattanites began coming to New Rochelle and staying full time. After the founding of the some of the town's earliest neighborhoods like Rochelle Park in the 1880's, people began moving to New Rochelle in droves.
 Between 1900 and 1930, Ms. Davis said, the city's population quadrupled. New Rochelle was reputed to be the wealthiest city in New York State and the third richest in the country.
 Then came the Depression. And while people everywhere suffered, the contrast between suburban life before the stock market crash and after it played out starkly in New Rochelle.
 ''This community was hit especially hard,'' Ms. Davis said, noting that when she combs through city records to trace the history of home ownership in certain areas she would often find only the name of a bank in the space reserved for the owner.
 The city began recovering after World War II, as the G.I. Bill brought in new waves of homeowners and spurred intense development. And since the war, New Rochelle has enjoyed a reputation as less expensive, less homogeneous and less stiff neighbor to more upper-crust communities like Scarsdale.
 ''It's for someone who's attracted to the Scarsdale address but doesn't want to pay that price,'' Ms. Davis said. ''You could get value for your dollar. If you put these houses in Rye it might be $200,000 more.''
 And while the home prices here might never approach those of this city's more upper-class neighbors, New Rochelle residents like Ms. Davis have noticed a perceptible change.
 ''It's really phenomenal what's happened,'' she said.
 The local Orthodox Jewish community is growing, but some real estate agents and others in the community say that the growth here began shortly after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 ''It was the environmental issue, the dust, or they had homes in the area'' directly affected by the attacks, said Connie Caglioti, a real estate agent with Oshlag-Eisner Realty. ''Some were planning to have children and wanted to move, some had children, for some it was such an emotional issue that they wanted to flee.''
 Other experts are reluctant to attribute many of the recent arrivals to 9/11. But the economic factors that are fattening real estate values across the nation are still at work here too, defying widespread expectations that the local market would cool.
 ''We thought the housing market would come to a standstill and prices would go down,'' Ms. Caglioti said. ''They didn't.''
 Not only did the high prices remain, some agents say that many potential buyers try to capitalize on the rising values by ''flipping'' properties - buying homes and selling them quickly to turn a profit.
 ''People buy things, flip them and double their money,'' said Hillary Brizell-DeLise, who sold homes in New Rochelle for five years before recently joining an agency in Manhattan.
 ''Real estate is an investment,'' she said. ''It's very utilitarian. It's been the most secure kind of investment. Who knows what the stock market is going to do?''
 Other draws for the market are New Rochelle's livability (with 72,000 people, it still retains vestiges of a small-town feel), proximity to Manhattan (''45 Minutes From Broadway,'' was the title George M. Cohan, a New Rochelle resident, gave to his 1906 musical about his town) and cultural diversity (according to census figures, the nonwhite population in the census tract that includes New Rochelle doubled to 14 percent in 2000 from about 7 percent in 1990).

The Economics of Diversity
 And in this city that was scarred in the 1960's by one of the nation's first major court-ordered school desegregation cases north of the Mason-Dixon line, some agents concede that the city's diversity is viewed as a weakness by some buyers.
 ''Some people will come into the community because they want their children to grow up in the real world,'' Ms. Brizell-DeLise said. ''And some people will insist that they want a community that has more snobbery.''
 Ms. Brizell-DeLise said that the rising prices have not proved a bar to diversity in the city. She estimates that fully half of her clients when she worked in New Rochelle were members of minority groups.
 To be sure, she said, some people, both members of minority groups and others, were priced out of the market by rising home values. But, she said, usually the most relevant color was green.
 ''The prices, when they spike, they close out a few,'' said Ms. Brizell-DeLise, noting that some -- put off by the prices of stand-alone, single-family homes -- choose condominiums or co-ops instead. ''There are some people who weren't able to buy no matter the background because they couldn't catch a deal.
 ''There are people who are successful in all backgrounds and they are happy to come to New Rochelle,'' she said.
 Census figures show that the city has become more diversified, particularly where Hispanics are concerned. While African-Americans and Asian-Americans experienced modest percentage increases here from 1990 to 2000 -- holding steady at around 19 percent and 3 percent respectively -- the city's Hispanic population doubled and sits at about 21.5 percent.
 Citing that kind of growth, the city and its school district play up the more down-to-earth and culturally diverse aspects of their community. The school district - which agents said is a major selling point for buyers -- is a melange, 44 percent white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic. ''And the rest'' - about 6 percent - ''is just like the United Nations,'' said Linda E. Kelly, the district's superintendent. 
 Besides a more diverse student body, the superintendent said that over the last decade and a half the district has witnessed a sharp increase in the sheer volume of students it serves. Since 1991, the population of the district has increased by almost half - to roughly 11,000 students today from 7,600 then.
 That growth reflects the changes in New Rochelle and, Ms. Kelly said, puts a little pressure on the district to maintain its high standards.
 ''Who was it that said the only problem with being successful is that you have to keep on being successful?'' she said. ''But we try not to look at it as pressure but as an obligation.''

Running to Stay Even
 Whether potential buyers are drawn to New Rochelle for its schools, location or some other reason, Ms. Brizell-DeLise said that they might want to act quickly because at the rate values change here, a home's price tag can grow significantly in the months between when a house-hunt begins and an offer is made.
 ''It's sad in a way because people are feeling ready to move and they start looking and by the time they're ready to buy, things have gotten away from them,'' she said.
 That was what seemed to keep happening to Helene Wald. For nearly three years, she searched for an alternative to the place that she, her husband and daughter were renting in Riverdale, only to see the benchmarks for home prices continue to increase.
 ''You think they're going to get better,'' Ms. Wald, 55, said of the prices. ''But it keeps getting worse.''
 She and her family narrowed their search to a handful of communities before settling in Eastchester, not far from New Rochelle. It was a 50-year-old home that needed a little work. But, besides being in a good school district, it fit another very important criteria for Ms. Wald.
 ''It was under $500,000,'' she said. ''And to find that in Westchester County is almost unheard of these days. To find a house in the mid-400's is getting harder and harder.''
 Since the family - first-time homebuyers - moved in last fall, they've been mostly about the business of renovation. New carpets. New kitchen. But they're also finding a range of new suburban experiences.
 ''As an owner, I'm kind of a late bloomer,'' she said. ''I'm learning about gardening, trying to get used to shoveling snow.''

Waiting for the Right Offer
 Albert Lian hopes that the market holds at least another late bloomer or two.
 He and his wife, Joan, raised their four children in New Rochelle in the decades after they first spotted the good buy on Lovell Road. Now, the children are all grown and gone. Mrs. Lian died in 1995, and Mr. Lian finds himself alone with his memories.
 ''I'm sitting here by myself in 19 rooms,'' Mr. Lian said. ''Would you stay here?''
 If Mr. Lian had his druthers, he would rather be at the exclusive Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, where he is a member. ''I used to be scratch,'' he said. ''Now I'm about a 14 handicap.''
 A former corporate personal injury defense lawyer who worked in Manhattan, Mr. Lian came to New Rochelle 30 years ago for the same reasons buyers continue to find themselves drawn to this corner of Westchester County today - schools and the commute, which he found was even better than Mr. Cohan's estimates.
 ''I was in New York in a half hour,'' he said. ''I didn't even get a chance to finish the paper.''
 After retiring several years ago, Mr. Lian noticed that there was a growing distance between himself and his neighbors, some of whom are new arrivals. ''I live in this beautiful house and I don't even know my next-door neighbors,'' he said.
 That distance and the loss of several close friends convinced him it was time to move. ''I'm losing a lot of guys,'' he said. ''Everybody's dying on me.''
 So these days he mostly shows prospective buyers around his proud old home - the antique furniture that was passed down from his parents, the expensive rugs - and waiting for the right offer.
 Mr. Lian said he hopes to remain in the area. He expects that he'll use the money from the sale of his house to buy a condominium. He's not looking for anything fancy. Just something close to Winged Foot.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe's White Farmers Start Anew in Zambia

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE

DATELINE: CHISAMBA, Zambia 

 BODY:
Douglas Watt is part of a most curious diaspora in Southern Africa: prosperous white farmers, vilified as greedy racists and driven out of Zimbabwe, looking for a home.
 Mr. Watt left the country of his birth about a year ago after what has become a common sort of encounter there. The husband of a worker in the office of President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe politely told Mr. Watt that he was taking over his farm and that Mr. Watt had 90 days to get out.
 Today Mr. Watt is one of about 140 white Zimbabwean farmers who have relocated to neighboring Zambia hoping, many say, for a mix of racial harmony and political stability that will enable them to prosper and contribute to black Africa. 
 For the farmers and for the Zambian government, the migration amounts to a new experiment on an issue central to the whole region: how do whites fit in?
 While Zimbabwe has been uprooting its white farmers in an aggressive effort to redistribute colonial era landholdings, Zambian officials, if a trifle warily, have rolled out the welcome mat. They are hoping that farmers like Mr. Watt will breathe new life into the nation's moribund farming economy, which has been mired at the rake-and-hoe level since the mid-1970's.
 For their part, some transplanted farmers say they have learned from their experience in Zimbabwe that they need to integrate, not just prosper, if they want to be accepted.
 Mr. Watt drove around Zambia for three weeks before he found 1,600 acres to lease near this one-street village with a post office, police station and food market north of Lusaka, the capital. Pasture and brush a year ago, the gently rolling land is now five feet high in green tobacco plants tended by 240 workers. Huge yellow sheaves of tobacco are hung to cure in 15 shiny sheds by a new blocklong warehouse.
 Mr. Watt has sunk $900,000 into his new farm, most of it borrowed from a bank and from the Universal Leaf Tobacco Company, based in Richmond, Va. ''I have put every cent I have into this,'' Mr. Watt, 38, said, sitting in the dining room of his new ranch-style house. ''I've got more invested here than I ever did in Zimbabwe. We will be an asset to the country.''
 Mr. Watt's move continues a long pattern of whites, increasingly uncertain of their welcome, who have hopscotched around the southern end of Africa in the last four decades. 
 His shift reverses that of his parents, 40 years ago. Back when this Texas-size nation was still called Northern Rhodesia and chafed under colonial rule, Roy and Ria Watt grew tobacco and corn on 4,000 lush acres. In 1964, when white minority rule crumbled and the country became Zambia, the Watts, fearful of their future under a new black-led government, fled to Zimbabwe. Today their son is convinced that his parents bet on the wrong country.
 Douglas Watt describes Zambia as everything that Zimbabwe is no longer: racially tolerant, law-abiding and moderate. It had been desperate for investment after disastrous postindependence economic policies reduced the nation to a beggar for foreign handouts and loans. Critics say President Mugabe's policies in Zimbabwe are creating the same conditions for disaster there today.
 Also unlike Zimbabwe, or South Africa for that matter, Zambia has good land in abundance: about 60 percent of the countryside is arable, but less than 10 percent is actively farmed. In a country of 10 million, there are no more than 450 commercial farmers, including the Zimbabweans.
 ''We think there is a large vacuum to fill,'' said Chance Kabaghe, deputy minister for agriculture, in an interview in a dilapidated office building in Lusaka. ''That's why we have been so open.''
 Still, he added: ''We are encouraging them to respect our norms and mix with the local people. We are watching the situation very closely.''
 For Zambia, the white farmers' money and knowledge may help the nation climb out of the hole it fell into with the decline of its copper mines and nationalization of land after independence.
 Aided by open government policies on leasing and investment -- and by America's tobacco industry, which is underwriting much of the farm-building -- farmers like Mr. Watt are already creating a more modest version of Zimbabwe's once mighty tobacco industry, which has been left in ruins after three years of land seizures.
 Zambia is taking up some of the slack, doubling its tobacco production this year. By 2008, analysts predict, it will produce 82 million pounds of flue-cured tobacco a year. That is twice the yield of that in the mid-1970's, before farmland was nationalized, but still far less than Zimbabwe and Malawi each produce now. 
 Government officials see a new revenue stream of fees and taxes, plus the potential for fertilizer stores, irrigation equipment and maybe even a tobacco processing plant like the one now operating at a quarter of its capacity in Zimbabwe.
 ''We think we have benefited from the farmers who have come in,'' Mr. Kabaghe said. ''We are very proud of them. Our tobacco industry is now booming.'' 
 At the same time, no official here wants the success of white farmers to be too visible, lest it engender the sort of racial backlash that has helped spur Zimbabwe's land takeovers and that is building in both South Africa and Namibia.
 Nor do the tobacco companies want to be seen as the benefactors only of whites. Universal Leaf says it wants to develop 40 to 50 smaller, black-owned commercial farms on the periphery of the white-owned farms -- a move Mr. Rusch says makes both political and economic sense.
 Campbell Dunlop, a 42-year-old farmer, is not certain how it will all work out. He has lived for 18 months next to his tobacco fields in a safari-style hut off a heavily rutted, half-flooded road near Chisamba. But he left his wife and children in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, calculating that he might eventually go back after turning over his new 395-acre farm to Zambian managers to run. 
 ''I haven't got my head around making this home,'' he said.
 Like many of his compatriots here, Mr. Dunlop is haunted by his losses in Zimbabwe. He and other migrants say they find comfort as far-flung neighbors, united by their two-way radios, their memories of 90-day eviction notices and their sense of outrage over the lack of world reaction to Mr. Mugabe.
 A few of their old workers have followed them. Dzingai Kapondoro, 33, worked for 15 years for a white tobacco farmer in Zimbabwe. After Mr. Mugabe's forces evicted the farmer and carved up the farm, Mr. Kapondoro's delighted family were the proud new owners of 25 acres. But while he had skills, Mr. Kapondoro said, he had no equipment to till the land or money for fertilizer and seed. With 25 acres of barren farmland and no income, he finally followed the farm's former white manager to Mr. Dunlop's farm in Zambia. Now he grades tobacco and lives in a thatched hut hundreds of miles from his wife and four children.
 Douglas Watt says it is a relief, a joy even, to feel welcome again. Barely a year ago, during his final days as a Zimbabwe farmer, he recalled, his own workers barricaded him and his wife in their farmhouse for 18 hours. 
 With shouts and a clamor of drums, they demanded that he make good on the Mugabe government's promise of compensation for the fact that the Watts' forced eviction from their farm would leave them jobless.
 During his first weeks in Zambia last year, his workers raised a different sort of ruckus. They were celebrating the first time in their lives that many of them had been paid.
 ''You could hear the party across the river,'' he said. ''The drums beat for two days. It was actually a wonderful feeling.''

HEADLINE: From Gauls to Ducasse, French Made Easy

BYLINE: By ANN PRINGLE-HARRIS. 
ANN PRINGLE-HARRIS writes frequently about travel.

 BODY:
IN the beginning, the French created food. The neighborhood bistro, the brasserie, the literary cafe and the three-star restaurant quite naturally followed. That's more or less how I might have summarized the development of French cuisine before I attended classes in la gastronomie Francaise at a language school in Paris last summer.
 My goal was to achieve true fluency, to move past the stage of simultaneous translation of English thoughts and into the realm of spontaneous French speech. I reasoned that approaching the language through stimulating subject matter -- through the palate, for example -- might take me further than more conversation-plus-grammar courses. I longed for the ease and eloquence the French have when they talk about food. I yearned to rhapsodize over confit d'oie, chanterelles and fraises des bois. I hoped to overcome my neurotic dependency on the proper tense and the appropriate idiom.
 After a bit of investigation I found a two-week course in the development of French cuisine at l'Institut Parisien de Langue et de Civilisation Francaises, in the 15th Arrondissement, that seemed to offer what I was looking for. (The hours for the course have since been reduced to 6 from 15.) 
 On the first morning of classes we were a group of about eight students, from England, Japan, Spain and the United States. The Spanish contingent, under the mistaken impression that they would be preparing French meals, withdrew when it was explained that they would be surveying the rise of French cuisine from the Gauls to Alain Ducasse. We then had a companionable group of four, plus Nadia Zanon, our instructor. We gathered in a large, simple classroom, with plenty of windows but, unfortunately, no air-conditioning. Journal articles, excerpts from classic texts, and some slides and film clips provided a basis for Nadia's lively, informal lectures and for class discussion -- entirely in French. 
 The few facts I thought I knew about French gastronomic history proved not to be facts. ''Dishes in the early Middle Ages were very highly spiced,'' Nadia told us. She paused, and I jumped right in: ''No refrigeration. They had to disguise the taste of meat that had gone bad.'' I was sure I had read that somewhere.
 Not, apparently, in the correct scholarly texts. According to food historians, medieval cooks had a specific system for producing tasty, edible, healthful meats: ''faire faisander la viande,'' which involved aging the flesh until it reached the stage of near-decay, then purifying it through a boiling process designed to destroy the bacteria. Why, then, the quantities of cinnamon (cannelle) and other seasonings that records show were added? 
 The answer seems to be that diners of that day simply liked spicy food.
 As to the evolution of restaurants, the first and basic stage was street food. Scholars say that the earliest commercial food service, in European countries as well as in Africa and Asia, was a rolling cart stocked with prepared edibles. In France, this medieval fast food was generally hot bouillon, eaten by peasants and artisans who worked long hours out of doors and away from home. Essentially a meat-and-vegetable puree, the bouillon was taken to restore oneself: se restaurer. 
 Hence the word restaurant.
 Having my misinformation corrected and my bits of knowledge expanded upon in a friendly but rigorous classroom setting not only loosened my tongue, it also gave me new words and a broader understanding of those I already had.
 ''Un petit devoir,'' announced Nadia one morning. Normally we had no homework to speak of, but on that day we were asked to look up the word ''entremets'' in whatever dictionary or other source we had at hand. To me, entremets was something light, sweet and delicious, specifically a sherbet I had eaten at age 3 when my parents took me out to a fancy restaurant in St. Louis. I remember wondering why I was allowed to eat dessert in the middle of dinner.
 Entremets in medieval France was something altogether different: an elaborate show in which singers, dancers and jugglers cavorted about in an effort to entertain diners impatient for the next parts of their meal.
 Those parts weren't yet courses. The practice of serving meals in courses, according to Nadia, didn't take hold until the 17th century. Before that, meals were organized around four to six large tables presented one after the other, each one filled with dishes of all types and tastes and seasoned in paired complementary flavors (parfums): sweet-salty, bitter-mild. Diners chose small quantities, like tasting portions, of each dish. We would call it grazing.
 PEOPLE grazed with their fingers. Formal eating utensils came to France via Italy. Catherine de' Medici, a woman I associate more with palace intrigue than with tableware, is said to have introduced the fork -- la fourchette -- to France at the time of her marriage to the future King Henri II in 1533. Earlier, the French had simply scooped up their food onto hunks of bread called tranchoirs. This word took me again back to my childhood, to a set of infant silverware passed down in my father's family. It included a knifelike utensil called a trencher, or a pusher, apparently used to push food from the dish onto a small spoon or fork.
 All tourists in France have seen them in urban and provincial restaurants: parents, children and grandparents dining en famille, enjoying their meal as they engage in conversation, the children behaving well while still behaving like children. How do French families do it? Nadia introduced us to the views of the historian Jean-Robert Pitte, who writes that from the beginning -- at any rate from the time of the Gauls -- the pleasure of eating was linked, in France, to the pleasure of conversation and discussion, and the notion that children should be seen and not heard apparently never caught on. 
 The cafe as a place of political and intellectual exchange obviously did catch on. The first one, Le Procope, near the Theatre de l'Odeon, opened in Paris in 1686 and is still in operation. I was surprised to find, though, that the exclusive, expensive, sought-after restaurant -- the kind that visitors to France book months, or years, in advance -- owes its existence to the French Revolution, and was in part inspired by the English.
 In the 17th century, Nadia told us, London was famous for luxurious dining establishments, called taverns, that were favored by English lords when they lodged in London instead of languishing on their country estates. The Revolution in France left unemployed the chefs of many aristocratic French families whose members had lost their chateaus or their heads or both. With no landed gentry left to cook for, the private chefs went public. They looked to the London tavern as a model for their new establishments because there was a vogue at the time for ''le style Anglais.''
 By the end of classes, we students were conversing like old friends. I was eager to practice my new skills in places I had been to on my first Paris visit, when my aim was over the moon and my oral fluency in the basement. At the Deux Magots, the Left Bank cafe facing St.-Germain-des-Pres on one side, outdoor tables on a mild evening were filled with handsome young French men and women, just as they had been for decades. I couldn't pick up much from their conversations -- too many were going on at once -- but I had the sense, possibly wishful, of being at home in their language.
 Later, I met a friend for dinner at Lipp, the celebrated brasserie that I recalled as specializing not only in Alsatian foods but also in dour, intimidating maitres d'hotel who in years past had reduced my French to mumbled monosyllables. The one on duty that night fit the mold, but I plunged in and made known our presence and our seating preference: a table downstairs instead of one in nowhere-land upstairs. When we were shown to an excellent downstairs table, I allowed myself a moment of pride and self-congratulation on my new and improved French -- until I saw the maitre d' and my friend exchanging a hearty handshake.
 ''It's wonderful, he never forgets,'' said my friend later. It seems that she, a former United Nations translator, taught English to his brother-in-law.

HEADLINE: Guadeloupe, Sleepy Idyll No More

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL. 
FRANK J. PRIAL is a reporter and wine columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
THEY are building a four-lane highway here on Guadeloupe, a lovely French Caribbean island. When it is finished, it will connect the busy port city of Point-a-Pitre with Basse-Terre, the sleepy political capital some 40 miles away. Time was, not so long ago, when you drove to Basse-Terre along the old coast road, through somnolent villages like Goyave and Trois-Rivieres, stopping here and there under towering palm trees to buy some fruit or just to look at the sea. The trip might take two hours more if you got stuck behind an ox cart.
 The new road bypasses the villages and the beaches and will probably get you down to Basse-Terre in 40 minutes. 
 Traffic on the completed strip is already too heavy and fast to allow time to look at anything but the speedometer and the billboards reminding you that the European Union is footing much of the construction bill. I knew there was something about the Union that ticked me off. 
 The new highway ends abruptly 23 miles out and you are back in old Guadeloupe, sort of. Just off to your left, earthmovers are finishing the job, smashing through the banana trees and flattening the red volcanic soil for the asphalt to come.
 It's painful watching a tropical coastline turn into a major highway, but it is also hypocritical to begrudge the Guadeloupeans conveniences, like decent roads, that we take for granted. And, much as this tourist might dislike it, the road is symbolic of a new Guadeloupe.
 Guadeloupe is not a half-forgotten colonial backwater like many of the islands. It is a departement of France, bearing an even closer relationship to that country than, say, Puerto Rico does to the United States. French law prevails, the country's legendarily generous social benefits are available to all, and French culture is carefully nurtured. In two weeks here in December, except in one of the luxury hotels, I heard not a single word of English.
 To accomplish all this requires a substantial governmental infrastructure. It is fully in place in Guadeloupe, and to staff it, there is an established middle class. Hospitals, schools, police stations, gendarmerie barracks, city halls and municipal offices all look just as they would in France, and they are staffed by doctors, lawyers, policemen, social workers, teachers and civil servants.
 This is nothing new. Guadeloupe was declared a D.O.M. (Departement-Outre-Mer), or Overseas Department, in 1946 and, along with its sister island, Martinique, has enjoyed that status ever since. 
 What has changed over the years is the makeup of the middle class. As late as the 1980's, most of the government offices and bureaus were staffed by whites, both Metros, as the mainland French are called, and Bekes, as native whites are known. Now, whites are a diminishing presence. Economic power may emanate from France, but the middle class on the island makes it work, and that middle class today is mostly black.
 To cater to this relatively affluent group are shopping malls, immense supermarkets and, on the highways into and out of Pointe-a-Pitre, dazzling auto showrooms -- not just for French brands like Renault and Peugeot, but for Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volvo. Driving schools are everywhere, as are their cars, most often with women learning at the wheel.
 To a visitor returning to Guadeloupe after 15 years, these changes are remarkable. But none of them so remarkable as the virtual disappearance of that multicolored, raucous bird, the American tourist. There was once a tourist office in New York, just for the French West Indies, and for a time it seemed that everyone on the island was studying English. Hotels that couldn't find an English-speaker to work the front desk brought one over, often illegally, from Antigua, the next island up the chain.
 It never worked out. Most resort islands strive to be what their visitors want them to be. The French, being French, assumed visitors came to enjoy French culture. Serving bacon and eggs to people in Hawaiian garb was not French.
 Americans came to the two Club Meds, one at Ste.-Anne for self-styled swingers, one out at Deshaies for families. But the Club Med experience in those days was hermetically sealed. Guests arrived on charter flights, spent their week within the club's confines and were then shipped home. Only the Ste.-Anne club remains, and it rarely advertises in the United States. For a time, the Deshaies club even became base for a battalion of the feared C.R.S. riot police, deployed from France in the 1980's during a period of separatist unrest.
 THE airlines have done little to make travel to Guadeloupe attractive to Americans. In the late 1960's, there was regular nonstop service from New York to Pointe-a-Pitre. Today Air France serves Guadeloupe from Miami; American Eagle from San Juan. With the layover, the trip from the New York area takes about seven hours each way, and the fare is around $700, more than many round-trip fares to Paris.
 With an area of some 687 square miles, Guadeloupe is the largest of the French Caribbean islands. It is actually a group of islands. The French half of St. Martin, 150 miles to the northwest, and St.-Barthelemy next to it, are dependencies of Guadeloupe. So are Les Saintes, a group of smallish islands off Guadeloupe's southern tip; Marie-Galante, an island 25 miles south of Pointe-a-Pitre; and La Desirade, once a leper colony, out in the Atlantic off Pointe-des-Chateaux, Guadeloupe's easternmost extremity.
 The out-islands, particularly those clustered around Guadeloupe, preserve some of its colonial charm, mostly because, except for Marie-Galante, they are relatively free of cars. Guadeloupe traffic is nightmarish; the accident toll is high. Speeds are posted but the signs, along with those saying ''Stop the Slaughter on Our Roads,'' are ignored.
 Guadeloupe is still a spectacular place to see from a car. But while a leisurely drive through the cane fields to some favorite seaside restaurant once made for a perfect day, now even on an empty two-lane road, seemingly out of nowhere, a car will suddenly appear in the rear view mirror, literally inches from your rear fender, demanding that you speed up or get out of the way. Passing on blind curves is routine. The gendarmes seem to patrol the roads rarely; they confine themselves to ''controls,'' stopping a line of cars to check documents.
 Not long ago, Vespas and motorbikes made up most of the road traffic, and it was fun to drive. No longer. I can't blame the local guys for wanting to tear around. I just don't want to get in their way.
 For one Francophile, Guadeloupe's attraction had always been twofold. Make that three. It was close, the beaches were superb and the food was French. The beaches are still superb and, except near the hotels, can be long and wide and blissfully empty. But the island is not so close anymore; the airlines have seen to that. And the food, while still French, is island French. 
 Don't get me wrong. Ever conscious -- sometimes grudgingly -- of their French heritage, the Guadeloupeans are inordinately proud of their food. And with good reason. Freshly caught fish in court bouillon; broiled lobsters; steamed ouassous, the crayfish from Basse-Terre's mountain streams; crab farci; spicy little beignets called accras -- even at simple restaurants, they are all incomparable. There is also curried goat and chicken Colombo, gifts of the island's strong East Indian population. I'm told there are some great Vietnamese restaurants as well.
 But classic French dishes, even a simple poulet roti or a good baguette, are now hard to come by. The grizzled old Frenchmen I remember, mostly World War II veterans, who ran the little cafes and bistros and embodied the old French connection, are gone, often replaced by talented young Guadeloupeans eager to celebrate the island's own cuisine. One major vote of confidence for the new Guadeloupe comes from the French themselves. Tourists from the Hexagone, as they refer to France, flock to the island, more than making up for any loss of North Americans. Of course, they do get a better fare.
 So, then, what is it to be? Vestiges of the old colonial days? Little outposts of a bygone Paris or Marseille? Or a new Guadeloupe generation, eager to fulfill its own destiny, to assert its own values, in cars, in food, in everything else?
 I think I've answered my own questions. Still, I have to admit, it would have been great to find, unchanged, that little Nicoise place that made such great bouillabaisse.

Traffic, malls, and beaches too

Getting There
 Air France runs the only flight to Guadeloupe from the mainland United States. It leaves Miami three days a week at 8:15 a.m., makes one stop in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and arrives at Pole Caraibe, the new airport in Pointe-a-Pitre, at 1:40 p.m. Return to Miami departs 4:45 p.m. and arrives 8:30 p.m. three days a week. Information: (800) 237-2747 and www.airfrance.com.us. American Eagle has a daily flight from San Juan, P.R., at 12:50 p.m. arriving at Pointe-a-Pitre at 2:30 p.m. The return flight leaves at 3 p.m., arriving at San Juan at 4:48 p.m. Information: (800) 433-7300; www.aa.com. 
 On the island, taxis are expensive. But every major car rental company and a dozen local companies are represented; prices are competitive. 

Where to Stay
 Most hotels, indeed most tourist activities, center on the village of Gosier, on Grande Terre, about five miles east of Pointe-a-Pitre. One of the oldest hotels and probably the best luxury establishment is the Sofitel Auberge de la Vieille Tour, Montauban, (590) 590 84 23 23, fax (590) 590 84 33 43, www.accorhotels.com, with 148 rooms and 32 suites; a double is $240 to $400, at $1.26 to the euro. 
 Nearby, the 145 rooms at the Cannella Beach, (590) 590 90 44 00, fax (590) 590 90 44 44, have kitchenettes, and there is a restaurant and a small beach. A double is $135 to $190. 
 The 384-room Creole Beach Hotel, Pointe de la Verdur, (590) 590 90 46 46, fax (590) 590 90 46 66, www.leader-hotels.gp, has tropical gardens and a beach. Doubles are $224. 
 On Basse-Terre, the mountainous side of Guadeloupe, hotels tend to be smaller and hidden in the lush forest. I like the Hotel Creol' Inn, (590) 590 94 22 56, fax (590) 590 94 19 28, www.hotel-creolin-guadeloupe.com, in Tabanon -- not far from Petit Bourg, north of Goyave -- a little colony of cottages grouped around an attractive pool. There is a good restaurant specializing, as do most Guadeloupean restaurants, in seafood, Creole style. Each room has a terrace, kitchen area, rattan furnishings. Doubles are $80 to $100. 
 A lovely new small hotel near the southern tip of Basse-Terre is the Jardin Malanga, in Trois Rivieres, (590) 590 92 67 57, fax (590) 590 92 67 58, www.im-caraibes.com/leader-hotels. A converted 1927 colonial mansion, with three two-bedroom cottages, it has some of the island's most spectacular views out toward Les Saintes. Doubles are $217 to $272; suites $240 to $400. 

Where to Eat
 Prices are for one, without wine.
 Good restaurants include La Poisson d'Or in Port Louis, Boulevard Achille Renee Boisneuf, (590) 590 22 88 63, serving grilled fish, fricassee of ouassous (crayfish), and grilled spiny lobster; $25. 
 Restaurant Clara, (590) 590 28 72 99, in Ste.-Rose, serves chicken legs with lambis (shells), Colombo of ray fish, fricassee of spiny lobster; $40. 
 The Villa Fleur d'Epee, Rue du Fort Fleur d'Epee, (590) 590 90 86 59, fax (590) 590 90 73 01, www.im-caraibes.com/fleurdepee, in Gosier, is probably the most elegant (very French) little place on the island; on the menu are shrimp tails of Reunion, diced beef with sate, vivaneau in a sauce brule gueule; $65. 
 And the Iguane Cafe, on Route de la Pointe-des-Chateaux, (590) 590 88 61 37, outside St.-Francois, offers ravioli of ouassous, spiny lobster with fennel, sweetbreads and shrimp with saffron; $65.

 BODY:
New Jersey ranked fourth in the nation in job growth last year, according to figures released last week by the State Labor Department. The top three were Florida, Nevada and Arizona. 
 Albert G. Kroll, the labor commissioner, said New Jersey added 25,500 jobs in 2003, the largest increase of any state in the Northeast. Over the last 12 months, the state has added 33,400 jobs.
 The state's unemployment rate stood at 5.4 percent in February, below the national average of 5.6 percent. Service jobs led the gains in the past few months, with increases in business services and hotel and leisure-related jobs. Construction jobs also increased in January, although they retreated somewhat last month. Health care employment declined, primarily due to cutbacks at several hospitals. The state also saw a gain of several hundred manufacturing jobs since December. John Sullivan

JESSE McKINLEY reports on the performing arts for The Times.

 BODY:
WITH all due respect to the road builders of the Caribbean, the longest stretch of unblemished asphalt in Providenciales, the most developed island of the Turks and Caicos chain, may just be its airport runway, a welcoming stretch of concrete that I found myself staring down at on a bright and sunny Christmas Eve.
 The occasion was a weeklong holiday with my wife, Lindsey, and her family, a trip that I felt I had both lucked into -- my father-in-law is a generous man -- and earned the hard way. Winter, of course, had started early in New York City this last year, with December blizzards and the type of cold that makes you envy animals with fur. In short, nothing sounded better than a little sun for the new son-in-law.
 That sun has been the principal appeal of Provo, as it is called by residents and visitors, for most of its history, the recorded portion of which began in early 17th century. That's when a succession of French, Spanish, British and Bermudan explorers took turns occupying the island and interacting with the native Taino Indians, who were there when Columbus arrived. (The islands are now a British colony administered by a governor appointed by the queen.) 
 Situated at the southern tip of the Bahamas, 575 miles southeast of Miami, the Turks and Caicos, made up of 8 inhabited and some 40 small and uninhabited keys, had little to offer in natural resources (until the late 60's, salt was its biggest export). But it did have the type of crystalline Caribbean water and long, white beaches that seem to exist only in beer ads and the fantasies of winter-battered mainlanders. In recent years, celebrities like Bruce Willis and Donna Karan have built private villas on Parrot Cay, a 20-minute boat ride northeast from Provo. 
 Those bleached beaches and blue-on-blue waters now serve as backdrop for a string of resorts along Provo's Grace Bay, a gentle 12-mile crescent on the island's northern shore whose eastern half includes a number of resorts, including a Club Med and a Beaches. Among the dozen or so other resorts of various levels of luxury is the Grace Bay Club, a high-end, 21-suite hotel where we were staying.
 But while those resorts might suggest overdevelopment, what is fascinating about Provo is that it seems to be a place where everything is either in the state of being built up or torn down. New houses pepper the arid, brush filled hills all over the island, including some whopping mansions on its southern coast, and the well-appointed Provo Golf and Country Club fills the interior of the eastern end. The island's sheer natural beauty is complemented by an array of fancy restaurants and decked-out visitors looking for excellent scuba diving (check), fresh seafood (check), or just a sunburn (check, ouch, check). 
 At the same time, however, half-built, seemingly abandoned cinder block buildings are also visible along many roads, as is the occasional rusted-out car. The local economy remains highly dependent on tourism, and the recent recession-and-terror-inspired slump seems to have taken a bite out of it. 
 Nowhere is that mix more evident than underfoot, or more precisely, under tire. Simply put, roads on Provo often leave something to be desired, making life hard on those with kidney problems, an aversion to bumps, or plain old car sickness. Street signs are also at a minimum. 
 That ruggedness, however, can also prove inviting to those adventurous enough to take to the secondary roads, where some of the island's best food and most beautiful beaches can be found. (In the island's defense, many of the main roads are paved and other lesser roads are in the process of being improved, according to the Turks and Caicos Tourism Board.) I spent two days seeking out a far-flung strip of sand on the west end called Malcolm Beach, which required two different cars, a lot of stops for directions, and one very patient wife.
 My trip began at J.F.K., from which American Airlines flies three times a week direct to Provo. Having left on a frigid morning, we found ourselves on the toasty beach by afternoon. 
 We had gone there a year before as well, and I didn't, from my beach seat, notice many changes. Some new villas were being built, yes, but over all, very little had seemingly changed. The Grace Bay Club, with its lovely dipping pool, courteous staff and excellent restaurant (Anacoana), were all as good as I remembered.
 This trip around, however, I rented a car and had a powerful itch to see some sights. Of which, according to most of the island's guidebooks and magazines, there are about two above the waterline, including something called the Hole, a giant limestone, well, hole that is remarkably hard to find (one tiny sign) and remarkably unprotected (I nearly fell in). That, and the island's conch farm -- are about it in terms of organized sightseeing.
 Water activities, however, are another story, with all manner of tour boats, sailboats, wave-runners, windsurfers, banana rides, fishing expeditions and scuba trips. Many of these leave from the resorts, but the island also has two main marinas: Leeward, at the island's eastern tip, part of a Palm Beach-meets-Venice Beach-style development (it is, not surprisingly, the jumping off point for Parrot Cay); and Turtle Cove, mid-island, where yachts often back up against smaller fishing boats and the occasional dinghy.
 The beaches around the island vary. Grace Bay's sand is fine, white and rock free. The harder-to-find Long Bay, on the eastern side of the island, is rougher and more windswept, with conch shells poking through the sand and shallow waves. 
 And on beaches along the more exclusive southern coast, where Dick Clark has a home, beachcombers can choose between the warm knee-deep water of the shallow seaward bays or the even more balmy Chalk Sound National Park, an eerily blue lagoon. 
 And then there's Malcolm Beach. Now, I have no idea who Malcolm was, but he apparently didn't like company. 
 The beach, which I tried to find on my third day, is on the far western coast, the least commercially developed part of the island that is also home to many native residents. Not surprisingly, it is also home to several of its best spots for good, cheap food, including the best roadside, beachside conch shack I've ever been to: Bugaloo. 
 In what's called the Blue Hills district, Bugaloo's decor and approach is simple: A pink shack, a little bigger than a bus shelter, surrounded by hundreds of pink and gray conch shells, three tables, and a grill. There are three or four basic varieties of conch fritters -- grilled, slaw, etc. -- and occasionally a lobster or two available. The food comes out of the water, and onto the plate. 
 There's beer, a view and a steady wind off the water. You could do much, much worse. 
 It was after a trip to Bugaloo's that I made my first attempt at Playa de Malcolm, which is probably only three miles away as the pelican flies. Problem is, I was driving. 
 About halfway down the dirt road leading to Malcolm's, I was confronted with a series of foot-deep ruts and tire-swallowing craters that my car (and Lindsey) wasn't ready for. I retreated to the main road, and back at the Grace Bay Club began almost immediately to salve my defeat with a series of fruity tropical drinks, of which Provo offers many. 
 Eating and drinking may, in fact, be the principal excitement for visitors The best places for these activities seem to be in Grace Bay, including Caicos Cafe, a popular open-air spot that features big crowds and bigger margaritas; Coco Bistro, opened in 1993 by Yves Coutisson, a Frenchman, with a large back patio, palm trees and a Mediterranean flavor; and Coyaba, another garden spot with an extensive wine list and an emphasis on Caribbean cuisine. 
 Not surprisingly, most restaurants or cafes emphasize Caribbean cuisine, and some of the menus can start to seem interchangeable. (And if you don't like seafood, or $20 entrees, Provo may not be for you.) Other places have their own special appeal, like the Magnolia restaurant, a picturesque spot with a large deck on top on one of the highest hills on Provo, perhaps the best place on the island to watch the sun set. 
 There are a few varieties on the Caribbean theme, including a pretty decent Italian place, Bella Luna, which is good for families; and Danny Buoy's, a bona fide Irish bar, which is good for those avoiding their families. Other than that, night life hasn't really invaded Provo yet, despite a few attempts, including a slot-heavy casino (at the Allegro resort) and Stardust, a big open-air nightclub off the main highway where Friday night revelers stay up till dawn. Bars close early on Saturday in deference to the island's Sunday churchgoers.
 It was on just such a Sunday morning that I intended to try to make it to Malcolm Beach again, this time in a 4x4 my father-in-law had rented. But I was confronted by something I least expected: rain. Lots of rain. Buckets of rain, proving that even in the Caribbean winter does exist. 
 I got no farther than the parking lot before realizing that those ruts in the road would be mud streams and even in a 4x4, my odds weren't especially good. 
 I retreated onto Grace Bay and waited for the sun to come out, which it did, trying to remember my new maxim: a beach in hand is better than one just out of reach. (My brother-in-law later successfully made the trip and told me rapturous tales of Malcolm's striking windswept beaches and its cool, shade-giving huts.)
 Still, as the plane climbed from the runway the next day, I was teased by the allure of that beach and of Provo itself. That elusiveness, in many ways, lies at the heart of the island's appeal: a place that's neither quite done or quite done for, still under construction and underexposed. 
 Whether through zoning, economic hardship or sheer good luck, Provo has thus far managed to avoid much of the tackiness and crowding of other Caribbean hot spots. Whether it can maintain that that remains to be seen. 
 Of course, there's only one way to find out. And next year, by golly, I'm renting a Jeep.

HEADLINE: Town in Montana Wilderness Is Divided Over Drilling Plan

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

 BODY:
In Blackleaf Canyon just north of Choteau, Mont., where the rolling prairie turns suddenly into serrated, snow-mottled mountains, a natural gas plant sits shuttered and silent.
 It is one of the few signs of industry in the vast, wind-whipped region of Montana known as the Rocky Mountain Front, high plains that extend for 150 miles from the Canadian border to just north of Helena, the capital, an area so wild and rich in wildlife that it draws frequent comparisons to the Serengeti and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
 Falling gas prices ended the short-lived boom in the area in the 1980's, but now prices are high again, and some residents of Choteau, a tiny town 100 miles north of Helena, are hoping for a new boom. They want to bring back the drilling rigs and reopen the processing plant and pipelines to take to market the natural gas that lies buried at the base of the mountains. 
 The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, the federal agencies that manage some 40,000 acres that would be affected, recently began an environmental study to determine if drilling should resume. 
 ''I'd like to see them drill,'' said Carl Field, a longtime real estate broker and land manager with a cluttered storefront office on Choteau's quiet main street. Gas production, Mr. Field said, ''could help everyone around here, from suppliers to contractors, motels and grocery stores.''
 For many, however, the prospect of drilling on the Front again is sacrilege. A combination of federal lands and vast private ranches, the Front is undeveloped, and because it is much lower in altitude than the mountains that tower over it, it provides a crucial winter refuge for wildlife.
 ''How can someone take an area of this magnificence and sell it down the river for a few minutes of natural gas supply?'' said Stoney Burk, a real estate lawyer with an office in a log cabin on the other side of Choteau's main thoroughfare. ''It has the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the Northwest, the second largest migrating elk herd, the biggest population of grizzlies outside of the parks, as well as eagles, wolves, cougars and other wildlife.''
 Gloria Flora, the former supervisor of the Lewis and Clark National Forest, who in 1997 placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on publicly owned land in the region, agreed. ''Full-scale development on the Rocky Mountain Front would be nothing short of a disaster,'' Ms. Flora said. She now leads a coalition of conservationists trying to stop the new proposals.
 Conservationists say the energy bill now stalled in the Senate would greatly speed development on public lands and could override the moratorium. 
 While estimates of how long the gas along the Front would supply the country vary, some in favor of drilling say it does not matter. ''They claim it's only four or five days of gas for the U.S.,'' said Arnie Gettel, a Teton County commissioner who supports the drilling. ''But that could mean 15 years of production for us here.''
 While standoffs between environmentalists and developers are frequent in the West, this one is different. First, many of those against development in this rock-rib conservative region are Republicans who are angry that, in their view, the Bush administration holds nothing sacred when it comes to the environment. Mr. Burk is one of them.
 Second, these battles no longer occur along the same ideological lines they once did. As much of the country has been developed, the lure of the wild has created an economy all its own. These debates are increasingly a clash of two opposing economies: one based on protecting natural resources for the so-called new economy of hunting, recreation and tourism, the other based on consuming them. 
 ''Most of this new economy is amenity driven,'' said Larry Swanson, a Ph.D. economist with the O'Connor Center for the Rocky Mountain West, a research organization in Missoula, Mont., that has studied the emerging economy. ''People want to live near mountains and rivers.''
 This new economy is the future of Montana, Dr. Swanson said. ''Natural resources accounts for a declining share of the state's economy,'' he said. ''Eighty to 90 percent of the growth is in urban areas'' with access to wild lands for recreation.
 That pattern appears to be playing out in Choteau, though more slowly than in other places. Many people have built second homes at the foot of the mountains, including the television talk show host David Letterman, and many more pass through on their way to Glacier National Park. That, some say, is the future. 
 ''Farming and ranching has tanked as far as job creation,'' said Mary Sexton, a Teton County commissioner, rancher and part owner of the Stage Stop Inn, a new motel. ''Most of the downtown businesses tell you that without tourism they'd dry up and blow away.''
 Mr. Gettel argues that the decline in prices for livestock and farm products is precisely why drilling should be permitted, to revive the economy. ''Prices are not good,'' he said. ''It may not be too much longer and my boys won't be farming.'' 
 Some argue that living in such a rugged, undeveloped area is part of a heritage that should be preserved. ''There is a sense of place on the Front,'' Ms. Flora said. ''People have an attachment to the landscape, from the sacred sites of the Blackfeet to the third-generation elk hunter who wants his son to hunt here.''
 Still, local sentiment over whether to drill is evenly split, according to a recent poll. The issue is so touchy, said Melody Martinsen, editor of The Choteau Acantha, a weekly newspaper, that ''we're probably the only paper in the country that hasn't written an editorial about it.'' 
 That is because Ms. Martinsen and her husband, Jeff, are two of the three members of the newspaper's editorial board. While Mr. Martinsen favors development, she is opposed. 
 ''It can be done in an environmentally sound manner,'' Mr. Martinsen said. ''The technology is there to do it.'' 
 Ms. Martinsen gently disagrees with her husband. ''It's a handful of jobs over a handful of years,'' she said. The Front ''should be down on the list of places we get our natural gas from.'' 
 Mr. Burk, the lawyer, takes it further. ''There's lots of people like me who have never thought of civil disobedience,'' he said. ''But I am now. And there are other current and former Republicans who are talking about stopping the rape of our last wild places.''

HEADLINE: At Rally in Vital State, Bush Attacks Kerry on Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Abby Goodnough contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., March 20 

 BODY:
President Bush on Saturday came to the state that delivered him the White House in 2000 for his first full-scale campaign rally of 2004 and opened a new line of attack on Senator John Kerry, saying his Democratic rival would raise taxes and choke off the economic recovery.
 Before thousands of enthusiastic supporters in a city that could determine whether he can keep Florida in his column this time around, Mr. Bush said Mr. Kerry had voted 350 times to raise taxes in his nearly two decades in the Senate and was now setting out plans that would inevitably mean higher taxes. 
 Clearly pumped up by the reception he received and obviously relishing being in the thick of the political give-and-take, Mr. Bush ticked off popular components of the tax cuts he has signed into law, including an increase in the child credit, a tax break for many married couples, an expansion of the lowest tax bracket and a cut in the tax on dividends.
 Mr. Kerry, he said, opposed them all. ''He also supported a 50-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline,'' Mr. Bush added, referring to a proposed increase in the federal gasoline tax that Mr. Kerry backed in 1994. ''He wanted you to pay all that money at the pump, and wouldn't even throw in a free car wash.''
 Mr. Bush said the combination of Mr. Kerry's spending proposals and his support of budget deficit reduction could lead to only one outcome.
 ''Given Senator Kerry's record of supporting tax increases, it's pretty clear how he's going to fill the tax gap,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He's going to tax all of you. Fortunately, you're not going to give him that chance. Higher taxes right now would undermine growth and destroy jobs just as our economy is getting stronger.''
 Mr. Kerry voted against the two big tax cuts Mr. Bush pushed through Congress, in 2001 and 2003, which between them contained all the provisions that the president said Mr. Kerry opposed.
 Mr. Kerry has said that as president he would support repealing Mr. Bush's tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000 a year. But he has indicated that he would vote to extend a variety of tax reductions that are scheduled to expire at the end of this year, like the latest increase in the child credit, the break for married couples and the expansion of the 10 percent income bracket.
 In 1993, Mr. Kerry voted for President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction package, which as Mr. Bush noted on Saturday amounted to the largest tax increase in American history. The package also succeeded in the view of many economists in helping to bring down the deficit, which Democrats say paved the way for the economic boom of the 1990's.
 In a statement, Mr. Kerry said Mr. Bush had failed to address the loss of jobs during his administration and what Democrats say is a growing economic burden on the middle class.
 ''I agree with him,'' Mr. Kerry said, ''there is a choice between two economic visions: the vision of the 1990's that created 23 million jobs, a record surplus and a balanced budget, and the vision that he has stubbornly pursued that has cost more than 3 million jobs, created record deficits and undermined our future economic strength and prosperity.''
 In discussing his own economic record, Mr. Bush said the tax cuts were working and that job growth was gaining strength. After shedding jobs for most of his term, the economy began creating jobs again last fall, but the pace of employment growth slowed again this winter.
 Mr. Bush got an almost rapturous welcome here after being introduced by his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, and Laura Bush. Standing with a sign behind him proclaiming America to be ''Safer, Stronger, Better,'' Mr. Bush said there was an election coming up, and ''I thought I'd come down for a little spring training.''
 But there was nothing unpracticed or tentative in his assault on Mr. Kerry. His tone was relaxed, and often more mocking than biting. And his introduction to his stump speech of an extended critique of Mr. Kerry's record on taxes reflected his campaign's detailed plan to proceed methodically through Mr. Kerry's legislative history and public statements in an effort to define him for voters on the White House's terms.
 Mr. Bush invoked the 9/11 terrorist attacks as the defining event of his presidency and sought to contrast his record on national security with that of Mr. Kerry. His opponent, Mr. Bush suggested, was playing for the votes of foreign leaders and was too willing to view the battle against terrorism as a matter of law enforcement and intelligence gathering.
 As it was in 2000, when it ultimately went to Mr. Bush by 537 votes, Florida, along with Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and a handful of other states, will be a critical battleground this year. On Saturday, the president had his sights set particularly on the Interstate 4 corridor, which runs diagonally from Daytona Beach through Orlando to Tampa. It is home to one of the largest concentrations of swing voters in the state.
 In 2000, Al Gore won Orange County, which includes Orlando, making him the first Democrat in decades to capture the area in a presidential race. Republicans here said one reason Mr. Gore won the county was a disappointing turnout by Republican and Republican-leaning voters.
 ''For the president to win Florida, he has to win the I-4 corridor,'' said Mel Martinez, the former housing secretary who is running for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate seat now held by Bob Graham, a Democrat who is retiring. ''The president needs to win Orange County.''
 Mr. Martinez, of Orlando, said that in 2000, ''our voters didn't turn out as passionately and strongly as the other guy's did,'' a problem he said the party was addressing with an aggressive get-out-the-vote effort.
 So important is Florida that there is considerable speculation that Mr. Kerry might pick either Mr. Graham or the state's other Democratic senator, Bill Nelson, as his running mate.

HEADLINE: When Spin Spins Out of Control

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE facts, in the capital, are never just the facts.
 Last week, an obscure government actuary named Richard S. Foster rocked Washington with accusations that the Bush administration had muzzled his economic forecasts for overhauling Medicare. Mr. Foster calculated that it would cost more than $500 billion to provide a prescription drug benefit over the next 10 years, but says his boss threatened to fire him if he shared the information with Congress. Lawmakers passed the bill relying on a much lower -- and politically palatable -- figure of $400 billion. 
 The health and human services secretary, Tommy G. Thompson, immediately ordered an internal investigation, while Mr. Foster's boss, who has since left government to become a health industry lobbyist, denied making any threats. But Democrats wasted no time in charging that the White House had tampered with the truth.
 The Foster case was only the latest in a string of high-profile controversies over how the Bush White House handles information, from scientific data to health facts to intelligence in the war in Iraq. 
 In recent weeks, Environmental Protection Agency employees have said they were told to forgo the customary scientific and economic studies in developing a rule on mercury emissions. Nobel laureates issued a statement asserting the administration had distorted scientific fact on the environment, health, biomedical research and nuclear weaponry. Mr. Thompson acknowledged his agency had altered a report on racial disparities in health to sound more positive. And the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a nonpartisan research institution, found that administration officials ''systematically misrepresented'' the threat from Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs.
 ''This is not an administration that believes the truth will set you free,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, echoing the sentiments of others in his party. Mr. Emanuel, who served as a top adviser to President Bill Clinton before running for elective office, went on to offer his own coda for life in Washington: ''You can spin, but you can't deceive.''
 But the line between spin and deception is a thin one indeed, as Mr. Clinton (''I did not have sex with that woman'') amply demonstrated. And as the Medicare controversy unfolded last week, Republicans noted pointedly that President Bush won election by vowing to restore integrity to the White House, a goal they say he has more than achieved.
 ''President Bush is about one of the most straightforward, straight-shooting executives we have seen, particularly in comparison to his predecessor,'' said Senator George Allen of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He added, ''This is just purely political gamesmanship on the part of Democrats.''
 The truth is that every president, Democrat and Republican, spins the facts to put his policies in the best possible light, and many have withheld information when it suited their needs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, fearing a backlash from isolationists, secretly helped the British before the attack on Pearl Harbor. John Kennedy dissembled about his medical condition. Lyndon Johnson exaggerated the progress of the Vietnam War. Richard Nixon lost his presidency over a cover-up. 
 So the question is not whether the Bush administration has shaded the facts, but whether in doing so, it has approached a tipping point, beyond which even its Republican allies in Congress no longer trust what it says. 
 ''I think the White House has come under such disrepute over the years that whether we have approached what would be the tipping point is hard to say,'' said James MacGregor Burns, a presidential historian at the University of Richmond, who studies leadership. ''A lot of the cynicism among the public results from failures on the part of not only this president, but also earlier presidents, in putting out full and accurate information.''
 With its agencies and research institutions churning out analyses, Washington is awash in facts and figures. Alice Rivlin, who has served Democratic presidents from Johnson to Clinton, said Americans have been ''very lucky as a nation'' to have career bureaucrats dedicated to producing accurate information. ''What has characterized our government, over all the time I've been in it, is that the numbers are honest,'' she said.
 HOW politicians use those numbers is another story. As President Clinton's budget director, Ms. Rivlin said, she thought the administration's estimates of the cost of its health care plan were too low. ''I had to defend numbers that I thought were optimistic,'' she said. 
 That is a conundrum political appointees often face. In 1981, David A. Stockman, who ran the Office of Management and Budget under President Reagan, nearly lost his job after he confessed to a magazine reporter that upon discovering that the White House could not simultaneously reduce taxes, increase military spending and cut the deficit, he altered his computer models to suggest that it could.
 ''This thing pales in comparison to what David Stockman did,'' said Lou Cannon, a biographer of President Reagan, referring to the Medicare controversy. Of the Bush administration, he said, ''If you invented some deceptiveness scale, I don't think this administration stands out. ''
 Others, though, say the Bush administration bends the facts more than most. 
 ''I think the Bush administration, for various reasons, seems to have a higher ratio of statistical prevarication than most,'' said Kevin Phillips, the author of ''American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush,'' a book that is highly critical of the president.
 One reason may be the ballooning deficit, which Mr. Phillips said is forcing the White House to put a positive spin on its economic numbers -- especially in an election year. The deficit was clearly an issue with the Medicare bill. With conservative Republicans balking at the $400 billion cost, it might have been defeated, or significantly altered, had Mr. Foster's estimates been widely known. 
 While Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to evoke memories of Watergate (''What did the president know; when did he know it?'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts asked last week about the Medicare numbers), Mr. Cannon, the Reagan biographer, says it is difficult to imagine the president paying attention to the work of a lowly actuary. Questions about Mr. Bush's credibility, he said, will ultimately be decided on the far bigger issue of how the administration handled intelligence information leading up to the Iraq war.
 Mr. Burns, the presidential historian, agrees. ''If you make a mistake or a misstatement about domestic policy, you can retrieve it, but if you make a mistake in military policy of the sort that involves bad information, there may be no remedy,'' he said. ''That, it seems to me, is the tipping point.''


CORRECTION-DATE: April 11, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 21 about how the White House handles information and pointing out the thin line between spin and deception misquoted former President Bill Clinton. Early in 1998, referring to Monica Lewinsky, he said, ''I did not have sexual relations with that woman,'' not ''I did not have sex with that woman.''

AS Dessie Curley (Colm Meaney) says in THE SNAPPER (1993), ''Times have changed.'' So when his unmarried 20-year-old daughter, Sharon (Tina Kellegher), announces that she's pregnant, he's not happy, but he doesn't much care what the neighbors think. The real question is who the baby's father is, and sharon's not talking. (When the truth comes out, it's clear why.) Yes, all the curleys' Irish working-class peers gossip, but Sharon keeps going to the pub with her dentally disadvantaged girlfriends and happily sings ''Papa, Don't Preach,'' Madonna's tribute to single motherhood, with the karaoke machine. It's a truly happy comic drama, directed by Stephen Frears - Wednesday at 8:55 a.m. and 7:25 p.m. on Sundance. 
 ''Only when we have to fight to stay human do we realize how precious it is to us, how dear,'' Kevin McCarthy tells Dana Wynter in Don Sielgel's original INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956). You don't hear that sort of thing in science fiction movies these days. But this film has always been in a class by itself, based on a Collier's magazine serial by Jack Finney about a small California town where people begin behaving unlike themselves. It turns out that while they sleep they're being replaced by strange pods from outer space. The pod people have no emotions, cannot feel pain and have no need for love. The film is a thrillingly creepy celebration of paranoia, and the finish (one simple sentence about a traffic accident) is quietly fabulous - Wednesday at 11 p.m. on Sci Fi.
 Ever wonder what all the fuss over Jean Harlow, the original 30's platinum blonde, was about? Victor Fleming's saucy pre-Code farce BOMBSHELL (1933) will explain. Ms. Harlow, who was 22 and had already appeared in more than two dozen films, plays Lola Burns, a glamorous Hollywood star who never leaves her Beverly Hills mansion without her Old English sheepdogs and a couple of servants. Lee Tracy plays the bane of her existence, Space Hanlon, the studio publicist, who will do anything to get Lola's name into the papers. He breaks up her romances, sabotages her attempt to adopt a baby by horrifying the orphanage committee and, when she just wants to escape, he tracks her down at a fancy desert hotel. He ven hires fake stalkers - Friday at 10 a.m. on TCM.
 We know the cast of THE FULL MONTY (1997) much better now than when this charming one-of-a-kind comedy, directed by Peter Cattaneo, was first released. Tom Wilkinson has starred in ''In the Bedroom,'' Robert Carlyle did ''Angela's Ashes'' and Mark Addy played Fred Flintstone. Here they play unemployed British steelworkers so desperate for money that they become male strippers. And although most of them do not, to put it kindly, have gym-perfect bodies, they decide to bare all - Thursday at 8 p.m. and Friday at 4 p.m. on VH1.
 A lot of Federico Fellini's boyhood memoir AMARCORD (1973) is dreamlike, but the most magical scene is the sighting of the ocean liner Rex passing a small Italian village on its maiden voyage. The townspeople come out in rowboats to geta closer look. This exhilarating, bittersweet drama, which won the Oscar for best foreign-language film, traces a year in the life of that village. The ensemble cast includes Bruno Zanin as the teenager Titta, and Armando Brancia and Pupella Maggio as his parents. Their universe includes teachers, lawyers, Fascists, hairdressers, prostitutes and, this being Fellini, a midget nun - Monday at 9:45 a.m. and 4 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 a.m. on IFC.

SONGS OF the GORILLA NATION
My Journey Through Autism.
By Dawn Prince-Hughes.
225 pp. New York:
Harmony Books. $24.
 THE great New Zealand novelist Janet Frame, who was spared the lobotomist's knife when a hospital official read that she had won a literary prize, resented the decision by a panel of psychiatrists that she did not have schizophrenia after all. The tag, she wrote, ''had been the answer to all my misgivings about myself,'' and without it she had nothing but the ''homelessness of self.''
 Dawn Prince-Hughes knows only too well the harsh burden of suffering without taxonomy, of feeling that you don't fit your fate and you don't know why or who or what gnostic Merck Manual might define your despair. As she explains in this unsettling, lyrical, sometimes self-pitying but ultimately redemptive memoir, Prince-Hughes did not receive a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome, a form of high-functioning autism, until she was 36; the fact that she survived through decades spent ''alienated, different, disconnected and hurting,'' the pain made more malignly intimate because its cause was unknown, strikes her as ''no minor miracle.'' In addition to her Framean sense of psychic homelessness, Prince-Hughes endured years of being ''technically homeless,'' living on the streets, sleeping in a church stairwell, eating out of garbage cans, consuming whatever alcohol and drugs came her way. Sometimes friends or acquaintances would take pity on her and invite her to stay with them. Eventually her ''odd habits and chronic lack of resources,'' her difficulty with social lubricants like simple banter or looking+people in the eye, would make them uncomfortable, and they'd ask her to leave. 
 The individuals who proved her true and resilient salvation, who allowed her to settle quietly into the berth of herself and from there extend synaptic lifelines of love and work to the world outside, were not Homo sapiens at all, but a group of our larger, shaggier ape kin, the gorillas. ''Songs of the Gorilla Nation'' is as much a rhapsody to gorillas as it is an anatomy of autism. It was through getting to know the gorillas at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle as an adult that Prince-Hughes began to feel, for the first time, connected, safe, understood. A gorilla could gaze at her, or touch her, or grunt at her, and she would feel serenely joyful. She describes the moment a massive silverback male named Congo accidentally brushed his fingers against hers, and then kept them there for ''what seemed like a long time,'' in religious-ecstatic terms, Hildegard of Bingen by way of ''Jane Eyre'': ''This is what it is, I thought. This is what it means to love and be loved'' and ''to not be alone in the vastness of the space we hurtle through.''
 Her experiences resonate with what I have heard from field biologists who have studied the apes. Chimpanzees may be our closest living relatives, having diverged from Homo sapiens about five million years ago, but they can be hot-tempered, argumentative, sometimes violent. Gorillas, which diverged from the line that gave rise to humans and chimpanzees perhaps seven million years ago, are surprisingly gentle and low-key, and when they accept you into their fold, one researcher told me, ''you feel honored, even blessed.'' Dian Fossey, another woman who had difficulty adjusting to social norms, found a haven among mountain gorillas. But whereas Fossey's love for the gorillas seemed to heighten her misanthropy, Prince-Hughes parlayed her trans-genus bond into an earnest, if hesitant, appreciation for her own kind, and a desire for their acceptance and admiration. She began studying the gorillas, taking such impressively detailed notes on their behavior that she attracted the attention of the zoo's director of research. And thus a woman who had dropped out of high school began a methodical course of research that eventually earned her a doctorate in anthropology. 
 Less formally if no less zealously, she studied how to get along with people, comparing herself to Seven of Nine in ''Star Trek: Voyager'': a woman who had been raised by the ruthlessly robotic-communistic Borg, and who on re-entering Star Fleet society in adulthood had to learn the rites, the rituals, the chitchat cassettes of ordinary human relationships. 
 Prince-Hughes also began exploring her own nature. She learned that a young relative had Asperger's, and when she saw his behavior, she saw herself. ''He grimaced and held his body in strange postures, spoke to people in ways that were blunt and considered rude,'' she writes, ''and displayed nervous tics when his many anxieties and sensitivities were brought close to the surface.'' Watching him was painful and enraging, she says, like looking in a mirror and hating the view. Yet she knew that autistic traits often run in families, and his diagnosis inspired her to consult a doctor, who confirmed that she, too, had the syndrome. ''I felt an immense wave of relief wash over me as everything suddenly made sense,'' she says. ''Like someone making amends in a 12-step program, I almost felt compelled to contact everyone who had ever been impacted by my autism -- whether positively or negatively -- and explain.''
 Autism is widely discussed these days. Much evidence suggests that the condition is on the rise, and nobody knows why or what to do about it. Asperger's has attracted particular interest because of its association with so-called geek culture: people with Asperger's are often highly intelligent, and they may focus intently, even obsessively, on one or a handful of subjects to the exclusion of everything else. This may sound like a useful attribute in a keyboard-driven economy, but Prince-Hughes does an excellent job of puncturing that idle thought balloon. Yes, she is extremely bright, and able to fixate on a subject with admirable concentration. But mostly what she conveys in her autobiography is naked desperation -- to calm down and loosen up, not to see a break in a routine as the beginning of the apocalypse, to trust that the lover who is angry at you now will not be angry at you forever. 
 In time, Prince-Hughes found somebody to love and trust, a woman named Tara, with whom she now has a son. She became comfortable enough in the world to get a job as an adjunct professor of anthropology. Yet she still has to monitor others and herself, to count the number of seconds she looks in somebody's eyes before looking away. And she admits that she will never understand certain forms of human entertainment -- clowns, for example. ''It is hard to express the horror I feel when I am out at a parade or carnival,'' she says, ''and I see a clown coming.'' Now that is a sign of real mental health.

HEADLINE: Cover Baby's Ears: Mommy's Online

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
ONE day last month a woman identifying herself as the wife of a Manhattan banker posted a message at the Web site UrbanBaby.com expressing concern that her husband was disappearing at regular intervals each week. Though he said he was out with clients, the woman worried that he might, in fact, be busy procuring services rather than providing them.
 Such is the spirit of shared purpose among users of UrbanBaby, a resource guide and online community devoted to the concerns of cosmopolitan mothers, that other members were soon offering to send her the names of private investigators near Wall Street. The banker's wife wondered if there were brothels near her husband's place of business. Most certainly, another woman answered: ''There are many 'houses' right in the financial district.'' Like all the participants in UrbanBaby's round-the-clock online conversations, the woman with such knowledge was anonymous, though she described herself as a former call girl. 
 UrbanBaby began quietly in New York five years ago as a reference bank for parents seeking information on pediatricians, child care, baby gear and other necessities. Championed as an invaluable resource, it has also emerged as the city's most compelling window into the miseries, joys, obsessions and paranoias of modern family life. Drawing from a range of parents (almost all mothers) in varied economic and occupational circumstances, UrbanBaby has become a forum where women hold up the weighted personal choices they make -- to work or to stay home, to live on more or less, to raise children with backyards or without -- to a chorus eager both to validate and to reprove. Through its evolution, UrbanBaby, or UB, as its users refer to it, has offered bottomless wells of support for the weary and confused, but powerful evidence, too, against theories that nature has fashioned women into the species' consensus-builders.
 In any given hour, a query about colic, gastric tube defect, Pedialyte, flying with an infant, a sullen husband or a certain play group in Brooklyn Heights will be met almost immediately by a string of helpful answers from other mothers. Users of the site credit it with helping them through ailing marriages, illness and all manner of adversity. ''I work, and I don't have a lot of access to mommy information,'' said Betsy Gleick, an assistant managing editor at People Magazine, ''so this is my equivalent of the park bench.'' But because a request often seeks to justify one approach to child care or lifestyle over another, it can set off a fierce debate about subjects including, but not limited to, subsidies for child care, the merits of chicken nuggets, the morality of $700 Bugaboo strollers, the cost of living in New York, the price of houses in Montclair, N.J., the political correctness of processed cheese, John Kerry, gay marriage and American involvement in Saudi Arabia.
 Founded by Susan Maloney and her husband, John, Brooklyn parents of children age 3 and 7, UrbanBaby has created online communities in six other cities -- Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Seattle and Austin, Tex. But the New York site remains the most populated, active and vibrantly argumentative, with 7,000 to 8,000 postings a day on its message boards, many straining the ropes of civility.
 Among long-term devotees of UB in New York, a handful of arguments have achieved a kind of mythic status, among them the laundry fight, which resurfaces regularly. It began when a woman asked what others thought about leaving a baby asleep in a locked apartment for a few minutes while Mother went down to the basement to pop a few things in the washing machine. Some found the idea horrifyingly insupportable. (''What if you fall down and break your leg?'' one wrote. ''Or the apartment starts on fire? It isn't smart.'') Others said the scenario was no different from what happens when a mother in Westchester ventures from one floor of her house to another while her child is napping.
 What really seemed at issue was whether one sort of living arrangement (suburban) was more virtuous than an alternative (urban). ''When you leave your apartment, you're no longer in your home,'' wrote a participant. ''When you live in a house and go downstairs to do laundry, you're still in your house. DUH!'' This incited a defense of the idea of an apartment as a home, beginning with, ''You're only making yourself sound more and more stupid.''
 Melissa Senate, an avid user of UB who thanks the community in the acknowledgments of her coming book, ''Whose Wedding Is It Anyway?'' said she had to walk away from her computer screen during the laundry exchange. ''It got so heated and angry and ugly,'' she recalled. But still, the tone of the board makes sense to Ms. Senate, who lives in Manhattan with her husband and 20-month-old son.
 ''Being a mother can be so frustrating,'' she said. ''Mothers get picked on -- people on the street will look at you and tell you your baby should be wearing socks.'' UrbanBaby, she said, is ''the one place where you can vent your anger in a way that you can't vent at your toddler or husband or mother-in-law.''
 As with many message boards, the shield of anonymity makes a certain amount of hostility possible. ''Most of our audience has never used message boards before,'' Mr. Maloney explained. ''The person who comes here is not the type of person who started a Well account at the age of 19.'' Mr. Maloney said that he and his wife believed strongly that anonymity would keep the conversations more free-flowing.
 Certainly inhibition is hard to discern. One afternoon Amy Stevenson, a 37-year-old mother in Park Slope, Brooklyn, sparked fireworks by wondering online whether she had been overprotective in not leaving her 6-month-old alone with a baby sitter. This prompted a proclamation from a message-poster who said she had gone out every Friday and Saturday night since her child was 2 weeks old. ''Who even knew if it was true?'' Ms. Stevenson said. ''But it really got things going. People really know how to push each other's buttons.''
 ''As a parent, there are so many important choices you make,'' she said. ''All these debates are raging on internally, and all the demons you're working out in your head are played out here to the nth degree.''
 Few topics at the site ignite passions quite like the mention of money, which in New York, especially, seems tightly linked to the imperatives of sound child-rearing. If you don't have a 2-year-old, then you might be forgiven for not knowing just how controversial a $700 apparatus known as the Bugaboo stroller can be. Generally speaking, to those who don't want or can't afford them, the strollers are symbolic of a constellation of excesses that taint the culture of child-rearing in New York.
 Last week one mother posted a query about starting a play group on the Upper East Side, for people who were not the following: ''Bugaboo owners, people who judge and compare babies, spend more than $200 on outfits for son or daughter, worry about preschool before their son or daughter is 1 and cannot laugh at themselves. Easygoing parents a must.'' The woman was accused of being ''juvenile'' for judging people by their stroller choices. Typically on UB, detractors of the Bugaboo are deemed ''bitter'' and ''jealous.''
 Those are also the words sometimes hurled by SAHM's -- stay-at-home moms in UB parlance, particularly those with full-time help -- at those who label them lazy. ''Trust fund parents'' don't engender too much good will either. ''How nice that you have a trust fund,'' one correspondent wrote another last week. ''The only judgment of you that I can make from your post is that you don't know how to spell 'judgment.' '' The original writer (who had added a superfluous ''e'' to the word) had announced that she was a stay-at-home mom who made more money than her husband because of her family earnings.
 It is a curious feature of UB that in an atmosphere with a constant undercurrent of class antagonism, participants feel regularly compelled to divulge their assets and earnings. One afternoon last week a woman sent a query about whether she was doing decently on a salary of $100,000 a year, with two children and a one-bedroom apartment. Last month, another wrote in to say that her family's income of $350,000 a year made it the poorest in her private preschool. The month of December provided frenzied speculation about Wall Street bonuses among many women who work in finance and wives of investment bankers who asked what they could all expect.
 ''It's really funny, because it allows me to really see into the economy and where the bonuses are going,'' said Raquel Palmer, a principle in private equity at KPS Special Situations Funds in New York. A mother of two, she was drawn into UB after a single visit when she read a posting about a woman trying to seduce her doorman. ''A lot of the people on the site will consider themselves middle class, and they're getting $200,000 bonuses,'' she said.
 UrbanBaby's generally affluent audience has made it attractive to advertisers who provide the revenue that makes UB profitable, Mr. Maloney said. UB is free to users, and registration is not required for the message boards, though it is required for the myriad other services UB provides, including a daily e-mail newsletter. UB also organizes movie outings at Loews theaters that mothers can attend with their children. 
 But it seems to be the sustenance of community -- whether comforting or confrontational -- that is addictive. Many women speak of logging on only when their husbands won't notice. Referring respectively to her online habits and to her ''darling husband,'' one user wrote, ''I feel like my alcoholic mom, too, the way I try to hide it from DH.'' 
 Of course the ethics of hiding indulgences from one's husband is a subject ripe for dissection on the UB boards. Presumably, opinions would be divided.

HEADLINE: After the Sticker Shock: What People Pay for Drugs

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
Prescription drug costs are a hot topic these days, what with the White House ruckus over the price of the Medicare bill and the commotion about going to Canada for lower prices. But forget, for now, the high sticker prices and look at what many people actually pay: the co-payment. 
 For generic drugs, to judge by a Segal Company survey of costs for state employees, the payment fluctuates little across the nation -- usually $7 to $8. But venture into brands, and wider disparities appear. When there are just two choices -- branded or not -- state employees in the Midwest pay almost twice the rate in the Northeast. The highest prices crop up in three-tier plans, which include generic drugs, drugs on an approved list and other branded drugs. The Northeast is generally spared such plans, though, while they are fairly common else-where. HUBERT B. HERRING

SOME fund managers advise shareholders to invest for the long term while they churn their own portfolios and dream of the next initial public offering they can flip. But for the guardians of a college endowment that is nearly 700 years old, long term really means long.
 The investment committee at Clare College at the University of Cambridge ignores twists and turns in the markets, meeting only once or twice a year to decide how to allocate assets in the $:50 million ($91.6 million) fund. Some holdings, including parcels of commercial property, have been in the portfolio for several years. When it comes to the stock market, the decision-making essentially involves a simple yes or no on where -- or whether -- to be invested. The advisers do not pick individual stocks, preferring to invest through index funds, and they concentrate on a few large global markets, avoiding regions that seem overpriced. 
 During the bear market, the laid-back approach produced steadier returns than those of mutual funds with aggressive management styles. The fund does not disclose its performance figures regularly, but Donald Hearn, Clare's bursar, estimates that the portfolio's value fell by a cumulative 7 percent in the three years through September, a period in which major stock indexes in the United States and Britain generally lost one-fourth to one-third of their values -- in some cases, much more. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for example, dropped by more than 30 percent during this period.
 In the 12 months through September, the fund was up 9.3 percent, a return that Mr. Hearn, 56, described as ''not special but quite acceptable.'' Over the same period, the Financial Times Stock Exchange All-Share index rose about 13 percent.
 In keeping with his long-term approach, he said, the fund calculates its returns only every six months and will not do so again until the end of this month. 
 The methods used by the fund's advisers, led by Andrew Smithers, an economist and consultant whom Mr. Hearn calls his ''investment guru,'' reflect their belief that after asset valuations reach extremes, they eventually revert to historical norms. They are not confident that they can forecast what markets will do tomorrow or next week, but they are convinced that they can predict their course over a matter of years. ''We take the tack that we are not good enough at stock picking or market timing to take detailed decisions like that,'' Mr. Hearn said. ''I wouldn't claim we're going to get it right every single year, but we have had a strong run for a long period.''
 The fund's advisers argue that major stock markets are severely overpriced, especially in the United States. By their calculations, fair value for the Standard & Poor's 500 is about 700, or 37 percent below its present level. As a result, the fund now owns no American stocks.
 It isn't shunning stocks entirely. They comprise 31 percent of the current portfolio; if the advisers believed that all markets were currently at fair value, a neutral allocation for the fund would be 70 percent, Mr. Hearn said, adding that he aims for an annual return of 7.5 percent, two-thirds of which is used for college programs and the rest to cover inflation.
 Three-fourths of the equity portfolio is invested in Britain, with the rest divided roughly equally among Europe, Japan and other Asian markets. 
 Real estate accounts for 28 percent of assets, slightly less than the 30 percent weighting that the managers consider neutral. About two-thirds of the property investment is in retail buildings; most of the rest is in commercial office space.
 Some 39 percent is now in short-term bonds and cash, and a 2 percent sliver is in private equity. If markets were fairly valued, the advisers said, the fund would hold only minimal amounts of bonds or cash.
 Because markets tend to reach a valuation extreme, then move to an extreme in the other direction, the S.&P. 500 ought to fall not just to 700, but through that level, said Mr. Smithers, 66, a former London investment banker who runs Smithers & Company, a consulting firm whose clients include fund managers and other professional investors.
 Mr. Smithers is an alumnus of Clare, as is Mr. Hearn, who as bursar looks after Clare's business side. The college was founded in 1326 by Lady Elizabeth de Clare, granddaughter of King Edward I. Her endowment to the college, a few years after its founding, was two English estates. Today, the endowment is one of the smallest among the 31 Cambridge colleges, as is Clare itself; it has fewer than 700 undergraduate and graduate students in a variety of fields. Each college has its own endowment, managed in its own, idiosyncratic fashion, and the university has a separate one to pay for a variety of activities.
 Mr. Smithers bases his forecasts, in part, on Tobin's Q, a measure devised by James Tobin, a Nobel laureate in economics, that compares a market's valuation with the estimated cost of rebuilding the component businesses from scratch. Mr. Smithers said that other tools also show stocks to be overvalued.
 The portfolio's light weighting in stocks means that the endowment missed much of the recovery last year from the bear market. It also missed much of the bear market.
 The managers sold off shares in September 1999, including all of their American holdings, a move that they conceded owed much to luck. They had regarded stocks as overvalued for some time, but because the fund's custom is to move deliberately before allocation shifts, it profited from the equity bubble until it was advanced; stocks sold off violently six months later.
 Tobin's Q is conceptually simple: It holds that the stock market is worth the replacement cost of its constituent companies and that investors should buy only when the price is considerably less. But the measure has critics.
 ''Tobin's Q is a blunt indicator which assumes you can accurately calculate the cost of replacing your assets,'' said Tom Elliott, a strategist in London for J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management. ''That might be feasible for the manufacturing sector, but it gets progressively more difficult for services, where intangibles become relatively more important. So we wouldn't pay too much attention to it as a valuation measure.''
 Mr. Elliott said that a very long-term approach forced investors to miss out on highly profitable market moves, like the rally in stocks last year, and that there were too many variables to make accurate forecasts much more than six or nine months ahead. ''Forecasting further out means accepting greater degrees of risk to the underlying assumptions,'' he said. ''Eventually, you are into futurology, and you've left macroeconomics behind.''
 Mr. Smithers has no compunction about that. Economic forecasting and the impact of economic factors on the markets must involve guesswork, something he would prefer to avoid.
 He finds few investments today that he can endorse wholeheartedly. He is shunning stocks, but also long-term bonds. He said that over many decades, bonds have returned 4 percent more than the rate of inflation. With 10-year bonds yielding about 4 percent, investors would require an economy with zero inflation for a decade to receive only an average return.
 ''Bonds look to me to be as dangerous as equities,'' he said. ''I think bonds are another accident waiting to happen.''
 Mr. Smithers also disdains hot alternatives like long-short hedge funds, which try to profit from buying some stocks and selling short an equivalent amount in others. He called them ''an expensive way to hold cash'' because when all such funds are taken in aggregate, their holdings should cancel one another out.
 MR. SMITHERS offered many views on economics and investing that are at odds with conventional wisdom. For instance, he dismisses the notion that greater productivity is good for share prices. A more productive economy grows faster and enriches workers and consumers, but not necessarily shareholders, he argued.
 ''There is no rational model that says this makes any difference,'' he said. ''If you have a more productive economy, the gains are competed away in higher wages and lower prices.''
 The belief that higher productivity bolsters share valuations is ''the sort of thing you get stockbrokers saying when they can't think of anything else to say,'' Mr. Smithers contended. ''You wouldn't hear an economist say that.''
 Then he named one economist who has said it. ''Alan Greenspan banged on about productivity gains as if they meant better markets when they don't,'' he said. ''Not only should central bankers avoid asset bubbles, but they shouldn't be cheerleaders.''
 Mr. Smithers is anything but that. One of the biggest mistakes investors make, he said, is failing to accept that there are often no good investments available.
 ''The problem for investors is they don't have the sort of patience that taking a rational view requires,'' he said. ''I know of no information that would allow investors to make a rational decision to buy shares in any market at the moment. A lot of time people lose money; a lot of time they make it. The tragedy for most investors is they want to make money all the time.''

HEADLINE: Some Dot-Coms Are Alive, and Even Expanding

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
ROBERT LOCASCIO and Tim Bixby are running a growing business. They are hiring people and the 7,000 square feet they have in a Garment Center building is getting too tight. So they are looking for 10,000 to 12,000 square feet, preferably in the same neighborhood, where the rents are lower than in Midtown.
 Their company, LivePerson, is an Internet-based services operation, the kind of high-technology company that fell under the rubric ''dot-com'' a few years ago. Many of the dot-coms that blazed so brightly in the late 1990's are gone now, of course, having failed after venture capital financing dried up in early 2000.
 But there are increasing indications that the technology companies that survived the implosion are prospering -- and increasing their need for office space. 
 ''We are seeing the re-emergence of the dot-com companies that were able to survive the blood bath and strengthen their balance sheets,'' said Kenneth M. Krasnow, a senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company.
 According to figures compiled by the company, of the top 50 Manhattan leasing transactions in 2002, none involved Internet or computer industry companies. Last year, there were three: I.B.M.'s renewal of 159,000 square feet at 590 Madison Avenue, the Donovan Data Systems renewal of 115,000 square feet at 115 West 18th Street and Microsoft's sublease of 100,000 square feet at 1290 Avenue of the Americas.
 So far this year there have been two high-tech deals, totaling 64,000 square feet, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
 One of those involved Google, which operates the popular search engine and has greatly expanded its New York operations in the last few years, going from 23,000 square feet to more than 100,000 square feet at 1440 Broadway at 40th Street.
 Travelocity, the travel reservations company, has gone from 5,000 square feet to 20,000 square feet in a building at 139 Centre Street, Mr. Krasnow said. Yahoo, another Internet-based company, has outgrown 45,000 square feet of space at 111 West 40th Street, he added, and is in negotiations for 70,000 square feet farther south, at 620 Avenue of the Americas at 18th Street.
 Even DoubleClick, an Internet advertising and marketing company that radically downsized after the crash, is seeking to expand again, Mr. Krasnow said. The company once had 400,000 square feet of space in a building at 450 West 33rd Street at 10th Avenue. Subsequently, it moved into 75,000 square feet of space in the old Port Authority distribution center at 111 Eighth Avenue.
 Paul Pariser, one of the founders of Taconic Investment Partners, which partially owns and manages the Eighth Avenue building, said he was initially leery about leasing space to an Internet-based company. But he said he found that far from being a start-up burning its way through venture capital, DoubleClick was ''a real business with real earnings that is well capitalized.''
 Brokers said the company was seeking another 30,000 to 40,000 square feet of space in the 2.3-million-square-foot building, which occupies the entire block between 15th and 16th Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Mr. Pariser said there had been discussions about expansion, although there has been no agreement as yet. ''They are growing and need more space,'' he said.
 Technology companies are also becoming more active downtown, although mostly for smaller spaces. Recently, a company named Cobite, which provides services for telecommunications companies, agreed to move from Midtown to downtown, taking 6,000 square feet at 55 Broad Street.
 The building, an old financial services structure, was refitted in the 1990's with advanced wiring and fiber-optic telecommunications lines and other equipment to attract high-technology tenants. William Rudin, president of the Rudin Management Company, said that the past few years had been difficult, but that things seem to be picking up recently.
 ''We have lost tenants,'' he said. ''Some went out of business; some retrenched. But like the rest of the economy, some of the companies are coming back and they are taking advantage of the bandwidth at 55 Broad and 110 Wall,'' which is another building owned by the Rudin family and managed by Rudin Management.
 Recent signings at 55 Broad include Pilosoft Inc., a current tenant that is increasing its space from 1,500 to 6,000 square feet; AmeriNet Communications Group, which took 1,000 square feet; and Pro4ia Inc., 1,800 square feet.
 Mr. Rudin said he was prebuilding space at 110 Wall to attract small technology companies that want to move in and set up operations immediately without waiting for the interiors to be built. He said the company is willing to lease the prebuilt spaces for as little as five years, rather than the 10 or more years most landlords want to amortize the cost of construction. ''We don't mind five-year deals because we can reuse the space,'' Mr. Rudin said. ''We feel it is a worthwhile investment for us.''
 Mr. LoCascio, chairman and chief executive of LivePerson, said he was not interested in a lease longer than three years because of the volatility of the high-tech industry. ''I want to tie real estate to the business cycle, which means two to three years,'' he said. 
 As a practical matter that usually means moving into already completed offices -- ''built-out space,'' in real estate jargon -- often space that was built for a failed dot-com. That was the case for the space that LivePerson currently occupies on the 21st floors of the building at 462 Seventh Avenue at 35th Street.
 ''The place was fully wired, and they left it as it was,'' Mr. Bixby said. ''So we moved in here with our Internet phone system and went to work.''
 Mr. LoCascio said: ''We have a strategy of spending all our money on sales and marketing and not on things like furnishings. I don't think we even bothered to paint.''
 Mr. LoCascio said he had been with the company since 1995, so he has seen both boom and bust. ''We've had quite a ride,'' he said. The company started in a 500-square-foot loft in TriBeCa, moved to 1,000 square feet in Chelsea and then on to 2,000 square feet on Broadway in SoHo and later to 40,000 square feet at 330 West 34th Street.
 Meanwhile, the company went public in April 2000, one of the last to do so before the window for high-tech initial public offerings slammed shut. ''We were one of the last to make it,'' Mr. LoCascio said. ''Of the 25 that were set to go, only 10 made it.''
 THE company's stock took a roller coaster ride as well. Starting at the initial offering price of $8 a share, the price plunged to as little as 7 cents a share before gradually recovering to the current price of about $4.50 as the company's viability became more assured. Along the way LivePerson acquired a company in Tel Aviv and shifted all its technical work to Israel, where salaries are lower than in the United States. Employment in New York dropped from 180 to 70, and the 34th Street space became a financial burden and the company moved to Seventh Avenue.
 ''It only cost them a financial pinprick to get out of there because they listened to their architect and broker and built space that could be used by any financially oriented company,'' said Alexander Chudnoff, a director at Cushman & Wakefield who has represented the company.
 It helped too that LivePerson did not try to overexpand at a time that the prevailing attitude in the industry was to grow as fast as possible to dominate markets, Mr. Chudnoff said. ''Everyone else was racing to hire people as fast as they could, so you could have been talking about hundreds of thousands of square feet, but Rob and Tim kept it under control,'' he said.
 So now, having weathered the slump, the company is planning to grow again.
 Not everyone in the high-tech industry is expanding. Some are slimming down to reduce costs for competitive reasons. Novell Inc., the developer of networking software, recently signed a lease for space on the 35th floor of the building at 1177 Avenue of the Americas at 46th Street.
 The new lease is for about 15,000 square feet, which is down from the 20,000 the company formerly had in the same location, according to one of the brokers, Martin Horner, a principal with the Staubach Company, a tenants' broker. ''They decided to do some belt-tightening and shed some space,'' Mr. Horner said. ''They are a mature technology company.''

HEADLINE: Supply Varies, Demand Doesn't

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
AS though her convoluted deal of nine years ago did not already constitute a broker's symphony -- juggling all interested parties so that three apartments on the same floor of a Park Avenue co-op building could be sold and converted into one -- Suzanne Sealy has written a coda.
 In a market of constricted inventory, Ms. Sealy of the William B. May brokerage company recently persuaded the owners of that grand 3,400-square-foot apartment to relinquish their dream home, to sell it to a new buyer and then to buy another, somewhat smaller, apartment a few blocks north on Park Avenue.
 ''I really had to scurry around to find something for them,'' she said.
 Such are the lengths to which brokers in the upscale environs of Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights go these days as listings have dwindled, bringing prices and buyer frustrations to a boil. In the other boroughs and through much of the suburban ring around New York City, however, a more balanced market equation has prevailed over the last year, with inventory warming or cooling from community to community and prices percolating upward. 
 Over all, despite some dire predictions (and certainly a temporary partial paralysis) after the Sept. 11 attacks two and a half years ago, the New York region's real estate market has continued to simmer, analysts and participants say. 
 As Jason Bram, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, put it: ''If you had told somebody at the beginning of 2001 that the regional economy would be hit by a national recession, a steep downturn in its key financial sector and the destruction of the World Trade Center, they would have found it unimaginable that the housing market would hold up this well, let alone spiral upward as it seems to be doing now. Yet that's what's happened.''
 One broad-brush indicator comes from the massive national database of sales compiled by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. According to the federal data, average home prices in New York State rose by 11.6 percent between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003 (the housing enterprise office does not provide dollar figures). New Jersey saw an even higher increase during the year, 12.1 percent. In Connecticut, the increase was 9.5 percent. All three states surpassed the national increase of 8 percent.
 ''There has been no easing at all in price patterns,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''And sustained low interest rates certainly have had the effect of increasing housing purchasing power, even if incomes are stable.''
 A stable market with healthy price increases is apparent, for instance, in the 14-county swath of northern and central New Jersey surveyed by the Otteau Appraisal Group, based in East Brunswick. As of Jan. 31, there were 18,471 properties listed throughout the 14 counties, just 43 more than the 18,428 listings at the end of January 2003. 
 Sales, too, held steady. In January of this year, taken alone, 4,795 homes were sold throughout the 14-county area, five more than the 4,790 sold in January 2003.
 Yet prices ratcheted up. In Morris County, as of March 1, the median price for all homes sold during the previous 12 months was $413,977, a 9 percent increase over the $379,935 median for homes sold during the year that ended March 1, 2003. In Sussex, the median price for the year that ended March 1 was $250,002, 16 percent higher than the $215,389 price during the previous year.
 In the confines of Manhattan, however, the squeeze was on. 
 With Wall Street's stocks and bonuses on the rebound and more and more people willing -- but often unable -- to move up, said Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, ''lack of supply is really the story of the current market.'' Mr. Miller's company prepares the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, which surveys the listings of 14 major brokerage firms from the Battery to West 116th Street and East 96th Street.
 There were 3,994 apartments listed in the area as of March 1, Mr. Miller said, a 34.5 percent drop from the 6,096 listings available on March 1, 2003. Meanwhile, the median price for all properties sold between Jan. 1 and March 1 of this year was $590,000, up 16.8 percent over the median price of $505,000 for units sold during the comparable period last year.
 Particularly striking is the fact that in the third quarter of last year, when Manhattan's median price stood at $575,000, its average price hit a record of $916,959. (The gap stems from the fact that while the median represents the precise midpoint of all sales, the average price includes all sales, with a significant number of high-end Manhattan properties skewing the average upward.)
 No doubt the average was tweaked a bit by the highest price ever paid for a Manhattan apartment: the $45 million sale last September of a 12,544-square-foot duplex penthouse with 1,960 square feet of terrace overlooking Central Park at the new Time Warner Center. And farther north than the sales included in the Elliman survey, the $1,150,000 paid recently for a renovated town house on West 137th Street in Harlem is an indication of Manhattan demand.
 ''Every listing that comes on is selling in a nanosecond,'' said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group. 
 In what seem like flashbacks to the Manhattan market frenzy of the late 90's, Ms. Corcoran said: ''Open houses are out of control. Many buildings are putting a limit on the number of people allowed in, and they are making people sign in like a doctor's office. Multiple-bid stories are too exhausting to repeat.''
 So she did: ''There is a three-bedroom postwar on East 73rd and Second Avenue. The listing came out on Tuesday morning March 2. We had nine offers the first day.''
 ''The seller instructed us to tell everyone that they needed to give their highest and best price by noon that Friday,'' Ms. Corcoran continued. ''Seven offers came in by noon that day. The other two bidders came in after the deadline, but the owners refused their bids, even though they were higher.''
 The apartment, originally listed for $1.22 million, sold for $1.4 million.

Beyond Manhattan
Healthy Markets, Skewed to Sellers
 Not quite so striking, though once again indicative of a healthy market, are the figures for other boroughs and suburbs.
 In Queens, for example, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors, which covers that borough as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties, there were 4,184 listings available at the end of January, an 8.4 percent increase from the 3,860 listings available in January 2003. And over the year the median price for a home in Queens rose 6 percent, from $313,000 in January of 2003 to $332,000 in January of this year.
 Similar trends were apparent in Nassau, where listings at the end of January stood at 3,556, a 9.7 percent increase over the 3,241 available properties in January of 2003, while the median price rose 13.1 percent to $401,500 this January, compared with $355,000 last year.
 In Suffolk, while listings slipped just a bit -- 2.3 percent -- from 5,125 in January of last year to 5,003 in January this year, the median price jumped 12.5 percent, from $278,000 to $313,000.
 ''We're approaching a more stable market,'' said Jane Salamon, president of the Long Island Board of Realtors, ''one that reflects more of a balance between buyers and sellers. It's been skewed more toward sellers.''
 Even before the traditional spring buying season, business in the region seemed hearty. ''For Sale'' signs had been planted in snow-carpeted front lawns, here and there, both in suburbanized sections of the city and surrounding counties, -- some already bearing ''Sold'' stickers.
 In Westchester, inventory has held steady, according to the county's board of realtors, with 2,026 listings at the end of last year, compared with 2,121 in December 2002. That despite rapid sales. 
 ''We're talking about a signed unconditional contract within a week,'' said Ruth Burger of the Julia B. Fee brokerage in Scarsdale. A four-bedroom colonial on 1.9 acres in the northern Westchester community of Somers, shown on a recent Sunday, immediately received several bids above its $789,000 asking price.
 The median price for Westchester homes as of Jan. 1 was $545,000, a 5 percent increase over $520,000 at the end of 2002.
 Comprehensive statistics for Connecticut are not available. But in Greenwich, Barbara Webski of the Coldwell Banker brokerage firm said: ''The upper market is coming back. We just had an accepted offer in Belle Haven for $14.9 million.'' And in Norwalk, Maggie Teed, owner of the Real Estate Marketing Group, said, ''Anything under $400,000 is gone right away.''

High-End Brooklyn
A Severe Scarcity Of Upscale Listings
 The dichotomy of high-end fever and more moderately warming market segments plays out, particularly, in Brooklyn.
 ''This year to last year, that's March 1 to March 1, we're down 36 percent in total listings,'' said Christopher Thomas, the William B. May company's vice president for Brooklyn. ''The larger the living space, the more scarce it is.''
 Mr. Thomas's company concentrates on the borough's higher-end neighborhoods, like Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Prospect Lefferts and Boerum Hill. 
 Sometimes the dearth of listings in those tonier Brooklyn districts is rooted in Manhattan. ''Several weeks ago we had a situation where a seller listed a property -- a small carriage house, private garden and parking in Brooklyn Heights -- at what all our agents felt was a very optimistic asking price, $995,000,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''He immediately had four offers, three exceeding the asking price.''
 The seller accepted an offer, then tried to complete a deal he was already negotiating for an apartment in Manhattan. ''He went back to the seller in Manhattan and discovered that there were now a half a dozen other offers, all above the asking price,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''In order to purchase that apartment, he had to exceed the above-asking price he had settled for on his carriage house.'' The man stayed put.
 For much of the rest of Brooklyn, however, the story line differs.
 Two years ago, the borough's South Shore Multiple Listing Service and Midcounty Multiple Listing Service combined to create the Brooklyn Multiple Listing Service, covering most of the borough. The new service's combined statistics indicate a substantial growth in inventory and a less drastic increase in median price.
 During the 12 months that ended March 1, said Gerard Longo, president of Madison Estates & Properties in Marine Park and a director of Brooklyn's expanded listing service, 13,700 properties came on the market, compared with 10,549 the previous year -- a 30 percent increase. Median prices during the corresponding periods rose less than 1 percent, from $456,000 to $460,000.
 ''There is more inventory out there, but demand is still vigorous, pushing up prices,'' Mr. Longo said. ''What we see is people not leaving Brooklyn, but trading up in size and staying in the borough.''

Demographics
The Dynamics Of Baby Boomers
 That urge to trade up in a recovering economy, particularly among people maturing into their full-family and peak-earning years, say real estate specialists, is largely responsible for the market squeeze in affluent communities, suburban or urban. In a kind of self-perpetuating tangle, the demand of those seeking to trade up pushes up prices so that owners who might consider selling to them end up staying put because they are not sure they can afford to trade up. And in the even more moneyed precincts of places like Manhattan, the inventory is, to begin with, severely constricted.
 ''Demand is driven by the baby boomers, 40 to 58 years of age,'' said Dr. Hughes at Rutgers, ''although it's a slightly younger boomer population that prevails in suburbia. And they are trading up.''
 ''They are moving to the house where they want to finish raising their children in the community they really want,'' Dr. Hughes continued. ''So single-family trade-ups have been been extraordinarily strong.''
 And in Manhattan, said Ms. Corcoran of the Corcoran Group: ''There's just much more money around now for good real estate. The high end of the market went dead for two to three years, but the Wall Street crowd has now brought the market right back over the top.''
 At the same time, she said: ''People aren't leaving for the suburbs like they used to. Retirees aren't going to Florida. And empty-nesters from the suburbs want to move back to the city.''
 All of that, Dr. Hughes concurred, ''increases the demand side of the equation in the region's walkable activity areas -- the Manhattan neighborhoods where you can walk to dinner, to the museums, take a short taxi ride to cultural destinations. Same for areas of Brooklyn that have their own high amenity levels, but also are closely tied to the unique attractions of Manhattan.''
 Another factor contributing to the inventory crunch, said Mr. Miller of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, has been ''a real change from buyer patterns of four or five years ago.'' 
 ''Buyers are not listing their apartments until they find an apartment to purchase,'' he said. ''So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: you're not going to sell until you buy, so there's limited choices to purchase.''
 In fact, said Ms. Corcoran, ''Many sellers are reneging on accepted offers a few days later as the reality hits, 'Where the heck am I going to move?' '' 
 Brokers -- like Ms. Sealy of the Park Avenue triple-apartment combination -- are left to scurry.
 Back in '95, two apartments on the same floor of 1100 Park Avenue, at 89th Street, were already on the market when the owner of the apartment between them died. With all due haste, Ms. Sealy pulled together the heirs to the middle apartment, the woman on one side -- ''she was very tough, held out for full asking'' -- and, by ship-to-shore radio, the owner of the third apartment. ''He was floating around the Mediterranean on a yacht,'' Ms. Sealy said. ''The phone bill came through at at least $143.''
 The total price for the three apartments, back then -- hard to believe now -- was $795,000.
 Flash forward to last fall: a client asks Ms. Sealy to find him a three-bedroom with a dining room, a maid's room and a library in a white-glove building. Ms. Sealy recalls the triple apartment at 1100 Park Avenue. The daughter of the couple living there has gone off to college.
 ''I put in a call,'' Ms. Sealy said. ''They said, 'O.K., we'll show it one time; he can make an offer then and there.' That was it.'' The price -- $3.2 million.
 Then, in a market of meager inventory, Ms. Sealy managed to find a smaller three-bedroom for the couple selling the triple, this one farther north on Park Avenue, and brokered a $2.8 million deal.
 It, too, was an estate sale. 
 ''There are two ways we get listings these days,'' Ms. Sealy said, ''D&D's -- death and divorce. So I got two deals out of it, and I was happy as could be.''

HEADLINE: Nurtured at Army Depot, Rare Deer Herd Is Suggested As a Key to Tract's Future

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: ROMULUS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
On thousands of acres that stretch across this town and a neighboring one, a creature exists so striking that decades ago military men decided to be, instead of its hunters, its protectors.
 The creature is a deer, but not the kind most people associate with hunting season or a lightning-quick leap across a road. It is a deer with a white coat and wide, flat horns. And brown is usually confined to its eyes. 
 ''I think they're beautiful,'' said Amanda Jensen as she gazed toward a cluster of the deer foraging for food, their coats bright amid the trees even at dusk.
 So do many other people, including a group of poorly financed conservationists who hope to persuade local government officials that it would be worthwhile to turn a herd of the white deer into an ecotourism attraction instead of parceling out the land that such a venture would require to businesses -- even though the region needs traditional, reliable jobs. ''There's no place else like this in the world,'' said Dennis J. Money, a member of the conservationists' group, known as Seneca White Deer. 
 The herd began through happenstance. In 1941, the Army built a munitions depot on 10,600 acres of farmland parallel to Seneca Lake, in the towns of Romulus and Varick, and put up a security fence around the perimeter.
 Inside the fence were hundreds of concrete munitions bunkers. But much of the land was left untouched, creating a refuge for wildlife, including several dozen white-tailed deer that carried a recessive gene allowing for white-coated offspring. In the mid-1950's, Army personnel first began seeing white fawns and decided to protect them even though the population had to be thinned every year to prevent collisions with military vehicles. 
 The herd of white deer grew, eventually becoming noticeable to passers-by on the two-lane road outside the depot. While some local residents joked that the deer were mutants resulting from nuclear weapons materials stored on the grounds, and others mistakenly thought they were albinos, a few, like the environmental photographer Leland Brun, recognized that they were a rare offshoot of the white-tailed species. ''They look like they're made out of marble,'' he said.
 The visibility of white deer makes them easy prey to hunters and natural enemies like coyotes. A few herds exist in North America and Europe, but none are as populated as the one here, which numbers 200 to 300, according to Mr. Money and Mr. Brun, who have studied it as part of the plan to turn the land into an ecotourism attraction. 
 After the first Persian Gulf war, the Army closed the depot and eventually transferred ownership of the mostly desolate property to Seneca County. The security fence remains, but is weathered and has been slit by poachers, Mr. Money said. 
 For the last several years, state and county officials have searched for uses for the land, hoping that its extensive infrastructure -- including an airstrip, road system and rail line -- will entice manufacturers. ''The only way to make a living here is to work for the government or farming,'' said Barry O'Neill, a member of the Seneca County Board of Supervisors. 
 Some new uses have been found. The northern tip is home to a boot camp for troubled teenagers. A state prison was built on the eastern rim, near a company that has transformed some Army buildings into a warehouse for restaurant supplies sold on eBay. A county jail is planned, too.
 But that still leaves most of the land untouched, including the meadows and woods that are home to the deer, osprey and other wildlife.
 In 2002, the county rejected all plans for development of that section, including one for a junkyard for old railroad cars and another for a hotel and a high-end range for hunting the white deer. 
 The conservationists' plan, which has the approval of the state Audubon Society but little funding, was also rejected.
 The plan calls for the group to manage, not buy, the land and turn the abandoned munitions bunkers into a cold war museum. Much of the open space would be used for bird- and deer-watching tours, and a fall hunt would be allowed to maintain the herd's overall health. The group estimates that about 100,000 people would visit each year, pumping $3 million into the local economy.
 With the county preparing for a new round of proposals this year, the conservationists' group plans to try again and has been almost as visible in the community as the deer themselves. ''They gave a talk to us the other night,'' Mr. O'Neill, the Board of Supervisors member, said. ''I had never given two thoughts about the proposal, but all of a sudden, it took on a new life.'' 
 Meanwhile, travelers are stopping their cars along the shoulder of the highway to catch a glimpse of the herd. ''From a distance you could see them,'' said Diane Starr, who was on her way home to Buffalo after visiting wineries with her friend, Aimee McCann. ''I said, 'Oh my gosh, wow.'''
 The women might have thought it was a wine-induced hallucination if not for a man taking pictures nearby. Ms. Starr jumped out to join him.
 Ms. Jensen, who lives right in town, has not tired of the deer since her fiance brought her to see the herd five years ago when they were dating. They have married, and now they bring their two young children to see them. Three-year-old Mikala, with eyes as big as a doe's, points to them, then covers her face shyly. 
 ''She loves them,'' Ms. Jensen says.

HEADLINE: In Albany, Opposing Views on the Mission of a Business Incentive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Depending on your point of view, the deal that the Geico insurance company struck to move 2,500 jobs to the Buffalo area in exchange for valuable tax breaks is either shining proof that one of New York State's main economic development programs works or further evidence of how far it has strayed from its original goal, revitalizing blighted areas.
 Gov. George E. Pataki hailed the deal as ''the start of a whole new era in western New York'' when he announced it in December. His administration says that those 2,500 jobs will improve the struggling regional economy and proudly points to the Geico agreement as a sign that the state's use of virtually tax-free zones, called Empire Zones, attracts businesses and brings solid, high-paying jobs to the state. 
 But critics note that the Geico development, a customer service center, will not be reviving a faded stretch of downtown Buffalo. Instead it is to be built in a suburban office park in nearby Amherst, which is sometimes known as the boom town on the rust belt and whose economy already outpaces the rest of the Buffalo region. Since the Amherst site was not in one of the state's Empire Zones, state and local officials trying to lure Geico there had to broker a complex deal so that the project would qualify for the tax breaks of a nearby zone. 
 ''The original idea of the program was that by offering deep tax breaks and coherent services, you could revitalize depressed urban and rural areas,'' said Frank Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed research group in Latham, N.Y. Mauro helped draft the law creating the state's original development zones in 1986, when he worked for the State Assembly. ''Now, instead of bringing businesses to the zones, the state is bringing the zones to the businesses. The whole focus has been lost.''
 That tension -- over whether the Empire Zones should stay true to their roots as a targeted anti-poverty program or continue to evolve into a more general economic development tool on the theory that a rising tide raises all boats -- is at the center of the debate as Governor Pataki and the State Legislature try to decide how they would like to change the program when it comes up for renewal in July.
 In addition, there are new questions about the program's effectiveness. Two audits released this month by State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi found that the zones, which will cost an estimated $291 million this year in lost tax revenue, rewarded some businesses that lost jobs -- a finding the Pataki administration disputes. 
 ''This happens to be one of our state's best economic development tools,'' said Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which administers the zone program in conjunction with local zone boards. But administration officials note that they are proposing amendments to make the tax benefits more proportional to the value of the jobs created and increase program oversight.
 In recent years the program has undergone significant, and costly, changes.
 It has grown from a handful of zones offering limited tax breaks in the late 1980's to 72 zones spread across the state that allow some businesses to operate virtually tax-free for a decade. Businesses can now qualify for sales tax exemptions, state reimbursements of local property taxes and business taxes, and savings on electricity and gas. And as the number of zones has expanded, the Pataki administration has moved from the notion that each zone must be a distinct geographic area; zone benefits are often accorded to pieces of land spread across an area. 
 As a result, the kinds of businesses benefiting from the tax breaks have evolved. There are still companies that get breaks for moving into distressed neighborhoods or old industrial cities and hiring local workers. And there are giants like I.B.M., which received tax credits when it built a chip fabrication plant in Fishkill, N.Y. 
 As the zones have proliferated, though, they have also come to include less traditional candidates for economic development money. Carr Public Affairs, an Albany lobbying firm, was awarded small tax breaks because it chose to refurbish a building near the Capitol. With the help of tax incentives, the Sagamore, an elegant resort on the shores of Lake George, plans to add a spa that will allow it to stay open year round. 
 Adding new zones, of course, has proved popular with state and local politicians who get to claim credit for bringing home tax cuts for local businesses and promises of new jobs for residents. And business groups are generally pleased that the Empire Zone benefits have been spread across the state, where more businesses can use them.
 ''There are economic development needs across the state,'' said Kenneth J. Pokalsky, the director of environmental and manufacturing programs for the Business Council of New York State, a lobbying group. ''We think it would be terrific if the entire state could be an Empire Zone.''
 But critics have questioned whether adding more zones will dilute their effectiveness, and whether the growth of zones in suburban areas will encourage suburban sprawl. A company can now reap just as many tax benefits for moving into the zone in Saratoga as it can for moving into the one in downtown Buffalo. In New York City, Staten Island has two Empire Zones, the same number as the Bronx. 
 Good Jobs First, a Washington-based research center that tracks the use of public subsidies, issued a report last year that found that states across the nation had changed their enterprise zone systems to permit their use in affluent areas. ''We found that, to be quite blunt, New York had one of the worst programs in the country, as far as changing to program from its original anti-poverty intent,'' said Alyssa Talanker, a co-author of the report. ''New York changed their zone law in more ways than any other state.''
 Within each zone, there are increasing questions about how the boundaries are drawn, and which companies are made eligible for the tax subsidies.
 A Buffalo News investigation last year found that the zone in Buffalo rewarded large corporations and influential executives; in a city where minorities make up 46 percent of the population, it reported, minority-owned firms made up just 5 percent of the companies certified for the program. The Post-Standard of Syracuse reported that millions of dollars in tax breaks in its local zone went to businesses that took advantage of a loophole that allowed them to simply reincorporate to pass themselves off as new.
 That loophole was closed in 2002, but not before businesses across the state squeezed through it.
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is the chairman of the committee on corporations, authorities and commissions, is investigating how officials draw the zone boundaries and decide which companies should get the benefits. ''There's a growing concern that the program has been politicized,'' he said.
 Democrats in the State Assembly say that they think the program, which they pushed to expand in 2000, has now strayed too far from its original goals. They complain that the Pataki administration changed the rules to allow noncontiguous zones without the approval of the legislature. They want to amend the law so that only economically distressed communities are considered, and to reconfigure the zones to make them more geographically contiguous. 
 The Assembly also wants more say in selecting the zones; Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, has bristled because the state has not approved a zone in Chinatown, which has suffered since Sept. 11, 2001, and which is in his district. 
 Their proposals could bump against some of Governor Pataki's proposals, which seek to give the state more flexibility in deciding where to put zones. And the Republican-controlled State Senate, which would like the program expanded so that every county in the state gets a zone, has a proposal to allow local governments to grant Empire Zone status to any high-tech or bio-tech firm that locates within their boundaries.
 The decision of what to do with the Empire Zones will most likely be made as part of the budget negotiations between the governor, the Assembly and the Senate. The budget is due by April 1 but is now on track to be late for the 20th consecutive year. The Albany leaders, though, have until the end of July to renew the Empire Zones law before it expires.

HEADLINE: A Question of Ethics: How to Teach Them?

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. STEWART

 BODY:
AS scandals ripple through the corporate world, some business schools have introduced ethics courses, tweaked existing ones and conducted classroom conversations about the implosions of major companies like Enron and WorldCom. 
 Yet many business school professors, deans and students say that change is happening gradually. 
 ''It's been slow going,'' said Fred J. Evans, dean of the College of Business and Economics at California State University at Northridge. In his opinion, he said, many business school professors are not yet well prepared to teach the subject. 
 ''Schools bear some of the responsibility for the behavior of executives,'' he said. ''If they're making systematic errors in the world, you have to go back to the schools and ask, 'What are you teaching?'''
 In an informal survey last spring, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, which accredits business school programs, found that 35 percent of its member schools required students to take an ethics course. That was virtually unchanged from the results of a more formal study in 1988, in which a third of the association's members required ethics courses. 
 Some elite schools, like Harvard, have started requiring ethics courses this year. ''We've been looking into this for a few years, but it took some time to build,'' said Lynn S. Paine, a professor of business administration and a leader in designing the new course.
 But other business schools have made no changes to their ethics curriculums. Many said their coverage of ethics was more than enough before the scandals broke. ''We don't have an ethics requirement,'' said Sharon P. Smith, the dean of Fordham University's Graduate School of Business. ''But we always talked about the subject in classes. It's a no-brainer for us. We don't shy away from questions of right and wrong.''
 Even when an ethics course is required, many students say the material is general or detached from the rest of the graduate curriculum. 
 ''You have five profit-oriented classes during the semester where you're learning about free markets and shareholder maximization, and then there's one mandatory ethics course,'' said Chris Andrews, 30, who is in his second year at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. ''It's an abrupt transition, a tough way to learn about ethics. And you wonder if it can really prepare you for the real world.''
 In a recent survey conducted by the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit research center, roughly half of the 1,700 graduate business students who were interviewed said they thought they would have to make a decision in the future that would test their values. Only 22 percent said their schools were doing ''a lot'' to prepare them to manage value conflicts. One in five respondents said they were not being prepared at all.
 ''Everyone comes out thinking they're an ethical person,'' said one recent graduate of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. ''And then all of a sudden you're working and there's money at stake.''
 The former student, who graduated in 2003, said that when he started work at an investment firm the summer after he graduated, he learned that the generic ethics cases used in school and the ethical situations encountered in the real world could be quite different. The contrast became particularly vivid, he said, when he spent several months researching a company in preparation for a big buyout and stumbled upon a number of potential problems that made him question the merit of the deal. 
 Everything ''is tied to making the deal happen at this point,'' he said. ''You have to ask yourself, 'Should I tell everyone there are some red flags and chance freaking everyone out and losing the account, or do I overlook it?''' he added. ''This isn't something I learned about in any of those case studies.'' He disclosed the problems to his firm, a decision he said was based more on his own moral code than anything else. His firm is still evaluating the company. 
 Dr. Amitai Etzioni, a sociology professor at George Washington University who taught ethics at Harvard Business School in the 1980's, said that while many business schools had begun offering ethics courses, ''they ghettoize the class.''
 ''And most of the time the message to students is, 'Find a good lawyer so you can justify what you're doing,''' he added. ''It doesn't tell you there are some basic values, that certain things are wrong.''
 ARCHIE CARROLL, a management professor who teaches ethics at the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia, says that adding ethics training does not appear to be a priority at many schools. ''I don't see governing boards at schools or advisory boards putting pressure on deans to teach more business ethics,'' he said. 
 Not long after corporate scandals began unfolding in late 2001 and early 2002, a group of professors and business executives began lobbying the business school accrediting association to require M.B.A. students to take a course in ethics. Late last year, however, the association said it would instead make the topic more prominent in its catalog of standards.
 The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, which has required M.B.A. students to take an ethics course since 1975, will begin offering a Ph.D. program in business ethics next fall. 
 The Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley recently started the Center for Responsible Business, which includes seven new ethics courses. The program will require first-year students to visit executives in jail.
 The Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh dropped its ethics requirement last year in favor of steeping every class with ethics. Professors are now required to take a course in ethics training. 
 ''We decided that having a separate ethics class was a lot like telling students that they could be bad during the week, but just had to go to church on Sunday,'' said Frederick W. Winter, dean of the school. ''By taking out the one course, I think we'll be making every other course richer in the subject.''

HEADLINE: Split Made Her, Too, a Source on Divorce

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MARGERY RUBIN'S bitter divorce was unusual in two ways. 
 First, her husband was an unusually formidable foe -- a prominent divorce lawyer who had handled more than his share of high-profile New York splits. 
 Second, after their four-year divorce battle finally ended, with what she calls an ''outcome I was happy with,'' she used the experience she had gained in the combative parting to start a business that provides the kind of guidance she says she could have used when her 22-year marriage crumbled.
 In 1995, a year after her divorce from Robert Stephan Cohen, Ms. Rubin gave up her career in fashion-related advertising and public relations to start DivorceSource, a one-woman firm that offers what she calls ''nonlegal counseling on the practical issues of divorce.'' 
 Ms. Rubin advises people on a variety of matters: how to interview, evaluate and choose a divorce lawyer; what the court experience will be like; options like settlements through mediation; how to put together a net worth statement; even how to draw up something as basic as a new budget to fit leaner financial circumstances.
 ''They often come in saying, 'I don't know where to begin,''' Ms. Rubin said of the approximately 75 clients a year she sees in her office on Park Avenue South in Manhattan. Most are women, and most are referred by accountants, psychologists and other professionals. 
 For many people confronting divorce, even seemingly simple steps can be overwhelming, she said, explaining why she had been able to build a business in which ''I do fairly well.''
 Ms. Rubin, who gave her age as ''50 plus,'' declined to discuss her revenues, other than to say that she had come a long way from her start-up days after her divorce. 
 Although the Internet is rife with divorce counselors and consultants who are not lawyers -- Ms. Rubin herself has no Web site to complement her Manhattan office -- just how many such businesses exist is anybody's guess. 
 The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics ''does not recognize divorce counseling as a distinct occupation,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, the bureau's New York regional commissioner. The agency's closest category is ''marriage and family therapists,'' of whom there are 22,000 in the country, he said. The New York State Labor Department also has no count of divorce counselors or consultants, and the state does not license or set standards for them. 
 The New York State Bar Association said it took no position on those businesses. But Brian J. Barney, a lawyer in Rochester who practices matrimonial law and is chairman of the group's Family Law Section, offered a mixed assessment.
 ''There are some who will be clearly able to add some value'' in a divorce case, he said, by helping a client put together a file of information that is ''totally organized,'' making time spent with a lawyer more productive. But many counselors and consultants, he said, ''will give legal opinions about what this stuff means,'' thus practicing law without a license and full knowledge.
 Ms. Rubin says she avoids legal matters in her advice to clients, and instead supplements a lawyer's efforts by providing nonlegal information and encouragement. 
 In any case, the knowledge spawned by her own divorce experience has been a salable commodity, at $400 for an initial two-hour consultation and $175 an hour for subsequent sessions. 
 Among the services she offers is suggesting several lawyers who she thinks may be compatible with a client. She said she had ''no affiliation with any lawyer'' and received no payments from lawyers engaged as a result of her referrals. 
 Some clients return to her while their legal cases are well under way, she said, for advice on matters that are beyond the lawyer's focus -- like whether to sell the house and take half the proceeds, or buy out the spouse's interest and stay in the house but face the upkeep on a tighter budget. 
 On matters like that, Ms. Rubin said, the divorce counselor ''can play out the various scenarios with people'' to help them make a well-considered decision.

HEADLINE: Airpower Museum Carefully Restores a Hangar

BYLINE: By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
WORKING without benefit of the original blueprints, a group of volunteers have begun work on the restoration of a 64-year-old hangar at Republic Airport in Farmingdale that houses the American Airpower Museum.
 Under the direction of Angelo Corva, a Manhasset architect, research is under way to be faithful to the original appearance of the 35,000-square-foot building while upgrading it for safety and energy efficiency.
 Drawings exist for the engines of the P-47 Thunderbolt fighter plane, which was manufactured at the airport during World War II for use by American, British and other Allied forces. But there are no plans for the building itself, said Mr. Corva, a principal at Angelo Francis Corva & Associates in Manhasset and chairman of the town of Hempstead's landmarks commission. 
 The museum, which opened in January 2000, is in Hangar 3, where planes were moved for final assembly and testing. It is one of only three of the original structures that are still in use on the 522-acre airport grounds, where 24 aviation buildings, ranging in size from a 300,000-square-foot assembly factory to a 20,000-square-foot hangar, once stood. The restoration of the hangar will cost the museum $750,000.
 The aviation industry continued at Republic with the construction of fighter planes that were used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, according to Jeffrey M. Clyman, the museum's founder and president, who referred to Hangar 3 as ''hallowed ground.'' 
 In the early 1980's, the company, then known as Fairchild-Republic, closed and the airport became the property of New York State. ''When Fairchild-Republic closed its doors, they threw everything out,'' Mr. Corva said.
 Mr. Corva said he was using photographs and field measurements and would be visiting sites with similar hangars, like Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, to piece together information that would help in authentically restoring Hangar 3.
 ''Some of these hangars that were built in 1940 had a simple basic design that was reproduced across the United States at air bases from New York to Hawaii, with no revisions to accommodate climates,'' said Mr. Corva, who is also studying various options that would make the museum hangar, which had a $5,000 heating bill last month, more energy-efficient. 
 One plan would be to replace all the windows, at a cost of $250,000, with glazed double-paned windows, which would reduce the infiltration of cold and warm air. 
 ''The hangar's facade is now 60 percent plain glass and 40 percent masonry,'' he said. ''Sixty years ago, they wanted to provide as much light as possible and energy was cheap. Today, new hangar construction would have lots of insulation on the walls and few, if any, windows.''
 REPLACING the windows while keeping their original look intact may be a problem because the existing metal window frames will not accept the thickness of double-paned glass. A new type of subframe that would be visible only from the interior will have to be designed to attach to the existing frame, Mr. Corva said. 
 Various options are also being analyzed for fixing the hangar's leaking roof. The underside of the asphalt roof, which has a steel framework, is made of wood, which over the years has been rotting. One option is to replace the wood with galvanized metal, but that would require removing the roof, Mr. Corva said. 
 He added: ''The benefit, though, would be that we could add insulation -- now there is none -- and a new roofing surface with solar-collecting panels. We wouldn't revise the structure, which sings of its era, but today it could be more efficient.''
 Another challenge involves repainting the six hangar doors, which are 25 feet high and have a total width of 150 feet. ''Because they are counterweighted to create a balance in the lifting process, we need to figure how to deal with the problems of applying pounds of paint yet keeping that balance,'' he said.
 Some parts of the restoration project have been completed. In December, the ''wheezing'' 60-year-old steam boiler was replaced with natural-gas-fired radiant heating in the roof's trusses, Mr. Corva said. ''It keeps the temperature moderate,'' he noted, ''and the structure and artifacts are not at risk now.'' 
 Another project completed last year involved creating a safe environment around the massive hangar doors, which roll upward like garage doors.
 Last year, a Bayport electrician, Gerard F. D'Andraia Sr., a principal in Electrical Systems Management L.L.C., invented a $2,500 interlocking warning system, which operates the doors while red lights flash and buzzers scream for 30 seconds.
 ''Before, no one knew when they would open or close,'' Mr. D'Andraia said. ''We wanted audio and visual warnings, and there is also a camera system so the operator can see the doors as they move.'' 
 Because the building is so old, there are a lot of safety issues, said Mr. D'Andraia, who for the past three years has volunteered 16 hours a week in upgrading the hangar's electrical system, at a cost of $60,000.
 ''We removed all the electrical hazards and replaced the antiquated wiring systems that had been breaking down, were exposed or jury-rigged over the years just to make it work,'' he said.
 Mr. Corva said future plans include reconstructing the hangar's one-room control tower, which was on the roof. It was removed when a five-story free-standing tower, which is now part of the museum complex, was built in 1944 about 800 feet from the hangar.
 During the restoration, the museum will also be consolidated. Currently, it occupies 75 percent of Hangar 3; the remainder is leased to Nassau Flyers, a flight school. The museum also shares half of a nearby 20,000-square-foot 77-year-old hangar with Select Aviation, another flight school. This month, a move has begun whereby the museum and Nassau Flyers will swap that space, thus giving the museum full use of Hangar 3. 
 The nonprofit museum has an annual operating budget of $250,000, which primarily comes from entrance fees, private donations and grants, according to Gary Lewi, a spokesman.
 Financing for the restoration and construction of exhibits is coming from various sources, including a $200,000 federal grant.
 The museum has 10 historic planes that are still operational, including a P-47 Thunderbolt, and other artifacts. Exhibits include a Tuskegee Airmen display, which was recently built by a volunteer group of professional carpenters from the Hauppauge-based Suburban New York Regional Council of Carpenters, a trade union, under the direction of its president, William Weitzman. The carpenters are currently constructing a Republic Aviation display.
 Some planes have been donated. Others are on permanent loan from the United States Air Force museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, with which the Airpower Museum is affiliated, Mr. Clyman said.
 According to Hugh Jones, airport director for the state Department of Transportation, which has managed the Republic Airport property since 1982, the rest of the 522 acres includes numerous tenants in buildings constructed over two decades, which lease their property. The Airpower Museum has a 17-year lease with an annual rent of $180,000, not including heat. 
 The various enterprises, such as corporations with flight departments, provided 1,374 jobs and had a $140 million impact last year on Long Island's economy, compared with $72 million 12 years ago, Mr. Jones said.
 Plans have been proposed for two hotels and a Stew Leonard's supermarket on the airport grounds.
 The public airport, which has two runways, is used by private planes and charters, including that of President Bush during his visit to Long Island earlier this month. 
 Every weekend in the summer and during special events, volunteer pilots fly some of the planes from the American Airpower Museum, which has 35,000 visitors a year. It is open year-round Thursday through Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is $9 for adults, $6 for senior citizens and veterans, and $4 for students and those on group tours. Further information is available on its Web site, www.americanairpowermuseum.com, or by calling (631) 293-6398.
 ''This museum represents living history,'' Mr. Clyman said. ''If these walls and beams could talk, it would be amazing.''

HEADLINE: Time for Optimism? Pessimism? Pick Your Gauge

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE stock market is stumbling after an 11-month rally in which the Standard & Poor's 500 index surged more than 45 percent. 
 Should investors be concerned that the market's slide could worsen? Or should they focus on the benefits of a correction, which could pave the way for a renewed rally?
 Corrections are normal in bull markets and are usually not fatal. But investors have new reasons for worry, including the pace of job creation in the United States and the recent terrorist attack in Spain. 
 History suggests that if the market recovers from its slump, its 2004 gains will not come close to matching last year's. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 2.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq composite index is off 3.1 percent and the S.&P. 500 is down 0.2 percent. 
 ''A correction hurts investor confidence and may lead to sharper declines,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Capital. ''But the good news is that a correction drives stocks down to levels that make more sense.''
 David Darst, chief investment strategist for the individual investor group at Morgan Stanley, predicted that the market would recover after a correction of 5 to 10 percent, but he cautioned investors to curb their expectations. The market is in ''a sideways trading range,'' he said, predicting that the S.&P. 500 is likely to have a total return of about 10 percent over the next 12 months, roughly a quarter of the gain since last March. 
 The market's near-term performance may depend on the strength of first-quarter earnings reports, which will begin rolling out in significant numbers in mid-April. Thomson First Call is forecasting operating earnings growth of 15.9 percent for the S.&P. 500, compared with the first quarter last year. That estimate is up from 13.4 percent in January. What chief executives say about the outlook for sales and the chances for hiring many new workers will also be important. 
 But Mr. Darst said that ''while corporate profits are O.K., jobs are not, and jobs are key to people's sentiment about the economy and the stock market.'' 
 Since reaching a 23-month peak on Feb. 11, the Dow has fallen as much as 5.7 percent, while the Nasdaq has dropped as much as 10 percent since a peak on Jan. 26. The Dow's fall was the first of more than 5 percent since March 2003, ending the 12th-longest run without such a correction since 1900, according to Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn. The Nasdaq has had three declines of 6.3 percent or more since last March.
 The S.&P., however, has avoided a 5 percent correction, rallying last week after declining 4.6 percent from Feb. 11 through last Monday. The S.&P. 500's uncorrected rally is now the ninth longest since 1962. But analysts still expect the 5 percent threshold to be breached, although many acknowledge that the market has been more resilient than they expected. 
 Several barometers of market performance, including the price-to-earnings ratio, new highs for individual stocks, the pattern of advancing and declining stocks, and levels of interest rates and inflation indicate that the market is not in a precarious position. These indicators suggest that a steep decline is not in the offing, and that an eventual rebound is.
 Based on current earnings, the price-to-earnings ratio for the S.&P. 500 was 23.3 at the end of February, according to Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. That is above the average of 16.1 since 1946, but considerably below the 32.4 average of 1999, the year before the stock bubble burst. And it is well below the high of 46.5 in January and March of 2002, when P/E's zoomed after earnings fell for five consecutive quarters.
 Many analysts, like Abby Joseph Cohen, the chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman Sachs, still say that the market is undervalued, based on models that include estimates of economic growth, inflation, earnings and interest rates.
 When the S.&P. 500 was near 1,100 on Monday, Ms. Cohen estimated that the market was undervalued by about 18 percent. Even after removing the positive impact of the recent drop in interest rates, which pushed down the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note to less than 4 percent two weeks ago, the market was undervalued by about 15 percent, she said. And even at the recent peak, she added, the market was about 10 percent undervalued.
 Another measure, the so-called Fed model, which weighs the relative value of stocks to bonds, shows the stock market further underpriced, currently by 33.3 percent.
 INDICATORS of investor sentiment show that the bullishness of early this year has receded. That is a positive development, because many analysts see extreme bullishness as a signal to sell stocks. The two-week average of the bullish sentiment index of the American Association of Individual Investors was at 84.8 percent on Jan. 23, the highest reading since the survey began in July 1987. By last week, that reading had fallen to 58 percent.
 In addition, measures of trading volume and the ratios of advancing and declining stocks indicate that the market is oversold because most of the trading volume is concentrated in declining stocks, according to Ned Davis Research. For those who follow these gauges, the data do not yet send a buy signal, but they do show an improving market environment. 
 Other data indicate that investors are still buying in many sectors of the market -- something they were not doing during the technology-led approach to the collapse in 2000. Broad demand for stocks can be measured in the weekly number of issues hitting new highs and new lows on the New York Stock Exchange. For the week ended March 12, there were 592 new highs, compared with only 38 new lows.
 Looking at such a broad array of indicators, Tim Hayes, global equity strategist at Ned Davis Research, concluded last week that although the market correction had further to go, ''the bulk of the decline is most likely behind us.''
 Mr. Hayes said that the stock market had not been ''this oversold since 2002'' and that the current environment was favorable because of low interest rates, a strong economy, better valuation and interest in a broader range of stocks ''In fact,'' he said, ''there's little doubt that what we're seeing is a healthy correction in an ongoing bull market, not the early stages of a new bear market.''
 Although this correction is expected to be contained, the global political environment is in some ways less favorable for stocks than it was just two months ago. The bombing in Madrid on March 11 has raised worries about the possibility of more attacks.
 In her report to clients last week, Ms. Cohen of Goldman Sachs said that ''investor risk aversion has risen in response to the terrorist attacks in Spain and mixed economic news in the United States.'' And Mr. Darst of Morgan Stanley said he did not think that the possibility of additional attacks was fully reflected in the stock market.
 The presidential election, many analysts say, has become so competitive that it is difficult to handicap, raising doubts about future economic, tax, spending and trade policies. William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston, said that this uncertainty might already be seeping into the stock market. 
 These risks are not necessarily included in the current economic and market models that provide optimism for stocks. Investor sentiment can be difficult to quantify, Mr. Rhodes said, yet it ''can be as important as what is actually going on, especially in the short run.'' 
 The positive economic outlook is also being challenged by higher energy prices and slow job creation. Oil and gasoline prices are adding costs that are equivalent to a tax on consumers. And the economy is still not producing the number of jobs needed to guarantee that economic growth can continue at a comfortable pace, many analysts say. 
 Even if the economic and geopolitical environment does not deteriorate, investors may have to endure a correction before the market begins to climb again. Since 1962, the S.&P. 500 has had 10 rallies, including the current one, that have lasted at least 343 calendar days without a 5 percent fall from the most recent high. Once the other nine rallies fizzled, the S.&P. 500 fell by an average of 10 percent.

Several barometers suggest that market valuations and investor sentiment are not at extreme levels. Price-to-earnings ratios are high on a historical basis, but well below recent peaks. More stocks recently have reached new highs than new lows.

HEADLINE: Harrison McCain, 76, King Of the Frozen French Fry

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
Harrison McCain, a Canadian billionaire whose family-owned business began in a cow pasture in New Brunswick and grew into one of the world's largest producers of frozen French fries, died Thursday night. He was 76. 
 Mr. McCain's company, McCain Foods, confirmed his death, which occurred in Boston at the Lahey Clinic. He had been ill for some time, the company said. 
 Mr. McCain, a straight-talking son of a seed potato exporter, applied his prodigious ability as a salesman to an idea for a product that would become a global commodity and a calling card of American culture: the frozen French fry.
 In 1957, together with his three brothers, Wallace, Robert and Andrew, Mr. McCain opened a French fry processing plant in his hometown, Florenceville, a hamlet of fewer than 1,000 people in western New Brunswick, less than 10 miles from the American border.
 Pugnacious with a direct manner, Mr. McCain was an acknowledged workaholic. A 1998 profile in Maclean's Magazine, a Canadian weekly, counted 140 nights in a year that he had spent in a company jet's sleeping compartment en route to factories in Europe, Asia and the United States. 
 ''Business is such a large share of my time and my thought process,'' he told The Financial Post, an affiliate of The National Post, a Canadian daily, in that year. ''It's the only game in town.''
 Before he became known as the king of the frozen French fry, Mr. McCain worked as a salesman for Irving Oil, a Canadian energy company. He received a bachelor's degree in economics from Acadia University in 1949. 
 His vigor and drive expanded his company, with 30 employees, into a global empire worth billions. Annual sales reached $6.4 billion last year. The company now employs about 18,000 people in 55 facilities in more than 10 countries. It estimates that it produces one out of every three frozen French fries in the world.
 Even as the business grew, neither Mr. McCain -- who ranked 472nd in the Forbes Magazine 2004 list of billionaires with an estimated worth of $1.2 billion -- nor the company's corporate headquarters ever left the rural farming town.
 The business was not without problems. In 1994, Mr. McCain's younger brother and business partner of more than 30 years, Wallace, was forced out of McCain Foods, after relations soured over who would prevail in steering the business. In the same year, his wife, Marion McNair, died from cancer and just three years later, one of his sons, Peter, died in a snowmobile accident.
 Even so, the company continued to expand with Mr. McCain at its helm, and in 1997, it bought an American rival, Ore-Ida, for $500 million. It also makes fruit juice and various other frozen foods, including pizza, vegetables and desserts.
 But it was always French fries that were the centerpiece of Mr. McCain's selling strategy, which he conceived just as fast food began to take off in America. McDonald's, which first opened in 1948, is one of the company's biggest buyers. There are straight-cut fries, crinkle-cut fries, and flat round fries cut to look like smiley faces. Higher on the French-fry food chain are Frites Provencial, with olive oil and herbs, sold in Europe. French fries are ''part of the inexorable Americanization of the world,'' said Mr. McCain in the 1998 interview with The Financial Post. ''That Americanization is Coca-Cola, blue jeans, American movies, American music and French fries.''
 Mr. McCain appointed his nephew, Allison McCain, son of his late brother Andrew, as his successor in 2002. Mr. McCain remained as a member of the board.
 He is survived by his son Mark; three daughters, Ann Evans, Laura McCain-Jensen and Gillian McCain; his brother, Wallace McCain; and his sister, Marie Sutherland.

HEADLINE: Grants and Rails, and the Debate in Between

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
There is only $1,163,955,348.58 left.
 Though that sounds like a lot, it is not enough to cover the many claims on the federal grants for rebuilding Lower Manhattan.
 These competing claims expose something of a divide between the established downtown, an unalloyed business hub, and the emerging downtown, with its residential overlay. It is not that businesses and residents disagree on the broad goal of creating a lively mixed-use area. But they may struggle over the spending needed to get there. 
 As the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation decides how to allocate the rest of the federal community development block grants in coming months, perhaps the biggest battle will involve a proposed rail link from downtown, along the tracks of the Long Island Rail Road, to Kennedy International Airport and Long Island. 
 ''This project must be treated as priority one,'' said Thomas A. Renyi, chairman and chief executive of the Bank of New York, which has been in Lower Manhattan for 220 years. In a speech on Wednesday to the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, he said the link would open downtown to a ''most underserved'' pool of potential workers on Long Island. 
 But 51 percent of 646 Lower Manhattan residents surveyed three weeks ago by the Pace Poll at Pace University said they opposed construction of a rail link between downtown and Kennedy Airport if it used up all the federal grants. (The question did not mention the rest of Long Island.) Forty-two percent agreed with supporters.
 And the rail link emerged as priority No. 5 in an informal poll of 150 New Yorkers at a meeting on Tuesday sponsored by the Regional Plan Association and the Fiscal Policy Institute. Those who attended put housing at the top of their lists.
 ''There is clearly a consensus forming in Lower Manhattan that the remaining rebuilding funds should support neighborhood projects, not a rail link to the airport,'' said David Dyssegaard Kallick, senior fellow at the institute, which assesses city and state budgets and economic issues. 
 Lower Manhattan is not alone in wrestling with the potential costs and benefits of ambitious transportation projects. Others under debate include the Second Avenue subway line, the westward extension of the No. 7 subway line and the opening of Grand Central Terminal to L.I.R.R. trains.
 In the case of the Long Island-Lower Manhattan rail link, much depends on a study to be released next month that will recommend an actual route, which will in turn suggest the cost. Choices include digging a new tunnel under the East River or using the existing subway tunnels. 
 The issue downtown is not so much opposition to the link as it is a question of whether that project should be financed, even in part, by a block grant from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation was awarded $2.783 billion in grants, of which, the corporation said, it has now allocated $1,619,044,651.42. 
 That leaves the $1,163,955,348.58 in unallocated grants. A $50 million housing subsidy plan is currently going through public review. Aside from that, the rest of the money is not yet earmarked. 
 Without commenting specifically on any potential use for the money, Kevin M. Rampe, president of the development corporation, said Friday, ''Our overall philosophy has certainly been that if you use public dollars to build infrastructure, that will lead to a growth in private development that will be critical in moving Lower Manhattan forward.''
 ''Obviously,'' Mr. Rampe said, ''we're not going to solve all of Lower Manhattan's problems with the $1 billion we have left.''
 Customarily, community development block grants are used to provide decent housing and economic opportunities for people with low or moderate incomes, to eliminate blight or to meet recent threats to a community's health or welfare.
 But the language of the appropriation act for Lower Manhattan confers broader discretion. It said the money was being awarded for ''assistance for properties and businesses damaged by, and for economic revitalization related to, the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City, for the affected area of New York City.''
 Gov. George E. Pataki said through a spokeswoman on Friday that ''both short-term initiatives and long-term projects are critical to rebuilding Lower Manhattan as a central business district that is also a vibrant, 24-hour mixed-use community.''
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's vision for Lower Manhattan includes improving Fulton Street and the East River waterfront and encouraging the development of cultural institutions. ''We still believe that L.I.R.R.-airport access, enhancing the connectivity to Lower Manhattan, is absolutely critical to maximize the potential of Lower Manhattan,'' Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said on Friday. ''But in addition, there are other investments that have to be made, truly creating the 24/7 community.''
 After the meeting Tuesday, Jeremy Soffin, the public affairs director of the Regional Plan Association, wrote in the association's newsletter, ''The great irony here is that the best way to secure Lower Manhattan's place as a thriving business district may be to invest C.D.B.G. funds in creating nonbusiness activities -- by investing in local economic development, civic amenities and arts and culture.''

HEADLINE: The Socratic Shrink

BYLINE: By Daniel Duane. 
Daniel Duane is the author of ''A Mouth Like Yours,'' a novel to be published next year by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.

 BODY:
On a recent Manhattan morning, with a cold wind slashing off New York Harbor, Lou Marinoff took the granite steps of the federal courthouse two at a time -- brown eyes fierce, ivory white skin offsetting his dark beard, a Russian fur hat making him the very picture of the engaged intellectual. A tenured philosophy professor at City College of New York and the author of ''The Big Questions: How Philosophy Can Change Your Life'' and of the international best seller ''Plato, Not Prozac! Applying Eternal Wisdom to Everyday Problems,'' Marinoff is the world's most successful marketer of philosophical counseling. A controversial new talk therapy, philosophical counseling takes the premise that many of our problems stem from uncertainties about the meaning of life and from faulty logic. 
 Passing through courthouse security, Marinoff placed his World Economic Forum tote bag in the metal detector -- swag from his annual gig in Davos, Switzerland, and filled that morning with documents for Marinoff's lawsuit against his own employer. Claiming a violation of his freedom of speech, the case stems from a C.C.N.Y. moratorium on Marinoff's campus counseling, instituted while administrators looked into liability questions. What if a philosopher with zero mental health training, they worry, fails to recognize a student's suicidal tendencies and prescribes Heidegger instead of psychiatric intervention? The moratorium is no longer officially in effect, but Marinoff is suing for lost income and professional opportunities, and C.C.N.Y. attorneys have also laid out insurance requirements that Marinoff finds utterly offensive: ''We have never, not ever, had a single case in which philosophical counseling caused psychological harm,'' he said in the courthouse elevator. ''These people just can't tell the difference between psychology and philosophy. That's how badly educated people are these days.'' 
 The lawsuit is only one of several fronts in Marinoff's crusade to make philosophical counseling a mainstream profession, and to make himself its public face. His message, spoken in a defensive staccato, goes like this: Americans are tired of psychologists dwelling on our every painful feeling, we're sick of psychiatrists prescribing a new drug every time we feel confused and many of our most pressing problems aren't even emotional or chemical to begin with -- they're philosophical. To wit: You don't have to be clinically depressed or burdened by childhood guilt to want help with the timeless questions of the human condition -- the persistence of suffering and the inevitability of death, the need for a reliable ethics. ''Even sane, functional people need principles to live by,'' Marinoff told me, his voice lowering without slowing in the sun-flooded courtroom, ''so we are offering what Socrates called the examined life, the chance to sit with a philosopher and ask what you really believe and make sure it's working for you.'' 
Regardless of C.C.N.Y.'s unease about philosophical counseling, the public appears ready and eager for at least some form of philosophy in the daily diet. Witness Tom Morris, a former Notre Dame professor, charging the likes of I.B.M. and General Electric up to $30,000 an hour for his lecture on the ''7 C's of Success,'' distilled from Cicero and Spinoza, Montaigne and Aeschylus. Christopher Phillips, author of ''Six Questions of Socrates'' (just out from W. W. Norton), has been traveling the country engaging spontaneous crowds in Socratic dialogue about the nature of justice and the meaning of courage. And ''Philosophy Talk,'' a new San Francisco-based radio show modeled on NPR's ''Car Talk,'' offers two wisecracking Stanford professors -- and their many call-in guests -- tackling thorny matters like ''Is Lying Always Bad?'' and ''Would You Want to Live Forever?''
 As for philosophical counseling, in which the philosopher serves as a kind of life coach/bodhisattva, the practice does have a toehold in Europe, Israel, South Africa, India and especially the U.K., where Alain de Botton's 2000 best seller, ''The Consolations of Philosophy,'' became a six-part television series. Marinoff wasn't the first to try philosophical counseling in the United States, but he's way ahead of the pack when it comes to building the institutions of legitimacy and seeking access to the river of money known as health-insurance reimbursement. 
 Like any entrepreneur cornering a new market, Marinoff has worked fast and furiously, sometimes bruising competitors along the way. In short order, he has established the American Philosophical Practitioners Association (A.P.P.A.), started a series of three-day counselor-certification weekends and begun setting up an academic journal. Before those pesky lawyers got involved, he was even performing research on human volunteers at C.C.N.Y. and arranging for a New York foundation to finance free philosophical counseling through the C.C.N.Y. campus wellness center. 
 Marinoff does have his fans - Vaughana Feary, a New Jersey-based practitioner and A.P.P.A. board member, says that Marinoff's books bring her a steady stream of would-be clients. But to many of the other philosophical counselors in this country -- and to quite a few overseas -- Marinoff may be the worst thing ever to happen to their fledgling field. Shlomit Schuster, an Israeli practitioner, calls ''Mr. Marinoff's overpopularizing presentation a worldwide embarrassment for the profession,'' and David O'Donaghue, a licensed psychologist with a doctoral background in philosophy, says that Marinoff ''is not a scholar, he's not a guy who should be leading a country'' in philosophical counseling. ''This is an infant field, and we're all asking questions.'' O'Donaghue says that he considers Marinoff's three-day certification efforts ''ludicrous'' and that ''the psychologists are laughing at us!'' Marinoff's strongest competition, in fact, comes from the American Society for Philosophy Counseling and Psychotherapy (A.S.P.C.P.), which is devoted to precisely the opposite tack -- seeking bridges to the established professions. According to Elliot D. Cohen, one of the society's executive directors, who has a Ph.D. in philosophy from Brown University and is a certified practitioner of rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), a common form of talk therapy, ''The biggest obstacle to philosophical counseling's growth in the U.S. is its acceptance by the established mental health fields, because we're the newest kid on the block. And what are people in those fields saying now? With Marinoff certifying people who have no clinical training? They're saying, 'Philosophers don't know anything about mental health, and they're going to serve as an endangerment to clients.'''
 Marinoff considers his philosophical practice all the clinical training he needs, and could be on the verge of rendering the question moot. Ruben Diaz Jr., New York State assemblyman for the 85th District in the Southeast Bronx, said he believed so strongly that his constituents could use philosophical help that he is pursuing the only thing that can make it affordable: New York State certification of the profession, and the H.M.O. co-pays that certification makes possible. To that end, Diaz has written to the New York State commissioner of education, asking that certified philosophical counselors be recognized under a 2002 law that grants state licensing to marriage-and-family therapy and creative arts therapy. Most important, Diaz, who first heard about philosophical counseling through Marinoff, has suggested that the state recognize Marinoff's own A.P.P.A. as an official certificate-granting body. 
 Diaz explained that there are those who ''make bad decisions, based on economic pressures. We have single mothers, families broken, people getting sick. Philosophical counseling teaches people about moral and ethical choices. If this is available to our young people, it might better their lives.'' 
As in the early days of psychoanalysis, and the famous rift between Freud and Jung, philosophical counselors disagree on everything from the best name -- philosophical practice? public philosophy? -- to whether they should be trying to cure people, empower them or guide them to self-understanding. Thus far, only Cohen and Marinoff have branded easily comprehended techniques. Cohen's logic-based therapy builds on the work of his mentor Albert Ellis, who invented REBT. Citing the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus, and the insight that it is not the events in our lives that cause us suffering but the way we interpret them, Ellis sees much of our unhappiness as based on irrational assumptions, like demanding perfection from yourself and others. Cohen teaches critical-thinking skills that help us identify those irrational assumptions and correct them.
 Marinoff and other practitioners hold that we all have a philosophy of life, whether we know it or not, and that we can benefit from identifying that philosophy, making sure it helps us rather than hinders us -- defining success, say, in a way we might actually achieve it -- and then strengthening it through dialogue with the great thinkers. Where Marinoff departs from the others, and sets their teeth on edge, is in the way he packages the journey of philosophical self-improvement. In ''Plato, Not Prozac!'' for example, Marinoff outlines a five-step ''PEACE process'' that seems ready-made for daytime TV: identify the Problem, take stock of your Emotions, Analyze your options, Contemplate your entire situation and then -- voila! -- reach Equilibrium. 
 Citing privacy concerns, Marinoff declined to give contact information for any of his clients, but in ''Plato, Not Prozac!'' he includes a case study of ''Doug,'' a late-night-radio talk-show host. Doug sees his Problem as his inability to be happy without a woman to love and the impossibility of meeting a woman while he works the graveyard shift. Doug's Emotion is loneliness, and his Analysis of possible options turns up only two: leaving his job or being lonely forever. That's where Marinoff comes in: trying to free Doug from the mental trap he has built for himself, Marinoff encourages Contemplation of Eastern philosophy. Namely, the Taoist warning against craving things we've decided we cannot have, and the Buddha's reminder that what we experience in life is what we have previously willed. In short: stop obsessing on your need for love, stop thinking you'll never find it. Then will your life into the shape you'd like for the future. 
 Among serious academic philosophers -- even those who address the so-called human-condition questions -- there is an almost visceral revulsion at the very idea of philosophical counseling. Jonathan Lear, a psychoanalyst and philosophy professor at the University of Chicago, considers himself committed both to the therapeutic power of conversation and to the Socratic philosophical tradition of investigating life's pressing concerns. He is deeply skeptical, nevertheless, of any counseling approach that imagines that you can dwell purely in the realm of reason, ignoring hidden motive and unresolved feeling, ''That's a fantasy,'' Lear said by phone. ''And you don't have to be a Freudian to think so. One of the most looming problems for Plato about the human soul is that there's a powerful unconscious dimension.'' 
 For Alva Noe of the University of California, Berkeley, the problem is much simpler: ''While there is every reason to think that philosophical method and rigor, when applied to life's problems, can lead to growth, emancipation, improvement, et cetera, philosophy is very, very hard. How many people really get a life turnaround from practicing kung fu or tai chi?'' 
Raised in Montreal, Marinoff followed a somewhat circuitous route to his role as philosophical counseling's American figurehead. In the 1960's, he was a middle linebacker- aka Animal -- on his high-school football team, and he lived on a kibbutz before spending the 1970's wandering North Africa and then playing electric guitar for the Dog Brothers, a hard-rock group. Married with a young son in the 1980's, Marinoff put much of his considerable energy into table hockey -- becoming the three-time Canadian Open champion. After philosophy doctoral work at University College London and post-doctoral research at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Marinoff helped organize the first international conference on philosophical counseling in 1994. 
 Marinoff landed his job at C.C.N.Y. later that year, applying soon after for approval to do counseling research on human subjects. In the meantime, he became active in what was then the only philosophical counseling group in the country, the A.S.P.C.P. The board, including its co-founder, Elliot Cohen, elected Marinoff president in 1996, and at first, the two worked in concert -- Cohen wrote a professional code of ethics, another board member established mentor and internship guidelines for professional certification and Marinoff talked C.C.N.Y. into contributing $5,000 for the Third International Conference on Philosophical Practice. 
 But it was at that conference in July 1997 that Marinoff announced that the A.S.P.C.P. was certifying counselors and that a test was already available. The response was decidedly mixed. Shlomit Schuster perceived a power grab by the A.S.P.C.P. board, granting themselves undue authority. O'Donaghue protested that certification was premature for such an embryonic field. Marinoff did not take this lying down. ''He just blasted us,'' O'Donaghue said. ''He let us know this was his baby.'' 
 Within days of the conference's ending, Assemblyman Diaz called, as did literary agents wanting a book proposal. Five months later, at the December meeting of the A.S.P.C.P., the board voted Marinoff executive director and, according to Cohen, asked him to look into professional malpractice insurance and nonprofit status, in order to establish the A.S.P.C.P. as a legal certifying body. Marinoff agreed to do all this but, as he recalls it, he was already quietly talking to certain board members about incorporating an entirely different nonprofit society, one that he could run, as he put it recently, like ''a C.E.O. instead of an academic committee chair.'' Marinoff said he never mentioned this to the full A.S.P.C.P. board because it was a private matter. 
 Then in March 1998, to the surprise of Cohen and other board members, they received an e-mail message from Marinoff inviting them to become ''honorary members'' of his new organization, something called the American Philosophical Practitioners Association (A.P.P.A.). 
 Marinoff stepped down as executive director of the A.S.P.C.P. later that year, and the embryonic field of philosophical counseling suffered its first full-blown professional schism. ''I think the American practitioners all kind of fell apart after that,'' O'Donaghue told me. ''We got a lot of anger from Lou,'' he said, describing Marinoff's bullying. ''We wilted.'' Marinoff ''did the same thing the following year at the conference in Cologne. He was a keynote speaker, and he talked about the 'clowns' trying to practice philosophical counseling without even being trained, and he was speaking about many of the practitioners in the room. As if he was trained.'' 
 O'Donaghue continued: ''He's done so much damage, and if he gets in trouble, which I think he will, the movement might fall. Psychoanalysis really got identified with Freud, but Freud was brilliant. Marinoff is just self-promoting. He's like the emperor without any clothes. He's built something up and said, 'If I build up an illusion, people will start believing in it, and then it will become real.'''
When Marinoff left the federal courtroom that morning in January, he headed off to tape an interview that he said was for a Hollywood producer pitching him to Fox Television. Marinoff has had extraordinary success since the break with the A.S.P.C.P. - ''Plato, Not Prozac!'' translated into more than 20 languages, his annual visit to Davos. Crossing Lower Manhattan, Marinoff walked and talked with extraordinary vigor about his coming talk at the East Asia Economic Summit in South Korea and about a three-day training session he'll give in Genoa, Italy, next month. Meanwhile, Assemblyman Diaz says he is optimistic about state licensing. The process won't fully unfold until next year, but the commissioner of education has asked Marinoff for documentation about the A.P.P.A. If it all works out (by no means a foregone conclusion), Marinoff said excitedly, ''certified philosophical practitioners -- C.P.C.'s, if you will -- become eligible for reimbursement by insurance companies. Immediately, we will be on a level playing field with the other helping professions.'' 
 Though C.C.N.Y. attorneys give no indication of wanting to settle the lawsuit, Marinoff, in his relentless drive forward, insists that they're getting scared. ''I'm perfectly willing to drop the suit if they'll partner with me -- on setting up a graduate program and the scholarly journal and my research, and all the rest,'' Marinoff said. ''I am not a litigious person. I have only been doing what is in the interest of philosophers and the general public. It's a pioneering effort, a global thing, and the university should be proud to be the center of it.'' Describing his grand -- even grandiose -- plans for a philosophical-counseling empire fills Marinoff with a combative intensity. ''We are already training and certifying practitioners,'' he said, his voice gaining speed. ''We could have them delivering services in prisons and elder-care facilities and hospitals working alongside of doctors. We could have ethicists helping people make difficult end-of-life decisions. We could be rendering services to governments all over the world. We could basically make philosophy more popular than it's been since the days of the agora, in ancient Greece.''

LIFE ON THE OUTSIDE
The Prison Odyssey of Elaine Bartlett.
By Jennifer Gonnerman.
356 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $24.
 The United States is transforming itself into a nation of ex-convicts. This country imprisons people at 14 times the rate of Japan, eight times the rate of France and six times the rate of Canada. The American prison system disgorges 600,000 angry, unskilled people each year -- more than the populations of Boston, Milwaukee or Washington. ''Thirteen million people have been convicted of a felony and spent some time locked up,'' Jennifer Gonnerman writes in ''Life on the Outside.'' ''That's almost 7 percent of U.S. adult residents. If all of these people were placed on an island together, that island would have a population larger than many countries, including Sweden, Bolivia, Senegal, Greece or Somalia.''
 Ex-cons are marooned in the poor inner-city neighborhoods where legitimate jobs do not exist and the enterprises that led them to prison in the first place are ever present. These men and women are further cut off from the mainstream by sanctions that are largely invisible to those of us who have never been to prison. They are commonly denied the right to vote, parental rights, drivers' licenses, student loans and residency in public housing -- the only housing that marginal, jobless people can afford. The most severe sanctions are reserved for former drug offenders, who have been treated worse than murderers since the start of the so-called war on drugs. The Welfare Reform Act of 1996, for example, imposed a lifetime ban on food stamp and welfare eligibility for people convicted of even a single drug felony. The states can opt out of the prohibition, but where it remains intact it cannot be lifted even for ex-prisoners who live model, crime-free lives.
 Drug offenders, many of them former addicts, have been consigned to civic purgatory with no clear route to redemption. Gonnerman, a staff writer for The Village Voice, traces this disastrous policy back 30 years to the presidential ambitions of Nelson Rockefeller, the Republican New York governor who was denied his rightward-rushing party's presidential nomination because he was seen as too liberal. Rockefeller sought to prove his ''tough on crime'' bona fides through a widely emulated package of drug laws that has come to be his chief legacy. The legislature rejected a Rockefeller proposal that would have required a life sentence for the highest level drug felony, known as A-1, but adopted a similar sanction that set the mandatory minimum sentence at 15 to life -- which meant that hard-core judges could go higher if they chose.
 A sentencing policy that had once penalized petty street-corner peddlers less severely than drug kingpins no longer considered the perpetrators' level of involvement in the trade. Now everything hinged on the weight of the drugs. A conviction for selling at least two ounces of heroin or cocaine meant A-1 -- which meant a long, long stay in jail. Under the law, two ounces were as bad as two kilos. The first-time offender who gave in to the siren song of an easy score and the junkie selling watered-down smack to feed a habit were no different under the law from the full-timer who moved serious weight. 
 Rockefeller reveled in the fact that he had passed the toughest drug law in the country. But as Gonnerman notes, he ''had helped launch a new experiment in crime control, one that would have repercussions in every corner of the country for decades to come.'' The states were soon competing to see who could lock up the most people for the longest periods of time. The national prison population skyrocketed, from a modest 200,000 in 1973 to an eye-popping two million today, at a cost to the country of about $55 billion per year. States were soon forced to choose between building roads and schools and building prisons. 
 Mass imprisonment has not hindered the drug trade. Indeed, drugs are cheaper and more plentiful today than ever. In addition, many of the addicts who are held in jail for years at a cost of more than $20,000 per inmate per year could be more cheaply and effectively dealt with in treatment. What jumps out at you from ''Life on the Outside'' is the extent to which imprisonment has been normalized, not just for adults from poor communities but for children who visit their parents in prison. Spending holidays and birthdays behind bars for years on end, these children come to think of prison as a natural next step in the process of growing up. 
 ''Life on the Outside'' tells this story through the family of Elaine Bartlett, a young mother of four who received a sentence of 20 to life for her first offense -- selling cocaine to an undercover cop in a motel near Albany. Bartlett was pardoned after 16 years and went on to speak publicly about the evils of the Rockefeller drug laws. She rails against the unfairness of the law, but she was hardly naive when she decided to carry a package of cocaine from New York to Albany together with her boyfriend, Nathan Brooks, a petty dealer with whom she shared an apartment. Elaine had grown up in Harlem during the 60's and 70's, when the neighborhood that has become newly fashionable today was a burned-out shell and the epicenter of the heroin trade. Elaine's mother, Yvonne, had been arrested for selling heroin for pocket money and Yvonne's boyfriend had died of an overdose. 
 When Elaine took that train from New York to Albany, she was hoping for a quick score of $2,500, perhaps to buy some furniture and hold a nice Thanksgiving dinner for her family. She and Nathan, however, were ensnared in a buy-and-bust and hauled before one of the toughest drug judges in the state. While at trial, Elaine was startled to see the man who had lured her to Albany take the stand as a witness for the prosecution. The man was George Deets, a drug dealer and addict who ran a drug-trafficking operation while working as an informant for the state police. Deets has since died of an overdose. Even so, the story of how he maintained an intimate relationship with the state police while freely selling large amounts of drugs -- and fingering other dealers elsewhere -- merits further investigation. It also underscores a problem with how the police have operated under the Rockefeller system.
 Gonnerman writes that Deets typically volunteered to serve as an informant -- which meant trawling for fresh meat in Harlem -- whenever he was arrested on a drug charge. He waltzed down to New York and lured the mark up to Albany County, making sure there was enough drug present for an A-1 bust. The mark sold the drugs to the cops, who were grateful for the collar, and Deets lived to traffic another day. 
 Elaine's children were 10, 6, 3 and 1 when the judge sent her to jail. The most heartbreaking scenes in ''Life on the Outside'' depict Bartlett huddled with her four young children in prison visiting rooms. The family gathered every weekend and posed for pictures taken by the visiting-room photographer. The years wear on and the children grow up before our eyes, suffering all of the problems that might be expected in young people traumatized by the absence of a beloved parent. The prison visiting rooms have become a bizarre lovers' lane where teenagers strike up relationships with people from other prison families or with inmates themselves. With each generation, the families grow steadily more accustomed to living their lives in captivity. By the time Elaine is pardoned, her mother, who has cared for the children, is dead, and the wreckage of her extended family is too much to bear. Most of this moving and well-reported book deals with Elaine's struggle to create a life for herself outside the prison walls -- by finding a job, a place to live, and by reconnecting with her thoroughly damaged family. This ground is familiar, but revelatory too, as when Elaine realizes that she has exchanged the prison behind bars for the prison that awaits ex-offenders who try to make it in the real world. 
 Her worst nightmare comes true when her teenage son, Jamel, who grew up in the visiting room, follows in his mother's footsteps and goes to jail himself. Jamel is visited inside by a 15-year-old girlfriend who is too young even to enter the gates but gets in with a fake ID. The girl becomes pregnant by Jamel, who has left jail briefly only to return, and the cycle begins anew.

HEADLINE: Just-in-Time Hiring In a Growing Economy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Productivity and Jobs: The Political Vagaries'' (Economic View, March 7) described how rising productivity rates could result in less hiring. But technological efficiencies, from electronic resumes and job listings to the computerized matching of jobs and skills, have also benefited personnel management.
 In the old days, management would overhire at the beginning of an expansion and trim workers later, with little regard for the costs involved. 
 But the high-tech advancements have made the hiring process much more exact and seamless. Workers can be hired ''just in time'' for business needs. So, as the economy grows, more jobs will be added, but in a more refined way than in the past.

HEADLINE: When College Graduates Struggle to Find Jobs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''In This Recovery, a College Education Backfires'' (Economic View, March 14) described how more college graduates have found themselves unemployed as American companies have downsized and outsourced more work overseas.
 But in what fields are these unemployed college students getting their degrees? There is one issue, and the most serious, when their degrees are in science, engineering, medicine or business. On the other hand, I hear of many students who get their degrees in subjects they happen to like -- whether art history, geography, literature or other areas -- that have limited appeal to business at this time of economic recovery. Whatever the reason for their unemployment, college graduates face additional misery in trying to repay student loans of tens of thousands of dollars.
 Perhaps the real question is whether college career counselors are giving the best advice to their students.

DIVE
By Lisa Teasley.
Bloomsbury, $23.95.
 What could have been a disaster -- the superimposing of an earnestly tender love story onto an Elmore Leonard-ish tableau of killers, drifters and even a former porn star -- turns out to be an affecting first novel, thanks to Lisa Teasley's avoidance of sentimentality and her thoughtfully spiky characterizations. Ruby Falls, an animator for a children's television series, leaves Los Angeles for a mind-cleansing trip to Alaska after witnessing the aftermath of a gruesome murder. There she meets Ray Rose, a Florida construction worker trying to come to terms with his own (justifiably) homicidal past. After quickly confirming their sexual compatibility, Ruby and Ray sanguinely resolve to settle down in Florida; their journey toward domestic bliss is progressing when a near-fatal accident breaks their rhythm. Teasley can write with a poet's economy (a tune too casually whistled by a friend at an accident victim's bedside is described, briefly and perfectly, as ''soapy and disloyal''), and she never forgets that even the most devoted of lovers can also be petty, jealous and unattractively needy at times. Even if the suspense surrounding Ray's past is wrapped up too tidily, there's still plenty of tension in wondering how these two will manage to maintain their tenuous grip on happiness.

HEADLINE: Outsource

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
'Outsourcing has become a national dirty word,'' reports National Journal's Congress Daily.
 And it started out so brisk and efficient. Back in 1979, The Journal of the Royal Society of Arts reported an American auto executive's saying, ''We are so short of professional engineers in the motor industry that we are having to outsource design work to Germany.'' But the business practice of contracting with outside suppliers -- especially those outside the United States -- soon brought frowns from labor unions. Business Week noted in 1981 that the ''decline in auto industry jobs . . . will make outsourcing a key issue.'' 
 When a new verb makes it to a gerund so quickly, it's a sign that the word fills a linguistic need. (Outsourcing is the present participle of a verb -- ending in ing -- that is used as a noun, which makes it a gerund, and there'll be a question about that in your exam.) For a generation, as globalization generated about twice as many jobs in the United States as it shipped abroad, the issue was relatively quiescent. But since 2000, when the creation of new jobs began to dip and then further decreased during recession, outsourcing became a favored political target of populists.
 N. Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist and political innocent heading the Council of Economic Advisers, placed himself squarely in the bull's-eye. In his annual report -- 417 dreary pages issued in the president's name that nobody on the White House staff had the good sense to vet -- he noted that ''one facet of increased services trade is the increased use of offshore outsourcing, in which a company relocates labor-intensive service-industry functions to another country.'' He then observed, ''When a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than to make or provide it domestically.'' 
 Though few economists would take issue with this idea first propounded by David Ricardo in 1817, the language seemed deliciously insensitive in a campaign year. Mankiw was forced to apologize: ''My lack of clarity left the wrong impression that I praised the loss of U.S. jobs.''
 Writing on the Web site of the leftist magazine The Nation, the iconoclastic Matt Bivens blurted out the truth: ''The dirty little secret in all of this is that both parties support free trade -- which works roughly as Mankiw describes it. He just wasn't supposed to be so coolly honest about it. It's disconcerting.'' Even more disconcerting to antiprotectionists was another attack gerund, emphasizing the shipment of jobs not just to outside suppliers but also to those in foreign lands: offshoring. 
 Business interests immediately considered a euphemistic counter-attack. A few years ago, in 2001, when legislation was introduced to enable the president to negotiate trade deals without subsequent Congressional modifications, free-traders changed the name of fast track authority, which seemed hasty, to trade promotion authority, a lexical coating that helped the necessary medicine go down.
 The earliest thought along these lines appeared in 1998 in Fleet Owner magazine, noted by the alert Paul McFedries in his Web site, wordspy.com: ''While the traditional model of outsourcing defines the customer and the service provider as two separate systems, the intersourcing model integrates two systems.'' However, the freshly coined intersource, while a perfectly logical extension of the outsource concept, could lend itself to sexual innuendo on late-night television and was hurriedly abandoned. 
 This month, a group calling itself the Coalition for Economic Growth and American Jobs (who could be against that?) decided to oust out from outsourcing, proposing instead worldwide sourcing.
 Within Cegaj, as the coalition has not yet become widely known, worldwide was chosen over global because the adjective global had become too warm -- that is, the noun formed from the adjective's verb, globalization, had acquired a pejorative connotation, in turn casting a pall over the root global itself. The use of world as an attributive noun, however, is still O.K.; that use as a modifier has been long established in World Series, World Cup, World Bank, World Economic Forum, world class, etc. This is despite the fact that the word, as a regular noun, is now eschewed by concerned liberals, who much prefer planet. 
 Forget international. This soporific modifier has been rejected by naming committees not on ideological grounds but because it is too long a word to fit in a one-column headline. It remains in old and revered institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the International House of Pancakes, but is not being used in the newest nomenclature.
 The astute reader (apparently the only kind I have, judging by sustained and gleeful e-mail howling from the Gotcha! Gang) will note the use of source two paragraphs above in its journalistic sense, as ''provider of information.'' 
 In the inexorable trend toward the verbification of nouns, the question asked a generation ago by editors -- ''Do you really have a source for this?'' -- was changed to ''How has this been sourced?'' As if on cue, in galumphed the gerund -- ''You have to be careful about sourcing'' -- and sourcemanship became as good as scholarship. Our use of the gerund (which, you may recall, is a verb ending in ing used as a noun and possesses mysterious syntactical qualities) surely influenced the adoption of outsourcing. 
 In journalese, sourcing means ''getting some living person or historical citation to justify an assertion.'' Viewed from inside an organization, a source can be a despised leaker, traditionally described as ''a disgruntled ex-employee''; viewed from outside, he or she is a courageous whistle-blower. Closing down an overseas bureau and hiring independent ''stringers'' to do the reporting can be considered a specialized form of outsourcing. Basing an article on information gleaned from a journalistic colleague is sometimes called sourcing once removed, but maybe we should take another look at intersource.

HEADLINE: Shape Up, Don't Ship Out 

BYLINE: By Deborah Solomon

 BODY:
Q: As a financial newsman, you have become the country's most outspoken critic of outsourcing, which of course refers to the practice of sending jobs overseas.
 My show has the only list of the companies in the country outsourcing. Now it's over 400 companies. If this is all about satisfying profit targets of a corporation while costing America jobs, then we need to rethink what we are doing in business in this country. If this country isn't working for the middle class, it's not working at all. 
 More globally inclined economists insist that the creation of a middle class in poor countries overseas benefits everyone. And aren't people in India as entitled to jobs as people in America?
 Are you willing to sacrifice 600,000 American jobs and employees to create jobs overseas? I love India. I love the Indian people. But the idea that we can sacrifice an American family to create jobs overseas is insensitive beyond belief. 
 What political party are you registered with?
 I don't want to get into partisan things. 
 You're already in the middle of them. 
 O.K., then here we go. I am a lifelong Republican. I voted for George W. Bush. But right now, I would have to say I'm an Independent. 
 If the election were held tomorrow, whom would you vote for?
 I wouldn't vote for either man. They've got a lot to prove to me. 
 Do C.E.O.'s care about the unemployed? 
 I guess I am still locked up in a time when corporations cared about their employees. 
 I think I have been fortunate enough to work for people who cared.
 But you're hardly a typical employee. I assume your salary is well above a million dollars. 
 I'm well compensated but underpaid. 
 More than a million? 
 If I answer that, do we keep going until you arrive at the precise figure? 
 How many jobs, exactly, has this country lost to outsourcing? 
 A study at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that 14 million jobs are at risk of being lost to outsourcing in the next decade. 
 In your investors' newsletter, you praise companies like Boeing and General Electric for their financial performances, even though you have publicly castigated them on CNN for exporting jobs. Why tell people to invest in companies that outsource? 
 Of course I tell people to invest. That's what a newsletter does. I have not called for anyone to sanction corporations, to boycott them, to send them demerits through the mail. I am trying to enlarge the body of public information. 
 What do you think of the Martha Stewart verdict?
 Obviously, I feel sorry for anyone who has gone through what she has gone through, who has made the mistakes that she made. In the meantime, there are people who have defrauded investors of billions of dollars, and who have cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, who are free. 
 Where's the economy heading? 
 It is set to grow at a reasonable rate for at least the next year. Now, that said, no economists have any idea in the world about when job creation will start or how large it will be. 
 Have you ever wanted to enter politics? Perhaps you can run as someone's vice president. 
 Ralph Nader is out there. There's a thought!
 Actually, you look like a senator. 
 Well, thank you very much. I wouldn't go into politics for any amount of money. I'm not capable of being nice to people who annoy me. Deborah Solomon

THE REAL THING
Truth and Power at the Coca-Cola Company.
By Constance L. Hays.
398 pp. New York:
Random House. $25.95.
 CONSTANCE L. HAYS'S history of Coca-Cola opens with the company's new president, Douglas Ivester, driving to Rome, Ga., an in-house camera crew in tow. It's 1994, and the 108-year-old company is having its greatest year ever. Rome, a hamlet an hour up the road from Coca-Cola's Atlanta headquarters, is known -- at least among Coca-Cola executives -- as the place that consumes more Coke per capita than anyplace else on earth.
 And yet Ivester discovers that even in Coke-saturated Rome, there are dozens of establishments that don't sell Coke! The point of the film that results from Ivester's little excursion (a film shown mainly to Coke employees and Wall Street analysts) is that even though Coke was selling, by then, 310 billion bottles a year, there was still so much to be done -- so many more places that could be selling Coke but weren't. ''It was not just a matter of vanquishing Pepsi-Cola,'' Hays writes. ''It was also about beating back drinks like coffee, tea, milk and water. In flyblown, malnourished parts of Asia and Africa, people still -- inexplicably, if you asked Ivester -- preferred tea or juice to Coca-Cola.'' She adds, ''That the drink was more than a century old and was still not being sold absolutely everywhere hounded Ivester.''
 This is an image that recurs often in ''The Real Thing: Truth and Power at the Coca-Cola Company'': the image of a Coke pooh-bah hounded -- obsessed, actually -- just like Ivester. Here is the founder, Asa Candler, not content with selling Coke in ''the sugar-craving South'' and expanding it all across America. Here's Robert Woodruff, the courtly Southern gentleman who took over the company in 1923 and didn't loosen his grip on power for the next six decades. Woodruff, Hays writes, ''liked knowing that Coca-Cola was the top-selling soft drink in the country. But it was never enough, he told himself and others all the time. Never enough.''
 And here's Roberto Goizueta, the chairman and C.E.O. of Coca-Cola from 1981 until his death in 1997, and one of the book's two central characters. (The other is Donald Keough, who was Goizueta's No. 2 until he was replaced by Ivester.) Hays notes that Goizueta spent enormous sums on international expansion because, he believed, that was where new drinkers would come from. It was not about Coke versus Pepsi, he would explain, echoing Ivester (or was it the other way around?). It was about ''Coke versus people who don't drink Coke yet.''
 The main plotline of ''The Real Thing'' revolves around the successful effort of Goizueta, Keough and Ivester to break the power of the unruly, independent Coca-Cola bottlers -- the people who bought Coke concentrate from the company and then put the final product into retail stores and vending machines. In their place, the three executives formed a handful of giant bottling companies that Coca-Cola completely controlled through stock holdings and board representation. If that sounds less than riveting, well, it is, which is half the problem with this book. The other is that while she's a graceful stylist, Hays, a business reporter for The Times, has written an awkwardly constructed, annoyingly digressive, repetitive book. And she doesn't dwell nearly enough on the far more interesting story that rises naturally from her reporting. That's the one about what happens when smart, driven, ambitious men become so obsessed with growth -- so fueled by the belief that their sweet concoction should be more popular than water -- that they lose touch with reality. That's the real story of the modern Coca-Cola Company.
 During the bull market of the 1980's and 90's, Goizueta managed to persuade the investment community that Coca-Cola was, as Hays nicely puts it, ''a sexy growth company with unlimited prospects despite its having peddled the same product for generations.'' Again and again, he would make the point to Wall Street analysts that there were billions of people who had not yet been converted to Coke -- and the analysts bought into the idea. 
 But it was a mirage. Starting in the mid-1980's, overall sales of both Coke and Pepsi were either flat or declining -- a point Hays notes only in passing. In America, people were gravitating toward noncarbonated drinks; abroad, Coke sales were affected by local economic conditions, currency fluctuations and regional tastes. Yet even in years when Coca-Cola reported small revenue increases, it still managed to generate whopping double-digit profits. In the giddy atmosphere of the bull market, few people bothered to ask how this could be so.
 But they should have. For it turns out that as real growth was slowing, Coca-Cola was ''making its numbers'' by exploiting the big bottling companies that it controlled. It ruthlessly increased the price of Coke concentrate, while insisting on volume targets for the bottlers that were simply unreasonable. What's more, although the bottlers were drowning in debt, the Atlanta company had none of that debt on its own books, because it held under 50 percent of the bottling companies' stock.
 Eventually, the disconnect between the lack of genuine growth and the company's dazzling quarterly numbers had to catch up with it -- and it did, on Ivester's watch. Ivester made plenty of mistakes, but his biggest was his inability to hide the decline in Coke's growth, the way Goizueta always had. By the end of 1999, Ivester was pushed out in a coup orchestrated by two high-profile Coke board members, Herbert Allen, the proprietor of the boutique investment bank Allen & Company, and Warren Buffett.
 Hays treats Goizueta as a heroic figure, and it's easy to see why. He was a man of immense charm and charisma, and Coke still seemed to be running on all cylinders when he died. There is an undercurrent throughout ''The Real Thing'' that if only Goizueta had lived, everything might have turned out all right.
 But the evidence here suggests otherwise. Brilliant businessman though he was, Goizueta had the great good fortune to be running Coca-Cola at a time when high growth was applauded no matter how it was arrived at. He set the company on a path from which it has not yet recovered.
 The most recent proof of this is the announcement in February that Douglas N. Daft, who succeeded Ivester as C.E.O., will retire at the end of this year. He too had failed to turn the ship around. The task won't be any easier for his successor. As it turns out, Coca-Cola is not going to replace water as the world's drink of choice. Not now. Not ever.

HEADLINE: Low Rates Signal Another Round of Refinancing

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
HOMEOWNERS have a second chance at rock-bottom mortgage rates.
 With rates not far above the 45-year lows that were reached briefly last summer, now may be an opportune time to refinance. The average rate on a conventional 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage -- still the most popular home loan -- was 5.38 percent last week, down from 5.41 percent the previous week, according to Freddie Mac, one of the nation's largest sources of mortgage financing. That is less than two-tenths of a percentage point above the low of 5.21 percent last June. Only six weeks ago, rates averaged 5.72 percent. 
 ''We liken the rates to the procrastinator's reward,'' said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm based in Pompton Plains, N.J. ''Rates are probably lower at the moment than they ought to be, based purely on economics.''
 Procrastinators are not the only homeowners who can benefit, Mr. Gumbinger and other mortgage analysts say. The low rates last year eluded many homeowners simply because lenders, appraisers and other mortgage professionals were overwhelmed with applications. 
 Steve and Kelly Bartling of York, Neb., 45 miles west of Lincoln, tried to refinance their ranch-style home last July but had to wait six weeks for an appraisal. ''Then the rates went up, and they stayed up for a really long time,'' said Ms. Bartling, 40, who works in the public affairs office at the University of Nebraska. ''We felt we were the only ones who didn't get in on this really great deal of the century.'' 
 Last weekend, the couple learned that rates were again near the lows of last year. By Wednesday, they had filed the initial paperwork for a 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage at 4.85 percent. The couple is currently paying 6.25 percent on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage -- with 23 years to go.
 Fannie Mae, the large purchaser of home mortgages, estimates that as much as 70 percent of current homeowners could benefit from refinancing at the current low rates. 
 ''A one percentage-point break is enough to consider refinancing,'' Mr. Gumbinger said. But he said there were other considerations. ''The farther along you are in your mortgage,'' he said, ''the less benefit there is in terms of interest cost.'' 
 And sometimes the fees -- which may include services like a title search and could reach up to 2 percent of the value of the loan -- may outweigh the potential savings. 
 ''A good rule of thumb is that the fees should be recouped in two years or so,'' said Marcia Joslyn Sill, an investment adviser in Seattle. She also advised that homeowners check with their current mortgage lenders before refinancing elsewhere, because some will offer a streamlined application with lower fees. ''After all, they already have your information,'' she said. ''It means less paperwork, and it is sometimes also less costly.''
 Refinancing is already picking up. The Mortgage Bankers Association said refinancing activity rose 39.7 percent during the week that ended on March 12, and that refinancing accounted for almost 63 percent of loan applications that week, up from 56 percent the previous week. 
 Bolstered by the low rates, lenders have been raising their projections for the year. Last Monday, the Mortgage Bankers Association predicted that mortgage refinancings would total $1.1 trillion this year, a 57 percent increase from its previous forecast of $700 billion. But some lenders say the increase in refinancing still fails to reflect the current low rates. ''When they were previously at this level, last year, we saw significantly more activity,'' said Doug Perry, a senior vice president at Countrywide Home Loans. ''I don't know if consumers know just how low the rates are. We're almost at all-time lows; we're really close.'' 
 Homeowners' reasons vary for stepping into this round of refinancing. Like the Bartlings, many may simply want to reduce their monthly payments after just missing last year's lowest rates. ''A lot of people who refinanced mortgages last summer did so not at the bottom, but as rates were moving higher,'' so they, too, may benefit from refinancing again, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, a company in North Palm Beach, Fla., that tracks the financial services industry. Mr. McBride noted that after the lows of last summer, rates rose rapidly -- more than 1.2 percentage points in scarcely two months. 
 That quick jump made 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages unaffordable for some prospective homebuyers, Mr. Gumbinger of HSH said. They then tended to choose adjustable-rate mortgages, which have lower interest rates but carry the risk of unexpected increases. ''But now, this borrower can lock up that lower rate for the long term,'' Mr. Gumbinger said. 
 LORI LEVY, 37, the marketing director for a trade group in Washington, got a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, at 6.25 percent, for a two-bedroom townhouse that she bought in Fairfax, Va., in October. But she says she believes that she can do better, saving at least $120 a month by applying for another fixed-rate mortgage or pocketing as much as $400 a month by applying for a certain type of adjustable-rate mortgage, after refinancing fees. ''My payments are manageable at the current rate,'' she said. ''But $120 is $120.'' 
 Those who have lived in their homes for several years may now want to apply for larger mortgages, allowing them to ''cash out'' some of their home equity and use it for home improvements or college expenses. ''We had a big cash-out refinancing boom in 2001, 2002,'' said Orawin Velz, a senior economist at Fannie Mae. ''But whoever did it in 2001 might want to do it again in 2004.'' 
 Some homeowners may want to switch to another type of mortgage. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, spoke in favor of adjustable-rate mortgages this month, saying that many homeowners in 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages were paying too much. Last week, the average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage was 3.39 percent, down from 3.41 percent the week before, according to Freddie Mac. 
 Mr. McBride of Bankrate.com agreed that adjustable mortgages might be better for some homeowners. The 30-year conventional mortgage is ''best for those who are in a home longer than 10 years,'' he said. ''The average homeowner moves every eight years.''

HEADLINE: Ahead by a Tray

BYLINE: By Jonathan Reynolds

 BODY:
The little-known predictive that decides every political race, high or low, has nothing to do with policies, war strategies or economic successes. Every presidential victor since Truman, save one (Nixon -- the exception that proves the rule), has been blessed with it. It's a complex theory substantiated by much sociology, Sunday morning TV tooth-gnashing and several doctoral theses. But narrowed to its marrow, it is known among professional pols as ''the Cafeteria Factor.'' 
 You don't have to be Kevin Phillips to appreciate that the one quality Americans admire most is the same one they resent the most: other people's wealth. Take Michael Bloomberg, both Presidents Bush, Senators Kerry and Edwards and the self-appointed pooh-bah Trump: your average citizen (me included) dreams of, obsesses about or at least pines for being as wealthy as any one of them. At the same time, we luxuriate in their public downfall, on the assumption that they deserve it because they are wealthy. Mayor Bloomberg is, by definition, ''out of touch'' because he is wealthy; H.W. was out of touch because he was so wealthy that he didn't know what a grocery scanner was (despite the fact that most of us yearn to be so out of touch that we never have to know what a grocery scanner is); W. may be in touch, but it's the wrong kind of touch because of his wealth. And the hottest places in public resentment hell are reserved for those who have inherited their wealth, like the Bushes, the Trump and the Kerry. 
 Americans long for money -- but vote for those who don't look as if they've got any: L.B.J., Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Clinton. Hence, the Cafeteria Factor: regardless of fortune, how comfortable would each of the current candidates look sliding a brown, rectangular tray down a stainless-steel track in front of a glassed-in steam table?
 For classic cafeteria ambience, nothing beats Smith's Bar and Restaurant at 44th Street and Eighth Avenue, which has been around forever. It's friendly and loud, with its worn terrazzo floor and walls that have long been a stranger to paint. You get your choice of hot meats and chickens that have been cooking for three or four years, big, fat meat sandwiches and libations from a full bar a few steps away. W. would probably fit in best here, eating lamb shanks as good as any in town with his fingers, slapping the customers on the back and nicknaming all the bartenders. And though it's hard to picture Ralph Nader ever relaxed, at least he would feel guiltless about the prices. The Kerry rectitude might suffer in this jovial, sloppy hangout, which would have tested even Senator Edwards's noted pan-classism.
 Certainly one of the wilder scenes takes place at Veronica's, right in the middle of the Button and Bead District on West 38th Street. It is, believe it or not, an Italian cafeteria featuring all sorts of specialties, from stuffed shells to monkfish francese, and attracts roughly a billion folks at lunchtime. The food shouldn't be confused with Felidia's or Babbo's -- each dish is cooked earlier, then warmed up specially for you in a microwave, which is historically tough on pasta. And someone with glove size XXXXL administers the bread crumbs, so that finding the veg in eggplant parmigiana would try David Kay (but you can't list bread crumbs parmigiana on the menu).
 A fish chowder has plenty of fish; the ravioli peperonata with ''exotic'' mushrooms has a strong and delicious tomato sauce; that ol' oxymoronic jumbo shrimp scampi features shrimp that are indeed jumbo; the chocolate strawberries are leviathan; and the carrot cake, though choked in plastic wrap (seldom an encouraging sign), is moist and sweet. I'd say that W. would do right well here. Kerry could further his antisloganeering position by intoning, '' . . . and don't let the door hit you on the way out, ha ha'' to everyone. But the noise might make Nader retreat further into his shell. It's a festive place. The people in line all seem to be Italian, or at least they inflect with Italian gestures, and they're half the reason to go. To get filled up is the other half. 
 Getting filled up is the only reason to hit the redone cafeteria at the Metropolitan Museum. Despite the much publicized ''theft'' of Jayson Brown, the chef from the Conde Nast cafeteria, it's like eating in England in the 60's -- the best thing on the menu is the bottled water. 
 The place might better be called the Antonym Cafe: the ''wrap'' around the chicken Caesar is too dry and brittle to wrap even the gooiest pudding; the ''crispy onion rings'' are soggy and were possibly never onions; the ''warm'' roasted tomatoes are cold; the Reuben sandwich might as well have come from Lindy's or Joe Franklin's -- too much bread, sparse corned beef, flavor-free Russian. The ''fresh'' antipasto may well have been fresh at some point, but it is surely tired: mushy summer squash, a strange cold roasted potato, limp lettuces, dreadful canned tuna (and I like canned tuna). And as you walk past the glazed eyes of the cashiers into the gloomy, subterranean seating area, you might think seriously about rushing upstairs and eating the art. In fact, the setting and at least one sandwich -- a turkey, St. Andre cheese, pear and cranberry mustard on ciabatta -- upstairs in the American Wing cafe is considerably better, and the view smashing. But I wouldn't send Lyndon LaRouche into the cafeteria.
 Brown's former employer, the Conde Nast cafeteria, which, like the Met's, is orchestrated by Restaurant Associates, serves its clientele considerably more gracefully. All the presidential candidates would be comfortable there, though by scientific method -- sticking my finger in the air -- I'd bet that Kerry would be most welcome in this trendy Frank Gehry space, which fairly screams, ''Anybody but Bush!''
 The food certainly tops that at the Met. (Brown's hiring begins to sound more and more like a variation on ''Br'er Rabbit and the Briar Patch.'') Stations are arrayed at which you can order tailor-made stir-fries, burgers and sandwiches, and there are two large steam tables -- one for domestic fare, one for international (one day filled with New Zealand specialties). The stir-fry consists of a protein, as they call it, many vegetables, rice or noodles and a choice of three sauces (best in show is the Kung Pao) -- extremely satisfying. A chicken soup with real chicken and real cheese tortellini excels. Miracle of miracles, a burger ordered rare actually turns out that way -- a feat most restaurants that aren't cafeterias seldom accomplish. And both the yummy, jammy raspberry pudding and the scrumptious peach crumb pie belong in any self-respecting crib, right next to your copy of ''Goodnight, Moon.''
 The one drawback (well, aside from a bland tuna fish sandwich) is that you can't get in unless you work for Conde Nast or know somebody who does. So this might be the time to wheedle friendships with Trillin, Wintour or Steingarten, even if you're just opportunistically using them for a crack at the Black Forest cupcake.
 The best cafeteria food slides in on a technicality: although the restaurant Cafeteria has no brown trays or stainless tracks, it does have the name. According to its current executive chef, David Honeysett, ''It's basically cafeteria food with better ingredients and an upgraded take on the recipes.'' His individual meatloaves retain the rich meatiness of childhood memory but bring it up to date by adding a tomato relish. The garlic mashed potatoes upon which they rest absorb the flowing relish juices nicely, and the green beans wedged between the two have been quickly braised in butter, oil and chicken stock. Kerry might feel most at home here, as Cafeteria appears to be filled with lots of young'uns in black. 
 Hmm, it appears that all the candidates satisfy the Cafeteria Factor in some way. Probably because of his articulate ability to straddle social strata, Edwards would have fit photogenically into most. Even with a necktie, he gets down more convincingly than Kerry without one. On the other hand, cowboy boots are chic at both Smith's and Buckingham Palace. W. might win a second term simply by putting on and taking off his jacket.

Conde Nast Cafeteria's Raspberry Pudding
(Adapted from danita halt)
2 cups fresh or frozen raspberries
1 cup raspberry jam
2 1/2 cups sifted cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups sugar
8 large egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup milk.
 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix the raspberries with the jam and place in the bottom of a greased 9-inch round cake pan.
 2. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
 3. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter for 30 seconds. Gradually beat in the sugar. Beat on high 3 to 4 minutes, until light and fluffy. Set aside.
 4. In another bowl, beat the egg yolks, vanilla and lemon juice on high until they are thick and pale yellow. Beat into the butter, scraping the sides often. Stir in the flour mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the milk.
 5. Pour the batter over the berries. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out without batter on it, about 40 minutes. (Be careful not to overbake.) Serve warm, so that the center melts a bit when you cut the pudding.
 Yield: 8 servings.

SURPRISE, SECURITY, AND
THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE
By John Lewis Gaddis.
150 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $18.95.
 WHEN President Bush enunciated his national security strategy in September 2002, few Americans outside the foreign policy community paid much attention. When he acted in accord with that strategy by going to war with Iraq without United Nations sanction, more people began to take notice. In this election year, a vigorous public debate on issues related to the Bush policy seems certain. However, in the confusion of a presidential campaign, we cannot be confident that the debate will focus on what is most important.
 John Lewis Gaddis's latest book, ''Surprise, Security, and the American Experience,'' directs attention to the core issues. Based on three lectures delivered at the New York Public Library, this thoughtful volume can help us distinguish polemical chaff from kernels of truth. 
 Gaddis, the Robert A. Lovett professor of history and political science at Yale, points out that three salient elements of the Bush security strategy -- pre-emption, unilateralism and hegemony -- have deep roots in the country's history. When threatened, Americans have typically taken the offensive rather than hide behind a static defense. 
 Following the burning of Washington during the War of 1812, John Quincy Adams, then secretary of state, elaborated policies based on the same three principles that are at the heart of the Bush strategy. For example, he approved Andrew Jackson's invasion of Florida, then a Spanish possession, asserting the right of pre-emption. Unilateralism goes back at least to George Washington's Farewell Address, and Adams solidified the tradition by rejecting an alliance with Britain to keep other European powers out of the Western Hemisphere; he opted instead for a unilateral declaration, the Monroe Doctrine. And he rejected the European balance-of-power doctrine, arguing that the United States must be the predominant power in North America -- in other words, the regional hegemon.
 Gaddis argues that pre-emption, unilateralism and hegemony remained persistent features of American behavior until World War II, when they were modified by Franklin D. Roosevelt. While Roosevelt acted to extend American hegemony beyond the Western Hemisphere, he discarded unilateralism. Rather than going it alone, the United States took the lead in creating a series of multinational institutions. But Roosevelt took this route not in order to subject the United States to the control of others, but to achieve goals the country could not reach alone. ''F.D.R. quietly sought to ensure, in all of these structures, predominance for the United States,'' Gaddis writes. Multilateralism was used to ensure American hegemony, not to undermine it.
 Roosevelt also discarded pre-emption, refusing to approve actions that violated his agreements with Stalin, even though Stalin was reneging on his commitments. Roosevelt, Gaddis believes, felt that if there was to be a war with the Soviet Union, the United States must not fire the first shot. By dividing Europe and establishing an Iron Curtain, Stalin in effect initiated the cold war and ceded the moral high ground to the United States. 
 America's allies were willing to accept United States hegemony throughout these years because the alternatives were worse. American predominance was preferable to losing World War II, or suffering economic collapse when it ended, or living under Soviet domination. In addition, most recognized the moral superiority of American policy. One can argue that the United States emerged from the cold war as the unquestioned global hegemon precisely because it had been willing to mute its traditional unilateral tendencies and to avoid the temptation of preventive war against its principal adversary.
 Gaddis says that the Clinton administration erred in acting as if there were no longer any credible threats to American security. This misperception stemmed from a failure to recognize the implications of two cold war legacies in the international environment: ''the declining authority of the international state system, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.'' 
 While it is clear, as Gaddis suggests, that some modification of Roosevelt's approach is necessary to deal with 21st-century threats, we cannot be confident that the Bush administration's reversion to unilateralism and pre-emption will work. The administration is already finding it difficult to win the peace in Iraq without recourse to the very international institutions that have been weakened by its own actions.
 I would have welcomed more discussion of the difference between hegemony and empire, and between pre-emption and preventive war. At times, Gaddis seems to use the words in each pair interchangeably, but they are distinct concepts, even though it is hard to define precisely at what point one becomes the other. The distinctions are important, for the world and the American taxpayer are much more likely to tolerate a benign American hegemony than a rush to empire, and international law has always considered pre-emption of an immediate threat as legitimate self-defense. A preventive war is a different matter, since its justification rests on the perception, often questionable, of a potential rather than actual threat. 
 When he looks to the future, Gaddis raises more questions than he answers, but he raises the right ones. One of these is whether the administration's domestic policy is consistent with its grand strategy. Gaddis notes the contrast between Roosevelt's call for national sacrifice to win World War II and Bush's decision to place the burden of today's wars only on those who do the fighting -- and on future generations that must pay the bills. One has to wonder whether the administration's fiscal and energy policies are consistent with the goal of maintaining American global predominance.
 Throughout his essays, Gaddis employs a judicious tone and avoids categorical or simplistic answers. He recognizes that the United States faces a different sort of threat from those of the cold war and earlier. Traditional deterrence and balance-of-power policies are inadequate to confront the devil's brew of failed states, rogue regimes, suicidal terrorists and proliferating weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunately, there are no magic potions or certain cures, despite the tendency of both sides in the political debate to pretend that there are.

HEADLINE: CONCERNS RAISED OVER CONSULTANTS TO PENSION FUNDS

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
A small but growing part of the $2 trillion in state and local pension funds is being steered into high-risk investments by pension consultants and others who often have business dealings with the very money managers they recommend. After making such investments, a few of these pension funds have come up short, forcing the governments to draw on tax dollars. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is so concerned that it has begun an inquiry into the practices of pension consultants, who serve as gatekeepers for thousands of money managers.
 The regulators will find not just financial consultants but a web of intermediaries -- marketing agents, lobbyists, brokers and world leaders -- between pension funds and the investments they choose.
 Some play surprising roles. Former President Bill Clinton meets with pension trustees on behalf of the Yucaipa Companies, a private firm that seeks financial returns through social investing. Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister, persuaded the Pennsylvania teachers' pension fund to commit $125 million to SCP Private Equity Partners, a firm that invests in Israeli military technology. New York's former state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, encouraged the Illinois teachers' pension fund to place $20 million in Healthpoint, a private firm that invests in orthopedic devices companies. 
 Some pension consultants play host to gatherings that showcase such famous people to pension officials. Money managers may pay tens of thousands of dollars to participate and often supply the marquee talent. Consultants, meanwhile, are being paid by the pension funds to track and rate the money managers but may take money from the managers for other services.
 Under the consultants' watch, more money is flowing into private or alternative investments, which are not publicly traded like stocks and bonds and whose performance cannot be tracked in any agreed-upon way. Private investment pools attracted virtually no state pension money a decade ago, but the typical state pension fund now has nearly 5 percent of its assets in them, and some states have far more.
 Though such unregulated investments offer the potential for high returns, they carry more risk than conventional stocks and bonds. A few governments have lost money. Richard Holbein, a pension consultant in Dallas, put the Arkansas teachers' pension fund in touch with Andrew S. Fastow, then chief financial officer of Enron, who was pitching investments in one of Enron's off-balance-sheet entities. Arkansas committed $30 million and may have lost it all.
 Another of Mr. Holbein's clients, the Louisiana teachers' pension fund, committed an unusually large part of its portfolio to private equities and other alternative investments at his recommendation. Because of recent losses, Louisiana and its taxpayers must contribute $589 million to the pension fund -- $147 million more than last year. 
 Louisiana fund officials and Mr. Holbein say that private equity tends to be a volatile investment with unexpected swings from year to year, but the overall approach remains sound and does not present a long-term problem for the fund.
 In other cases, pension money is landing in investments that deduct big fees. Some of the costs may not be clearly disclosed, and some may be wholly unnecessary.
 The Chicago teachers' pension fund was about to commit $35 million to a Boston real estate partnership last December when one official noticed that nearly 2 percent of the money would go to the consulting firm of Edward M. Kennedy Jr., the senator's son, which the real estate developer had retained to market the investments. Normally, pension funds are not billed for marketing fees. The teachers' fund refused to pay and was permitted to invest anyway.
 Specialists say the structure of public pension funds leaves them particularly vulnerable. Fund boards are responsible for investing hundreds of millions of dollars, but only the biggest ones can afford professional investment staffs. Public trustees are often drawn from the ranks of firefighters, teachers and other public employees whose retirements they are protecting. They often have little financial training and are expected to serve as volunteers. Most public funds therefore rely heavily on consultants, even though the consultants may have business ties with the very money managers they are supposed to help select.
 ''In my opinion, there is a mismatch,'' said Brian N. Minturn, who was fired last year by the Louisiana teachers' pension fund. He said he was dismissed after he raised concerns that the prominent Dallas investment firm of Hicks, Muse Tate & Furst was plying the trustees and their consultants with food and drink, and taking them on golf excursions, hunting trips and other outings that he thought distracted them from their fiduciary duty to vet investments prudently. An ethics panel ultimately found that some pension officials, Mr. Holbein and Hicks, Muse had violated state ethics laws.
 ''On the side of the pension fund, you may have food-service workers on $35,000 a year, and they never get to do any of this kind of stuff,'' he said. ''And on the side of the alternative investments, there is very high-powered talent, and very strong motivations, to go out and get whatever you can.''
 What the investment community wants, of course, is big blocks of money.
 ''If you look at where the money is, it's kind of what Willie Sutton said about why he robbed banks,'' said Mr. Minturn, who once worked for Fidelity Investments and the Invesco funds. ''Pension funds are just these huge piles of money.'' 
 Consultants and many pension fund officials say that they are not being swayed by business relationships, and that private equities are an important tool in their portfolios, when used in moderation. 
 ''Our board does believe in diversifying our portfolio into some active investments that are riskier,'' said Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for the California state employees' pension fund, known as Calpers. ''They do it to add value to the fund.'' In some cases, pension officials say they also choose alternative investments to achieve other goals, like local development.
 Mr. Minturn and some other concerned pension specialists said they had no objection to private investment partnerships per se, but questioned the appropriateness of investing public pension money in them. Because the assets are not publicly traded, they cannot be sold quickly to raise cash; they have no listed price, and their performance cannot be tracked or evaluated in conventional ways. They also involve fees much larger than those for publicly traded stocks or simpler investments. They sometimes generate large profits, but not always, and the partnerships are usually structured so that the outside investors -- like pension funds -- bear most of the risk.
 A few states and municipalities bar pension funds from investing in private equities. Most states limit these investments to a small share of their portfolios. Data compiled by Wilshire Associates, the investment advisory company, suggests that the average state pension fund had 4.7 percent of its assets in private equities last year. 
 By Wilshire's count, the Louisiana teachers' pension fund had 18 percent of its portfolio in such investments last year. But when its total commitment over time to various private partnerships is calculated -- and the state cannot really back out of these pledges -- Louisiana had at one point committed 42 percent of its assets to what it calls ''alternative investments,'' according to state pension plan documents. 
 Mr. Holbein said that Louisiana's investment problems were unforeseeable. Though some individual private equity funds may falter, he said he believed that they could produce higher returns than publicly traded stocks on the whole. He advocated a high level of alternative investments for Louisiana, he said, because a state law requires the teachers' pension fund to accumulate money quickly to reach full funding. More conservative investments will not provide adequate gains, he said.
 In December, the S.E.C. sent 12-page letters to about two dozen pension consultants, requesting extensive information about what they do for pension funds, how they are paid and how their pension work may conflict with their other business operations. The agency appears to be trying to learn how often pension consultants work for both sides of the table, receiving compensation from their pension clients and money managers. Lori A. Richards, director of the commission's inspections unit, said the study was still in progress and the commission had not drawn any conclusions.
 Pension consultants sort money managers into asset classes and build databases using their own criteria to help trustees compare and select managers. Some consultants also sell their databases and tracking software to money managers and even sell advice on how to achieve higher rankings.
 A 2002 audit of Hawaii's pension fund found that its consultant, Callan Associates, had recommended 16 money managers over time -- and 14 of them were paying Callan for marketing advice and other services. ''The consultant's objectivity could be suspect,'' said the state auditor, Marion M. Higa, calling for further scrutiny. She noted that the Hawaii fund's overall five-year investment performance ''ranks in the bottom 5 to 15 percent nationwide.'' 
 A Callan spokeswoman said that Hawaii's trustees stood by Callan after the audit, issuing a statement calling it ''a highly regarded investment advisory firm with an unblemished reputation for integrity.'' In a statement, Callan said that it kept its various business lines separate and that it told all money managers that they would not win preferential treatment from Callan's pension consultants by buying other Callan services.
 Early this year, Wilshire Associates took steps to make its pension consulting work more independent of its other lines of business, and the leader of its consulting and asset-management units left the firm. ''Wilshire has never participated in 'pay to play,' '' a spokeswoman said.
 Many consultants hold educational conferences for pension trustees. The trustees pay a modest admission fee or none at all; the costs are borne by money managers, who pay tens of thousands of dollars for the chance to attend and meet the trustees. The more they pay, the more influence they tend to have over content and the more access to trustees, from leading workshops to closer seating assignments.
 CRA RogersCasey, a consulting firm, charges money managers $35,000 to $40,000 to send two representatives to its gatherings, which take place at resorts and in the past have featured speakers like retired Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf; Colin L. Powell, now the secretary of state; and Mary Matalin, the Republican political strategist. 
 Mercer Investment Consulting, a large firm that is a unit of the Marsh & McLennan Companies, charges money managers $35,000 to $58,000 a year to attend its conferences. This month, Mercer sent a letter to its clients, telling them it had complied fully with the S.E.C.'s request for information and outlining its other business activities, like software sales and investment conferences.
 ''Making these products and services available to the broader investment community does not in any way impact our objectivity,'' the letter said.
 Bill Clinton addressed at least two public trustees' conferences last year and was well received, said Jack Silver, a former trustee of the Chicago teachers' pension fund who attended both. Mr. Silver has been an outspoken critic of the undisclosed business relationships of pension intermediaries, but he said Mr. Clinton made useful remarks about the economy -- not a sales pitch -- and that the trustees benefited from his appearance. So, he added, did Mr. Clinton's sponsor, Yucaipa. ''It's marketing,'' Mr. Silver said. ''When you have somebody like him, people remember.'' 
 Yucaipa's managing partner, Ronald W. Burkle, is a billionaire and has been a substantial donor to many politicians, including Mr. Clinton and several past and present trustees of Calpers. In 2001, Calpers voted to commit $450 million to three Yucaipa private investment funds, which are designed to generate returns and societal benefits, by financing neglected businesses in poor neighborhoods and companies that treat workers conscientiously. Calpers' most recent annual report showed that these funds have drawn about $51 million in total investments and related fees, and have so far not produced returns. 
 A Calpers spokesman said that private investment funds routinely draw on the partners' capital in the first few years, and pay returns only later. He also said the commitment to Yucaipa's funds is only a small part of Calpers's $164 billion portfolio. Yucaipa said its fledgling investments were poised to bear fruit, but it could not provide additional information last week.
 Some pension officials say they find the out-of-office politicians useful liaisons. Jon Bauman, the executive director of the Illinois teachers' pension fund, said his board had been considering an investment in Healthpoint when Mr. McCall became vice chairman. His arrival ''added to a favorable opinion,'' Mr. Bauman said.

HEADLINE: Incognito, Polyester Boogies Onto the Playing Field

BYLINE: By ROBERT JOHNSON

 BODY:
FROM baseball players at spring training to Tiger Woods on the golf course and Andy Roddick on the tennis court, more professional athletes are showing up in uniforms and activewear made from a trendy, fast-drying fabric. It is satiny smooth and sleek -- but it is not a new strain of Pima cotton, or a blend of baby alpaca and cashmere.
 So what is this mystery fabric? Try polyester. Yes, a lightweight, paper-thin version of the leisure-suit material may be the hottest thing in sports clothing. 
 Well, maybe the coolest and driest thing. ''The performance clothing giants have worked with polyester to beat the old disco double-knit image,'' said Neil Schwartz, director of marketing at Sports Scan Info, a consumer research firm in West Palm Beach, Fla.
 Polyester's acceptance and spreading influence in the $5 billion sports clothing industry are being driven largely by Under Armour Performance Apparel, started in 1995 and based in Baltimore. The company registered sales of $120 million in 2003, a total that encompasses polyester shirts, shorts and other clothing like outerwear and underwear.
 Kevin Plank, Under Armour's founder and president, said: ''Cotton is our target. Seven out of 10 people working out at the gym or playing on the golf course are still wearing cotton. Polyester is a tough sell to people who remember 'Saturday Night Fever,' but more and more of them are giving us a try.''
 Cotton still has a 70 percent market share of the fabric used in activewear, but its grip is increasingly shaky. 
 Global supplies of cotton have fallen recently because of droughts in China and Australia, which are major growers. ''Cotton was already in a technological war with polyester in sportswear to offer the best feel and fit for people playing sports and exercising,'' said Blake Brown, a professor of agricultural economics at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, in the heart of the American textile industry. ''When you're in a war, the last thing you want is an interruption in your supply lines.''
 Not surprisingly, established sports clothing brands like Nike, Adidas and Reebok, influenced by competition from upstarts like Under Armour and by the high price of cotton, are introducing their own polyester apparel.
 Makers of other brands -- including Dockers from Levi Strauss and Tehama, which is endorsed by Clint Eastwood -- are allowing higher percentages of polyester into some of their clothes, permitting faster drying and enabling the manufacturers to control costs. There is ample incentive to use the cheaper fabric and to promote its advantages: the wholesale price of cotton has risen 52 percent in the last year, and polyester is now just one-fourth its price. 
 ''Everyone wants to hold the line on prices in this economy'' and to emphasize the high-technology qualities of their fabrics, said David Hagler, director of apparel for Nike Golf, whose Dri Fit line includes $60 polo shirts that are 92 percent polyester and 8 percent spandex.
 ''We're adding value with manmade materials that dry faster when being worn so they feel comfortable longer,'' Mr. Hagler said. ''And now we're moving beyond dry into garments that offer more wind protection, added stretch to improve athletic performance, and they hold their colors and shape better.''
 Usually, consumers do not see polyester mentioned in an advertisement. Instead, clothiers use terms like technical fabric, microfiber and moisture management system. The repackaging of polyester is essential to its new success, said Lynn Kahle, a professor of marketing at the University of Oregon who does research in consumer psychology. ''In fashion, quality is sometimes an ambiguous concept,'' he said. 
 THE improved image of polyester is swaying some sportswear companies to make their cotton garments resemble, of all things, polyester. 
 One production technique that has been promoted in high-end cotton golf shirts is called mercerizing. That means soaking the cotton in a chemical finish and then treating it with a solution of caustic soda while it is being stretched -- a process that swells the fibers and makes the fabric so smooth and shiny that it resembles polyester.
 Many labels are noting that the garments have been mercerized -- not once, as was sometimes done in the past, but two or three times.
 ''Mercerization gives cotton a shine once synonymous with cheapness and manmade materials,'' acknowledged Rick Hendee, vice president for marketing at Cotton Inc., a trade group based in New York. He made no apologies. ''Cotton had to learn to be versatile,'' he said. ''We have to adapt and be tenacious.''
 That is something polyester has done. It was born in 1929 in the laboratory of the DuPont chemist W.H. Carothers, who concocted it from chemicals found mainly in petroleum. With certain variations in the formula, it is used in the making of fibers, films and plastics. The first Dacron-brand polyester suits emerged in the 1950's and were advertised as being made of a miracle fiber that could be worn for 68 days without ironing and still look presentable.
 Polyester was so popular and inexpensive to make that small textile mills, many in former gas stations, emerged all over the country. But much of the fiber that was produced was of such low quality that polyester gained a reputation as cheap and uncomfortable. The fall was hastened by Johnny Carson, who noted sarcastically in his talk-show monologue that polyester was also used to make soft-drink bottles.
 The marketing of polyester today as a technical fabric appeals to many people's shopping instincts. ''The polyester marketers are getting a response by reaching out to mankind's intuitive desire for something new and sort of digital,'' said Teri Schleifer, vice president for merchandising at Fairway & Greene, a golfwear maker in Shelton, Conn.
 But Ms. Schleifer is a cotton loyalist. ''Our company is founded on clothes with a traditional look and feel,'' she said. ''We'll never change. We have never made a polyester shirt and never will.''
 The Fairway & Greene brand is sold only in country clubs and golf resort shops, where the shirts are priced at $70 to $80. Ms. Schliefer acknowledged that she might lose some sales to clothes that are at least part polyester during the synthetic fabric's current resurrection. ''But I think a lot of those customers will come back in the long run,'' she said. ''Cotton clothing is thousands of years old. It's proven, and I don't think it's going away.''

HEADLINE: Is the Aerospace Industry Ready for Mars?

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ and MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
CAN they do it?
 When President Bush announced a plan early this year to send Americans back to the moon -- and beyond, to Mars -- skeptics wondered whether NASA, with its decades of tread-water budgets and institutional inertia, was up to the job.
 Equally important, though, is a companion question: Is the aerospace industry up to the job? Boeing, for one, says it is eager to take up the challenge, and refers to decades of expertise in running enormously complex space ventures.
 But the very process that made it the biggest NASA contractor -- a sweeping consolidation of the aerospace industry -- has sharply reduced competition, and with it, critics say, the creative clash of ideas that helps produce great technological leaps. 
 Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other companies that contribute to the space program are the stewards of an ailing industry, facing a brain drain as its aging engineers retire, with few newcomers entering the field. 
 The uncertainty has been underscored recently. Since Mr. Bush made his initial announcement, which was greeted with some public skepticism, he has been largely silent on the subject, not even mentioning it in his State of the Union address.
 ''Is the nation really going to support, given the budget deficit, spending more money on a manned mission?'' asked Cai von Rumohr, an aerospace analyst at SG Cowan. Given all the unknowns, he said, trying to estimate the impact on particular companies is not even worth the effort. ''You're talking lots of dollars, a long-term horizon, an unclear political mandate,'' he said. ''There's still lots of 'ifs.''' 
 For Boeing, any rewards in Mr. Bush's vision are especially vague, said Prof. Charles Hill at the University of Washington in Seattle, who has studied the company for years and calls himself ''extremely skeptical.'' 
 If space exploration proceeds, of course, Boeing stands to benefit tremendously. The company has absorbed the military and aerospace units of Rockwell, builder of the space shuttle; Rocketdyne, a Rockwell unit that built the main shuttle engines; and McDonnell Douglas, builder of some shuttle components. 
 Though any missions to the moon or to Mars would be ''strategically important'' to Boeing in its attempts to broaden beyond commercial aviation and military work, it has pressing issues to deal with now, Professor Hill added. 
 Last year, Airbus surpassed it in commercial aviation sales. Last month, the government canceled its longstanding development work on the Comanche helicopter. The company also said that it would curb production of its 767 tanker plane because of the Pentagon's review of whether Boeing acted improperly by hiring a former military official. In 2003, the space unit of Boeing lost nearly $1.8 billion on $3 billion in revenue. 
 Though a Mars mission could be lucrative, it would not lift Boeing out of its current trough, Professor Hill said. ''It is so far out in the future,'' he said. 
 Still, John M. Lounge, a former astronaut who is director of program development for Boeing NASA Systems in Houston, said he was energized by the prospect of President Bush's proposal. ''I was afraid we were on a 'going out of business' plan for American human space flight,'' he said.
 Mike Mott, a Boeing vice president and general manager for its NASA systems, said the company was up to the task. ''The complexity of developing, integrating and operating the dozens, if not hundreds, of robotic, human and telerobotic systems it will take to launch, assemble, transfer, land and build permanent habitats on the moon and Mars far exceeds anything we have ever attempted to do in space,'' he testified on March 5 before the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy. ''But we have been building vehicles in space for a fairly long time. We know how to do that part of it. We have been integrating very large, complex, adaptable, long-term systems. So we know how to do that, as well.''
 BUT those who have studied today's space program and NASA's relationships with its biggest contractors have misgivings.
 For one thing, technical skill is slipping away as the generations of engineers who gave the nation the Apollo and shuttle programs have been laid off or have retired. The aerospace industry has shrunk by half since its peak of 1.3 million workers in 1989. Some 27 percent of those remaining will probably retire by 2008, according to the Aerospace Industries Association; three-quarters of NASA's technicians are over 60.
 When NASA needed to build a new shuttle after the Challenger disaster in 1986, companies like McDonnell Douglas had to bring engineers out of retirement, said Randy Jayne, a former aerospace executive who is now a senior partner at Heidrick & Struggles International, the executive search firm. Now, he said, with retired engineers even older, rehiring them ''is less realistic as an option.'' 
 And their expertise is not being replenished. Bright engineering students are now more likely to go into areas like the Internet or biotechnology. Once the ''industry of choice'' for technical workers, aerospace ''presents a negative image to potential employees,'' the industry association said. A survey of 500 American aerospace workers found that 80 percent would not recommend that their children follow them into the field.
 Consolidation has hurt, too. Pulling rivals into a big tent can create a ''more comfortable atmosphere'' for corporate management, according to a study by the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in 2002, but over time it drains the industry of competition -- the lifeblood of innovation -- and ''leads unavoidably to stagnation.'' 
 Reduced financing causes a further squeeze, the report said. Companies shifted their focus from the space business, which has thin profit margins and is subject to the capriciousness of politics, making even the commercial jet business seem reliable by comparison.
 Private industry has always had a role in the space program, but that role has expanded so much that the final report on last year's Columbia disaster concluded that the space agency had given too much authority to contractors like the United Space Alliance, which is owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. An appendix to the report recommended something that could be seen as heretical: looking to new companies for support in future contracts. 
 NASA is not the only government agency with complex projects and risky goals, the report said: ''The Department of Energy solicits competitive bids for management and operating contracts, with the result that nationally known construction firms, component manufacturers, nonprofit institutions, universities and even aerospace firms regularly vie for the work at a fraction of the fee NASA pays for these services. If they can design nuclear weapons and naval nuclear propulsion plants for the Department of Energy, why cannot NASA overcome its attachment to the aerospace industry to seek management and operating support from a broader base?''
 John M. Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a member of the commission that investigated the Columbia accident, said he found such conclusions ''narrow minded.'' But he agreed that the relationships between NASA and its contractors needed to be revitalized.
 The grand challenge of missions to the moon and to Mars, he said, may be just the thing to breathe new life into those programs. ''What this vision does is provide a focus, not only for revitalization of NASA, but the revitalization of the U.S. civil space capability,'' he said, ''including the industrial base, including academia.''
 MR. LOUNGE of Boeing said the important thing was to keep exploring. ''This isn't a project that takes 5 or 10 years or even 20 years,'' he said. ''This is a 100-year activity. This is something we choose to do because it's fundamental to our nature to explore.''
 More than contracts or politics, space flight is about wonder, Mr. Lounge said. As an astronaut, he recalled having little free time during missions to think about the larger aspects of space flight. But before he went to sleep, he said, ''my nose was against the window looking out, saying, 'Oh my God, can you believe it?'''

HEADLINE: Managing The Deficit With Plans To Spend

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
FOR the most concise description of how fiscal self-restraint has changed in the last decade, look no further than the bill adopted last week by the House Budget Committee.
 Strongly supported by President Bush, the bill would technically reinstate what was originally called the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. As modified in 1990, when the first President Bush reluctantly broke his no-new-taxes pledge, the law required that Congress offset the cost of new spending and new tax cuts with savings in other areas.
 But the House bill makes one basic switch: where the old law attacked measures that would lead to a ''net deficit increase,'' the new one attacks measures that lead to ''an increase in direct spending.'' 
 Put another way, the prime concern is not a balanced budget. It is growth in government spending. Unlike the ''pay as you go'' rules of the 1990's, Congress would not have to offset the costs of new tax cuts.
 The distinction is central in the battle over the current President Bush's economic agenda, because tax cuts are likely to be the biggest new contributor by far to federal budget deficits over the next decade.
 Mr. Bush's top economic priority is to extend permanently most of the tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2003, along with other expiring provisions like the tax credit for research and development. The cost of extending the tax breaks would be about $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
 The administration, along with lawmakers in both parties, also wants to overhaul the alternative minimum tax, a part of the law that was created to prevent rich taxpayers from taking too much advantage of tax breaks. The A.M.T. is not adjusted for inflation, and it is expected to ensnarl 31.6 million taxpayers by 2010 and saddle them with tax increases.
 But fixing that tax is expected to cost the Treasury at least $400 billion between now and 2014. Adding the interest expense from borrowing the money to pay for all that tax relief would lead to a total drain on the Treasury of nearly $2 trillion through 2014.
 Tax cuts are not the only thing that Republicans would keep off the table as they try to reduce the deficit. Though Mr. Bush and the House Republicans would impose ''pay as you go'' rules for any expansion in federal entitlements, those restrictions would not apply to the new Medicare prescription drug legislation, signed into law last December, that could cost $534 billion over the next 10 years and as much as $2 trillion in the decade after that.
 Nor would the new budget controls make it harder for Congress to pass big supplemental spending for the war in Iraq or for national security.
 At first blush, the House bill appears to impose a surprisingly tight leash on the Bush administration's ability to justify big increases in emergency responses. The bill warns that an emergency must be something ''sudden'' and ''unforeseen'' as well as something temporary, not permanent.
 That would almost seem to raise questions about future spending in Iraq, which Mr. Bush's critics could argue is increasingly less temporary and more foreseeable. But Republican Congressional aides said last week that the language would impose no obstacles for future spending in Iraq, adding that the White House was comfortable with the wording.
 If the full House of Representatives passes the budget bill, it will be on a collision course with the Senate, which passed a budget resolution this month that would require a 60-vote majority to make President Bush's tax cuts permanent.
 The Senate provision was adopted over the opposition of the Senate's Republican majority, after four Republicans broke ranks and voted with Democrats.
 IF Mr. Bush and Republican Congressional leaders prevail, the burden of reducing the federal budget deficit will fall primarily on domestic discretionary programs -- housing vouchers for low-income families and public housing, grants to local police and fire departments and block grants for child care assistance.
 Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, contends that the House Budget Committee's blueprint would cut domestic discretionary spending by $120 billion below the levels needed to keep up with inflation. If true, those would amount to very deep cuts through 2009. But domestic discretionary programs account for only about 17 percent of the federal budget. Even if Mr. Bush gets everything he wants, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that federal spending would climb to $2.7 trillion in 2009 from $2.3 trillion in 2004.
 All of which makes one wonder: Do Republicans have a secret plan to keep the government big?

HEADLINE: For Mustang Owners, the First Love Is the Sweetest

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
LOVE at first sight is not something that happens only between people. In 1964, tens of thousands of car buyers were swept off their feet by the alluring shape of a sporty new Ford called the Mustang; four decades later, many of those relationships endure. 
 Harrel McKinney of Montgomery, Ala., was one of those whose heart was stolen, falling hard for a Wimbledon White coupe with a 260-cubic-inch V-8. In his case, there was not even a car in the first glimpse -- just a picture in the dealer's showroom. 
 ''I almost bought a Rambler Ambassador,'' Mr. McKinney said. ''But then I visited a Ford dealer and saw the new Mustang in a brochure. When I stopped salivating all over myself I ordered one on the spot.'' 
 That Mustang was his daily transportation for many years, but since being restored in 1990 it leads a pampered life of parades and car shows, sharing garage space with a 1965 convertible that Mr. McKinney bought in 1990. Mr. McKinney's object of affection originally cost $2,440, and he remains faithful despite the car's rise in value over the years. ''I wouldn't sell my original car for anything,'' he said.
 Wanda Whitsell, of Springfield, Va., who calls her Nightmist Blue '66 coupe ''the little car,'' clearly recalls where she first saw a Mustang: on a turntable at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. ''I stood there with my mouth open and told my husband I had to have one,'' Mrs. Whitsell said. ''I begged him until late 1965, when he finally surrendered and gave it to me for Christmas.'' 
 The Mustang was restored by Mrs. Whitsell and her husband, Arley, in 1991, and she is often approached by people offering to buy the car, which has been driven 149,000 miles. ''Let's just say that a lot of people are real nice to me,'' Mrs. Whitsell said.
 The marketing bull's-eye scored by the Ford Mustang in 1964 would be nearly impossible to repeat today. A perfect storm of prosperous times, population trends (the children of the baby boom were reaching driving age) and accurate market research combined to sell the youthful two-door in record numbers.
 The public relations campaign to introduce the car was as ambitious as the car's styling. In the fall of 1963, Ford brought journalists to the company's Dearborn, Mich., headquarters for seminars with Lee A. Iacocca, the general manager of the Ford division, on the new youth market that the Mustang would serve. The press introduction, on April 17, 1964, was timed to coincide with the opening of Ford's pavilion at the World's Fair. 
 The public's appetite had been whetted by the Mustang I show car, a roadster with a 109-horsepower V-4 engine. The clamor inspired Ford to move ahead with the Mustang II, a 1962 design study that closely resembled the car that Ford eventually sold.
 Mr. Iacocca bet his career (and $65 million of Ford's money) on the Mustang, which borrowed its chassis, engines and suspension from the Falcon, a modest economy car. But the Mustang's fresh styling and youth appeal was something entirely new. 
 For $2,368 the buyer of the 1965 Mustang (the ''1964 1/2'' designation was never official) got a two-door hardtop with a 170 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine and a floor-mounted three-speed manual transmission. Customers could also order V-8's with up to 271 horsepower. 
 The '65 Mustang was an unqualified hit, sales reaching 680,989 for the 17-month 1965 model year and 607,568 for 1966. That success prodded General Motors and Chrysler to respond with competitors using the same long-hood, short-deck formula, creating a new class known as ''pony cars.'' 
 A minor restyling for 1967 represented an evolution of the original design. It was around this time that 15-year-old Laurie Slawson began begging her father, a national lease manager for Ford, for a Mustang. Now 51 and an archaeologist in Tucson, she still owns ''Murphy,'' a 1968 coupe powered by the 289 cubic-inch V-8. 
 Styling was revised again for the 1969 models, growing in size and shifting to a four-headlight design. Engine options extended to the brutally powerful Boss 429 that year, but it was a six-cylinder fastback model that proved irresistibly attractive to Per Berglund, 35, of Sweden, who paid $3,600 for one in 1988. 
 Mr. Berglund has invested another $30,000 in the car, restoring the rusted body panels and replacing the anemic engine with a 450-horsepower V-8. Mr. Berglund is not the only Mustang lover in Scandinavia -- there are about 1,400 of Ford's pony cars registered in Sweden's Classic Mustang Club.
 A restyling for the 1971 model year took Mustang in a new direction, one that many collectors feel abandoned the car's distinctive look. With the arrival of the Mustang II in 1974 -- a car based on the Pinto -- the pony car attributes that had fostered loyaly to the early Mustangs were all but gone. The passion was renewed in 1979 with a redesigned model that revived the Mustang's performance image. 
 Dave Marchand, coordinator of the Mustang/Thunderbird Club Center at Ford, estimates that there are 30,000 members involved in some 250 different Mustang clubs worldwide. There is even a Yellow Mustang Registry that caters to -- you guessed it -- 2,950 yellow Mustangs.
 The celebrations are also igniting an old debate: Which Mustang was the first produced? Logically, the honor belongs to a white GT convertible, serial number 5F08F100001, originally sold to a Canadian airline pilot but now in the collection of the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn.
 The second production car, 5F07U100002, a Caspian Blue hardtop, is owned by Bob Fria of La Crescenta, Calif. Mr. Fria says he thinks his car may have been built before the convertible, but haphazard record keeping makes that nearly impossible to prove. Mr. Fria says one thing is certain, though: his very early Mustang is worth ''six figures.''

HEADLINE: As Europe Hunts for Terrorists, The Hunted Press Advantages

BYLINE: This article was reported and written by Tim Golden, Desmond Butler and Don Van Natta Jr.; Tim Golden reported from Madrid, Desmond Butler from Germany and Don Van Natta Jr. from London. Jason Horowitz contributed reporting from Italy.

DATELINE: MADRID, March 21 

 BODY:
On a quiet Sunday afternoon, the ancient Madrid neighborhood of Lavapies is a picture of European multiculturalism.
 Spanish matrons with sprayed helmets of golden hair stroll arm in arm with husbands wearing black berets. A young man with a purple mohawk sips coffee after coffee. Nearby, a few Nigerians lean against a wall, telling stories of the night before. Young Moroccans drift buoyantly down the street.
 On several nights last week, however, the neighborhood that has long been a haven for Muslim immigrants looked more like a battleground. The police raided Moroccan-owned shops for evidence in the Madrid terror bombings. Investigators hunted witnesses. Handcuffed suspects, hooded with garbage bags, were hustled into waiting cars. 
 The battle that broke into the open in Lavapies is being fought in shadows all over Europe, as the police and intelligence agents confront the growing numbers of Islamic militants who blend easily with other immigrants from North Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere.
 The unfolding Spanish investigation has shown that the terrorists continue to exploit a tactical advantage. The militants operate in an ever-changing constellation of cells, moving freely from country to country across the continent, guided by opportunity and fanaticism. The agents tracking them are constrained by jurisdictional and bureaucratic boundaries. Intelligence is far too infrequently shared, investigators say, often leaving information about dangerous militants woefully incomplete.
 ''There is an enormous amount of information, but much of it gets lost because of the failures of cooperation,'' Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigative judge, said in an interview. ''We are doing maybe one-third of what we can do within the law in fighting terrorism in Europe. There is a lack of communication, a lack of coordination, and a lack of any broad vision.''
 At least three of the suspects in the Madrid attacks were known to European and Arab intelligence officials for some time. One suspect, a 30-year-old Moroccan named Jamal Zougam, raised suspicions in Spain, Morocco and France, consorted with militant leaders from at least five countries and had his home searched by the police, yet was never thoroughly investigated. He has denied any involvement in the bombings.
 Mr. Zougam's ability to maneuver on the fringes of scrutiny was hardly unique. Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, another young Moroccan named Mohamed Daki, who was living in Germany, acknowledged to the police that he knew members of the Hamburg cell that planned the attacks. But the authorities did not track him. He resurfaced last April near Milan, where the Italian authorities charged him with conspiring to recruit terrorists to fight against Americans in Iraq.
 In the span of barely two decades, Europe has gone from being a refuge for Arab radicals, to a staging ground for terrorist attacks elsewhere, to a prized target for Islamic terrorists. Between the Sept. 11 attacks and the Madrid bombings, the European authorities say they thwarted a string of plots -- the European Parliament building, the American Embassies in Paris and Rome, the 13th-century cathedral of Strasbourg, France. But in recent months, senior intelligence officials worried openly that it was only a matter of time before terrorists struck a major European city.
 The Madrid bombings, which killed 202 people and wounded 1,700, suggested that terrorists linked to Al Qaeda could not only modify their tactics, but also adopt a mind-set different from the one investigators thought they knew. 
 Suicide bombers were replaced by triggering devices engineered with cheap cellphones. While disciples of Osama bin Laden are known for favoring symbolism in their targets, these plotters seemed more political. The Madrid attackers struck just three days before the Spanish elections, which dislodged a government that supported the American-led invasion of Iraq. When Mr. Zougam arrived in court after five days incommunicado, he reportedly asked the clerks, ''Who won the elections?''
 The tactical shift that seemed to concern intelligence officials most was the silence of the terrorists. Officials noted an eerie absence of the communications ''chatter'' usually detected in the days before and after attacks.
 ''It was the quiet that was so odd,'' one intelligence official said. ''It was so quiet, so quiet. We haven't seen that before.''

The Seeds of Jihad
Militant Clerics, Restless Youths
 Fifteen years ago, the call for jihad first echoed in the most militant of mosques in London, Hamburg and Madrid.
 Fiery imams, like Sheik Abu Hamza al-Masri of the Finsbury Park mosque in a rundown north London neighborhood, found a ready audience. Mostly they were restless Muslim youths, whose families had streamed into Europe seeking asylum from persecution in their home countries, but who wound up embittered by the struggle for economic opportunity. In some young people, the seeds of a war on the West took root, and thousands traveled to Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan where they learned to fire weapons and use explosives.
 While European intelligence agencies focused more on domestic terrorism -- the I.R.A. in Britain, the Basque group ETA in Spain -- Europe became a fertile recruiting ground for Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda.
 ''Al Qaeda's European infrastructure has always been far more ingrained and widespread than their presence in North America,'' said Matthew A. Levitt, a senior fellow in terrorism studies at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
 Eventually, Europe became a staging area for terrorism -- most notably the Sept. 11 attacks, planned in Germany and Spain. Afterward, as the Europeans swept up hundreds of suspected terrorists, intelligence officials began to fear attacks on their own soil. Initially, intelligence agencies showed an unusual cooperation in defusing several plots.
 As pressure on Al Qaeda's leadership mounted, the militants adapted. Radical imams took their message underground. Muslim extremists appeared to regroup into smaller, more transient cells, intelligence officials say, with fewer discernible ties to the Qaeda hierarchy.
 New groups emerged and new associations developed among established ones. In recent months, officials say, Ansar al Islam, the militant group that was entrenched in northern Iraq before the war, has reasserted itself in Europe, recruiting operatives to fight in Iraq. The officials say the move reflects an alliance forged between Ansar and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a bin Laden confederate who American officials say is behind a recent series of deadly bombings in Iraq.
 ''As Al Qaeda's superstructure was taken down, one option was to press in new directions, put resources somewhere else,'' said a senior American counterterrorism official. ''One of these directions now seems to be Ansar.'' 
 The more diffuse terror threat played into the weaknesses of the Europe's patchwork intelligence system.
 ''The problem with intelligence in Europe is that we are far too bureaucratic and fragmented across borders,'' said a senior German intelligence official. ''Our security is much less integrated than our business or transportation infrastructures. We also have many different languages, while the terrorist cells all speak Arabic. The extremists also move relatively freely across borders. In this sense, ironically, they are more European than we are.''
 For years, European officials have talked about the need for a central repository for information about terrorist groups, but agencies have been reluctant, officials say. ''If the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. are fighting constantly about information, how do you think it is with the French and the Germans?'' said one Spanish official.
 At a European Union meeting in Brussels on Friday, counterterrorism officials agreed to appoint a ''terrorism czar'' to facilitate sharing of information about suspected terrorists. But even last week, German officials were furious that Spain had initially refused to divulge the type of explosives used in the Madrid bombings.

Elusive Suspects
Itinerant Militants Slip Across Borders
 In this atmosphere, perhaps it is not surprising that many suspects slipped through the cracks.
 One was Mohamed Daki, a 38-year-old Moroccan man, who came to Germany on a student visa to study engineering. According to the German authorities, Mr. Daki never enrolled in college, but he did find his way to Al Quds mosque in Hamburg, where he met members of the Qaeda cell that planned the Sept. 11 attacks.
 Beate Ragi, whose husband was a friend of Mr. Daki, said in an interview: ''My husband admired Daki because he was a true believer. He had visions and spoke in tongues.''
 When the German police questioned Mr. Daki three weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, he acknowledged that he knew members of the cell and that one of them, a fugitive named Ramzi bin al-Shibh, was registered as his roommate, according to German court documents. ''I know why I am here,'' Mr. Daki said when the police took him in for questioning, according to transcripts of his interrogation. But Mr. Daki apparently lied when asked whether a second suspect in the Sept. 11 plot was also registered at his apartment. German officials now acknowledge that they never investigated further.
 With no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Daki, the German police let him go. But, officials now concede, they also lost track of him. And, apparently, his name was not added to any international list of suspicious persons.
 Mr. Daki became another itinerant militant moving across Europe, intelligence officials said. He apparently attracted no attention in the spring of 2002 when he moved from Hamburg to Milan where Italian investigators say they suspect Mr. Daki eventually joined a Qaeda-related venture: recruiting fighters to take up arms against the American-led invasion of Iraq.
 Although American and European intelligence officials say they suspect the recruitment is linked to Mr. bin Laden through Mr. Zarqawi, it is not clear that Mr. Daki had any high-level contacts.
 Even so, just as he had become ensnared in a terrorism investigation in Hamburg in 2001, he fell under suspicion in Milan last March.
 The Italian authorities tracking the Milan cell eavesdropped on a call Mr. Daki had received from a man in Syria who had been in frequent contact with the Milan cell. His message was urgent: Mr. Daki and others had been detected and should flee.
 ''Listen to me attentively,'' the caller said, according to Italian police transcripts. ''Wait for my call. Move yourself to France and await orders.''
 The caller was Abderazek Mahdjoub, a resident of Hamburg who also had ties to Sept. 11 hijackers. Italian officials have charged that Mr. Mahdjoub, operating from Hamburg, headed the Milan cell.
 According to a senior German intelligence official, Mr. Mahdjoub had been under observation by German domestic intelligence since at least 2000. But Italian investigators were unaware of the German intelligence about either Mr. Mahdjoub or Mr. Daki until the Italians arrested members of the Milan cell last April, officials of both countries said.
 Eighteen months after Mr. Daki was first questioned in Hamburg, he was charged with aiding the Milan cell's logistics and forging documents.
 ''Looking back,'' said one Hamburg police investigator, ''I would say that we should have asked more pointed questions than we did.''

Pieces of a Puzzle
Investigators Struggle to Assemble Clues
 European intelligence officers have asked questions about Jamal Zougam for at least four years. But they did not begin to get all of the answers until the Madrid attacks.
 Mr. Zougam, the most noted of the 10 suspects arrested so far in the Madrid bombings, appears from court records and intelligence files to be a kind of militant Zelig -- shuttling between Morocco and Spain, befriending prominent extremists in several countries and worshiping with two well-known radical clerics.
 In 2000, the French became interested in Mr. Zougam during their pursuit of David Courtailler, a French convert to Islam now being tried in a terrorism case in Paris. The Moroccan authorities came upon Mr. Zougam later, as they pursued a pair of Moroccan militants, the Benyaich brothers, implicated in the 2003 bombings of a Spanish social club and other sites in Casablanca.
 By the time French investigators asked Spain for information about Mr. Zougam, he had already been detected in the intercepted telephone calls with the accused head of a Qaeda cell in Spain, Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas. In June 2001, the Spanish police searched Mr. Zougam's apartment and found telephone numbers and other information that showed his ties to other suspected members of Mr. Yarkas's cell.
 That cell took on new importance after Sept. 11, when investigators concluded it had assisted the hijackers who carried out the attacks. Although Spain arrested 40 Qaeda suspects over the next two years, Mr. Zougam was not among them.
 How Mr. Zougam escaped the net is not entirely clear. Spanish court documents suggest he had frequent contact with Mr. Yarkas, but one Spanish investigator described him as ''a follower, a secondary figure.'' Another Spanish law-enforcement official said the police focused more directly on Mr. Zougam in 2002, but by then he had grown notably more cautious about using the telephone.
 He apparently had many phones to use. The Spanish official said it was probably no accident that Mr. Zougam and one of his confederates, Said Chedadi, were both linked to the sale of falsified telephone cards and the fraudulent use of cellphones.
 ''They may have 20 phone cards to use,'' the official said. ''You might get up on one or two, but even then it is extremely difficult to follow them. One of them will say, 'Let's go eat cherries at the usual place.' But what are 'cherries?' What is 'eating?' What is the 'usual place?' You have to analyze the voices, the codes, who is who.''
 ''Every new phone number you get leads you to 10 more phones that talk to that person,'' the official added. ''Very quickly it becomes 100 phones, and you have to do paperwork every month to justify the surveillance on each phone.'' 
 The Spanish authorities have long experience battling terrorists, particularly the Basque separatist group ETA. And even before Sept. 11 they had been monitoring Mr. Yarkas and his associates for six years. But while the Sept. 11 attacks elevated the importance that the Spanish authorities accorded to the Islamist cells in their midst, they pursue them with a fraction -- perhaps one-third or one-fourth -- of the agents they assigned to ETA, two Spanish officials said. Like other Western governments, Spain has few Arabic speaking agents and little capacity to infiltrate militant cells. 
 None of the intelligence services that took note of Mr. Zougam rang what sounded like an alarm to the Spanish authorities. ''It was all fairly vague,'' one Spanish official said.
 In the aftermath of the Madrid bombings, fingers were pointing all around. A French official said it took months for the Spanish to address their initial request for information about Mr. Zougam. Spanish officials insisted they were the only ones that pursued him seriously. A Moroccan official said the Spanish were told early last summer that Mr. Zougam was ''very dangerous,'' but did not get back to them to ask any question -- until after the bombs in Madrid. 
 ''We're facing challenges we didn't face before,'' said Judge Garzon, the Spanish magistrate. ''If we don't act, if we don't make changes in real time, we are going to be lost.''

HEADLINE: Creeping Democracy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE. 
E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
''Democratic creep'' is not a derogation of a liberal candidate. On the contrary, it is the process -- now well under way -- by which free nations will win the world war on terror. 
 In Afghanistan, once a hotbed of Qaeda training and Taliban tyranny, nobody can deny we helped bring forth the beginnings of democratic government. Afghans, including newly liberated women, are helping track down fugitive killers. 
 In Iraq, we mourn our losses this past year, which now approach 2 percent of U.S. casualties in the Korean conflict. Many Iraqis died, too, but literally tens of thousands are alive today because Saddam did not have the power to torture and execute them -- as mass graves tell us he did every year of his savage misrule.
 Nobody can be certain that Iraq will remain whole and free after we turn over sovereignty on June 30. But prospects look far better than predicted by defeatists who claimed a year ago that political freedom had no chance of taking root in hostile Arab soil. 
 Free electricity keeps TV sets and air-conditioners humming, oil is flowing, schools and businesses have come to life. Unemployment, now over 30 percent, will surely drop as the $18 billion appropriated by the U.S. Congress -- part of the $87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan -- begins to flow heavily next month into reconstruction by Iraqi workers. (The W.P.A. lives.) 
 We are training a civilian defense corps, twice the size of a joint Shiite-Sunni-Kurdish army, to take over free Iraq's battle against the Ansar-Qaeda terrorists and Baathist diehards. With the transfer of political power to a transitional Iraqi government, public fury at the mortar and rocket attacks on ''soft target'' civilians will be a nationalizing, not a destabilizing, force -- directed not at occupiers but against the terrorist invaders.
 Next year, a trio of local politicians will emerge to lead the country. ''Three John Edwardses are out there awaiting their chance,'' says one observer. 
 Optimistic? In the grand design to uproot the causes of the rise of radical Islamic terrorism, defeat is no option. We have to believe in the popular success of a combination of democracy and prosperity. In this generation, the world has seen the power of the human desire for freedom.
 From Kuwait to Qatar, the coalition's overthrow of Saddam has been a political tonic. Libya's dictator is making weaponry concessions lest his economy be wrecked and he be ousted. Repressive Iran is ripening for revolution. Egypt's boss and Saudi Arabia's princes are nervous because an arc of democracy bids fair to extend from Turkey through Iraq to Israel, with literate, enterprising populations blazing a path to liberating prosperity in the greater Middle East.
 Syria's sullen Bashar al-Assad is feeling the heat. He benefited most from Saddam's corruption, probably provided a hiding place for Iraqi weapons and a route of entry into Iraq for Qaeda killers. His troops illegally occupy Lebanon; he supports Hezbollah and Hamas terrorists in rocket attacks and suicide bombings. His so-called intelligence sharing has been singularly unproductive.
 A million and a half Kurds live in Syria, despised by the rulers in Damascus. After Syrian Kurds saw the blessings of freedom flow to their ethnic comrades in Iraq, some were emboldened to respond to Arab taunting at a soccer game. Bashar's goons, remembering his father's bloody ''Hamas rules,'' shot a score of the unarmed protesters as a warning to the quarter-million Kurds the dictator keeps stateless.
 Congress, more hawkish than President Bush on this state sponsor of terror, passed the Syria Accountability Act four months ago with large majorities; this week, he is expected to put some of its authorized economic squeeze on Bashar. He should consider that Step One. 
 This unified American message -- substantial largess for free Iraq contrasted with the start of serious sanctions for despotic Syria -- will not be lost on the Arab League meeting in Tunisia.
 Success of democracy in Iraq is the key to democratic reform throughout the greater Middle East. When that reform dawns in Ramallah, there can be an independent, contiguous Palestine. When creeping democracy gradually brings a better life to people of the region, the basis for hatred and terror will erode and the suicide bomber will pass from the scene.

 BODY:
After a six-month trial, a jury in Manhattan is deliberating the fates of two former top executives of Tyco International. But at Tyco's headquarters in Princeton, N.J., its current executives are focusing on the company's recent run of profitable quarters. 
 ''My first six, eight months in this job, all people asked me about was Kozlowski and what he had done,'' said Edward D. Breen, who was brought in to run Tyco in the summer of 2002, after L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chairman and chief executive, had been indicted on criminal charges by a New York State Supreme Court grand jury. ''Now they ask me about how I'll keep funding organic growth.'' 
 Lower-level members of Tyco's work force of 260,000, distributed among five operating units, seem to feel little emotional stake in the question of whether Mr. Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, the former chief financial officer, are indeed guilty of looting Tyco of more than $600 million. 
 ''When they were first arrested, I felt really angry and betrayed, but now I feel detached,'' said Robin O. Roscillo, the manager of legal administration at United States Surgical, a Tyco unit in Norwalk, Conn. ''I'd never met any of them personally. So sure, I follow the trial, it makes for good reading. But so did Martha Stewart's. I just don't think it has an impact on me.'' 
 Back in 2002, in a series of startling disclosures, employees and shareholders learned that Tyco's top executives had been accused of playing fast and loose with corporate accounting and of using the company's coffers as personal piggy banks. Mr. Kozlowski and his team left the company so burdened with debt that many investors worried that Tyco was destined for bankruptcy. And since the trial of Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Swartz began in September, Tyco's name has appeared in many an unflattering news headline. And Tyco, burdened by $16.8 billion in debt, faces a difficult road to a full recovery. 
 That may be why Mr. Breen has not spent much time publicly crowing about the turnaround at Tyco. In the company's 2003 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, Tyco earned $980 million on revenues of $36.8 billion. It was a stark contrast to the fiscal 2002 loss of $9.2 billion on revenues of $35.6 billion -- the final, official figures after several financial restatements to correct bookkeeping problems during the Kozlowski era. 
 The comeback continues. In its fiscal 2004 first quarter, Tyco reported 8.7 percent revenue growth and net income of 34 cents a share, exceeding analysts forecasts by two cents and bettering the previous year's quarter by five cents. Compared with the tales of other companies tarred with scandal's brush, Tyco's story is surprisingly upbeat -- in no small part because Tyco is a conglomerate in which Mr. Kozlowski's role at the holding company was far removed from the operating units. In contrast to, say, Arthur Andersen, the defunct accounting firm whose sole product was the time spent by its partners and employees, Tyco makes hospital sutures, fire detectors, electronic connectors and a wide range of other tangible products that are judged by quality standards having little to do with missteps in the executive suite.
 Unlike Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, whose corporate and brand name is inextricably linked with a founder who has been declared a felon, Tyco never publicly aligned its image to Mr. Kozlowski's. And compared with Enron, many of whose employees lost their retirement savings when the company went under, Tyco's employees did not have the bulk of their retirement savings in company stock; and for those employees or other investors who did hold Tyco's stock, the share price has climbed almost halfway back to its prescandal level. 
 The stock, which had traded in the $50's in early 2002, dropped to $8.25 by July 25 of that year -- the day Mr. Breen, the former president of Motorola, was named Tyco's chairman and chief. 
 Tyco shares closed at $27.95 last Friday, and according to Thomson Financial, 13 of the 15 analysts who follow the company rate it a buy. 
 How did Tyco so quickly turn ignominy into trust? The faces in the executive suite, the ethics policies in the manuals, the reporting hierarchies -- virtually all are new since Mr. Breen's arrival. A week after being appointed, he ousted Mr. Swartz, more than a month before Mr. Swartz was indicted for fraud. Within a few months, he replaced Tyco's entire board, as well as 220 of its 250 top executives. 
 ''It wasn't easy and, no, I'm not sure every one of them needed to go,'' Mr. Breen recalled. ''But I couldn't take any chances.'' 
 Many big investors appreciate his quick action. Eli M. Salzmann, the director of large cap value funds at Lord Abbett & Company, had sold his Tyco stock in late 2000 because of ''information in the footnotes that we found troubling.'' But after several meetings with Mr. Breen and his new team, Mr. Salzmann started accumulating the stock again in the first quarter of 2003. Lord Abbett now holds more than 19 million shares.
 ''Ed Breen was, hands down, the catalyst that got me back into the stock,'' Mr. Salzmann said. The changes are multifold. Tyco's five divisions now jointly procure many goods and services, saving millions of dollars -- including $42 million cut from a bill for telecommunications bill that had totaled $350 million the year before. Tyco's 3,500 buildings and sites have been pared to 3,200, with an additional 200 locations scheduled for closing. Four Tyco divisions that previously had separate offices within miles of each other in Singapore, for example, are now in one location. The headquarters staff, previously ensconced in lavish Manhattan quarters, now work in an office park in Princeton. 
 All told, Mr. Breen expects that, by the end of 2006, Tyco will have shaved $1 billion off its $15 billion annual tab for goods and services.
 And Mr. Breen has said he will sell more than 50 Tyco businesses, many of which are in the fire and security unit, and all of which together account for about $2.1 billion in revenue. Many are only marginally profitable, while many others rely on franchising, which Mr. Breen wants Tyco to move away from in favor of direct sales. ''From an operating standpoint, we had been C-minus at best,'' Mr. Breen said. ''We're now aiming for A-plus.'' 
 Tyco is also aiming for higher marks in ethics. It has written and circulated a multipage ethics policy, and hired more than 100 internal auditors to enforce it. It has a new corporate ombudsman, Richard Baran, to address employee concerns about ethics or policies. All of Tyco's employees attended mandatory one-day ethics seminars last spring, and more detailed programs are in the works for its 25,000 managers. 
 In the past, said Laurie Siegel, the senior vice president for human resources, the practice was to award huge bonuses to anyone who ''somehow drove the numbers up.'' The new system assesses how well managers set and meet goals. As a result, Tyco's bonus budget for the fiscal year 2003 was reduced by $90 million. 
 Ms. Siegel acknowledges that many executives squawked at the reduced compensation, but she maintains that the ethics and bonus crackdowns have restored a sense of corporate pride. 
 Perhaps the biggest change at Tyco is its abandonment of laissez-faire management. Under Mr. Kozlowski, Tyco was an acquisition machine, a company that infinitely preferred buying a new business to closely managing an old one. Managers in what were then its six units -- in July 2002 Tyco spun off the CIT Group, the financing company it bought in 2001 -- were judged primarily on the quality of their deals. 
 ''We were given incentives to make acquisitions that immediately added to earnings, not to focus on innovation or operations,'' recalled Richard J. Meelia, the president of Tyco Healthcare and one of the few executives to survive Mr. Breen's purge. 
 Mr. Breen has also insisted that the business units provide sales forecasts and strategic plans, and pump money into product development. He has authorized Mr. Meelia, for instance, to gradually increase his spending on research to 4 percent of sales in 2007, twice the level of 2002. While it is still less than the 6 percent average in the health care industry, ''we're working towards that,'' Mr. Meelia said. 
 Tyco is not yet sailing a glass-smooth sea. Analysts predict that it may spend about $1.25 billion to settle shareholder suits, stemming from the bookkeeping irregularities and the former board's oversight of Mr. Kozlowski. While making a dent in the $18.1 billion net debt that Mr. Kozlowski left the company reeling under, Mr. Breen's team is still shouldering a net debt load of about $16.8 billion -- although it has promised to pay it down quickly. 
 Even Mr. Breen concedes that costs remain far too high. That is one reason why he continues to resist urgings by many shareholders to reincorporate in the United States, instead of remaining in Bermuda -- where under Mr. Kozlowski the company became incorporated as a tax shelter. Mr. Breen has repeatedly said that moving the company back to this country would cost too much in taxes, but the issue is again on the agenda for Tyco's annual meeting this Thursday in North Haven, Conn.
 Some analysts would also like to see Tyco sell even more businesses. Jack L. Kelly, a conglomerate analyst at Goldman Sachs, cites plastics as a business that, while profitable, does not fit Tyco's portfolio. 
 Timing may be on Tyco's side. Its health care division is benefiting from an aging population. And many experts expect the improving economy to spur commercial and industrial construction, which will be a boon for Tyco's fire and security units and its electronics parts business. 
 ''Next year I'll bet they get back into the acquisition game,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''And maybe, after the shareholder suits are settled, they can raise the dividend and buy stock.''

HEADLINE: Despite Sluggish Economy, Welfare Rolls Actually Fell

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21 

 BODY:
In a trend that has surprised many experts, the federal welfare rolls have declined over the last three years, even as unemployment, poverty and the number of food stamp recipients have surged in a weak economy.
 After Congress overhauled the nation's welfare system in 1996, the number of families receiving benefits dropped much faster than federal and state officials had expected. Even more remarkable, officials say, the rolls did not grow during the recession of 2001 or the sluggish economy since.
 In fact, in the last three years, the number of families on welfare has declined slightly, to two million, which is less than half the number receiving public assistance when President Bill Clinton signed the welfare law in August 1996.
 Experts suggest many reasons. People work harder to find jobs before seeking public assistance. Welfare recipients have learned job skills and a work ethic. States provide child care and other noncash help so they can keep jobs after leaving welfare. And, some experts say, new rules and requirements may intimidate poor people from seeking welfare. 
 Mark H. Greenberg, a lawyer at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a research and advocacy group, said, ''One of the great mysteries of social policy in the last few years is why welfare caseloads have stayed essentially flat or declined in much of the country, despite the economic downturn.''
 In past recessions, newly hired welfare recipients and other low-skilled workers were among the first to lose their jobs. But that was apparently not the case with the most recent recession. 
 ''Former welfare recipients were entrenched in the work force,'' said Marva Arnold, a senior official at the Human Services Department in Illinois, where the number of families on welfare has plunged 45 percent since January 2001, to 38,276. ''They have gained real work experience, including the skills needed to maintain employment.''
 The 1996 welfare law contributed to a big increase in the proportion of single mothers in paid jobs outside the home. Robert L. Doar, commissioner of the New York State welfare agency, said, ''Their attachment to the work force has proved stronger than many people expected.''
 In New York, the number of families receiving aid under the main federal welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, has declined 39 percent since January 2001, to 140,758.
 Heidi J. Hart, 27, of Portland, Me., was on welfare as a child and again as a parent, from 1995 to 2001. ''I got pregnant at 15, became a mom at 16 and almost dropped out of high school,'' she said. The state allowed her to attend college while receiving public assistance.
 ''Welfare is no way to live,'' Ms. Hart said, ''but I had to feed my baby somehow.'' She received $500 a month in welfare and food stamps, but now earns $2,200 a month at a child abuse prevention program.
 Wade F. Horn, assistant United States secretary of health and human services in charge of welfare policy, said that the current welfare program had become relatively ''recession-proof.'' 
 But Shawn Fremstad, a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, said, ''Falling caseloads amid rising poverty should be a cause for concern.''
 Wendell E. Primus, a welfare official in the Clinton administration who resigned to protest signing of the 1996 law, amplified that concern: ''It's an indictment of the welfare law, the welfare system, that it has not been more responsive to economic conditions.''
 Food stamps have been more sensitive to fluctuations in the economy. The number of households receiving food stamps has increased 35 percent in the last three years, to 10 million.
 Some families have left the cash welfare rolls because they reached the time limits set by federal and state laws. Some have been removed from the rolls as a penalty for failing to comply with work requirements.
 In some states, the application process is so difficult or complex that it may discourage people from seeking public assistance for which they are eligible.
 The federal welfare program ''is serving a smaller and smaller proportion of people who are poor enough to qualify,'' said Sharon Parrott, a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
 Robert E. Rector, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said, ''In most states, welfare has become a less attractive option.''
 That appears to be the case in Texas. Michael A. Jones, a spokesman for the state's Department of Human Services, said: ''Our welfare program has a very strong pro-work message. People are more reluctant to rely on public assistance if they can find other means to support themselves. They're more likely to rely on family and friends to get by temporarily if they lose their jobs after leaving the rolls.''
 The number of Texas families on welfare has declined 11 percent in the last three years, to 116,166. The state has strict time limits -- one year of cash assistance for the head of a household who has a high school diploma and some work experience, Mr. Jones said.
 While over all the nation's welfare rolls have shrunk in the last three years, they have grown substantially in some states, including Arizona (46 percent), Indiana (34 percent), Nevada (38 percent) and Wisconsin (29 percent).
 Nevada's gambling and hotel industries were hit hard by cutbacks in travel and tourism after the terrorist attacks of September 2001. In Wisconsin, which pioneered welfare changes in the early 1990's, officials attribute the recent increase to the sluggish national economy.
 Several states, like Rhode Island and Washington, said that by investing heavily in child care, they had made it possible for former welfare recipients to stay off welfare even in hard times.
 Jane A. Hayward, director of the Rhode Island Department of Human Services, said that in her state, any family with income less than 225 percent of the poverty level was entitled to state-subsidized child care. (The poverty level for a family of three is $15,670 a year.) Unlike many states, Ms. Hayward said, ''we don't have waiting lists for child care.''
 The number of families on welfare in Rhode Island has declined 12.5 percent since January 2001, to 14,026, the lowest level since 1994, Ms. Hayward said.
 In Washington State, the unemployment rate rose sharply, in part because of layoffs at Boeing, its suppliers and related businesses. But the number of families on welfare has been stable, around 56,000.
 Kenneth Miller, an aide to Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat, suggested one reason: ''We preserved our child care benefits. Folks who went off welfare and got jobs paying $8 to $10 an hour can continue working because they have child care.''
 Another reason, he said, is that the state used its extensive network of community colleges to train welfare recipients. ''We provided free tuition to many of those folks,'' he said. ''They now understand how to use the community college system.''
 Economists and welfare officials said that the market for low-wage workers held up better than expected in the last few years.
 ''This recession appears to have affected higher-wage workers more than lower-wage workers,'' said Mr. Doar, the New York official.
 Ms. Arnold, the Illinois official, said: ''White-collar employees, managers and supervisors were hit first by the economic decline. Our customers were somewhat protected because they had not moved up to those jobs.''

HEADLINE: Pinch at the Pump

 BODY:
The cost of gasoline is rising again. The average price reached $1.72 a gallon last week, just a couple pennies below the all-time record. Without a turnaround in the price of oil, which has roared to a one-year high of $38 a barrel, or a magical increase in refining capacity, prices are likely to rise higher still. This means discomfort for motorists and real pain for truckers and airlines. It also means, this being an election year, a certain amount of political grandstanding. If the Senate's initial response is any guide, Washington will choose short-term fixes over the tougher long-term solutions required. 
 The Senate's response to inflation at the pump was an unenthusiastic vote -- 52 to 43 -- to divert millions of barrels of oil earmarked for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for sale on the open market. The House has yet to concur while the administration opposes the idea, arguing that it is more important to fulfill President Bush's post-9/11 pledge to fill the reserve to its 700 million-barrel capacity.
 There's nothing inherently wrong with using the reserve to help relieve market pressures on a temporary basis -- President Clinton tapped the reserve for about 30 million barrels in 2000 to ease a shortage of home heating oil in the Northeast. But it should be done sparingly. The main purpose of the reserve, after all, is to provide backup supply in a genuine national emergency, and a price spike is not a national emergency. If we did, for some reason, decide to use the reserve to drive down prices, it would only work at the margins and for a short time. The reserves are no match for the pricing power of oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia. The Persian Gulf nations alone produce 900 million barrels a year, half again of what lies in the salt domes of Texas and Louisiana.
 A much better way to strengthen America's leverage, as this page has suggested before, is for the United States to limit its own consumption of energy. There are many ways to do that, but the most straightforward is to raise fuel economy standards by significant amounts. This is exactly what the country did after the oil shocks of the 1970's, resulting in huge savings in imported oil.
 Unfortunately, memories are short in the United States Congress. The energy bills that have passed the House and await action in the Senate not only ignore fuel economy. They also encourage the unhealthy fiction that a country that uses about one-quarter of the world's oil but owns just over 2 percent of the world's reserves can somehow drill its way out of dependency. It can't be done. Until the nation faces up to that fact, it will remain dependent on a few important producers, and its economic and strategic vulnerability will continue. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 24, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on Monday misstated the annual crude oil production of the oil-producing nations of the Persian Gulf. The correct figure is 7.7 billion barrels.

HEADLINE: In Florida Groves, Cheap Labor Means Machines

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

DATELINE: IMMOKALEE, Fla. 

 BODY:
Chugging down a row of trees, the pair of canopy shakers in Paul Meador's orange grove here seem like a cross between a bulldozer and a hairbrush, their hungry steel bristles working through the tree crowns as if untangling colossal heads of hair.
 In under 15 minutes, the machines shake loose 36,000 pounds of oranges from 100 trees, catch the fruit and drop it into a large storage car. ''This would have taken four pickers all day long,'' Mr. Meador said. 
 Canopy shakers are still an unusual sight in Florida's orange groves. Most of the crop is harvested by hand, mainly by illegal Mexican immigrants. Nylon sacks slung across their backs, perched atop 16-foot ladders, they pluck oranges at a rate of 70 to 90 cents per 90-pound box, or less than $75 a day. 
 But as globalization creeps into the groves, it is threatening to displace the workers. Facing increased competition from Brazil and a glut of oranges on world markets, alarmed growers here have been turning to labor-saving technology as their best hope for survival.
 ''The Florida industry has to reduce costs to stay in business,'' said Everett Loukonen, agribusiness manager for the Barron Collier Company, which uses shakers to harvest about half of the 40.5 million pounds of oranges reaped annually from its 10,000 acres in southwestern Florida. ''Mechanical harvesting is the only available way to do that today.'' 
 Global competition is pressing American farmers on many fronts. American raisins are facing competition from Chile and Turkey. For fresh tomatoes, the challenge comes from Mexico. China, whose Fuji apples have displaced Washington's Golden Delicious from most Asian markets -- and whose apple juice has swamped the United States -- is cutting into American farmers' markets for garlic, broccoli and a host of other crops.
 So even while President Bush advances a plan to invite legal guest workers into American fields, farmers for the first time in a generation are working to replace hand laborers with machines. 
 ''The rest of the world hand-picks everything, but their wage rates are a fraction of ours,'' said Galen Brown, who led the mechanical harvesting program at the Florida Department of Citrus until his retirement last year. Lee Simpson, a raisin grape grower in California's San Joaquin Valley, is more blunt. ''The cheap labor,'' he said, ''isn't cheap enough.'' 
 Mr. Simpson and other growers have devised a system that increases yields and cuts the demand for workers during the peak harvest time by 90 percent; rather than cutting grapes by hand and laying them out to dry, the farmers let the fruit dry on the vine before it is harvested mechanically.
 Some fruit-tree growers in Washington State have introduced a machine that knocks cherries off the tree onto a conveyor belt; they are trying to perfect a similar system for apples. Strawberry growers in Ventura County, Calif., developed a mobile conveyor belt to move full strawberry boxes from the fields to storage bins, cutting demand for workers by a third. And producers of leaf lettuce and spinach for bag mixes have introduced mechanical cutters. 
 American farmers have been dragging machines into their fields at least since the mid-19th century, when labor shortages during the Civil War drove a first wave of mechanical harvesting. Mechanization grew apace for the following 100-plus years, taking over the harvesting of crops including wheat, corn, cotton and sugar cane. 
 But not all crops were easily adaptable to machines. Whole fruit and vegetables -- the most lucrative and labor intensive crops, employing four of every five seasonal field workers -- require delicate handling. Mechanization sometimes meant rearranging the fields, planting new types of vines or trees and retrofitting packing plants.
 Rather than make such investments, farmers mostly focused on lobbying government for easier access to inexpensive labor. California growers, the biggest fruit and vegetable producers in the nation, persuaded the government to admit Mexican workers during World War I. Later, from 1942 to 1964, 4.6 million Mexican farm workers were admitted into the country under the bracero guest-worker program. 
 Investment in technology generally happened when the immigrant spigot was shut. After the bracero program ended and some farm wages began to rise, scientists at the University of California at Davis began work on both a machine to harvest tomatoes mechanically and a tomato better suited to mechanical harvesting. 
 By 1970, the number of tomato-harvest jobs had been cut by two-thirds. But the tomato harvester's success proved to be a kiss of death for mechanical harvesting. In 1979, the farm worker advocacy group California Rural Legal Assistance, with support from the United Farm Workers union of Cesar Chavez, sued U.C. Davis, charging that it was using public money for research that displaced workers and helped only big growers. 
 The lawsuit was eventually settled. But even before that, in 1980, President Jimmy Carter's agriculture secretary, Bob Bergland, declared that the government would no longer finance research projects intended to replace ''an adequate and willing work force with machines.'' Today, the Agricultural Research Service employs just one agricultural engineer: Donald Peterson, a longtime researcher at the Appalachian Fruit Research Station in Kearneysville, W.Va. 
 ''At one time I was told to keep a low profile and not to publicize what I was doing,'' Mr. Peterson said. 
 As the government pulled out, growers lost interest as well, refocusing on Congress instead. In 1986, farmers were instrumental in winning passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which legalized nearly three million illegal immigrants -- more than a third under a special program for agriculture.
 Farmers' investments in labor-saving technology all but froze, and gains in labor productivity slowed. From 1986 to 1999, farm labor inputs fell 2.4 percent, after a drop of 35 percent in the preceding 14 years. Meanwhile, farmers' capital investments fell 46.7 percent from their peak in 1980 through 1999. 
 About 45 vegetable and fruit crops planted over 3.6 million acres of land, and worth about $13 billion at the farm gate, are still harvested by hand, by a labor force made up mostly of illegal immigrants. On average, farm workers earned $6.18 an hour, less than half the average wage for private, nonfarm workers, in 1998, the year of the Labor Department's most recent survey of agricultural workers.
 Florida's orange groves have reflected the broader trends. In the 1980's, a 20-year research effort into mechanical harvesting ground to a halt. With frosts upstate taking 200,000 acres out of production, orange prices soared and the demand for labor fell. 
 But as is often the case in agriculture, farmers overreacted to the market's strength, flocking to plant groves among the vegetable patches, pastures and swamps in the southwestern part of the state. By the early 1990's, the market looked poised for a glut. With the prospect of bumper crops in Brazil, where harvesting costs are about one-third as high as in Florida, a crisis loomed -- driving orange growers back into technology's embrace. 
 In 1995, the growers decided to plow $1 million to $1.5 million a year into research in mechanical harvesting. By the 1999-2000 harvest, the growers had achieved their technological breakthrough, with four different harvesting machines working commercially. Last year, machines harvested 17,000 acres of the state's 600,000 acres planted in juice oranges, said Fritz M. Roka, an agricultural economist at the University of Florida.
 ''Mechanical harvesting is the biggest change in the Florida citrus industry since we switched to aluminum ladders,'' said Will Elliott, general manager of Coe-Collier Citrus Harvesting, one of seven commercial contractors that are shaking trunks and brushing canopies around the state. 
 Mr. Brown, the retired Department of Citrus official, estimates that in five years, machines will harvest 100,000 acres of oranges here. But there are obstacles. Machines work best on the big, regularly spaced, groomed young groves in the southwest, and some do not work at all on the smaller, older, more irregular acreage in central Florida. Machines are hard to use on Valencia orange trees, because shaking them risks prematurely dislodging much of the following year's harvest.
 Still, the economics are in mechanization's favor. A tariff of 29 cents per pound on imports of frozen concentrated orange juice lets Florida growers resist the Brazilian onslaught -- but not by much. According to Ronald Muraro and Thomas Spreen, researchers at the University of Florida, Brazil could deliver a pound of frozen concentrate in the United States for under 75 cents, versus 99 cents for a Florida grower. 
 Mechanical harvesting can help cut the gap. Mr. Loukonen of Barron Collier estimates that machine harvesting shaves costs by 8 to 10 cents a pound of frozen concentrate. 
 The spread of mechanization could redraw the profile of Immokalee, which today is a rather typical American farming town. Seventy-one percent of the population of 20,000 is Latino -- with much of the balance coming from Haiti -- and 46 percent of the residents are foreign born, according to the 2000 census. About 40 percent of the residents live under the poverty line, and the median family income is below $23,000 -- less than half that of the United States as a whole.
 Philip Martin, an economist at U.C. Davis, points to the poverty as an argument in favor of labor-saving technology. He estimates that about 10 percent of immigrant farm workers leave the fields every year to seek better jobs. Rather than push more farmhands out of work, he contends, introducing machines will simply reduce the demand for new workers to replenish the labor pool. 
 And there are some beneficiaries among workers: those lucky enough to operate the new gear. Perched in the air-conditioned booth of Mr. Meador's canopy shaker, a jumpy ranchera tune crackling from the radio, Felix Real, a former picker, said he can make up to $120 a day driving the contraption down the rows, about twice as much as he used to make. 
 Yet many Immokalee workers are nervous. ''They are using the machines on the good groves and leaving us with the scraggly ones,'' said Venancio Torres, an immigrant from Mexico's coastal state of Veracruz who has been picking oranges in Florida for three years. 
 Mr. Loukonen, the Barron Collier manager, said the farm workers were right to be anxious. ''If there's no demand for labor, supply will end,'' he said. ''They will have to find another place to work, or stay in their country.''

HEADLINE: Both Sides Polish Badges To Appear the Best Suited To Fight Corporate Crime

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21 

 BODY:
At a time when Martha Stewart is confronting the likelihood of donning prison orange, when Enron executives are still doing the perp walk and new Wall Street scandals are erupting with regularity, President Bush is working hard to cast himself as the leader of the charge to protect employees and investors from corporate malfeasance.
 ''We had to confront corporate crimes that cost people their jobs and their savings,'' Mr. Bush said to cheers in a speech to donors this month at a Houston hotel a dozen blocks from Enron's headquarters. ''So we passed strong corporate reforms and made it very clear, we will not tolerate dishonesty in the boardrooms of America.'' 
 In raising the issue in nearly every campaign appearance he makes, Mr. Bush is addressing a political challenge that extends well beyond the fallout from the allegations of fraud and other wrongdoing in the executive suites that came to light on his watch.
 Senator John Kerry and his Democratic allies are running an unabashedly populist campaign against Mr. Bush, portraying him and Vice President Dick Cheney in speeches and interviews as champions of corporate executives at the expense of working people during a period when the economy is not creating many new jobs.
 They start with the personal. They point out that Mr. Cheney, immediately before becoming Mr. Bush's running mate, was chief executive of Halliburton, the oil services giant whose rebuilding contracts in Iraq are under scrutiny by the Pentagon and the Justice Department. And they note at every opportunity that Mr. Bush, a former oilman himself, has always had close ties to business leaders, like Enron's former chairman, Kenneth L. Lay -- ''Kenny Boy'' to the president -- who was once one of his most generous donors.
 More broadly, Democrats are trying to make a case that this White House is a tool of powerful special interests, supports companies that ship American jobs overseas, allows pharmaceutical makers to gouge consumers, is more interested in corporate bottom lines than environmental protection and backs management over unions.
 At a forum this month in Evanston, Ill., Mr. Kerry talked about how he would be a president whose ''idea of diversity in government is not to have oil executives from different companies'' setting policy. Mr. Bush's administration, Mr. Kerry said, cares mostly ''about the general welfare of large corporations and particularly the drug industry, the oil industry and the other rich people who can make a difference in Washington with all that lobbying and all that money.''
 Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush are pressing their cases just as corporate and financial wrongdoing have again become big news. Ms. Stewart's trial and conviction, the indictment last month of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, the indictment this month of Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, and the revelations that the Royal Dutch/Shell Group misstated its oil reserves have all helped push the topic back into the political arena.
 ''It's going to be very difficult for Bush to insulate himself from those attacks from Kerry and the Democrats,'' said James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington. ''When you see a close connection between corporate America and the White House, that can be very damaging for an incumbent when the election is about his performance on the economy.''
 Mr. Bush has been working to make sure he is on the right side of the issue since long before the campaign got under way. Mr. Bush regularly invokes his decision to sign into law in 2002 the most far-reaching legislation to emerge from Congress after the initial raft of corporate scandals, a measure that extensively overhauled corporate fraud, securities and accounting laws and regulations. (He does not mention that he was a late convert to the bill, after initially opposing many of its main provisions.)
 White House officials say the wave of prosecutions show the administration is tough on corporate crime and beholden to no one. 
 To a group of supporters at a Y.M.C.A. in Ardmore, Pa., last week, Mr. Bush laid some of the responsibility for the economy's troubles on ''some C.E.O.'s that weren't honest with their shareholders and their employees'' and said the corporate fraud legislation was having its intended effect.
 ''You're now beginning to see on your TV screens what we're talking about,'' Mr. Bush said.
 But to Democrats, the corporate scandals are just a political ice breaker for their broader critique. They cite polls that have found what one Democratic strategist with ties to the Kerry campaign called Mr. Bush's ''soft underbelly,'' a sense among voters that the president is more aligned with powerful corporate interests than with regular people. In a CBS News poll at the end of last month, 55 percent answered yes when asked if many of Mr. Bush's decisions are influenced by special interests (the figure for Mr. Kerry was 38 percent).
 Mr. Kerry's advantage on the issue by other measures is not overwhelming, though. When asked in a New York Times/CBS News poll this month how much Mr. Bush cared about ''the needs and problems of people like you,'' 63 percent answered a lot or some, and 36 percent answered not much or not at all. When asked the same question about Mr. Kerry, 70 percent said a lot or some and 21 percent said not much or not at all.
 Mr. Bush's advisers profess not to be worried.
 ''If you look back 5, 10, 20 years, voters have always had a tendency to think Republicans are too close to corporate interests,'' said Matthew Dowd, Mr. Bush's chief campaign strategist. ''But that doesn't mean it affects voters in how they actually vote.''
 Mr. Bush speaks out forcefully on the topic because ''as a former businessman he believes there are ethics and laws people ought to abide by,'' Mr. Dowd said, and because the scandals ''had an effect on the economy and a huge effect on the stock market.'' 
 As to the broader populist assault by the Democrats, Mr. Dowd said Mr. Bush proved he could parry that line of attack when it was used by Al Gore in 2000.
 ''The American public doesn't respond very well to rich versus poor or rich versus middle class,'' Mr. Dowd said.
 ''I know it's a message that the Democrats seem to talk about every time Bob Shrum gets a hold of a candidate,'' he added, referring to the Democratic strategist employed by both Mr. Gore and Mr. Kerry. ''But there's no reason to think it will work any better today than four years ago.''

HEADLINE: U.S.-Backed Rightist Claims Victory in Salvador Election

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 21 

 BODY:
After a bitter campaign for president in El Salvador, a conservative pro-American businessman claimed victory Sunday night over a battle-hardened former Communist guerrilla.
 The ruling party's candidate, Antonio Saca, 39, a right-wing media mogul tacitly supported by the United States, was winning 57 percent of the vote in early returns. Schafik Handal, 73, a longtime left-wing leader, had 36 percent. If the final vote does not give Mr. Saca more than 50 percent, a runoff is set for May 2. 
 The campaign revived cold war fervor in El Salvador, where an estimated 75,000 people died as an American-backed government fought left-wing rebels between 1980 and 1992.
 Mr. Saca's party, the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, was linked to death-squad killings in the 1980's. Mr. Handal's party, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front was the rebel force that fought the government. After a 1992 peace treaty, the front became a legitimate party and now controls 31 of 84 seats, a plurality, in Congress.
 Otto Reich, President Bush's special envoy for the Western Hemisphere, and Roger Noriega, an assistant secretary of state, implied in public statements that El Salvador's commercial, economic and political relations with the United States could suffer if the leftist won.
 But Arena has controlled power in El Salvador since the 1980's, and claimed Sunday night that it kept control.
 President Francisco Flores is among the most pro-American leaders in the Western Hemisphere, and his apparent successor, Mr. Saca, has vowed to continue his policies, including free trade with the United States and use of the United States dollar as the official currency.
 ARENA, whose campaign colors are red, white and blue, argued that the United States could cut the flow of money from Salvadoran migrants in the United States if Mr. Handal won.
 Mr. Handal promised to bring the 380-troop Salvadoran contingent home from Iraq, restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, tax the rich more heavily, increase government spending for the poor and still seek good relations with the United States.

HEADLINE: Bush Aide Sees $1 Trillion Gap in Kerry's Plans

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21 

 BODY:
President Bush's re-election campaign on Sunday pressed its case that Senator John Kerry would either raise taxes more substantially than he has acknowledged or deepen the budget deficit.
 Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, released an analysis that he said showed a $1 trillion gap over the next decade between spending increases Mr. Kerry has called for during the campaign and the tax increases he has already supported. 
 Citing government estimates, newspaper reports and figures developed by research organizations, the analysis put a price tag of $1.7 trillion for the next 10 years on 28 major programs advocated by Mr. Kerry during his campaign. It said the tax increases Mr. Kerry had called for would raise about $700 billion over the same period, leaving a $1 trillion gap.
 In an advertisement this month, the Bush campaign said that Mr. Kerry would have to raise taxes by at least $900 billion.
 Mr. Mehlman said Republicans would spend this week aggressively seeking to define Mr. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, as economically irresponsible. Congressional Republicans would join the attack, he said, and the Republican National Committee planned to put on its Web site a Kerry ''Spend-o-Meter'' to track his spending commitments.
 Mr. Kerry's aides shot back that it was laughable for the Bush White House to criticize anyone on economic and fiscal policy, given that it had presided over a loss of more than two million jobs and a swing from large and growing budget surpluses to deficits that are setting new records in dollar terms.
 They said Mr. Bush was trying to change the subject from the statements this weekend by a former national security aide in the Bush and Clinton administrations, Richard A. Clarke, suggesting that Mr. Bush had not done everything possible to fight Al Qaeda before Sept. 11, 2001.
 ''George Bush has been the steward of the worst economy since the Great Depression, and now he is hypocritically criticizing John Kerry for his efforts to put the nation back on track,'' Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Kerry's spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''His fiscal recklessness and overspending have wasted $10 trillion dollars, putting the nation into record deficits, forcing states to raise tuition and taxes, and leaving future generations with higher costs and debts for decades to come.''
 The biggest component of the Mr. Kerry's spending projections is a $900 billion health insurance plan. He has called for repealing the Bush tax cuts on people earning more than $200,000, a shift the Bush campaign said would bring in a little more than $500 billion over the next decade.
 Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to Mr. Kerry, said that Mr. Kerry was working on a detailed plan and that the Bush campaign's analysis was based on flawed estimates. Mr. Kerry, he said, ''is completely committed to paying for new initiatives and living within the budget rules, two things this administration has been notable for abandoning.''

HEADLINE: Electronics That Enhance an Image (Yours)

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. 

 BODY:
The idea of spending $25,000 to $200,000 to watch television may seem unreasonable to most people, but according to industry analysts, a growing number of consumers find that this is not an unreasonable proposition. 
 That was apparent at a recent invitation-only show here, as a well-heeled crowd stood in hushed groups surrounded by elegant pictures emanating from items gracefully positioned around a gallerylike store on Rodeo Drive. The event was the introduction of new audio and video products from Bang & Olufsen, a Danish maker of highly styled and high-priced TV's and sound systems.
 The mass market in America may swoon over a $29 DVD player, but Bang & Olufsen's customers have no problem paying 50 times that amount to help create what they believe is the ultimate home entertainment experience.
 ''My clients buy several Bang & Olufsen systems at a time for their homes,'' said Doni Flanigan, an interior designer whose clients include Kirstie Alley, Rodney Dangerfield and Oscar De La Hoya. Mr. Flanigan had come in search of new equipment for his projects. 
 In the United States, Bang & Olufsen sells its audio and video equipment through 58 company and franchised stores, up from 53 stores a year ago. Its least expensive television, the BeoVision Avant, a wide-screen direct-view 30-inch model, costs $8,500.
 While televisions and DVD players have become commodity items, made in China to reduce costs, a few companies are focusing on a small but growing segment of the market by producing extremely high-end devices for people seeking the best possible audio and visual experience.
 Interest in expensive products has increased even as prices for high-definition televisions and surround sound systems have fallen, in part because the superior image quality of mass-marketed HDTV's has shown consumers how big a difference advanced technology can make. 
 There is little overall sales data on this specialty segment of the market. But according to Bill Ablondi, an analyst with Parks Associates, a research firm in Dallas, revenues for equipment dealers that sell and install audio and video systems -- typically expensive systems that buyers do not install themselves -- grew 19 percent in 2003, to $6.3 billion. 
 Companies that cater to the carriage trade are typically small, with offices and factories in Britain, Canada, the United States and Western Europe. Customers tend to learn about these products through publications like the Robb Report, The Absolute Sound magazine and its sister publication, The Perfect Vision. ''Our audience is the perfectionist and enthusiast. They are like the sports car aficionado who can tell that his tire is two pounds underinflated,'' said Robert Harley, the editor in chief of The Perfect Vision and The Absolute Sound. 
 Some companies say business has never been better. ''Last year saw our biggest quarter ever,'' said Sam Runco, founder and chief executive of Runco International, based in Union City, Calif. 
 The company, which had revenues of $50 million in 2003, is generally credited with coining the term ''home theater.'' Its front projector products, like the WideVision and Video Xtreme models, which range from $6,000 to $120,000, are often used in home screening rooms to create cinema-sized pictures. Add theaterlike seating and surround sound, and the package can easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
 Mr. Runco said that custom lenses and electronic video processing techniques produce a discernibly higher-quality picture. ''That's why the company can sell a video projector for $27,000 when others sell products containing similar components for $10,000,'' Mr. Runco said. ''And we sell a lot of them.'' 
 Most companies like Runco buy components from big manufacturers, like Mitsubishi, NEC and Philips, and then add special processing technologies to improve the performance of the products and justify the higher prices. 
 ''It's all about picture quality,'' said Kevin Zarow, director of marketing and product development for Marantz, an audio and video maker owned by D&M Holdings of Japan. 
 Even cheap DVD players produce excellent pictures, but Mr. Zarow notes that circuitry in his company's $1,600 unit produces ''better black levels, better color and fewer visual artifacts,'' and it is all housed in a heavy chassis for stability.
 The arrival of high-definition television has been a significant factor in pushing up sales in the high-end sector. ''The best thing that ever happened to us was HDTV,'' said Tom Harvey, vice president of Faroudja Laboratories. ''Other manufacturers are now telling our story -- that 'good enough' never is.'' For years, the company's picture enhancement technology has been integrated into a wide range of camcorders. Today it sells a range of plasma TV's and projectors priced from $10,000 to $375,000.
 While Faroudja's publicly traded parent, Genesis Microchip, does not break out sales figures, ''the division is profitable,'' Mr. Harvey said.
 Tom Edwards, senior vice president for consumer electronics at Pacific Media Associates, a large-screen display research firm in Menlo Park, Calif., said: ''The middle has evaporated; people will spend more money to get what they perceive to be a better product.''
 At Bang & Olufsen, worldwide sales for the six months ended Nov. 30, 2003, decreased 17 percent, to $282 million, from the same period in 2002. Profit for the period was down 20 percent, to $18 million. But in explaining the decrease, executives cited exchange rate fluctuations and the timing of new product releases.
 Michael Aagaard Andersen, president of Bang & Olufsen America, said he expected to see an upturn as the economy improved. ''The United States is our No.1 priority in the group,'' he said. In response to the establishment of the digital TV standard in the United States, the company introduced a line of TV's for the American market in 2000. 
 The company thinks that the growing interest among Americans in home theater systems will improve its sales. Mr. Andersen said that two-thirds of customers now have the company install an entire customized system, double the number three years ago.
 The growth in the high-end market is not limited to video. As the picture quality from home projectors has improved to rival cinemas in size and sharpness, customers are demanding sound systems that match.
 Vacuum tube-based amplifiers, made by Conrad-Johnson, based in Fairfax, Va., for example can cost more than $6,000. Another audio component manufacturer, Meridian Audio Limited, of Huntingdon, England, sells a DVD and DVD-audio player that is priced at $20,000. For those with somewhat smaller budgets Meridian also offers models starting at around $6,000. 
 Meridian expects to increase sales this year to $20 million, up from $16 million in 2002, said Robert Stuart, its co-founder and chairman. Sales in the United States account for about 35 percent of Meridian's revenue. The company is the only maker of digital speakers; each unit contains its own electronics and signal processing, which Mr. Stuart says creates a cleaner, distortion-free sound.
 Meridian's speakers range from $4,000 to $45,000 per pair. 
 With 115 employees worldwide, the company exports to 50 countries. While Meridian buys components made in Asia, all manufacturing is done in Britain. ''We've never thought about outsourcing our products, because our customers don't want a Meridian speaker made in China,'' Mr. Stuart said. ''It would damage the brand.''
 Indeed the cachet of exclusivity -- of buying products that are not made by a large electronics company or made in Asia -- is a significant draw for wealthy customers. ''If a product is distributed broadly,'' Sam Runco said, ''it's unlikely that my customers would want it. They wouldn't own a Sony, or Zenith, or RCA product.''
 Still, that has not stopped large electronics companies from attempting to grab a piece of the profitable high-end market. 
 RCA sells two models of rear-projection TV's, which use digital light processing technology, starting at $6,000 retail. This month, Sony will begin shipping its SXRD model, a $30,000 front-projector system. And LG Electronics has repositioned the company, making its Zenith brand an entry level product, while promoting the LG name as the brand for connoisseurs.
 LG's largest plasma model, a 76-inch unit, will ''sell to the billionaire market,'' and be priced accordingly, said John Taylor, the company's vice president for public affairs.
 And at this level of the market, bragging rights rather than performance often takes precedence. ''I buy expensive audio and video equipment for my clients because I'm an image maker,'' Mr. Flanigan, the interior designer, said. But when thinking about the prices for those products, he admitted that ''the word 'obscene' does come to mind.''


CORRECTION-DATE: March 25, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about companies that are focusing on extremely high-end audio and video products misstated the pricing of RCA rear-projection televisions that use digital light processing technology. This year the company will begin selling two models of the Profiles line that start at $8,999, not $6,000. RCA also has less expensive models that use the technology.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn College Professor Sees a City of Tilapia Tanks

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
It takes a tough borough to breed a tender fish, Dr. Martin P. Schreibman likes to say.
 And the roughly 3,000 Brooklyn-bred tilapia Dr. Schreibman grows in tanks in his aquaculture lab grow up hardy and with the requisite dose of attitude.
 To prove it, Dr. Schreibman, a biology professor at Brooklyn College, grabbed a handful of food pellets the other day and tossed them into a tilapia tank. The plump, purple fish gulped at the food in a frenzy that made the tank look like a Jacuzzi. 
 But once on the dinner plate, they are sweet and flaky, said Dr. Schreibman, a Brooklyn native himself. ''Two things Brooklyn water is good for,'' he said, reciting another of his catchphrases. ''Making bagels and growing fish.''
 Dr. Schreibman, 68, has been preaching the virtues of tilapia for years -- and growing them, too -- in the lab he founded and runs as part of the Aquatic Research and Environmental Assessment Center on the college's campus in Flatbush. And now that tilapia have become popular in restaurants and seafood stores, Dr. Schreibman's vision of widespread tilapia-farming in New York City may finally have a chance of becoming a reality.
 ''A few years ago, you mention tilapia and people's eyes glaze over,'' he said. ''Now everyone's talking about it.''
 In addition to appearing on menus, the fish can cure a variety of urban ills, according to Dr. Schreibman. Promoting urban aquaculture in New York City and setting up fish farms can help feed the homeless, ease environmental problems and provide jobs, he said. 
 He maintains that setting up a fish farm is simpler, less expensive and more profitable than one may think.
 ''You could set a tank up in your basement and grow enough fish to pay your rent,'' he said, noting that most tilapia are imported from South America and Asia. ''Why import fish from countries thousands of miles away when we can grow it all in-house?''
 Inside the lab, in a building called Ingersoll Hall Extension, are 14 large tanks, with capacities ranging from 300 to 900 gallons. Some hold other kinds of fish, like platy and swordtails, used for biomedical research, but most contain tilapia, a hardy and fast-growing breed popular with fish farmers. Water conditions are controlled carefully, with extensive filtration systems and computerized climate and chemical controls.
 Dr. Schreibman said that tilapia farming could become a thriving business in New York State, and that he hoped consumers would turn to the fish because of a recent study saying that farm-raised salmon had more contaminants than wild salmon. He would like tilapia farming to become associated with New York the way catfish farming is with Lousiana and salmon farming is with Maine. 
 Although he acknowledges that his plan is a pipe dream, it is gaining momentum. A ''Brooklyn Tilapia'' T-shirt is in the works. With help from Cornell University biologists, industry leaders, and local environmentalists and politicians, Dr. Schreibman is drafting a study promoting Brooklyn aquaculture to submit to city, state and federal officials.
 The plan calls for fish farms to be created at Brooklyn sites like Floyd Bennett Field, Coney Island, Red Hook and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and from these places the tilapia could easily be distributed locally.
 ''If we can just train the fish to swim to Fulton Street, we'd be all set,'' Dr. Schreibman said, ''but we don't have a gene for that yet. But at least you could get fish on the table that was swimming a couple of hours earlier.''
 Fish farming is not new in and around New York City. Until a few years ago, residents in Morris Park, the Bronx, bought tilapia from a small fish farm in the basement of a commercial building, and a small tilapia farm is tended by inmates in the Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, N.J.
 But Dr. Schreibman has grander dreams. ''I envision fish farms all over the city,'' he said. ''The city is losing out. We have to wake up and see this could be an economic boon. It could create jobs.''
 Fish farming also provides environmental benefits, he said, since species are less likely to be overfished in the wild. The farms could be used like culinary or hotel management schools, to train students to be fish farmers, he said, and to grow other types of fish for bait shops, pet shops and medical research. Farms could be built on a smaller scale, in basements of apartment or office buildings, he said.
 But not everyone shares Dr. Schreibman's vision of tilapia utopia.
 ''Growing our own fish in the city would be a wonderful thing, but is it economically viable, given the city's competitive disadvantage?'' asked Roger Tollefsen, president of the New York Seafood Council, an industry group based on Long Island. ''You have higher labor and utility costs than most other areas of the country. Tilapia can be farmed anywhere, and transportation has come down in cost. Why produce it in our own backyard if transportation advances can bring a better product to our front door for cheaper?
 ''Rather than give up on the ocean,'' Mr. Tollefsen continued, ''we should invest in cleaning it up, especially when the only thing we eat today that's not farmed is wild-caught fish.'' Dr. Schreibman said fish farming would complement, not supplant, the commercial fishing industry. 
 Before he settled on tilapia, Dr. Schreibman tried growing other types of fish. He experimented with flounder, but had a hard time working with saltwater tanks, and pike grew too slowly. Tilapia take about six months to reach market size.
 Tilapia, a freshwater fish also known as St. Peter's fish, was harvested from the Sea of Galilee and is thought to have been served at the Last Supper. It is the sixth most popular fish in the United States, after tuna, salmon, pollock, catfish and cod, said Kevin Fitzsimmons, secretary-treasurer of the American Tilapia Association. About 412 million pounds of tilapia were consumed last year in this country, up from 340 million in 2002, he said, and about 20 million pounds were raised in domestic fish farms.
 Since the college is prohibited from selling the fish, Dr. Schreibman donates hundreds of pounds at a time to a local homeless shelter. He also uses it to curry support for his tilapia dream, donating filets to political events and restaurant chefs, as well as to his students and colleagues and anyone who visits the lab.
 Dr. Schreibman grew up in Brooklyn, fishing off the Canarsie piers. He lives near the ocean, in Belle Harbor, a Queens neighborhood in the Rockaways. A graduate of Brooklyn College, he received graduate degrees from New York University.
 He said he began working with fish because ''I started with hamsters, but kept getting bit.''
 Dr. Schreibman has helped Israel set up fish farms in the desert, and has experimented with growing fish with enlarged ovaries, for caviar production. He has also cultivated seaweed for sushi and helped put fish in space, sending 200 swordtails to the space shuttle Endeavour in 1998 to study the effects of weightlessness on the development of their reproductive systems.
 A neuroendocrinologist, he studies environmental damage to the marshland and wildlife in Jamaica Bay and grows horseshoe crabs in the lab from fertilized eggs. His favorite time of the year is the week in spring when the crabs crowd beaches to mate.
 ''Have you ever seen them having sex?'' he said, smiling. ''It's incredible.''
 These days, very little of the fish eaten in New York City comes from the once-thriving fishing ports in the New York area, but if Dr. Schreibman has his way, New Yorkers will be liberated from the tyranny of imported seafood.
 While in Cuba to lecture on the benefits of a soy diet for farmed fish, Dr. Schreibman received an award, showing up to the formal ceremony in shorts and his ''So Many Fish, So Little Time'' T-shirt.
 ''They asked me, 'Didn't you know you'd be on the podium?''' he recalled. ''I said: 'What do I know? I'm from Brooklyn.'''

HEADLINE: A Burst of Excitement While Waiting for Football

BYLINE: By RAY GLIER

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 22 

 BODY:
The students have left for spring break, but the remnants of their celebration Sunday night hang in the trees on University Boulevard. The toilet paper blends in with the budding dogwoods and blows through the grass in Bicentennial Minipark on the University of Alabama at Birmingham campus.
 There does not seem to be a rush to clean up. Victories like this do not come along very often. 
 ''I've washed windows on 12 stores this morning and everybody is talking about it, 'How about U.A.B.?' '' said Bill Whitfield, a retired firefighter who owns a window-cleaning business.
 Whitfield wiped the suds off a pane of glass on a toy store and could not help but marvel over U.A.B.'s upset Sunday of Kentucky, the top-seeded team in the N.C.A.A. tournament. 
 ''We're back on the map,'' said Whitfield, whose daughter graduated from U.A.B. ''It kind of fizzled down after Gene Bartow left, but it's coming back. Basketball will still be something to do before football starts again in Alabama, but when you win, it's fun.''
 The fun seems to have spread all over town. The headline on the front page of The Birmingham News read ''UAB Shocks Kentucky,'' and radio talk shows trumpeted the compelling victory over the Wildcats in which the senior guard Mo Finley hit the winning shot with 12.2 seconds left. 
 The U.A.B. sports information office has received dozens of requests for interviews from news media across the country.
 Television cameras were set up along the court inside Bartow Arena late Monday afternoon for interviews with players and Coach Mike Anderson.
 Suddenly, the big news in town is not the spring depth chart for the University of Alabama or Auburn football teams.
 Maybe the ninth-seeded Blazers' run to the Round of 16 will help U.A.B. fix its identity problem once and for all. 
 It is not ''Alabama-Birmingham'' with a hyphen, but Alabama at Birmingham, or, as some people refer to it: the University that Ate Birmingham.
 The campus spreads over 75 blocks on the south side of the city. The east campus houses the medical school and biomedical research facilities. The west campus encompasses the traditional academic schools in arts and humanities and the sciences.
 U.A.B. has 16,357 students, and a university spokesperson said the economic impact on the city was $2 billion a year. 
 Birmingham, the city, has no identity problem. Blacks were defiant here against racism, and there are monuments, museums and parks dedicated to the fight against segregation laws.
 The city was also known as the ''Pittsburgh of the South'' because of the steel mills that sprouted up around the turn of the 20th century. When the mills started to close in the 1970's, U.A.B. was there to fill a void. The first presidents of the university were successful in the 1970's and 1980's in turning it into a thriving biomedical research school.
 The university is the largest employer in Birmingham, which has a metropolitan population of 850,000.
 The campus evolved to replace row houses where blacks lived, but university outreach programs like UAB HousingPlus helped develop newer, affordable housing.
 William Brown, a 56-year-old retiree who is African-American, said: ''This university treated people right, it does things for black people here. I think they are community-oriented. And black people love their basketball team.''
 One reason there is love for the team is Anderson, the 44-year-old African-American coach. He is from Birmingham and was an all-city guard at Jackson Olin High School in 1978. Anderson played at Tulsa for Nolan Richardson, his mentor. He coached at Tulsa and Arkansas for 22 years with Richardson before taking over at U.A.B. in 2002.
 Anderson is starting to build a following in just his second year.
 Few fans showed up early in the season for Anderson's Thursday night call-in shows at Full Moon, a barbecue restaurant near campus.
 ''Now the place is packed every Thursday night,'' said Scott Scharding, a physical education major from Birmingham. ''People love Coach. He's nice to all the students and stops and talks to us.''
 Bartow Arena seats 8,500, but U.A.B. has had trouble selling tickets. A Feb. 18 victory over Cincinnati was standing-room only at 9,312, but the Blazers, who tied with four other teams for the Conference USA regular-season title, averaged just 4,909 fans at home games this season.
 ''They don't get much of a following, even though they are the only game in town,'' said Tim Hobbs, who works during the day for a truck leasing company and attends accounting classes at night at U.A.B.. ''The students support it O.K., but the professionals in the city haven't followed it. It's not the S.E.C., it's Conference USA, so that's probably the reason.''
 Perhaps with a few more victories like the one over Kentucky, the fans will have more reason to pay attention to the other game in town.

HEADLINE: Slender and Elegant, It Fuels the Bomb

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
There was no breakthrough, no eureka, no flash of insight. It happened slowly, the advances gradual until what Dr. Gernot Zippe and his colleagues had invented was a compact, almost elegant device for collecting uranium's rare U-235 isotope.
 The feat might have remained obscure, except that it helped define the nuclear era: by the 1960's, Zippe-type machines had become the easiest way to make fuel for reactors as well as weapons of terrifying power, for lighting cities or destroying them.
 The invention was the uranium centrifuge, and around the world, millions of them now spin in high-security plants often ringed by barbed wire. 
 If a chief inventor has any regrets, he keeps them private. In a recent interview, he was philosophical about his team's brainchild, saying nations had the responsibility to determine whether the work would ultimately be judged good or evil.
 ''With a kitchen knife you can peel a potato or kill your neighbor,'' Dr. Zippe (pronounced TSIP-eh) said by phone from Munich, where at 86 he still works occasionally and flies off to international meetings. ''It's up to governments to use the centrifuge for the benefit of mankind.''
 And benefits there are. Nuclear reactors, with Zippe-type centrifuges often making their uranium fuel, now generate about 16 percent of the world's electricity. That figure may rise in the decades ahead as worries grow about global warming and oil shortages.
 But news of Dr. Zippe's invention has recently centered on the dangers of its illicit spread. Experts warn that it may put nuclear weapons into the hands of terrorists or states sympathetic to them.
 Last month, a Pakistani nuclear expert, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted running a vast smuggling ring that had supplied at least three nations with Zippe-type centrifuges. It appears to be history's worst case of nuclear proliferation.
 While nations congratulate themselves for exposing the network, private experts say the secretive centrifuge design at the heart of the illegal trade is still on the loose and the dangers of its misuse are far from over.
 ''It's small and you can procure the needed items in secret without being detected,'' said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, an arms control group in Washington. ''You end up with a small plant that's very hard to find.''
 The world may be in for an unsettling time if the future of the Zippe centrifuge is as surprising as its past. The tale of its development is full of striking twists, and no little sweat.
 ''It was very hard work,'' said Houston G. Wood, a centrifuge expert at the University of Virginia. ''Problems of great difficulty had to be solved.''
 Born and raised in Austria, Dr. Zippe studied physics at the University of Vienna in the 30's and served in the German Luftwaffe as a flight instructor and a researcher on radar and airplane propellers. In 1945, the Russians took him as a prisoner to a special camp for the technically adept.
 Moscow was desperate to catch up with Washington in nuclear arms. The hardest part was not the design but getting the fuel. Like all nuclear aspirants, Russia hoped to rearrange nature.
 The work centered on isotopes, forms of the same element whose nuclei have different numbers of neutrons. The most prevalent isotope of uranium, which accounts for 99.3 percent of natural uranium, is U-238, with 146 neutrons. It is ever so slightly heavier than U-235, which has three fewer neutrons and accounts for just 0.7 percent of uranium in nature.
 But U-235 is highly prized because it easily splits in two to produce bursts of atomic energy. When natural uranium is enriched to contain about 5 percent U-235, it can fuel nuclear reactors; to about 90 percent, atom bombs.
 The Russians put Dr. Zippe and other German prisoners of war to work making centrifuges to obtain the rare U-235 isotope. The Americans had tried, but had turned to other methods that were quite bulky, arduous and costly.
 The Russian team realized that uranium centrifuges would have to be linked up by the hundreds or thousands so that each could make tiny increases in the U-235 output, slowly raising the concentration. And to be economic and productive, the machines would have to spin continuously for years.
 Centrifuges are common devices in industry and medicine that spin fast to separate materials of differing masses -- for instance, blood cells from serum. Though they sound exotic, they are simple in principle. A washing machine on spin cycle is a centrifuge, its whirl creating artificial gravity that separates water (heavy) from clothes (light).
 A good washing machine spins about 15 revolutions per second. The Russians -- to have any hope of exploiting the minute differences in the masses of U-235 and U-238 in order to separate the nearly identical substances -- needed centrifuges that spun about 100 times as fast, near the speed of sound.
 ''Everybody was laughing and said, 'This will never work,' '' Dr. Zippe recalled. ''I was a young man. I had no idea how to do it. But I decided to do my best.''
 Among the 60 or so experts, Dr. Zippe, whose golden touch seemed to make mechanical things come to life, was soon appointed the team's lead experimenter. The general leader was Max Steenbeck, a physicist and former director of the German company Siemens.
 The overall plan was clear, if not the means: start with a hollow, cylindrical rotor. Fill it with gaseous uranium. At the rotor's bottom, use pulsating magnetic fields (much like those of an electric motor) to spin it fast enough to throw the heavier U-238 toward the wall, letting the U-235 accumulate near the center. Slightly heating the bottom of the gaseous mix would produce currents that would tend to move the U-238 down and the U-235 up, where scoops could gather the isotopes.
 To realize this ambitious plan, the team worked hard to defeat the main adversary of relentless spinning: friction, which can slow, cripple or destroy machines meant to work flawlessly for years. The rotor casing was evacuated to remove all air. A magnetic bearing was developed to hold the rotor's top steady, eliminating the need for physical support.
 Perhaps most important, the team let the rotor rest on a needlelike bearing. It was the only point of physical contact for the spinning assembly, a tiny concession to the material world.
 It took years of tinkering and experimentation. But the team finally got the complex devices to work.
 The Germans ''revolutionized the whole uranium fuel industry,'' said Pavel V. Oleynikov, a Russian historian of the postwar centrifuge effort.
 In 1956, Dr. Zippe was set free, and he returned to Vienna. He went to a meeting in Amsterdam in 1957 and was astonished to learn that the West lagged far behind his team.
 He decided to share what he knew. The Soviets had let him take no notes or reports. But as he recalled, ''I had it in my head.'' 
 Dr. Zippe flew to the United States and, under government supervision, set up shop at the University of Virginia. There, he managed to recreate the Russian centrifuge.
 Washington asked Dr. Zippe to join its secretive nuclear establishment and change his citizenship. He resisted. It was too reminiscent of his Soviet days. Instead, he wanted to use the invention for peaceful work, for enriching uranium for commercial reactor fuel.
 Flying back to Europe in 1960, Dr. Zippe worked in industry, especially in West Germany, joining the European postwar drive for nuclear independence from the United States.
 ''He was a little like Oppenheimer,'' said Mr. Albright, of the arms control group, referring to Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American atom bomb leader who managed to get stubborn experts to work together. ''He had a lot of help, but he was the real spark plug.''
 In the 1960's, Dr. Zippe and his associates managed to make the centrifuges even more efficient. They switched the rotor material from aluminum to the superhard alloy called maraging steel. That let the centrifuges spin faster, speeding the pace of enrichment without danger that the devices would tear themselves apart.
 The team also managed to make the rotors longer, which increased the collection of U-235. It took special joints known as bellows, which let the long centrifuge, like a plucked string, flex and bow safely as its speed increased. ''Ten times longer, ten times more,'' Dr. Zippe said.
 In the 1970's, Urenco, a new European consortium for making nuclear fuel, adopted Zippe-type designs. But its security for the potentially deadly technology was lax.
 Dr. Khan, the Pakistani expert, worked as a consultant at a Urenco plant and stole the designs. He used them in Pakistan to build centrifuges to make nuclear arms fuel and, as recently disclosed, later sold centrifuge plans and machines to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
 ''This is a very sorry story,'' Dr. Zippe said.
 A short man with a fondness for string ties and airplanes, which he piloted until he was 80, Dr. Zippe now divides his time between Vienna and Munich, where lives with a son. He says he still consults widely on technical issues, including centrifuges. ''If they need something,'' he said of responsible companies, ''I help them.''
 As for the future of the uranium centrifuge, many experts voice cautious optimism. Newer models are much harder to manufacture and less easily copied, especially illicitly. And the United States and its partners are still tracking down elements of the Khan network, insisting that the illegal traders will be put out of business.
 For his part, Dr. Zippe foresees benign possibilities even if his handiwork continues to spread clandestinely. During the cold war, he pointed out, nations with nuclear arms restrained themselves because they understood that the awesome destructiveness could become mutual. ''The reason America did not drop the bomb in Korea or Vietnam was fear that the Russians would retaliate,'' he said.
 Today, he added, small states want nuclear arms not necessarily for the sake of aggression or terrorism but to deter foes.
 ''Let's hope,'' he said, ''there's enough clever people not to use the bomb on people again.''

HEADLINE: Climate Debate Gets Its Icon: Mt. Kilimanjaro

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Kilimanjaro, the storied mountain that rises nearly four miles above the shimmering plains of Tanzania, is beginning to resemble the spotted owl -- at least in the way it has become a two-sided icon in an environmental debate.
 The owl first entered the spotlight 15 years ago, in fierce debate over clear-cutting of ancient Pacific forests. Millions of acres were placed off-limits to logging when the bird was listed as threatened under the federal endangered-species law. Soon afterward, effigies of it began showing up on the grilles of logging trucks.
 Kilimanjaro's majestic glacial cap of 11,000-year-old ice has long captured imaginations the world over, so it was not surprising that environmentalists focused their attention on it when scientists reported in 2001 that glaciers around the world were retreating, partly as a result of global warming caused by emissions of heat-trapping ''greenhouse'' gases from smokestacks and tailpipes. 
 Campaigners from Greenpeace, the environmental group, scaled the mountain in November 2002 and held a news conference via satellite with reporters at climate-treaty talks in Morocco. Last October, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is co-author of a bill to curb greenhouse gases, displayed before-and-after photographs of Kilimanjaro during a Senate debate. A British scientist proposed hanging white fabric over the glacier's ragged 10-story-tall edges to block sunlight and stem the erosion.
 But now the pendulum has swung. This month, the mountain was taken up as a symbol of eco-alarmism by a cluster of scientists and anti-regulation groups. ''Snow Fooling!: Mount Kilimanjaro's glacier retreat is not related to global warming,'' read a newsletter distributed on March 9 by the Greening Earth Society, a private group financed by industries dealing in fossil fuels, the dominant source of the heat-trapping gases. ''Media and scientists blame human activity, but a 120-year-old natural climate shift is the cause.'' 
 The group cited a paper in the current International Journal of Climatology asserting that Kilimanjaro's ice was shrinking because East Africa's climate is drying, a process that began more than a century ago, long before humans could have been an influence.
 The authors wrote that the dry weather both limited the snows that help sustain tropical glaciers and, by reducing cloud cover, allowed more solar energy to bathe the glacier. In dry, cold conditions, the ice vaporized without melting first, a process called sublimation. There was no evidence that rising temperatures had caused the melting, the researchers said. 
 So what do these researchers and the ones who first warned of glacial retreat have to say about the clashing public portrayals of their work on Africa's highest peak? 
 Almost unanimously, they agreed in interviews that the two depictions were wrong, turning what is still a complicated scientific puzzle into a simplistic caricature. 
 The authors of the new paper said their goal was to challenge what had become orthodoxy about the mountain -- that rising temperatures were eating away at the ice -- and to present an argument for a different mechanism. But their paper was hardly conclusive, they said. It was mainly a call for more study.
 ''We are entirely against the black-and-white picture that says it is either global warming or not global warming,'' said Prof. Georg Kaser, the paper's lead author and a glaciologist at the Institute for Geography of the University of Innsbruck, in Austria. ''As a scientist I'm happy it's more complex, because otherwise it's boring.'' 
 Other authors of the new study said they were particularly dismayed that the industry-supported group had portrayed their paper as a definitive refutation of the idea that melting from warming was involved.
 ''We have a mere 2.5 years of actual field measurements from Kilimanjaro glaciers, unlike many other regions, so our understanding of their relationship with climate and the volcano is just beginning to develop,'' Dr. Douglas R. Hardy, a geologist at the University of Massachusetts and an author of the paper, wrote by e-mail. ''Using these preliminary findings to refute or even question global warming borders on the absurd.''
 In short, Kilimanjaro may be a photogenic spokesmountain -- no matter what the climatic agenda -- but it is far from ideal as a laboratory for detecting human-driven warming. The debate over it obscures the nearly universal agreement among glacier and climate experts that glaciers are retreating all over the world, probably as a result of the greenhouse-gas buildup.
 ''These climate skeptics are making generalizations not only to the rest of the tropics but the rest of the world,'' Dr. Hardy said. ''And, in fact, global warming may be part of the whole picture on Kilimanjaro, too.''
 Most experts in the Kilimanjaro debate accept three things: for more than a century, its ice has been in a retreat that is almost assuredly unstoppable and was not caused by humans; so far, there is scant data on conditions there; and the main scientific question now is how, and how much, climate shifts driven by heat-trapping emissions are accelerating that trend. 
 Dr. Lonnie G. Thompson, the Ohio State University glaciologist whose work first focused attention on Kilimanjaro's fading ice, said he saw ample evidence that melting was eating away at what remained.
 His specialty is extracting cylinders of layered, ancient ice from tropical glaciers, and when his team drilled into one of the mountain's ice fields in 2000, water flooded out of the hole. In the resulting cores, shallow layers contained elongated bubbles -- strong evidence of melting and refreezing -- while deeper layers had none.
 More jarring was the violent collapse of a 10-story-tall clifflike face of one of Kilimanjaro's ice fields in January 2003, witnessed and photographed by trekkers. The collapse sent a huge cascade of ice and water gushing across the flanks of the ancient crater.
 ''This all suggests that what we are seeing at least in the last 20 years or so is different,'' Dr. Thompson said. He believes the mountain may be close to a threshold at which melting will become the dominant force eroding the ice. ''The balance of evidence says something bigger is going on in the system,'' he said.
 Dr. Thompson said that while the new paper selectively described evidence that drying of African air was the culprit, it did not test that hypothesis.
 Perhaps the long-term drop in humidity is to blame, he went on. ''But show me. Give me something I can see. Otherwise you raise important issues that need to be studied, and we need data on, but how do you know whether you're right?''
 Several independent glacier experts who have followed the Kilimanjaro research said the new paper and Dr. Thompson's earlier assertions about melting were probably both right to some extent. 
 But some experts see signs that something different has been happening in the region in recent decades. A bit to the north, for example, on the flanks of Mount Kenya, other scientists have been able to measure shifts in patterns of ice loss that show solar radiation -- the long-term influence on the ice -- is no longer dominating. 
 Unlike Kilimanjaro, whose ice is mostly oriented toward the sun, Mount Kenya has ice in shadow and sunlight. From 1899 to 1962, those ice fields more exposed to direct solar radiation ''wasted drastically'' while those in narrow, shaded grooves changed very little, said Dr. Stefan L. Hastenrath, a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, who is a longstanding expert on African glaciology. 
 This implied that changes in cloudiness and sunlight were the dominant force determining the fate of ice. ''But since the 1960's the mountain has seen more even loss of ice in shaded and sun-exposed ice,'' he said.
 The editor of the Greening Earth newsletter, Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, a University of Virginia climatologist, said he did not doubt that humans were altering climate. He just feels, he says, there is no sign that humans are pushing matters beyond the natural variability that already exists -- and already must be adapted to. 
 ''I've written a bunch of papers saying human beings are warming the planetary surface temperature,'' he said. ''It wouldn't surprise me that you'd see midlatitude glacier recession. The question is, Why is this alarming? Aside from the initial shock value of the notion that human beings can change the climate, why is this such a story?''
 But Dr. Thompson sharply criticized the newsletter's interpretation of the Kilimanjaro research. ''These people get paid to muddy the waters,'' he said. ''At least we're going out and trying to get the data, which is hard work. If you're going to sit in your office and send out your e-mails with no basis, I'm sorry, but that just doesn't carry the day.''

HEADLINE: Oh, Love That! You Paid What?

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
Liz Toney, a fashion stylist in New York, had hoped to buy a white lace Peter Som dress for herself this spring, but was stopped in her tracks by its price tag: $1,300. She was also scared off by the $400 price of another most-wanted item on her list, a hot-pink dress from Catherine Malandrino.
 ''Prices are definitely higher than they were a year ago,'' said Ms. Toney, who is in her 20's. ''Even with our economy getting a little better, these are not prices that I can afford. So I'm shopping less in the bigger stores and going instead to sample sales and places where I can get better deals.''
 Ms. Toney is typical of a breed of shopper who continues to shop but is troubled by a perceptible jump in the prices of designer goods, which are up as much as 10 percent over last spring, merchants say. Her dawning sense that something is amiss is being reinforced at cash registers across the country, where prices have been forced up by the dollar's shrinking value against the euro and by a general disconnect between the makers of high fashion and the economic constraints facing average consumers. 
 At stores like Bergdorf Goodman in New York, which specializes in European and American designer clothing, customers are experiencing price jumps of 6 to 7 percent, said Robert Burke, the store's fashion director. Other merchants reported increases of 10 percent or more since spring 2003, not enough to rock fashion zealots but enough to register. The ''moderate apparel'' category, encompassing the secondary lines of many designers, remains unaffected, for the moment at least.
 The 10 percent bump for designer goods -- more than five times the increase in the consumer price index for the 12 months ended in February -- is largely a result of the dollar's sharp fall against the euro. In mid-February, the euro reached $1.28, up from $1.05 in April 2003. Most high-end designer clothing comes from European factories or is made with fabrics from European mills.
 ''The bad value of the dollar to the euro is affecting everyone,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, fashion director of Bloomingdale's. ''Designers are very aware of the issue. They want their clothes to sell. They don't want to take markdowns. But neither do they want their customers to get sticker shock.''
 Retailers say that people are still shopping. High-fashion customers, affluent to begin with, seldom stop cold turkey when prices rise. They cope by buying fewer pieces, but more distinctive ones.
 Indeed, some stores, like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, are citing preliminary increases of more than 10 percent in spring sales of designer clothes and accessories, compared with this time last year, according to Women's Wear Daily. To explain the demand even in the face of rising prices, retail experts cite the success of designers in creating covetable spring clothes in bold patterns and colors like pink and orange, as well as a confidence among customers who are more optimistic than the economy might warrant.
 Come fall, however, those blithe shoppers may be stopped dead in their tracks. Fall designer clothing is expected to jump by 20 percent or more.
 Rose Clark, the vice president for merchandising at Stanley Korshak in Dallas, which caters to an affluent crowd, cited increases of 25 percent for European designer goods that will begin arriving in stores in late summer. Mr. Ruttenstein, who like Ms. Clark recently returned from a European buying trip, likewise noticed price jumps of 20 to 25 percent. Shoppers accustomed to paying $4,000 for a Chanel jacket at Bloomingdale's will find themselves spending closer to $5,000.
 Portents are already in the air. A stroll through Manhattan department stores last week turned up price tags that might cause even devout fashion followers to hesitate. At Bloomingdale's, a Celine cotton twill miniskirt bordered with brass grommets was priced at $1,050; Blumarine jeans in a white canvas much like the fabric used in jeans at the Gap were $630; and a Marc Jacobs cropped cotton seersucker jacket was $1,100.
 At Saks Fifth Avenue, a Michael Kors poncho -- little more than a square of patterned silk with a slot at the center to poke one's head through -- was marked at $890. And at Barneys, a plain sleeveless silk gingham camp shirt by Behnaz Sarafpour, an American designer little known outside fashion's inside circles, was marked at $690. A minuscule pair of oatmeal-color cotton shorts from Proenza Schouler, also far from a household name, was expected to fetch a staggering $720.
 ''We notice that our clients are purchasing less units -- about 10 percent less -- in designer clothes, but purchasing more expensive pieces,'' said Judy Collinson, the general merchandising manager of Barneys.
 Michael Silverstein, a fashion consultant and an author of ''Trading Up: The New American Luxury'' (Portfolio, 2003), said: ''Women in particular are still buying fashion, especially items that confer prestige. They're willing to put their money on certain pieces that telegraph luxury at 100 feet away.''
 Other experts cautioned that such assessments tend to be shortsighted. ''Perhaps designers are believing the press about the recovered economy and adjusting prices upward accordingly,'' said Candace Corlett, a principal at WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm in New York. ''They are pushing up prices in a way that is out of line with the economic reality that people's investments and savings have not grown, and are not going to grow dramatically.''
 Ms. Corlett added that consumers are aware that ''nobody has an inside track anymore on how to grow money fast.''
 ''Consequently,'' she said, ''many of them are pulling back on their purchasing.''
 To retain customers as clothing prices rise faster than inflation, stores find themselves forced to make concessions. ''We don't take as high a margin in some cases,'' Ms. Clark of Stanley Korshak said. In transactions with designers, major stores have the upper hand. ''Some companies we work with will take a lower markup,'' Ms. Clark said. ''It all depends. The question is, How badly does the company want to be represented?''
 American designers who manufacture domestically but buy their fabrics in Europe suffer because the cost of raw materials is up. Like stores, they are faced with the unpleasant choice of absorbing the increases or passing them on and running the risk of turning off consumers. Jamie Davidson, a partner in Normandy & Monroe, which sells cashmere jackets retailing for $1,200 at stores like Barneys and Neiman Marcus, said that European cashmere is up about 30 percent. ''But we have not raised our prices at all,'' he said.
 ''It's scary, to be honest,'' he added. ''Kind of like when there is a gas shortage and prices go up -- when world companies realize they can get a higher amount for gas, they're reluctant to bring it back down again. I hope that will not be the the case with the fabric mills.''
 Last week, Natalie Leeds breezed across the sixth floor of Saks in Manhattan, toting her handbag on one arm and a cream and yellow houndstooth linen jacket by Dolce & Gabbana on the other. An intrepid shopper long inured to the cost of high fashion, Ms. Leeds did not balk at the jacket's $3,000 price tag, murmuring resignedly, ''It is what it is.'' All the same, she confided that the price of spring fashions sometimes strains the limits of credulity. 
 ''I saw a white cotton T-shirt with a sequined neckline that cost $1,800,'' she said. ''Now I think's that's off.''

HEADLINE: Price of Gas Spurs Drive To Drop Rule On an Additive

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 22 

 BODY:
As gasoline prices continue to rise across the nation, New York politicians are pressing the federal government to relieve the state of one potential source of the soaring costs: the requirement that New York use ethanol as an antipollutant in its fuel.
 Democrats and Republicans are calling on Washington to waive the ethanol requirement, which has been in place since 1990 as part of the federal effort to clean up the nation's air. Gov. George E. Pataki has had an application for a waiver pending before the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal regulatory agency in charge of enforcing the mandate, for more than 18 months. 
 Environmentalists have questioned the effectiveness of the ethanol requirement, and the commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation says it is time for the rule to be scrapped. 
 Even the E.P.A. acknowledges that new technology can take the place of ethanol for purposes of complying with the federal Clean Air Act. 
 Yet the requirement stands, with federal officials saying they are still studying New York's request. 
 With gasoline prices expected to approach $2 per gallon this summer -- the result of many global and industry factors outside the control of state officials -- the move to do away with the ethanol requirement is taking on new urgency. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, said that next month, when refineries switch from winter gas blends to their summer ones, New Yorkers could see prices go ''through the moon,'' rising by as much 40 cents per gallon. 
 The senator said in a telephone interview that a recent report by the Energy Information Administration, a part of the United States Department of Energy, supported the idea that any potential price increases in New York could be linked to the ethanol requirement.
 Made from corn, ethanol is primarily produced in farm states in the Midwest. Coastal states have protested the requirement the loudest, saying they pay more for the additive because shipping the highly volatile substance is so expensive. 
 Some advocates for the change blamed the White House and political calculation for the lack of response from the E.P.A.
 ''This is pure presidential politics,'' said Peter M. Iwanowicz, the director of environmental health at the American Lung Association of New York. ''No one wants to tick off the farm states.''
 E.P.A. officials denied that charge. But advocates of the waiver pointed to California, which has been fighting since 2001 to get a waiver for the requirement, only to be turned down.
 Like New York, California was required to use oxygenates in its fuel under the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990. There were essentially two choices of oxygenates, methyl tertiary butyl ether -- also known as M.T.B.E. -- or ethanol.
 When it was found that M.T.B.E. was susceptible to leaking into the ground, contaminating the ground water supply and causing tap water to smell like turpentine, many states, including New York and California, banned the product. That left ethanol as the only alternative. New York's ban on M.T.B.E. went into effect in January.
 Advocates of the ethanol waiver, who conceded that pinpointing the cause of gasoline price increases was an inexact science at best, said that even the mere possibility of higher costs was enough to warrant waiving the requirement.
 According to the Energy Information Administration, gas prices are expected to reach an all-time high nationwide -- not adjusted for inflation -- of $1.83 per gallon by April. 
 As of March 21, New Yorkers were paying, on average, $1.87 per gallon, according to the consumer advocacy Web site NewYorkGasPrices.com.
 Mr. Schumer said that gas prices could rise well beyond the $2 mark if the waiver is not granted.
 Erin M. Crotty, the commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, said: ''The federal requirement for an oxygenate in reformulated gas is outdated and no longer necessary to reduce emissions from motor vehicles. The only way to protect both our environment and New Yorkers' pocketbooks is to end the oxygenate requirement.''
 An official at the E.P.A. in Washington, who insisted on anonymity because the debate over ethanol is so politically fraught, said, ''Oxygenates do help reduce vehicle emissions, but there are ways to achieve those results without oxygenates.''
 In the 14 years since the Clean Air Act was amended, the automobile industry has made innovations, such as better fuel injection systems, that have obviated the need for oxygenates, the official said. 
 Responding to the criticism that the E.P.A. was dragging its feet because of political maneuvering at the White House, the official said, ''The administration supported the language in last year's energy bill that would have eliminated the oxygenate requirement.''
 While the legislation would have gotten rid of the requirement, it did, in fact, call for a nationwide mandate that actually would have increased the amount of ethanol added to gasoline, not strictly for environmental reasons but as a way to stretch the fuel supply as well. Supporters of the legislation said it would help struggling farmers and reduce the nation's reliance on imported oil. The bill met stiff resistance from lawmakers in the coastal states and fizzled in Congress.
 When asked why, if the administration supports getting rid of the requirement in the energy bill, the E.P.A. does not just grant the waiver, the official said, ''The agency is evaluating the request.''

HEADLINE: Agencies Say Hunger on Rise Outside Cities Across Region

BYLINE: By ADRIENNE LU

 BODY:
Come payday, the tough choices begin for Roxie Jackson. Her salary as a physical therapist's assistant has sustained her family of five in the middle-class suburb of Bloomfield, N.J., since her husband lost his job two years ago and income from her second job, with Mary Kay, declined before she eventually left it. So each week, Ms. Jackson weighs which bills she must pay and which must wait. And one factor is ever-present in her budget deliberations: hunger. 
 ''My refrigerator and cupboard have been bare more than once,'' said Ms. Jackson, 35, who said that her home telephone has been disconnected since last year because she could not afford to pay for both utilities and groceries. ''It's still a struggle.'' 
 According to hunger experts and federal statistics, a growing number of suburban families are struggling to put food on their tables.
 Nationally, the rate of households facing limited or uncertain availability of food, what the federal government calls food insecurity, has been rising, reaching its highest point in four years. From 1999 to 2002, the latest year for which figures are available, the number of such households rose by about 15 percent, or about 1.5 million, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, bringing the number to just over 12 million. On the surface, hunger may seem more severe and more intractable in the hearts of the largest cities. But experts say that more and more people who live in suburban and outlying areas are also having to make hard choices that sometimes leave them scrambling for their next meal.
 Nationwide, the number of suburban households facing food shortages rose by roughly a quarter-million from 2001 to 2002.
 The number of people receiving food stamps in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York grew almost 11 percent in 2003 from 2002. 
 Hunger in the suburbs is far from a new phenomenon. But today, those showing up at suburban food pantries and soup kitchens throughout the metropolitan region are more likely than ever to include working families, experts say.
 ''There's a changing face of hunger, in the sense that more working people need help now than before,'' said Meara Nigro, a spokeswoman for the Community Food Bank of New Jersey.
 Charlene Nickle, 52, for example, has turned to the Human Needs Food Pantry in Montclair, N.J., where she lives, to help feed the three grandchildren she raises, who are 8, 10 and 14. Each week, she visits the pantry to pick up fresh fruits, vegetables and meats, when they are available, along with canned goods, rice, powdered milk and cereal.
 ''It really, really makes a great big difference in my food budget,'' she said.
 Before she took custody of her grandchildren in 1999, Ms. Nickle worked as a secretary. To take care of the children after school, she said, she quit her job and took a pay cut to become a home health aide. 
 Patty Dowling, executive director of Shoreline Soup Kitchens, which serves 11 coastal towns in Connecticut, estimates that 80 percent of her clients are working, mostly in low-wage jobs with no benefits. 
 ''There are all sorts of invisible people here that folks just refuse to see -- it could be gardeners, people living in the back of restaurants, lawn people, it could be the person working at the local grocery store who's making minimum wage,'' she said. 
 A few years ago, Maritza Rosa, was a single mother on welfare struggling to feed eight children. ''I know firsthand how it is to have food stamps run out and have no place to go,'' she said. ''It's either you pay a bill or you don't feed your kids.'' Now, Ms. Rosa works as the assistant director of the Father English Community Center Food Pantry in Paterson, N.J.
 Like many food pantries, Father English asks for identification and proof of income to verify that clients are truly needy. 
 In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, food banks -- which collect food from manufacturers and the Agriculture Department and distribute it to charities -- have reported an increased demand for food, particularly since 2001. 
 Lynn Needelman, executive director of Long Island Cares, a food bank on Long Island, said the demand is the greatest she has seen in her 17 years there.
 Experts agree that hunger in the United States is not typically severe to the point where people are suffering malnourishment, but some disagree about how serious the problem is. For example, a recent report issued by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy and research organization in Washington, concluded that nearly all hunger in the United States is short-term and episodic rather than continuous.
 But for some suburban residents, the reality is different. 
 Hunger relief groups throughout the New York region report helping people for longer periods as they wait through longer periods of unemployment, or are forced to take jobs that pay less than they once made, changing the nature of emergency food help. 
 Patti Perry, 40, lives in Montclair despite the high cost because she wants her seven children to be in good schools. 
 Ms. Perry, who is raising her children on her own, was laid off from her job with a telecommunications company at the end of February but has since been rehired in a different position. She makes ''a pretty decent salary,'' she said, but between bills and her monthly rent of $1,850 for a one-bedroom home that she has converted to four bedrooms, her paycheck never seems to go far enough.
 At first, Ms. Perry said, she was reluctant to go to the Human Needs Food Pantry. After all, she had a college education and a job. But that was 13 years ago.
 ''When I first started coming, I felt kind of funny, because we had to stand outside,'' Ms. Perry said. ''Now I'm just grateful for it.''

HEADLINE: Let a Hundred Russian Kilowatts Bloom

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: KHABAROVSK, Russia 

 BODY:
Recalling that Quebec powers New York and Paraguay powers Sao Paulo, Viktor N. Minakov tapped his pen on a map of Russia's Far East and spun a vision of this corrugated landscape helping power China, the 21st century's factory to the world.
 As power blackouts threaten China's industrial growth, China is increasingly looking north, much the way American power company executives first looked to Canada for power in the 1960's. Only 3 percent of hydroelectric power potential has been tapped in border areas of the Russian Far East, a mountainous region with a population density on a par with that of Maine.
 With new Russian laws allowing foreign investment in electricity generation, envoys from Khabarovsk, home to the regional power company, have traveled to Beijing recently, pitching proposals for Chinese financing of dams.
 ''In China, many powerful industries are going to lobby this year for importing electricity from Russia,'' predicted Mr. Minakov, director general of Vostok-Energo, the far eastern export arm of Russia's electricity monopoly, the Unified Energy System. ''Thirty percent of the factories we saw were stopped because they lack electricity,'' he said of a tour he took in January through a Chinese border province. ''They say they need one to two billion kilowatt hours annually -- and they are ready to buy it now.'' 
 Chinese planners had forecast 5 percent annual growth in electricity use last year, but, the actual increase was 15 percent. Northeast China is expected to exhaust its existing power generation capacity by 2010. (Similarly, oil consumption in China has tripled since 1980, while production has been flat.) 
 ''We expect our power sales to China to increase fourfold this year,'' Mr. Minakov said, forecasting sales of 600 million kilowatt-hours on a small line linking Blagoveshchensk, Russia, and Heihe, China.
 Studying the Northeast Asia wall map in his office here, he pointed to four other sites identified for high voltage lines that would send power from the Russian Far East, population seven million, to Northeast China, population 100 million. Another project would bring a line through North Korea to South Korea, an enclave of high electricity prices that would be the real economic prize for Vostok-Energo.
 If investment goes according to plan, he said, his company could be exporting to China and the Koreas a total of seven billion kilowatt-hours a year by 2010. According to figures from the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan, seven billion kilowatt-hours would cover Beijing's energy use for about 58 days. 
 Long term, this region could export to its neighbors in Northeast Asia 50 billion kilowatt-hours, twice the level of Russia's total electricity exports today, predicted Alexander Y. Ognev, an aide to Mr. Minakov who has taken Vostok-Energo's sales pitch in recent months to Japan, China and Canada.
 The company plans to complete by this fall a 1,000-mile, 500-kilovolt line that starts at the newly commissioned Bureya hydroelectric dam and ends outside Vladivostok, on the Sea of Japan.
 Aimed at eventually bringing Russian electricity to South Korea, the line features the tallest power pylons in Russia, 625 feet, and the wires jump the Amur River in two, one-mile-long spans.
 The price for reaching South Korea and its high energy prices would be to pass through North Korea. Analysts see this line as part of a wider international initiative that would let electricity go to North Korea in return for Pyongyang's bringing its nuclear weapons program under international controls. 
 To reach Japan, Northeast Asia's richest market, Vostok-Energo has proposed stringing underwater lines from a natural gas power plant on Sakhalin Island to the major Japanese population centers. But with Japanese per capita electricity consumption 10 times the level of North China's, the big growth in demand will be in China, where prices are about the same as in Russia.
 Financing is a big barrier to projects. Vostok-Energo has little money to invest, and there is little precedent for investment by foreign companies in Russian electricity.
 ''Russia will not lift a finger to send a kilowatt south unless someone finances it,'' said Peter Hayes, director of the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability, a California-based research group specializing in Northeast Asia energy. ''There is a substantial surplus of hydropower, but there is no financing at all at the moment. It is all conceptual.''
 Multinational companies have been lured by Sakhalin's oil and gas, embarking last year on a program to invest $1 billion a year for the next decade. That helped foreign investment in Russia jump 50 percent last year, to $29.7 billion. Energy analysts forecast that Russia's hydropower potential in the Far East will combine with China's looming shortages to attract foreign capital.
 According to Vladimir I. Ivanov, a Russian energy economist based in Japan, ''There are at least 10 hydropower projects that are economically feasible.''
 ''The potential is there,'' he said, ''but it requires long-term contracts and relationships.''
 Although Russian officials do not publicly link the two energy projects, sending electric power to China could ease China's anger if Russia decides to build pipelines that will bring Siberian oil and gas to a Russian terminus on the Sea of Japan instead of to China.
 In a telephone interview about electricity exports from Russia, Daojiong Zha, director of Center for International Energy Security at Renmin University in Beijing, said, ''The potential is good, this is clearly something that should be promoted, but we need someone to point the way out.''
 He Xin, an engineer with the State Grid Corporation of China, wrote approvingly in a paper last August: ''In order to satisfy energy demand in North China, natural gas or electricity can be directly transferred into the load centers in North China from producing fields and power plants in the Russian Far East if the electricity price is competitive and the investment is possible and valuable.''
 Prices, reliability of supply and technical standards all need to be sorted out, said Dr. Hayes, whose Nautilus Institute has held four workshops in recent years on creating a power grid in Northeast Asia, one of the regions in the world most dependent on imported energy.
 ''These systems require real-time control centers,'' Dr. Hayes said by telephone, recalling the blackout last August that cascaded through eight American states and Canada. 
 Alluding to the fact that Russia and China fought border skirmishes near here only 35 years ago, he added, ''In an engineering system, you have to create the kind of trust that allows you to react instantly to supply and demand.''
 Leaders of Russia's fledgling environmental movement argue that dams have already flooded thousands of acres of forest, bringing little benefit to residents of the Russian Far East. Bureya, the region's largest hydropower project, flooded 270 square miles of forest but has not brought down local power prices. Many rural dwellers living near the dam still cook with wood.
 ''We are not against all dams -- some middle-sized dams can be built in the gorges, but not in the lowlands,'' said Yuri Darman, director of the environmental group WWF Russia. ''The benefits should go for the local economy, and not for the world.''
 Perhaps mindful that damming Russian rivers to power Chinese factories is not a vote-getter, President Vladimir V. Putin on a visit to Khabarovsk two weeks before the March 14 election, spoke in favor of using locally generated power for local development.
 ''Consumers should be found for the energy facilities to be constructed,'' he told reporters here. ''This is what the Economic Development Ministry should be thinking about rather than about pumping natural resources out for export.''
 But a few weeks before the president's visit, Konstantin Pulikovsky, his envoy to the Russian Far East, was in Beijing talking to Chinese businessmen about investing to add turbines to the Bureya station.
 Mr. Minakov, meanwhile, is busy pitching the hydropotential on China's doorstep to any foreign investors -- Chinese, Japanese, European, or American. He said: ''If there is an interested company, we are ready to cooperate.''

Soaring Fuel Costs Hit Airlines Hard
 The good news airlines were starting to see as travel picked up this year is rapidly being overtaken by bad news, chiefly in the soaring costs of fuel and the fiercely competitive forces denying airlines the ability to raise fares to compensate for higher oil prices. 
 Last month, among the top 14 United States carriers, the number of planes taking off and the number of passengers flying were up 4.1 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, over February 2003 for domestic and international trips, according to the Air Transport Association. 
 But an important measure of airline finances, revenue per available seat mile, grew only 0.7 percent last month for domestic trips, according to data released yesterday by the airline trade group. That was less than stock market analysts had expected, and partly reflected a 9.4 percent growth in domestic seat capacity. Growth in capacity is likely to add extra downward pressure on domestic air fares.
 Airlines are anxiously watching crude oil prices. After averaging $20 a barrel from 1992 to 2001, crude oil rose to $26 a barrel in 2002, $31 a barrel in 2003 and prices for the first quarter of this year are projected to average $35 a barrel, according to John Heimlich, the chief economist of the Air Transport Association. Airlines are now paying ''double what the industry was paying in 1998 and 1999'' for fuel, he said.
 In an analysis released on Friday, Kevin P. Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, said that the major network airlines were most hamstrung by these forces because their high operating costs made them unable to generate enough profit in competition against the expanding lower-cost, low-fare carriers, which now account for about 27 percent of domestic traffic.
 The Business Travel Coalition has forecast a 4 percent increase in business travel this year. But much of that will be attributable to demand stimulation by low-cost carriers as they enter new markets and ''discipline major airlines' pricing,'' Mr. Mitchell said.
 He added that it was ''hugely unrealistic'' of major airlines to believe that their extensive route structures and frequent-flier benefits could justify to consumers fares that are 20 to 30 percent higher than those of low-cost carriers in directly competitive markets. 

Baseball Fans Will Like This Hotel
 Opening day looms for baseball fans, and the new Omni San Diego hotel has scheduled its own opening for April 7, the day before the San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants play the first game at the city's new ballpark, Petco Park. There's a reason for the nearly coinciding opening dates. The 511-room, $124 million Omni Hotels property is connected by a skybridge directly to the adjacent ballpark in the city's Gaslamp Quarter, and many of the rooms have views of the field.

Private Jet Operators Seek Return to Reagan
 Until Sept. 11, 2001, Reagan National Airport in Washington was a hugely popular spot for corporate jets, valued for its proximity to the capital from its location on the Potomac River. 
 Though other airports used by corporate jets and other forms of general aviation reopened to those segments after the terrorist attacks, Reagan has remained closed to them. The nearness to official Washington that gave Reagan value to private jets was also cited as the reason for keeping them away because of security concerns.
 Last week, the business jet and general aviation industries, which have been lobbying hard for a reopening of Reagan to them, sent representatives to testify at hearings by the House Aviation Subcommittee.
 James K. Coyne, president of the National Air Transport Association, told the committee that the continued closing ''unreasonably and unlawfully discriminates'' against corporate jets and charters, which he said were ''an arguably more secure mode of air transportation than the airlines, when considering the new security requirements imposed on them by the federal government.''

HEADLINE: As Prices Soar, Some in OPEC Balk at Cuts

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 22 

 BODY:
Some OPEC members are signaling their reluctance to proceed with announced cuts in production as crude oil prices have climbed to their highest level since the first gulf war. 
 Oil prices for May delivery eased on Monday after the members' statements, falling 57 cents, or more than 1.5 percent, in New York, to $37.05 a barrel. 
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled to discuss quotas at a meeting on March 31 in Vienna, but several representatives from member nations, including officials from Qatar and Venezuela, said they were hesitant to cut production significantly.
 The statements illustrate a widening gap between the group's official announcements and members' resistance to carrying out those policies -- particularly one to cut production when elevated oil prices are replenishing the finances of its 11 members. 
 Oil prices have climbed more than 15 percent since January, driving gasoline prices in the United States to record levels while producing budget surpluses in nations like Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest and most influential producer.
 OPEC said at a meeting last month in Algiers that it was planning to reduce production by one million barrels a day, a move that would lower the group's output to 23.5 million barrels a day. OPEC, which accounts for more than a third of global oil production, also called on members to adhere more strictly to previously established quotas.
 Neither policy appears to have been adopted by all 11 OPEC members as robust demand for oil continues in Asia, particularly China and India. OPEC cut production by just 150,000 barrels a day in March, according to data collected by Petrologistics, a company based in Geneva that tracks tanker activity around the world. 
 ''There's very little incentive to lower production when prices are at this level,'' said Julian Lee, senior energy analyst with the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. ''The market is simply tighter than OPEC and others had realized.'' 
 Strong demand for oil in Asia is one reason for higher crude prices in recent months, though analysts also said that aggressive bets by large commodity speculators have also contributed to the recent run-up in oil markets. Much of the attention on Asian oil supplies is related to the fast-growing economies of China and India.
 In India, sales of diesel fuel, which accounts for about 40 percent of the petroleum consumption in that country, soared 10 percent in February from the month a year earlier; automobile sales in India grew 31 percent in the last year. India's oil imports are forecast to continue to climb as its economy grows 8 percent this year. 
 Long-term forecasts also see rapidly growing demand for oil in the region. Oil demand in all of Asia is expected to rise to 38 million barrels a day by 2025 from 21 million barrels a day, with more than half of the new import demand coming from China and India, said Joseph Ferguson, director of Northeast Studies at the National Bureau of Asian Research in Seattle. 
 ''Much of the growth in China and India is taking place in urban areas where the need for transportation fuels is greater,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''It's hard to see a scenario where oil prices go back down to the low levels of the mid-1990's.'' 
 Faced with growing concern over the recent increase in crude prices, Saudi Arabia has been circumspect about its plans for next week's meeting. The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said in an interview over the weekend with Il Sole 24 Ore, an Italian newspaper, that he was not prepared to elaborate on whether OPEC would delay production cuts. 
 ''I don't know,'' Mr. Naimi said. ''At the moment no one is in a position to say.''
 Other OPEC officials have shown greater concern about the recent price jump. Some members are believed to be fretting about a repeat of 1997 and 1998, when oil fell to $10 a barrel after OPEC misread Asian demand. Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, Qatar's oil minister, told reporters in Doha, Qatar, on Monday that OPEC needed to ''stabilize'' prices to prevent a collapse.
 There are signs that some investors are already preparing for prices to decline, if not by much. Commodity speculators with so-called net long positions, or bets that prices will climb, trimmed those wagers for the second consecutive week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a report released last Friday. 
 ''The market has taken OPEC's statements at face value regardless of the facts,'' said Kyle Cooper, an energy futures analyst with Citigroup in Houston. ''It's about time to have a rigid reinterpretation of what OPEC says and what it does.''

HEADLINE: Stock Indexes Fall To Lows for the Year

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Weak job growth and renewed fear of terrorist attacks unnerved investors yesterday and sent stocks to their lowest levels this year despite reports of strong sales from Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer.
 Wall Street appears to be unusually divided. Many professional investors and strategists say that the recent sell-off has gone too far, arguing that the economy and corporate profit are growing rapidly and that low interest rates make stocks even more attractive compared with other investments. They predict a snapback as the fear of terrorism fades and companies report strong first-quarter profit.
 But a sizable group of skeptics contends that high energy prices, big budget and trade deficits, and weak job growth have put the economy and the market in a precarious position. Despite the recent decline, these people say, stocks remain overvalued and could fall as much as 10 percent more. 
 For now, the bears have the statistics on their side. With yesterday's declines, four standard market gauges -- the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the Nasdaq composite index and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks -- have fallen more than 5 percent from recent highs.
 It was the first time that the S.&P. 500 had fallen that much in almost a year. The Nasdaq, which includes leading technology companies like Microsoft and Intel, has dropped further, dropping more than 11 percent from its peak on Jan. 26.
 Yesterday, the Dow fell 121.85 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,064.75. The Dow, a gauge of 30 dollar-weighted blue-chip stocks, flirted with the 10,000 mark around 2 p.m. before rebounding slightly. Many traders can be expected to view a Dow close below 10,000 as a significant psychological breach, although a half-century of research shows that technical signposts like the 10,000 mark are essentially useless in forecasting stock price movements.
 The other major indexes also fell more than 1 percent. The Nasdaq composite dropped 30.57 points, or 1.58 percent, to 1,909.90, and is down 4.67 percent for the year. The S.&P. 500 dropped 14.38 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,095.40. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded those advancing by more than 3 to 1. Volume of 1.46 billion shares was virtually flat compared with Friday.
 Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, said investors were concerned that job growth is almost nonexistent even though economists date the end of the recession to more than two years ago and economic output has grown strongly since the summer.
 ''The stock market sell-off, if you look back in history, really started with the weak employment report for February,'' Mr. Harris said. ''It did raise the question of whether this recovery has staying power or not.''
 Much of the economy's gains in the last year can be attributed to very low interest rates and the federal budget deficit, which provide considerable stimulus to economic activity in the short term. But unless private businesses begin generating millions of new jobs annually, consumers will not increase their spending and growth will stagnate, Mr. Harris said.
 That prospect has some investors nervous, especially as companies move service jobs to countries like India, where labor costs are much lower than in the United States. ''There's a lot of talk about problems in the labor market that seem almost insoluble and very threatening,'' he said.
 In addition, Israel's killing on Sunday of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the militant Palestinian group Hamas, has left investors worried that the risk of terrorist attacks is rising. Recent high oil prices also have Wall Street worried. The price of crude oil has risen 38 percent in the last year, though it dipped a bit yesterday to $37.05 a barrel. Since the United States imports almost 10 million barrels of oil a day, that increase would translate into an additional $40 billion in spending on imported oil if it lasted for a year.
 ''Oil and higher gas prices are like a tax,'' said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at the Harris Private Bank in Chicago, which oversees about $40 billion. ''This is a pretty strong headwind.''
 The fact that the Nasdaq has fallen further than the S.&P. 500 in 2004 is another sign that investors are not sure that the economy can sustain its growth, analysts say. In a fast-growing economy, technology companies can have spectacular profit gains as corporate customers invest heavily in new equipment.
 But in an uncertain economy, corporations can quickly cut back on their technology spending, with profits at technology suppliers plunging. In that environment, the best-performing stocks are often those of companies whose products are less tied to the economic cycle, like drug makers, consumer product companies and utilities.
 ''In 12 weeks of trading so far this year, 9 of them have been negative on the Nasdaq,'' said Brian Belski, market strategist at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. ''What do you have leading the way? The best-performing sector is utilities and energy.''
 But Mr. Belski said he expected stocks to rally soon. Energy costs are a relatively small expense for most businesses, and the risk of a terrorist attack large enough to disrupt the United States economy is low. Investors, he said, should focus on economic fundamentals and corporate profits, both of which he said were very strong.
 The economy is likely to grow more than 4 percent this year, and average profit of S.&P. 500 companies is expected to be 15 percent higher this quarter than a year earlier. More impressive, analysts are raising their profit estimates for the current quarter instead of lowering them, as is typical in the weeks before a quarter ends.
 ''Economic fundamentals are too strong,'' Mr. Belski said. ''I think we're going to get a rally.'' He said he expected the S.&P. 500 to gain 11 percent to 15 percent in the next 12 months, with much of that coming in the next few weeks, as investors react to strong earnings reports.
 In a small piece of evidence that consumer spending remains strong, Wal-Mart said yesterday that its United States sales this month have increased as much as 6 percent, in part because of rising tax refunds. Such a sales gain is at the high end of the company's forecast.
 James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, is also bullish. As in the past, he said, the economy will reward investors who bet on its resilience. ''This job thing where the U.S. is never going to create another job again is going to be proven wrong,'' he said. ''And if it is proven wrong, the odds are good that there's going to be another rally, one that probably takes the S.&P. above 1,200.''

Treasuries Are Higher
By Reuters
 Treasury prices rose yesterday in reaction to retreating equities and as a Federal Reserve Bank president reiterated that the Fed was reluctant to raise interest rates. 
 The official, Michael H. Moskow, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in a speech stuck with central bank language in saying that policy makers could be patient in increasing rates from the current level, the lowest since 1958, and that worries of inflation were premature. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped 15/32, to a price of 102 11/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.71 percent from 3.77 percent on Friday. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 20/32, to 110 26/32. The bond's yield slipped to 4.67 percent from 4.71 percent on Friday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Taiwan Market Falls in Wake of Disputed Election

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 22 

 BODY:
The stock market dropped nearly 7 percent here on Monday following confusion over a disputed election on Saturday and the slight wounding of the president in a shooting on Friday afternoon. The sharp decline helped drag down markets across Asia and around the world.
 Stock market rules here limit price drops for each stock to a little less than 7 percent a day. So many stocks fell the limit on Monday that the Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange tumbled 455.17 points, or 6.7 percent, to 6,359.92. 
 To make matters worse, there were few buyers even after most stocks had fallen the limit. The volume of stocks traded was only a third of the usual volume. 
 The dearth of buyers even at sharply lower prices prompted equity strategists to predict that the market would continue falling on Tuesday, and possibly on Wednesday and Thursday.
 Political turmoil here and falling share prices helped pull down the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues in Japan by nine-tenths of a percent and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong by 1.9 percent. Some financial analysts even mentioned the troubles here as contributing to losses in European markets and in early trading in New York.
 Among the losers before the close in New York trading were Taiwanese companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest made-to-order computer chip producer, down almost 8 percent, and Chunghwa Telecom, the biggest phone service provider here, down nearly 7 percent.
 The business community here had mostly favored Lien Chan, the opposition Nationalist Party candidate in the presidential election. Mr. Lien favored closer relations with mainland China, where most large and medium-sized Taiwanese companies have significant operations, and had been ahead in most polls.
 But President Chen Shui-bian, who has taken a confrontational approach to relations with the mainland, was injured in a mysterious shooting on Friday afternoon, 15 minutes after the close of trading here. Public sympathy appears to have helped Mr. Chen as he defeated Mr. Lien on Saturday, 50.1 percent to 49.9 percent.
 Mr. Lien has refused to accept the loss, asking a court to order a recount as his supporters blocked a downtown thoroughfare in Taipei on Sunday and Monday.
 Peter Sutton, the head of Taiwan research at the CLSA investment bank, predicted that airline stocks in particular might fall the limit on Tuesday and Wednesday, before reaching by Thursday a level at which buyers might step in.
 Investors had bid up airline stocks in recent weeks based partly on polls showing that Mr. Lien had a slim lead. Mr. Lien had been expected to authorize direct flights between Taiwan and the mainland, which would have been a bonanza for air carriers.
 Travelers must now fly to other jurisdictions, usually Hong Kong, before catching flights to mainland destinations, a time-consuming and cumbersome routing that discourages nonessential travel.
 ''People thought they'd be able to set up businesses flying directly into China,'' Mr. Sutton said of the hopes for a Lien victory.
 James Carroll, the head of Taiwan equity research at ING, said that if many stocks fall the limit again on Tuesday, there would be many buying opportunities for investors. ''The Taiwanese tend to over-discount political developments,'' he said.
 Taiwanese officials said on Sunday that they have $3 billion available to steady the market if necessary. The government intervened in the stock market four years ago to reverse a sharp sell-off that followed the election of President Chen to his first term.
 But there was no sign that the government was intervening on Monday. Just as governments prefer to intervene in currency markets when the momentum of a currency's movement slows, officials in Asian markets like Taiwan and Hong Kong have preferred to wait for a time when their stock interventions might have the greatest effect.
 The New Taiwan dollar fell only a tenth of a percent on Monday, to 33.29 New Taiwan dollars for each American dollar. Later in New York trading, the New Taiwan dollar recovered some to trade at 3 United States cents. Economists said there was practically no chance of the Taiwanese currency coming under serious attack.
 Like China and Japan, Taiwan has been intervening actively in financial markets in recent months to slow the rise of its currency. As a result, it has accumulated enormous foreign exchange reserves that reached $224.8 billion last month.
 Taiwan also retains fairly strict capital controls on the transfer of money overseas. Because there is a limited supply of New Taiwan dollars outside of Taiwan, most of the trading takes place here, where Taiwan's central bank controls it very tightly.
 Because few countries have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, recognizing Beijing instead, and because Taiwan has few natural resources, Taipei has long pursued one of the world's most cautious currency policies, for fear of running out of money to buy oil and other needed commodities.
 Last autumn, the International Monetary Fund strongly criticized as wasteful the tendency of many governments, especially in Asia, to accumulate very large foreign exchange reserves. In an interview late last week, Fadah Hsieh, the vice chairman of the Taiwanese government's policy-coordinating Council for Economic Planning and Development, acknowledged that the size of the government's foreign exchange reserves meant that other opportunities to invest large sums were being passed over.
 ''We know that we have huge foreign exchange reserves,'' Mr. Hsieh said. ''We also realize that if we have too much foreign reserves, we don't use our resources efficiently, we are lending our resources to other countries.''
 The reserves here are believed to be invested mostly in United States Treasury securities.
 The cabinet has asked the central bank and other government institutions to study ways that the foreign exchange reserves might be used more efficiently, Mr. Hsieh said.
 But he contended that since Taiwan is not a member of the I.M.F. and cannot borrow from it, Taiwan needs especially large reserves as a financial cushion. Despite the government's intervention, the New Taiwan dollar had appreciated by close to 5 percent against the American dollar in the months leading up to the election.
 This has eroded Taiwan's competitiveness somewhat with mainland China, which has closely pegged its yuan to the American dollar.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Living

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your March 17 editorial ''The Cost of Cheap Money'' says ''there is no sign of inflation on the horizon.''
 Whatever parameters are used to measure inflation certainly don't apply to my household, where real estate taxes have increased nearly 10 percent a year for several years running, natural gas for home heating has doubled in a three-year period and medical insurance premiums and co-payments rise dramatically each year.
 Maybe the cost of food, clothing and appliances have remained steady, but the overall cost of living has risen far greater than the 2 percent or so that the government says is the adjustment factor used to determine inflation and Social Security payments.

HEADLINE: Shiite Ayatollah Is Warning U.N. Against Endorsing Charter Sponsored by U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 22 

 BODY:
Iraq's most influential Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has warned of ''dangerous consequences'' if the United Nations endorses the American-sponsored interim constitution for an independent Iraq that was adopted over Shiite protests two weeks ago.
 The warning came in a letter released by Ayatollah Sistani's office on Monday, four days after it was delivered in New York to Lakhtar Brahimi, the chief United Nations envoy to Iraq. It amounted to a warning that the ayatollah's followers, by far the most powerful political bloc in Iraq, could move to paralyze American plans for a smooth transfer of sovereignty on June 30 unless Shiite terms for changing the interim constitution were met.
 Ayatollah Sistani warned in his letter that he would boycott a coming visit to Baghdad by Mr. Brahimi, refusing to ''take part in any meetings or consultations'' conducted by him or his emissaries, unless the United Nations offered guarantees that it would not endorse the interim constitution. 
 After nearly a year of discounting the value of a United Nations political role in Iraq, the Bush administration shifted its position recently, saying it strongly favored the United Nations having a part in helping to establish an interim government and organize elections. 
 Mr. Brahimi, a former foreign minister of Algeria, is to arrive here late this month or early in April to help broker the talks on a transitional government and election arrangements. But Shiite groups that accept Ayatollah Sistani as their ultimate political arbiter have said they will use negotiations over the interim authority -- blocking agreement, if necessary -- to expand the Shiite majority's powers before an elected government takes over at the end of 2005. 
 The Sistani letter was the latest move in a complex game of maneuvers with the American occupation authority and the United Nations. As the political timetable here shortens, the ayatollah has appeared to oscillate between ultimatums that stop just short of threatening to provoke public disorder and conciliatory moves encouraging hopes of the Americans that he will in the end prove an ally in their push for a peaceful transfer.
 After Shiite leaders on the American-appointed advisory body, the Iraqi Governing Council, agreed earlier this month on an interim constitution that included elaborate minority guarantees, they staged a last-minute boycott of a signing ceremony. It was an effort to force a scaling-back of the blocking powers granted to minorities, particularly Sunni Muslims and Kurds, who are fearful of Shiite domination. After talks with Ayatollah Sistani's aides at his headquarters in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, the Shiite leaders signed the new charter, only to recant immediately after the ceremony by again denouncing the minority guarantees. 
 As he has with the Americans, the ayatollah has played hot and cold with the United Nations, signaling only a week ago that he favored its participation in the talks on an interim government and elections, then backtracking with his letter to Mr. Brahimi. His moves have kept senior American officials here on tenterhooks, uncertain how far he is prepared to go to realize his demands -- and unsure of what they will do if Shiite demands lead to an impasse that threatens to leave Iraq with no government capable of taking over authoritatively on June 30.
 Ayatollah Sistani's warnings to Mr. Brahimi were stark. The interim constitution, he said, ''enjoys no support among most of the Iraqi people,'' -- meaning the Shiites who account for about 60 percent of the 25 million people -- and ''confiscates the rights'' of the national assembly that is scheduled to be elected by Jan. 31 next year to draw up a permanent constitution. Because of that, he said, the elections he has persistently demanded -- for the assembly, for the constitution it will draw up, and ultimately for a permanent government -- ''become useless.''
 The cleric said he feared that the United Nations Security Council resolution he had demanded as an international guarantee of elections could be expanded to endorse the interim constitution, ''obliging the Iraqi people to abide by it against their will.''
 He added, ''We warn that such a step would be unacceptable to the majority of the Iraqi people, and would have dangerous consequences in the future.'' He offered no elaboration on what those consequences might be.
 American officials have played down the possibility that the maneuvering here could descend into open conflict, or even civil war, saying American powers that will remain after June 30 will be enough to ensure stability. One top official told reporters on the weekend that the interim constitution would matter less in the 18 months before there was an elected government than the competence and honesty of the individuals appointed to head the ministries.
 But that, too, the official acknowledged, has been giving the Americans cause for unease. The official said the Iraqi groups on the Governing Council had submitted names for more than 80 deputy minister positions -- jobs, the official said, that would be crucial to the government's efficiency. Of the names submitted, he said, about 50 were people with no known qualifications other than their political affiliations.
 The official said L. Paul Bremer III, the chief of the American occupation authority, had ''put a stop'' to the Iraqi machinations, and had demanded that the council members provide career histories of each nominee. ''What we'll do is create a professional, uncorrupt administration,'' the official said, and trust that Iraqis appointed to head the ministries, not the details of the interim constitution, will prove decisive in keeping the country stable.

2 Finns Killed in Baghdad
 BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 22 (AP) -- Gunmen killed two Finnish businessmen as they drove in Baghdad on Monday, the latest foreign civilians to die in Iraq. In the southern city of Basra, 14 British soldiers were wounded in two explosions during a demonstration.
 British soldiers fired tear gas at about 500 unemployed Iraqi civilians protesting a failure to get jobs with the local customs police, said Col. Zafer Abdel-Nabi, the chief of Basra customs. The crowd threw stones, gasoline bombs and a grenade at troops; six civilians were wounded, he said.

HEADLINE: One Nation, Enriched by Biblical Wisdom

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Tomorrow the Supreme Court will hear arguments about whether it is constitutional for public school teachers to lead the Pledge of Allegiance, including the phrase ''one nation under God,'' in their classrooms. So tonight's reading assignment is ''A Stone of Hope'' by David L. Chappell.
 ''A Stone of Hope'' is actually a history of the civil rights movement, but it's impossible to read the book without doing some fundamental rethinking about the role religion can play in schools and public life. 
 According to Chappell, there were actually two camps within the civil rights movement. First, there were the mainstream liberals, often white and Northern. These writers and activists tended to have an optimistic view of human nature. Because racism so fundamentally contradicted the American creed, they felt, it would merely take a combination of education, economic development and consciousness-raising to bring out the better angels in people's nature. 
 The second group, which we might today call the religious left, was mostly black and Southern. Its leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr., drew sustenance from a prophetic religious tradition, and took a much darker view of human nature. 
 King wrote an important essay on Jeremiah, the ''rebel prophet'' who saw that his nation was in moral decline. King later reminded readers that human beings are capable of ''calculated cruelty as no other animal can practice.'' He and the other leaders in the movement did not believe that education and economic development would fully bring justice, but believed it would take something as strong as a religious upsurge. Because the experiences of the Hebrew prophets had taught them to be pessimistic about humanity, the civil rights leaders knew they had to be spiritually aggressive if they wanted to get anything done. 
 Chappell argues that the civil rights movement was not a political movement with a religious element. It was a religious movement with a political element.
 If you believe that the separation of church and state means that people should not bring their religious values into politics, then, if Chappell is right, you have to say goodbye to the civil rights movement. It would not have succeeded as a secular force. 
 But the more interesting phenomenon limned in Chappell's book is this: King had a more accurate view of political realities than his more secular liberal allies because he could draw on biblical wisdom about human nature. Religion didn't just make civil rights leaders stronger -- it made them smarter.
 Whether you believe in God or not, the Bible and commentaries on the Bible can be read as instructions about what human beings are like and how they are likely to behave. Moreover, this biblical wisdom is deeper and more accurate than the wisdom offered by the secular social sciences, which often treat human beings as soulless utility-maximizers, or as members of this or that demographic group or class. 
 Whether the topic is welfare, education, the regulation of biotechnology or even the war on terrorism, biblical wisdom may offer something that secular thinking does not -- not pat answers, but a way to think about things.
 For example, it's been painful to watch thoroughly secularized Europeans try to grapple with Al Qaeda. The bombers declare, ''You want life, and we want death''-- a (fanatical) religious statement par excellence. But thoroughly secularized listeners lack the mental equipment to even begin to understand that statement. They struggle desperately to convert Al Qaeda into a political phenomenon: the bombers must be expressing some grievance. This is the path to permanent bewilderment.
 The lesson I draw from all this is that prayer should not be permitted in public schools, but maybe theology should be mandatory. Students should be introduced to the prophets, to the Old and New Testaments, to the Koran, to a few of the commentators who argue about these texts. 
 From this perspective, what gets recited in the pledge is the least important issue before us. Understanding what the phrase ''one nation under God'' might mean -- that's the important thing. That's not proselytizing; it's citizenship.

PERSON: Irving Crespi

HEADLINE: Irving Crespi, 77, Poll Expert Long Associated With Gallup

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
Irving Crespi, a public opinion pollster, professor and market researcher long associated with The Gallup Organization and the author of books on polling, public opinion and democracy, died on Thursday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 77.
 He had had several minor strokes since 1997, his wife, Joan, said.
 In ''Pre-election Polling: Sources of Accuracy and Error'' (Russell Sage, 1988) Dr. Crespi assessed the factors that increase or decrease the predictive power of polls before elections. In the process he codified methods that had mainly been an oral tradition of pollsters' lore. 
 Dr. Crespi joined Gallup as vice president in 1958 and was executive vice president from 1970 to 1976. He held subsequent research positions at Mathematica Policy Research, the Roper Organization, the Total Research Corporation, and Irving Crespi & Associates and also taught at Baruch College.
 He served as president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research in 1976-77 and received its award for distinguished achievement in 1997. Dr. Herbert Abelson, another past president, called Dr. Crespi ''a very scholarly person working in a commercial setting'' who ''helped bridge the gap between academic and commercial researchers and brought the field closer to a genuine profession.'' 
 Dr. Crespi also served as president of the World Association for Public Opinion Research.
 Dr. Crespi was born in Brooklyn on May 8, 1926, and graduated from the City College of New York before earning a master's degree from the State University of Iowa and a Ph.D. from The New School for Social Research. He served in an Air Force intelligence unit in the Korean War, then taught sociology at New York colleges before joining Gallup.
 Dr. Crespi was a polling consultant for The New York Times in 1982 and 1983.
 In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Judith Lofton of Skippack, Pa.; a son, Robert J., of New York City; and three grandchildren.

Little about the suburbs of Minnesota's Twin Cities fits the popular image of a struggling Midwestern swing state in this election year.
 Downtown Maple Grove, filled with shops and brick sidewalks, has sprung from virgin fields in just the last five years, and the medical-device maker that is the city's largest employer continues to add dozens of new workers. On the outskirts of the metropolitan area, some old farms are now worth $1 million, thanks to commuters looking for new places to live.
 Here in Minnesota and in many other swing states, the economy is a good bit healthier than it might seem when the spotlight in the 2004 presidential campaign focuses on the plight of industrial states like Ohio and West Virginia. 
 With the help of military spending in New Mexico, housing booms in Florida and Nevada and the growth of white-collar work in Minnesota and Iowa, the 17 swing states where President Bush and Senator John Kerry have aimed their early advertising have actually added 80,000 jobs over the last year. The rest of the country has shed 60,000 in the same time, according to an analysis by Economy.com, a research company, for The New York Times. Incomes in the swing states are growing a little faster than they are elsewhere. 
 But few people in the suburbs of Minneapolis seem in a mood to celebrate.
 ''Everybody's edgy; they're worried if they're going to be working next month,'' said Allan A. Schroeder, the deacon of St. Mark's, a Catholic church for 1,500 families in Shakopee, a conservative Minneapolis suburb. ''Nothing's sure anymore.''
 These crosscurrents have created an economic situation unlike that faced by candidates in other recent presidential elections. While the economy is a good bit healthier than it was when voters turned President Bush's father out of office in 1992 or did the same to Jimmy Carter in 1980, an uneasiness among some voters has allowed Mr. Kerry to make the economy a centerpiece of his campaign.
 For the first time since Mr. Bush took office, interviews and polls suggest that many Americans have begun worrying that the last few years of mediocre growth are more than simply a pause before the economy returns to the good times of the 1990's. After remaining impressively optimistic about the economy in the last two years, people now report being less confident than they were when Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton won re-election, according to two closely watched national surveys.
 In Iowa, ''the unemployment rate is below the national average,'' said Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat. ''Farm prices are stronger than they've been in a while. The problem is that people feel a sense of insecurity which is directly linked to the fact that we're going through a transition.''
 Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a Republican, said: ''It appears like we have turned a corner in Minnesota. But I think people still feel some anxiety.''
 In recent weeks, Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry have both visited the struggling manufacturing belt that stretches from western Pennsylvania to Michigan to describe their economic plans. 
 In the best case for Mr. Bush, job growth would pick up further in many of the swing states, helping his effort to keep Florida, Nevada and New Hampshire in his column come November and perhaps to add Iowa, Minnesota or New Mexico, three states Al Gore won narrowly in 2000. That could offset the possible loss of Ohio or West Virginia, whose economies are still lagging. Mr. Bush won both last time.
 ''It is a very compelling case to continue the economic policies where the benefits are obvious,'' said Terry Holt, a spokesman for Mr. Bush's campaign. ''In places where the economy has not caught up, we're going to have to make the case that going backwards is not the solution.''
 Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Kerry's spokeswoman, said that even in states where the economy was stronger than the national average, ''there's still a sense we could be doing better.'' She added, ''There's nothing that indicates the direction of this nation is going to get better under this administration.''
 The suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which tilt Republican and which Mr. Bush will probably need to win handily to take the state, expose this year's unusual economic dynamic. 
 In Maple Grove, 15 miles northwest of Minneapolis, the biggest reason for optimism is the series of low-slung buildings, on a hillside just off the highway, that loom over Applebee's and Fuddruckers restaurants. Inside the buildings and another nearby, Boston Scientific employs about 3,300 people, up from about 2,300 a year ago, who help design and build devices known as stents, designed to keep people's hearts pumping.
 In a sprawling, well-lit room, workers -- most of them lacking a college degree -- assemble stents while wearing white gowns, hats and gloves. Paying $10 to $14 an hour, these jobs are the type of semi-skilled work disappearing from many places in the country. 
 Boston Scientific also plans to add hundreds of research jobs over the next few years, many paying $80,000 a year and up.
 ''The economy in Minnesota is better than it was a year ago,'' said Barry Cool, a research manager, who received a 10 percent raise when Boston Scientific hired him away from a small drug company late last year. ''The downside is past us, at least I hope it is,'' said Mr. Cool, 41, who plans to vote for Mr. Bush.
 Minnesota has the longest current streak of voting for Democrats in presidential elections, dating to 1976, but it is hardly a safe state for Mr. Kerry. Mr. Gore beat Mr. Bush by just two percentage points here in 2000, and the governor, one United States senator and the majority in the state's House of Representatives are Republican.
 But in spite of low interest rates, rising house prices and slowly increasing employment, some of the president's supporters are less enthusiastic about him this time around. They say they are disappointed that the Bush administration's predictions of a strong recovery have not come to pass and that the 90's boom feels more and more distant.
 Kenneth J. Pucel, a group vice president at Boston Scientific, voted for Mr. Bush in 2000 and is leaning toward doing so again. But he is ''not happy about it,'' he said, and wishes that Mr. Bush would agree to a series of monthly debates, as Mr. Kerry suggested, so voters can better understand the candidates' plans.
 ''We've got to see real job growth for the economy to be a plus,'' said Mr. Pucel, 38. If the stock market falters, despite generally good news from corporate America, the economy will become a drag on Mr. Bush's campaign, Mr. Pucel said. 
 Some surveys suggest it has become a drag already. In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, 54 percent of Americans said they disapproved of the president's handling of the economy, a higher portion than gave that answer throughout 2002 and early 2003. 
 ''People have become much more pessimistic about employment growth in the year ahead,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan, which does a monthly consumer-confidence poll. ''They don't expect this to be a cyclical problem. They expect it to continue.''
 Weighing on people's minds, Mr. Curtin said, are the outsourcing of jobs to other countries and the increased efficiency of companies, which lets them do more with less.
 The concerns are evident at St. Mark's, the Shakopee church, which has a six-foot-high sign reading, ''Pray to Protect Human Life'' on the corner of its property.
 Mr. Schroeder, the deacon, said he had voted for Mr. Bush in 2000 because of his opposition to abortion but did not expect to do so again, out of frustration with the economy. The Rev. Bill Stolzman, the church's pastor for 15 years, said many parishioners felt more conflicted today than they did four years ago.
 ''There's a lot of fear,'' Father Stolzman said. ''Every family today has to be a two-income family, and if one of them loses a job, they can't make it.''
 Still, public opinion polls and hard economic data show Mr. Bush facing a far better economic picture than his father did a dozen years ago or than Mr. Carter did in 1980. 
 By many measures -- like inflation, home values and household income -- the economy is healthier today than it was at most points over the last 35 years. To many people, however, it now seems to have been going in the wrong direction for a few years, and the extent to which they blame Mr. Bush could determine the election, pollsters and elected officials say.
 ''It's not 'morning in America' by any means,'' said Senator Mark Dayton, a Minnesota Democrat. But, he added, ''people just have mixed views. It's not cut and dried one way or the other.''

HEADLINE: 3 Judges Criticized for Being on Advocacy Group's Board

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
Three federal appellate court judges violated judicial ethics by serving on the board of an environmental research and advocacy group partly financed by the energy industry and conservative foundations, according to a report issued yesterday by a public interest law firm that often defends environmental regulations.
 The firm, Community Rights Counsel of Washington, said it would file ethics complaints against the judges today, and it provided news groups with advance copies of the complaints, which are to be filed with the courts of the three judges.
 The judges serve on the board of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment, which says it supports sensible environmental regulation informed by cost-benefit analysis and respect for property rights. Critics maintain that the foundation is opposed to most environmental regulations. 
 The foundation, known as FREE, has attracted attention for paying the expenses of federal judges who attend seminars it sponsors at resorts in Montana and elsewhere.
 Judge Jane R. Roth, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, and is one of those cited in the report, said her service was appropriate.
 ''My participation on the board has convinced me,'' Judge Roth said, ''that this is not a partisan organization but a foundation very interested in presenting pertinent information.'' 
 Judge Danny J. Boggs, the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, who was also cited, compared his service to serving on a bar association or university group that sponsors judicial seminars. 
 Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the third person named in the report, did not respond to a detailed message seeking comment. Judges Boggs and Ginsburg were appointed by President Ronald Reagan; Judge Roth was appointed by the first President George Bush.
 Experts in judicial ethics questioned the judges' membership on the foundation's board.
 ''A judge should not sit on the board of a group like FREE or any other group with a strident ideological profile on issues of a kind that come before the court,'' said Stephen Gillers, vice dean of the New York University School of Law.
 John A. Baden, the foundation's chairman, said the group was nonpartisan. He added that its board members were not compensated and that judges on the board did not participate in fund-raising.
 ''We look for people whose interests coincide with ours, which are the promotion of the conjunction of environmental quality, responsible liberty and modest prosperity,'' Mr. Baden said.
 The Code of Conduct for United States Judges allows judges to ''participate in civic and charitable activities that do not reflect adversely upon the judge's impartiality.'' Monroe H. Freedman, a law professor at Hofstra University, said service on the foundation's board was hard to square with the code.
 ''It is improper for a judge to sit on the FREE board,'' Professor Freedman said. ''It's an advocacy group. If he's on the board, he's got a fiduciary obligation to serve their interest. That's inconsistent with his judicial obligations.''
 About 5 percent of all federal judges attend a FREE seminar each year, the foundation said. The report estimated the cost of each trip at $10,000. Mr. Baden disputed that, saying that the average travel and lodging expense per judge last year was about $1,300 and that judges paid for their own recreational activities.
 The report also criticizes a lawyer who briefly served on the foundation's board. That lawyer, Edward W. Warren, of the Washington office of Kirkland & Ellis, joined the board while an important environmental case in which he was lead counsel for an industry group was pending in the federal appeals court in Washington.
 Mr. Warren resigned soon after a panel of the court ruled in his favor, in May 1999, in a 2-to-1 decision joined by Judge Ginsburg. The full appeals court declined to rehear the case that fall, and the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the panel decision in 2001.
 In a statement, Kirkland & Ellis said Mr. Warren attended one meeting in July 1999, then resigned upon learning that Judges Ginsburg and Boggs were on the board. Mr. Warren, the statement read, ''decided that it would be better if he didn't serve on the FREE board because of perceived ethical concerns.''
 Mr. Baden defended Mr. Warren's service with Judge Ginsburg, saying: ''I don't see anything unusual with them both being on our board. To characterize them as somehow creatures or captives of some special interests is insulting.''

HEADLINE: New Exchange Spotlights Parties' Tug of War Over Fiscal Responsibility

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
Over the past 10 years, almost nothing has stirred as much resentment or long-simmering partisan warfare as the federal budget. Now the Bush forces have begun a rough new chapter in that struggle with a campaign intended to cast Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the presumptive Democratic nominee, as a classic tax-and-spend Democrat.
 And the Democrats can barely contain their fury. 
 In news conferences, e-mail messages and demonstrations on Monday, Democrats attacked what they called the hypocrisy of the Bush administration. After all, they asserted, this administration inherited a surplus, enacted sweeping tax cuts and produced a deficit that could reach a record $500 billion this year. 
 Republicans, for their part, continued to press their case that ''if Senator Kerry were elected president, you'd see a lot more spending and a lot more taxes,'' in the words of Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, and chairman of the budget committee.
 Even as Republican leaders were laying out this line of attack against Mr. Kerry, Democratic demonstrators appeared outside the Republican Party headquarters on Monday afternoon and chanted that the deficit that had grown under Mr. Bush was ''Bad for you; bad for kids and families, too!''
 After spending the 1990's trying to build their party's image of fiscal responsibility -- often at great political cost -- Democrats were clearly not about to cede it now.
 ''This president has got the worst record on fiscal matters of any president in the history of the United States,'' said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, one of many Democrats who went to the barricades on Monday.
 ''He's engaged in wholesale concoction'' about Mr. Kerry's record, Mr. Conrad added. ''It reflects desperation more than anything else.''
 His counterpart on the House Budget Committee, Representative John Spratt of South Carolina, called Mr. Bush's attacks on Mr. Kerry ''a diversionary tactic, setting up a straw man and knocking it down.''
 Republicans said they had simply added up Mr. Kerry's promises on the campaign trail, then subtracted the money he would raise by repealing the Bush tax cuts on people who make more than $200,000 a year to produce a net total -- what they call a ''$1 trillion tax gap.'' The Republican National Committee posted a ''spendometer'' on its Web site making the same point.
 The implication of the gap was flatly stated by Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Budget Committee, who said of Mr. Kerry, ''He must have a secret tax increase planned.''
 Democrats quickly challenged the Republicans' math. Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser in the Clinton administration who now advises Mr. Kerry, said that if the same methodology was applied to Mr. Bush, he would face a far greater gap. Just considering Mr. Bush's promise to create private investment accounts in Social Security, Democrats argued, would add as much as $2 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.
 The debate -- in some ways, the first budget debate of the general election campaign -- showed the two parties unwilling to give an inch. Republicans were intent on pinning Mr. Kerry into the box of big-spending, tax-raising liberal. Democrats were just as intent on pushing back.
 ''Kerry has been crystal clear that he would only roll back tax cuts on those making over $200,000 a year,'' Mr. Sperling said. ''Everything you're hearing from the Republicans is aimed at one big distortion: to convince the other 98 percent that they're going to get a tax increase.''
 Meanwhile, after sustaining two weeks of attacks from President Bush, Kerry campaign officials said Monday that they would try to refocus their campaign, starting with an advertisement reminding voters of Mr. Kerry's Vietnam War experience and promising a new direction and focus on domestic issues.
 The spot, to appear in 17 tossup states starting on Tuesday, begins with footage of Mr. Kerry as a young sailor traversing the jungle in Vietnam before switching to the present-day Mr. Kerry, who says, ''We need to get some things done in this country: affordable health care, rolling back tax cuts for the wealthy, really investing in our kids. That's why I'm running for president.''
 An announcer adds, ''John Kerry: the military experience to defend America. A new plan to create jobs and put our economy back on track.''
 Mr. Kerry's advisers were trying to achieve several goals with the 30-second spot. For one thing, they sought to raise his military experience as a way to beat back accusations by the Bush administration that he lacks the strength to be commander in chief. The aides also said the commercial was meant to stand in contrast to recent confrontational advertisements by Mr. Bush.
 ''It's about changing the tone in the campaign,'' Mike Donilon, a senior aide to Mr. Kerry, said in a conference call. ''We believe the country wants to hear a positive case, and John Kerry's going to provide it.''
 Mr. Kerry's aides said that they would not stop hitting back when criticized, but that the thrust of their activity moving forward would be to raise issues like job losses and rising health care costs.
 Mr. Bush's strategists said the advertisement did little more than raise Mr. Kerry's war experience. Mimicking a Seinfeld episode, a Bush campaign spokesman, Terry Holt, characterized Mr. Kerry's message as ''I went to Vietnam, yada yada yada. I want to be president.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Is Faulted For Papers' Release

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department's inspector general reported Monday that Treasury officials should not have released 140 of 19,000 documents that former Secretary Paul H. O'Neill requested and was given after his dismissal in December 2002. Mr. O'Neill, however, did nothing wrong, the investigation concluded. 
 Material culled from all the documents, including the 140 that the report found should have been classified, became the backbone of a book, ''The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House and the Education of Paul O'Neill'' (Simon & Schuster).
 The book, written by Ron Suskind in cooperation with Mr. O'Neill and published in January, tracks the latter's two bumpy years as Treasury secretary before his dismissal, part of a shake-up of Mr. Bush's economic team. It is highly critical of the president, describing him as disengaged on some issues but riveted by at least one: ending Saddam Hussein's rule in Iraq. 
 The report by the inspector general, Jeffrey Rush Jr., said that mislabeling had caused the release of the ''national security or sensitive but unclassified'' material but that neither Mr. O'Neill nor anyone in the department had broken any laws.
 ''Had these 140 documents been properly marked as classified,'' the report said, ''the documents would not have been entered into Treasury's unclassified computer system and O'Neill would not have received them.''
 Mr. O'Neill's successor, John W. Snow, told Congress last month that procedures were being changed to prevent similar disclosures.

HEADLINE: John C. West, Crusading South Carolina Governor, Dies at 81

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
John C. West, a former Democratic governor of South Carolina and a pacesetter for the post-segregationist South, died Sunday at his home on Hilton Head Island. Mr. West, a lawyer who was also a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, was 81.
 His death was announced by his law firm in Hilton Head Island. 
 Mr. West was governor from 1971 to 1975. He stood out among Southern politicians for vowing to rid the state government of ''any vestige of discrimination'' and to make it ''colorblind,'' an inaugural-address affirmation echoed by another freshman governor in the South, Jimmy Carter of Georgia.
 Mr. West promptly appointed a young community and labor organizer, James E. Clyburn, as a senior aide, the first black man to serve in the inner circle of a governor. In 1972 Mr. West established the South Carolina Human Affairs Commission under Mr. Clyburn to sort out the bitter aftermath of what was known as the Orangeburg massacre.
 Four years earlier, during a protest at South Carolina State University, a historically black institution, highway patrolmen killed 3 students and wounded 27.
 Mr. Clyburn remained with the commission until 1992, when he was elected the first black United States representative from South Carolina.
 ''We were breaking ground,'' Mr. Clyburn, now a power in the Congressional Black Caucus, told The Charlotte Observer. ''No Southern state was doing what John West was doing. None.''
 Mr. West created a state housing authority to run programs to help low-income individuals and families obtain affordable housing. He was credited with strengthening the state's economic position by attracting industries and investment, but even more with helping to change the tone of Southern politics for good.
 His election in 1970 was by a convincing margin supplied by white and black voters alike. The loser had been handpicked by Senator Strom Thurmond, and the loss was seen as a catalyst for Mr. Thurmond to recast his own public image on racial issues in the state.
 John Carl West was born in Camden, S.C. He graduated from the Citadel in 1942 and attained the rank of Army major in World War II. He received his law degree summa cum laude at the University of South Carolina Law School in 1948.
 He started as a law partner in a Camden firm and was elected to the State Senate from Kershaw County in 1954. From 1966 through 1970 he was lieutenant governor.
 In 1977, President Carter chose him as his ambassador to Saudi Arabia. He later became a distinguished professor of Middle Eastern studies at the University of South Carolina. He also resumed the practice of law and most recently was counsel to Bethea, Jordan & Griffin in Hilton Head Island.
 Mr. West is survived by his wife of 61 years, Lois Rhame West; a daughter, Shelton W. Bosley of Hilton Head Island; two sons, Douglas A., of Hilton Head Island, and John C. Jr., of Camden; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.


CORRECTION-DATE: April 7, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on March 23 about former Gov. John C. West of South Carolina attributed a political distinction erroneously to a former aide, James E. Clyburn. He was not the first black elected to Congress from that state; that was Joseph H. Rainey, who was seated in 1870.

HEADLINE: A Chip in the Global Game of Bank Reshuffling

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: LONDON, March 18 

 BODY:
Ask the investment bankers overlooking Deutsche Bank's trading floor here what blockbuster deal they might do next, and the answer is as uniform as the suspenders and chalk-stripe suits: their own.
 With speculation swirling that Deutsche Bank may be acquired or merge with a foreign bank, each banker has a theory, offered confidentially, about what rival would be a candidate -- Citigroup, HSBC, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan Chase, Barclays, or even the Royal Bank of Scotland.
 Long the pinnacle of Germany's financial establishment -- at once immovable and impregnable -- Deutsche Bank has become a chip in a global game of bank reshuffling. Citigroup has made two passes at Deutsche Bank, holding preliminary talks last summer and in January.
 Though that dalliance has cooled, there is an emerging consensus that Deutsche Bank will pursue what deal watchers like to call a ''transforming transaction.'' 
 ''From Deutsche Bank's point of view, this is a logical step forward,'' said Max Dietzsch-Doertenbach, who runs a private investment firm in Frankfurt. ''One views it with a sad eye because Deutsche Bank was almost a national shrine for the financing of Germany after World War II.''
 For all its prestige in Germany, Deutsche remains a middleweight in the global banking arena. With a stock market value of $47.8 billion, it is worth less than a fifth of Citigroup. Yet, because the bank's Swiss-born chief executive, Josef Ackermann, has sharply cut costs and turned red ink to black, Deutsche Bank has become a plausible takeover candidate. 
 And Mr. Ackermann has done this despite the distractions of a criminal trial on charges that he and other board members of the former telecommunications giant Mannesmann betrayed that company's shareholders. 
 Now, as the banking industry consolidates, several of Deutsche's most influential bankers say they need a partner with a more recognizable name and a broader retail network.
 ''Deutsche Bank currently only touches the man in the street in three countries: Germany, Italy and Spain,'' said Anshu Jain, the head of the bank's profitable bond trading and underwriting division. ''Many of our businesses would be considered arcane by the retail customer.''
 Mr. Jain, a 41-year-old Indian with an M.B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, symbolizes the new breed of Deutsche bankers. They speak mainly English, work in London or New York rather than the dozy headquarters in Frankfurt, and keep score by the value of their stock.
 ''These praetorians of investment banking, who own a lot of Deutsche Bank shares, are a real pressure group,'' Mr. Dietzsch-Doertenbach said. ''Let's face it, decision making is already in London.''
 That does not mean the deal makers will have a free hand. Deutsche Bank has powerful Germans on its board, some of them known to loathe the prospect of selling. A sale would also have enormous political ramifications in Germany, which is still limping out of a recession.
 Publicly, the bank has declined to comment on the Citigroup talks or any other potential deals. Mr. Ackermann said at a news conference last month, ''I do not expect a hostile takeover, and we are not ready for a friendly one.'' He turned down a request for an interview.
 Executives at Deutsche Bank say their boss is playing for time. Since January, Mr. Ackermann has spent two days a week in a courtroom in Dusseldorf, where he and other former board members of Mannesmann are on trial, accused of awarding improper bonuses to its executives amid a takeover battle with Vodafone of Britain.
 The stakes are huge. If convicted, Mr. Ackermann, 55, could face up to 10 years in prison. 
 While legal experts say they think that the more likely outcome is a settlement or an acquittal, the proceedings have cast a shadow over Mr. Ackermann's future, making a deal hard for potential buyers to contemplate.
 ''Ackermann is a very important person for Deutsche Bank, at a time when it is restructuring and trying to find its place among the banks of the world,'' said Theodor Baums, a law professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt who led a commission on corporate governance in Germany. 
 Mr. Ackermann, several executives said, would like to put the trial behind him before he embarks on a serious courtship. The hearings, however, could stretch until the end of June.
 Still, Mr. Ackermann's legal troubles have not paralyzed him. In January, before the trial opened, he and two other Deutsche executives met twice with Citigroup's top executives, Sanford I. Weill and Charles O. Prince, at a corporate retreat in Armonk, N.Y., people involved in the talks said.
 Citigroup laid the groundwork for the talks in an earlier meeting between Mr. Weill and the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. In that session, according to people briefed on the talks, Mr. Weill asked Mr. Schroder if he would have any objections to a takeover of Deutsche Bank.
 Mr. Schroder is said to have signaled he would not oppose it, though German officials insisted that he gave Mr. Weill no explicit go-ahead. Citigroup declined to comment on the meetings.
 Opposition to a deal has come from other pillars of the German establishment. The chief financial officers of several companies, including Deutsche Telekom and SAP, have warned Mr. Schroder against a foreign takeover. They argued that Germany needed a domestic bank with international resources to lend money to its corporations.
 ''The view of Germany from New York is a different one,'' said a German official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''That could influence the loan process. This is not a nationalistic argument; it is a financial one.''
 In the end, the Citigroup negotiations may have been torpedoed by insiders at Deutsche Bank. Several executives based in London say that a German member of the bank's supervisory board leaked details about the talks in an effort to scuttle them. Executives at rival firms say the London bankers leaked the talks to drive up Deutsche's share price.
 Such dissension reflects a longstanding culture clash between Deutsche's German retail bankers and its non-German investment bankers. Not surprisingly, it is rooted in money: the investment bankers are paid more than their retail colleagues, much of it in stock and options.
 For highly compensated players -- like Mr. Jain; Kevin Parker, the head of equities; and Michael Cohrs, the head of investment banking -- a sale to Citigroup would be a huge personal payday.
 ''Our fortunes are linked to the share price,'' said Mr. Jain, whose fixed-income unit generates a third of Deutsche's revenue and more than two-thirds of its pretax profit.
 While Deutsche Bank has begun granting equity to its German executives, the practice is recent, even for Mr. Ackermann. That means the Germans are, in effect, salary men. Their compensation is in the form of perks, including plush offices at the headquarters, even after retirement.
 The London bankers rarely show up, even to visit. ''It really upsets these guys that the newcomers don't want to join them in their big offices,'' said one banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 The irony is that Deutsche Bank's push into investment banking was spearheaded by members of this old guard, including the two previous chief executives, Rolf E. Breuer and Hilmar Kopper.
 Mindful that its German branch-banking network was burdened with heavy costs, Deutsche began expanding in the late 1980's, acquiring the British merchant bank, Morgan Grenfell. Mr. Breuer hired Mr. Ackermann from Credit Suisse in 1996, and gave him a mandate to build a top investment bank. In 1999, Deutsche acquired Bankers Trust for $10 billion.
 Since Mr. Ackermann succeeded Mr. Breuer in 2002, he has cut thousands of jobs and $7.4 billion in costs, bringing down its cost-income ratio to 79 percent, from 85 percent. Analysts, while impressed, said he still had a way to go: Citigroup's cost-income ratio is closer to 50 percent.
 Mr. Ackermann has also begun selling Deutsche Bank's stakes in industrial and financial holdings, among them the insurer Munich Re. These investments, another relic of its role as the financier of German industry, have become costly, tying up capital in dreary companies.
 Propelled by the rich trading business, particularly in debt and equity derivatives, Deutsche Bank's corporate investment bank is the world's third largest in sales, after those of Citigroup and J.P. Morgan. It is also one of the largest asset managers, with $750 billion under management.
 Success has emboldened Mr. Ackermann. He has set a goal of lifting pretax profits to 6.5 billion euros ($8 billion) in 2004, from 3.6 billion euros last year. And he is aiming for a pretax return on equity of 25 percent, up from 13 percent. Deutsche Bank lost money as recently as the first quarter of 2003.
 Analysts are skeptical, because as its business picks up, Deutsche Bank's costs will rise, since it will have to pay richer bonuses. Its record on meeting previous goals is checkered. David Williams, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, noted that the bank fell short of the profit goal it set for 2003 because the market did not rally as much as it expected.
 ''You can either say, 'it's a market problem, don't blame them,''' Mr. Williams said. ''Or you can say they miscalculated.''
 A more structural problem is that 8.5 million of Deutsche's retail customers are in Germany, where its operations are plagued by anemic profits because of their fragmented nature and the role played by government-owned banks and cooperatives. Mr. Williams does not expect that to change any time soon.
 For these reasons, Deutsche Bank's stock has lacked what bankers call ''fantasy value.'' In the last 12 months, spurred by deal rumors, it has risen 63 percent, to a recent 66.90 euros a share ($82.15).
 The list of potential partners, while long, is riddled with caveats. Citigroup has been focusing recently on Asia, announcing a deal to acquire KorAm Bank in South Korea for $2.73 billion. J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America are both digesting mammoth acquisitions.
 Deutsche's bankers are less enthusiastic about a merger with a British retail bank, like HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Barclays or the Royal Bank of Scotland, since it would do little to help its investment bank.
 The prospect of a merger with Credit Suisse is enticing to those who dwell on political sensitivities. Mr. Ackermann, they note, spent most of his career there, and Credit Suisse is nearly the same size as Deutsche Bank, removing the humbling prospect of a takeover.
 The question is whether Credit Suisse's customers -- many of them Germans who chose a Swiss bank for tax reasons -- would tolerate seeing their money end up in a German institution.
 Much, of course, will depend on Mr. Ackermann's trial. At issue is whether he and other directors violated the trust of Mannesmann's shareholders by awarding 57 million euros ($70 million) in severance and bonuses to the former chief executive, Klaus Esser, and other senior managers, shortly after they acquiesced to a $183 billion takeover bid by Vodafone in 2000.
 Sir Christopher Gent, the former chairman of Vodafone who engineered the deal, has been called to testify on Wednesday. The panel of judges will then decide whether to continue the hearings.
 For Mr. Ackermann, who works part time in Frankfurt while his family lives in Switzerland, it has been a difficult experience. He has become a national symbol of American-style corporate excess.
 ''Ackermann could have avoided a lot of trouble, if he had laid down some guidelines and made it transparent to the public,'' Professor Baums, the governance specialist, said.
 With Deutsche Bank a possible takeover target, its shareholders may soon be hoping for a little clarity themselves.

To the Editor:
 Unlike President Bush, Elizabeth Bennet is able to admit to herself that prejudice blinded her to reality (''Pride and Prejudice,'' by Maureen Dowd, column, March 18). It's a painful admission. She feels ashamed, as most of us do when we make a huge error in judgment. But only when we're honest enough to admit our mistakes can we move on.

HEADLINE: New Theater For Brooklyn Arts District

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
A $22 million, 299-seat theater designed by the architects Frank Gehry and Hugh Hardy is expected to be the newest ornament of a growing cultural district in Brooklyn. 
 The multipurpose experimental space, to be built on a city-owned parking lot adjacent to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, would serve as the first permanent home for the Theater for a New Audience, a 25-year-old Off Broadway company known for its productions of Shakespeare and classical drama as well as its educational programs in New York City schools. 
 The city's Economic Development Corporation has committed $6.2 million to the building's construction. The 40-member board of the Theater for a New Audience, which includes Zoe Caldwell, Robert Caro, Dana Ivey and Julie Taymor, has mounted a campaign to raise the balance of the money for the building, which the theater will own and operate. 
 Harvey Lichtenstein, chairman of the BAM Local Development Corporation, said he expected that the new building would give the cultural district even greater momentum. ''It is a significant milestone on the way to our goal of establishing an arts district that will serve the neighborhood, Brooklyn and the whole city,'' he said.
 The nonprofit development corporation is in its fourth year of overseeing a 10-year, $630 million master plan to create an arts district in the environs of downtown Brooklyn, Park Slope, Fort Greene, Boerum Hill and Clinton Hill. 
 The theater is to be built next to the planned Brooklyn Public Library for the Visual and Performing Arts designed by Enrique Norten of TEN Arquitectos in Mexico City. Both buildings are scheduled to be completed in 2008. 
 The new theater would join a nucleus of other arts buildings clustered around the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The cultural district would offer mixed-income housing, studios and performance and rehearsal spaces as part of a master plan created by architects including Rem Koolhaas, Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio. 
 Other facilities already in place are the academy, the Mark Morris Dance Studio, the BAM Harvey Theater and a recycled office building, owned by the Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York, that provides rehearsal and administrative space for 21 small theater companies. 
 The BAM development corporation's $6 million renovation of the James E. Davis Arts Building, at 80 Hanson Place, is scheduled for completion this summer. It is to house 15 to 20 cultural organizations. 
 The triangular parking lot site for the library and the proposed theater is just across Ashland Place from the academy's main building and the nearly adjacent Williamsburgh Savings Bank building, the area's most prominent landmark. The other sides of the theater would border Flatbush and Lafayette Avenues. The current 125-car parking space is to be replaced by a 400-vehicle underground garage. 
 ''Having its own home will be transformative for our theater,'' said Jeffrey Horowitz, artistic director and founder of the Theater for a New Audience. ''It would give us a permanent place in a community and give us more money to spend on our productions, instead of renting space.'' 
 The 25,000-square-foot new theater building is to include a main stage, a 50-seat rehearsal and performance space, and room for administrative offices. There would also be a cafe facing a tree-bordered public area -- also available for exhibitions and performances -- in front of the new library. Mr. Horowitz said the design was based on historic Elizabethan courtyard theaters and was inspired by the Cottesloe Theater of the Royal National Theater in London. 
 Like the Cottesloe, the new building would permit many different audience configurations, including the classic proscenium stage as well as a thrust stage and a theater in the round. It is to have a high ceiling and a trapped floor, allowing actors access to the stage from underneath it, ''which is essential for Shakespearean characters, many of whom, like Caliban, enter from below,'' Mr. Horowitz said. 
 The theater company was founded by Mr. Horowitz in 1979 to encourage the performance and study of classic drama. It has introduced more than 100,000 public school students to Shakespeare. 
 Although its productions have not always been accorded critical raves, the company has been nominated many times for Tony, Drama Desk and Drama League awards, and has won several Lucille Lortel and Obie awards. 
 The proposed new theater would ''be a friendly neighbor and will provide educational programs for the community,'' said Susan Goldfinger, senior vice president of the real-estate development department of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which has committed $6.2 million from the Mayor's capital budget for the theater's construction. The city-owned land is to be conveyed to the theater through a long-term ground lease. 
 Some community groups have angrily opposed the proposed arrival of a $485 million New Jersey Nets arena, the centerpiece of a $2.5 billion residential and commercial complex that the developer Bruce C. Ratner envisions for the area straddling the Atlantic Avenue rail yards not far from the academy. Mr. Gehry is also the prospective architect of the Nets project.
 Some local residents fear that an influx of arts groups would further drive up rents in the neighborhood, pushing out working-class minority residents.
 Mr. Lichtenstein, the Brooklyn Academy's leader from 1967 to 1999, said the area had been gentrifying long before the advent of the cultural district. ''We're encouraging the construction of middle-income housing there,'' he said, adding that no existing structures would be displaced to make way for the new theater, except for those in parking lot.
 ''I think the neighborhood would welcome it, because it's not about lining some developer's pocket,'' Patti Hagan said of the new theater. She is spokeswoman for the Prospect Heights Action Coalition, which has opposed Mr. Ratner's plan. Mr. Ratner is also the development partner of The New York Times Company in a new building for the newspaper's headquarters. 
 Mr. Horowitz, who lives in Boerum Hill, said the theater could be rented to cultural organizations and local groups 12 to 16 weeks a year, when company productions were not running. ''Our educational programs will reach out to the neighborhood,'' he said. 
 The theater company, which has a $3 million annual operating budget, has been looking for a permanent home since 1997. 
 ''The theater is tiny, and the budget is tiny,'' Mr. Gehry said, ''but we hope this can lead to an interesting space.'' He has designed theaters in Los Angeles and Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., and is creating another in Miami. 
 As currently envisioned the theater is to have an open, glassy lobby space that would be ''its own marquee, statement and front door,'' said Mr. Hardy, an architect on many previous theater projects, including the renovations of the New Victory, the New Amsterdam, the Joyce and Radio City Music Hall.

HEADLINE: Trying to Squeeze More Oil and Gas From the Gulf of Mexico

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: ABOARD THE MARCO POLO PLATFORM, in the Gulf of Mexico 

 BODY:
With energy prices climbing to their highest level in more than a decade, amid OPEC threats to cut oil production and concern about soaring demand for natural gas, federal officials and energy companies are making the Gulf of Mexico the focus of a renewed push to increase domestic production.
 It is not at all clear whether these new forays will pay off, even though the Minerals Management Service, the federal agency that manages offshore mineral resources, recently increased its estimates of reserves of ''deep shelf'' natural gas by 175 percent.
 Oil production in the gulf has almost doubled in the last decade, and could reach 1.87 million barrels a day this year, according to federal estimates, even as onshore output in the United States has been declining for years. With energy prices rising, investors are piling back in: the latest round of bidding for federal offshore leases, held last week in New Orleans, attracted the largest number of bids in six years, the minerals agency said.
 Skeptics in the oil patch, however, still call the Gulf of Mexico the ''Dead Sea'' because many earlier production forecasts proved illusory. They criticize investments in the gulf even as many of them praise investments in leases and wells in other, more exotic offshore tracts from western Africa to Kazakhstan to Brazil. 
 When Anadarko Petroleum installed this 12,500-ton floating platform in the waters 160 miles south of New Orleans in January, for example, it was considered a feat of engineering. But the financial markets were not impressed. Shares in Anadarko, based in Houston, fell more than 4 percent in the days after the installation as investors complained that the company was badly behind schedule. And Anadarko itself soon cut its own production forecasts, citing stormy weather.
 ''This is certainly not a positive development for a company aiming to restore investor confidence,'' John A. Bailey, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a report. Another analyst, John Gerdes of Southwest Securities, downgraded Anadarko.
 Even as the Gulf of Mexico's role in domestic oil supplies has grown more prominent -- it accounted for 30 percent of domestic production last year, from 16 percent in 1995, and is expected to grow to 40 percent by 2010 -- the area is a small part of the global market. It accounted for just 2 percent of total world production in 2003, and while production in the gulf is growing and is expected to peak at 2.4 million barrels a day around 2009 or 2010, it is expected to decline to about 2 million a day by 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration.
 Gas production, which was once thought to have peaked in the early 1990's, is also expected to increase from current levels. Projections of a decline in the gulf explain in part the mammoth investments oil companies are making in other countries with large offshore reserves. In Kazakhstan, for example, a group including ENI of Italy, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell confirmed recently that it was proceeding with a $29 billion project to develop that nation's Kashagan field.
 Still, largely because the Gulf of Mexico is so close to major refineries and pipelines in Texas and Louisiana, Robert W. Esser, a senior consultant and director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said he considered the region ''the world's premier exploration province.''
 That may explain why exploration companies submitted 827 bids worth a total of $368.8 million for 557 tracts at the mineral service's auction in New Orleans last week. The most sought-after tracts were in shallow waters that could contain gas deposits deep under the continental shelf and in very deep waters where technology is allowing drillers to search for gas with greater efficiency.
 The main risk of drilling in deep-shelf waters, where wells descend 15,000 feet or more beneath the sea floor, is the possibility that companies might find no gas at all after investing millions of dollars. Nexen, a Canadian energy company, jolted the industry in February when it reported that a well it had drilled with a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell had come up dry. The unproductive well, at nearly 26,000 feet the deepest ever drilled on the gulf shelf, cost the companies about $35 million.
 ''Folks think the Gulf of Mexico is just around the corner again when something like this dry hole pops up,'' said William Walker, president of Howard Weil Labouisse Friedrichs, a New Orleans investment bank. ''Is the gas there, and is it there in quantities that justify large investments? Yes, but the technology needs to get better to reduce the costs and risks.''
 Anadarko's new platform illustrates the lengths -- literally and figuratively -- that energy companies will have to go to if they want to tap the region's reserves. This platform, in 4,300 feet of water, is connected to the sea floor by flexible metal tendons, and it sways so much that visitors arriving by helicopter are given motion-sickness tablets before they land. Still, the platform can produce 50,000 barrels of oil a day.
 Federal officials also say that incentives are needed to encourage greater investment in the gulf. The Minerals Management Service, a part of the Interior Department, took one such step in January, when it said it would suspend royalty collections on successful wells drilled in some parts of the gulf. It cited the domestic demand for natural gas, which is forecast to grow 42 percent over the next two decades.
 ''The gap between supply and demand for natural gas is a national problem that is not going away,'' Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton said in an interview. ''Our incentives should help offset the tremendously high costs of exploration and production in frontier areas of the gulf.''
 While energy executives and analysts said that fewer royalty payments would generate more revenue from some projects, it remains to be seen whether the new policy will result in more exploration. At best, over the life of a project, the minerals agency's program would cut royalties on some producing wells by more than 10 percent, but such a reduction would matter little to companies weighing the risk of spending $20 million to $30 million to drill a well.
 ''The royalty relief is much ado about nothing,'' Mr. Esser of Cambridge Energy said.
 The biggest test of whether the gulf can fulfill expectations of meeting a growing portion of the nation's demand for oil and gas is expected over the next three years, when bidding is set to begin on expiring leases for many deepwater tracts. Still, many companies are waiting to see how relatively new projects like Anadarko's platform proceed before they consider bidding.
 In an unusual arrangement, Anadarko operates the platform while it is owned by two other Houston energy companies with experience in the gulf -- GulfTerra and Cal Dive International. Executives at Anadarko said this arrangement freed them to focus on producing from the field directly below Marco Polo and in nearby areas that can be served by the platform, which was designed to process as much as 120,000 barrels of oil and 300 million cubic feet of natural gas a day eventually.
 ''This project needs to pay not only for itself but for other explorations as well,'' said Richard C. Pratt, Anadarko's manager of Gulf of Mexico operations, as he gained his footing shortly after arriving on Marco Polo, swallowing Dramamine tablets. Mr. Pratt, who used to manage Anadarko's operations in Algeria, said the platform's first barrels of oil should be pumped by the middle of this year -- several months behind schedule.
 ''The attractions of the gulf are its lack of political risk compared with other parts of the world and its proximity to the U.S. market,'' Mr. Pratt said. ''But the fundamental risks here, like the weather or the chance your investment will come up dry, are the same as anywhere else.''

HEADLINE: Nigeria Says Reserves Are Unaffected by Shell Cuts

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23 

 BODY:
Nigeria's national oil company says its oil and gas reserves have not been affected by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group's recent reduction of its estimates of proven reserves in the country.
 In January, Shell stunned investors by reducing its global reserve estimates by 3.9 billion barrels, or 20 percent, including a large but unspecified cut in Nigeria. On Friday, after an article in The New York Times reported on internal company documents that recommended confidential treatment for Nigeria, the company disclosed Nigeria's share was 1.3 billion barrels. 
 That same day, Shell's outside lawyers were contacted by ''a representative of the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan,'' a Shell spokesman, Simon Buerk, said on Tuesday, confirming a report last week in The Times that the Justice Department had started an inquiry into the company's disclosures.
 A statement provided on Monday by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, responding to questions submitted a week ago, said Shell's revision did not affect Nigeria's position because of different standards of reporting reserves. Nigerian national standards, according to the statement, allow reserves to be reported even if they have only a 10 percent chance of being recovered. The more rigorous regulatory standard, under which Shell and other publicly traded companies operate, only allows those with a 90 percent chance of recovery with existing wells and equipment to be reported as proven reserves.
 Another difference is that proven reserves, under the Securities and Exchange Commission definition, involve a financial commitment to extract the resource, while Nigeria's standards are focused on the geological resources.
 ''There is no precise international legal standard or industry agreement on how to classify reserves,'' said Fatih Birol, the chief economist at the International Energy Agency, ''and this is a major concern for consumers and producers.''
 There have been international efforts to increase transparency between resource rich countries and private companies. A report to be released on Wednesday by Global Witness, a London based nongovernmental group, highlights some of the problems in oil revenue reporting.
 The issue is important because much of the world's oil is in less-developed countries like Nigeria, but most of the financial and technological resources needed to develop that oil are in the hands of large Western companies like Shell.
 The Nigerian oil company said that its relations with oil companies were cordial and that ''the strength each party brings to the partnership and the dividends outweigh the differences.''
 Shell informed Nigeria ''of the significant revisions'' in its S.E.C. proven reserves in early January 2004, the statement also said.
 A report prepared for Shell's senior managers last December had recommended keeping secret from investors the details of its revisions in Nigeria for fear of damaging its business relationship as well as Nigeria's dealings with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. One reason cited in the report was the likelihood that it would ''undermine the current resolution'' of bonus negotiations between the two parties, even though the bonus pertained to the Nigerian definition of reserves, not the stricter S.E.C. definition.
 But the Nigerian statement said that ''there is no linkage between Shell's lowering of its proved reserve estimate for Nigeria and the resolution of the bonus issue.''

PERSON: REGINE LATORTUE

HEADLINE: As Cousin Leads Haiti, Her Calling Is in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
REGINE LATORTUE'S spacious Victorian-style home in Flatbush, Brooklyn, is decorated with most things Haitian, like contemporary paintings of Haitian women, sculptures and books. Then there are the turtles, large and small, in jade, crystal, silver, wood, obsidian and shell. Dozens of them occupy her five-bedroom house. Ms. Latortue is very proud of her last name, French for ''the turtle.''
 Yet even as Ms. Latortue gazes admiringly at her turtles, she says the collection does not come close to that of Gerard Latortue, her cousin and Haiti's new prime minister. ''He has an impressive collection,'' she says, placing a coffee tray on a living room table before lighting a cigarette to ruminate on Haiti's woes. 
 Ms. Latortue, 51, is a professor of comparative black literature and Haitian studies at Brooklyn College. And there seems no need to add that her cousin has little time now to collect turtles. He was appointed to lead an interim government earlier this month after a violent upheaval that forced the departure of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
 The selection of Mr. Latortue by a United States-backed council of eminent Haitians comes as no surprise to Ms. Latortue. She says he is devoted to Haiti, and has the skills to help rebuild the country. He worked for decades as a top official in the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.
 ''His attitude is, 'I'm here and my focus is to serve the people of Haiti, not the other way around,''' she says, describing her cousin's sense of duty. ''This is a temporary position, and an opportunity to do what all of us want to do, to leave a better world behind. Most Haitians, if called upon to help, would answer the call. I think sometimes that's been a problem: too many Haitians, particularly men, are convinced things would be better if they were in power.''
 Ms. Latortue sighs heavily, contemplating the job her cousin faces. She pauses with a coffee cup in one hand, a smoldering cigarette in the other.
 ''I wasn't supportive of Aristide, but I hoped and prayed it would get better, because being president or prime minister of Haiti is not a job I would wish on my worst enemy,'' she says, sending her regards to her cousin, who left behind the life of a semiretiree in suburban Boca Raton, Fla. ''He has my full sympathy.''
 Ms. Latortue has an amiable manner and wide-set eyes that often glimmer with humor. But in a long conversation, her husky French-accented voice grows weary and sad at times as she talks about the turmoil in Haiti. ''Yes, it is a mess, but so be it,'' she says. ''We are in it. That's the fact, and quite definitely, only we can get ourselves out of it.'' She feels a deep patriotism about her birthplace, something she says is reflected in the literature of the country. Her family fled Haiti when she was 12 during the dictatorship of Francois Duvalier, known as Papa Doc. She remains ever hopeful about the situation there.
 ''I've learned with Haiti, even when you think this can't get worse, they get worse. But by the same token, things can always get better,'' she says.
 She has not personally congratulated her cousin since his appointment. She says problems with the telephone system in Haiti have prevented her from getting through. But she is not worried. She explains that her mother, who spends half the year in Haiti with her father, helped the new prime minister when he arrived, even answering his telephone at his hotel.
 Ms. Latortue says she last saw her cousin two years ago, but spoke with him on the telephone in January. He is her father's first cousin. She describes Prime Minister Latortue as warm, the sort of man who makes people feel comfortable. ''I have never met anyone at all who doesn't like him,'' she says. ''He is just a positive person.''
 MS. LATORTUE, who is divorced with no children, does not see herself as a community leader, at least in any active sense, in Brooklyn's large Haitian population. ''I'm not like a Sharpton, out there on the streets,'' she says. ''My work is done by example, by my profession and the way I help students.''
 She has taught for 26 years at Brooklyn College since receiving her doctorate from Yale. She was chairwoman of the college's Africana studies department for 15 years, until last year. Next month, she will become the president of the College Language Association, a national academic group founded by black scholars that focuses on English, literature and foreign languages. She is also the coordinator of a bilingual education technical center at Brooklyn College, which helps public school teachers with students whose first language is Creole.
 Literature has been Ms. Latortue's passion since childhood, and she excelled in school. She says she was allowed to skip four grades and to enroll at 14 years old as an undergraduate at Trinity College in Washington. Her father, a lawyer, worked for the Organization of American States in Washington, and her mother was an administrator in the fellowship program of the World Health Organization.
 Ms. Latortue does not feel conflicted about not heeding Haiti's siren call the way her cousin has.
 She likes her life simple and quiet, even if it is that of an overworked professor revolving around the college and home, with maybe a quick trip to the grocery store.
 ''I have too many things to do than to sit around discussing Haitian politics.''

HEADLINE: Architects Protect a Controversial Modern Building

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., March 23 

 BODY:
For 40 years, the city's only office building designed by a modern architect of international stature has sparked contrasting opinions in this downtown of classical style corporate headquarters. 
 The 22-story monolith of rough concrete designed by I.M. Pei was hailed as a building sure to bring about a design renaissance when plans were unveiled in 1964. To local architects, the brutalist structure is a work of sculpture. 
 But from the moment it opened in 1971, the building at 12th and Market Streets, just off Rodney Square in the heart of the central business district, has had trouble finding and retaining tenants. Complaints have run from the small floor size of about 6,000 square feet to leaky roofs and windows to difficulties with temperature control. The building has had consistently high vacancy rates for 10 to 15 years. 
 So it came as some surprise earlier this year when the city's normally reserved community of architects rose up in protest over proposed renovations to the structure by the building's new owners, Keystone Property Group of Conshohocken, Pa. The privately held real estate company has carved out a niche in buying and refurbishing tired or vacant properties in the Philadelphia area, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
 After meeting with the protesting architects, Keystone revised its plans, saying the drawings were early concept designs. But the contretemps illustrates the difficulties so-called value-added buyers of underperforming properties sometimes encounter in communities that have an intense interest in their buildings, real estate brokers said.
 ''I think it's an issue for any buyer buying an architecturally significant building,'' said Daniel R. Reeder, senior vice president of CB Richard Ellis in Greenville, northwest of Wilmington. 
 Keystone bought the building in October for $6.28 million, or $36 a square foot. By contrast, the building next door, known as the Chase Manhattan Center, sold in 2002 for $185 a square foot, according to Robert J. Fahey, executive vice president of CB Richard Ellis in Philadelphia.
 To bring the Pei building up to top-tier space, Keystone said it planned to spend $6 million on improvements. Initial plans called for coating the exterior of the building with a product that would change the raw concrete color to a toothpaste-white. Other proposed changes included a green-granite base to the first story and vertical decorative brackets at each floor along an inside corner of the exterior. 
 The city's architects were appalled, describing it as akin to a makeover of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, a masterpiece of residential design near Pittsburgh. 
 ''We didn't want to lose the historical, architectural context of the building and the period from which it came because that period is gone,'' said Todd T. Breck, president of the Delaware chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
 Changes now will be more on the interior. Exterior changes, which include an aluminum canopy over the entrance, new windows and frames, and a granite base in a light, complementary color, will be sensitive to Mr. Pei's initial design, said the architect on the project, Thomas E. Hall, principal with Thomas E. Hall & Associates in Wayne, Pa. 
 The exterior concrete is to be cleaned and stained a lighter color, but not a stark white. Work has begun on the staining and making outside repairs where concrete has been flaking off.
 Mr. Pei, who said from his New York office that he had not seen the building in at least 25 years, said he thought it was ''wrong'' to put granite cladding on the ground floor, no matter what the color.
 ''The best way is to clean it and put a silicone coating on it,'' he said.
 Local architects said they understood that the building needed some attention to make it more marketable. Office buildings, unlike paintings or sculpture, are supposed to earn their keep, said Eldon du Pont Homsey, president of Homsey Architects Inc.
 Mr. Homsey, who describes himself as a great admirer of the Pei building, said that although it would not be his choice to put granite cladding on the first floor he understood the owner's desire to make the building more pedestrian friendly.
 ''It's understandable given the need to compete with other office buildings,'' Mr. Homsey said.
 Mr. Hall, the project's architect, said he thought the new design achieved a balance between beauty and marketability.
 ''A building that is empty is not successful,'' he said. ''If you can keep the architectural character of the building and lease it, then it's successful. I believe we can do both.'' 
 Perhaps because of Wilmington's small size, downtown buildings garner a lot of interest.
 Some are viewed as public structures although, technically, they are private. One example is the Hotel du Pont in the DuPont Company's headquarters building where people have gathered since 1913.
 MBNA, the credit card bank whose headquarters are near the Pei building on Rodney Square, avoided controversy last year when it began renovating a 1916 public building for its new headquarters by making very few changes to the exterior. Plans to fit out the building for executive offices have since been scrapped as the bank moves into a more cost-conscious phase. The building, which is connected to MBNA's headquarters building by a pedestrian bridge, will be used for other bank functions that have yet to be determined.
 Many Wilmington residents still recall the construction of the Pei building and how the project took six years to finish.
 ''We're invested in that building because it took so long to complete,'' said Richard V. Pryor, the city's director of economic development who acted as an informal mediator between the architects and Keystone.
 Constructed by the American Life Insurance Company primarily as an investment, it was built on a 120-by-200-foot lot that had formerly been the site of a small hotel. 
 Mr. Pei designed the building, then known as the Wilmington Tower, to cover only 70 percent of the site so it would not overwhelm its smaller-scale neighbors, including a former Civil War-era mansion now used as a clubhouse by the Wilmington Club, a social club.
 Real estate brokers remember that the building, with 174,000 square feet of rentable space, failed to fill up after it opened. Nearly a year after completion American Life occupied an annex to the building, while the tower had just two tenants, both law firms. Rental rates were dropped by 25 percent and the building was quietly put up for sale.
 Keystone's plan is to reposition the building from several standpoints, including internal systems, energy efficiency, external appearance and leasing strategy, said Gregory R. Hansen, senior vice president with Keystone.
 Visitors to the building are likely to see the most dramatic changes in the lobby, which currently has a cavelike feel with towering raw concrete walls and little natural light.
 To create a more inviting entrance, space that had been used for offices will be incorporated into a new 6,000-square-foot lobby. In addition, a first-floor glass wall will be added on the northern side facing 12th Street.
 The lobby space will include a mezzanine with decorative staircase. Plans are to lease that space to a restaurant or shops.
 Because there is nothing that can be done to expand the small floor sizes, Keystone said it intended to market space to tenants such as law firms or financial companies looking for one or two floors. There are plans to build another adjoining tower next to the building.
 The current asking rate of $22 a square foot annually will be raised to $24.50 a square foot when renovations are completed by fall, Mr. Hansen said.
 The effective rent for top-of-the line space in the city ranges from $22 to $26 a square foot, Mr. Reeder, the broker, said.
 ''I think it will lease -- the views are spectacular -- but it will take a little bit more time,'' he said ''because of its small floor plates and the type of tenants that will be attracted to this type of building.''

HEADLINE: Plan for Jets' West Side Stadium Surges Ahead

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
New York City and state officials say they will unveil plans tomorrow to build the Jets a 75,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof on the far West Side of Manhattan and to nearly double the size of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center next door.
 It would be one of the city's most ambitious urban redevelopment projects, officials said yesterday, second only to the $12 billion rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. 
 It would also open a new chapter for professional football in Manhattan. The last major game was on Dec. 14, 1963, when the Jets -- the former New York Titans -- lost, 19-10, to Buffalo before 6,526 fans at the Polo Grounds in Harlem. That stadium was torn down four months later. The Jets moved to Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens, where they played until they left New York altogether in 1984 for the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey. 
 Elements of the West Side plans have been circulating for years. But the announcement tomorrow at the Javits center will mark the first formal commitment by the city and state to move forward, with hopes of breaking ground next year. The $2.8 billion proposal is tied to plans to lure the 2012 Summer Olympics and extend subway service west.
 When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki unveil the plans and a proposed financing package, the project will be called the New York Sports and Convention Center. The new stadium, to be built over rail yards, is viewed as a significant element in creating a half-mile ''convention corridor'' that will stretch along 11th Avenue from 30th to 40th Streets.
 Despite the push by the governor and the mayor, the projects still face a series of hurdles, including an environmental review, zoning approvals, state legislation for the Javits expansion and any legal actions.
 The project would be financed with $600 million each from the city and state, $500 million from a temporary hotel tax, $800 million from the Jets and the remainder from other private sources.
 The $1.4 billion stadium has been the project's most debated element. While the $1.4 billion Javits expansion has wide support, some Broadway theater owners, community groups and elected officials fear the stadium will displace working-class residents and increase traffic congestion and pollution. Most everyone predicts there will be lawsuits.
 To blunt criticism by economists that stadiums are poor public investments, the city has worked with the Jets to design the stadium so that it can be used for conventions, trade shows, meetings and plenary sessions, as well as concerts and other sporting events.
 The stadium would also double as the Olympic stadium if the city wins its bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The city is eager to move the projects forward now, in part, because it wants to show some progress before the International Olympic Committee meets in May to pare its list of candidates for the 2012 Games. The committee will make its final decision in July 2005. The Jets want to start construction next year so they can move into their new home when their current lease expires in 2008.
 Opinions vary on the city's Olympic chances, but real estate and business leaders favor the redevelopment of the far West Side. The city is in the process of rezoning the neighborhood to encourage the development of 30 million square feet of office space over the next 30 years. It also wants to extend the No. 7 subway line west from Times Square underneath 41st Street to 11th Avenue and then south to 34th Street.
 The announcement tomorrow will come a month after Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff proposed a $3.7 billion financing plan to cover the extension of the subway line, create new parks and build a massive deck over a different section of the rail yards, where office buildings and a cultural institution could be built.
 ''The business community considers the expansion of the Javits to be the most significant economic development investment that the city and the state could make,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City. ''And the redevelopment of the far West Side is critical to the future of the city.''
 Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, also supports the Javits expansion, but said ''the jury is still out'' on the stadium.
 ''We have to look at it very carefully,'' he said.
 And Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County, called for more public discussion about the use of scarce public resources for stadiums and the subway extension. ''This has been a back-room operation so far,'' he said. ''There's growing sentiment that it needs a public airing, pro and con.''
 According to state and city officials, the governor will announce the $1.4 billion plan to expand the Javits center north from 38th to 40th Streets. With more exhibition space and meeting rooms, it will be able to attract larger conventions and present more than one trade show at a time, officials say.
 The cost of the Javits project will be covered by $300 million from the city; the $1.50-a-night hotel tax, which would expire once the $500 million goal is met; and the refinancing of the bonds on the Javits. State officials also hope to guarantee the bonds by using the state's Sonny Mae mortgage insurance. 
 They are also hoping that a private company will chip in $200 million for a proposed convention hotel on 42nd Street, although in other cities the hotels have required substantial subsidies.
 The Jets have agreed to put up $800 million for the stadium over the rail yards bound by 11th and 12th Avenues, between 30th and 34th Streets. 
 The $600 million from the state and city would pay for the retractable roof and the platform on which the stadium would be built.
 The Jets would also pay an undetermined rent to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the rail yards, according to executives on both sides. The transit agency is also close to an agreement with the city over compensation for the use of the yards, state and city officials said.

HEADLINE: Taking Broadband Internet Access to the Last 'Last Mile': to Rural America

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
When tech people talk about providing residential users with new phone and Internet services, they talk about the challenges of wiring that ''last mile'' separating your home from the main network. But beyond those last miles now being wired in cities and suburbs, there are still miles and miles of rural America to go. I know. I live there.
 The geography of Internet service in the land of the last ''last miles'' could not be stranger or more discontinuous. I have a friend who lives in the back of beyond in Wyoming -- 20 miles outside a town of 400 people that is, itself, the definition of nowhere. But at the end of his road there's a phone hub -- a fiber-optic intersection -- that gives him broadband access, and the feeling of living on the very first mile. He might as well be in downtown Denver. 
 I live three hours north of New York City and 30 miles from Albany. I am surrounded by small towns with high-speed service. A couple of years ago, a crew ran fiber-optic cable tantalizingly close -- right up the highway that runs past my door. Another crew ran fiber-optic cable down the Thruway, which is only that one last mile away. It seems I live a few thousand feet too far from everything.
 I'm the one living in the real back of beyond: the land of dial-up Internet access.
 Most weeks, I spend a couple of days working half a block from Times Square. In my office I have what nearly every office worker has these days: a fast broadband connection to the Internet, always on, always humming. I remember vividly the first time I used a connection that fast. It was like hearing the news being read aloud by a good tobacco auctioneer. 
 Most of us soon catch up to broadband speed, and we lose the twitchy sensation of that first primal hookup. The auctioneer seems to have slowed down, but we're just listening faster. Every week when I go into work, I still re-experience the historic luxury of the synaptic flash of that broadband link. When I head home to the country, the pace of online life slows down.
 Satellite works fine for television here, but so far it's a balky link for Internet access. I watch the Rural Broadband Coalition Web site for news of developments that may someday connect us to the high-speed grid. In Washington State, there are plans to bring wireless connections to rural customers. Elsewhere, high-speed connections are being offered through electric wall sockets.
 Some days, when our link to the outer world seems unusually crippled, I think of the long-range wireless experiments going on in Sydney, Australia, or Boeing's plan to expand its satellite broadband service to all the ships at sea. I begin to wish that someone would experiment on me.
 But this is more than a matter of inconvenience. These days, when the Internet teems with complex Web sites and oversized files for downloading, broadband is no longer a luxury: it's a necessity. The need to get high-speed access to rural areas is analogous to the rural electrification project that began to transform America in the late 1930's. One of the most critical issues facing this country is the increasing economic and cultural isolation of rural communities -- the abandonment and the ultimate re-democratization of the landscape. No business would settle in a town that lacked electricity, and we are now at the point where no business will settle in a town that lacks broadband access.
 Last year, the United States Department of Agriculture created a $1.4 billion loan program to help underwrite rural broadband expansion. So far only about $30 million has been awarded, perhaps because, as some critics claim, the program is too restrictive.
 It's unlikely that established telecommunications giants will be the ones to bring broadband to the open country. It is going to take the initiative and inventiveness of local communities, partnering with government and small tech companies, to get the job done.
 My hope is that the wait will be worth it, as it often is with technology. Latecomers have a way of leapfrogging over early adopters. Rural America could end up with higher connection speeds than most urban and suburban residential customers now enjoy. 
 Broadband access is no panacea for isolation, not in rural counties where the bus routes have been abandoned and the hospitals have fled, and the towns have shrunk below a sustainable core of residents. But broadband offers a vital two-way pipeline to the outer world. It can provide a beginning for the technological foundation needed to resettle rural America, which desperately needs resettling. Talk to those farmers who were there when the lights first went on in the house and the barn back in the 1930's, and you'll have some idea of just what rural broadband might mean.

HEADLINE: U.S. Law Puts World Ports on Notice

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: PUERTO CORTES, Honduras 

 BODY:
''Right there,'' said Manuel Pereira, a security guard here at the largest shipping port in the Caribbean, pointing to the ground beneath his feet. ''That's the new border of the United States.''
 Since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, American officials have spoken of ''pushing back the borders'' of the United States in the name of national security. Now they are doing it across the seas.
 The threat they envision is a catastrophic attack on a major American port by a ship bearing a bomb. Al Qaeda has sought for seven years to use commercial ships to attack the United States at home and abroad, public records show. 
 A seaborne terrorist attack could cost thousands of lives and inflict billions of dollars in damage, maritime security experts say, while closing major American ports at a cost to world trade measured in tens or hundreds of billions of dollars.
 ''Their ultimate goal is attacking our economy,'' said Adm. James M. Loy, deputy secretary of homeland security and retired commandant of the Coast Guard. ''Our link to the global economy is by water -- 95 percent of what comes and goes to this country comes and goes by ships.''
 The response to this threat is a new law of the sea, spurred by Admiral Loy, passed by Congress and signed by President Bush 16 months ago. A parallel global code was adopted days later under American pressure by the United Nations's International Maritime Organization.
 The law and the code set a July 1 deadline for all of the world's ships and ports to create counterterrorism systems -- computers, communications gear, surveillance cameras, security patrols -- to help secure America against an attack.
 The cost of compliance at home and abroad will be many billions of dollars. Many American and foreign ports lack the funds to comply. But the cost of not complying could be steeper still. The law's demands create a stark confrontation between world trade and national security.
 If a ship, or any one of the last 10 ports it visited, does not meet the new security standards, it can be turned away from American waters. If a port falls short, no ship leaving it can enter American harbors. That means ports, and their nations, can be barred from trading with the United States.
 ''We're dead serious about this,'' said Rear Adm. Larry L. Hereth, director of port security for the Coast Guard. The law holds ''some very harsh economic consequences,'' he said, like banning ships and blacklisting ports, ''and we're prepared to do that.'' Enforcement will largely fall to the United States.
 The high costs and the tight deadline have created a scramble in the world's major ports -- especially in poor ones like Puerto Cortes, a sprawling, run-down harbor crucial to the livelihood of Honduras and its neighbors in Central America.
 Some say the price is too high, the task too huge and the time too short to comply.
 ''The developing world is saying that the wealthiest, most powerful nation in the world is exporting the cost of protecting itself onto some of the world's poorest countries,'' said Stephen E. Flynn, a retired Coast Guard commander and a maritime security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 American officials contend that the costs are outweighed by the benefits: higher security against terrorism will also cut cargo thefts and the smuggling of drugs, guns and people. But if the United States cannot balance the competing demands of national security and global trade, ''we are playing with fire,'' Mr. Flynn said. ''If the U.S. locks down its ports for more than two weeks, the entire global trade system crashes.''
 Policing the sea is daunting: the maritime system is bigger, more complex and far less controlled than international aviation. Ninety percent of world commerce moves on water, though, in 46,000 ships plying 3,000 ports. They carry millions of containers with billions of tons of goods. Roughly half of all international shipping is carried out under ''flags of convenience'' -- registries based in countries like Liberia, often intended to disguise a vessel's true ownership.
 Here in Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, the economy depends on Puerto Cortes, which is about 350 miles south of Cancun, Mexico. More than 100 ships a month leave the port for the United States, carrying everything from bluejeans to bananas, returning with American exports.
 If the United States were to bar ships from the port for even a week, ''our national economy would collapse,'' said Mauro Membreno, chief of Honduras's new National Commission on Port Security.
 The port was a wide-open place, protected mainly by a rusting five-foot-high chain-link fence and a poorly paid police force, until the Honduran government began trying to secure it three months ago. Under an emergency decree, Honduras is spending $4 million to buy computer systems, patrol boats, police cars, cameras and other security gear for Puerto Cortes. ''We have gotten moral support from the United States,'' said the national port director, Fernando Alvarez. ''Nothing concrete.''
 A United States official in Honduras says American pressure to secure Puerto Cortes is intense, but notes that the United States is not paying for security, as it did when it gave Honduras more than $250 million during Central America's anti-communist campaigns in the 1980's.
 ''We've got a gun to their heads,'' the official said. ''If this is the war on terrorism -- well, this is not how we fought the war on Communism.''
 Dennis Chinchilla, Honduras's new national port security officer, said ''the people who work in Puerto Cortes will have to completely change their way of life'' to adapt to the American law. Once the commercial harbor is secured, he said, the law demands that Honduras fix its main tourist port, on the island of Roatan, where 250,000 travelers a year disembark from cruise ships. The security there today is a dollar-an-hour guard in a shack without a phone.
 In the United States, many ports and ships missed a Dec. 31 deadline for submitting security plans. Port authorities note that President Bush's budget for port security in the coming year is $46 million, while the costs of compliance in the United States alone will reach $7 billion.
 The Coast Guard, which must enforce the law, has three people assigned to international compliance, Mr. Flynn said. They confront a tradition of secrecy and deception that makes the maritime trade a tempting target for terrorists.
 Roughly half of the world's commercial ships fly flags of convenience registered in more than two dozen nations, including tiny tax havens and money-laundering centers like the Cayman Islands and Vanuatu. The tradition, which began with United Fruit Company vessels in Honduras in the 1920's, was devised to cut costs and, in many cases, evade taxes.
 ''It's a bit like Swiss banks,'' Mr. Flynn said.
 Flags of convenience ''allow shippers to function with a high degree of anonymity,'' said Rupert Herbert Burns, a senior analyst at the Maritime Intelligence Group, a security firm in Washington.
 Maritime security officials say an American port could be struck in several ways. A cargo ship filled with fuel oil and ammonium nitrate fertilizer could become a waterborne fireball; a ship could carry a radiological ''dirty bomb'' into a harbor; a speedboat carrying explosives could blow up a tanker laden with oil or delivering liquefied natural gas.
 Admiral Loy, citing court testimony and government reports, warned two years ago in the military journal Defense Horizons that Osama bin Laden, through associates using flags of convenience, controlled a fleet of cargo ships, including the vessel that delivered the explosives that blew up American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
 He noted that a month after the Sept. 11 attacks, Italian inspectors found an Egyptian on a ship bound for Canada. The Egyptian, hiding in a shipping container, had a false Canadian passport, a satellite phone, two computers, forged security passes for airports in three countries and papers identifying him as an aircraft mechanic.
 Uncovering such a suspect is like finding a particular shark in a boundless sea. United States officials say the threat of an attack demands that nations like Honduras do their part. But Carl Bentzel, a Democratic counsel to the Senate Commerce Committee, said most of the world's ships and ports ''have so far to go and the costs are so high that most will not be in compliance'' by July 1.
 If that happens, the United States has three choices, maritime security experts say. It can enforce the law, creating potential economic chaos abroad; bend the law, saying economic imperatives make full enforcement impossible; or apply the law selectively, creating a two-tier system in which rich ports in Europe and Asia trump poor Caribbean ones like Puerto Cortes.
 At Puerto Cortes, Fermin Chong Wong, an American-educated computer expert working for the national port authority, is trying to track 400,000 containers and more than 2,000 ships a year.
 ''I don't think there will be enough time to meet the United States requirements everywhere in the world,'' he said. ''I don't think U.S. ports can meet them. Here, we are going to try -- and we might. But the time's too short and the money's too scarce to do all this.'' 
 ''We want to protect our borders,'' said Kim Petersen, who runs one of the world's biggest maritime consultancies, SeaSecure. ''But what happens when we cripple the economy of a developing country and create a breeding ground for the very problems we're trying to prevent?''

HEADLINE: Medicare Overseers Expect Costs to Soar In Coming Decades

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23 

 BODY:
Medicare's financial condition has significantly deteriorated, partly because of exploding health costs and partly because of the new Medicare law, the government reported on Tuesday.
 In its annual report to Congress, the Medicare board of trustees said the program's hospital insurance trust fund could run out of money before the end of the next decade. 
 The trustees have made such projections in the past, but this one was much bleaker than the outlook reported just last year.
 By contrast, the financial outlook for Social Security, though shaky in the long run, changed little from last year.
 John L. Palmer, a public representative on the six-member board, who is also a former dean of the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said: ''The magnitude of the problems is much greater in Medicare. They start sooner, get bigger and will be much more difficult to deal with. The problems of Social Security are manageable, compared with those of Medicare.'' 
 Medicare was already an issue in this year's elections, but in their report, the trustees stepped up the pressure on politicians by saying that Medicare appeared unsustainable in its current form. Democrats, while asserting that the Medicare program was not in crisis, nevertheless said President Bush had aggravated its problems.
 The report comes less than two weeks after the Medicare actuary asserted that the administration ordered him to withhold higher cost estimates for the Medicare legislation last year. 
 The trustees made three blunt statements that highlighted the problems:
 *Under current law, Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund, which pays for inpatient hospital care, will be exhausted in 2019, seven years earlier than forecast last year.
 *Medicare will grow much faster than the economy as a whole, increasing from 2.6 percent of the gross domestic product last year to 3.7 percent in 2010, 7.7 percent in 2035 and nearly 14 percent at the end of the 75-year period commonly used for long-range projections.
 *''Projected Medicare costs would exceed those for Social Security in 2024. By 2078, the level of Medicare expenditures would represent nearly twice the cost of Social Security.''
 The new figures touched off a political brawl between Democrats and the White House.
 ''In just one year, George Bush's reckless policies have sped Medicare seven years closer to bankruptcy,'' said Senator John Kerry, the likely Democratic presidential nominee. 
 Bush administration officials said Medicare's financial problems would be far worse if Democrats had prevailed in their effort to pass drug legislation costing twice as much as the new law.
 The board of trustees consists of four administration officials and two public representatives, Mr. Palmer and Thomas R. Saving, an economist at Texas A&M University.
 In a joint statement, the public trustees said that surging Medicare costs, combined with the new drug benefit, ''raise serious doubt about the sustainability of Medicare under current financing arrangements.''
 Moreover, the full board said, the fiscal outlook may be worse than the official projections indicate, because the estimates are based on the unrealistic assumption that the average Medicare fee for doctors' services will be cut about 5 percent each year from 2006 to 2012, as required under current rules. Doctors say they will lobby Congress to prevent such cuts.
 Though issued by the Bush administration, the Medicare report was prepared mainly by the office of the actuary, Richard S. Foster, a longtime civil servant who recently stirred up a political row when he said he had been ordered to withhold some of his cost estimates from Congress. In the last year, he wrote, ''the financial status of the hospital insurance trust fund has deteriorated significantly.''
 For example, the report says, tax revenues earmarked for the hospital trust fund will fall short of outlays beginning this year, not in 2013, as the trustees predicted last March. Similar shortfalls have occurred in the past.
 Democrats found themselves in a delicate position. They insisted on Tuesday that Medicare was not facing a fiscal crisis, and they said they saw no reason for alarm. But at the same time, Democrats blamed President Bush for Medicare's problems.
 Senator Kerry said Mr. Bush had had an opportunity to shore up Medicare's finances, but squandered it by providing ''tax breaks for the wealthy and a giveaway to prescription drug companies.''
 Trent D. Duffy, a White House spokesman, fired back, saying: ''John Kerry would like to steal the drug benefit away from seniors before they even get it. This president won't allow him to do that. This president has delivered; Democrats have made empty promises for more than a decade.''
 Moreover, Mr. Duffy said that Medicare's financial problems resulted more from rising health costs in general than from the drug benefit proposed by Mr. Bush and approved by Congress last year.
 But the trustees said the drug benefit would be a major factor adding to Medicare's fiscal problems.
 The trustees said that total Medicare spending on the drug benefit would start at $85 billion a year in 2006 and would then grow an average of 9.6 percent a year, to $161.8 billion in 2013. 
 In a separate analysis, the trustees said that the Social Security trust fund would be exhausted in 2042, but that annual costs would exceed tax revenues starting in 2018. Those dates are the same as in last year's report.
 Social Security officials emphasized that the program would not stop paying benefits even under those assumptions. While the assets of the trust fund would be depleted in 2042, they said, tax income would still cover 73 percent of benefit costs.
 Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund, which now accounts for 55 percent of Medicare spending, has been a widely used gauge of the program's financial condition. It fluctuates from year to year.
 Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said: ''The date of insolvency moved forward seven years. By my way of calculating, that's the largest deterioration since we began doing these projections in 1970.''
 Trustees listed several reasons for the worsening condition of the hospital trust fund. Spending was a little higher than expected last year, and payroll tax collections were lower than expected, because of ''very slow growth in wages in 2003,'' the report said. 
 In addition, it said, the new Medicare law will significantly increase costs for the trust fund, ''primarily through increased payments to rural hospitals and private health plans.'' 
 The report is full of complex statistics, but the two public trustees explained their significance. In 2003, they observed, premiums and co-payments for a typical Medicare beneficiary amounted to 15 percent of the average Social Security benefit. By contrast, they said, premiums and co-payments for doctors' services and the new drug benefit will exceed 35 percent of the average Social Security benefit in 2010 and 50 percent by 2030.
 Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, is one of the Medicare trustees, but he said he believed that some provisions of the new law would save more money than the actuary or other budget experts anticipated.
 For example, Mr. Thompson said, new preventive health benefits, greater use of generic drugs and coordinated care for chronic illnesses should save money.
 But Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said he never expected to see those savings. Indeed, he said, the new Medicare law, by ''lavishing billions of dollars'' on private plans, drains the trust fund.

HEADLINE: 'Go-to Guy' Sheds Bureaucrat's Anonymity

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Richard W. Stevenson contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23 

 BODY:
With a parade of cabinet secretaries, the Tuesday meeting of the commission that is investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks hardly lacked star power. But the real star of the show was not even in the room -- Richard A. Clarke, the Bush and Clinton administrations' former counterterrorism chief.
 'I'd like to turn to a subject that everybody else in Washington is talking about,'' said James R. Thompson, a commissioner who is a former Republican governor of Illinois, as he started questioning of Madeleine K. Albright, President Bill Clinton's secretary of state. ''We might as well recognize the elephant in the room.'' 
 He was, of course, referring to Mr. Clarke, who has created a furor in the White House and the Capitol with a new book that accuses President Bush of failing to take the threat of Al Qaeda seriously enough. Mr. Clarke is to testify on Wednesday.
 To colleagues in four administrations, Mr. Clarke was the go-to guy, the senior official who knew the often-arcane workings of budgets and could make the creaky bureaucracy move. Obsessed with averting terrorist attacks on his watch, he was quick to identify threats -- and bully people into addressing them.
 ''He has a certain brilliance,'' said Steven Simon, a counterterrorism expert at the RAND Corporation who worked with Mr. Clarke in the Clinton White House. ''He's the Mozart of bureaucrats.''
 But, Mr. Simon added, Mr. Clarke alienated people who did not always see things his way. ''You know the old saying?'' he said. ''His good points were his bad points.'' 
 Bush administration officials, stung by Mr. Clarke's criticism that President Bush and his aides were slow to move against the Qaeda network and too eager to see the fingerprints of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq on the 9/11 attacks, have sought to discredit him. They have depicted him as a self-promoter, out of the loop and an ally of Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate.
 Mr. Clarke, who says he helped save Americans from state-sponsored attacks from Iraq and Iran and foiled attempts by Al Qaeda to stage attacks, was unbowed. He had anticipated the Bush administration onslaught, saying in his book that its officials are ''adept at revenge.''
 ''They've got lots of people, on taxpayers' dollars by the way, out refuting these charges,'' Mr. Clarke said on Tuesday on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC. ''But they're not really going after the main charge. They're throwing lots of things up in the air, flak, to divert me.'' 
 The man at the center of the maelstrom is a ghostly pale balding bureaucrat who has spent the greater part of a three-decade career in government unknown to most Americans. The son of a chocolate factory worker from Pennsylvania, Mr. Clarke, 53, earned degrees at the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is single, and known for keeping long hours, and he was one of a handful of White House officials allowed to carry a gun for protection. 
 His career and his personal profile have been anything but ordinary. Mr. Clarke, who worked prominently under Republicans and Democrats alike, has had roles in some of the most sensitive foreign policy initiatives of the past generation. 
 His bland official titles, most recently national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection and counterterrorism, followed by special assistant to the president for cyberspace security, belie considerable intrigue. According to biographical accounts and interviews, he drew up plans in 1986 that were never put into effect to ''destabilize'' Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader; coordinated the disastrous American intervention in Somalia and a smoother one in Haiti; and detected Iranian complicity in the Khobar Towers bombing in 1996 in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. 
 For a time, he occupied the office used by Lt. Col. Oliver L. North of the Marines, the Reagan aide whose activities with Iran and Nicaraguan rebels led to the Iran-contra scandal.
 Mr. Clarke is no stranger to scandal. In 1992, he was forced out of a senior position at the Bush administration's State Department and moved to the White House after the inspector general of the department had accused him of looking the other way when Israel transferred sophisticated American military technology to China.
 In an interview in 1999 with The New York Times, Mr. Clarke justified his action, saying the pressure to punish Israel was part of a ploy. ''The bottom line,'' he said, ''was I wasn't going to lie. I wasn't going to go along with an administration strategy to pressure the Israeli government.''
 At the White House, supporters praised his pragmatic style and critics bristled at his propensity to set his own rules. He found a staunch ally in W. Anthony Lake, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser. In his book ''Six Nightmares,'' Mr. Lake called Mr. Clarke ''one of the smartest, most effective public servants I have known.''
 ''He is a bulldog of a bureaucrat,'' Mr. Lake wrote, ''notorious among his colleagues for utter devotion to those he works for, fierce loyalty and support toward those who work for him and a bluntness toward those at his level that has not earned him universal affection.'' 
 As terrorist threats began to multiply, colleagues relied on Mr. Clarke to cut red tape. In November 2000, Robert S. Gelbard, the American ambassador to Indonesia, desperately sought American agents to thwart what he believed was spying for a terrorist attack against his embassy in Jakarta. When Mr. Gelbard ran into bureaucratic roadblocks, Mr. Clarke set up a teleconference and ''browbeat'' officials to action, Mr. Gelbard said. Evidence later showed that the embassy was indeed in terrorists' sights, he said.
 As Mr. Bush prepared to take office in January 2001, Condoleezza Rice, who became national security adviser, decided to keep Mr. Clarke as the counterterrorism expert at the National Security Council. Ms. Rice, who knew Mr. Clarke from her work with President George H. W. Bush, considered him talented, if unruly, and wanted as much continuity as possible on counterterrorism, administration officials said.
 Mr. Clarke was not happy Ms. Rice downgraded him, which resulted in his exclusion from some high-level meetings, the officials said. 
 On March 7, 2001, a senior administration official said, Ms. Rice assigned Mr. Clarke to develop a comprehensive strategy to eliminate Al Qaeda, not just roll it back. His work over the spring and summer was the basis for a strategy document for dealing with the network that won high-level White House approval on Sept. 4. 
 Mr. Clarke, by his own account in the book, was obsessed with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. He relentlessly pressed administration officials for a more assertive policy to combat terrorism, including stronger use of the military. 
 The White House on Tuesday sought to blunt Mr. Clarke's assertions by releasing his resignation letter. In it, he praised Mr. Bush for his ''courage, determination, calm and leadership'' on Sept. 11.
 Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking on Monday on the syndicated Rush Limbaugh radio program, noted there had been several attacks on Mr. Clarke's watch, including the bombings of the Cole and the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in the Clinton years.

HEADLINE: As Gasoline Hits Record Price, Bush, Kerry and Democrats Spar Over Policy and Next Move

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and JOHN TIERNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23 

 BODY:
The record-high price of gasoline has suddenly become one of the most contentious issues here, with presidential candidates and members of Congress rushing to assign blame and propose ways to lower voters' costs at the gas pump.
 As senators called on the Bush administration on Tuesday to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help curb prices, Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, accused President Bush of neglecting energy conservation and favoring oil companies. The Bush re-election campaign blamed Mr. Kerry for voting against oil drilling in Alaska last year and for his past advocacy of higher gasoline taxes. 
 ''It's clear we need a new energy policy,'' Mr. Kerry said. He cited a survey released Tuesday by AAA, formerly the American Automobile Association, showing that the average price for a gallon of self-serve regular unleaded was $1.738. The group said the price was a record, not taking into account inflation.
 Mr. Kerry said, ''We need a balanced energy policy that protects consumers from high gas prices, invests in renewable energy and promotes responsible development here at home.''
 Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, replied, ''The John Kerry complaining about energy costs today must not have checked with the John Kerry who helped block the energy bill last year or the John Kerry who supported a 50-cent tax hike on a gallon of gas.'' 
 Mr. Bush also mentioned that 50-cent tax in a campaign appearance in Florida on Saturday, saying, ''He wanted you to pay all that money at the pump and wouldn't even throw in a free carwash.''
 Mr. Kerry has said in the past that the 50-cent tax was merely an idea floated to reduce the federal deficit in 1992, that he never voted for it and that by the mid-1990's he had decided it was a bad idea.
 He said on Tuesday, in a statement from Sun Valley, Idaho, where he is vacationing, that consumers were paying a ''Bush gas tax'' because prices had increased 11.5 percent during his administration. ''The profits from gasoline sales go to overpaid oil company executives and other countries,'' he added.
 Instead of trying to ''drill our way to independence,'' Mr. Kerry said, the United States should focus on conservation and domestic sources of renewable energy.
 Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats faulted the administration as not responding to ease the price increase. Three Democratic senators, Charles E. Schumer of New York, Barbara Boxer of California and Harry Reid of Nevada, called on the Energy Department to offer petroleum from the reserve to oil companies now, in exchange for repayment in a few months of the original plus interest, paid in oil. The department has used the technique before, and it is attractive at times like this, when prices for delivery in future months are lower than spot prices now.
 Mr. Schumer, citing a prediction that prices would rise about 7 cents a month from now until late summer, said the average family with two cars would soon pay more in extra gasoline costs than it received with the tax credit of $400 per child that was issued in July 2003.
 ''What Uncle Sam has given with one hand, he's allowed OPEC to take away with the other,'' Mr. Schumer said at a briefing for reporters, referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
 Ceasing to fill the reserve, as the members of the House requested on Monday and as the Senate voted March 12 to do, would divert about a million barrels a week to refineries and would presumably push down prices. 
 But oil economists say there would be only a tiny effect on prices because the oil in question is only about 0.15 percent of the world market.
 Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, testifying at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, said that as a matter of national security the administration would continue to fill the reserve. The reserve now holds nearly 650 million barrels, a record, but the level of imports has risen even faster than the reserve has grown.
 Mr. Abraham is far from alone in opposing the release of oil from the reserve. Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit group in New York, said in a telephone interview that the government should not be interfering with prices in a free market. 
 ''This is not tinkering; this is tampering,'' Mr. Goldstein said.
 The reserve should be saved for occasions when its oil is needed to protect the economy, he added, but right now the economy is growing.
 Ms. Boxer, appearing with Mr. Schumer on Tuesday, said: ''Mr. Goldstein would be right if we were dealing with a free market in oil. We're not. OPEC itself constructs supply, manipulates supply and demand to set a price level.''

HEADLINE: Listen to the Germans: Oh, What a Sorry State We're In

BYLINE: By Richard Bernstein

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 23 

 BODY:
''Does nothing work out here besides the separation of garbage?'' the weekly Der Spiegel asked in a recent issue, whose cover article carried the legend, ''Germany: A Joke.''
 ''Even the separated garbage is often mixed together again in the end,'' the article continued, going on to complain that at a time when many people, including senior government officials, speak in terms of national decline, the German Parliament is spending its time passing trivial legislation -- subsidies for commuters, for example, or new rules for deposits on cans.
 Countries experience malaise, as Jimmy Carter once put it of the United States (not to his advantage in public opinion), and Germany is quite clearly in that state now. No less a figure than Helmut Schmidt, the former Social Democratic chancellor, said in a recent interview with the weekly Die Zeit, ''There is almost no area where Germany stands out with its achievements.'' 
 Mr. Schmidt was accused of undue pessimism by Horst Kohler, the departing president of the International Monetary Fund, who is almost certainly going to be elected president of Germany in elections in May. But Mr. Kohler himself, speaking in the same interview, seemed hardly more optimistic. ''German culture, German poets and music are always present,'' he said. ''However, when you talk about the future, about future technology and future knowledge, nobody thinks of Germany first.''
 That is probably true, though it is also probably true that few think of France or China or even Britain in that vein either. Yet those countries do not seem to be in quite the despairing mood that Germany is in. Is the difference perhaps, as some have been saying, Germans just enjoy complaining? Or does it run deeper?
 ''Germany is still the No. 1 exporting country in the world; this hasn't changed,'' Johannes Rau, the country's departing president said a few weeks ago in an interview that caused a great deal of comment. ''We don't have any reason to complain.''
 In a country where unemployment has remained at 10 percent for several years and up to 25 percent in some cities and towns (mostly in the former East) there certainly are, Mr. Rau acknowledged, people whose lives are very tough. ''But,'' he said, ''many people are whining despite having a very high standard of living and a secure source of income, and I don't think that's right.''
 Indeed, a casual observation of daily life in this country supports Mr. Rau's complaint about all the complaining. Berlin, where the cafes are crowded, Philharmonic Hall is always sold out and parades of the larger model BMW's and Mercedes-Benzes take place continuously on the opulent Kurfurstendam and the splendidly refurbished Unter den Linden, does not convey the impression of decline.
 Yet the mood, clearly, is bad. The left-of-center coalition government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has about the lowest poll results of any recent chancellor. If a new election were held now, the opposition conservatives would be swept into power in a landslide. If that does happen in 2006 when elections will be held -- and many political experts believe that it will -- Germany could potentially be following the pattern of the United States after the Carter malaise and Britain in the depressing years before Margaret Thatcher in opting for a conservative revolution.
 Indeed, the leader of the main conservative party, Angela Merkel, is sometimes called Angela Thatcher or Maggie Merkel, reflecting her advocacy of far greater economic reforms than Mr. Schroder has been proposing (though, in fact, Mrs. Merkel does not seem to be as radically free-market oriented as Margaret Thatcher was).
 In the meantime, as President Rau's remark indicates, at least some believe that things are not that terrible and that the danger is that Germans will succumb to a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy of doom. 
 But if other European countries seem less kvetchy than Germany, it could be that they have less to complain about. There are experts here who contend that the pessimism is actually a reasonable response to an objectively bad situation. ''The economic situation is really more of a problem than in other countries because so many shocks have come together,'' said Hans-Werner Sinn, the director of the Institute for Economic Research in Munich. 
 Among the shocks: the reunification of the two halves of the country, which was enormously expensive for the West but has not created an economically viable eastern half; the realization that the country just cannot afford the social-welfare spending that has been among its greatest achievements; and, perhaps most lastingly, the fear that with the imminent enlargement of the European Union, a lot of far cheaper countries to the East -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic states -- are going to draw industries and jobs away from Germany. 
 In other words, Germans are gloomy because there is a general realization that the formulas that have worked so well for this country in the decades after World War II are not working anymore, and nobody knows exactly what to do. It is in that mood of semiparalysis that a conservative revolution seems possible.
 Of course, it is far too early to see if that will happen, and, if it does, it will happen despite a palpable public aversion to Thatcherite reforms. But among experts especially, there is a growing feeling that Germany needs some strong medicine if it is to overcome its difficulties, and strong medicine in Germany would mean something genuinely historic for Europe: a dismantling of the elaborate welfare state in the Continent's biggest and economically most powerful country that would surely reverberate in the other welfare states of Europe.
 ''Germans have awakened from their dreams of the eternal welfare state,'' Mr. Sinn said, explaining the gloomy national mood, and giving it an objective basis. ''They've been confronted with reality, and that is never nice.''


CORRECTION-DATE: April 8, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 24 about a general mood of complaint in Germany referred incorrectly to former President Jimmy Carter's description of a similar mood in the United States in 1979. In a speech that year, Mr. Carter discussed a ''crisis of the American spirit,'' but he did not use the word ''malaise.''.

HEADLINE: Bush and Clinton Aides Grilled by Panel

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON and ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23 

 BODY:
Members of the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks said on Tuesday that a series of intelligence reports sent to President Bush in 2001 warned of an imminent, possibly catastrophic attack by Al Qaeda. The disclosure prompted harsh questioning of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and other administration officials about why they had not done more to pre-empt a possible terrorist strike.
 The Clinton administration's counterterrorism policies were also the subject of sharp questioning at a hearing of the panel, with former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen asked to explain why their colleagues had failed to eliminate the Qaeda network and take Osama bin Laden into custody.
 But the harsher questioning, from Democrats and Republicans alike was reserved for Mr. Rumsfeld, especially after he and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell acknowledged in testimony that they had been aware of intelligence reports in 2001 warning of the especially dire terrorist threat against the United States. 
 The 10-member bipartisan commission is in the final weeks of its investigation. And though the panel has held other hearings in recent months, the questioning Tuesday of four top officials of the Bush and Clinton administrations offered the most exhaustive public examination of diplomatic and military failures in the years before Sept. 11.
 ''There was a good deal of concern,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said, referring to the intelligence warnings shared throughout senior levels of the administration in the months before Sept. 11. ''It was certainly not business as usual.''
 He and Mr. Powell said that the government had spent much of 2001 devising a comprehensive policy not just to contain Al Qaeda, but also to destroy it, even, perhaps, by eventually using ground troops in Afghanistan. Mr. Rumsfeld questioned what more the Bush administration could have done. ''Even if bin Laden had been captured or killed in the weeks before Sept. 11, no one I know believes it would necessarily have prevented Sept. 11,'' he said. [Excerpts, Page A14.]
 President Bush joined in the defense of his administration's performance, telling reporters after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that if ''my administration had any information that terrorists were going to attack New York City on Sept. 11, we would have acted. We have been chasing down Al Qaeda ever since the attacks.''
 The Bush administration has refused to discuss details of the Oval Office intelligence briefings in the months before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The reports, known as the President's Daily Brief, are among the most highly classified documents in the executive branch.
 But under an agreement with the White House last year, one member of the commission, Jamie S. Gorelick, former deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, was allowed to read through a full library of the briefings, and two other commissioners were allowed a partial review.
 Ms. Gorelick said at the hearing Tuesday that information in the documents ''would set your hair on fire, and not just George Tenet's hair on fire,'' referring to the director of central intelligence. 
 Though barred under secrecy regulations from discussing much of what was in the reports, she said that there had been ''an extraordinary spike'' of intelligence warning about Qaeda attacks in the Daily Brief during 2001 and that ''it plateaued at a spike level for months.'' 
 Ms. Gorelick's comments came as the commission released a staff report finding that Mr. Rumsfeld did not order the preparation of any new military plans against Al Qaeda or its Taliban sponsors during the seven months between his arrival at the Pentagon and the Sept. 11 attacks.
 The report said that despite the intelligence alerts throughout the year, there was an impression among specialists at the Pentagon that Mr. Rumsfeld and his new team were ''not especially interested in the counterterrorism agenda.''
 A separate staff report on the government's diplomatic response to the terrorist threat found that Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, and her deputies rebuffed a proposal by aides in early 2001 that the administration step up its support for anti-Taliban rebels in Afghanistan.
 The report said that Ms. Rice had instead spent more than seven months trying to formulate policies to deal with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, policies that were still not in place by Sept. 11 and, White House aides said, might have taken as long as three years to implement.
 Much of the panel's questioning on Tuesday reflected partisan division on the commission, with Republicans harsher in their questions for Clinton administration officials and Democrats tougher on Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Powell. But Republicans joined in asking why the Bush administration had not done more in 2001 to respond to the intelligence suggesting an imminent Qaeda threat and why it had allowed the policy review on counterterrorism to drag on.
 ''What made you think, even when you took over and got these first briefings, given the history of Al Qaeda and its successful attacks on Americans, that we had the luxury even of seven months before we could make any kind of response, much less three years?'' Slade Gorton, a Republican member of the commission and a former senator from Washington, asked Mr. Rumsfeld.
 The defense secretary bristled at the question from his fellow Republican. ''I didn't come up with three years, and I can't defend that number,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said, adding that the administration had been trying at the time of the attacks to come up with a broad strategy to eradicate Al Qaeda. 
 ''I know of no intelligence during the roughly six-plus months leading up to Sept. 11 that indicated terrorists intended to hijack commercial airlines and fly them into the Pentagon or the World Trade Center,'' he said. ''If we had such information, we could have acted on it.''
 The staff reports are expected to become part of the commission's final report this summer, and together they detail how the Clinton and Bush administrations centered much of the government's counterterrorism efforts on fruitless negotiations with the Taliban before and after Sept. 11 to oust Mr. bin Laden from Afghanistan.
 The reports, and some of the testimony on Tuesday, supported elements of the account offered in recent days by President Bush's former counterterrorism chief, Richard A. Clarke. He has said in a new book that President Bush and his deputies, including Mr. Rumsfeld and Ms. Rice, largely ignored the Qaeda threat in the months before the attacks and left the nation needlessly unprepared.
 The staff reports and the testimony on Tuesday offered other new details about the government's efforts in recent years to track down Mr. bin Laden and disrupt his terrorist network, including these:
 *In February 1999, the Pentagon drew up plans to fire cruise missiles at a hunting camp in Helmand province in Afghanistan that Mr. bin Laden frequented, but the strike was called off out of fear it could kill an United Arab Emirates prince who could have been with the Qaeda leader or nearby. ''The lead C.I.A. official in the field felt the intelligence reporting in this case was very reliable,'' one of the staff reports said. ''The field official believes today that this was a lost opportunity to kill bin Laden.''
 *In May 1996, Mr. bin Laden and his associates leased an Ariana Airlines jet and flew to Afghanistan from Sudan, stopping in the United Arab Emirates to refuel. A commission staff report said it was unclear whether the Clinton administration had considered intercepting the Qaeda leader. 
 *In September 1998, Pentagon counterterrorism officials prepared an eight-page strategy paper that urged a ''more proactive and aggressive'' strategy against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Senior Pentagon officials said the strategy was too aggressive and killed it. 
 *In late 2000, Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold, the director of operations for the military's Joint Staff, prepared a comprehensive plan to use military, economic and political efforts to pressure the Taliban to expel Mr. bin Laden from Afghanistan. Senior military and civilian officials said much of the plan was outside the military's scope and sent it back for more work; it was never acted on.
 In his testimony, Mr. Rumsfeld told commission members that he considered Al Qaeda a serious threat before Sept. 11, and that he had been taking steps to prepare the military to combat terrorism, steps like revamping the armed forces into a more mobile, lethal force, and ordering commanders worldwide to update their war plans to be more flexible. 
 But the report prepared by the commission staff portrayed Mr. Rumsfeld as a new secretary struggling with delays in getting his senior aides in place and focused on other priorities, like missile defenses. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld, for instance, never received a briefing from the Pentagon's departing senior counterterrorism expert, the report noted, and counterterrorism aides said ''the new team was focused on other issues and was not especially interested in their counterterrorism agenda.'' 
 In interviews with commission staff members, Mr. Rumsfeld ''did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11,'' the report said. 
 A pivotal decision the Bush administration inherited from the Clinton administration in January 2001 was whether to provide secret military assistance to the Northern Alliance in a last-ditch effort to stave off its defeat by the Taliban.
 In March 2001, the counterterrorism staff of the National Security Council, led by Mr. Clarke, pushed for quick approval of the aid, relatively small amounts meant to block the advance of Taliban and Qaeda fighters.
 But Ms. Rice, the national security adviser, and other top National Security Council aides opposed helping the Northern Alliance alone, arguing that the administration needed a broader strategy to include Pashtun opponents of the Taliban government, the report said. Mr. Clarke warned that delay could imperil the Northern Alliance fighters. 
 Instead, an interagency review process, headed by top national security deputies, worked through the summer to produce a National Security Presidential Directive that was ready by Sept. 4 for Mr. Bush's approval. 
 The strategy had three parts that administration officials said could take three years to carry out. 
 First, it called for a final diplomatic effort to force the Taliban government to give up Mr. bin Laden. If that failed, the administration planned to support a covert action to arm anti-Taliban tribes in Afghanistan and urge them to attack Qaeda bases. If those two steps failed, the administration would use American forces, including ground troops, to overthrow.
 By the end of 2001, American troops and their allies had swept the Taliban out of Kabul.

HEADLINE: After Centuries, The Vegetarian Feast of India Finally Arrives

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
SUVIR SARAN, a chef at the ambitious new Indian restaurant Amma, in Midtown, has never tasted the restaurant's tandoor-grilled lamb chops. ''My family in Delhi have been vegetarians for generations,'' he said. ''At least since the 15th century. Before that we are not so sure.'' Jehangir Mehta, the pastry chef at Aix on the Upper West Side, grew up in Mumbai, where about 30 percent of the 12 million residents are vegetarian. ''The vegetarian cooking of India is excellent training for a pastry chef,'' he said. ''It teaches you how much range can be achieved with spices and herbs.'' 
 India has the most varied vegetarian cooking in the world, and it has been thousands of years in the making. Now, finally, it is also widely available and authentically prepared in restaurants across New York City. 
 Religion, economics, demographics and geography conspired early on to make India one of the most prolifically cultivated regions on earth. Today, there are about 220 million strict vegetarians in India, according to the Anthropological Survey of India. Indian Hindus, Buddhists and Jains all aspire to an ideal of ahimsa, or nonviolence, that prohibits the killing of anything living or with the potential for life (hence, Indian vegetarians eat dairy products but not eggs). 
 Traditionally in India, cooking is intimately entwined with purity, spirituality and caste. ''It's almost impossible to generalize about a country as diverse as India,'' said Rathi Raja, executive director of the Young Indian Culture Group, in Manhasset, N.Y. ''But this much is true: although many of the old ways of religion and class are breaking down, eating vegetarian still has a big place in Indian culture.'' 
 Between 1990 and 2000, New York's Indian-American population more than doubled, according to census figures. The city has also seen an explosion of Indian restaurants at every level, from ambitious, expensive spots like Tamarind on East 22nd Street and Sapphire near Lincoln Center to Midtown steam-table dhabas like Minar. More than ever, New York's Indian restaurants exist to provide desis -- Hindi for countrymen -- with authentic tastes of home, instead of presenting a predictable repertory of Northern-style kormas and biryanis to outsiders. 
 As New York's South Indian population has swelled, the lighter, livelier foods of those regions are being added to the mix. Gujarat, where many of New York City's Indian high-tech workers come from, has a particularly high percentage of vegetarians. ''They are bachelors, these guys,'' said Sridhar Rathnam, the chef and an owner of Madras Cafe in the East Village. ''So they don't know how to cook. And they need restaurants.'' 
 With the arrival here of South Indian vegetarian staples like dosas and uttapams, samosa chat and idlis, Indian cooking in New York is finally reflecting how Indians eat in India. And that often means vegetarian meals at least twice a day, or an entirely vegetarian home kitchen. 
 Indian restaurants outside India have rarely reflected the central role of vegetarian cooking in Indian life, or its varied flavors. Where Americans see ''vegetable curries,'' Indian cooks distinguish among dry and sauced, southern-style (flavored with mustard seeds and curry leaves) and Northern-style (cooked in tomatoes and onions), chili-hot and creamy-cool dishes. To one who eats this way from birth, Mr. Rathnam said, ''a dish that is spicy and sweet tastes completely different to one that is spicy and sour.''
 Part of the craft of Indian vegetarian cooking is composing thalis, plates of rice, bread, dal and cooked vegetables in which the textures and flavors are full of difference and surprise. Even modest establishments like Minar and Dimple present their food with garnishes of crunchy vegetables -- sliced cucumbers, whole fresh chilies, whole radishes -- that are there to provide fresh contrast to the hot food. At Roomali, which just opened on East 27th Street, the vegetarian staple paneer, a fresh cheese, is rolled up in hot roti with shreds of raw red onion. 
 In Ayurveda, the traditional Hindu system of human biology and medicine, foods -- like people -- are either hot or cold, and should be combined accordingly. Additionally, food can be broken down into six flavors -- salty, sweet, sour, bitter, astringent and pungent -- that should be balanced at each meal. Tirlok Malik, an owner of the Ayurveda Cafe on the Upper West Side, said, ''Ayurveda is all about balance.'' At the Ayurveda Cafe, a complete vegetarian thali is composed daily and served in its entirety to each diner (Thali in Greenwich Village and Vatan on Lexington Avenue operate on the same principle). 
 Many Ayurveda practitioners, Jains, Buddhist monks and Krishna worshipers do not eat any onion or garlic -- these pungent foods are considered too ''hot'' and stimulating. It is hard to imagine a vegetarian cook functioning without onions, garlic, scallions, or shallots, but Mr. Rathnam said that vegetarian cooks in India have a much wider range of vegetables to choose from. ''Americans are accustomed to thinking of India as a poor country,'' he said. ''But in Madras you can buy three different kinds of radishes, carrots that are red and yellow as well as orange, all kinds of leafy greens, fresh spices, baby eggplants, shoestring beans, jackfruit and all different kinds of mangoes.'' 
 Nitu Singh, an owner of Minar in Midtown, says that more and more Indian vegetables are available here, and that more customers order them. ''Ten years ago, only Indians ordered okra,'' he said. At Chinese Mirch, a new Indian-Chinese restaurant on Lexington Avenue (Chinese is a popular cuisine in many parts of India), nearly every table holds a mountain of crisp-fried whole okra pods, sprinkled with smoky chili powder.
 Beyond vegetables themselves, rice and bread are integral to vegetarian eating. Especially in South India, the word ''bread'' does not really begin to describe the range of savory pancakes, crepes, doughnuts, and plain and stuffed flatbreads that make quick, filling, savory meals for millions every day. 
 Dosas are lacy, chewy flatbreads, very thin and crisp, with a pleasant sourness that comes from fermenting the rice-and-lentil batter overnight. The dosa can be eaten plain or folded around a filling to make a speedy breakfast that's as integral to Madras as egg and cheese on a roll is to New York. The fundamental filling is the spiced potato mixture known as masala, but there are many variations: mysore (with chili powder sprinkled between the bread layers), butter (extra-thin and buttery), rava (made from wheat instead of rice); and others with onion or cheese sprinkled inside. Listening to Indians order dosas is like listening to Seattle residents order coffee. 
 You can best do this in New York City in Queens, at the Dosa Hutt, the canteen attached to the Ganesha temple in Flushing, where the dosas are smoky from the griddle and brushed with lashings of ghee, or clarified butter. The unrelated Dosa Hut on Lexington Avenue is closed for renovations, but its signature dish, when it returns, should still be the tenderest in Manhattan. Once folded, a normal dosa is about two feet long (a new vegetarian restaurant coming to Manhattan, Saravanas, promises six-foot dosas). 
 Many New Yorkers who have adopted dosas are moving on to idlis, also crafted from rice and lentils but much thicker and fluffier than dosas. When well-made, idlis have the pillowy texture and light tang of the perfect buttermilk pancake. Uttapams are also something like pancakes, but the batter is poured around tomatoes, mushrooms, onions or mushrooms, to make tender, vegetable-studded rounds. 
 Idlis and uttapams are always served with a bowl of sambar, a soupy, tangy tamarind-spiked stew of lentils and vegetables that is synonymous with South Indian cooking. Mr. Rathnam says that in South India, ''we judge a cook by her sambar.'' A cup of creamy-sweet coconut chutney is invariably presented too, to round out the flavors, making this a highly satisfying simple meal. Some of the best idlis in New York are served at Madras Cafe and at Chennai Garden, both vegetarian and kosher-certified restaurants that opened in 1999. Chennai Garden, along with Curry Leaf, has some of the best food in the neighborhood known as Curry Hill, which radiates out from Lexington Avenue and 28th Street.
 At Chennai Garden's lunch buffet last week, visiting engineering students from Hyderabad lined up alongside American Muslim women and kosher-observant New Yorkers like Leah Kahalani. Ms. Kahalani, whose father was a Jewish Indian raised in Mumbai, said the new Indian vegetarian food is the best in the city. ''We used to make samosas for Shabbat dinner when I was growing up,'' she said. ''This cooking is so much more interesting than most vegetarian and kosher food.'' 
 Lavina Melwani, a writer in New York who grew up in Delhi, has been a vegetarian for 15 years and considers the changes in New York's Indian restaurants to be remarkable. ''Now in Midtown you can get a totally traditional chole batura for breakfast,'' she said, referring to a spicy chickpea stew served with crisp, puffy bread, ''and then have a dosa for lunch. When I moved here, there was nothing Indian vegetarians could eat, except for pizza.''
 Pizza is still a staple for New York's Indian-Americans, especially young ones. Singas Famous Pizza, originally a Greek-owned family storefront in Elmhurst, Queens, has become a six-store franchise with a cult following. The distinctive Singas tomato sauce is heavily dosed with fresh jalapenos. The owner of the Hicksville franchise, Jai Jeyasri, said that about 40 percent of his customers are Indian. ''Singas pizza is even too spicy for me,'' he said. ''But I like a mysore dosa.''

HEADLINE: Factory Orders and New-Home Sales Increase

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
New orders for long-lasting factory goods rose sharply in February as demand for aircraft grew, a government report showed yesterday, with new-home sales also surprisingly strong. 
 Orders for big-ticket durable goods -- costly manufactured products expected to last at least three years -- increased 2.5 percent after declining a revised 2.7 percent in January, the Commerce Department said. 
 The number was ahead of forecasts of a 1.7 percent increase, but the underlying trend was disappointing because with transportation removed from consideration, orders declined. 
 In another report, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes rose 5.8 percent -- an increase that was stronger than expected -- to a seasonally adjusted 1.163 million annual pace in February. 
 The sales pace was the fastest since 1.190 million last August and indicates that the housing market continues to draw support from low interest rates, which the Federal Reserve has held at a post-1958 low of 1 percent since last year. 
 In a weekly report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to finance home purchases fell 0.8 percent last week. However, refinance applications edged higher and accounted for more than 60 percent of loan applications processed by lenders last week. 
 A 9.9 percent increase in transportation equipment drove the advance in orders, reflecting the largest increase since July 2002. Excluding transportation, new orders fell 0.3 percent in February -- the first decline in three months. 
 Demand for military aircraft rose 61.1 percent after a 37.3 percent fall in January and civilian aircraft gained 33.8 percent after a 32.5 percent decline. Demand for motor vehicles was up 5.0 percent from a 4.4 percent decline in January. 
 Nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business spending -- were up 1.1 percent in February after dipping 0.3 percent in January.

HEADLINE: Legislator Says Tax Breaks Went to G.O.P. Donors

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 24 

 BODY:
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky charged today that the Pataki administration had let Monroe County officials overseeing a tax-free economic development zone revise its boundaries dozens of times to encompass vacant suburban buildings owned by developers who were big contributors to the county's Republican Party.
 The report from Mr. Brodsky, the chairman of the Assembly's committee on authorities, was another assault from Democratic politicians on how Gov. George E. Pataki and his chief economic development official, Charles A. Gargano, are running the Empire Zone program. It is one of the government's prime tools for encouraging businesses to invest in the state through tax incentives. 
 Mr. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat, said that in 25 cases in 2002 and 2003, the local board that administers the zone gave benefits to developers who owned vacant buildings in Rochester's suburbs, even though they had not promised to create jobs, invest any capital or keep jobs from moving out of state, the main purposes of the tax incentives. 
 He also said that while county officials were handing out these tax breaks, at least 9 of the 19 developers also donated at least $223,000 to the Monroe County Republican Committee. The committee's treasurer, Joseph R. Rulison, a bank executive, is also the chairman of the county Industrial Development Agency and the vice chairman of the board that approves changes to the Empire Zone boundaries. 
 ''There is a strong correlation between the giving of political contributions and decisions to grant taxpayer subsidies to vacant buildings,'' Mr. Brodsky said. 
 The changes to the zone were later approved by Mr. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and one of Mr. Pataki's top fund-raisers. Aides to Mr. Gargano denied that political contributions were a factor when he approved the boundary changes. They said Mr. Gargano regarded breaking up the two-square-mile Empire Zones to cover vacant buildings as a legitimate use of state tax incentives, since it helps landlords attract new employers to the state.
 ''This is just another partisan attack from someone who completely fails to understand how the Empire Zone program works,'' Chapin Fay, a spokesman for Mr. Gargano, said. 
 Mr. Rulison rebuffed the charge that there was a link between campaign contributions and the decisions of the Empire Zone board in Monroe County, which includes Rochester and its suburbs. ''I'm offended by that comment,'' he said. ''That was never, ever, ever a factor.''
 Mr. Rulison said the county had decided to place several vacant buildings inside the Empire Zone to make it easier for developers to attract tenants. Many of the buildings had become vacant because the big employers in Rochester, like Xerox and Kodak, have been shrinking their operations in the city. 
 He said Mr. Brodsky did not understand the county's desperate need to fill those buildings with new employers, and asserted that the developers themselves would get no benefits from being in the Empire Zone, though their tenants might.
 Yet the developers did receive some benefits beyond having a selling point for potential tenants, state economic development officials said. Simply being inside a zone means a developer can avoid paying property taxes on improvements to the buildings and can claim tax credits for the sales tax paid on building materials. 
 Businesses that move into the zone are eligible for other tax breaks if they promise to create jobs, taking much of the cost of local property taxes, wages and investments in new buildings off their state tax bill.
 Begun in 1986, the program was meant to revitalize poor urban areas, but over the years it has been expanded and changed to let local officials tailor it to help businesses in suburban and rural areas as well. Detractors say the incentives amount to welfare for businesses. Defenders say the tax breaks have spurred the creation of new jobs and kept jobs from leaving the state. There are now 72 Empire Zones.
 Mr. Brodsky, who makes no secret of wanting to run for attorney general in 2006, said his review of the operation of the Monroe County zone showed that between July 2002 and October 2003, local and state officials approved 42 changes, spreading the benefits across the county. Among them were the 25 vacant buildings.
 Mr. Brodsky called for an independent investigation into the links between contributions and the decisions of the Monroe County officials. He also questioned how Mr. Gargano could approve boundary changes aimed at helping developers rather than big employers. ''The program was never intended as a tax break for landlords,'' he said.
 County Republican officials, whose party controls the County Legislature and the Empire Zone board, scoffed at the idea they would or could trade tax incentives for contributions. 
 Steve Minarik, the chairman of the county Republican Party, said that 10 of the developers who got the benefits gave nothing to the party. The nine others were longtime contributors to Republican committees who had given a similar amount each year going back to 1995, long before the zone revisions were even contemplated, he said. 
 One of the developers is John L. DiMarco, whose companies gave a total of $74,000 to the county Republican committee between August 2001 and October 2003. During that time, state and local officials decided to place four of his properties inside the Empire Zone. Mr. DiMarco did not return a telephone call from a reporter seeking comment.
 But Mr. Minarik said Mr. DiMarco had donated to the Republicans in previous years as well, ranging from $24,500 in 1999 to $15,250 in 1995. He also gives to Democratic committees, Mr. Minarik said. ''There is no change in the pattern,'' he said.
 Responding to the allegation that there was a Republican cabal controlling the county's Empire Zone, Mr. Minarik laughed. ''I don't even know what the program does,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Paring Away At Microsoft

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The European Commission issued an antitrust ruling against Microsoft yesterday that is intended to force the company to change its fundamental business strategy of bundling new products into its Windows operating system, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers.
 The ruling imposed a $603 million fine. It also required Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without its Media Player and divulge technical information to competitors so that they can create software for business servers that would work well with Windows. [Page C1.]
 The impact on the future of the global software industry may well be greater than on the company's immediate business prospects. 
 The fine is pocket change for Microsoft, which has more than $50 billion in cash in its corporate coffers. The sanctions, according to industry analysts, are not likely to have any significant near-term effect on the computer industry or the market for software that plays music and videos sent over the Internet. And Microsoft executives declared that there would be no changes in their product plans or business practices as a result of the European decision.
 But the ruling could set profound new ground rules for Microsoft in Europe, and perhaps in other markets around the world, as well. 
 If upheld on appeal, it would leave Microsoft with a regulator in Europe standing over its shoulder, scrutinizing what it puts into future generations of Windows and what it leaves out. The antitrust settlement the company reached with the Bush administration in 2001, by comparison, merely gives personal computer manufacturers the ability to place rival software on the Windows desktop, but does not require that Microsoft's bundled software features be removed from Windows. 
 On its own, the European ruling might be seen largely as a nuisance to Microsoft. Yet it comes as other forces are also weakening Microsoft's grip on desktop computers. 
 Beyond the moves to open the Windows desktop to rivals, Microsoft faces growing competition from Linux, an operating system that is distributed free. Even more important, Microsoft's dominance is threatened by a shift in computing from the personal computer to technologies like Internet-connected cellphones and Internet-based services offered by Google and similar companies.
 ''The significance of Europe is not the decision itself, but it adds to the other pressures on Microsoft,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
 Those pressures may be having some effect. There are signs that Microsoft has altered its practices since the settlement with the Bush administration -- and the European ruling could provide a further prod. 
 Industry analysts note that work on the company's next generation of Windows, expected in 2006 or 2007, emphasizes programming code as building blocks, or modules, that can be removed and snapped into the larger program. 
 This approach may be paving the way for the day when Microsoft shifts away from its bundling approach. Skeptics, however, say that Microsoft may be adopting this approach simply because it needs to be able to locate and combat security flaws in Windows more easily. 
 Other analysts say that the Microsoft division responsible for MSN Web sites -- and not the Windows division -- is working to develop a Web search service to compete with Google. To be sure, Microsoft could eventually decide to fold its search software into Windows, as it has with other products in the past. 
 Critics and competitors contend that the company, having long used the bundling strategy to protect and extend its Windows monopoly into other software products, will not significantly change its approach. 
 ''How do you really deter Microsoft from pursuing this bundling strategy when they have bet the company on it?'' asked Andrew I. Gavil, an antitrust expert at the Howard University law school in Washington. 
 Timothy F. Bresnahan, a professor at Stanford University who was chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division during the Clinton administration, said, ''Microsoft sees a new product and says, 'We were about to invent that, too,' comes up with its version and bundles the software into Windows.'' The result, he added, is that ''the early leader in some promising new technology is bundled out of the market.''
 ''It's an innovation tax that is a problem for society,'' Mr. Bresnahan said.
 Bundling was at the center of the federal antitrust suit in the United States, filed in 1998 by the Clinton administration. Microsoft lost the case, but a federal appeals court said the charge that the company engaged in anticompetitive tying should be reconsidered. The Bush administration decided not to revisit the tying claim and settled with Microsoft in 2001.
 Microsoft contends that putting new things into Windows is good for consumers, even if it is bad for some competitors. It was over the bundling issue that settlement talks with the European Commission broke down in Brussels last week.
 For Microsoft, the immovable line in the sand is still its right to add whatever it wants to its dominant product, Windows. ''We believe that every company should have the ability to improve its products in the interests of consumers,'' Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said yesterday in a conference call with reporters. ''We are protecting the fundamental principle of innovation.''
 Microsoft executives say that after the bundling issue was taken off the table in the United States, its competitors sought a more sympathetic audience in Europe. 
 ''This was the core issue during several years of judicial review in the United States,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in an interview. ''The irony is that in Europe the claimants were the very same American companies that had their day in court in the United States.'' 
 The European Commission has ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows stripped of its Media Player within 90 days. And it has told the company that within 120 days it must share more technical information with software competitors in the market for server computers, which run corporate networks. Microsoft said it would seek a temporary halt to both sanctions, while its appeal makes its way through the European courts, a process that is expected to take years.
 Microsoft's leading competitor in media-playing software is RealNetworks, the early front-runner, whose market share has declined sharply since Microsoft began bundling Windows Media Player into its operating system.
 ''This would be a step in the right direction, helping to open up the industry further for competition and innovation,'' said Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks. But even Mr. Glaser has modest expectations for the immediate impact of the European ruling. 
 Instead, he pointed to the long-run importance of challenging Microsoft's bundling strategy. ''If the Windows operating system is seen as completely mutable -- something that anything can be put in -- that doesn't mean there won't be innovation in PC software, but it does tend to inhibit it,'' Mr. Glaser said.
 Under the ruling from Brussels, the pared-down Windows without the Media Player applies only to European markets and does not have to be sold for less than Windows with the Media Player.
 ''If there's no price difference, there will be no impact on PC makers' choices,'' said David M. Smith, an analyst at Gartner Inc. 
 The ruling's demand that Microsoft share more technical information with competitors in the server market, like Sun Microsystems, I.B.M. and others, is intended to ensure that Microsoft does not unfairly extend its monopoly beyond the desktop to the server market. The United States settlement also required that Microsoft share some technical information, but the European order requires that more information be shared. 
 Microsoft contends that the European order amounts to an unwarranted and sweeping grab of its intellectual property rights. It also says the unbundling ruling, if imposed, is an assault on its valuable Windows trademark.
 ''It will be a derivative product that the European Commission is designing,'' Mr. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said. ''It will cause confusion to consumers, and whatever it is, it's not Windows.''

HEADLINE: MTV in Royalty Dispute With Producers in Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, March 24 

 BODY:
Casting themselves as a collective David to an American Goliath, British and other European independent record producers threatened on Wednesday to boycott MTV channels to protest a 55 percent cut in royalties paid for music videos.
 In response, MTV said it would reopen negotiations to look for a way to defuse a problem that erupted this month after it said it would stop broadcasting videos from companies that refused to accept the reduced royalty payments.
 Unlike in the United States, where MTV does not pay for video clips from independent producers, European independents, who account for about 21 percent of the Continent's $12 billion music industry, regard royalties for video clips as a significant source of money to promote often innovative music and little-known musicians.
 But when a four-year deal worth about $3.5 million a year (at current exchange rates) expired in 2002, MTV broke off negotiations with an industry royalty collection company called Video Performance Limited, or V.P.L., and offered reduced payments to individual producers, according to the Association of Independent Music, the industry body. The new offer was worth $1.55 million a year, the association said. 
 The dispute affects record producers like Beggars Banquet, Telstar, Ministry of Sound and Independeniente, representing musicians and bands like Travis, Craig Davis, Prodigy, Carla Bruni and the White Stripes. In an open letter on Wednesday to MTV Networks Europe -- the European subsidiary of MTV, which is owned by Viacom in New York -- 288 independent producers called the new terms ''totally unacceptable.'' Only 35 independent companies had reportedly signed up with MTV for the reduced royalties.
 And at a news conference in London, representatives of some independent recording labels said they would withdraw their videos from MTV on March 31, the deadline set by MTV for individual independents to accept its new royalty offer.
 ''MTV are the bully boys in the playground,'' said Katherine Bell, a manager of Chrysalis Music Group, which represents composers. ''MTV wouldn't exist without music, and yet it does not respect the very people who make music.''
 ''MTV is owned by a vast U.S. conglomerate,'' she added. ''They are attempting to undermine British and European creativity by failing to give recompense for their endeavors.''
 That theme was echoed at the news conference by others like Paul Kernick of Sanctuary Records, who said MTV was ''devaluing music and it's not a deal we can subscribe to.'' Jonathan More, a disc jockey and founder of Ninja Tune, an independent record producer, said of MTV's negotiating tactics, ''It's a kind of Mafia way: do as we say, or the videos are going to get it.''
 The objections, moreover, seemed aimed directly at the perceived business practices of the American owners of MTV Networks Europe.
 ''Our U.S. cousins have not learned from history,'' said Fran J. Nevrkla, chairman of V.P.L., which had been negotiating with MTV. ''The world does not like to be bullied, marginalized, humiliated. It really doesn't go down awfully well.''
 In specific terms, the independent producers argued that while MTV wanted to reduce its royalty payments and make no provision for inflation-linked increases, the number of its channels had grown to include several new outlets, like MTV Dance, VH1 Classic and VH2. ''All this adds up to more programming for less money,'' the Association of Independent Music said. 
 MTV Networks Europe reaches more than 110 million homes and has expanded rapidly.
 Independent producers also challenged an assertion by MTV that the promotional value of videos being played on its channels offset any direct financial loss.
 Some said that individuals did not feel a need to buy music played frequently on television. ''When music is so easily available on tap, why should people buy records?'' said Lohan Presencer, managing director of Ministry of Sound.
 After the news conference, Brent Hansen, president and chief executive of MTV Networks Europe, made public his own letter to the independent producers, insisting that ''we still fundamentally believe that collective licensing does not serve the best interests of independent labels as they relate to MTV.''
 ''However in the interests of supporting the issues that the indies have raised and in a genuine effort to reach a resolution, we have decided to return to the negotiating table with the V.P.L.''
 Alison Wenham, chief executive of the Association of Independent Music, said. ''I think that the attempt by MTV to divide and rule the sector has backfired.''

HEADLINE: In their hiring of teachers, do the nation's public schools get what they pay for?

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel is the author of ''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness'' (HarperCollins).

 BODY:
PUBLIC-SCHOOL teachers just aren't as smart as they used to be. After all, women have more job opportunities. Bright women who once would have taught school today become doctors and lawyers. The gain for individual women is a loss for education.
 Or so many people believe. The story is plausible, but is it true? As a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, the economist Sean P. Corcoran wondered just that. ''The more I started to think about it, the more I started to think that it wasn't really a given that teacher quality has fallen over time,'' he said in an interview. 
 Women make up about three-quarters of teachers 25 to 34 years old, a proportion that has remained fairly constant since the early 1960's.
 As women's job opportunities have increased, so has the chance that they'll go to college. Even women near the top of their high school classes are twice as likely to earn a college degree today as in the early 1960's.
 That might swamp the effects of greater opportunities outside teaching. So what did really happen to teacher quality?
 The first problem is to define ''quality'' in a measurable way. Research over the last decade has demonstrated that teachers' aptitude test scores, particularly their verbal scores, are the best predictors of how their students will achieve.
 ''If we think of teacher quality as those things that matter for student outcomes, then these test scores seem to be a pretty good measure,'' said Professor Corcoran, who is now at California State University, Sacramento. With William N. Evans and Robert M. Schwab of the University of Maryland, he analyzed the test results and career choices of individuals in five high school classes, from 1964 to 2000. All five surveys include math and verbal aptitude tests and follow the students over time, allowing the researchers to match students' test scores with their eventual occupations.
 (A short version of the paper will be published in this summer's American Economic Review as part of the Papers and Proceedings of the American Economic Association's 2004 meetings. A longer version is forthcoming in The Journal of Policy Analysis and Management. The paper is online at http://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/corcorans/research.htm.)
 The results both confound and support the conventional wisdom. Through the entire period, the average female teacher scores below the average female college graduate. But the teacher score falls only modestly over time. On average, teachers score about the same today as they did a generation ago.
 But averages hide the real story. The best female students -- those whose test scores put them in the top 10 percent of their high school classes -- are much less likely to become teachers today.
 ''Whereas close to 20 percent of females in the top decile in 1964 chose teaching as a profession,'' making it their top choice, the economists write, ''only 3.7 percent of top decile females were teaching in 1992,'' making teachers about as common as lawyers in this group.
 So the chances of getting a really smart teacher have gone down substantially. In 1964, more than one out of five young female teachers came from the top 10 percent of their high school classes. By 2000, that number had dropped to just over one in 10.
 The average has stayed about the same because schools aren't hiring as many teachers whose scores ranked at the very bottom of their high school classes. Teachers aren't exactly getting worse. They're getting more consistently mediocre.
 Professor Corcoran and his co-authors assume that the brightest young women don't become teachers because other jobs have opened up to them. But new research by Caroline M. Hoxby, a Harvard economist, and Andrew Leigh, a doctoral student at Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, suggests a more complicated story here, too.
 High-scoring women aren't the only women with greater opportunities today. All sorts of jobs, including those that require only average abilities, have narrowed the gender pay gap over the last generation. ''We see the doctors and lawyers,'' Mr. Leigh said in an interview, ''but I don't think we're as aware that the same thing has happened to bookkeepers.''
 He and Professor Hoxby examine the effects of two different trends: changes in the ratio of male and female pay across all professions and changes in the level of unionization among teachers. Unionization tends to compress the range of salaries, raising the average but reducing the premium to top teachers.
 To separate the two effects, they divide teachers by state, since both pay-equity and unionization laws changed at different times in different places. Surveys with individual test scores aren't large enough to break down by state, so the economists use a larger data set that records where each person went to college. As a proxy for each woman's aptitude, they use her college's mean combined SAT score. 
 (The paper, ''Pulled Away or Pushed Out? Explaining the Decline of Teacher Aptitude in the United States,'' which will also be published in the American Economic Review's Papers and Proceedings issue, is available at http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/hoxby/papers.html.) While imperfect, this measure isn't correlated with either unionization rates or pay equity, so it's good enough to answer the researcher's question: Are women from top colleges leaving teaching because of the ''pull'' of better pay elsewhere or the ''push'' of reduced earnings at the top of teaching?
 To their surprise, they find that wage compression explains a huge 80 percent of the change. If women from top colleges still earned a premium as teachers, a lot more would go into teaching.
 ''Women who went to a top 5 percent college earned about a 50 percent pay premium in the 1960's and earn about the same as other teachers today,'' Mr. Leigh said. ''By comparison, somebody who went to a bottom 25 percent college earned about 28 percent below the average teacher in the 1960's, and they have the earnings of about the average teacher today.''
 In hiring teachers, we get what we pay for: average quality at average wages.

HEADLINE: Europeans Rule Against Microsoft; Appeal Is Promised

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER; Matt Richtel in San Francisco contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 24 

 BODY:
European regulators ruled on Wednesday that Microsoft broke European Union law by using its ''near monopoly'' in the Windows operating system to squeeze out rivals in other kinds of software.
 The penalty, which came after five years of investigation, consultations and negotiations, went well beyond what the United States Justice Department ultimately agreed to in its antitrust case brought in the late 1990's. 
 The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, ordered Microsoft within 90 days to offer a version of Windows with its media-playing software stripped out. The commission also gave the company 120 days to disclose the necessary information about Windows to rival makers of software for computer servers to allow them to design products that work as easily with Windows as Microsoft's own server software. And it fined Microsoft 497 million euros ($603 million), its largest fine ever. 
 The Justice Department said late Wednesday that it was concerned about the European action. ''Sound antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by 'dominant' companies,'' R. Hewitt Pate, assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, said in a statement. 
 Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, said it would appeal the ruling to the European courts. Such an appeal could take as long as five years, and the company said it would also ask for a suspension of the commission's penalties days after filing its appeal. 
 The European decision is ''an unfortunate step and it's an unnecessary step,'' said Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, noting that the Justice Department had already spent five years addressing similar issues. 
 The ruling, if it survives an appeal, can be expected to change the way the company does business in the European Union, a market for Microsoft of more than $3 billion that is soon to include 25 countries. And it may make Microsoft more vulnerable to antitrust litigation in the future.
 Mario Monti, the European Union's competition commissioner, said he was ''confident we have produced a decision that can withstand an appeal.''
 ''If future cases do materialize,'' Mr. Monti added, ''they will benefit from this precedent.'' 
 While a number of Microsoft's competitors declined to comment, others hailed the European ruling. 
 Matthew Szlulik, chief executive of Red Hat, a company that competes with Microsoft in software for desktop computers and servers, said: ''This sends a clear message to the international and European marketplaces that innovation and choice really matter. As the E.U. looks forward, they are going to create an environment that inspires competition and leads to better products and lower prices.''
 The most important aspect of the ruling concerned Microsoft's bundling of its media-playing software in Windows, a practice the commission calls tying.
 ''Tying harms competition because it prevents a lot of high-quality alternatives from being available,'' Mr. Monti said, adding: ''Media players are separate products from operating systems. There is separate demand for them.'' 
 Under the commission's order on Wednesday, Microsoft may still sell a version of Windows with Media Player in European Union countries, but this bundled version must not be favored in any way over the unbundled one. The commission did not order Microsoft to sell the unbundled version of Windows at a discount to the version with Media Player attached -- an essential requirement for restoring competition, according to computer analysts and lawyers.
 ''If the commission's remedy allows Microsoft to sell the two versions of Windows at the same price, then that's a problem,'' said Thomas Vinje, a competition lawyer in Brussels with the law firm of Clifford Chance, who represents one of Microsoft's strongest adversaries on both sides of the Atlantic, the Computer and Communications Industry Association.
 Mr. Monti said in an interview he was convinced that offering different versions of the operating system would open the market for media players.
 David R. Stewart, deputy general counsel for RealNetworks, an important Microsoft competitor in this area, said the decision was ''a great step toward leveling the playing field'' for media players.
 The requirement that Microsoft disclose information about Windows to rival server software makers so they can design products involves only information on how Windows works with other applications -- so-called interface documentation -- and not the operating system's source code, the commission said.
 Sun Microsystems had prompted the European antitrust case with its complaint to the commission about Microsoft in 1998. On Wednesday, Sun's vice president for legal affairs, Lee Patch, said, ''This decision is important for consumers not only in Europe, but also for increased innovation and competition worldwide.''
 Mr. Patch continued: ''The remedy concerning interoperability will result in a wave of new competitive products on the market. Users will be able to mix and match software from different vendors. They'll be able to choose the best product on the market, then six months later take advantage of the choice to pick the best product at that particular time.''
 Mr. Szlulik of Red Hat said he expected to have new products in the market six to nine months after Microsoft made its technical standards available.
 But many big Silicon Valley companies that have been both rivals and partners of Microsoft declined on Wednesday to comment on the European Commission's ruling, among them Apple Computer, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Intel.
 Mr. Smith, the Microsoft general counsel, said the company would request an appeal of the ruling at the European Court of First Instance within 70 days, seeking to reverse it. The commission, he said, ''isn't just freezing Windows development, it is taking consumers backward.''
 It is ordering ''the broadest compulsory licensing of intellectual copyright since the founding of the European Union more than 50 years ago,'' Mr. Smith added.
 Although a suspension of the commission's ruling pending an appeal is likely, it is not certain. The commission will argue against granting a stay on the basis that the monopoly abuse is continuing and that the Microsoft dispute is the most serious antitrust case the European Union has had, a spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said. 
 Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said that a settlement offer the company proposed last week would have been better for consumers and for the software industry. He added that Microsoft still hoped to resume negotiations with the commission.
 The company declined to say exactly what it had offered Mr. Monti in the settlement talks last week. In an interview, Mr. Smith said the offer included bundling two rival media players in with Microsoft's Media Player in the Windows operating system. He said the company also offered to divulge all the necessary information about Windows that the commission was seeking to restore fair competition in the server software market.
 In addition, Microsoft offered to put the changes into effect worldwide. The commission's decision applies only in Europe.
 He declined to address how Microsoft could meet the commission's desire to establish a precedent in having a say over future products. 
 One lawyer close to Microsoft said it ''tried to meet this demand part of the way'' by offering to consult the commission about future plans to add software products to the Windows operating system. But a top antitrust official working on the case said this fell short of what regulators were looking for.
 ''The commission was quite indifferent as to whether the case was settled or ruled on, as long as the equivalent of a precedent was made,'' the head of the antitrust team, Philip Lowe, said. 
 Microsoft ''proposed that we should accept an agreement whereby they would say 'if problems arise, come back and see us,'" Mr. Lowe said, adding, ''We couldn't agree to that.''
 Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has argued cases against Microsoft, said that the position taken by the Europeans means that regulators there have a chance to preserve competition, while American regulators have reacted too slowly.

HEADLINE: 14 States Ask U.S. to Revise Some Education Law Rules

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24 

 BODY:
Fourteen states asked the Bush administration on Wednesday for permission to use alternative methods for showing academic gains under the No Child Left Behind law.
 The 14 states, most of which had their own systems for raising academic performance in place before the federal No Child Left Behind law took effect two years ago, charged that as currently written, the law would brand too many schools ''in need of improvement,'' and thus squander limited resources.
 The states, including Alaska, California and Connecticut, said that schools showing academic gains under their statewide system should escape the failing designation under the federal law, even if that progress falls short of the law's requirements. 
 They asked for permission to use ''growth models,'' in which schools would avoid the federal law's remedies and penalties if they showed academic gains, even if those gains fell short of the amount required for all students to reach academic proficiency by 2014, as the law mandates. 
 In a letter to Education Secretary Rod Paige, the 14 chief state school officers wrote that ''without any changes to the law, calculations suggest that within a few years, the vast majority of all schools will be identified as in need of improvement. Many of those schools will be given that designation despite having shown steady and significant improvement for all groups of students.''
 The appeal comes as more and more states have passed resolutions criticizing No Child Left Behind, and the federal Education Department has moved to give states greater flexibility in carrying out the law. In recent months, Dr. Paige has relaxed some of the law's more stringent requirements on the testing of children who are learning English and disabled children, as well as provisions demanding that schools hire only teachers who are qualified for the subjects they are teaching.
 The state education chiefs acknowledged that the changes they were requesting could not be accommodated within the current law, and asked for Congress to revise the law -- something that Congress appears unlikely to consider this year.
 Under the federal education law, states must show steady progress toward all students reaching proficiency by 2014. Schools must break down results by grade, economic level, ethnicity and disability, with a specific percentage of students in each subgroup required to achieve grade-level performance until -- at least theoretically -- all would do so by 2014.
 Schools in which any subgroup of students, in any grade, fail to reach the mark fall short under the federal law. Two years of doing so means the schools must offer children the option to transfer to a school that is not failing, and pay their transportation costs. After three years, they must offer private tutoring. And after five years, the school can face closing and new management.
 ''We have limited resources,'' said Jack O'Connell, California's superintendent of public instruction. ''To divert it to things like busing doesn't make sense to us.''
 Eugene Hickok, acting deputy secretary for elementary and secondary education, said the kind of changes California and the other states are seeking could be granted only if the law were revised. He also said estimates that the vast majority of schools would be deemed sub par were probably overstated. 
 While acknowledging ''some merit'' to Wednesday's suggestion, Mr. Hickok said that he did not support revising the education law. Doing so would ''open up opportunities for all kinds of problems. There are lots of people who would like to revisit the statute to gut it.''
 The schools chiefs also came under immediate fire from the Congressional architects of the law, including Representative George Miller of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
 Under the growth model that California was proposing, Mr. Miller said: ''They are sort of always arriving, but they never get there. We want all of our fourth-grade children to be proficient in reading and math and other subjects. Growth alone can't be good enough.''
 Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the education committee, also had harsh words. ''These changes would gut the No Child Left Behind Act and make it easier for states to go back to hiding the fact that some children are being denied a quality education, even as those states accept billions in increased federal education funds,'' he said. ''It's a very bad idea, and it doesn't seem to have attracted much support on either side of the aisle in Congress.''
 In addition to Alaska, California and Connecticut, the states that signed the letter were Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington.

HEADLINE: Euro Declines On Speculation Of a Rate Cut

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: LONDON, March 24 

 BODY:
The euro had its biggest drop in three weeks against the dollar on Wednesday after Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, fed speculation that the bank would cut its benchmark interest rate to bolster a flagging recovery.
 Policy makers may lower their economic growth forecasts if consumer demand fails to accelerate in the 12 nations that use the euro, Mr. Trichet told the business daily Handelsblatt in Germany late on Tuesday. Higher returns on deposits and bonds in Europe have helped the euro rise almost 15 percent against the dollar in the last 12 months. 
 The euro slid to $1.2127 on Wednesday from $1.2338 late Tuesday. 
 ''Should our expectations for stronger private household consumption and domestic demand as a whole not be fulfilled, we would change our forecasts accordingly,'' Mr. Trichet said in the interview.
 Mr. Trichet's statement was ''so well crafted that one can interpret it as verbal intervention'' intended to push the euro lower, said David Durrant, chief currency strategist for Bank Julius Baer in New York. 
 The rate on the Euribor interest rate futures contract for April, when the central bank is scheduled to meet next, fell 0.05 percentage point after Mr. Trichet's comments, to 1.95 percent, suggesting that traders were increasing their bets that the bank would reduce its benchmark interest rate from 2 percent by then. 
 Another member of the central bank council also signaled that interest rates might be cut. ''Some ammunition'' is still available on interest rates, Guy Quaden, who is on the council and is the governor of the central bank of Belgium, told Le Monde, the French newspaper. Mr. Quaden said that he did not want a higher euro.
 The European Central Bank's benchmark rate is twice the Federal Reserve's target lending rate. Most economists say the Fed's next move will be to raise rates, which would increase the lure of dollar-denominated financial assets.

HEADLINE: Russia's Future, Putin's Legacy

BYLINE: By Sergei Guriev. 
Sergei Guriev is an assistant professor at the New Economic School in Moscow.

 BODY:
Although most independent observers agree that last week's presidential election in Russia was unfair, there is little doubt that Vladimir V. Putin would have won re-election by a landslide even in an honest election. That's because a campaign slogan used to great effect in America 12 years ago -- ''It's the economy, stupid'' -- also holds true in Russia.
 An economic record similar to Mr. Putin's would assure the incumbent's re-election in almost any democratic country. By almost any measure, the record is outstanding. 
 Despite the global economic slowdown, Russia's gross domestic product has grown spectacularly during his tenure, at an average rate of 6.5 percent annually. Mr. Putin has presided over four consecutive years of budget and trade surpluses. Foreign debt has declined to 30 percent from 50 percent of G.D.P.; foreign currency reserves have tripled, and now exceed annual imports.
 Meanwhile, capital outflow has finally come to a stop. Last year Moody's Investors Service upgraded Russian bonds to investment grade; the other two major rating agencies are expected to follow later this year. The stock market is still narrow, but its performance has been impressive: since Mr. Putin took over, the main market R.T.S. index has increased sevenfold in dollar terms.
 And contrary to conventional wisdom, the benefits of this growth have reached beyond the rich. The average Russian household is now 53 percent better off in real terms than four years ago; real wages are up 86 percent. Inequality is still very high, but poverty and unemployment have declined by a third. About one in four Russians now has a mobile phone, up from about 0.5 percent of the population four years ago, and the number of Internet users has tripled. Real estate prices have doubled in dollar terms, and car ownership has increased by 10 percent.
 To what extent can Mr. Putin take credit for this success? Certainly, he has been exceptionally lucky. Oil prices have been extraordinary high during his tenure, and according to various estimates, rising oil prices account for half to two-thirds of Russia's recent economic growth. In addition, when Mr. Putin took over, the Russian economy was at a low point, with all the foundations for a quick recovery -- undervalued ruble, cheap labor, unused capacity -- in place.
 Yet Mr. Putin has played a strong hand well. His economic policies have been consistent and predictable. Mr. Putin's foreign policy has helped Russia become more integrated in the world economy, and will pay even greater benefits in the coming years with an increase in foreign investment and Russia's acceptance into the World Trade Organization.
 Perhaps most important, Mr. Putin's administration has not surrendered to powerful interest groups -- especially regional governors and big business. Four years ago these groups seemed invincible, but Mr. Putin has managed to play them against each other. In virtually all parts of Russia, for example, Mr. Putin's popular support is probably higher than that of the regional governor.
 Mr. Putin's strategy toward the so-called oligarchs has been more controversial. The vast majority of Russian voters deem oligarchs' wealth illegitimate. Expropriating the oligarchs' wealth, however, would destroy investment incentives in a large part of the Russian economy. According to various surveys, the oligarchs (who own the 20 or so largest business conglomerates) control at least a third of Russia's industrial output -- more than all other private owners combined.
 Moreover, these groups control the very same natural resource companies that have been the engine of Mr. Putin's economic growth. Hence, Mr. Putin had to choose between undermining capitalist values (mainly secure property rights) or democratic values (mainly the respect for the views of the majority). Mr. Putin's approach was as pragmatic as it was cynical.
 In 2000, Mr. Putin struck an informal deal with oligarchs: the Kremlin would respect their property rights if they supported the Kremlin's position in federal and regional politics. This deal has indeed provided the oligarchs with sufficient incentives to invest their export revenues in Russia, restructure their assets and create new jobs. It has also eliminated any remaining domestic opposition to the president.
 The public's antipathy toward the oligarchs, meanwhile, was simply used as a threat to enforce the deal -- a threat that was proved to be credible when Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested last year.
 Mr. Khodorkovsky had become a champion of modern corporate governance, restructuring his oil company, Yukos, and making it more transparent and efficient. The company became one of Russia's largest investors and taxpayers, and Mr. Khodorkovsky and his partners donated money to schools, universities and other charitable projects.
 None of this helped him, however, when Mr. Khodorkovsky began to support parties other than Mr. Putin's. The retaliation was swift and not necessarily respectful of the law. Yet there was little public outcry over the Kremlin's tactics because Mr. Khodorkovsky is still disliked by about three-quarters of Russian voters.
 By now, nobody has any illusions about Mr. Putin's respect for property rights or democratic values: he simply pays them lip service in order to consolidate his power. With last week's election, this task is finally accomplished. Mr. Putin now rules free from any campaign promises or political obligations. Political opposition is almost nonexistent. In contrast to his position four years ago, the president can finally pursue whatever agenda he wishes.
 Assuming that Mr. Putin genuinely wants to build a new, stronger Russia, can his second term be as economically successful as his first? Russia can still continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate, even if oil prices fall. The Russian economy is rich in natural resources and human capital, and Russian firms have grown more efficient at exploiting them. Foreign debt is low, reserves are high, and Russia can bridge whatever deficits arise by borrowing abroad at low rates.
 Long-term economic growth, however, can no longer come from the natural resource industries. Although they have performed well in recent years, they may have reached their peak. And to make the manufacturing and services sectors competitive, Russia must carry out several structural reforms, in both the educational and financial systems, that have been delayed during Mr. Putin's first term.
 A prerequisite for these reforms is an honest, competent and accountable bureaucracy. Unfortunately, the Russian bureaucracy has always been notoriously inefficient and corrupt -- and that didn't change during Mr. Putin's first term. While he recognizes the need to reform the bureaucracy, he is facing an enormous challenge: the bureaucracy will not willingly release its grip on the Russian economy, and Mr. Putin has alienated or weakened many reform-minded elements in society that might have been willing to help him.
 In 2001, when asked about his vision for Russia in 2010, Mr. Putin said: ''We will be happy.'' His first term has certainly delivered its share of economic happiness. But the very strategy Mr. Putin used to achieve such success in his first term may make it more difficult for Russia to complete the quest during his next term.

HEADLINE: A Slayer of Monopolies, One Corporation at a Time

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 24 

 BODY:
When Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, arrived in Brussels early last week to negotiate with the European Commission over its antitrust case, lawyers involved in the talks said they believed that a settlement was within reach. 
 But Mario Monti, the commission's chief antitrust enforcer, insisted on provisions that would constrain Microsoft from future behavior like the current practice of bundling its Media Player into Windows.
 Microsoft, a lawyer representing the company in the case, said, was ''absolutely astonished.''
 Still, he said, Mr. Ballmer did not reject the demand outright. After two days of trying to close the gap, however, the company was not willing to expand the scope of the agreement enough to suit Mr. Monti. 
 Mr. Monti has stalked plenty of big corporate game in his five turbulent years overseeing antitrust enforcement for the European Union. With his term in Brussels coming to an end this fall, his latest trophy, Microsoft, is without a doubt his biggest.
 The European Commission's ruling against Microsoft, issued here on Wednesday, brands the company as an abusive monopolist, and imposes remedies on it that go much further than those negotiated between Microsoft and the Justice Department three years ago. 
 Brussels also hit Microsoft with a fine of 497 million euros ($603 million), the largest it ever imposed on a single company in an antitrust case. But the money, both sides agree, pales in comparison to the message.
 Europe continues to chart an aggressive course in regulating the behavior of big corporations, despite the more laissez-faire approach in the United States under the Bush administration and despite a series of legal setbacks that many predicted would blunt Mr. Monti's hard-charging style.
 ''It's hard to argue he's pulled his punches,'' said Joe Simons, a former chief of the competition bureau at the Federal Trade Commission in Washington. ''Microsoft is about as big a thing as you can bite off.''
 For Mr. Monti, a courtly, silver-haired former economics professor from Milan, the Microsoft case is also something of a bookend to the commission's landmark decision in 2001, when it blocked General Electric's planned $45 billion takeover of Honeywell. 
 That decision, which came after bruising negotiations with G.E.'s former chairman, John F. Welch Jr., and despite intense pressure from Washington, brought Mr. Monti sudden notoriety. An obscure European bureaucrat had thwarted one of America's leading industrial empires.
 Now, Mr. Monti, 61, has taken on arguably the leading American technology company, and has again refused to settle, despite face-to-face negotiations with Mr. Ballmer.
 ''We wanted a settlement which would set clear principles concerning the future conduct of Microsoft, to avoid going back to these sort of abuses,'' Mr. Monti said in an interview. ''They were not prepared to do this. We had to agree that on this point, we disagreed.''
 Mr. Monti's critics said the ruling perpetuated the European Union's tendency to take a more restrictive approach to business.
 ''There is still a broad gulf between competition policy in Europe and the United States,'' said William Kolasky, a former antitrust official in the Justice Department who had criticized the G.E.-Honeywell ruling.
 ''European agencies come from a more corporatist perspective,'' Mr. Kolasky said. ''There really is less stomach in Europe for the kind of Darwinian competition that we've embraced'' in the United States, he added.
 Still, Mr. Kolasky noted that the Microsoft case did not arouse the same invective from Washington as did the G.E.-Honeywell case. In contrast to the earlier reaction, the Justice Department issued a relatively mild statement Wednesday after the European ruling noting that it may produce ''unintended consequences.''
 Mr. Kolasky attributed that restraint in part to the fact that the Justice Department had itself already gone toe-to-toe with Microsoft. At the same time, he noted that Washington was eager not to antagonize Brussels right now.
 While Mr. Monti may take a harder line than American regulators these days, legal experts say he has actually brought Europe closer to the United States in the way it prosecutes antitrust cases.
 ''There is a marked convergence,'' said James F. Rill, a former director of the antitrust division in the Justice Department. ''That has to be a large part of the legacy of Mario Monti.''
 None of this mollified Microsoft, which said the commission's ruling would stifle innovation and deprive consumers of choices. If the ruling survives legal challenge, the company will be required to offer PC manufacturers a version of its Windows operating system stripped of its multimedia software, Media Player.
 Microsoft had offered to sell Windows with three rival media-player programs already installed. The company's general counsel, Brad Smith, said that would have resulted in Microsoft's distributing 300 million copies of competing programs a year for the next three years.
 ''This gives consumers less value for their euros,'' Mr. Smith said in a conference call with reporters. ''It is crystal clear that it would have been far more productive to reach a settlement last week.''
 Even some experts who question Microsoft's practices cautioned that Brussels's move could set bad precedents.
 ''Once regulators get their bit in their teeth and realize they can regulate, they may not stop with the bad actors,'' said Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley research firm. 
 Mr. Monti, lawyers for Microsoft suggested, may have felt emboldened to take a tougher stance at the 11th hour by the endorsement of his ruling by all 15 of the European Union's countries. 
 ''I can't figure out any other explanation for it, except that he wanted to make a grand public gesture,'' said one lawyer close to Microsoft. 
 Mr. Monti said the notion of setting a precedent for Microsoft's future behavior was not new. He would have been willing to delay the ruling, he added, if he had sensed that Microsoft was moving in his direction.
 Mr. Monti's muscular performance on Microsoft positions him for a prominent future role in Europe, even after his term expires. He said he would be willing to serve another term in Brussels if nominated by the Italian government. Insiders say he could be up for the post of commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, which is expected to be vacated by Pedro Solbes of Spain.
 By spurning a settlement with Microsoft, Mr. Monti has bequeathed this case to his successor. Microsoft plans to appeal the ruling to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Some analysts predict that the company, as it did in the United States, will work out a deal only after a court ruling.
 Mr. Monti seemed unconcerned about leaving behind unfinished business, saying that was inevitable in a big institution.
 Some of Mr. Monti's comfort may stem from the fact that after a rocky period during which his staff came under criticism for inadequate and even slipshod legal work, his office has rebuilt its reputation.
 After a European court overturned three of the commission's vetoes of mergers in 2002, Mr. Monti instituted sweeping changes -- recruiting a chief economist to analyze mergers from a business perspective, and appointing ''devil's advocates'' to cross-examine his staff's conclusions.
 Mr. Monti's new-found caution was evident in the Microsoft case, which stretched over five years.
 ''He reacted well to his three defeats,'' Mr. Kolasky said. ''Hiring an economist, and giving him staff, has made the analysis more sophisticated. Merger reform is moving in the right direction.''
 Despite his reputation for confrontation, Mr. Monti adopted a penitent tone after the legal reversals, promising to learn from them. Some experts said the strategy probably saved his reputation.
 ''He handled it beautifully by being conciliatory,'' said Robert Pitofsky, a former chairman of the F.T.C. ''It's a rare person that can see the disadvantages of being resentful and thin-skinned.''

HEADLINE: China's Central Bank Raises Rate for Banks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 24 

 BODY:
China's central bank announced late Wednesday that it would raise the interest rates it charges banks for loans by nearly two-thirds of a percentage point, and would require the weakest banks to hold larger reserves.
 Taken together, the two measures represent a moderate tightening of monetary policy -- a light tap on the brakes for an economy that is showing signs of overheating and rising inflation. Economists said the two moves could somewhat slow the swift increase in bank lending that has caused a steep rise in China's money supply and has raised fears that Chinese banks may be creating another wave of bad loans.
 The two steps show Beijing's growing determination to prevent banks from taking undue risks in lending in the confidence that the government will bail them out if they run into trouble. The central bank's moves will increase pressure on commercial banks to shore up their finances so as to avoid extra costs in borrowing money and in holding greater reserves. 
 The central bank also said that the State Council, China's cabinet, had given it greater flexibility in setting the interest rates that it charges to banks. Until now, the State Council had to approve every change in interest rates, a cumbersome rule that limited the central bank's ability to move rates up and down in response to the changing fortunes of the economy.
 The new policy will ''slowly, step by step, enhance the ability of the central bank to guide interest rates in the market,'' the central bank, known as the People's Bank of China, said in a statement.
 The interest rates that China is raising are most nearly comparable to the Federal Reserve's discount rate in the United States. But whereas the Fed strongly discourages banks from borrowing from it at this rate except as a last resort, China's central bank is a significant lender to smaller banks that lack strong branch networks for gathering deposits and have trouble persuading bigger banks that they are creditworthy enough to qualify for interbank loans, experts on China's banking system said.
 Having the central bank charge higher interest rates to banks shows that China is moving toward more sophisticated methods of economic management than simply raising reserve requirements for the entire banking industry, as it did last September, said Liang Hong, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Goldman Sachs.
 Interbank lending in China is less organized than in the United States, while bond trading in China is still in its infancy. So the effect of Wednesday's moves on interest rates for interbank loans and for bonds is hard to predict, economists said.
 The People's Bank of China closely regulates the interest rates that banks may charge companies and consumers, and said on Wednesday that it was not allowing any increase in these rates.
 Many business executives and economists across Asia have taken to watching with great attention whether China's central bank can engineer a soft landing of the Chinese economy, by gently restraining what even Chinese officials are describing as the tendency of many sectors of the economy to overheat.
 David Burton, the director of the Asia and Pacific department of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech here on Tuesday that the international agency was optimistic that China could manage its economy successfully, while the fund remained on the watch for potential risks.
 ''Our central scenario is for a soft landing, but a more abrupt slowdown remains a possibility if China is not successful in striking the right balance between preventing generalized overheating and avoiding a large decline in investment,'' he said.
 The central bank's actions come as shortages of critical commodities and increasingly severe transportation bottlenecks are starting to push up inflation in China. Several hours before the central bank acted, China's National Bureau of Statistics announced that wholesale prices of industrial goods were 3.5 percent higher in February than a year earlier.
 That is the same pace of inflation at the wholesale level as in January, and represents a sharp acceleration from most of last year, when inflation was practically nonexistent. Chinese authorities were concerned about the possibility of deflation early last year.
 The People's Bank of China said late Wednesday that on Thursday it would raise by 63-hundredths of a percentage point the interest rate it charges to banks for loans without collateral for maturities of up to one year. The rate for a 20-day loan, for example, would rise to 3.33 percent from 2.7 percent.
 The central bank said that it would also raise the interest rate it charges for rediscounting -- essentially, overnight lending with the bank putting up collateral -- to 3.24 percent from 2.97 percent.
 Banks are currently charging each other interest rates of around 2 percent for short-term loans. But banks have become leery of lending anything to many small banks, often owned by municipal governments, that are in especially bad financial condition.
 These small banks have increasingly been turning to the central bank for loans, especially as rates in the interbank lending market have been creeping up because of inflation fears. So, until now, the cost of borrowing from the central bank has seemed quite manageable for small banks, said Joan Zheng, an economist in the Hong Kong office of J.P. Morgan.
 The central bank said in a separate announcement that the weakest banks, as measured by four criteria assessing capital adequacy, would be required to hold 7.5 percent of their assets as reserves at the central bank, beginning on April 25. The current requirement is that banks hold 7 percent of their assets as reserves.
 Because the central bank pays negligible interest on reserves, the increase to 7.5 percent acts as a financial penalty on weaker banks and an incentive to operate more prudently.
 The central bank has set lower reserve requirements for rural financial institutions, and it said on Wednesday that it would increase the interest rates that it charged them for loans by only half as much as it is charging the rest of the country's financial institutions. Beijing is trying to improve economic growth in rural areas, which have fallen behind cities badly in income growth over the last decade.
 The four biggest banks in China have large portfolios of nonperforming loans, and have required three huge bailouts in the last decade. But they could benefit from Wednesday's changes by the central bank, which has historically looked out for their interests and exempted them from the increase in reserve requirements for weak capital bases.
 The entirely state-owned big four banks -- the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China, the China Construction Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China -- take in a huge and steadily rising flow of deposits from China's increasingly affluent people, and lend part of these deposits to other, less liquid banks. The smaller banks may be forced now to borrow from the big four instead of the central bank.
 A monetary policy report released by the People's Bank of China on March 17 showed that the big four banks were net lenders of $110 billion in the interbank market last year, while a few other medium-size banks were net lenders of another $10.8 billion.
 Foreign financial institutions, which face severe restrictions on their ability to take deposits in China but are stepping up their lending, borrowed $5.2 billion last year. Domestic financial institutions, including securities firms as well as smaller banks, borrowed the rest.

HEADLINE: Cheney to Visit Japan, China and South Korea in April

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney plans to visit China, Japan and South Korea next month to discuss North Korea's nuclear arms program, operations in Iraq and trade policy, Bush administration officials said Wednesday. It will be only his third overseas trip since taking office three years ago.
 The weeklong trip, which the White House has not yet formally announced, was originally scheduled for last spring, but had to be postponed in light of the crisis in Iraq. It would also have coincided with the outbreak of SARS in Asia last year. 
 Traveling to Asia in mid-April would allow Mr. Cheney to demonstrate his foreign policy expertise at a time when he is also assuming an increasingly visible role in the nascent presidential campaign.
 ''The fact he's making this trip in an election year signals the importance the administration puts on alliance maintenance, North Korea and U.S.-China relations,'' said a senior Republican Congressional aide. ''It's an important region with lots going on, and it can't afford to wait until after the election.''
 The trip, timed to coincide with the Senate's spring recess when Mr. Cheney will not have to worry about having to break a tie vote, would also serve to showcase what administration officials consider two of their most important first-term, foreign policy achievements.
 After relations with China got off to a rocky start when a Navy EP-3E surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet on April 1, 2001, and was forced to land, the White House now sees its relationship with Beijing as a major accomplishment.
 Administration officials say they are pleased to see China play a leading role in the North Korean talks, are satisfied that China played a responsible role during the United Nations debate over Iraq and recognize that China plays an increasingly important role economically.
 Administration officials noted that China -- as well as Japan, South Korea and Russia -- has been engaged in the talks to resolve the North Korea crisis. They offered this as evidence that the administration is not unilateralist, as critics contend, but instead has a more nuanced strategy of involving regional partners in resolving thorny issues.
 The North Korean nuclear arms program is expected to top the agenda in each of the three countries Mr. Cheney visits, officials said. He is to visit Japan first, then China and then South Korea, a senior administration official said.
 ''He'll talk about North Korea, that's for sure,'' said Scott Snyder, a senior associate for international relations at the Asia Foundation in Washington.
 The administration is insisting that North Korea agree first to dismantle its nuclear programs before Washington bestows any benefits, from security guarantees to economic and energy assistance. Specifically, the Americans are demanding a ''complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement'' of the North's nuclear programs.
 Mr. Cheney and other in the administration are skeptical that the talks, which may not resume until April or May, will yield a commitment from the North to dismantle its weapons without ratcheting up pressure on the North, according to specialists in Asia policy.
 Kevin Kellems, a Cheney spokesman, declined to discuss details of the trip. But other government officials, independent Asia experts and industry officials said Mr. Cheney's agenda would be wide ranging.
 In China, these officials say, he is also likely to discuss the Chinese military's modernization plans, the $113 billion trade gap with China, the implications of Chen Shui-bian's apparent re-election in Taiwan, and Beijing's threats toward democracy advocates in Hong Kong.
 Some nuclear energy industry officials expressed hopes that Mr. Cheney might also lobby Chinese officials to buy American-made Westinghouse nuclear power plants at $2 billion apiece. The United States is competing with France, Russia and Canada to build four 1,000-megawatt plants in China as part of its major expansion as a nuclear-energy provider.
 President Bush promoted American nuclear technology to the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, in a meeting in Washington in December. But a senior administration official said late Wednesday that Mr. Cheney was not aware of the issue and, as of now, did not plan to raise it on his visit.
 The administration is interested in encouraging China's nuclear power sector as a way of curbing China's reliance on coal, much of it very impure, which contributes to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, a senior United States energy official said.
 In Japan, Mr. Cheney is expected to meet with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to thank Japan for dispatching troops to Iraq for aid and reconstruction assistance, and to seek support for an administration proposal to promote democratic reforms and economic changes in the Middle East.
 In South Korea, Mr. Cheney is also expected to thank the government for its commitment of 500 troops to Iraq, and discuss the size and location of American troops over the long term in the South, an issue now under review at the Pentagon.

HEADLINE: Saudis Aiding U.S. in Cutting Off Terrorism Funds, Panel Is Told

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24 

 BODY:
A panel of government terrorism experts testified Wednesday that a deadly attack last year in the Saudi capital of Riyadh had spurred the Saudi government to work more closely with the United States in stemming the flow of money to terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and Hamas.
 At the same time, the panel pointed to the closed nature of Saudi society and banking institutions to say that more efforts were needed to stop money from reaching groups that consider themselves at war with the United States, Israel and their allies.
 ''Their performance has not been flawless, and they have a large task before them,'' J. Cofer Black, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, said of the Saudi government as he appeared before a House subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia. ''But we see clear evidence of the seriousness of purpose and the commitment of the leadership of the kingdom to this fight.'' 
 Mr. Black was joined by two other experts, Thomas J. Harrington, a deputy assistant director of the F.B.I., and Juan Carlos Zarate, a deputy assistant Treasury secretary. Together, they described recent joint efforts between the United States and Saudi Arabia that have closed down charities suspected of funneling money to terrorists and spurred Saudi banks to freeze the assets of organizations suspected of financing terrorist operations.
 They said some of the new initiatives would have been unimaginable before last May 12, when a series of bombs rocked the Saudi capital, killing 29 people, including nine Americans. Mr. Harrington said, ''The current state of cooperation between our two countries is significant, and information sharing continues to increase in matters pertaining to groups like Al Qaeda.''
 No one from the Saudi government appeared before the subcommittee. But just as lawmakers ended their questions, two brochures from the Saudi Embassy, each recounting the country's antiterrorism efforts, were distributed to reporters.
 The assessment by the experts went largely unchallenged by lawmakers. Only Representative Shelley Berkley, a Democrat from Nevada, expressed skepticism toward Saudi Arabia's professed eagerness to fight terrorism, saying, ''I'm not overly impressed'' with the efforts.
 ''They have been exporting terrorism for 20 years,'' she said. ''Now that they are victims, all of a sudden they are our allies. To me, it's too little too late. We don't have a clue what the Saudis are doing or whom the royal family is funding.''
 To some degree, her view was echoed by two other witnesses, Steven Simon, an analyst for the Rand Corporation, and Robert Baer, a former Central Intelligence Agency agent. Mr. Simon described a country where Osama bin Laden, a Saudi native and the leader of Al Qaeda, ''is revered'' and supporters would always find a way to get him and others the financial support they need to plan future attacks.
 ''You can build a dam, but tributaries develop,'' Mr. Simon said of efforts to choke off money.
 Mr. Baer, who served in Iraq, Lebanon and other Middle East countries, said Saudi Arabia's efforts to dismantle terrorist organizations would always be hampered by the passion of terrorist groups and the financial traditions of a region that relies heavily on cash transfers.
 ''Going after banking and charities is a good start,'' he said. ''But it's just the tip of the iceberg. This is going to be a long war.''

HEADLINE: Passport Deadline Extension Is Sought

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge are warning that a deadline that requires 27 industrialized countries to issue their citizens computer-coded passports to travel to the United States could threaten the American travel industry.
 The countries -- 22 European nations, Australia, Brunei, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore -- have to begin providing passports with technology that recognizes travelers' faces by Oct. 26. Congress imposed the deadline after the 2001 attacks.
 The State Department says nearly all the countries are expected to miss the deadline, forcing millions of visitors with old-fashioned passports to apply for visas for the United States. 
 In a letter to Congress last week, Mr. Powell and Mr. Ridge said the tourists, who do not usually need visas to travel to the United States, might visit elsewhere, and they urged lawmakers to extend the deadline to Oct. 26, 2006. Failing to do so, the officials said, would result in ''grave consequences.''
 ''It is important to note that the U.S. economy would likely suffer gravely if tourists 'vote with their feet' and go elsewhere, possibly resulting in multibillion-dollar losses to our economy and reducing employment in one of our economy's most dynamic sectors,'' the secretaries wrote to Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
 Mr. Sensenbrenner has asked Mr. Ridge and Mr. Powell to testify on the question next month. In the meantime, he has written to ambassadors of the affected countries to determine which nations will likely miss the deadline. 
 ''Right now, we're in the information-gathering stage,'' Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for Mr. Sensenbrenner, said.
 The request to delay the deadline highlights the challenges for the Bush administration as it tries to enforce new measures to screen foreigners. In September, the State Department extended for a year the deadline for machine-readable passports from the 27 countries. Officials are still scrambling to meet a Congressional deadline of Dec. 31, 2004, to fingerprint and photograph travelers at the 50 busiest land ports of entry.
 This month, domestic security officials announced that Mexicans with border cards, who make up the bulk of foreigners at land crossings, would probably be exempt from the security system.
 Some members of Congress, including Representative John F. Tierney, Democrat of Massachusetts, have expressed the concern that exempting Mexicans and extending the deadline for foreigners who lack facial-recognition passports would create ''gaping holes'' in security.
 Administration officials and travel industry executives disagree. Industry representatives have been lobbying to delay the deadline because visitors from the affected countries are so important to the tourism market. About 12 million of the 19 million overseas visitors who traveled to the United States in 2002 came from the 27 countries whose citizens can visit for 90 days without visas. Tourists from Britain, France, Germany and Japan alone spent $22.2 billion in the United States in 2002, accounting for a third of spending by overseas visitors, according to the Travel Industry Association of America.
 Failing to extend the deadline would also create problems for American officials overseas. The State Department says the demand for tourist visas would probably surge to 12 million in the 2005 fiscal year from 7 million in 2003, creating a workload that would most likely swamp consular staffs and create significant backlogs in issuing visas.
 At a Congressional hearing this month, the assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, Maura Harty, called the anticipated demand for tourist visas ''a frightening prospect.''
 ''Extension of the deadline is the only option,'' said Rick Webster, director of government affairs for the Travel Industry Association of America, which represents the largest airlines, hotels, cruise lines and car rental companies.
 In their letter, Mr. Powell and Mr. Ridge said none of the 27 countries could issue the new passports ''in sufficient numbers to meet the legitimate needs of their traveling nationals'' by October. They emphasized that the delays resulted from technical problems, not lack of effort.
 ''It is not because of the lack of will, but rather due to interoperability issues, privacy issues, chip-durability concerns and procurement delays,'' they wrote. ''Clearly, we need to address this problem.''

HEADLINE: Missed Chances In a Long Hunt For bin Laden

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON and TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24 

 BODY:
In 1996, the C.I.A. secretly created a special operational unit devoted to tracking a single man, a Saudi-born exile named Osama bin Laden, then living in Sudan and considered a major terrorist financier. By early 1997, the office, known as the bin Laden station, had concluded that he was also a terrorist organizer, based in Afghanistan, with a military committee planning operations against American interests worldwide.
 ''Although this information was disseminated in many reports, the unit's sense of alarm about bin Laden was not widely shared or understood within the intelligence and policy communities,'' the commission investigating the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, reported on Wednesday. ''Employees in the unit told us they felt their zeal attracted ridicule from their peers.''
 What happened over the nearly five years from that moment until the devastating attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon is the story of bureaucratic miscommunication, diplomatic dead ends, military hesitation, intelligence failures, political rivalries and policy miscalculations at the highest levels of two presidential administrations -- a trail of fumbles presented in sweeping new detail in two days of commission hearings and four staff reports made public this week. 
 The commission's work provides the government's first comprehensive account of how the Clinton and Bush administrations assessed and responded to the growing threat presented by the bin Laden network before Sept. 11. Previous government accounts, and testimony by national security officials, focused more narrowly on specific failings of intelligence and law-enforcement agencies.
 In the last years of Bill Clinton's administration, the commission's findings show, there were deep misunderstandings between White House officials, who believed the president had clearly authorized actions that would kill Mr. bin Laden, and C.I.A. officers who thought that they were only permitted to kill him in a capture attempt. There were a half-dozen frustrating efforts to use Afghan proxies to attack Mr. bin Laden, and a series of successively more ambitious plans for military strikes that proved unworkable, diplomatic pressure that failed and bitter disputes about how best to use unmanned Predator drone aircraft to gather intelligence.
 In the first months of the Bush administration, the commission found, there was sharp skepticism about the Clinton approach -- a conviction that it had ''run out of gas,'' as Stephen Hadley, the Bush deputy national security adviser, put it. 
 There was also hesitation about how and whether to retaliate for the October 2000 attack on the Navy destroyer Cole, more debate among the White House, Pentagon and C.I.A. over arming the Predators with missiles, and repeated delays that kept a new policy for expanded action against Al Qaeda from being approved until Sept. 4, 2001 -- just a week before the attacks.
 As intercepts of reported threats against unspecified targets jumped alarmingly in June and July, 2001, the deputy director of central intelligence, John McLaughlin, told the commission he ''felt a great tension'' between ''the new administration's need to understand these issues and his sense that this was a matter of great urgency.'' 
 He also reported frustration that some policy makers in the new administration ''who had not lived through such threat surges before, questioned the validity of the intelligence or wondered if it was disinformation, though they were persuaded when they probed it.''
 In all the pages of commission reports, and in all the hours of testimony, one haunting reality becomes clear: Whatever the missteps of the government in the months and years before the attacks, there was always a lonely chorus of experts, mostly at lower levels of the intelligence community, warning that the worst could really happen, even if they did not know how, where or when.
 As early as mid-1997, the commission found, one C.I.A. officer recognized that the intelligence community alone could not solve the problem of Mr. bin Laden. ''All we're doing is holding the ring until the cavalry gets here,'' he warned his supervisor in a memorandum. 
 There were some successes: Foiled plots, economic sanctions and a freeze on the Taliban's assets. But through both administrations, and despite internal pressure from critics scattered around the bureaucracy, the efforts against Al Qaeda were more notable for their limits than for their reach.
 ''If officers at all levels questioned the effectiveness of the most active strategy the policy makers were employing to defeat the terrorist enemy,'' the commission's staff concluded, ''the commission needs to ask why that strategy remained largely unchanged throughout the period leading up to 9/11.''
 What follows is an examination of how this happened, based on the commission's staff reports and testimony from current and former officials.

Early Clinton Efforts
 In June 1995, President Clinton signed a new policy redefining terrorism ''as a potential threat to national security as well as a criminal act,'' and committing the United States to ''apply all appropriate means to combat it.'' 
 But despite an escalating pattern of threats and attacks, the Clinton administration remained constrained by a parallel series of interlocking diplomatic and military considerations from dealing as aggressively as it might have liked with Al Qaeda, according to the commission reports
 At first, the C.I.A. regarded Mr. bin Laden's move from Sudan to Afghanistan in 1996 as a break. The agency had long experience dealing with tribal leaders since its officers ran an arms pipeline that supplied millions of dollars in arms used successfully against the Soviet invaders who in 1989 were pushed out of Afghanistan in a humiliating defeat.
 By 1998, the C.I.A.'s special bin Laden unit had a plan: The agency suggested using Afghan tribal fighters to assault a terror compound where Mr. bin Laden was believed to be living with the assent of the Taliban government. He would be captured and transported to the United States. But like so many of its covert action plans, the bin Laden unit's proposal collapsed after months of discussion. The risk of failure was deemed to be too high and C.I.A. officials doubted the ability of their proxy forces.
 The capture plan was just one of about a half dozen instances before the Sept. 11 attacks when the C.I.A.'s informants in Afghanistan provided enough information to consider attacking Mr. bin Laden. But each time, the operation was aborted. If intelligence was limited, so was diplomacy. In 1998, Mr. bin Laden issued a public call for any Muslim to kill any American, military or civilian, anywhere in the world. In April of that year Bill Richardson, then Mr. Clinton's representative to the United Nations, became the highest-ranking American to visit Afghanistan in decades and asked the Taliban government to surrender Mr. bin Laden to the United States. 
 In May, Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia agreed to make a secret effort to persuade the Taliban to expel Mr. bin Laden to the United States or another country. But these efforts ultimately came to naught, as did diplomatic pressure on two successive governments in neighboring Pakistan, including a one-day visit by Mr. Clinton in 2000. ''The Pakistani position was that it had to support the Taliban, and that the only way forward was to engage them and try to moderate their behavior,'' the commission staff found.
 On Aug. 7, 1998, the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were attacked, and intelligence quickly pinned the blame on Mr. bin Laden. On Aug. 20, days after Mr. Clinton acknowledged lying about his affair with an intern, the president ordered cruise missile strikes, code-named Operation Infinite Reach, against a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and a suspected chemical weapons plant in the Sudan. The missiles hit their intended targets, but neither Mr. bin Laden nor any other terrorist leaders were killed.
 Still, the administration considered follow-up strikes, and its counterterrorism coordinator, Richard A. Clarke, drafted a paper for a political-military plan he called ''Delenda,'' from the Latin ''to destroy,'' envisioning a continuing campaign of regular, small strikes, whenever targets could be found. No senior officials agreed with him. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen argued that the terrorist camps were crude, and that further efforts to hit them without killing Mr. bin Laden would only make Washington look weak.
 But there were other advocates of more aggressive action. Counterterrorism officials in the Defense Department, unaware of Mr. Clarke's plan, warned that while the terrorist threat had grown, ''we have not fundamentally altered our philosophy or our approach'' and that in the event of new horrific attacks, ''we will have no choice, nor, unfortunately, will we have a plan.'' The paper wound up in office of an under secretary of defense, where no action was taken.
 So cruise missile strikes became the ''default option,'' the commission found, and were considered on at least four occasions -- in December 1998 and February and May 1999. But they were always ruled out, apparently because of uneasiness about the accuracy of the intelligence, including concerns in one case that a strike might inadvertently kill members of the royal family of the United Arab Emirates at an Afghan hunting camp. After July 1999, there was no occasion when cruise missiles were readied for a possible strike.

Debates on a New Approach
 By the late 1990's, morale in the bin Laden unit sagged, the commission reported. In June 1999, Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, said that covert efforts against Mr. bin Laden had failed.
 In response, the C.I.A. installed new leaders at the agency's counterterrorism center and at the bin Laden unit. They proposed shifting away from a reliance on Afghan tribal leaders to creating the C.I.A.'s own sources. Another proposal, initially resisted by some senior officials, involved using unmanned Predator aircraft to fly over Afghanistan relaying video footage back to the agency.
 The flights eventually began, and twice, the Predator's cameras recorded what appeared to be a security detail clustered around a tall man in a white robe who some analysts concluded was Mr. bin Laden. 
 Mr. Clinton's national security advisers told the commission that Mr. Clinton wanted Mr. bin Laden dead and legal advisers said that under the law, the killing of someone who posed an imminent threat to the country was an act of self-defense, not assassination.
 But the commission reported that every C.I.A. official interviewed on the subject, including George J. Tenet, the director, said that they believed Mr. bin Laden could only be lawfully killed in one circumstance: if he died in an operation intended to capture him.
 ''Working-level C.I.A. officers said they were frustrated by what they saw as the policy constraints of having to instruct their assets to mount a capture operation,'' one commission report said, referring at one point to Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the Northern Alliance opposition in Afghanistan who was assassinated just days before the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 ''When Northern Alliance leader Massoud was briefed on the carefully worded instructions for him, the briefer recalls that Massoud laughed and said: ''You Americans are crazy. You guys never change.''
 On Oct. 12, 2000, suicide bombers in an explosive-filled skiff bombed the destroyer Cole at anchor in Yemen, and while evidence emerged that individuals linked to Al Qaeda had been responsible, clear evidence linking the attack to Mr. bin Laden himself was not forthcoming.
 No decision on a possible retaliation had been reached by the time the Clinton administration left office. Mr. Berger told his successor, Condoleezza Rice, that ''she would be spending more time on terrorism and Al Qaeda than any other issue.'' 

The Bush Administration
 Mr. Berger was far from alone. In one previously undisclosed intelligence briefing after the election but before Mr. Bush took office, James L. Pavitt, a senior C.I.A. official, warned the new administration that Al Qaeda was ''one of the gravest threats to the country.''
 For his part, Mr. Clarke, who was kept on as White House counterterrorism adviser, briefed Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and others, warning that Al Qaeda had sleeper cells in many countries, including the United States.
 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told the commission that he was consumed by other military matters and ''did not recall any particular terrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11 other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system for possible use against bin Laden.''
 Although the Bush team took office only three months after the terrorist attack on the Cole, Mr. Bush's aides showed no more interest than their predecessors in the Clinton administration in launching a reprisal strike against Al Qaeda. Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, said that by the time the Bush administration was in place, the Cole attack had grown ''stale,'' according to the commission.
 Instead of action and new initiatives, the Bush administration engaged in a lengthy policy debate. Mr. Bush's aides rejected most of the Clinton administration's ideas and plans as ineffectual or too narrow.
 But evidence compiled by the commission suggests that before Sept. 11, the Bush team failed to put into place a comprehensive game plan of its own against the bin Laden network.
 In March 2001, one commission report made public on Wednesday disclosed, Ms. Rice asked Mr. Tenet to prepare a new set of legal authorities that would expand the agency's powers to carry out covert actions in Afghanistan. Mr. Tenet complied, but told Mr. Hadley, Ms. Rice's deputy, that changes in authority usually emerged from a policy review.
 In May, Ms. Rice recalled that Mr. Bush expressed frustration as Mr. Tenet repeatedly warned of terror threats in his daily briefings. At one point, the President expressed impatience with ''swatting flies,'' and urged his advisers to greater efforts against Al Qaeda.
 But Mr. Bush's aides were engaged in a lengthy examination of the government's approach toward Al Qaeda and Afghanistan -- a review that went on unresolved through the spring and summer of 2001. By June, a draft of a presidential directive authorizing an ambitious covert action plan was circulating through the upper echelons of the administration -- with no decision.
 Some intelligence officials expressed frustration over what they viewed as the Bush administration's slow pace and its apparent unwillingness to grasp what they viewed as the extreme gravity of the threat. Two C.I.A. counterterrorism officers, who were not identified, told the commission that they were ''so worried about an impending disaster'' that they considered resigning in protest, a report said.
 By midsummer 2001, the danger signs were growing. A commission report said that by late July, intelligence agencies were deluged with the ''greatest volume'' of reports hinting that ''multiple, possibly catastrophic, terrorist attacks were being planned against American interests.'' They seemed to point to attacks outside the United States.
 The C.I.A's counterterrorism center identified 30 possible attack sites abroad and began efforts to disrupt possible attacks -- even as Mohamed Atta and the last of the Sept. 11 hijackers had safely arrived in the United States, all of them carrying visas issued by the State Department.
 By August, the spike in threat reporting had subsided. Mr. Tenet said that the C.I.A. had concluded that whatever terrorist activity had been planned had been delayed. At the same time, a commission report said, a cabinet-level national security committee on Sept. 4 reached agreement on a new policy toward Afghanistan.
 On Sept. 10, Mr. Tenet was formally advised to prepare a fresh set of authorizations to put into effect the new covert action plan that included operations to disrupt Mr. bin Laden's control of Al Qaeda -- a plan that was expected to take at least three years.

HEADLINE: A Song of the Loom Is Silenced

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE

 BODY:
THE century-old Jacquard looms lining the factory floor of Scalamandre in Long Island City, Queens, offer as pure an evocation of industrial-era romance as did the Twentieth Century Limited. But instead of coal and billowing steam, the clattering looms do their work with nimble fingers, taut ropes, cast-iron flywheels and a harplike scrim of lustrous threads.
 These old looms, tended by artisans with enough agility to retie a single broken thread plucked from thousands, helped Scalamandre become a premier supplier of draperies for the White House and even $50-a-yard patio upholstery. Elsewhere in the mill, workers fashioned handmade tassels and silk-screened wallpaper.
 Over the last 10 years, while thousands of textile jobs were drawn by cheap labor to the Far East, Scalamandre's looms in Long Island City kept on working, employing, most recently, 90 people. But last month, 75 years after its founding, Scalamandre announced it had sold the old red brick mill with the big green doors on 24th Street to Time Equities, a real estate developer in Manhattan, and was moving most of its production to a fully computerized factory in South Carolina. 
 ''It's the only way we can preserve our textile legacy and also sell fabrics that are made in America by Americans,'' said Mark J. Bitter, the chief executive and a grandson of the company founder, Franco Scalamandre.
 And so the old looms and the steady thwack of silk weft threads being beaten back by wood battens -- a sound so sonorous that Adriana Bitter, Mr. Bitter's 70-year-old mother, wrote a poem about it when she was a child -- will soon be silenced. Of 20 textile looms, 6 have already been delivered to the old Bethlehem Steel mill in Bethlehem, Pa., the future site of the National Museum of Industrial History, affiliated with the Smithsonian; one will be buffed up and put on display in the lobby of the new mill; almost all of the rest will be scrapped for parts.
 Mr. Bitter said that about 50 workers would be laid off with severance packages; others would relocate to South Carolina. Although a handful of workers will remain in rented space at the Long Island City mill making wall coverings, hand-painted fabrics and passementerie (tassels and trimming), some of it on hand looms powered with foot pedals, shutting down the big looms marks the end of an illustrious era.
 ''Since the onset of inexpensive imports from the Far East, the textile industry in America has been under siege,'' said Mr. Bitter, 45, who swept the factory floors as a child. ''How can I compete with a guy in China?'' In Europe, weaving is subsidized by governments and recognized as part of a nation's patrimony, but broadly speaking, ''it's too late for textiles in this country,'' he said.
 The Jacquard looms in the Scalamandre mill, though fully mechanized, made only 2 to 20 yards a day, depending on the complexity of the fabric, and still needed a lot of personal attention. Computerized looms, by comparison, will make 20 to 100 yards a day. The newer machines will each, on average, do the work of six iron-and-wood looms, minus the balletic grace. 
 Luddites, however, will be sorry to hear that according to Mr. Bitter's mother, nothing will be lost in the translation. The computerized looms produce, if anything, more perfect textiles. In fact, Mrs. Bitter said by telephone from Florida, where she lives six months of the year with her husband, Edwin W. Bitter, older textiles had more imperfections. ''When we do reproduction work, we should really be adding in some more mistakes,'' she said.
 Economies are rarely a factor where luxury products are concerned, and a Tuscan Vine Scalamandre silk lampas, at $1,000 a yard, is a top-of-the-line luxury. Still, for many people who grew up in the 20th century, there is something appealing about a centuries-old craft -- weaving -- maintaining its artisanal integrity in modern times. A visitor to the mill glimpses utility, decoration and durability meshing lyrically in Victorian-era machinery.
 At Scalamandre, the cast-iron wheels that turn the pins around which the fabric is wound come from the same mind-set that produced garlanded cast-iron handrails. In another corner stands a device for twisting cords that was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, and never improved upon. Cardboard Jacquard cards, each punched with holes to determine the ornate patterns in the weave, are kept on long strings looped over the looms. A complex pattern might require as many as 20,000 cards. Developed by J. M. Jacquard, a Frenchman, in the 18th century, these cards are the precursors of computer punch cards. 
 They are charming but outmoded. The industry has been fading over the years like colors being leached out of a tapestry left in direct sunlight. Crompton & Knowles, the Massachusetts company that used to make Scalamandre's looms, divested itself of its loom-making business in 1981. (Crompton & Knowles became the Crompton Corporation, a specialty chemicals company based in Middlebury, Conn.) Scalamandre eventually had to make its own looms from salvaged parts. 
 Even the language of ornate textiles and trim -- the gimp, galloon and lampas -- has grown so rarefied that perhaps only Scrabble champs can define the words.
 According to Mrs. Bitter, it takes 6 to 10 years to train an expert weaver, who can earn up to $17 an hour, said Luis Ginorio, a representative of Unite, the union at the mill; the average worker, he said, might make $10 to $11 an hour. In South Carolina, he added, the average wage might be $7 or $8 an hour. For many years, the trimming department, where the ornate silk tape (a galloon) and drapery trim and upholstery edging (gimp) was made, has been the weaver's equivalent of Mount Everest. ''It took us a very long time to convince the elderly males to agree to train women on the trimming looms,'' Mrs. Bitter said. ''Like so many other things, it was considered a man's world.''
 Today, mostly middle-aged and elderly women wearing floral hausfrau jackets over stretch pants work in the trim department. But it is still considered the ultimate weaving work; recently a woman proudly wore a white silk tassel as a corsage.
 AS if ripped from the pages of an E. L. Doctorow novel, the Scalamandre story begins on a dusty road on the eve of the Depression. Franco Scalamandre, disgusted with the rise of Fascism in Italy, emigrated in 1923 from Caserta, the heart of the Italian silk industry, and eventually settled in Paterson, N.J., home of America's textile works. As his daughter tells it, he saw a truckload of looms headed for the dump, and offered the driver $10 for the lot, whereupon the truck's passenger jumped down and said: ''You can't take them without me. I'm the weaver.''
 In 1929, Scalamandre took 10 looms to Long Island City with the intention of making Renaissance-style textiles of European-grade quality. The work quickly came to the attention of the duPont family and William Randolph Hearst, who was decorating his California castle, San Simeon. Mrs. Bitter recalled how as a young girl she created the cupid pattern for the entrance hall wallpaper at San Simeon. 
 Scalamandre works can today be found in mansions in Newport, R.I., in Vizcaya in Miami and in the Iolani Palace in Honolulu. The velvet curtain for the Metropolitan Opera House was made by Scalamandre; so was the fringe on Big Bird's scrawny legs in ''Sesame Street.'' Starting with the Hoover administration, Scalamandre has donated fabrics to every White House. Franco Scalamandre was hurt when Jacqueline Kennedy did not make public that Scalamandre had donated its finest French silk lampas fabric to her ambitious refurbishing of the Red Room in the 1960's. (She was cautious because she had been lambasted by the press for extravagance.)
 The $300-a-yard Newport damask curtains that hung in Bill Clinton's Oval Office came from Scalamandre, although a competitor's curtains are hanging during the Bush administration, albeit with Scalamandre trim. ''But we'll get them back,'' Mr. Bitter said, expecting to have his curtains hanging once again. 
 Historic reproductions have remained a labor of love for the company and a tradition that Robert F. Bitter, Mark Bitter's older brother, who presides over the design of new work as well as re-creations, expects to continue in the studio at the Queens mill, at least for now. Modern technology has made it possible for the design work and production to take place in two different places, said Mr. Bitter, 47. ''I went along with the move and separating from the mill, which is in our lives and in our blood, because I was promised that our capacity would improve. And, holding on to the edge of my seat as I say it, I have to believe that it will.''
 Time rolls on whether the wheels are cast iron or plastic. Scalamandre's work for hotels, institutions and luxury homes will be done from now on on high-tech looms; some 200 more people will be hired in South Carolina. Still, there's little comparison between wood knitting needles fanning out eight yards wide like some petrified sea urchin, as they do on the old warping machine, and its computerized equivalent made of aluminum and shrouded in a green plastic hood.
 And as the showboat era of textile machinery comes to a close, Scalamandre is poised to go full steam ahead. Still, while the old Jacquard looms head for the scrap pile, Mark Bitter is keeping a few in mothballs, just in case. ''You never know -- we might someday get an order that we just couldn't do any other way,'' he said.
 He sounded somewhat hopeful.

HEADLINE: Packing Comfort Into a Pod

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
WHEN Andrea Burns and Peter Flynn were expecting their first child last year, they considered a two-bedroom Midtown apartment that a relative was giving up and looked in their Greenwich Village neighborhood, where they wanted to stay. Their choices seemed to come down to a fifth-floor walkup in a neighborhood they did not like (with no washing machine in the basement) or apartments for at least twice their rent of under $1,000 a month. 
 So they stayed put -- in their rent-stabilized, 265-square-foot studio. ''Everything we gained in space we lost in almost everything else,'' Mr. Flynn said.
 Now, the couple and their infant son, Hudson, have made the tiny studio seem cozy rather than cramped. Along the windows, they have set up a nursery for Hudson, with a soft blond bassinet, dresser, rocking chair and toy chest. The couple sleep in a Murphy bed that fits into a mirrored cupboard. And they have room for a couch, a fold-out desk and a large wardrobe for clothes and linens. 
 The high price of real estate has always trapped New York families in tiny spaces. But with the average sales price of a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan hitting a record high of $1.14 million in the last three months of 2003, a new generation is feeling the pinch as the vise tightens on middle-class families wishing for that extra bedroom. Given bidding wars and low inventories, ''this is as bad as I've seen it,'' said Ron Lense, a Douglas Elliman broker, who has witnessed real estate cycles for 17 years. 
 In some cases, couples are buying apartments they know are too small, believing that with interest rates low, it is better to invest now than to rent. 
 When Amy Shore and her husband, Philip Heimes, were trying to buy an apartment early last year, they hoped to find one to accommodate the baby they were expecting. But on their budget of less than $300,000, the two-bedroom apartments they found either required thousands of dollars of work or were in neighborhoods that would have meant long commutes.
 So they bought a 585-square-foot one-bedroom condo near Columbia University for $245,000. After their daughter, Maya, was born last July, they all slept in the bedroom. When Maya turned 6 months this year, the couple bought a Murphy bed and moved into the living room, leaving her to sleep in a crib in the bedroom.
 ''We thought originally we would be here for three years, tops,'' Ms. Shore said one morning this week as she watched Maya sleeping peacefully in her crib in a nursery with pale blue walls. ''But now we don't feel that way anymore. You realize you don't need as much space as you think you need for the child.''
 Because the couple bought when interest rates were down, and the value of their apartment has risen about 22 percent in the year they have owned it, they could use their equity to move to a larger apartment in a few years.
 Gene Vezzani, a broker with Douglas Elliman who sold the apartment to Ms. Shore and Mr. Heimes, said, ''I think that a lot of people understand, with the interest rates so low, that they're jumping in now, knowing that if they don't, the market may well move away from them.''
 When Roger Miller and Lori Habas-Miller began talking of starting a family last year, they sold their 600-square-foot studio on the Upper West Side and looked at two-bedroom rentals. They soon discovered it would be wiser to buy a smaller apartment.
 ''You get much better living conditions when you own versus rent,'' Mr. Miller said last Friday as he and his wife checked on the newly finished floors in their one-bedroom apartment in Lincoln Towers. If the real estate market turns down, as he expects, ''we are in a much better place, because we put a lot of equity in from the sale of our other place, and we can upgrade to a two- or three-bedroom place.''
 The couple bought what is called a junior four and plan to close off one end of the kitchen and convert the dining area into another room to be used as a nursery when their first child, due in July, arrives.
 Local brokers report that junior fours -- or convertible twos -- are very popular among expecting couples or those with small children. ''They are absolutely accepting convertible twos or much smaller two-bedrooms than they would have taken in the past,'' said Elaine Clayman, an agent with Brown Harris Stevens.
 Real estate agents in Brooklyn, too, say that in some of the most popular neighborhoods for Manhattan refugees -- Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill and Park Slope -- families are configuring space creatively because prices have gotten prohibitively high. ''People are slicing up living rooms, turning living rooms into bedrooms, turning dining rooms into beautiful bedrooms and they are making kitchens smaller,'' said Mark Martov, a broker with Corcoran Group.
 The arrival of a second child might prompt families to look for larger apartments. But the marginal price of an extra bedroom keeps families of four packed into cramped quarters. A three-bedroom apartment costs, on average, $1.3 million more than an average two-bedroom apartment, according to Miller Samuel Inc., a real estate appraiser, which began tracking figures in the early 1980's and also noted the record high for two-bedroom apartments in the fourth quarter of 2003. 
 Mr. Lense, of Douglas Elliman, said he has talked to a couple who were thinking of buying a one-bedroom apartment to combine with their large junior four next door to make room for their second child. But when they could not make it work financially, they turned a hallway between the kitchen and the already-converted dining room into another nursery for the new baby.
 Small-time living is not easy, of course. During the first month after Hudson was born, Ms. Burns said, ''when the baby was crying all the time, it was really hard to be in this apartment and not be able to leave the room.'' She added, ''We did think, 'Oh my God, maybe we have been foolish,' because he was crying, and we were all so new, and we were frightened that maybe it is not good for any of us to be in the same room.''
 But she and Mr. Flynn worked out breaks. A few days after Hudson was born, Mr. Flynn crashed for several hours in a hotel room, where his parents, visiting from New Hampshire, were staying. 
 A couple of weeks later, he stayed with the baby while Ms. Burns went for a manicure and then for a walk with her father.
 Now, they have adapted to their snug arrangement. Ms. Burns, who is an actress, and Mr. Flynn, a writer and director, said they would probably have to move in about a year when Hudson starts walking. But even now, they need to escape occasionally to get what they delicately refer to as personal time. Luckily, Ms. Burns said, they have many friends, mostly without children, who are happy to baby-sit.
 Meanwhile, Ms. Shore and Mr. Heimes figured out that one of the keys to living in a small apartment with a child was not to go crazy stocking up on baby gear. ''You don't buy the million and one toys,'' Ms. Shore said. ''You go to friends' places and try out their toys, see which one your kid likes and buy that one.''
 She acknowledged that their way of living is not for everyone. ''Some people would probably say, 'I could never live in such close quarters,' '' Ms. Shore said. She and her husband rarely fight, she said. Grinning at Mr. Heimes, she added, ''He understands that I am always right.''

 BODY:

U.S. Online Gambling Policy Violates Law, W.T.O. Rules
The World Trade Organization, in its first decision on an Internet-related fight, has ignited a political, cultural and legal tinderbox by ruling that the United States policy prohibiting online gambling violates international trade law.
 The ruling was hailed by operators of online casinos based overseas as a major victory that could force America to liberalize laws outlawing their business. But the Bush administration plans to appeal. [Page C5.]

Ex-Executive of Dynegy Sentenced
Jamie Olis, a former tax-planning official at Dynegy, was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison for his role in a secretive project to disguise the company's financial difficulties. It was one of the most severe prison terms in recent memory for someone convicted of a white-collar crime. Two associates involved in the scheme, including Mr. Olis's former boss, pleaded guilty last year and are expected to receive sentences of less than five years. [C2.]

House Passes $2.4 Trillion Budget
The House, in a surprisingly close vote, approved a $2.4 trillion federal budget for next year by 215 to 212 and defeated efforts to block new tax cuts. [A14.]

Providers of Drug Discounts Named
The Bush administration selected 28 companies to provide drug discount cards to the elderly. The cards, intended for people who have no insurance for prescription costs, would cut prices 10 percent to 25 percent. [A10.]

Chief Ousted at German Chip Maker
Ulrich Schumacher, an outspoken German executive who sharply criticized his country's high taxes and rigid labor laws, was ousted unexpectedly as chief executive of Infineon Technologies. [World Business, Section W.]

U.S. Growth Strong in 4th Quarter
The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Commerce Department reported. [C5.]

Hewlett-Packard Is Suing Gateway
Hewlett-Packard has filed a lawsuit in a patent licensing dispute with Gateway. The lawsuit covers a suite of six patents for desktop, portable and server computers that had previously been licensed by eMachines, a South Korean maker of personal computers that Gateway acquired in January for $266 million. When Gateway acquired eMachines, Hewlett-Packard sought to terminate the licenses, maintaining that it had the right to prevent them from passing to Gateway. [C5.]

The solid reading on the economy gave investors some needed reassurance, propelling the Dow Jones industrial average up 170.59 points, to 10,218.82. The Nasdaq composite index soared 57.69 points, or 3 percent, to 1,967.17, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 17.86 points, to 1,109.19. [C7.]

A Top Russian Aide Raises Forecast
Just days after President Vladimir V. Putin publicly scolded his cabinet for not setting ambitious enough growth goals for Russia, the economics minister raised his outlook for Russia's growth this year to 6.4 percent from 5.2 percent, saying he now assumed higher oil prices. [World Business, Section W.]

Levitt Proposed for Big Board
Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was nominated for the New York Stock Exchange Board by the California Public Employees Retirement System. [C4.]

HEADLINE: Outspoken Chief Is Ousted At German Chip Maker

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 25 

 BODY:
Ulrich Schumacher, an outspoken German executive who sharply criticized his country's high taxes and rigid labor laws, was ousted unexpectedly on Thursday as the head of Infineon Technologies, the world's sixth-largest semiconductor maker.
 Infineon refused to disclose the reason for Mr. Schumacher's departure, causing some bewilderment among some shareholders. It named the chairman of its supervisory board, Max Dietrich Kley, as interim chief executive until it found a successor to Mr. Schumacher. 
 Executives close to Infineon said Mr. Schumacher, 45, had clashed with his deputies over his blunt management style and his plans to prepare the company for the next downturn in the volatile semiconductor industry.
 ''The main issue in this dispute was Schumacher's leadership style, which was criticized by many people as being overbearing,'' the company's main union, IG Metall, said in a statement.
 Representatives of Infineon's workers and unions, who under German law hold four seats on the company's board, backed the move to dismiss Mr. Schumacher, a person close to the company said.
 Among the changes being advocated by Mr. Schumacher, this person said, were further job cuts and the use of outside vendors to handle some back-office operations. Mr. Schumacher had also moved aggressively to build partnerships with semiconductor companies in Taiwan and China, which were drawing manufacturing jobs away from Germany.
 ''This allowed Infineon to get through probably the most difficult couple of years in the history of the semiconductor industry,'' said Ben Lynch, a technology analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York. ''But it clearly didn't endear him to the unions or to some members of the board.''
 Mr. Schumacher clashed with Infineon's chief financial officer, Peter Fischl, and its chief operating officer, Andreas von Zitzewitz, an executive close to the company said. They requested an emergency board meeting, and Mr. Schumacher lost a vote of confidence at the meeting. 
 Boardroom coups are rare in Germany, which cultivates a consensus style of management. Mr. Schumacher challenged that culture almost from the moment he took over Infineon in 1996. The company had its roots as the semiconductor arm of Siemens and was spun off in 2000.
 Early last year, Mr. Schumacher inserted Infineon into a national debate over Germany's tax code by threatening to move the company's headquarters, now in Munich, to Switzerland. He also regularly faulted Germany's labor laws, which make it difficult to lay off workers.
 ''In a consensus-driven industrial culture, he was certainly seen as willing to take risks,'' said Sean Murphy, a technology analyst at Nomura International in London. ''He was not afraid to upset people.''
 German newspapers sharply criticized Mr. Schumacher's threats, which came as Germany limped through a recession. With the rebound in the semiconductor industry, he had stopped talking about forsaking Germany.
 But in the last year, Mr. Schumacher heightened Infineon's profile in Asia, with chip-making partnerships with Nanya in Taiwan and the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation in China. He established an Asian headquarters in Shanghai.
 Such joint ventures are not unusual in the chip industry as a way to defray high capital costs. But Mr. Lynch said Infineon was more aggressive than other companies. ''They have the most momentum of the European players,'' he said. ''Infineon is in better shape than its competitors.''
 After enduring nine consecutive quarters of losses, the company earned a small profit last fall, and is expected to break even in the current quarter, analysts say.
 Mr. Schumacher's departure also deprives German industry of one of its more dashing personalities. A motor-racing enthusiast who regularly gets behind the wheel of vintage race cars, Mr. Schumacher kept the engine block of a 1973 Porsche 911 in his office.
 He was once considered a candidate to succeed Heinrich von Pierer as chief executive of Siemens, which owns a minority stake in Infineon. Now his future seems far less certain.

HEADLINE: Prescription for an Ailing Village: A Plastics Plant (Physician Required)

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
''Seducing Doctor Lewis,'' which will be shown tonight and tomorrow night in the New Directors/New Films series, takes place in a grizzled fishing village in Quebec. Its characters may speak French, but the film, the first feature directed by Jean-Francois Pouliot, would fit comfortably in a British comic tradition that stretches from the old Ealing Studios films to recent hits like ''The Full Monty,'' passing through Bill Forsyth's Scotland along the way.
 The movie finds humor in small-town idiosyncrasies, and also in economic hardship. The men of the village, Ste.-Marie la Mauderne, who once rose before dawn to take their living from the sea, now line up every morning for welfare checks. Germain Lesage (Raymond Bouchard), the portly, perpetually unshaven hero, is desperate to restore the town's decrepit pride. A plastics company is looking for a site for a new factory, and Germain places himself at the head of the campaign to promote Ste.-Marie. But the company stipulates that to be considered, the village must have a full-time resident doctor, one of many amenities it lacks. 
 Through complex and serendipitous circumstances, Christopher Lewis (David Boutin), an ambitious young Montreal internist, is lured away from the city, and what follows might be described as a subtitled amalgam of Mr. Forsyth's ''Local Hero'' and the television series ''Northern Exposure.''
 The locals, under Germain's direction, try to refashion their hamlet into something Dr. Lewis will find irresistible. Discovering that he loves cricket, these die-hard hockey fans become practitioners of a decidedly unorthodox (and very funny) version of the game. One, a skittish fellow named Steve (Bruno Blanchet), must pretend to share the doctor's passion for unlistenable jazz fusion played at high volume. When Dr. Lewis goes fishing, a frozen fish is surreptitiously attached to his line.
 ''Seducing Doctor Lewis,'' which is to be released by Wellspring on July 2 in Manhattan and July 16 nationwide, has an unusually commercial vibe for a New Directors selection. Its warm, sweet sentiments are genial and unchallenging, and its jokes are low-key and gentle. It will be preceded by ''Post Card,'' an animated short by Anna Matysik that uses nostalgic imagery to evoke the romance of pre-World War II Europe and its eventual destruction.

SEDUCING DOCTOR LEWIS

Directed by Jean-Francois Pouliot; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Ken Scott; director of photography, Allen Smith; edited by Dominique Fortin; music by Jean-Marie Benoit; production designer, Normand Sarrazin; produced by Roger Frappier and Luc Vandal; released by Wellspring. Running time: 108 minutes. This film is not rated. Shown with a nine-minute short, Anna Matysik's ''Post Card'' tonight at 8:30 at the MoMA Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, and tomorrow night at 6 at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, as part of the 33rd New Directors/New Films series of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the department of film and media of the Museum of Modern Art.

WITH: Raymond Bouchard (Germain Lesage), David Boutin (Christopher Lewis), Benoit Briere (Henri Giroux), Pierre Collin (Yvon Brunet), Lucie Laurier (Eve Beauchemin), Bruno Blanchet (Steve Laurin), Rita Lafontaine (Helene Lesage), Clemence Desrochers (Clothilde Brunet), Donald Pilon (Mr. Dupre), Ken Scott (Richard Auger) and Marie-France Lambert (Sylvie Auger).

HEADLINE: Fastest Growth In 2 Decades In '03 Last Half

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, and corporate profit increased, though at a slower pace than in previous periods.
 The reading on growth, unchanged from the government's earlier estimates, came after growth at an 8.2 percent pace in the third quarter, and resulted in the fastest six-month growth in almost 20 years, the report said. It included a revision showing that consumer spending grew more than previously estimated. 
 In another report, the Labor Department said that the number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless benefits edged up by 1,000, to 339,000 last week, remaining near a three-year low. 
 The number of people continuing to collect state jobless benefits dropped to 3 million in the week ended March 13 from 3.05 million a week earlier. The figure was the lowest since July 2001.
 ''There's going to be a period of more rapid employment growth that will likely go on for some time,'' William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told reporters before giving a speech in Memphis.
 Corporate profit rose last quarter for a third consecutive period, the Commerce Department said, up 31 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2002. Profit after taxes and adjusted for the value of inventories and capital depreciation increased 7.6 percent, to $961.9 billion at an annual pace. Corporate profit had risen at a 10.1 percent pace in the third quarter and 13.8 percent in the second quarter.
 Consumer spending, which accounts for most of the economy, grew at a 3.2 percent annual pace last quarter, faster than the 2.7 percent previously reported.
 Separately, data showed that resales of single-family houses climbed 2 percent in February. The increase brought the annual pace of such sales to 6.12 million houses in February from 6 million in January, the National Association of Realtors said. Home purchases have run at six million or higher for eight consecutive months.
 ''It's going to be another really strong year in 2004,'' said Jacob Stepan, chief operating officer of the Century 21 Real Estate Corporation. ''With the interest rates as low as they are, it's allowing people to buy houses they weren't able to in the past. The entire economy is on the rebound, and real estate is a key component of that.''

HEADLINE: Entitlements 'Crisis'

 BODY:
The latest projected shortfalls in financing Medicare and Social Security have brought the usual sober warnings that neither program is sustainable over the long run. The Social Security trustees reported this week that the fund would be exhausted in 2042, the same date projected last year, while Medicare trustees projected that their hospital insurance trust fund would be empty in 2019, seven years earlier than forecast last year. But don't jump off a bridge just yet. The financing problems are clearly manageable if political leaders will only address them, the sooner the better. 
 Although the challenges facing Social Security as the baby boomers reach retirement age are routinely described as a crisis, that characterization seems overblown. The 75-year projections give Social Security another 38 years during which the full promised benefits can be paid; even after the trust fund disappears, the annual Social Security tax revenue would be enough to finance some 70 percent of the benefits until 2078. Those worried that Social Security will not be there for them when they retire are simply mistaken. 
 No one should be complacent with a long-term projection that winds up with Social Security falling 30 percent short of the money it needs to pay for promised benefits. Fortunately, there is time to cope with this problem. The fixes that are needed appear modest, and they can be kept modest by making the changes sooner rather than later so the savings have time to accumulate.
 The prognosis for Medicare is far more worrisome. Its hospital insurance trust fund is now projected to run dry by 2019, and the parts of Medicare that pay for doctors' services and the new prescription drug coverage, which are financed mostly by general revenues rather than by the trust fund, are also expected to increase rapidly in cost. 
 What makes Medicare a tougher problem than Social Security is the inexorable rise in health care costs. The very long-term projections are stunning. The study estimated that Medicare expenditures would rise from 2.6 percent of gross domestic product today to 13.8 percent in 2078, roughly the percentage of G.N.P. that has historically been paid in federal income taxes. Such long-term projections must be taken with a huge dose of salt. Who really thinks that a prognosticator consulting a crystal ball 75 years ago, on the eve of the Depression, could have foreseen today's high-tech medicine?
 Nevertheless, there's a big problem here, and it reaches far beyond Medicare. There are few domestic policy issues more urgent than the need to get some kind of handle on the rising cost of medical care. Unless that underlying problem is solved, Medicare will inevitably require higher taxes or be forced to reduce benefits.
 Congress can certainly take a first step in dealing with the looming entitlement shortfalls by rebuffing the administration's efforts to extend its tax cuts for wealthy Americans. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal analytical group, estimates that if most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are made permanent, the revenue lost to the federal government in the next 75 years would roughly equal the combined Social Security and Medicare trust fund shortfalls over that period. It would be irresponsible for lawmakers to wring their hands over entitlements and yet deny the government the revenue that could ease the problem.

HEADLINE: Trade Group Says U.S. Ban on Net Gambling Violates Global Law

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization, in its first decision on an Internet-related dispute, has ignited a political, cultural and legal tinderbox by ruling that the United States policy prohibiting online gambling violates international trade law.
 The ruling, issued by a W.T.O. panel on Wednesday, is being hailed by operators of online casinos based overseas as a major victory that could force America to liberalize laws outlawing their business. 
 But the Bush administration vowed to appeal the decision, and several members of Congress said they would rather have an international trade war or withdraw from future rounds of the World Trade Organization than have American social policy dictated from abroad.
 ''It's appalling,'' said Representative Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican. ''It cannot be allowed to stand that another nation can impose its values on the U.S. and make it a trade issue.'' 
 The decision stems from a case brought to the W.T.O. in June 2003 by the tiny island nation of Antigua and Barbuda. The nation, which licenses 19 companies that offer sports betting and casino games like blackjack over the Internet, argued that United States trade policy does not prohibit cross-border gambling operations.
 Antigua and Barbuda further argued that the United States would be hypocritical to do otherwise since it wants to allow American casino operations to operate land-based and Internet-based units overseas. 
 It is not clear precisely why the dispute panel of the trade body ruled in favor of Antigua and Barbuda, since the specifics of its decision remain confidential. The ruling covers only online casinos based on the islands, near Puerto Rico, but other nations could seek similar rulings, legal experts said.
 Sir Ronald Sanders, the islands' chief foreign affairs representative, said he thought it was clear from the decision that the United States must liberalize its online gambling regulations or risk being hypocritical about its stance on free trade.
 ''The U.S. says it wants open competition,'' he said. ''But it only wants free trade when it suits the U.S.'' 
 The issue has emerged at the nexus of already complicated legal and social issues muddied further by the borderless reach of the Internet. Millions of Americans now gamble over the Internet, using credit cards or online payment services to wager on sports contests or at games like poker, blackjack and roulette.
 Under federal law, it is illegal to offer sports bets over the Internet or to operate other gambling operations not otherwise allowed by individual states. State laws vary widely, with some allowing specific forms of gambling within their borders. Some states criminalize the placing of a bet, but others, like New York, do not make it a crime to bet online.
 Online casinos are typically based in Costa Rica or the Caribbean, but also in Britain. Their business continues to grow, but not nearly as fast as industry experts once projected; the slower growth has come in part because many banks do not allow their credit cards to be used to place bets.
 Also, the Justice Department has begun to crack down on American broadcasters and publishers that advertise on behalf of online casinos. The crackdown, based on an untested legal theory that American companies are aiding an illegal enterprise, has limited the ability of online casinos to reach Americans.
 Sebastian Sinclair, a research analyst who studies the Internet gambling industry, said he doubted the W.T.O. decision would affect America's internal policies and instead could strengthen the resolve of policy makers who want to see the activity prohibited. At the same time, he said the decision showed the gulf in policy on the issue between America and much of the world.
 ''We're going down one path, and the rest of the world is going down a completely different path,'' said Mr. Sinclair, an analyst with Christiansen Capital Advisors.
 Mr. Sinclair added that the ruling was as a ''nonevent'' for the Las Vegas casinos and other legal gambling operations in the United States because they risk losing their charters if they open a casino -- online or otherwise -- that in any way violates the licenses in states where they operate. Those state licenses could, for example, preclude legal casinos from offering wagers to Americans where gambling is not permitted.
 Sir Ronald, the official from Antigua and Barbuda, said that two years ago the nation, which has a population of less than 100,000, had 119 online casinos with 5,000 employees. Today, he said, its 30 operations have about 1,000 employees.
 He argued that if the United States loses an appeal before the W.T.O. and then continues to prohibit online gambling, Antigua and Barbuda would be within its international rights to raise tariffs on American companies doing business there. Sir Ronald said that since 90 percent of what his country consumes it imports from the United States, the impact could be severe for American companies like AT&T.
 He said America has frequently used the trade organization to further its interests, including forcing nations to make internal policies consistent with international law. He did not cite specific examples. 
 Mr. Goodlatte said that the United States did not expect to change its policy and that the people of Antigua and Barbuda ''may have a mini-trade war on their hands.''
 The congressman, along with Senator John Kyl, a Republican from Arizona, said he would question America's participation in future agreements under the auspices of the World Trade Organization.
 David Carruthers, chief executive of Betonsports.com, an Internet sports book operation and casino with headquarters in Costa Rica and back-office operations in Antigua and Barbuda, said he hoped the W.T.O. decision would lead to legalized online gambling in America.
 In 2003, he said, his company took 33 million bets from people in North America, most of them in the United States. He said he had 1.2 million registered customers who are United States residents.
 ''This could be the straw that breaks the camel's back,'' he said. ''It's a victory for the people of Antigua but also for consumers in the United States.''

HEADLINE: So, It's Jets Versus Striped Bass?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
REMEMBER the old joke about the eternally optimistic boy? Nothing could faze him, not even waking up on Christmas Day to find a lump of horse dung in his stocking. ''There's a pony around here somewhere,'' he said brightly.
 The skeptical flip side to that is pure New York. It came to mind yesterday on the long walk from the nearest subway stop to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, by the Hudson River. ''There's striped bass around here somewhere,'' the thought ran. 
 Striped bass, for those with dim memories of the 1980's, helped doom Westway, the road that was supposed to run along Manhattan's western fringe. The Westway project died for several reasons, but the poor bass was what fired up many opponents, especially environmentalists. They warned that the Hudson's stock of that fish would be imperiled.
 You just know that someone is already searching for striped bass or its equivalent to kill plans, formally announced yesterday, for a greatly expanded Javits center and an adjoining stadium for the football Jets, currently of New Jersey. Before this ambitious project can take wing, it will face environmental scrutiny, zoning studies, legislative reviews and -- count on it -- court fights.
 Cue the bass.
 Between eternal-sunshine pronouncements from the plan's supporters and world-is-ending gloom from the opponents, you had a splendid example yesterday of what makes New York at once so joyful and maddening. Spirited debate is the lifeblood of the city. But it is often also what keeps anything from ever getting done here.
 First, the negative voices, a mixture of politicians and West Side community leaders who called the stadium idea fatally flawed.
 Don't misunderstand, they said yesterday; expanding the Javits center is fine. But ''responsible development'' requires dropping the stadium, officially known as the New York Sports and Convention Center. It would, they warned, bring in too many cars, increase pollution, disrupt the neighborhood and potentially throw thousands out of their homes (even though the sports center would be built over state-owned rail yards, where presumably only the homeless sleep).
 In their criticism were echoes of arguments that have been used to defeat or endlessly delay countless projects requiring government involvement. It is almost as if the very will to build on a grand scale has been numbed.
 Whether the issue is an essential water filtration plant to go underneath Van Cortlandt Park or a desperately needed subway to run along Second Avenue, the civic motto sometimes seems to be, ''Don't just do something -- stand there!''
 You have to wonder what would have happened if Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted had worked in today's political climate. Would Central Park have come into being? More than likely, it would have ended up a fraction of its present size. People were displaced for that project, too.
 ON the other hand (this is one of those columns with lots of hands), some were left cold by rosy assurances from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki that the stadium concept is, unlike the Jets, a sure winner. 
 For one thing, the politicians themselves said little yesterday about the stadium as a lure to bring the 2012 Summer Games to New York. Perhaps Olympic dreams have faded along with the international spirit of ''We are all New Yorkers'' that prevailed right after 9/11.
 Another issue is whether most Jets fans, suburbanites in the main, will leave cars behind and take the promised extension of the No. 7 subway line to the stadium. The Jets say yes, based on surveys. But look at Yankee and Shea Stadiums, both with excellent train connections. Only one fan in four takes mass transit to those ballparks.
 There is yet another question: has New York pride suffered for lack of a football team? Hardly. Since 1984, when the Jets absconded to New Jersey, the city has enjoyed a renaissance, physically and spiritually.
 As for cold cash, studies suggest that sports franchises are poor engines of economic development. Should financing arrangements for the $1.4 billion stadium go awry, we might have to rename this team the New York Debts.
 In unveiling the project, Mr. Bloomberg began by saying, ''If you don't have a smile on your face today, you're never going to have one.''
 It sounded almost like a curse. Torn between the sunshine boys and the doom-and-gloomers, many New Yorkers were too conflicted yesterday to smile.

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Prices Drop 4% On Doubts Over OPEC Cuts

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Crude oil prices sank 4 percent yesterday as doubts grew that OPEC would be able to carry out a planned April 1 production cut. 
 Light crude settled $1.50 lower in New York, at $35.51 a barrel.
 Prices began to slide Wednesday after government data showing a much bigger than expected increase in the nation's crude stocks last week. 
 The Energy Information Administration reported inventories of crude oil had increased by 7.5 million barrels, to 288.6 million barrels, after a surge in imports, particularly from Nigeria, an OPEC member, to an average 10.1 million barrels a day. 
 The downward momentum gathered pace yesterday after Nigeria said that it was already too late for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to go ahead with a cut of a million barrels a day planned for April 1. 
 ''When we met in February, the conception was we would have to confirm the cut in order to influence liftings. We have not done that,'' Edmund Daukoru, Nigeria's presidential adviser on oil, said. 
 ''We are meeting on March 31 and expect the cut to take effect the following day,'' he added, ''but the timing for the practical impact has slipped. There is effectively a delay in the announcement of the cut.'' 
 The American energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, said the United States was talking with OPEC members about the group's production ahead of the cartel's meeting next week in Vienna. 
 But he declined to elaborate, saying the policy of the administration was to keep the discussions ''private.'' 
 Mr. Abraham also defended the Bush administration's refusal to stop filling the nation's emergency crude oil stockpile, which a growing number of lawmakers from both political parties have demanded as a way to keep more oil in the open market. 
 ''It is very likely that if we did curtail filling the reserve, that would be offset by a reduction in production by OPEC,'' he said. 
 OPEC ''is fully capable, if it desires to, to offset anything we might do'' like halting deliveries to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Mr. Abraham added.

HEADLINE: L.P.G.A. Comes Around To Benefits of Diversity

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS

DATELINE: RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. 

 BODY:
THROUGH a novel strategy of inclusion, the new tour of enlightenment has defused the sabotage of whispers that once cultivated an entrenched fear of letter association -- as in the L Word and the L.P.G.A.
 Now that Rosie Jones has put her name to the taboo this week, now that the veteran has come out to promote sundecks for lesbians on Olivia cruise lines, the defeating murmurs have lost their traction.
 ''It's out there,'' said Juli Inkster, tour icon and working mom, talking two days before she teed off for yesterday's first round of the Kraft Nabisco Championship here. ''People have got to get over it.'' 
 Through cultural evolution, and exhaustion of denial, the L.P.G.A. has come to grips with lesbianism -- finally. In the past, the outing of a player would have left tour officials nervously coughing through their reflexive battle cry: ''Look over there. It's Nancy Lopez.''
 But on Wednesday, Commissioner Ty Votaw, in the sixth year of his image-renovation plan, offered unconditional support for Rosie's choice to wear her orientation on her sleeve -- and stitched on her visor. 
 ''Our approach is that if you can play great golf, we don't care what your sexual orientation is; we don't care what your background is; we don't care what country you come from; we don't care what other characteristics you have,'' Votaw said. ''If you can play great golf and can represent the ideals and values of being a professional golfer on the L.P.G.A. Tour, we welcome you with open arms.''
 It may be a little wordy for a bumper sticker, but Inkster spelled out the L.P.G.A.'s current melting-pot marketability when adding, ''We've got it all out here.''
 It's Neopolitan ice cream, with athletes who are gay and straight, from Mexico to Mishicot, Wis., from municipal links and private clubs. The L.P.G.A.'s forced image of sameness has vanished. 
 Success has been liberating for the L.P.G.A. No doubt social transition arrives easier when there has been a 14 percent rise in attendance, 26 percent pop in network viewers and 19 percent growth in the cable audience, all since 2001.
 In a beleaguered sports economy, the L.P.G.A. retained all of its sponsors from 2003. In an era of big-event fatigue, the L.P.G.A. has two of the most fascinating draws in sports. 
 Who isn't enamored of Michelle Wie when the teenager swings like Paul Bunyan? Who wasn't taken with Annika Sorenstam when her human heart fluttered like hummingbird wings against the PGA's best last year? 
 By holding their own against testosterone, and creating the invaluable element of intrigue, Wie and Sorenstam have given the tour credibility, pulling in skeptics who had mentally linked the women's game to red tees and Bermuda shorts.
 It's about managing momentum, though. So far, Votaw has been able to welcome new fans while not alienating the devoted core. That's why support for Rosie Jones -- who finished a stroke behind the leader, Aree Song, yesterday -- is just as important to the tour as the progress of Mexico's Lorena Ochoa, who tied Rosie for second. In other words, think globally; act locally. 
 Pushing mass appeal via grass roots is an innovative approach shot for sports leagues and tours. Why go broad, when you can go narrow? 
 A decade-long obsession with sex appeal has left the women's tennis tour struggling for an identity. Who are they without Anna to toss her blond mane in a huff? 
 A post-Jordan fascination with hip-hop marketing has, at times, transformed the N.B.A. scene into an endless loop of MTV's ''Cribs.'' What about its tone-deaf fan on the Naugahyde couch? 
 A faith-based reliance on Tiger Woods to pump up ratings and prize money could leave the PGA Tour in a bind if his greatness fizzles to normal levels. How visible is a PGA scoreboard without Tiger in the top 10? 
 A hypocritical habit of using violent images to promote matchups and peep shows as Super Bowl entertainment has left the N.F.L. at risk of excluding young fans because of parental controls.
 There is a template for success, though. The L.P.G.A. headquarters is in Daytona Beach, Fla., located all but under the hood of Nascar -- experts at popularity through individual approachability. But not even Nascar has the asset the L.P.G.A. possesses: diversity.
 Dimension has its advantages, and its minefields. Perhaps overcome by peroxide fumes last year, Jan Stephenson blasted the growing cast of brunettes on the tour she once adorned when she told Golf Magazine, ''The Asians are killing our tour, absolutely killing it.''
 Instead of ignoring it, Votaw and Company offered a rebuke of the quoted bias while recognizing the issue beneath Stephenson's rant. Truth was, a cultural divide did exist between introverted Korean stars and more extroverted tour members.
 Quickly, the tour veterans sat down with the affable Grace Park -- a South Korean by birth, but reared as a mall-lovin' American teenager -- and asked her to become an international liaison on the L.P.G.A.'s board of directors. 
 Crisis managed, all in the spirit of acceptance. How enlightened of the L.P.G.A. How business savvy, too.

HEADLINE: Missile Defense for Airliners Is Possible Soon, Makers Say

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
Government contractors who were asked to find a way to protect passenger jets from small shoulder-fired missiles in Al Qaeda's arsenal have determined that some planes could be outfitted with antimissile technology as early as this summer, far sooner than the Bush administration has suggested was possible.
 The contractors' assessment, revealed in recent statements at industry gatherings and in interviews with executives, is likely to increase pressure on the administration to begin installing antimissile devices, particularly on larger planes flying to foreign destinations where Al Qaeda terror cells pose a clear threat.
 The technology has been installed on military planes for years, offering laser-jamming equipment and decoy flares to deflect small missiles that are known to be in Al Qaeda's stockpiles.
 ''Can we do it in 90 to 120 days and protect the aircraft? Absolutely,'' said Paul Handwerker, a business development executive at BAE Systems, a British military supplier that is leading one of three groups of contractors selected by the Department of Homeland Security in January to develop the technology for passenger jets. 
 Mr. Handwerker said that while he agreed with the reasoning behind the government's timetable, the company's engineers ''would find a way to do it much faster'' if the request was made.
 Jack Pledger, an executive who oversees antimissile systems for Northrop Grumman, another contractor selected for the program, said that laser-jamming devices installed by Northrop on military planes could be quickly converted to passenger jets. ''We could do it right now,'' Mr. Pledger said. ''If it became necessary to provide this system immediately, we're ready.''
 Western intelligence and law enforcement agencies have repeatedly warned in recent months that Qaeda terrorists intend to shoot down American and other Western passenger planes with shoulder-fired missiles, which can be bought on the black market for as little as $5,000 and weigh as little as 35 pounds.
 In November 2002, two small Russian-made SA-7 missiles fired by terrorists believed to be loyal to Osama bin Laden's network barely missed an Israeli passenger jet on takeoff from Mombasa, Kenya.
 Last year, the threat of a missile attack was considered so serious at Heathrow Airport in London that troops were stationed along flight paths into the airport for several days. A British arms dealer was arrested in New Jersey last summer on charges that he tried to sell a Russian-made surface-to-air missile to an American undercover agent posing as a Qaeda operative; the case against him is pending.
 A study last November by the Congressional Research Service cited estimates from counterterrorism specialists of more than 5,000 small missiles in the stockpiles of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Although Al Qaeda has never been tied to the downing of a passenger plane in a missile attack, the study noted that there had been at least five missile attacks on large passenger jets around the world since 1983, two of them resulting in the destruction of the aircraft and the deaths of all 171 people on board. Four of the attacks were in Africa, including the one in Mombasa. One attack was in Afghanistan.
 The Homeland Security Department announced last year that it was setting aside $100 million for a program to determine whether antimissile devices could be installed on passenger planes, with prototypes built this year or next.
 The department's timetable has been criticized on Capitol Hill, where a group of lawmakers, most of them Democrats, has urged the government to move much faster and to commit billions of dollars to begin equipping planes immediately.
 The department says that it is moving as quickly as it can and that it would be irresponsible to try to outfit passenger planes until the reliability, safety and cost-effectiveness of the antimissile device is demonstrated.
 They note that military antimissile systems cost as much as $3 million per plane, require intensive maintenance and can produce a high rate of false alarms, factors that could be economically disastrous to the nation's already-beleaguered airline industry.
 ''What we're trying to avoid is taking shortcuts,'' said John J. Kubricky, who is directing antimissile research programs at the Department of Homeland Security. ''I can't think of any way to speed this up and to do it safely and economically.''
 Mr. Kubricky said antimissile technology developed for high-performance military jets was not readily applicable to passenger planes, which fly for hundreds of hours without extensive maintenance. ''It's like taking the family car and comparing it to a Nascar racer,'' he said.
 In January, the department announced that three groups of technology contractors -- one led by BAE Systems, one led by Northrop and one led by United Airlines, a division of UAL Corporation, and Avisys, a small technology company in Texas -- had each been awarded $2 million contracts to determine how passenger planes might be outfitted with military-style antimissile devices.
 In announcing the awards, the department said it was trying to determine if there was ''viable and effective'' technology to protect passenger jets.
 The recent comments of the contractors have alarmed officials at the Department of Homeland Security, and they have urged the contractors to refrain from such optimistic public pronouncements.
 The contractors say that while they can move more quickly, they are pleased to operate within the government's timeline. ''The Department of Homeland Security is taking a prudent and proper approach to evaluating the technologies,'' said Mr. Pledger at Northrop.
 Mr. Handwerker of BAE Systems said his company supported the department's goal of creating antimissile devices for passenger planes that ''make everything much more cost-effective, much easier to maintain -- orders of magnitude more reliable than what is normal in a military environment.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Expected to Put Penalties on Syria

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, which has debated for months whether to impose sanctions on Syria, is expected to announce them as early as next week, officials say, but there is an internal debate over whether the move will undercut the administration's outreach to Arab nations.
 Prodded by Congress, the administration will impose mostly economic sanctions against Syria, which the United States accuses of failing to cooperate fully in the fight against terrorism, the officials say.
 But they say they must wait until tempers have cooled in the region over Israel's assassination this week of the top Hamas leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, and until more time can be given for an American-backed initiative to encourage political and economic reform in Arab nations.
 The posture highlights the contradictory concerns in the administration as it seeks to promote more open and tolerant societies in the Arab world while making clear that it will not accept support for terrorist groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which receive Syrian support. 
 After weeks of interagency consultations, administration officials are focusing on adopting as many as three economic sanctions from a list contained in the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Act, which Congress overwhelmingly approved last year.
 The sanctions include a ban on American exports -- other than food and medicine -- to Syria, a prohibition on American businesses' investing or operating there, and a ban of transactions in which the Syrian government has any interest and that are subject to American jurisdiction.
 Syria has full diplomatic relations with the United States but few commercial ties, making the trade and investment bans largely symbolic. But advocates of sanctions said the potential for blocking financial transfers and the very fact of American opprobrium could be a powerful disincentive for potential foreign investors in Syria's oil industry.
 Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, an original sponsor of the legislation, said the government of Bashar al-Assad must pay for harboring terrorist leaders.
 ''It's important to both embarrass Syria as well as hurt their economy,'' said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican said. ''The Bush administration has done everything it could to show that Damascus has to change its course.''
 State Department officials acknowledged that they have received limited cooperation from the Assad government in recent months, but their position appeared to harden after they concluded last month that Damascus was ferrying weapons from Iran to radical anti-Israel groups in Lebanon. 
 ''As a general proposition, sanctions are a blunt instrument that should be only used as a last resort and in the most extreme circumstances,'' said Adam Ereli, the State Department spokesman. ''But this is a bed the Syrians have made for themselves.''
 The administration is promoting what it calls the Greater Middle East Initiative, a proposal to foster democratic, free-market reforms in Arab nations, with a free Iraq at its center. That project, which includes $120 million in financial aid, in addition to the billions the United States pumps each year into nations from Egypt to Pakistan, is off to a rocky start.
 Administration officials had hoped to advance the reform process by adopting a resolution among the world's wealthiest democracies later this year when the so-called G-8 members meet in June. 
 But even as it is still taking shape, the initiative has been criticized by some Arab and European nations, which accuse the United States of trying to dictate the future of the Middle East.
 ''There's a great deal of skepticism, because the U.S. traditionally has supported autocratic regimes in the region,'' said Farid Abboud, the Lebanese ambassador to Washington. He said the Bush administration should be careful in what it wishes for; truly democratic votes in several countries, he said, would reveal populations harshly critical of the administration's policies.

HEADLINE: Mr. Castro's Prisoners

 BODY:
Adolfo Fernandez Sainz, 56, is a translator, journalist and democracy advocate in Cuba. His current address is a cell in Holguin prison, nearly 500 miles from his family, which is permitted a two-hour visit every three months. Mr. Fernandez Sainz shares his cell with 47 common prisoners, one of whom beat him into unconsciousness in December. 
 Mr. Fernandez Sainz, who is serving a 15-year sentence, is one of 75 journalists, economists, librarians, human rights workers and doctors arrested in Cuba last March and later convicted. That crackdown jailed most of the nation's dissidents, whose supposed crimes include writing for Web sites based abroad, setting up independent libraries that offer books by the likes of Vaclav Havel and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and collecting signatures, in accordance with the Cuban Constitution, to petition for a referendum on fundamental reforms. 
 Cuba is not content to deprive these men -- and one woman, the prominent economist Martha Beatriz Roque -- of their liberty for what will be, in some cases, the rest of their lives. They are being held in hellish conditions, in many cases as far from their families as Cuba allows. They are in rat- and insect-infected cells, get starvation rations and are forced to share space with violent criminals or to suffer in solitary confinement. Their average sentence is 19 years. Some of the prisoners' wives have been warned that they will lose their children if they continue to protest their husbands' detentions.
 Sadly, foreign criticism of the Cuban government's repression has been muted. Last year at the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which meets annually in March and April, the members voted 31-to-15 against a resolution criticizing the crackdown. Instead, the commission approved a mild statement calling for a human rights monitor to visit the island; Cuba has simply not let her in. 
 The near appeasement of Fidel Castro is in large part due to the outside world's fury at Washington these days, which the Communist regime masterfully exploits. The U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva is again considering whether to condemn the Castro regime. The continued imprisonment of Cuba's brave independent thinkers is a totalitarian crackdown by a brutal dictatorship. President Bush's unpopularity aside, the international community must recognize this truth.

HEADLINE: Kerry Is Sticking With Plan to Raise Auto Fuel Efficiency

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 25 

 BODY:
In the face of rising gasoline prices and stagnating fuel efficiency, Senator John Kerry is sticking with a plan he backed in the Senate to increase the nation's fuel economy standards 50 percent by 2015. That would be the largest increase, by far, since automotive fuel economy standards were first imposed after the oil shocks of the 1970's. 
 Few think even Mr. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, could actually make good on such a plan if he were elected president, because there is too much opposition from Congressional Republicans and Midwestern Democrats. When Senator Kerry and Senator John McCain pushed such a proposal two years ago, it failed in the Senate on a 62-to-38 vote. 
 But Mr. Kerry's emergence as the likely Democratic nominee has reinvigorated debate in Detroit and Washington about the nation's plummeting fuel economy. 
 Environmental groups say they believe that bolstering fuel regulations would be Topic A, or close to it, in a Kerry presidency. The Bush campaign says the Kerry plan would have a devastating effect on a region already hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs. Automakers say they do not have the technology to meet his numbers. 
 And a who's who of top Democrats in Michigan, considered a battleground state, have been pressing Mr. Kerry to scale back. 
 ''We've all talked to the Kerry camp individually, and together,'' said Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat whose husband is one of two state campaign chairmen for Mr. Kerry. 
 ''We've had meetings with their people, there's been a series of discussions on this,'' she said, adding, ''he is not wedded to a particular miles per gallon and wants to work with the auto manufacturers and do this in a cooperative fashion.''
 Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, also said in an interview that Mr. Kerry was ''not locked into any particular approach or any particular number.''
 But the Kerry campaign Web site says ''we should increase our fuel economy standards to 36 miles per gallon by 2015,'' and the senator's campaign staff said he was sticking to that number, which is similar to his Senate proposal. 
 Cars and trucks, combined, are now required to average about 24 miles a gallon when they are tested in a lab by the Environmental Protection Agency. Out of the lab and on streets and highways, however, cars and trucks averaged 20.4 miles a gallon in the 2002 model year, the lowest point since 1980. And that figure excludes the largest and least-fuel-efficient vehicles, like Hummers, which are exempted from the regulatory system altogether. 
 Any current discussion of fuel economy is colored by the conflict in the Middle East, rising gas prices and surging global demand for oil, particularly in China. But amending corporate average fuel economy rules -- known as CAFE standards -- is also fraught with questions about jobs and safety. 
 Jobs, because the traditional Big Three -- General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler -- argue that raising standards would benefit foreign-based rivals, particularly an automaker like Honda that does not sell the largest vehicles. Safety, because one way to improve fuel economy is to make lighter vehicles, which tend to fare worse in crashes with heavier ones.
 But the safety question has been complicated by the boom in sport utility vehicles and large pickup trucks, which are heavy but less stable than cars. And a recent government study said lightening the heaviest S.U.V.'s and pickups would save lives by making them less lethal in collisions with other vehicles. 
 The Kerry approach stands in contrast to the Bush administration's plan to overhaul fuel economy standards for light trucks, a regulatory category that includes S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans. Though the planning is in its early stages, administration officials have said saving gas is not their top priority. They have envisioned a plan that would potentially do away with a single fleetwide average for light trucks and replace it with multiple mileage targets, depending on size or weight, on the theory such a plan would save lives. 
 The two sides cited competing studies to bolster their arguments. Scott Stanzel, President Bush's campaign press secretary, said an analysis by the Energy Information Administration concluded that the Kerry plan would cost 450,000 jobs and result in $170 billion in ''lost economic output'' from 2003 to 2020. 
 David Wade, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, said his candidate ''won't accept George Bush's false choice between the environment and jobs.'' 
 Mr. Kerry has said his plan would create half a million jobs because it would offer incentives for domestic manufacturers to retool plants to build more efficient vehicles, pay for advanced technology research and create tax incentives for consumers to buy clean vehicles. 
 The United Auto Workers, which has endorsed Mr. Kerry, has not embraced either plan. The union opposed the Kerry plan in 2002 and recently joined with the Sierra Club to write an essay for The New York Times's Op-Ed page attacking the outlines of the Bush plan, saying it would ''hurt the environment, auto workers and the economy.'' 
 While campaigning, Mr. Kerry has framed fuel economy as a security issue. ''The threats that America faces today don't just come from gun barrels, they come from oil barrels -- and we need to disarm that danger,'' he said in a speech last year at the Detroit Economic Club. 
 President Bush has looked to hydrogen cars as a way to end America's dependence on crude oil imports, but many automakers and analysts see that futuristic technology as being decades away.
 Most of the industry has long fought against significant increases in fuel economy standards, arguing that they would hinder the ability to build light trucks, which now account for more than half of new-car sales in the United States.
 Automakers have also said it is hard to sell the most fuel-efficient vehicles, though the early returns for hybrid electric vehicles sold by Toyota and Honda indicate a significant market. 
 Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of the Chrysler Group, said in a recent interview that when it came to cutting fuel consumption as much as Mr. Kerry has proposed, ''we can improve, we will improve, but it's technologically not possible to do it that fast, and that much.''
 Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes both domestic and foreign automakers, said: ''We certainly have disagreed with him about how extreme his CAFE proposal was, but we have met with him, talked with him and continued to work with him. Sometimes the position you have as a senator is different from the position you have as a president.''
 The 2002 Senate proposal backed by Mr. Kerry and Mr. McCain was bitterly opposed by the auto industry. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said it would ''effectively eliminate sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks.'' G.M. sponsored rallies with the U.A.W. at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin to oppose the measure and said it would lead to 100,000 lost jobs. 
 Environmental groups argue that automakers in Detroit, Japan and Germany have the technology to build more efficient vehicles but will not do so unless prodded by regulation. They note that Ford plans this year to sell a hybrid S.U.V. that will get 30 to 40 miles a gallon. And California, which is authorized to set its own air quality standards, has already moved to force the industry to cut emissions of smog-forming pollutants and global-warming gases. 
 ''Raising the CAFE standards has been a major priority for the environmental community to cut our oil dependence, and pollution,'' said Daniel Becker, a global warming expert at the Sierra Club. ''We're delighted it has been a major priority of John Kerry.''

	 	 		--------------------	 	

E.P.A. Seeks Comment
 DETROIT, March 25 (Reuters) -- The Environmental Protection Agency has opened the door to possible revision of its fuel economy tests.
 The move came in response to a petition filed nearly two years ago by an environmental group, the Bluewater Network, which contends the current auto stickers overstate fuel economy values.
 In an advisory on its Web site, the E.P.A. said Wednesday that it would publish a notice in the Federal Register soliciting comment from all interested parties on Bluewater's call for a revision of its test procedures within 120 days.

HEADLINE: After Word From Putin, A Top Aide Raises Forecast

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 25 

 BODY:
Just days after President Vladimir V. Putin publicly scolded his cabinet for not setting ambitious enough growth goals for Russia, the economics minister raised his forecasts for the economy on Thursday, citing high global oil prices.
 German Gref, the economic development and trade minister, raised his outlook for Russia's growth this year to 6.4 percent from 5.2 percent, saying he now assumed higher oil prices. With his outlook now hinged on higher oil, Mr. Gref said he also expected Russia's economy to average an annual 6.2 percent growth from 2005 to 2007. The government had expected growth of 5.8 percent in 2005. 
 ''The figures could turn out even higher, but budget policy requires us to be cautious and conservative,'' Mr. Gref told state television after a cabinet meeting.
 He said the government was now budgeting with an average price of $27.50 a barrel for Russia's Urals crude oil, up from $22 a barrel. Urals, Russia's main export crude blend, traded at $30.96 a barrel on Thursday. Urals crude has averaged $29.02 a barrel this year, up from $27.24 last year.
 ''By raising the oil price assumptions, by definition, Russia would have higher growth,'' said Peter Westin, senior economist at Aton Capital. Mr. Westin's own outlook is even more positive than Mr. Gref's: 7.2 percent growth for 2004 based on an average oil price of $27 a barrel.
 Amid the United States-led war in Iraq and a bull market for energy and commodities, Russia's economy has grown in the last four years, helping lift the country from post-Communist stagnation. The Kremlin's new projections, however, carried echoes of Soviet-era quotas, some analysts said.
 In a sharply worded message at the Ministry of Finance last Friday, Mr. Putin ordered Mr. Gref and other top economic officials to work at achieving annual economic growth of at least 5 percent, or higher. By the end of his second term in 2008, Mr. Putin aims to cut Russia's poverty level from just over 20 percent to a level somewhere from 10 percent to 12 percent. Last week, he prodded his ministers to stake their jobs on hitting those targets. 
 ''Do not be shy, just say it outright that this figure will be reached,'' he admonished Mr. Gref, who was present at the meeting at the Ministry of Finance. The president similarly warned other assembled ministers and officials: ''This applies to you all, too -- personal responsibility for the sector entrusted to you. If this entails negative consequences, you will be guilty,'' underscoring that the officials would be held personally responsible. 
 Some economists said that with his new forecast, Mr. Gref, a liberal, reform-minded but fiscally prudent cabinet member, was simply catching up with the consensus among private economists: that Russia's stunning growth is set to continue. 
 But others said the rosier forecast was a throwback to Soviet days, when government officials accommodated demands from the president by ''filling their quotas,'' even if the reported results were illusory.
 ''Gref has done a 180-degree turn,'' said Christopher Weafer, chief investment strategist at Alfa Bank in Moscow. ''A year ago, he was very conservative, and cautioning the government not to crank up budget expenditures based on unreliable revenue assumptions.'' 
 The Kremlin also signaled on Thursday that it was willing to rein in Russia's immensely profitable oil sector to stimulate growth in other parts of the economy. Mr. Putin has already hinted that he will raise taxes on Russian oil companies, although he has not set any precise new tax rates. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Gref confirmed that the state would be drastically slowing growth in oil exports. 
 Russia's oil exports should rise 14 percent, to 266 million tons this year, the equivalent of 4.83 million barrels a day, but then slow to 272 million tons in 2005 - only a 2 percent increase. Oil exports should rise again, by 2 percent, to 278 million tons in 2006, Mr. Gref said. The state controls most of Russia's oil exports via its oil pipeline monopoly, Transneft, considered a powerful lever over Russia's oil industry. 
 Mr. Putin has staked his presidency on doubling Russia's gross domestic product by 2012, and Alexander Zhukov, deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, said that the president's targets would be met. ''The Russian government sees this as one of its main goals,'' Mr. Zhukov said on Thursday. 
 Most economists, however, said that doubling an economy the size of Russia's in so short a period of time was implausible. 
 ''It's theoretically possible,'' Mr. Weafer said. ''But it's fair to say that if they do it, they deserve the Nobel Prize for economics.''

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

* ''THE DREAMERS,'' starring Michael Pitt, Eva Green and Louis Garrel. Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci (NC-17, 115 minutes). Mr. Bertolucci began his career with the observation that he who has not lived before the revolution has never tasted the sweetness of life. His newest film, an ardently romantic love song to sex, cinema and the spirit of the 60's, elaborates on this observation by finding sweetness in the midst of political tumult. The disturbances of 1968 in Paris take place mostly off screen, bursting in only at the end to wake up the three title characters. The three -- an American exchange student (Mr. Pitt) and a pair of lovely, moody half-French twins (Ms. Green and Mr. Garrel) -- spend most of the picture holed up in a luxuriously squalid Paris apartment, having sex and arguing about movies, politics and the relative merits of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Instead of mocking or patronizing their passion (as some critics are sure to do), Mr. Bertolucci treats these silly, earnest, beautiful young people tenderly and with generosity. As a testament to their love of movies, he inserts archival film clips culled from the repertory of the Cinematheque Francaise, where the three met and where the events of May began. To feed the audience's love, he photographs his fearless young actors and their surroundings with breathtaking grace. Even if the sight of naked bodies leaves you cold, some of the director's camera movements can make you gasp with delight (A. O. Scott).

* ''ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND,'' starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Directed by Michel Gondry (R, 108 minutes). Mr. Gondry's film, an angular and intelligent romantic comedy, isn't entirely consistent. Even as you laugh, it's a movie you admire more than love. Mr. Gondry, displaying an impressively quicksilver, scrambling technique, is working with a much better script than he had for ''Human Nature,'' his previous collaboration with the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. Ms. Winslet is Clem, the brash, loquacious bookstore employee who meets Joel (Mr. Carrey) as he wanders the streets alone on Valentine's Day. The two of them fall in love under a glum, flannel cloud cover that could use some eternal sunshine. After they break up, Joel finds out that Clem has had all memories of him erased from her mind. Devastated, he goes for the same treatment. The movie has all of the knickknacks of a Kaufman script, including a nerdy, socially inept protagonist. In the case of ''Mind,'' this translates into Joel's being the least developed character. Mr. Carrey does get to show some aplomb in the final scene, when Joel acts out the most mature sentiment ever found in a Kaufman script, that having one's psyche purged isn't necessarily a good thing (Elvis Mitchell).

* ''50 FIRST DATES,'' starring Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore and Rob Schneider. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 100 minutes). For the first few minutes this romantic comedy, directed by a veteran builder of ''Saturday Night Live'' star vehicles, looks like another crude, bullying Adam Sandler extravaganza: there are vulgar sexual jokes, a vomiting walrus and the never entirely welcome appearance of Mr. Schneider, who plays a Hawaiian stoner named Ula. But then Ms. Barrymore shows up as Lucy, a lovely art teacher suffering from temporal-lobe damage, and everything starts looking up. She goes after Mr. Schneider with a baseball bat and engages Mr. Sandler, who plays an easygoing, womanizing veterinarian, in a clever and touching romantic comedy. Lucy's injury has destroyed her short-term memory, so that she starts each day with no recollection of the one before. The film's conceit is reminiscent of Harold Ramis's immortal ''Groundhog Day.'' While ''50 First Dates,'' deftly directed by Mr. Segal from George Wing's witty and heartfelt script, does not have that film's philosophical ambitions, it does follow its premise to a risky conclusion that pays off beautifully (Scott).

* ''THE FOG OF WAR,'' with Robert S. McNamara. Directed by Errol Morris (PG-13, 106 minutes). If there is one movie that ought to be studied by military and civilian leaders around the world at this treacherous historical moment, it is Mr. Morris's sober, beautifully edited documentary portrait of Robert S. McNamara, the former defense secretary. Mr. McNamara, who was 85 when the interviews that make up the bulk of the film were conducted two years ago, served under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960's and has been widely vilified as a major architect of the Vietnam War. Subtitled ''Eleven Lessons From the Life of Robert S. McNamara,'' the movie organizes his hard-won observations into a list of maxims about war and human error whose cumulative message suggests that in wartime nobody really knows anything (Stephen Holden).

* ''GREENDALE,'' starring Sarah White and Eric Johnson. Written and directed by Bernard Shakey, a k a Neil Young (not rated, 93 minutes). Less a conventional movie than an album-length music promo, this set of linked vignettes about the Green family and the northern California town that bears their name is full of ornery wisdom and idiosyncratic sublimity. Mr. Young, in fine voice, balances his disgust at the current state of the world with his cranky faith in the resilience of the human spirit. The Greens -- especially Grandpa and Sun, a radiant environmentalist -- share their creator's stubborn defiance as they take on the media, the government and the soul-destroying, earth-polluting power of big corporations. The 10 songs that blanket the soundtrack are stripped-down anthems and lamentations, and they secure Mr. Young's position as an inimitable -- and indispensable -- rock 'n' roll prophet (Scott).

''HIDALGO,'' starring Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Joe Johnston (PG-13, 136 minutes). This much too long, primitively plotted family action adventure has a handful of well-handled sequences. But given the young audience this film is intended for, watching the picture is like having to finish an entire pot of broccoli to have a couple of jelly beans for dessert. The expansive and fairly unbelievable movie follows Frank Hopkins (Mr. Mortensen), who is persuaded to leave Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show to participate in the Ocean of Fire, a death-defying race across 3,000 miles of desert. The prize is $100,000. But the real star of ''Hidalgo'' is a handsome mustang who gets more glamorous close-ups than Joan Crawford did in her entire career. Eventually Frank and Hidalgo's Arabian journey is a testament to Frank's need for validation and is so full of incident that the movie is finally about as colorful, and convincing, as one of those penny dreadfuls about Buffalo Bill's own life (Mitchell).

''THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST,'' starring Jim Caviezel and Monica Bellucci. Directed by Mel Gibson (R, 120 minutes; in Aramaic and Latin, with English subtitles). Mr. Gibson's version of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus, controversial long before it was seen, is a harrowingly violent spectacle that invites the audience's revulsion in the hopes that it will turn into something like awe. After a horror-movie beginning, complete with demons, menacing music and creepy camera moves, Mr. Gibson settles into a long, relentless contemplation of torture, maiming and execution. His stated goal was realism, but the emphatic musical, visual and aural effects -- the first nail is driven into Jesus' palms with a sickening thwack that must have required hours of digital tweaking -- make the film a melodramatic exercise in high-minded sadomasochism. Despite concerns about the anti-Semitism of Mr. Gibson's portrayal of the Pharisees, the movie is more grueling and unnerving than outrageous or offensive. For a film made out of such evident religious conviction, it seems utterly lacking in grace (Scott).

''SECRET WINDOW,'' starring Johnny Depp, John Turturro and Maria Bello. Written and directed by David Koepp (PG-13, 97 minutes). If a movie requires the lead to spend a good chunk of his time on screen talking to himself, it's hard to do better than Mr. Depp, whose performance as the writer Mort Rainey is the highlight of this underwhelming film. A suspense thriller whose only suspense and thrills come from an audience wondering if the picture will hit its promised 97-minute running time, ''Secret Window'' dramatizes Mort's plight. He's suffering from writer's block, triggered by the tumultuous break-up of his marriage to Amy (Ms. Bello) and the protracted divorce proceedings. Mort lives in a remote cabin until a thunderous knock at the door rouses him from a sofa almost as lived-in as his bathrobe. The visitor is John Shooter (Mr. Turturro), who drawls menacingly, ''You stole my book.'' Sleepy and astounded, Mort gets the evidence shoved at him: Shooter's short story reads exactly like Mort's best-selling murder mystery, ''Secret Window.'' What's worse, Shooter gives Mort three days to set things right, or else. What little intrigue the movie has comes from Mort's shattered self-esteem; he asks himself if he really was capable of stealing Shooter's story vowel for vowel. Unfortunately, such a concern may not mean a whole lot to most viewers. Then again, neither will the whole of ''Secret Window,'' which has the vague plotting generally found in an anthology horror-show episode (Mitchell).

''SPARTAN,'' starring Val Kilmer and Derek Luke. Written and directed by David Mamet (R, 110 minutes). Mr. Mamet may not be a great filmmaker, but with this moody political thriller he proves himself, once again, to be a thrillingly competent one. His tightly coiled plot and swift, economical direction show up the bloat and incoherence that afflict most Hollywood suspense pictures these days, and the many little touches of Mametude -- jagged one-liners, swaggering repartee, William H. Macy -- make it unusually flavorful. Mr. Kilmer, his sorrowful cool nicely suited to the fiercely stylized acting Mr. Mamet requires, plays a secret agent who must rescue the kidnapped daughter of the president of the United States. The plot's twists and turns ultimately lead nowhere very interesting, but for much of its running time the picture hums along beautifully, fueled by a potent mix of technical assurance and professional braggadocio (Scott).

''STARSKY & HUTCH,'' starring Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Snoop Dogg. Directed by Todd Phillips (PG-13, 97 minutes). Mr. Phillips's big-screen adaptation has a crafty, can-you-dig-it? spirit derived from his affection for the 1970's and the original television cop series of the same name. The television show featured a pair of apparently plainclothes fuzz -- who were they supposed to be fooling? -- played by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. Mr. Phillips may not quite be a filmmaker, but he is on his way to becoming a director; his grasp of tone is a few steps ahead of his previous film, ''Old School.'' Starsky (Mr. Stiller) is probably one of those rare detectives who don't deserve the by-the-book speeches from their commanders. He is paired with another loner -- cool, shaggy Hutch (Mr. Wilson) -- who is a step away from being bounced from the force. Starsky and Hutch are tethered to a harness of buddy-movie cliches, but their congeniality comes from the actors' chemistry, demonstrated in several previous films together. Eschewing the confrontational machismo of the television series, the movie instead plays Starsky's zealous obliviousness against Hutch's low-rent worldliness. Still, the movie's advertising tag line (''Starsky & Hutch -- they're the Man'') needs to be amended. The film belongs completely and utterly to Snoop Dogg. Picking up the mantle of the police informant Huggy Bear, he's the man (Mitchell).

''TAKING LIVES,'' starring Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, Kiefer Sutherland, Olivier Martinez, Tcheky Karyo and Jean-Hugues Anglade. Directed by D. J. Caruso (R, 103 minutes). Ms. Jolie, the flesh-and-blood actress most likely to be mistaken for a computer-generated special effect, plays an F.B.I. profiler on the trail of a sick and ingenious serial killer. Is there anything more to say? Not really. There is the usual unsurprising surprise twist, the scene where the killer says to the profiler ''we're the same'' and a succession of gruesome crime-scene images. The film, competently directed by Mr. Caruso, does have one small claim to distinctiveness: it is one of the rare recent movies shot in Canada that is actually set there, rather than in someplace like New York or Chicago. That it is set in Quebec also allowed for the casting of Mr. Karyo, Mr. Martinez and Mr. Anglade, three fine French actors who add a soupcon of brooding Gallicism to this slick and phony genre exercise (Scott).

''TWISTED,'' starring Ashley Judd, Samuel L. Jackson, Andy Garcia and David Strathairn. Directed by Philip Kaufman (R, 97 minutes). The greatest mystery in this laborious, nonsensical thriller is why Mr. Kaufman, whose credits include movies like ''The Right Stuff'' and ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' bothered to lend his talents to such mediocre studio hack work. Ms. Judd, struggling mightily to convince the world that she has a dark, complicated side, plays Jessica Shepard, a San Francisco homicide investigator who also seems to be the prime suspect in her first big case. The victims of an apparent serial killer all turn out to have been men she slept with, and the fact that Jessica's father was a cop and a murderer makes the possibility of her guilt all the more plausible. Is she the killer, or is one of her friends and protectors -- her mentor (Mr. Jackson), her partner (Mr. Garcia), her shrink (Mr. Strathairn), her ex-boyfriend (Mark Pellegrino) -- setting her up? It is hard even to be curious, much less to care (Scott).

HEADLINE: RICE WOULD TAKE MORE QUESTIONS FROM 9/11 PANEL

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Adam Nagourney reported from Washington and Richard W. Stevenson from Nashua, N.H.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
Under mounting pressure from Democrats about its response to the investigation into the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the White House offered Thursday to have Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, answer more questions from the Sept. 11 panel. At the same time, President Bush forcefully denied accusations that he had ignored the severity of the threat from Al Qaeda.
 The White House announced late Thursday that Ms. Rice was willing to appear before the panel again, but only in private and not under oath. Some Republicans said that Mr. Bush was being undercut by the perception that a senior White House official would not cooperate, while his aides were out pummeling Richard A. Clarke, the former counterterrorism chief who has accused the Bush administration of not heeding warnings before Sept. 11. 
 The moves came as the White House also sought to deflect new criticism of Mr. Bush for his handling of counterterrorism issues in the months before the attacks and to contain the fallout of an investigation that Democrats and some Republicans said could cast a shadow over his re-election campaign.
 The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, called on the White House to cease ''character attacks'' on Mr. Clarke.
 ''I have a simple request for the president today: Please ask the people around you to stop the character attacks they are waging against Richard Clarke,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''Ask them to stop their attempts to conceal information and confuse facts. Ask them to stop the long effort that has made the 9/11 commission's work more difficult than it should be.''
 An array of White House officials, including Ms. Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney, have gone on television to discredit Mr. Clarke's testimony as either politically motivated, to help John Kerry, or as a ruse to sell books.
 In New Hampshire, Mr. Bush showed up at an event about the economy accompanied by the widow of a pilot of the plane that flew into the north tower of the World Trade Center. Only a day earlier, television news programs were filled with images of Mr. Clarke surrounded by thankful families of other Sept. 11 victims after he apologized to them for failing to head off the attack.
 Mr. Bush prefaced his remarks by pointedly noting that the commission was looking at ''the eight months of my administration and the eight years of the previous administration.''
 ''Had I known that the enemy was going to use airplanes to strike America, to attack us, I would have used every resource, every asset, every power of this government to protect the American people,'' Mr. Bush said to a burst of applause.
 In a letter to the commission's chairman, the White House counsel, Alberto R. Gonzales, said a return session would allow Ms. Rice to clear up ''a number of mischaracterizations'' of her statements and positions. Mr. Gonzales said she would not appear at a public session of the panel because, he wrote, it was critical that presidential advisers ''not be compelled to testify publicly before Congressional bodies such as the commission.''
 James R. Thompson, the former governor of Illinois and a Republican member of the commission, said in an interview on Thursday that in the commission's private four-hour interview of Ms. Rice last month, she offered to meet again with the panel to answer other questions. ''She said, 'If you need me back at any time, I'd be delighted,' '' Mr. Thompson said. ''So my guess is that we will call her back.''
 By publicly restating her offer on Thursday, the White House sought to deflect criticism that it was trying to block a full investigation of the Bush administration's performance in the months leading to the Sept. 11 attacks.
 Ms. Rice told commissioners that White House officials had told her she should not testify under oath. While the panel requires officials appearing in public to testify under oath, there is no such requirement for those testifying in private.
 The decision by Mr. Bush to directly address this issue underlines the extent to which the questions raised by Mr. Clarke and the commission appear to have shaken the White House. It came during a trip that was intended to address economic issues and to focus on New Hampshire, a state with a battered economy that is expected to be a critical in the presidential election. 
 Mr. Kerry, the expected Democratic presidential nominee, on Thursday again avoided directly engaging Mr. Bush on Mr. Clarke's assertions. Several advisers said they argued that an attack by Mr. Kerry at this point might be a welcome distraction to the White House, and make it easier to portray the criticism voiced by Mr. Clarke as orchestrated by the Kerry campaign.
 Some of Mr. Bush's advisers said they believed that they had raised enough questions about Mr. Clarke's motives and credibility to negate any damage he might have caused Mr. Bush with his statements to the panel, his just-released book and a steam of television appearances this week.
 ''Clarke's own words contributed to the end of his credibility with people,'' said Terry Holt, Mr. Bush's campaign spokesman.
 But Democrats and some Republicans not associated with the campaign questioned that assessment. They described Mr. Clarke's appearance before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States as compelling and said that Mr. Bush's campaign, which had already been criticized by some families of victims for using footage of World Trade Center destruction in its campaign advertisements, would have to deal with the emotional show of support by victims of Mr. Clarke after he said, ''I failed you.'' 
 In addition, even some Republicans questioned the wisdom of the White House involving itself in such a public and muscular campaign to discredit a critic who was, by his account, a Republican who served in Mr. Bush's own administration.
 ''While it was their intent to undermine Clark's credibility, it will be interesting to see if their credibility now comes into question more than his,'' said Don Sipple, a Republican consultant. ''I saw the parade of the victim's families on the morning shows who all applauded him. He was the first person who took any responsibility. What that does is underscore his perception as a truth teller. I think the American people are paying attention to this episode.''
 With the economy faltering and Democrats so united, Mr. Bush's terrorism credentials are portrayed by his supporters as the strongest assets he has going against Mr. Kerry. The revelations -- in particular, the account offered by Mr. Clarke -- could give Mr. Kerry ammunition to attack Mr. Bush on foreign policy.

HEADLINE: Libya Signs Energy Exploration Deal With Shell

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
Royal Dutch/Shell signed a breakthrough deal yesterday with Libya's state oil company to explore for oil and natural gas, a plan that could give Shell access to as much as $1 billion worth of fuel in North Africa.
 Abdalla Salem el-Badri, the Libyan oil minister and head of its National Oil Corporation, and Malcolm Brinded, Shell's chief executive for exploration and production, met in Tripoli to sign the deal as Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain arrived in the city to meet with Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's leader. 
 It was the first visit to the country by a British leader since Mr. Qaddafi seized power in 1969. 
 The deal, which is likely to irk American energy rivals that have been gearing up to enter Libya once the Bush administration lifts sanctions, establishes guidelines for projects including onshore exploration and the export of liquefied natural gas.
 It was the first time in 30 years that Shell -- the British-Dutch giant, with headquarters in The Hague -- had been invited to operate on Libyan soil. ''I look forward to our cooperation becoming a cornerstone in a renewed trade relationship between the U.K. and Libya,'' Mr. Brinded said in a statement.
 Analysts estimate that Libya, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has production capacity of about 1.6 million barrels a day, which is about 23 percent more than its current OPEC quota of about 1.3 million barrels a day.
 The country's reserve potential, however, is far larger, analysts say. ''The reserves are huge'' and underused, said Bruce Evers, an analyst at Investec Investment Banking in London.
 Mr. Evers said the country's infrastructure suffered from ''a chronic lack of inward investment because of the sanctions'' imposed in 1992 by the United Nations in connection with Libya's role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
 Shell has been under increasing pressure to find new sources of oil after the company sharply reduced estimates of its oil and gas reserves in recent months.
 ''Clearly this is the biggest bit of good news that Shell has had this year,'' Mr. Evers said. ''They've been stalking the Libyans ever since relations thawed.''
 Angus McPhail, an analyst with ING Financial Markets in London, agreed that the deal was a welcome development for the company.
 ''This is potentially a very lucrative deal,'' Mr. McPhail said.
 The United States Justice Department has opened an inquiry into whether executives at the Royal Dutch/Shell Group violated any laws by failing to disclose soon enough a significant shortfall in reserves of oil and natural gas.
 Shares of Shell Transport and Trading, the British arm of Shell, which represents 40 percent of the group, rose 0.63 percent on the news, to $:3.58 ($6.53), in London. Royal Dutch Petroleum, which trades in Amsterdam, rose 0.24 percent, to 37.92 euros ($46).
 But analysts were also quick to point out that investors were still unsettled by Shell's recent restatements of its oil reserves, a factor that they said was likely to overshadow the Libyan deal in the longer run.
 ''The market is still factoring a corporate governance discount into the stock,'' Mr. McPhail of ING said. ''They still have to prove themselves to the market. Libya is just one small piece of a much larger and complex jigsaw puzzle.''
 Analysts also said that Shell's deal was likely to increase pressure on the Bush administration by American oil companies, including Occidental Petroleum and Exxon Mobil, to lift sanctions that continue to bar American companies from investing in Libya.
 ''Clearly this is going to put a lot of pressure on Bush to get in there and make things happen for the Americans,'' said Mr. Evers of Investec. ''It is not every day that an OPEC member comes out and says, 'Come on down.'''

HEADLINE: Facing Long Road, West Side Makeover Gets a Big Sendoff

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Amid klieg lights, heavy security, a model and a billboard-size rendering, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Gov. George E. Pataki and Woody Johnson, the owner of the Jets, finally announced a $2.8 billion project yesterday that had been years in the making: the expansion of the city's convention center on the far West Side and the construction of a 75,000-seat stadium for the football team.
 The fact that they could get state and city officials in the same room at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, along with some union leaders, hotel owners and real estate executives, was a step forward after years of talk, false starts, squabbling and back-room trade-offs. The event was a result of the single-mindedness and perhaps the naivete of the deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel L. Doctoroff. 
 The stadium and convention center expansion are the crucial components of the city's bid for the 2012 Olympics, which Mr. Doctoroff cobbled together before he entered city government. He has sought to ram them through the usual political and economic barriers like a fast-moving train, but he still has a long way to go. The announcement yesterday was his way of saying the train was leaving the station. 
 The project he and the Pataki administration announced yesterday still needs approval from the State Legislature, where Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said yesterday that he had ''serious concerns and reservations.'' Mr. Silver said he opposed the city's plans to use $350 million from the Battery Park City Authority to help pay for the Javits expansion. 
 Elements of the projects also need approval by the City Council, where some members are angry that the city would spend $300 million on a stadium when it cannot find enough seats for schoolchildren. And everyone expects that critics, ranging from neighborhood groups to Broadway theater owners and Cablevision, will file lawsuits, a tactic that held up the redevelopment of Times Square for nearly a decade. 
 One of Mr. Doctoroff's biggest challenges may be in trying to keep his ostensible allies -- the hotel industry, various state officials and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- on board his speeding train. The transportation agency wants to be able to sell development rights that it says are worth $400 million to $600 million for allowing the city to build over its railyards. But those are the same development rights Mr. Doctoroff wants to sell to pay for a western extension of the No. 7 subway line.
 ''This is a local train, and it's going to make many stops,'' Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat vowed. Mr. Espaillat, a Democrat from Washington Heights, supports the Javits expansion, but opposes the stadium.
 But for at least one morning in front of the television cameras, all the principal actors were singing together in harmony at the Javits Center. That was a lot more than anyone accomplished for previous stadium dreams, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's failed four-year quest to build a new home for the Yankees.
 Mayor Bloomberg unveiled what he called a ''historic plan to transform and modernize'' the city's convention industry by creating a half-mile convention corridor along 11th Avenue, from 30th to 40th Street. The state and the city would put up $1.3 billion for the projects, while the Jets said they would invest $800 million in the stadium.
 ''It truly marks a milestone,'' an ebullient Mr. Doctoroff said yesterday, ''not only in the history of the far West Side, but for the entire city.''
 The proposal would nearly double the size of the Javits Convention Center by expanding it north to 40th Street, enabling the center to attract larger and more varied conventions and trade shows. The proposal also calls for building a convention hotel and ballroom on 42nd Street.
 The $1.4 billion expansion would be covered by a temporary hotel surcharge of $1.50 a night, which would raise $500 million, and by $350 million each from the state and the city. The mayor said he expected a developer to invest $200 million in the hotel, although convention experts note that convention hotels are usually heavily subsidized and a developer is unlikely to invest such a large sum.
 The city said its $350 million share would come from reserve funds from the Battery Park City Authority, an arrangement that would seem to violate Mr. Doctoroff's longstanding promise to pay for West Side projects with new tax revenues generated in the area, not with existing municipal money. Every year, the authority gives the city an average of $55 million from surplus funds, although this year the sum is about $151 million because of a special refinancing program, according to the authority.
 Mr. Doctoroff said that the state was releasing money from Battery Park reserve funds, enabling the city to use that money for the Javits Center. The city, however, would continue to receive an annual disbursement from the authority, he said. 
 City and state officials also portrayed the stadium as a critical element of the Javits expansion; they contend that the $1.4 billion stadium, with its retractable roof, would double as a 200,000-square-foot convention hall and possibly as an Olympic forum if the city wins its bid for the 2012 Games. The state and the city will each contribute $300 million to cover the cost of the retractable roof and a platform over the railyards on which the stadium would be built.
 The Javits expansion and the stadium are tied to a $3.7 billion plan to rezone the far West Side for residential and commercial development, to extend the subway and to create more parks. 
 Much of the opposition to the West Side projects has focused on the stadium, which even supporters regard as the Achilles' heel of the redevelopment plans. Critics say the connection to the Javits Center is rather tenuous and merely an attempt to make the stadium politically palatable.
 One opposition group held its own news conference a block away from the Javits Center in a basement meeting room next to a small park. It was the kind of place from which West Side residents battled successfully against the Westway highway project in the 1980's, Mortimer B. Zuckerman's plans for a tall tower at Columbus Circle and Donald J. Trump's proposal to build a wall of towers along the riverfront from 59th to 72nd Street.
 ''We're here to tell the mayor and the governor that this is our neighborhood and we do not want a stadium,'' said Christine Quinn, a member of the City Council and of the Hell's Kitchen/Hudson Yards Alliance. ''It's not a plan for our neighborhood; it's a plan for the Jets.'' Given the scarcity of public resources, she said the stadium was a bad public investment, likely to discourage investment and produce traffic congestion and pollution.
 The alliance comprises mainly elected officials from the West Side. But they have been joined by some potentially powerful allies, including Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, which operates 15 Broadway theaters and actively opposes the stadium, and executives from Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers. Cablevision, which opposes the stadium because of the potential competition for circuses, concerts, Ice Capades and other sports events, has also hired an environmental lawyer to look at the project. 
 Ms. Quinn vowed to take the fight to City Hall, Albany and ''the courts if necessary.''
 A second opposition group, the West Side Coalition, also vowed to fight the stadium as well as many other aspects of the redevelopment. ''Just because they have now announced the stadium for the umpteenth time, that does not make the financing real, nor ensure its success,'' said John Fisher, a spokesman for the coalition. ''The West Side is littered with many megaprojects that did not happen despite the hype of politicians, the press and corporations.''
 Aside from his critics, Mr. Doctoroff must still spend time dealing with the very people who say they support the stadium and the Javits Center expansion. The city failed to strike a deal with Peter S. Kalikow, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, over development rights for the use of the railyards in time for the Javits Center announcement. Mr. Kalikow, who was on vacation in Florida, did not attend.
 The hotel industry has also made it clear that it will be furious if the Pataki administration fails to get legislation passed in Albany this spring that would allow the Javits Center expansion to begin construction as quickly as the stadium. In the past, some hotel owners feared that the Javits Center would be left behind as the city pushed for the stadium.
 State and city officials had wanted the hotel industry to accept a $2-a-night surcharge. Hotel owners refused, saying it was prohibitive. That forced the city and the state to increase their respective contributions for the Javits Center at the last minute to $350 million, from $300 million. 
 One person who was particularly happy yesterday and got the loudest applause when he spoke at the news conference was Peter Ward, president of the Hotel Trades Council, a union. Mr. Ward cut a deal with the Jets just about ensuring that the permanent jobs at the stadium would go to union employees. 
 It was the price for his support.

HEADLINE: A Bush Spot Scrutinizes Kerry's Voting Record on the Economy

BYLINE: By Jim Rutenberg

 BODY:

This 30-second commercial began running in 18 states and on some cable networks yesterday.

PRODUCER -- Maverick Media.

ON THE SCREEN -- President Bush looks out onto the White House grounds, then walks along the White House colonnade. The screen splits between an image of Mr. Kerry speaking on television and a black backdrop with white lettering that says, ''Kerry economic record'' and ''$900 billion.'' The camera pulls back to show some two dozen smaller screens that it jumps among for the rest of the spot. One features images of two apparent retirees, one white, one black, and shows the words, ''Taxes on Social Security.'' A woman walks into a store in pre-dawn darkness and turns on the lights as the screen flashes, ''Opposed Tax Credits for Health Care.'' As a hand swipes a credit card into a gas pump payment system the screen flashes, ''Supported 50-cent/gallon tax hike.'' A man and a woman fill out a form as the screen flashes, ''Raise taxes.'' The spot closes with a smattering of TV screens, chief of among them one featuring Mr. Kerry, and two others stating, ''The First 100 Days'' and ''$900 billion.''

THE SCRIPT -- President Bush says, ''I'm George W. Bush and I approve this message.'' A male announcer says, ''John Kerry's economic record: Troubling. Kerry voted to increase taxes on Social Security benefits. And he voted against giving small businesses tax credits to buy health care for employees. Kerry even supported raising taxes on gasoline 50 cents a gallon. Now John Kerry's plan will raise taxes by at least $900 billion his first 100 days in office. And that's just his first 100 days.''

ACCURACY -- The vote to increase taxes on Social Security benefits was part of President Bill Clinton's 1993 budget deficit reduction package, which many economists credit with helping to spark a long expansion despite its unpopularity with many voters. Mr. Kerry did vote subsequently to continue those Social Security tax increases, but in May 2003 he supported a failed measure to repeal them. Mr. Kerry did vote against giving small businesses tax credits to buy health care for their employees in 2001. Mr. Kerry did vote for a similar tax credit in 2003 and has proposed another one in his health care plan. Mr. Kerry expressed support for a theoretical 50-cents-a-gallon gas tax in 1993, but he never moved to enact one. Lastly, the spot asserts that Mr. Kerry's ''plan'' would raise taxes by $900 billion over 10 years because his health care proposal is estimated to cost that much, and because he has vowed to reduce the deficit. Though Mr. Kerry has yet to detail how he would pay for his health care changes, he has not proposed a $900 billion tax increase.

SCORECARD -- Mr. Bush is trying to define Mr. Kerry as a high-taxing liberal while neutralizing criticism of his own handling of the economy. He seeks to show that Mr. Kerry has supported tax increases for the middle-class, not just the wealthy. Though some of the claims are dubious, the spot shows how Mr. Kerry's voting record can be used against him.

HEADLINE: Blair Visits Qaddafi, Ending Libya's Long Estrangement

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: LONDON, March 25 

 BODY:
With a handshake that was beamed round the world, Prime Minister Tony Blair officially ended Libya's three decades of isolation by greeting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi on Thursday in a tent near the capital, Tripoli, where they exchanged promises to fight the terrorism that Colonel Qaddafi once enthusiastically supported.
 Some relatives of those who died in 1988 in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, criticized Mr. Blair's journey. Libyan intelligence was blamed for that act and Libya admitted responsibility in September. It also agreed to pay $2.7 billion to the families of 270 victims, most of them American. 
 Michael Howard, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said it was a mistake for Mr. Blair to have traveled to Libya to greet Colonel Qaddafi immediately after the memorial service in Madrid on Wednesday for the victims of the March 11 terrorist attacks there, which killed 190 people -- not because Libya is suspected in the Madrid bombings, but because of Colonel Qaddafi's historic association with terrorism.
 But Mr. Blair defended his actions, saying he and President Bush were ''reaching out the hand of partnership today'' to reward Libya for its decision, announced Dec. 19, to surrender a 20-year accumulation of unconventional weapons, including an extensive effort aimed at making nuclear bombs.
 ''We are showing by our engagement with Libya today that it is possible for countries in the Arab world to work with the United States and the U.K. to defeat the common enemy of extremist fanatical terrorism driven by Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Blair said at a news conference. 
 The Libyan leader did not appear at the news conference, and he made no public comment beyond a few comments to Mr. Blair in English during their meeting in the tent. 
 ''You did a lot of fighting on this issue and seem exhausted,'' said the colonel, dressed in a robe, traditional hat and tinted glasses. The meeting was widely televised. 
 ''There's been a lot to do,'' Mr. Blair replied.
 Colonel Qaddafi, 62, complimented Mr. Blair, 50, saying: ''You are looking good. You are still young.''
 Afterward, Mr. Blair announced that the Shell oil group had won a $200 million contract, worth up to $1 billion in the long term, to explore for natural gas in Libya. He also said the British aerospace company, BAE Systems, was close to an agreement to provide civil aviation services; Libya's fleet of passenger jets is regarded as dilapidated and unsafe after years of sanctions and neglect. 
 Indeed, the wreckage of Libya's economy after 35 years of Colonel Qaddafi's rule is cited by many experts as the strongest motivation behind his decision to radically alter his national strategy.
 Mr. Blair, the first British prime minister to visit Libya since Churchill inspected British forces there during World War II, hailed Colonel Qaddafi's decision to end his weapons programs and rejected suggestions that he should feel ''queasy'' sitting down with a man who helped create the modern prototype of state-sponsored terrorism.
 ''Well, I've also sat down with people from Sinn Fein, as you know, because I thought it was important to do so in the context of peace in Northern Ireland,'' Mr. Blair said, referring to the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, whose campaign of terror in Britain was assisted for many years by Colonel Qaddafi's intelligence services.
 Still, Mr. Blair acknowledged that ''it was strange, given the history, to come here and do this.'' 
 While Mr. Blair seemed determined to make this trip an expression of good faith after months of secret talks last year that led to the December breakthrough, Mr. Bush is in no hurry to meet with the Libyan leader. But the White House continues to encourage him toward disarmament and resolution of the many legal cases that arose from Libya's terrorist past.
 American companies are also poised to return to Libya as soon as Congress lifts sanctions, a step that could be delayed by factors related to monitoring military programs and the demands of Lockerbie family members for a more detailed accounting of Libya's terrorist past. 
 On Thursday, Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, again praised the ''high degree of courage'' shown by Colonel Qaddafi in seeking better relations. But Mr. Howard, the opposition leader, scorned the notion, telling the BBC that to call the Libyan leader ''courageous for giving up murder and terrorism is really extraordinary.''
 Arab commentators were also harsh. Al Quds Al Arabi, an Arabic newspaper in London, said that while Libya was free to normalize its relations with the West, ''Libyan authorities have entirely turned their back on the Arabs, mocking them and denying their principles and history, as if restoring ties with America or Britain cannot happen except at the expense of the Arab world.''
 British officials also said they had made progress in the long-stalled investigation into the death of a young police officer, Yvonne Fletcher, who was killed in 1984 by a bullet that is believed to have been fired from inside the Libyan Embassy in London. British police detectives are to go to Tripoli on April 3 to interview possible Libyan witnesses who were working in the embassy at the time, police officials in London said.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Defeat An Effort to Limit Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
Facing heavy pressure from the Bush administration, House Republicans defeated attempts by Democrats on Thursday to block new tax cuts that would increase the nation's already swollen federal budget deficit.
 The action came before the House, in a surprisingly close vote of 215 to 212, approved a $2.4 trillion budget for next year. Lawmakers said the measure won enough votes for passage only after Republican leaders promised to schedule a vote by May on legislation that could place new restraints on future spending.
 Even with that guarantee, 10 Republicans still voted no. Some wanted less overall spending, some sought more money for veterans, and some argued that future tax cuts need to be restrained. ''It was an agglomeration of things,'' said Representative Mark Steven Kirk, Republican of Illinois. ''There was no unifying theme.'' 
 One Republican moderate, Michael N. Castle of Delaware, who favors adding restrictions on new tax cuts, complained that the budget ''does not address real reform, shared restraint and elimination of waste.''
 The vote sets up a showdown with the Senate, which has approved a requirement that any new tax cuts over the next five years must be passed by at least 60 votes in its 100-member chamber -- unless they are offset by increases in other taxes or spending cuts.
 House Republican leaders have indicated that they plan to kill the Senate's ''pay as you go'' provision when House and Senate lawmakers meet to reconcile differences between their budgets.
 ''I'd rather not have a budget resolution'' than one that restricts future tax cuts, said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 3 Republican in the House.
 Two Senate Republicans who favor restrictions on new tax cuts, John McCain of Arizona and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, said they would vote against the final budget if the provision was deleted.
 That could leave the fate of the budget in the hands of the two other moderate Republicans who voted for the provision: Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine. Neither has said how she would vote. 
 Ms. Collins said Thursday that she did not want to ''issue threats, but I do hope the final version will contain strong budget enforcement rules.''
 In an election year when the deficit has figured as a major political issue and President Bush has pushed to make permanent tax cuts that expire by the end of the decade, the most contentious budget debate on Capitol Hill is whether to reinstate the ''pay as you go'' rules that supporters credited with having sharply reduced the deficit in the 1990's. Such rules force money lost from tax cuts and spending increases to be made up elsewhere in the budget. 
 But that effort -- as it applies to taxes -- has met stiff resistance from the White House and Republican leaders in Congress, who acknowledge that the rules would make it very difficult to extend most of the Bush tax cuts.
 The White House budget director, Joshua B. Bolten, told House leaders this week that he was ''particularly pleased'' that their legislation ''does not include mechanisms that would encourage tax increases.''
 Mr. Bush and most Republicans say that the tax cuts had spurred the economy's rebound and that it would be foolish for Congress to limit its flexibility to pass new ones. 
 Republicans in the House Rules Committee blocked Democrats from even offering a ''pay as you go'' amendment, saying they never allow debate on individual amendments to budget resolutions, and on Thursday the House defeated several Democratic alternative budgets that included the language.
 ''If you want to keep the government growing, the tax burden rising, and jobs flowing overseas, you can find a Democratic budget alternative that is more to your liking,'' said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois.
 But Democrats said that without the discipline new budget rules would impose, Congress would not have the resolve needed to close to gap between spending and tax revenue that is expected to leave the nation with a $478 billion deficit this year. 
 ''They denied this House the opportunity to debate one of the most successful budget enforcement mechanisms we have at our disposal,'' said Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who has been leading efforts to impose new restrictions on tax cuts. ''We need to hold ourselves to the same budgeting standards that we hold every family in this country to.''
 The House passed its budget after Republicans defeated a series of Democratic alternatives that backers said would add money for education, veterans, environmental protection and other programs. 
 Like the Senate budget, the House version accommodates Mr. Bush's entire request for a 7 percent increase in discretionary Pentagon spending, to $402 billion.
 It also allows for the extension of three tax cuts that have bipartisan support: the elimination of the ''marriage penalty''; the expansion of the 10 percent tax bracket; and the maintenance of the child tax credit at $1,000 a year.
 In a nod to rising concern among Republicans about the deficit and spending levels, the House budget also contends that it will cut the deficit to $234 billion over five years -- more than the White House proposal -- while roughly freezing spending on discretionary programs aside from military and domestic-security demands. 
 But tight spending controls would make things difficult later this year, particularly on spending bills for veterans and education, said Representative C. W. Bill Young, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee.

HEADLINE: Kerry to Propose Eliminating a Tax Break on U.S. Companies' Overseas Profits

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
Responding to widespread anxiety about the movement of American jobs overseas, Senator John Kerry plans to propose on Friday a sweeping revision of international corporate taxes intended to prompt companies to invest more money in the United States.
 Aides said Mr. Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, would also challenge President Bush by saying his administration would spawn 10 million additional jobs over four years. Democrats often point out that more than two million jobs have been lost since Mr. Bush became president. 
 In a speech he is scheduled to deliver at Wayne State University in Detroit, a city that has been plagued by job losses in manufacturing, Mr. Kerry is to propose eliminating a major tax break on profits earned by American companies overseas and using that money to reduce the tax rate for all corporations. 
 ''You know, economic plans aren't just about dollars and decimals -- they're about choices,'' Mr. Kerry plans to say, according to excerpts of his prepared text provided by his campaign Thursday evening. ''Time after time, this administration has put ideology first and jobs last. Today, I'm announcing a new economic plan for America that will put jobs first.''
 With voters saying that the economy is still the most important issue in the election, Mr. Kerry's speech is designed to begin a new economic policy offensive. It represents an approach that sounds some of the same notes as his frequent denunciation of ''Benedict Arnold C.E.O.'s'' during the Democratic primaries, yet is more sympathetic to business.
 Kerry campaign officials said they hoped his proposal would appeal to people concerned about the loss of jobs to low-wage countries like China and India. But by advocating a crackdown on international companies but not an increase in the overall level of corporate taxes, the campaign is trying to avoid angering the business community.
 ''This is pure tax reform,'' said Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to Mr. Kerry who also served as a senior policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. ''He is eliminating tax incentives to move jobs overseas and using those funds to create incentives for new jobs and investment in the United States.''
 Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for President Bush's re-election campaign, denounced the proposals as ''window dressing'' and said that Mr. Bush supported a more comprehensive approach to job creation. 
 ''John Kerry's proposal does not make the kind of fundamental reform that will make U.S. firms more competitive in the global environment,'' Mr. Schmidt said, adding that Mr. Kerry was ''obstructionist'' on job-creating engines like opening foreign markets, reducing regulation and lowering taxes.
 On Thursday, Mr. Bush continued insisting that the economy was improving. ''So we've been through recession, an attack, corporate scandals and war,'' he said at New Hampshire Community Technical College in Nashua. ''And yet our economy is growing and getting stronger.''
 The essence of the Kerry plan boils down to two main elements.
 The first would be eliminating the ability of American multinational companies to defer taxes on their foreign profits as long as those profits stay outside the United States. That would raise about $12 billion a year in extra tax revenue, which Mr. Kerry would use to reduce the overall corporate tax rate to 33.25 percent from 35 percent.
 ''If a company is torn between creating jobs here or overseas, we now have a tax code that has American taxpayers paying to ship jobs overseas,'' Mr. Kerry plans to say in Friday's speech. ''That makes no sense. And if I am president, it will end.''
 Analysts on Wall Street have estimated that American companies have accumulated more than $400 billion in overseas profits, and multinationals are pushing for bills in Congress that would reduce taxes on foreign profits by as much as $37 billion over the next 10 years.
 ''The reason all that money is held overseas is because our international tax system does not prevent the double taxation of foreign source income,'' said John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization that represents the chief executives of large corporations.
 Many independent economists questioned Mr. Kerry's underlying assumption that the tax code plays a significant role in corporate decisions to set up factories overseas.
 ''My sense is that it is not usually the decisive factor,'' said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs. ''Normally, companies go offshore either because of cost reasons -- labor costs, materials costs -- or for market access reasons. Countries tell you that if you want to sell here, you need to be here.''
 Campaign officials acknowledged that the new plan would not stop the broader trend of outsourcing jobs to low-wage countries. But they said it would at least remove what they called a bias in the tax system that encourages such practices.
 To sweeten his proposal for business, Mr. Kerry also borrowed an idea supported by many Republicans. In addition to reducing the corporate tax rate, the plan would give American multinational companies a one-year ''tax holiday'' under which they could bring their accumulated foreign profits back to the United States at a tax rate of only 10 percent.
 Economic advisers to Mr. Kerry said the tax holiday would actually lead to a short-term windfall in tax revenues, because companies would have a special incentive to bring back hundreds of billions of dollars that have been sitting untaxed overseas.
 Under the plan, the government would use that windfall to pay for a two-year tax credit to companies that create new jobs.

HEADLINE: HUD Orders Nassau County To Repay Money for Grants

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., March 25 

 BODY:
Federal monitors have found numerous violations in Nassau County's use of grants, and are demanding that it correct procedures and repay nearly $1.2 million.
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development made the findings, which county officials released on Thursday. The inquiry was prompted by accusations of irregularities in Nassau's planning, housing and economic development agencies. In its review, HUD ordered the county to repay $865,489 spent on contracts that were not competitively bid, $196,280 for a housing program that violated federal rules, $47,557 for other ineligible items, $38,300 for undocumented expenses including travel, hotels and meals, and $6,000 for an unnamed county employee who had switched from full-time work to a three-day week at no cut in pay. 
 County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi, who had already ordered a number of corrective steps in the affected programs, said, ''We are generally supportive of the report's conclusions.'' He promised to ''take whatever remedial actions are necessary'' to satisfy the federal agency.
 The head of the troubled agencies, Peter T. Sylver, who was a deputy county executive, resigned under fire late last year. He has been accused of mismanagement, favoritism in hiring, billing inappropriate expenses to an illegally obtained county credit card and sexually harassing his executive assistant.
 The new report follows an internal review by Mr. Suozzi's staff, an audit by County Comptroller Howard Weitzman and legislative hearings, all of which found numerous problems during Mr. Sylver's tenure.
 Other investigations are still pending by the Nassau County district attorney's office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States attorney's office for Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island.
 Mr. Sylver has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, Stephen Worth, said he had not seen the HUD report and declined to comment on it.
 The federal report was hailed by the County Legislature's Republican minority, which for months has been attacking the Suozzi administration, which is Democratic, over Mr. Sylver's record.
 ''This validates that the waste, fraud and corruption has reached new highs,'' said the minority leader, Peter J. Schmitt. ''It's the tip of the iceberg, because there is more to come out. It's disgraceful, because these are programs for low- and moderate-income seniors and the handicapped, and it's all been squandered.'' Mr. Schmitt demanded that the county seek restitution of grant money from recipients.
 The HUD report said that its study had ''disclosed specific instances of noncompliance as well as systemic deficiencies.'' But it praised the county officials as cooperative, noted the corrective steps already taken and said ''we do not doubt'' the county's intentions. 
 The biggest nonbid contract cited was $250,000 for the Crowe Deegan law firm, whose members donated thousands of dollars to Mr. Suozzi's 2001 campaign.
 A total of $38,300 in bills was documented with receipts but no other explanation, the report said. ''We noted a large volume of expenses for travel, meals and sundry items that could not be clearly related to a program purpose,'' it added. 
 They included: $1,666 for hotels in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.; $136 at Tiffany & Company; $945 at a Hyatt hotel in Washington; $1,838 in airfares to Dallas; $793 at CompUSA; $620 at the Inn at Cooperstown, N.Y.; and $368 at Hoffman's Deli in Garden City. The smallest item: $1.42 at Gurney's Inn in Montauk.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Albany: Jobless Rate Falls Slightly

BYLINE: AP; Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
Unemployment fell in New York State between January and February, but the rate was still above the national average, the State Labor Department reported yesterday. Last month's unemployment rate was 6.3 percent in New York, compared with 6.6 percent in January and 6.3 percent in February 2003. 
Nationally, joblessness was at 5.6 percent in February, unchanged from January and down from 5.9 percent in February 2003. Though New York City's jobless rate of 8 percent last month dragged the state's employment numbers down, statisticians had some good news about the economy in the city. The number of private-sector jobs increased by a few hundred in February in the city, the first time that has happened on a year-to-year basis since the May 2000-May 2001 period.

Turmoil in Tyco Jury Room Seems to Put Case in Doubt
Turmoil in the jury room seemed to bring the Tyco International case to the verge of collapse, but rather than grant defense motions for a mistrial, the judge sent jurors home for the weekend and asked them to come back ready to try again on Monday morning.
 The jury's note to the judge earlier in the day, describing their deliberations as ''irreparably compromised,'' seemed to make it increasingly unlikely that the jury could continue debating the 32 criminal charges against Tyco's former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, and Tyco's former chief financial officer, Mark H. Swartz. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: U.S. and France Apparently at Odds Over Labor Rights

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS, March 26 

 BODY:
A squabble over whether to encourage the involvement of workers in corporate management has at least temporarily derailed, and could even kill, efforts of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to publish a comprehensive revision of its principles of corporate governance.
 The dispute, which appears to pit France against the United States, centers on whether the organization will endorse giving workers a role in corporate management, as they have by law in some European countries but do not have in the United States.
 It had appeared that the organization would remain neutral on that issue, but France has proposed adding language that says giving workers such roles should be ''encouraged.'' That has drawn the ire of business groups but has the strong support of trade unions. An official at the United States mission to the organization said on Friday that he had just learned of the dispute and said he was not sure how the organization would proceed. He declined to state the American position. 
 The O.E.C.D. is made up of 30 countries, most of them highly industrialized, and operates by consensus. As a result, any country that is strongly opposed to an initiative can block it.
 The organization has had principles of corporate governance since 1999 and announced plans in January to expand and enhance them. It had planned to announce the final version of those principles last week, but that announcement was canceled, ostensibly because of a scheduling conflict. The principles are scheduled to be adopted formally when ministers from the 30 countries meet in May.
 The principles are not binding in any country, but they have served as models for emerging countries seeking to establish rules for corporate governance. Unions hope, and some businesses fear, that if the organization were to support rights of workers to be involved in corporate governance, it would make it easier to establish and protect rules requiring such a role in both developed and developing countries.
 While specifics vary by country, many European countries give workers places on corporate boards or other bodies, and in some cases their participation has proved to be crucial. On Thursday, the chief executive of Infineon, the German semiconductor manufacturer, resigned after running afoul of some board members. The union that has representatives on the board said he had been criticized at a board meeting for both an ''overbearing leadership style'' and for ''rigorous outsourcing.''
 The organization's new rules do not mention workers as such but refer instead to ''stakeholders,'' a category that includes creditors as well as workers but is understood to refer to workers in the provisions under discussion.
 The existing principles state: ''Performance-enhancing mechanisms for employee participation should be permitted.'' In context, that means participation in corporate governance, and the plan had been to leave that sentence unchanged.
 John G. Evans, the general secretary of the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the organization, said that France had proposed changing the word ''permitted'' to ''encouraged'' and added that he understood that some other European countries agreed. He said he would have liked to see additional changes but supported the French proposal.
 Business leaders have encouraged countries to resist that change, saying that the very effort to make changes at this late date threatens the ability of the organization to complete work on the principles in a timely manner. They have called on the organization to remain neutral on the question of employee participation in corporate governance.
 ''It is not the role of the O.E.C.D. corporate governance principles to impose unique national mechanisms on other countries that have developed different but equally valid corporate governance systems,'' said Thomas R. Vant, the secretary general of the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the organization.
 Labor unions in some countries have hoped that the discrediting of corporate executives might work to their benefit. ''You almost need a new slogan,'' Mr. Evans told a conference on corporate governance at the French-American Foundation on Friday. ''Capitalists and workers unite in the struggle against managers.''
 The American official said he would wait to hear from the chairwoman of the organization's working group on the principles, Veronique Ingram, an official of the Australian treasury department, on what steps might be taken to reach consensus. The Australian mission said she was in Australia and could not be reached for comment.

SECTION: Section A; Column 6; National Desk; Pg. 1; THE CRASH ON I-95: OVERVIEW

LENGTH: 1207 words

HEADLINE: Bumper to Bumper, Travelers Ride Out An I-95 Nightmare

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN and ALISON LEIGH COWAN; Robert D. McFadden reported for this article from New York and Alison Leigh Cowan from Bridgeport. Avi Salzman, in Bridgeport, also contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., March 26 

 BODY:
Nearly two miles of Interstate 95, the main highway linking New York and Boston, will be closed for one to two weeks and require millions of dollars in repairs after a fiery truck crash Thursday night that buckled part of an overpass here, Gov. John G. Rowland said on Friday.
 As engineers surveyed melted and warped girders and the remnants of a rain of concrete at the site, detoured traffic in both directions backed up for miles on Bridgeport side streets and alternate routes, and thousands of commuters, truckers and other travelers faced long delays and weeks of disruption that was expected to have a major impact on the regions economy.
 About 120,000 vehicles a day pass over the span where the crash occurred, and its closure will force trucks carrying goods to and from Connecticut and the rest of New England to travel farther on alternate routes, including Interstate 84 or the Massachusetts Turnpike, officials said. Commuters to New York City and tourists heading for Connecticuts casinos, Mystic Seaport and other destinations also will be affected. 
 While there was no easy way to estimate the economic impact, trucking associations noted that delays in deliveries -- of everything from fish and frozen foods to clothing, medicine and furniture -- would add to their costs, and that more distant routes raised the costs of fuel and wages. For commuters, the options were extra hours on the road or a switch to trains. 
 ''It's going to be a pain in the neck,'' the governor said after inspecting the buckled overpass, where a truck carrying 12,000 gallons of heating oil veered to avoid a car, skidded 100 yards along a concrete barrier, burst into flames and burned for two hours. No one was seriously hurt, but fire officials said the southbound span sagged like a hammock as 30-inch beams glowed orange in 2,000-degree heat.
 Less than 17 hours after the Connecticut crash, a truck driver was killed when three tractor-trailers and a dump truck slammed together in a chain collision on the Goethals Bridge linking Staten Island and Elizabeth, N.J., the police said. Two other drivers were extricated from crumpled cabs and the bridge over the Arthur Kill was closed, causing huge tie-ups for hours on alternate routes. One of the trucks carried liquid oxygen, but there was no explosion and no leaks were reported. 
 Much of the Bridgeport police force was mobilized on Friday for traffic duty as cars and trucks invaded the city with fumes, noise and frustrated drivers caught in a stop-and-go, bumper-to-bumper nightmare. But state officials said it might have been worse; thousands of commuters heeded appeals to leave cars at home, they said, and many truckers followed warnings to take alternate routes.
 In the morning commute, the Metro-North railroad encountered no problems despite sharp passenger increases, said a spokesman, Dan Brucker. He said that express trains on the New Haven line and perhaps even Amtrak trains would be prepared to make extra stops to pick up commuters starting on Monday. Connecticut doubled its Shoreline East train service on Friday, state officials said, and ferry services added extra crossings from Bridgeport to and from Long Island. 
 Meantime, workers last night began demolishing the buckled southbound section of the overpass above Howard Avenue, and state and federal engineers were assaying how best to replace it. They were also trying to determine whether the northbound lanes, which appeared intact, could be salvaged. Structural testing of the steel was under way. 
 If the northbound lanes can be saved, the governor said, a prefabricated bridge will be used to replace the southbound side temporarily. But if both sides of the overpass must be torn down, the temporary bridge will be used to replace only the northbound lanes, and tons of landfill will be then used to span the southbound gap, with temporary new lanes built atop the fill.
 Arthur Gruhn, the chief engineer in the Connecticut Department of Transportation, said the northbound side would not be reopened until the middle of next week at the earliest, while the southbound lanes would not reopen for 7 to 14 days. Even if the northbound lanes were saved, he said, two-way traffic on them would not be feasible because of its enormous volume. Thus, much remained to be decided. 
 ''What we do know is the southbound side is shot,'' Governor Rowland said.
 Looking relaxed in a dark V-neck sweater and tan trousers, the governor, who went to Bridgeport after the accident Thursday night and was there most of Friday, pledged round-the-clock efforts to get the highway open again. He told reporters it was ''not just Connecticut's problem,'' given I-95's role as the main artery of the Northeast Corridor. ''This is a huge impact to the entire region,'' he said.
 After the collapse of a bridge over the Mianus River on I-95 in Greenwich on June 28, 1983, the highway was closed to cars for more than three weeks. It was reopened to large trucks that September. 
 Mr. Rowland, who declared a state of emergency and spoke to officials of the Federal Highway Administration, said he had secured a grant of $11.2 million to pay for repairs to the damaged highway, a cost he estimated at $3 million to $5 million, as well as millions in overtime costs for police officers and other workers. Any amount left over would be returned to Washington, he said.
 The governor told Mayor John Fabrizi of Bridgeport that his city would be reimbursed for expenses of handling traffic and other problems during the highway's closing. After inspecting the site from a state police helicopter, the mayor said: ''The impact is mainly now on police and fire overtime, cleaning up one of the waterways and a waste-treatment plant, and traffic through the local streets. Everything is going according to plan. We feel fortunate traffic is flowing.''
 Flowing was hardly the way Moh Halabi saw it. Mr. Halabi, a clerk at Layla's Market on Fairfield Avenue, leaned in the doorway of the bodega and watched a stream of detoured truckers squeeze and release brakes as they maneuvered through city streets instead of rolling down the highway. ''It used to be a quiet street,'' Mr. Halabi said. 
 I-95 car traffic in both directions was being diverted onto Bridgeport streets between Exits 25 and 27A. Southbound cars had the option of taking Route 25 north to the Merritt Parkway, five miles away, while southbound trucks were diverted on Route 25 and Route 8 north to Interstate 84, more than 20 miles to the north.
 The accident that led to the disruption occurred abut 7:45 p.m. Thursday when a southbound tanker truck owned by Island Transport of Connecticut and Long Island and driven by Gilbert Robinson, 33, of Naugatuck, Conn., veered to avoid a car driven by Sarah Waddle of Derby, Conn. The truck skidded along a concrete barrier, knocking down two light poles and spilling fuel and sparks for 100 yards.
 The wreckage burned so fiercely that steel beams under the overpass melted and the roadway buckled, falling several feet. Ms. Waddle was shaken but not injured, and Mr. Robinson was treated at Bridgeport Hospital and released, the police said. An unidentified Bridgeport firefighter was overcome by fumes and treated at the hospital.

HEADLINE: Confidence Unexpectedly Shows a Rise

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment has unexpectedly risen this month, suggesting that tax refunds and an accelerating economy are giving Americans reasons for optimism even as job growth lags. 
 The University of Michigan's final index of consumer sentiment for March rose to 95.8, from 94.4 in February. Economists had expected a final reading of 93.7 in the gauge, according to the median of 52 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The preliminary reading for March was 94.1. 
 Income tax rebates are up 5 percent on average from last year and forecasts call for the fastest pace of economic growth in two decades. That may be helping to buoy consumers until companies step up the pace of hiring. Declines in the stock market, a surge in gasoline prices and the March 11 terrorist attack in Madrid still weighed on attitudes. 
 ''We suspect that soaring tax refunds are offsetting the Madrid effect, as well as the impact of higher gas prices and the dip in stocks,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. Rising sentiment ''will help perceptions of the strength of the recovery.'' 
 A report from the Commerce Department yesterday said spending by consumers rose 0.2 percent in February, the fifth consecutive increase, after a 0.5 percent gain in January. Incomes rose 0.4 percent after a 0.3 percent rise in January. 
 The final Michigan index is based on a survey of about 500 households, double the sample size of the preliminary finding. 
 The survey's expectations index, which measures optimism about the next one to five months, rose to 88.8, from 88.5 a month earlier. 
 The current-conditions index, based on perceptions of consumers' financial situation and whether it is a good time to make major purchases, rose to 106.8, from 103.6 in February. 
 ''Assuming that the nascent job market recovery builds some momentum, and that the equity market does not continue to head south, these indicators ought to remain on a generally improving path,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. in New York. 
 The economy grew at an average annual pace of 6.1 percent in the final six months of 2003, and is forecast to expand 4.6 percent this year, the most since 1984, according to a Bloomberg News poll of economists.

HEADLINE: $6 Billion Loan Deal by Freddie Mac Examined by U.S.

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is examining an unusual $6 billion deal made last year by Freddie Mac to fulfill its federal requirements on loans for affordable housing.
 In the transaction, Freddie Mac agreed to guarantee and securitize, or turn into bonds, about 8,000 mortgages on small apartment buildings, loans made by Washington Mutual, the sixth-largest American bank. 
 Guaranteeing and securitizing loans is an important part of Freddie Mac's business. Like its larger corporate cousin, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored finance company created to encourage home ownership by lowering mortgage rates. Together, the two companies own or guarantee almost half of the home loans in the United States. Critics of Freddie and Fannie, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, say the companies have become too big and pose a risk to taxpayers because the federal government implicitly backs their debt. 
 In a typical deal, Freddie Mac takes loans from a bank or mortgage company and issues mortgage-backed securities whose interest payments it guarantees, even if the original borrowers default. In return, Freddie Mac takes a slice of the interest that is paid by the borrower.
 But in the big deal last year, Freddie Mac agreed to pay Washington Mutual $100 million for the right to guarantee and securitize the mortgages. Normally, Freddie and Fannie do not pay banks for the right to securitize loans, but for the loans themselves.
 ''This is a pretty unique transaction,'' said David Palombi, a spokesman for Freddie Mac.
 Washington Mutual disclosed in its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission for 2003 that it had the right to undo the deal, completed last October, without a penalty. In other words, if Washington Mutual decides that it wants the mortgages back for any reason, it can take them back. In its annual report, Washington Mutual said the mortgages remained on its books because it still controlled them.
 ''Since the company has the unilateral right to collapse the securities after one year, the company has effectively retained control over the loans,'' Washington Mutual said. ''Accordingly, the assets continue to be accounted for and reported as loans.''
 The report raises the question of what, if any, economic value Freddie Mac received in return for the $100 million it paid to Washington Mutual. But Freddie had another reason to buy the loans.
 Federal regulations require that Fannie and Freddie support affordable housing, and last year the Department of Housing and Urban Development specifically encouraged the companies to buy loans on apartment buildings with 5 to 50 units. Each housing unit in a building of that size counted for two units toward Freddie's affordable housing goal, according to Mr. Palombi.
 ''The transaction facilitated meeting the 2003 affordable housing goals,'' Mr. Palombi said. In all, Freddie bought about $22.6 billion in mortgages for multifamily homes and apartment buildings in 2003, according to Douglas Robinson, another Freddie spokesman.
 The Washington Mutual deal also gave Freddie Mac an entree into the market for mortgages for apartment buildings, which the company views as a business with strong potential, Mr. Palombi said. ''We've marked ourselves as a player in this market,'' he said.
 But the transaction has caught the attention of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. John C. Weicher, assistant secretary of the department, said in an e-mail message to a spokesman that he thought the deal was not typical.
 ''HUD is looking into the details of the WAMU transaction to ensure that housing units associated with the transaction are eligible for credit under HUD's regulation,'' Mr. Weicher said. (WAMU refers to Washington Mutual.) Mr. Weicher declined to comment on what parts of the deal his department was examining.
 Fannie Mae has not made such agreements, said Chuck Greener, a spokesman for Fannie Mae. ''We have not done a deal like this where we paid a fee to a lender to induce them to swap us loans for housing goal purposes,'' Mr. Greener responded in an e-mail message.
 The inquiry comes as Freddie Mac is working to restore its credibility with lawmakers and regulators after a difficult 2003. In the last nine months, Freddie has ousted its chief executive and has admitted that it hid about $5 billion in profits so that it could use those gains to bolster its earnings in the future.

HEADLINE: Shares Off a Bit on Profit Taking From Thursday Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The rally on Wall Street lost momentum amid profit taking yesterday, leaving stocks narrowly lower, but still allowing the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite index to post weekly gains for the first time since early March. 
 Investors were initially reassured by the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which rose to 95.8 in March, from 94.4 in February. The increase could mean consumers may be willing to spend more, bolstering the economy.
 A continued daily dose of strong economic reports and earnings could ignite the buying that Wall Street has been waiting for, Brian Belski, market strategist at Piper Jaffray, said. 
 ''The market looks like it wants to rally into earnings and throughout the earnings season, and we could be back to focusing on inherent fundamentals like earnings and valuation,'' Mr. Belski said. ''We're in a day-to-day, micro-reactive market that jumps on each little bit of news. If that news continues to be positive, we're in good shape.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,212.97, after a 170.59 point gain on Thursday.
 Broader stock indicators were also modestly lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,108.06, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.15 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,960.02. 
 For the week, the Dow climbed 26.37 points, or 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq rose 19.55 points, or 1.0 percent, while the S.&P. 500 lost 1.72 points, or 0.2 percent. 
 The Dow and Nasdaq halted a steep two-week decline, largely because of Thursday's gains, while the S.&P. 500 had its third consecutive losing week.
 The Commerce Department report on consumer income and spending, while not entirely positive, was still good enough to support the Michigan findings. Consumer income rose 0.4 percent in February, up from the 0.3 percent rise reported in January and slightly better than economists expected.
 However, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent, down from the 0.5 percent gain in January. While less than Wall Street expected, consumer spending still managed to make gains, analysts said, showing that the recent economic troubles have not deterred consumers. 
 The biggest coming indicator, however, is next week's payroll report for March, which analysts are hoping will be better than expected.
 ''If we get any kind of upside surprise in the jobs report, this market's really going to take off,'' Mr. Belski said.
 Until then, however, the stock markets will probably remain somewhat stagnant unless another major, unexpected world event occurs.
 ''The market is going to be a wait-and-see pattern until we get payroll and earnings,'' said Keith Keenan, vice president of institutional trading at Wall Street Access. 
 E*Trade Financial gained 40 cents, to $13.10, after the company was added to the S.&P. 500 index. The online brokerage and banking company was also upgraded to strong buy by Raymond James.
 Hewlett-Packard filed suit against a rival computer maker, Gateway, contending infringement of six patents covering a variety of personal computer technologies. Hewlett fell 3 cents, to $22.36, while Gateway dropped 14 cents, to $5.26.
 EchoStar Communications posted earnings that came in 8 cents a share below analysts' estimates, as well as lower-than-expected revenue. EchoStar slumped 94 cents, to $33.70.
 Treasury prices fell yesterday with the 10-year note declining 24/32, to a price of 101 12/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, jumped to 3.83 percent from 3.74 percent on Thursday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 15/32, to 109 8/32. The bond's yield rose to 4.77 percent, from 4.69 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Japanese Household Spending Rises for 4th Month in a Row

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 26 

 BODY:
Spending by Japanese households rose for a fourth consecutive month in February, the government said Friday, offering evidence that a recovery driven so far mostly by exports is beginning to catch on with consumers. 
 The strong figures were the latest of a string of upbeat reports about the economy. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks rose 2.08 percent, to its highest level in 21 months. 
 Average spending by households of wage earners, a closely watched measure of personal consumption, increased 6.9 percent in February from a year earlier, as Japanese spent more in restaurants and on cars. 
 ''This was clearly stronger than expected,'' said Ryo Hino, economist with J.P. Morgan in Tokyo. ''The trend, for the first quarter at least, is looking pretty good.''
 The government also reported that retail sales rose 0.9 percent in February from a year earlier, the second consecutive month of gains.
 Japan's economy has been through a number of false starts in recent years, with export-led recovery fizzing out because consumer spending failed to catch on. Just as in the United States, Japan's economic recovery has not yet generated the broad growth in jobs and incomes that might fuel a stronger rebound in consumption.
 Driven mostly by strong demand for Japanese products in the United States, Europe and Asia, the Japanese economy grew at a 6.4 percent annual pace in the last quarter of 2003, its best performance since the collapse of the land and stock bubble in the early 1990's. And with corporate profits rising, the threat of layoffs is subsiding and consumers say they are less worried than they once were about the economy.
 ''I think it's definitely getting better,'' said Kotomi Yokoyama, 35. Ms. Yokoyama said that her husband, who works for a real estate company, was earning more than ever so they were spending more on tutors for their two children, hoping to improve their chances of getting into good schools.
 Over all, however, salaries are still falling as manufacturers remain under pressure to cut costs to compete with producers in China. And while the rising stock market has increased household wealth somewhat, those gains have been more than offset by a drop in real estate prices that has eroded home values.
 ''There is a certain core of improvement that the reports are revealing,'' said Jeffrey Young, an economist with Nikko Citigroup. But he warned that ''there are still strong headwinds for the household sector.''
 ''We're more than two years into the economic cycle and incomes have not risen yet,'' he added.
 Another note of caution in the data came from the fact that about half of the rise in spending resulted from February 2004 being a day longer than February 2003.
 Still, even after adjusting for the leap-year effect, the spending number was encouraging, many economists said.
 The figures released Friday also showed that Japan continued to struggle with deflation. The nationwide consumer price index was flat in February from a year earlier, the government reported, while the price index for the Tokyo area fell 0.1 percent in March from a year ago, extending the string of declines in that number to four and a half years.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Hong Kong: Exports Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
Hong Kong exports rose more than 12 percent in the first two months of the year, as exports to the United States increased after declining in several previous quarters. Economists measured the first two months together because the Lunar New Year holiday occurred in January this year but in February last year, distorting monthly comparisons. ''There was sustained double-digit growth in exports to both the East Asian markets and the European Union,'' a government spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Above All, Money Matters Are What Matter to Poles

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

DATELINE: WARSAW, March 25 

 BODY:
Poles are more than aware that this is a dizzying moment. Just a month before they shuck off the last traces of their Communist past by joining the European Union, their government is collapsing and they worry that, like Spain, their friendship with the United States may provoke a terror attack against them.
 Yet there are no big demonstrations against -- or for -- the war in Iraq. There is little public outcry against -- and certainly not for -- Leszek Miller, the nearly finished prime minister. There is not even much jubilation that Poland will enter the European Union as the biggest and most influential of the 10 new nations in the club. 
 Instead, for the moment, Poles seem quietly dug in, waiting with anticipation -- and a touch of their inborn conservative pessimism -- to see just what all this change brings.
 ''Nothing has really happened so far,'' said Piotr Bartosz, 34, owner of a small electronics shop in a run-down market here in the capital. Things are moving around but it hasn't touched us yet.''
 A recent rebound in a long-stifled economy, combined with fears that the European Union will actually make life harder in the short term, have left people focused on their pocketbooks -- with little left over, experts say, for larger issues like Mr. Miller's fall or Iraq.
 ''Life centers around the economy, around wages, around what they can or cannot buy with their money, and they can buy more and more,'' said Zbigniew Lewicki, professor of American studies at Warsaw University.
 ''The government is so alienated from the public,'' he added, ''people don't pay much attention to it.''
 Unemployment, which has hit a record high of nearly 21 percent, is one major reason for the decline of Mr. Miller, who look office in 2001. Today his popularity stands at just about 10 percent.
 More devastating, perhaps, are the corruption scandals that eroded his credibility -- a fact he acknowledged in an interview this week when he spoke vaguely of ''various crimes'' attributed to party members ''especially on the local level.''
 ''This is simply sort of a label that was glued to us,'' he said. ''And it has to bring about negative responses.''
 Many members of his own party have been more blunt about where they believe blame lies, as they announced this week that they would form a new party without Mr. Miller. 
 ''Leszek Miller has lost society's trust and most certainly has to leave,'' Marek Borowski, the Parliament speaker, told reporters this week. 
 [On Friday, Mr. Miller announced his resignation, effective May 2, the day after Poland officially joins the European Union.]
 Unlike in Spain, however, the war in Iraq did not seem to contribute to Mr. Miller's fall, though Poland has deep reservations about it. Opinion surveys show that, as in Spain, most Poles oppose having troops in Iraq, and fear has spiked since the bombings in Madrid this month that terrorists may single out Poland as one of America's closest allies. It has one of the largest allied contingents in Iraq, with 2,500 troops there.
 ''I think it's putting people in danger unnecessarily,'' said Jan Wieczorek, 54, a grocer in the Warsaw market.
 Poles are also upset that the United States has not reciprocated their support by allowing them to travel to America without visas, and they feel ''misled,'' as President Alexander Kwasniewski said last week, that unconventional weapons have not been found in Iraq.
 But the nation remains deeply warm to the United States, and Poland will still enter the European Union as one of its most pro-American members, changing the European mix even as Poland itself is changed. Already the little market where Mr. Bartosz and Mr. Wieczorek work is one symbol of both the worry and the hope that Poles see in joining the European club.
 Huge foreign supermarkets with low prices have cut business in this market, which has provided the neighborhood meat, vegetables, sweets and clothes for at least 30 years.
 The market was never pretty, built with rusty tin siding, but it has looked especially shabby since the fancy modern building of a computer and mobile phone company opened across the street. Shopkeepers have agreed to spruce the market up.
 Teresa Lendzion, 28, whose husband's family sells a dozen varieties of apples and pears there, said they had felt the crunch of low supermarket prices. She fears the European Union will bring more big foreign stores.
 Still, she said, joining is the right way ahead, even if, like most Poles, she does not seem to see this as a moment to celebrate.
 ''I think we have chances,'' she said tentatively. ''I think there are possibilities, especially for young people. The borders will open and they can go work somewhere.''

HEADLINE: Economy Is the Star of the Campaign Trail as Bush and Kerry Court Voters

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN and ROBERT PEAR; Jodi Wilgoren reported from Warren for this article and Robert Pear from Phoenix.

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich., March 26 

 BODY:
The presidential race turned squarely to the economy on Friday, as Senator John Kerry courted this hard-hit state with a promise of new jobs, while President Bush promoted his tax cuts as an engine for growth.
 After several weeks of being portrayed as a tax-and-spend liberal in advertisements by the Bush campaign, Mr. Kerry used his first major policy address of the general election battle to position himself as a moderate New Democrat on fiscal policy. He proposed an overhaul of corporate taxes that would provide a 5 percent reduction in the corporate tax rate for most companies. 
 Mr. Bush, after days of focus in Washington on his administration's response to terrorism, spent the day defending his economic record after a period of recession and extolling homeownership as he traveled in the fast-growing states of Arizona and New Mexico.
 For Mr. Kerry, it was a critical moment of self-definition on the economy, which many political strategists see as the top issue in the unfolding campaign. He plans to outline a variety of economic proposals in a spring offensive under the new banner ''Jobs First.''
 ''Under this president, more and more of our people have begun to lose confidence in our economy,'' Mr. Kerry said in a speech at Wayne State University in Detroit, ticking off dire statistics about unemployment and poverty over the past three years. ''Instead of giving us an economy that creates jobs and opportunity, our present leadership has given us wedge issues designed to divide Americans. Instead of a real economic plan, they have given us the old politics of negative attacks.''
 But Mr. Bush used his visit to the Southwest to highlight the record levels of homeownership there and across the country, arguing that his tax cuts had spurred the economy by increasing demand.
 ''This economy is strong, and it's getting stronger,'' Mr. Bush told an audience of several hundred at the sun-splashed courtyard at the state fairgrounds in Albuquerque. Later, speaking to members of the carpenters' union in Phoenix, he said, ''The most important issue for me is jobs.'' The parallel campaign swings two time zones apart were part of a debate over the economy that will play out across the campaign year. Mr. Kerry plans two more major speeches on the economy in the coming weeks, each intended to back up his promise to create 10 million new jobs in his first term, if elected.
 Mr. Kerry brought out members of the Clinton administration to pitch his plan on Friday, hoping people will link his campaign to the thriving 1990's economy. Roger Altman, Mr. Clinton's deputy treasury secretary, held a conference call with reporters, while Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's top economic adviser, traveled with the campaign and did the rounds on television.
 ''It is completely achievable for the United States to return to a path of creating 10 million jobs in four years,'' Mr. Sperling told reporters flying with Mr. Kerry from Washington to Detroit, noting that the Clinton administration added 11 million jobs in its first term. The corporate tax overhaul Mr. Kerry announced Friday would end provisions in the tax code that allow American companies to take tax deferments on profits earned overseas. That is expected to yield about $11 billion annually.
 To encourage companies to bring back the $600 billion invested abroad, Mr. Kerry would provide a one-year haven in which those profits would be taxed at 10 percent rather than the full rate. Mr. Sperling said he thought that would bring a one-time windfall of $10 billion to $20 billion.
 Mr. Sperling said just 6,000 companies, or less than 1 percent of the total, have foreign operations and would be affected by those changes. For the rest, Mr. Kerry is promising a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 33.25 percent from 35 percent, and a tax credit exempting them from payroll taxes on any new jobs created over two years.
 ''Some may be surprised to hear a Democrat calling for lower corporate tax rates,'' Mr. Kerry said at Wayne State before heading to this suburb for a rally with auto workers. ''The fact is, I don't care about the old debates. I care about getting the job done and creating jobs here in the United States of America.''
 Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, scoffed at the tax plan proposed by Mr. Kerry.''Reshuffling of the tax code, while increasing taxes on small businesses and entrepreneurs, does nothing to create an environment for sustained economic growth and job creation,'' Mr. McClellan told reporters traveling with the president.
 In appearances in New Mexico and Arizona, two swing states, President Bush tried to deflect criticism from Mr. Kerry and other Democrats that the administration had been passive as companies shifted tens of thousands of American jobs to other countries. He called for permanent extension of his tax cuts and a reduction in government regulations and paperwork.
 ''The best way to make sure people can find work in America is to make sure the business environment, the entrepreneurial environment is strong and solid,'' Mr. Bush said. ''If you want to keep jobs here in America, we need less paperwork.''
 Mr. Bush said he would push to make high-speed Internet service available in all parts of the country by 2007, and said consumers should have ''plenty of choices when it comes to purchasing the broadband carrier.'' He added, ''Congress must not tax access to broadband technology if we want to spread it around.'' 
 He also criticized Democrats for trade policies he portrayed as protectionist. ''Instead of walling each other off, like the economic isolationists want us to do,'' he said, Americans should have confidence in their ability to compete in world markets. ''Economic isolationism will lead to economic stagnation,'' he declared.
 Aware of these accusations, which Mr. Bush has made several times since Mr. Kerry became his party's presumptive nominee, Mr. Kerry insisted in his Detroit speech, ''I am not a protectionist, but I am a competitor,'' saying he would modify trade agreements to require worker and environmental protections.
 The Kerry campaign also entered the debate over Mr. Bush's jokes on Wednesday night at a dinner with journalists in Washington, where he showed slides of himself searching under his desk, among other places for weapons of mass destruction.
 ''If George Bush thinks his deceptive rationale for going to war is a laughing matter, then he's even more out of touch than we thought,'' the campaign said in a statement on its Web site. The White House has said Mr. Bush was not making light of the war in Iraq, but was engaging in self-deprecating humor as is the custom at such dinners.

LENGTH: 602 words

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, No Solutions So Far for Jammed Roadways

BYLINE: By PAUL von ZIELBAUER

 BODY:
The chaos created by a fuel-truck crash Thursday night in Bridgeport underscored how much must still be done -- and how little, relatively speaking, has been accomplished -- to relieve what experts say is an interstate highway system in crisis in southwestern Connecticut. 
 The problem facing elected officials, local residents and regional transportation planners is daunting: how do you reduce congestion on an aging highway in the heart of the state's most crowded, affluent and economically important region without crippling the residents, governments and companies that depend on it? 
 In a region where Interstate 95 already cuts through several crowded downtowns and connects to hundreds of suburban feeder roads, expanding major sections of the highway is virtually impossible, traffic experts say. 
 Though more lanes are being built in some sections, including the snaking bottleneck in Bridgeport where the truck accident occurred on Thursday, ''it seems pretty implausible'' to expand the entire interstate, said Robert Wilson, the executive director of the South Western Regional Planning Agency, a nonprofit group based in Stamford. 
 ''There's not enough money for the system now,'' he said, ''not to mention for an additional roadway that no one would want anyway.''
 Enlarging the busiest portion of Interstate 95 in Connecticut, between Greenwich and New Haven, has been mentioned by state transportation officials in the past, but the idea quickly -- and appropriately -- died, said Carmine Trotta, a manager for the Connecticut Department of Transportation. 
 ''The area is developed so much, and the cost would be so extensive, and the environmental impact would be so great that we essentially abandoned the idea,'' he said in an interview Friday. 
 Moreover, Mr. Trotta said, ''the cost would be billions.''
 More recently, during a meeting of the state Transportation Strategy Board, a group of business leaders and state commissioners, someone suggested ''seriously exploring double-decking I-95,'' Mr. Wilson said. That idea, too, was promptly discarded. 
 Thus, for a number of geographic, historical and lifestyle reasons, plowing into a daily crawl on Interstate 95 to and from work is the only real option for thousands of daily commuters who shun the region's under-funded and often inconvenient public transportation options. 
 ''It's a geographic issue,'' said Mr. Wilson, of the South Western Regional Planning Agencv, because the state Capitol is in Hartford, where too many lawmakers ''don't recognize rail as an option, because in that part of the state there are no commuter railroads.'' 
 Many state officials acknowledge that the state's commuter train line -- Connecticut owns the railroad tracks and some 350 train cars on the New Haven line of Metro-North -- is prone to frustrating delays and breakdowns, and that the current level of service is no way to lure commuters off highways.
 For many commuters, the only alternative to using Interstate 95 to get to and from work is the Merritt Parkway, which runs roughly parallel to Route I-95 from Greenwich to Stratford and is off limits to large trucks. 
 Expanding the Merritt's capacity, however, is also out of the question. In 1991, the roadway, built mostly in the 1920's and 1930's, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Replacing even the road's wooden guard rails requires approval from federal preservationists. 
 ''There is little support for widening that roadway,'' Mr. Trotta said, although, unlike Interstate 95, ''there is enough property to do so.''

HEADLINE: The West Side's Yours, Ground Zero Mine

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
It is not exactly a municipal version of Yalta. But through a deal made for two politicians with pressing political needs, shared electoral constituencies and eyes on the history books, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg have each carved out a piece of Manhattan on which to fasten their economic development visions, with one another's blessing. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has laid claim to the development of the far West Side. Mr. Pataki wants credit for the rebirth of Lower Manhattan. 
 The deal holds the opportunity for each man to secure a lasting political legacy involving some of the most prestigious and valuable real estate in the world, in a city that favors largeness and vision. 
 The deal became slightly more overt this week when Mr. Bloomberg served as master of ceremonies to announce plans to greatly expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and build a 75,000-seat stadium. 
 ''It is a fair to say that the governor has taken more of a lead on the World Trade Center site,'' said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. ''And the mayor has taken more of a lead'' with the nuts and bolts of developing the far West Side, he said. 
 Since before he ran for mayor, Mr. Bloomberg has been a proponent of creating housing and office space and generally revitalizing one of the last remaining corridors of Manhattan that development has forgotten, the neighborhood in the West 30's, from Ninth Avenue to the Hudson River. He has said on multiple occasions that he believes improving the Javits center will bring about all of that, while creating jobs and stimulating tourism.
 Governor Pataki, according to people who have worked closely with the governor on the issue, is focused on Lower Manhattan, specifically the site of the fallen World Trade Center, which he believes will bring international attention to the city, and by proxy, himself. He also is said to feel that he has been the continuous governmental link in the city since the terrorist attack of 2001, and has said on many occasions that the site -- along with the memory of the day -- has profound personal meaning for him. 
 While the two have not actually taken out a map and divided up the city with tiny push pins, their staffs have come to an agreement that each will do much of the work -- and, their aides hope, get the credit -- for their area of interest, said several people involved in both projects. 
 At a meeting last month between Mr. Pataki and several of his senior aides, Mr. Pataki said, ''I've made a deal with the mayor to support him on the West Side,'' according to an aide who attended the meeting. Part of that deal, the aide said, was that Mr. Bloomberg would give the governor a free hand in Lower Manhattan, which he has largely done since the earliest plans were discussed. 
 According to the aide in the meeting, Mr. Pataki urged his staff members -- some of whom were reluctant to get on board with the stadium plan for myriad complex reasons -- to get united behind the West Side projects. 
 And though both men attended the announcement of the stadium and Javits plans this week, it was Mr. Bloomberg who served as host. Mr. Pataki played the central role earlier this year to announce the plans for the memorial to World Trade Center victims in Lower Manhattan. 
 While Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Pataki are far from close friends -- they have clashed over everything from taxes to federal aid to the city -- they have put their differences behind them for mutual benefit to their own legacy projects. ''I think they really see each other as partners,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, a notion echoed by three aides to the governor.
 Sometimes, that can simply mean staying out of each other's way. Other times, it means lending significant material support and showing a public face of unity. In terms of developing the West Side, the state had to commit to significant financing, and expanding the Javits center requires state legislation, which the governor has already said he will support. 
 Stretching out the No. 7 train line to the far West Side, which is far from a fait accompli, and building on the Long Island Rail Road yards there require the acquiescence of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, an agency controlled by the governor. At the mayor's behest, Mr. Pataki also has freed up his chief economic development official, Charles A. Gargano, to help get things moving. 
 Mr. Pataki has spent far more time in meetings with the various interests in the Lower Manhattan site than Mr. Bloomberg, and he devotes far more of his speeches and other public remarks to discussing Lower Manhattan than the mayor.
 The mayor has helped the governor in small but significant ways, appointing minorities and women to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, deflecting criticism building against the governor that the board was too white and male.
 For several months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Pataki was largely in the shadow of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. But after Mr. Bloomberg took office, Mr. Pataki easily found a way to become front and center in the rebuilding process. The board charged with leading rebuilding -- the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation -- is an adjunct of the state, controlled by Mr. Pataki. 
 Further, he has been much more successful than the mayor at getting along with the more outspoken family members of those killed in the attack than Mr. Bloomberg, who has at times antagonized them. 
 Even in his remarks during this week's news conference, Mr. Pataki took pains to mention Lower Manhattan, too. 
 ''The governor considers it both an honor and an obligation to rebuild Lower Manhattan in honor of those we lost during the greatest attack on American soil,'' said Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for the governor.Mr. Bloomberg's interest in the far West Side dates back to his involvement in luring the Olympics to the city. He was a board member and contributor to NY2012, Mr. Doctoroff's organization created to bring the Olympic Games to New York, and spoke about the issue during the mayoral campaign.Mr. Bloomberg has mentioned the convention center expansion idea in all three of his state of the city speeches. 
 Edward Skyler, the mayor's spokesman, said, ''There's no doubt that he has the longest personal involvement in the far West Side and that the transformation of this neglected area is going to be the backbone of the city's economic growth in the 21st century.''

HEADLINE: Rumbling Through History

BYLINE: By SARAH SLOBIN

 BODY:
By 1850 the island of Manhattan was bottom-heavy. People were packed into its southern tip, and a population explosion was adding wave upon wave of immigrants. The city needed new transit networks to ease crowds on its clogged streets and to expand into open land to the north and south. Subways won out over elevated trains, and New Yorkers have been riding in a hole in the ground ever since. Here are some of the high points and low of a system riders love, hate and depend on every day. SARAH SLOBIN

On the first day of a strike by the BRT motormen, a dispatcher, who was filling in, was handed the controls after only two hours of training. At the end of his shift he was asked to run the Brighton Beach line, known for its sharp turns. His speeding train jumped the track on an S-curve on what is now the Franklin Avenue shuttle line. At least 97 people died
more than 250 were hurt. Malbone Street was renamed Empire Boulevard shortly afterward.1921 -- The Giants play the Yankees at the Polo Grounds in the first Subway Series.

Hylan wins approval for a city-owned system almost entirely underground that will eliminate the els and add 59 miles of service.1932 -- The city's Board of Transportation wraps up construction of the Eighth Avenue line and opens the Independent Rapid Transit Railroad, the first city-owned and operated subway. It would be completed in 1940.1940 -- The city buys the BMT (formerly the BRT) and IRT and combines them with the IND to become the sole owner and operator of all New York subway and elevated lines.1941 -- Miss Subways contest begins.1947 -- The R-10 cars, a new generation, are designed as an altered version of the 1938 R-7 car.

Tammany Hall collected tribute from streetcars, and Boss Tweed was an el fan. This didn't stop Alfred Ely Beach, an inventor and publisher, from trying to outwit the powers that be. In 1870 he unveiled his ''pneumatic subway,'' an underground tube secretly constructed under lower Broadway in the guise of building a mail system. The tunnel was 312 feet long and 9 feet wide, and the waiting room had a grand piano and a goldfish tank. The train was blown end to end by a giant fan system, and the public loved it. Though Beach fought to expand it, Tammany Hall thwarted him at every turn. With the Panic of 1873, money dried up, and the subway, at least as Beach envisioned it, closed after four years. In 1912 subway workers would stumble across the tunnel.(pg. 8)Chart: ''Urban Flight, Urban Blight''After World War II the suburbs drew people out of New York. As the city's economy soured, crime and grit became a mainstay of the subway experience.1953 -- The state creates the New York City Transit Authority, an independent body, to oversee operations. The Transit Authority commandeers the money to repair the dilapidated system.

Lindsay's administration, and drags on until Jan. 13. The union leader Mike Quill, ailing after his second heart attack, is jailed along with his colleagues. Thousands of workers protest in the streets. In the end the union wins pay increases, paid holidays and better pensions. Mr. Quill dies 15 days later.1967 -- Air-conditioned cars are tested. Happily, they work.1968 -- The state creates the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as the Transit Authority's parent agency.1970 -- Graffiti begins to appear.1976 -- Miss Subways disappears after opposition by feminist groups.1979 -- Curtis Sliwa founds the Guardian Angels as the Magnificent Thirteen Subway Safety Patrol.1980 -- A strike shuts the system for 11 days.1982 -- A series of five-year capital plans begins under Richard Ravitch, chairman of the M.T.A.

HEADLINE: Bumps Along the Rails

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
AS you ride the A train or the 2 train or any other line on the New York subway, you may want to mull an essential but mostly forgotten fact, one that could be posted aboard every train as a civics lesson. 
 It is this: Many of the lines exist because eight decades ago, a mayor and a newspaper publisher despised the existing transit companies. The city built those lines not to complement the older ones, but to compete with them -- in fact, to bankrupt them. It worked, which is why New Yorkers ended up with overlapping transit service in some areas, and no service in others. 
 While the subway is rightly praised as the life force of the city, it is equally true that its past and present have been shadowed by politics, rivalries, grudges, accidents, demagoguery and decisions that were just plain dumb.
 Most squabbles were about money, and they go a long way toward explaining the subway's central failing: wide swaths of the city have no service. With a few small exceptions, the system has not been expanded since 1941; the demolition of elevated lines means the city has less transit rail service now than it had then.
 ''If you go to any of the major European systems, or Tokyo or Seoul, historically, they have not just kept the system in good order, they have expanded it to keep pace with the city's growth,'' said Peter Derrick, a historian and the author of ''Tunneling to the Future: The Story of the Great Subway Expansion That Saved New York'' (New York University Press, 2001). ''What sets New York apart is the failure to do that, the failure at times to even keep it in good order, the inability to come to terms with who will pay for things over the long run.''
 More than any of the systems abroad, he added, New York's is expected to pay for itself through passenger fares, rather than government investment.
 The dark side of the subways predates the system itself. Construction of the first tunnel was delayed by more than a decade -- Boston beat New York to it as a result -- by disputes over what would get built, by whom, where and with whose money.
 ''Transit is political,'' said Gene Russianoff, who, as staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, has spent more than two decades lobbying public officials for money. ''It's been as bare-knuckles as any aspect of life in New York, going back to Boss Tweed.''
 The original subway planners also became combatants in one of the defining economic struggles of the industrial age, over the future of a new commodity, electricity. Thomas Edison championed direct current electricity, while George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla promoted alternating current, and they battled for years to win adherents. 
 The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, the IRT, sided with Edison, a mistake that New Yorkers are still paying for. Within a few years, alternating current became the world's standard. So to this day the subway system buys power from the grid, available only as alternating current, and must convert it to direct current before pumping it into the third rail. 
 Early business and political rivalries led to another fundamental blunder. The subway today remains two separate systems -- the numbered lines in one, the lettered lines in the other -- whose trains, tunnels and platforms are incompatible.
 But it is money, or its lack, that has shaped the system for much of the last century. The system lives in a constant state of tension among three sets of expenses: daily operations, regular replacement of old equipment, and expansion. The debates over balancing these expenses, involving fare increases and government subsidies, often become political brawls. 
 In the late 19th century, the fare on the elevated and street-level trains that plied the city was a nickel. When the subway came along, the fare was a nickel, too. And for decades after, through wars and inflation, the political leaders who controlled the fare refused to raise it.
 By the end of World War I, the city's two transit rail companies, the IRT and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, were losing money and seeking a fare increase, and the BRT entered bankruptcy, emerging a few years later as the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Company, or BMT. Yet the city's populist mayor, John F. (Red Mike) Hylan, rebuked ''grasping transportation monopolies'' and defended the nickel fare as a birthright. Mr. Hylan's principal backer, William Randolph Hearst, blared this view from his newspapers. (They were less than impartial. Decades earlier, the BRT's forerunner had fired Hylan from his job as a train engineer; Hearst saw attacks on the transit companies as a good way to sell papers.) 
 Hylan called for a new, city-owned system to be named the Independent, or IND, which is the origin of many of today's lettered lines. Rather than push the system into fresh terrain that needed service, like eastern Queens, he placed lines where they would compete with the IRT and BMT.
 By World War II, both of the older companies had collapsed and the city had taken them over and merged the three systems. But city control was no panacea, especially with the fare still a nickel. The first fare increase, to a dime, did not occur until 1948, 44 years after the subway opened. By then, the country was in thrall to the automobile, and investment in mass transit dwindled. Basic maintenance was neglected; ridership and revenues plummeted, and transit strikes in 1966 and 1980 did not help matters. Anyone who lived in the city in the early 80's remembers when the subways meant derailments, fires, graffiti and crime.
 New York State came to the rescue with billions of dollars starting in 1982, but in the last decade the state and the city have retreated from capital spending. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has an ambitious list of projects under way, including work for the long-delayed Second Avenue subway, but the agency's heavy reliance on borrowing, in the absence of government aid, has some financial watchdogs worried. 
 Politicians have always promised new service that nobody could or would finance. Both the 1913 plan that greatly expanded the system, and Hylan's 1922 IND initiative, were never completely realized. But the Second Avenue subway reigns as an icon of noncompletion, like the Cathedral of St. John the Divine or Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington. Voters approved bonds for it in 1951, and demolition of the Third Avenue el in Manhattan a few years later was justified partly by arguing that a Second Avenue line was imminent. New York City Transit spends millions of dollars each year just to maintain the unused bits of tunnel it has dug.
 So what will become of the Second Avenue line? Mr. Russianoff, 50, replies with a question of his own: ''In my lifetime? Depends on the politicians.''

HEADLINE: Georgians Anxiously Watch New Leader

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, March 22 

 BODY:
It is democracy in a china shop aggressive televised arrests, new limitations on the press, a rushed constitutional amendment to concentrate presidential power, a headlong confrontation with a rebellious local strongman.
Two months into his term, Georgia's new democratically elected president, Mikhail Saakashvili, is bulling ahead with all the energy that drove out his predecessor, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in a popular uprising in November. 
 His supporters in the United States and Europe, who are heavily financing his government and have a stake in its success, are crossing their fingers that he will not push things too far. Human rights groups have begun to warn of a tendency toward one-man rule. 
 A highly intelligent and self-confident American-trained lawyer, Mr. Saakashvili, 36, had been known as something of a rabble rouser when he was in the opposition. Many people say he is just the man Georgia needs to shake this broken nation back to life.
 The corrupt mafia chieftains who control much of the economy must quickly learn who is boss, the government must pull itself together and start providing services, taxes must be collected, salaries and pensions must be paid, foreign investment must grow.
 Political analysts say Mr. Saakashvili may have a six-month window of time before the momentum for change slows and before Georgia loses the attention of foreign donors, including both governments and private organizations, notably the Open Society Institute founded by the billionaire George Soros. 
 ''We must move swiftly to take advantage of political support,'' Mr. Saakashvili said a month ago during a visit to Washington, where he met with President Bush and won promises of support. 
 The United States is heavily invested in Georgia because of its strategic location on Russia's southern border and because of a major oil pipeline that crosses its territory and is scheduled to open next year.
 A growing number of critics, though, say that the new president is exploiting his popularity to cut legal corners, violate human rights and silence opposition views, and that Georgia could find itself back in the hands of an autocratic leader. It is unlikely that a new Parliament, to be elected Sunday, will rein in his power. Opposition parties are so broken and demoralized that they may be shut out of the legislature altogether.
 The constitutional amendment, pushed through an obedient Parliament with little public discussion, has created a superpresidential system similar to that in today's Russia, where the chief executive dominates all branches of power.
 ''It's a very scary system,'' said Tinatin Khidasheli, a human rights lawyer. ''The system is absolutely unbalanced and depends on the good will of the president. We just hope Saakashvili will not use all the powers in the Constitution because if he tries, he could easily become a dictator.''
 Last month, Koba Davitashvili, a close associate of Mr. Saakashvili, resigned as leader of the governing party to protest the president's concentration of power and pressure on news organizations. 
 For now, though, Mr. Saakashvili remains a national hero.
 ''This is a very critical moment in Georgian history and I think the majority of Georgians support the measures carried out by the government,'' said George Khutsishvili, chairman of the International Center on Conflict and Negotiation, a local policy institute. 
 ''These are temporary measures,'' he added. ''When the government is in power only several months we should give them a chance to consolidate power and stabilize the situation. That's the first step.''
 The most aggressive and visible of the president's actions has been the arrests of a stream of powerful people accused of corruption. Several arrests have been shown on television, sometimes with the smashing of doors and waving of guns. 
 The strong-arm tactics and emerging reports of torture have drawn criticism from local and foreign human rights groups. Critics also say the government seems to be picking and choosing its targets, sometimes for political reasons.
 The president says he is sending a message. ''The era of Shevardnadze, when lawlessness reigned, is over,'' he said. ''If anyone thinks that I am joking, they are mistaken.'' 
 His riskiest move was to challenge the chieftain of the renegade province of Ajaria, who has a private army and has withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in customs fees and taxes. After blockading the province for four days last week, Mr. Saakashvili announced that he had solved the problem. For now, though, he seems to have gained little except a promise to allow the parliamentary election to proceed in Ajaria.
 His headlong approach was characteristic of his style, and the vagueness of its results has not enhanced his image.
 Mr. Saakashvili has won praise for streamlining government by cutting the number of ministries. His new cabinet, though, seems something of a gamble. It is largely drawn from civil society groups and other supporters of his opposition movement. Many ministers have little administrative experience, and some are in their 20's or 30's. 
 The loyalty of news organizations to the president has also affected their vigor. The support of major television stations was crucial to Mr. Saakashvili's rise to power, and they now seem to operate almost as part of his government team. 
 The two most freewheeling and popular political talk shows have been taken off the air, and commentary has become tamer. Journalists at a station critical of the president say they have received threats and warnings. Last month, they marched down a major avenue carrying a coffin that they said symbolized the death of a free press. 
 ''So now Georgia really does lack an independent, free and strong media, which was one of Georgia's advantages and one of the major driving forces for the revolution,'' said Archil Gegeshidze, a leading political analyst.

HEADLINE: From a Bohemian on Broadway To a Prince in the Opera House

BYLINE: By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
WELL before Baz Luhrmann came calling, Jesus Garcia had been warned. ''A friend,'' Mr. Garcia says, harking back to late 2001, ''I won't say her name, but in charge of a very big company in the classical-music business, told me that there was about to be a production of 'La Boheme' on Broadway. 'I hear they're looking for you,' she said. 'Don't do it.' ''
 But he did, and like the other nine singers who shared the opera's four principal roles, he has a special Tony Award to show for it. Which of the Three Tenors ever got one of those?
 One morning early this month, with spring in the air, Mr. Garcia, a lithe 27-year-old, is telling his story on a bench in Rittenhouse Square. Born in Houston, he pronounces his first name the Spanish way -- hay-SOOS -- but no longer writes it with an accent. The bohemian shag he wore as Puccini's penniless poet Rodolfo has been cropped to a uniform fraction of an inch, the black salted with precocious white. 
 His alma mater, just steps away, is the Academy of Vocal Arts, which advertises ''world-class training for opera singers.'' Home is a sun-drenched studio apartment in Center City, monastically vacant but for a mattress, a yoga mat, a small bookcase, a picture of a blond Jesus swathed in Indian silks (his forehead bearing a red dot) and an iBook, which stores, among other things, the demo of pop songs he is writing.
 A major point of reference is the pop star and self-styled ''anti-celebrity'' Bjork, for whom Mr. Garcia expresses ''complete admiration as an artist, poet and musician.'' Mr. Garcia paints and draws and is in the process of founding a theatrical production company called Brahmin Industries. His new Web site, rockthejesus.com, should be up and running any minute.
 So has Mr. Garcia kissed opera goodbye? Not at all. On Saturday he returns to the Washington National Opera, where he made his debut in September as Alfred, the singing teacher with the aphrodisiac high notes in Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus.'' Now he is playing Don Ramiro, the Prince Charming of Rossini's retelling of the Cinderella story, ''La Cenerentola.'' Contrary to many dire predictions, there is life after Baz.
 With all due respect to its superb theatrical values, the Luhrmann ''Boheme'' raised definite musical issues. It used a severely reduced orchestra, supplemented with synthesizers. The singers, despite their operatic training and the modest capacity of the Broadway house, used microphones.
 One rising tenor in the audience, already familiar in principal lyric roles at the Metropolitan Opera, squirmed through a performance in sympathetic agony. The sheer emotionalism of the music and the heavy performing schedule, he thought, were a recipe for disaster.
 At intermission, he was blue-lipped with indignation. Young singers, he insisted, should sound fresh, not so old and frayed. They were being shredded, he said, and once their voices were used up, there would be no way back.
 Mr. Garcia was well aware of what people were saying. ''I knew the buzz,'' he says now. But he seemed more at home in his part than most of his colleagues. Of Mr. Luhrmann's three Rodolfos -- the others were Alfred Boe, an Englishman, and David Miller, an American -- only he displayed the sensuous Latin timbre and instinctive pathos Puccini's writing implies. Was he in over his head? Very possibly. Yet not altogether out of his element.
 What draws a boy in Houston to opera? In Mr. Garcia's case, not the Met radio broadcasts. Not a performance at the Houston Grand Opera. Certainly not the influence of his parents (his mother a banking executive, his father a carpenter and teacher of vocational arts), whom he characterizes as ''anti-stage-parents,'' more apt to discourage an economically precarious career in the arts than to promote it.
 What Mr. Garcia wanted to be, growing up, was a pop star like Michael Jackson and Madonna, whose videos held him spellbound.
 ''They were just such fascinating people,'' he says, ''and what they put on the screen was great music theater, instant gratification.'' In high school, he started taking private voice lessons. Then he heard a CD of Luciano Pavarotti and was enraptured by the sheer sound.
 ''Another tenor,'' Mr. Garcia says. ''I thought I could do that.''
 A second revelation followed at the movie ''Philadelphia.'' ''Maria Callas was singing 'La mamma morta,' '' Mr. Garcia recalls. ''It fascinated me emotionally. It ripped me to shreds.''
 At the Academy of Vocal Arts, Mr. Garcia found his niche in Mozart and the bel canto repertory, where purity of line and nimble articulation matter more than a big sound. One day he was perplexed to hear a mentor say that he seemed to have become more preoccupied with technique than with art.
 ''I didn't think that was true,'' Mr. Garcia says now, ''but maybe I'd gotten robotic. And maybe he was trying to get me to take the next step.''
 What is true is that by temperament Mr. Garcia gravitates toward the heavier emotional weather of verismo, the style associated with Puccini and other Italian composers around the turn of the 20th century.
 ''In bel canto,'' he says, ''what happens is this: You get in position and basically say to the audience, 'Now I'll sing one emotion for five pages.' In verismo, it's like a movie. The music keeps changing. What I like is realism onstage, not costumes, not pageantry.
 ''I love all the things I can't sing. So for now, I'm singing only bel canto, so as not to mess up my chances. I don't want to compromise what I've worked so hard to build.''
 ''La Boheme,'' in other words, was a calculated risk, motivated in large part by the opportunity to work with Mr. Luhrmann, whose movie of ''Romeo and Juliet'' had struck Mr. Garcia with the force of revelation. ''It was the first time I could follow Shakespeare without missing a beat,'' he said, ''without feeling that it was over my head.''
 Even so, Mr. Garcia stipulated from the beginning that he would sing only two shows a week. And alone among the original three Rodolfos, he dropped out before the end of the Broadway run. ''It was time,'' he says. ''My voice was tired.''
 But according to Mr. Luhrmann, who jokingly called him Young Pavarotti, Mr. Garcia had grown tremendously. ''What was a joy working with Jesus,'' Mr. Luhrmann said recently, ''was to see him go from virtually no grasp of the dramatic process to embracing it fully. I think he's a very good example of the way vocal growth can align with development as a dramatic player.''
 To rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the opera world, Mr. Garcia entered the Operalia competition, sponsored by Placido Domingo, and won.
 Opera fans are forever debating singers' repertory choices, and the high percentage of break-out talents who crash and burn suggests the difficulty of matching their gifts to the demands of their profession. Mr. Domingo, at 63, is the incontestable champion on that score, still juggling some of the most demanding tenor roles with conducting gigs and the general directorships of not only the Washington National Opera but also the Los Angeles Opera.
 ''I first heard Jesus Garcia a couple of years ago, before he sang 'Boheme' on Broadway, and was immediately impressed by his voice,'' Mr. Domingo said recently from Moscow. ''Later, everyone who heard him at Operalia was impressed with the quality of his voice and his artistry. I think he can become one of the really exciting singers of his generation if he doesn't let himself be rushed into roles which might come later in his career. Something tells me that he has analyzed his career path very well.''
 The offers of Alfred and Don Ramiro in Washington, Mr. Domingo added, had as much to do with Mr. Garcia's personality as with vocal considerations, and Mr. Garcia clearly entertains offers in the same spirit. Other tenors of comparable profile would snap up the part of Rossini's Count Almaviva in ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' or Mozart's Don Ottavio in ''Don Giovanni.'' Having sung both in school, Mr. Garcia professes no further interest in the Mozart role (''boring'') and has turned down an offer from a major European house for the Rossini.
 Don Ramiro strikes him as ''more heroic and more lyric'' than Almaviva. ''You can really sing it,'' he says. ''It's a very masculine role, not something foppish and jokey.''
 Among the legacies of his spell on Broadway is a contract with a Hollywood agent for film and television work. What will come of it is anyone's guess, as are his prospects as a pop artist. But one thing Mr. Garcia promises never to do is the sort of operatic pop that has made millionaires of tenors like Andrea Bocelli and Josh Groban.
 ''I'm definitely playing both sides of the fence,'' Mr. Garcia says. ''And whatever the medium, whatever I do, I want to pursue it full force. There's very little I don't want to do. But I'm not into joining the two cultures at the expense of either one.''

HEADLINE: American Dreams, Not Made In the U.S.A.

 BODY:
STEVE JAMES won't like being called the ''Hoop Dreams'' guy, but there it is: that beloved 1994 documentary about two high school basketball players in Chicago, which won practically every major award except the Oscar, remains his best-known work.
 Since then he's made several feature films, including ''Prefontaine'' (1997), about the runner Steve Prefontaine; and another highly personal documentary project, ''Stevie,'' covering more than four years in the life of a troubled young man for whom Mr. James had once served as a Big Brother. 
 Now he has an even more labor-intensive project coming to the screen: ''The New Americans,'' a three-night, seven-hour documentary (culled from 1,100 hours of film) that begins tomorrow at 9 p.m. Eastern on PBS stations. It follows five immigrant tales -- families from Nigeria, Mexico, India and the West Bank and a pair of Dodgers farmhands from the Dominican Republic -- for three to four years, both before and after coming to America. Mr. James worked with other producers, including Gordon Quinn, a partner on ''Hoop Dreams,'' and Gita Saedi, and six other directors. He spoke with Mike Hale recently by phone from his Chicago office.

MIKE HALE -- ''The New Americans'' often feels like a companion piece to ''Hoop Dreams.''

STEVE JAMES -- I think in some ways, stylistically, it's in the same vein. We started with people in their country of origin, before they become immigrants, and not only get to know them in their own countries but also hear of their dreams and expectations for America. In ''Hoop Dreams'' you met these kids in their neighborhoods as dreamers, they were dreaming of greatness and of getting to the N.B.A. We started with people at a turning point, where their lives are about to change in dramatic ways.

HALE -- Where did you get the idea for such a large project on the subject of immigration?

JAMES -- Oddly enough, it came to me back in 1994, during the final stages of ''Hoop Dreams.'' It was a time when Patrick Buchanan was talking very publicly about the need to close the borders with Mexico. And there was a lot of discussion in Congress about welfare reform and the impact of immigrants on our economy. I'm a pretty liberal guy, but I recognized that I was sort of unsettled by a lot of this and wasn't sure how I felt about immigration and about issues of undocumented workers coming from Mexico. I think I shared a lot of the same questions that a lot of Americans had at that time.
 And the other thing is, I was doing a lot more traveling because of ''Hoop Dreams.'' And I'm one of these guys that talks to cabbies. And invariably in big cities, cabbies are immigrants. And I would strike up these conversations with cabbies about where they're from, why they came here, what they used to do back home. And invariably they had fascinating stories that I thought to be quite revealing of America today.
 And so it struck me -- if in ''Hoop Dreams'' we were trying to look at the American dream through the eyes of inner-city black families and these two boys aspiring to make it, it would be really interesting to do something akin to that with contemporary immigrants and look at the American dream and the American myth of the melting pot through their eyes. And in the process, inquire into something that I felt a need to understand better.
 This is not in the series, but it was revealing to me: at one point, in the Nigerian story, Israel was talking about his dreams of earning an M.B.A. and being successful in business. And I said, ''Oh, is that your American dream?'' And he looked at me and said, ''No, that's my Nigerian dream.''

HALE -- The sense of being torn -- between homeland and America, between family and America, between culture and America -- is so central to the film. Did you know going in that that was your story?

JAMES -- No. You'd have to ask the other filmmakers directly, because some of them were much more sophisticated about this than I was. Indu Krishnan is from India; Carlos Aparicio and Susana Aikin were born in Spain and are immigrants themselves; Renee Tajima-Pena is first-generation Japanese-American. My immigrant roots are more deeply buried. Having said that, I was surprised. Part of the myth of the immigrant experience is that immigrants come to America and embrace this new country wholeheartedly, and make a break with their past. And I think there was a time in our history when that was more true than it is today. Many of our subjects felt that in leaving the familiar behind and the tightknit communities and families they came from, and coming to America, that America is not a place where you can find that very easily.

HALE -- There are scenes where the camera is inside the room as the Mexican family, or the Palestinian couple, are trying to get visas. Did you worry about the filming influencing events?

JAMES -- It would have been so easy for the consulate, particularly in the Mexico story, to make a show to the cameras and kind of slide them through and look like heroes. And they didn't. I'm actually, frankly, more amazed at how little impact we do have. Israel, the Nigerian refugee, still struggled to get a decent job in America; Naima, the Palestinian, still struggled to get employed when she first got here. You can run down the list of all the things that happened to these people in this series, and you see some pretty amazing things, turns of events with the cameras rolling, that you would think, if someone was really trying to be shrewd about it, it wouldn't have happened that way.
 There's no question that filming on some level influences events. I think the more profound influence, at least in the work we've done, is that by filming you're giving your subjects an opportunity to reflect on their lives. You're there, you're asking them to think about what they're doing and where they've come and where they're headed. And that's not something we normally do. To the extent that it makes people think, it may affect some decisions they make. But it's more of a byproduct of the almost therapeutic process that goes on in these kinds of documentaries.

HALE -- I'm guessing that you basically thought you were done, at least with the filming, before Sept. 11 happened. It seems as if it must have had a profound impact on how you put the series together, on how you thought about the world you were putting it into.

JAMES -- Certainly it was winding down. It's interesting. Once we got our bearings, we wondered whether this happening so late was going to present a real problem -- whether we should keep filming for a lot longer, which we couldn't afford, whether it would in some ways make what had come before seem less important. But we realized that the opposite would be true. In the wake of 9/11 a lot of people in the news media rushed out to get the temperature of the people, to take the pulse. And we had already been deeply into these people's lives for years. And I think that it allowed us to not do the obvious thing. We talked about trying to ask all our subjects what they felt about 9/11 and including that at the end of the film. And we did it with some of our subjects, but we decided, no, we're just going to keep telling the story.

HALE -- What's it like embarking on something like this, which is an aesthetic commitment, a business commitment and a commitment of years of your life? Which you do over and over again.

JAMES -- I've done it now three times between ''Hoop Dreams,'' ''Stevie'' and this series. This is hard in a lot of ways and it requires an inordinate amount of patience and determination on the part of a lot of people because, often as not, at a certain point you're not sure where the money's going to come from to finish it. You just know that, one way or the other, we have to finish it.
 But there's nothing quite as thrilling and eye-opening and, frankly, moving as following people's lives like this. You feel like you're living inside their lives, and inside this kind of elaborate novel where the story is unfolding and you don't know the end. I never believe writers when they say they don't know where their story's going and they let their characters lead them. But maybe it's true because it certainly is true with us.

HALE -- The series is clearly made from a liberal, pro-immigration point of view -- the melting pot is good -- that may not sit well with all viewers.

JAMES -- But you know, I think there's so much in the series that . . . well, it'll be interesting to see what the critical response is. The series has already played in the Netherlands and in Australia. And the theme of those reviews was, America presents itself to the world as the melting pot, the nation of immigrants. And this series shows you that it's not that way. Israel is a man who's full of optimism coming out of the refugee camp. But he proceeds to be beaten down through the course of the series. Anjan comes, has a job, loses a job, is not successful and is forced to send his wife and child back to India. Jose ends up out of baseball. Hatem and Naima buy a house, but I don't know. It's kind of a bittersweet end to that story. And then in the Mexico story they end up going to work in the fields of California. As their neighbor says, they're actually going the opposite direction of the way people in Mexico dream of going, which is starting in the fields and getting to the factories. So I don't know. Frankly, we worried more that people would see the series as a downer.

HALE -- You've made a few dramatic features. Is that something you plan to do more of?

JAMES -- I'd like to do more of those. And I'd love to do something that doesn't have a sports theme and that doesn't have to be a true story. I've kind of been pigeon-holed. In Hollywood, if you make a successful film, whether narrative or nonfiction, they want you to do the same thing.

HALE -- Any other projects kicking around?

JAMES -- Well, I wrote a script on Roberto Clemente. I got paid to write it some years ago. And that project has been revived. There's a hope that can happen.

HEADLINE: True but Strange

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY. 
Randy Kennedy, a reporter for The Times, is the author of ''Subwayland,'' a collection of his Tunnel Vision columns, published last month by St. Martin's Griffin.

 BODY:
OVER the next several months, as the centennial of the subway's opening approaches, New Yorkers will hear a lot about the most momentous dates in the long and fascinating life of their mass transit system. 
 Commemorating these events -- the first train from City Hall to Harlem; the deadly Malbone Street wreck; the unification of the subway system under city control; the transit strikes -- is a little like looking through family pictures of weddings and bar mitzvahs. They are the milestone events. But in any life that stretches over a century, there are also countless little moments, the minor triumphs, epiphanies and turning points that are almost forgotten. 
 Think of what follows as the unauthorized chronology of the subway, a baker's dozen of its most underappreciated moments:

First Successful Baby Carriage Expedition
(April 1906)
 An article in The New York Times proclaims almost breathlessly: ''The fourteen-months-old baby of John Royalson, a clerk in a Chambers Street hardware store in East New York, made street railroad history in Manhattan yesterday.'' Apparently the parents of baby Royalson manage to get his carriage into the subway on their way home from Central Park, to the astonishment of everyone on the train. The ride ends at the Brooklyn Bridge ''when the Royalsons, escorted by an admiring throng, walked triumphantly through the station'' on their way to catch a trolley.

Introduction of the Turnstile
(June 1906)
 Subway officials announce the installation of the first turnstile at the 110th Street station. Fears spread that ticket choppers, the men who collect the paper predecessor of the token from passengers, will lose their jobs. An official assures workers that turnstiles will not replace them: ''It is absurd to suppose that we can get along with fewer men than we now have.'' (By 1921, turnstiles are replacing ticket choppers all over the system, although there are still some kinks to work out with the turnstile. One prototype has long arms that trap passengers until they pay. ''This type did not prove satisfactory,'' The Times said, ''because it invited considerable congestion when fat passengers sought to make the passage.'')

Emergence Of Subway Buffs
(July 1921)
 Subway workers report that they have begun to notice oddly enthusiastic people who ride the subway all day with no particular destination in mind. They refer to these people as ''joy riders'' or ''buffs.'' An article in The Times describes the buffs this way: ''This type of joy rider gets on a train, rides to its terminal, crosses the platform to another train and walks clear to its front end and rides through to the end of the line.'' A conductor notes: ''I've put 'em off sometimes and they don't kick none. They just wait for another train.''

Crackdown on Subway Entertainment
(April 1935)
 James C. Shramm, 24, is arrested and sentenced to a day in jail for dancing with a fire ax in the track bed at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue. A northbound local was bearing down on him at the time. Mr. Shramm, an unemployed waiter and saxophone player, tells a judge he got the ax at a party in Queens and was simply taking it home.

Debut of Fake Nuns
(February 1948)
 The Better Business Bureau of New York announces that many women seen recently in the subway dressed as nuns and collecting alms are not, in fact, nuns. According to a report by the bureau, the ''nuns'' pay $2.50 a day to an ''unnamed organization'' for official-seeming church credentials, which they return at the end of their workday. An article in The Times added that the nuns ''formerly worked on a percentage basis'' but ''the organization found it was not getting its share and hence devised the day-to-day system.'' 

Red Menace at the Doors
(January 1955)
 Max Lerner, a subway conductor for 19 years, is fired from his job as a security risk because he refuses to answer questions about his suspected Communist affiliations. A Supreme Court justice in Brooklyn upholds the decision.

Pole-Vaulter Not Killed
(February 1955)
 The Rev. Robert E. Richards, an Olympic gold medalist in the pole vault (left), reports that he has carried his 16-foot steel pole onto the IRT without incident. He had been unable to find a cooperative cabdriver. An article in The Times about Mr. Richards's subway ride reports: ''To travel companionably with an intractable, hingeless, 16-foot 'metal monster' takes rare qualities. A pole-vaulter not only has to be an exceptional athlete but he must also be a man of vast foresight, immense ingenuity, overwhelming persuasiveness and boundless good humor.'' The article quotes a subway worker's words to Mr. Richards: ''I don't know how you done it. But don't never do it again.'' 

New Kind of Rider Noticed
(July 1960)
 A pair of rhesus monkeys (above) are spotted hanging around in the subway downtown. One is caught; the second eludes capture for several days. A Times reporter describes one sighting: ''The monkey was standing on the northbound platform at the Rector Street station, as if waiting for a train, according to a passenger who made a report at the change booth.'' This second monkey was finally caught after startled pedestrians saw its fingers protruding through a sidewalk grate near Rector Street. 

Ski Service Added
(January 1964)
 A special nonstop train is operated briefly between Times Square and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, where a ski slope has been set up over Holes 15 through 18 of the park's golf course. Riders take their skis on board, and among the first to take the ski express are a couple from Houston, ''three boys from Long Island in search of girls,'' The Times said, ''and a 200-pound St. Bernard named Brandy, who has never saved anyone because he lives in an apartment house in Queens.'' 

Woman 'Buys' M.T.A. for $1
(June 1975)
 At a hearing, a director of the agency that runs the subway says the M.T.A. is so hard up that no private transit operator would want to buy it, perhaps because ridership has fallen to its lowest level since 1918, and 95 percent of the trains are marked with graffiti. He jokingly offers to sell the agency for a dollar. A woman in the audience whips out a dollar bill and announces: ''I'm taking you up. And now you're all fired.'' According to an account in The Times, she then lectured the board loudly for 15 minutes.

Subway Takes Star Turn
(February 1979)
 The movie ''The Warriors'' is released. Based loosely on ''Anabasis,'' Xenophon's epic tale of Greek mercenaries, the film tells the story of a street gang that must fight its way from the Bronx back to Coney Island, and much of the journey is made by subway. The movie is blamed for causing gang violence in theaters, but it also causes flashes of recognition from frustrated riders. One gang member in the movie, Vermin, is heard to complain: ''How much longer we gotta wait? We might be here forever. I'm sick of waiting for trains!''

Police Try Bold New Strategy
(July 1980)
 Subway police officers begin handing out cards to riders that read: ''Hello. This note is not meant to alarm you, but to inform you that the NYC Transit Police Dept. needs your help in preventing CRIME by not becoming a VICTIM.'' The card includes some helpful tips on how to avoid becoming one.

Boy Takes Train, Literally
(May 1993)
 Keron Thomas, 16 (below), posing as a subway motorman, takes an A train carrying hundreds of passengers on a 47-mile trip through the city until he triggers an emergency brake because he is speeding. It is the first known theft of a subway train, and the thief receives probation. He later says of his caper: ''It gave me a lot more self-confidence. It showed me that you can do whatever you want to do. You just got to put your mind to it.''


CORRECTION-DATE: April 11, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A selection of excerpts on March 28 from songs and literature about the subways, in the special issue on the system's hundredth anniversary, misstated the year for ''Take the A Train.'' It was 1941, not 1933.

HEADLINE: Vague on Leadership, Dangerous on the Attack

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
HAMAS, the principal Islamic Palestinian group staging suicide bombings and other attacks on Israeli targets, has a leadership structure that is kept vague to the general public. Its military wing works in secret, while its social services attract popular support in the absence of effective delivery of similar services by the Palestinian Authority.
 Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the group's founder and spiritual leader, was clearly the most important figure until he was killed last week in a rocket attack launched from an Israeli helicopter. 
 With him gone, Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantisi, an advocate of uncompromising struggle with Israel, has been named leader of the group in the Gaza Strip, its main stronghold. There will be no new spiritual leader, and Khaled Mashaal, based in Syria, remains head of the Hamas political bureau, the top decision-making body. Mr. Rantisi is expected to lead operations in the West Bank as well as Gaza. 
 Hamas is considered much more disciplined, organized and dangerous to Israelis than two other Palestinian factions that carry out attacks, Islamic Jihad and Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. Islamic Jihad, like Hamas, has a religious base; the brigades group is linked to the more secular Fatah, Yasir Arafat's political base. Recently, the three factions appear to have cooperated on some attacks.
 Hamas draws its support among the poor and the religious, and the vast majority of Gazans fall into these groups. In Gaza, Hamas has been gaining ground on Fatah, though polls show Fatah still has more supporters there. The large Hamas network of social and welfare programs has been a key to winning supporters in three years of fighting, during which the Palestinian economy has collapsed.
 Hamas has been behind almost half of the more than 100 suicide bombings carried out by Palestinians since fighting began in September 2000. All the bombers except two started on their missions from the West Bank. In Gaza, Hamas has been behind regular rocket and mortar fire directed at Jewish settlements and at Israeli communities over the border. 
 Hamas operates on funds raised from private donors in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Gulf, from other Muslim countries and from within the United States and Europe, which have tried to shut down the fundraising.

 BODY:

REEFER MADNESS: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market, by Eric Schlosser. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) The author of ''Fast Food Nation'' examines three facets of America's estimated $650 billion underground economy: the pornography industry, marijuana cultivation and the plight of illegal immigrants who harvest strawberries in California. His goal seems to be ''a refutation of Adam Smith's theory of the modern market economy,'' Sam Sifton wrote in these pages in 2003. ''Schlosser is a fine and diligent reporter with a real gift for description, and his three dispatches are fascinating pieces of work.''

REGARDING THE PAIN OF OTHERS, by Susan Sontag. (Picador, $11.) In her long, provocative essay on the photographic representation of suffering and cruelty, from the Civil War to the Nazi death camps, from Bosnia to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Sontag reflects on how we process such images, the limits of shock and the motives of those behind the cameras. The result is a ''coruscating sermon,'' John Leonard said here last year. ''She knows lots of things the rest of us only wish we did.''

THE HEALING LAND: The Bushmen and the Kalahari Desert, by Rupert Isaacson. (Grove, $13.) The Bushmen of the Kalahari in southern Africa have one of the oldest human cultures, and the author recounts their history, rituals and struggle for survival, including their drunken, violent life in exile from their homeland. The Bushmen ''have long deserved the attentions of a levelheaded writer who wouldn't simplify their magic and ruination into a sentimental legend,'' Michael Pye said here last year.

SONS OF MISSISSIPPI: A Story of Race and Its Legacy, by Paul Hendrickson. (Vintage, $15.) Winner of a National Book Critics Circle award, this account centers on a 1962 Life magazine photograph of seven lawmen whooping it up just before the fiery riot started by whites trying to block James Meredith from enrolling in the University of Mississippi. Last year our reviewer, Brent Staples, was unpersuaded by the author's attempt to bring these stonelike figures to life and to provide context for racist attitudes in the South. On the contrary, he wrote, ''what 'Sons of Mississippi' teaches more than anything else is that stereotypes are real.''

THE NERVE, by Glyn Maxwell. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) These low-key poems, which never wander far from the English verse tradition, employ a conversational or faux-naif voice as they explore subjects like the Leonid meteor showers or a roadside fair and move confidently toward expressions of common feeling. ''Maxwell is an intelligent and sensitive writer,'' David Orr wrote here in 2002, and '' 'The Nerve' is one of the most enjoyable books of this year.'' Knopf has reissued two posthumously published collections of Kenneth Koch's verse, Sun Out: Selected Poems, 1952-1954 and A Possible World: Poems (each $15). ''Both are exuberant records of a life well lived in both seriousness and humor,'' Melanie Rehak said in these pages in 2002. ''Whether Koch is remembering himself in youth . . . or traveling in Thailand, he is aware of and awestruck by the immensity of experience and his own endless hunger for more.''

A MEMORY OF WAR, by Frederick Busch. (Ballantine, $14.95.) In this talk-filled novel, a Manhattan psychologist is confronted by a patient who claims to be his half brother, saying that during World War II their Jewish mother had an affair with a German SS interpreter who was a prisoner of war in England. That unsettling contention raises many questions for the psychologist and sets off a crisis in his already complicated inner life. Last year in the Book Review, Bruce Bawer admired the tale's ''genuineness of feeling'' and ''breadth of ambition.''

SOLITAIRE, by Kelley Eskridge. (Eos/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Even though its plotting is a bit far-fetched, this 2002 science-fiction thriller about a privileged young woman sentenced to eight years of high-tech ''virtual confinement'' inside her own head impressed our reviewer, Gerald Jonas. ''Eskridge's evocation'' of her ordeal ''is a stylistic and psychological tour de force,'' he wrote. ''The horrors she confronts, the defenses she mounts, the things she learns are treated with a painful but bracing clarity.'' Scott Veale

HEADLINE: The Backbone of Bayonne

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

DATELINE: BAYONNE 

 BODY:
VINNY BOTTINO says he has become convinced that his life is a lot like that of George Bailey in the movie ''It's a Wonderful Life.''
 So what if Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart, lived in the fictitious but idyllic small town of Bedford Falls, N.Y., while Mr. Bottino lives in Bayonne, that faded industrial city best known for its once-thriving shipping terminals and refineries? Never mind that Bailey's family business was banking, while Mr. Bottino's is a bar and restaurant.
 And leave aside the film's treatments of suicide and alcoholism. No, what Mr. Bottino was referring to is the movie's message of family and friendship, of a man who in the end is grateful for living in the town where he grew up, because that is where he finds love and support and financial success. 
 Mr. Bottino is one of four generations of Bottinos to live in Bayonne. His paternal grandfather, Vincent Bottino, came here in 1925 from Torre del Greco, near Naples.
 Vincent was a bricklayer and his wife, Georgina, a seamstress. They worked hard and attended Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church, like many of the Italian immigrant families here who were the backbone of Bayonne.
 Their son, also named Vincent, bought the Big Apple Bar in 1976, and when he retired four years ago, two of his seven children -- Vincent Jr., the eldest, known as Vinny, and Mark, the youngest -- took it over.
 ''I love Bayonne,'' Vinny Bottino, 47, said as he sat in the restaurant part of his establishment on Broadway. ''I've been here all my life. I'm happy here. My kids are happy.'' 
 In many ways, the story of the Bottinos is the story of the families who make up Bayonne, a city of 62,000. Situated on a peninsula at the edge of Upper New York Bay, it is a stable place of one-, two- and three-family homes, many handed down from parent to child through the generations.
 Joe Ryan, a past president of the Bayonne Historical Society, said that the majority of the city's residents had lived here for at least two generations, and many of their families came here by way of Ellis Island. 
 ''The sense of community and sense of family ties is a lot stronger here than in a lot of newer parts of the country,'' said Mr. Ryan, now public information director for the city. ''There's a stronger sense of continuity here than in suburban areas where corporate families move every two to three years. Bayonne is more stable than that.''
 But for many families, that kind of continuity was broken by the economic shocks the city has suffered over the decades.
 A couple of generations ago Bayonne was a bustling industrial city and one of the largest oil refinery centers in the world. In the 1920's, Standard Oil was its largest employer, with more than 6,000 workers. During World War II, Bayonne also became home to a large shipping terminal, built on a manmade peninsula jutting into New York Bay. At one time the installation -- the Military Ocean Terminal -- employed 3,000 people.
 When Vincent and Elaine Bottino bought the bar in 1976, it catered to longshoremen from the terminal, and others working in the factories that once dominated this city, like Texaco and Best Foods, which made Hellmann's mayonnaise here. 
 ''I used to open the bar up at 6 a.m.,'' said Elaine Bottino, 72, ''because there were people who came in after they got off the night shift.'' 
 But Texaco cleared out its storage and refinery operations in the 1980's, and the Military Ocean Terminal shut down in 1999. The Best Foods plant, which had been taken over by Unilever, closed last year. Once the industries departed, so did many of the jobs. And once the jobs left, so did many of the Big Apple's patrons.
 But Bayonne is a scrappy city. Take the Military Ocean Terminal. The city, which now controls the old military post along with the dozens of warehouses and other buildings left behind, has plans to build thousands of homes on the 437-acre waterfront parcel. 
 In the meantime, the acres of open land and old buildings have been discovered by Hollywood. The director Ron Howard shot ''A Beautiful Mind,'' starring Russell Crowe, at a sound stage there. In 2001, the HBO series ''Oz'' began filming there after the producers turned Building 73, a warehouse, into a maximum-security prison set.
 At a nearby waterfront location, a golf course is being built on a former waste disposal site. And in December, the cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean International announced that it would move the Nordic Empress and one of the world's largest cruise ships, the 3,114-passenger Voyager of the Seas, to Bayonne for cruises starting in May.
 A light-rail line that offers easy access from Bayonne to Jersey City and the PATH is making the city more attractive to commuters who work in financial services and other white-collar jobs in Manhattan. But Bayonne is still the kind of place where, if you're from the neighborhood, the world is your oyster -- and if not, well, good luck, pal.
 If Bayonne has reinvented itself, so have the Bottinos and the Big Apple Bar.
 Vinny Bottino said the city had more than 100 bars when his father opened the Big Apple. Now it has about 70.
 ''We live off our own people, since we don't get a lot of outsiders coming here,'' he said. ''In the early 80's our family realized it was time to change, so we went to a sports bar, and it took off.''
 The top of the bar now bears five satellite dishes, and two dozen screens line the walls inside, so patrons can watch every kind of sports event.
 And because people no longer drink as much as they used to, the family also took over the space next door four years ago and turned it into a restaurant that caters to families, with outdoor seating in the back.
 Vinny and his wife, Toni, work at the bar and restaurant at least six days a week, they said. Mark, 37, a Bayonne firefighter, works here on his days off.
 Their father, the elder Vincent Bottino, retired in the 80's. After he and his wife turned the bar business over to their sons, they moved down to Florida, where other family members live. Mr. Bottino died of colon cancer three years ago, but in all the time he lived down there, recalled his widow, who has since returned, her husband's license plate always read, ''Bayonne.''
 ''He loved where he came from,'' she said.
 Mrs. Bottino now lives with Vinny and Toni and their children on West 8th Street, in the same three-family house where she reared them. Mark lives with his wife and daughter on Avenue A, in the house where his father grew up.
 Mrs. Bottino, whose parents were of Irish descent, said she met her husband at a dance at St. Andrew's Catholic Church when they were both teenagers. At 17, he was supporting his widowed mother. The couple courted, but he did not want to marry until he was able to support his bride. 
 Then, when he was 19 and working at Tidewater, a company that made tar and paint products, he lost his right hand in a machine that put the lids on the tar cans.
 ''He had 13 operations,'' his widow recalled. ''Today they probably could have saved his hand.''
 He was laid off by Tidewater after the accident, but went into business for himself as a milkman. Only then did he feel he was ready to marry and start a family, Mrs. Bottino said. Before he finally bought the bar, she said, he sold insurance for a while. 
 ''He was a hard worker,'' she said. 
 So were her children. Some of the older ones helped their parents at the bar.
 For 15 years, the Bottino boys had a paper route delivering The Bayonne Times, now The Jersey Journal. One of the sons, Freddy, was riding his bicycle one Saturday morning when he was hit by a truck. He was 9 years old.
 Mark remembers that day. A friend named John D'Onofrio had been riding with Freddy. ''John came riding down the block and he said, 'Bottino, I got to tell you something,''' he said. ''And the way he said it, he was so nervous. He said, 'Freddy got hit by a truck,' and he just took off on his bike and ran to his house.'' 
 ''I ran in the house and told my father and my mother,'' Mark said, his voice shaking. ''Vinny and our other brother George ran down there, but by then it was too late.''
 ''George picked him up, dead on the street,'' Mrs. Bottino recalled.
 There are so many memories in the town, more good ones than bad, that Vinny Bottino said he would never leave. He and Mark both married women who grew up in Bayonne, so their children have extended family here on both sides. Mark's wife, DeeDee, works for the city's urban enterprise zone.
 The brothers both own antique cars, and take part in a car show that makes its way down Broadway once a month during the summer. Mark has a 1968 Firebird convertible and Vinny a 1970 GTO.
 Because they were athletes as schoolboys, the two brothers sponsor several youth teams in town. ''It's my way of giving back,'' Vinny said.
 Last Sunday, Vinny was named Man of the Year by the Bayonne Police Department's chapter of the Emerald Society. He rode down Broadway in the city's St. Patrick's Day Parade. 
 ''Sometimes I think about leaving here,'' Vinny said, ''but then I think, nah, my heart's here in Bayonne.''

HEADLINE: Through The Roof

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

DATELINE: BRIDGEWATER 

 BODY:
WHEN Andrew McElroy ventured once again into the frantic, caffeinated, buy-buy-buy real estate market here recently, he wasn't quite sure what to expect. But shortly after he put his town house on the market, he found out just how hyperactive sales here can be. In his case, ''shortly'' turned out to be 24 hours.
 ''We put it on the market on a Monday, and we had 13 or 14 people who wanted to see it,'' recalled Mr. McElroy, 29. ''Tuesday, we had offers. It took one day, basically.''
 That kind of pace did not come as a complete surprise to him: Two years ago, when he and his wife, Michele, bought the town house, it happened the same way -- a contract was signed within a single day of the property entering the market. 
 ''It's been crazy for a few years now,'' Mr. McElroy said. ''But I never expected to see it continue like this.''
 Not only has the fevered market continued, real estate agents and other experts say it is getting more intense. Across the New York metropolitan region, high demand, limited supply and mortgage rates that sit at almost historically low levels have combined to drive the suburban real estate market. Price tags have jumped even in places like 43,000-person Bridgewater, which has long enjoyed a reputation for affordable home prices. 
 According to the most recent census, home values in Bridgewater increased by about a fifth from 1990 to 2000, about double the median rate of increase in the state. But now, agents and others here estimate that the prices for some homes in this part of Somerset County are increasing by about a third each year. 
 Bidding wars and multiple offers are just an accepted part of doing business here. One-day listings are not at all uncommon. And while the appreciation of home values is a boon to sellers, sociologists and other planning experts say that middle-class buyers who have traditionally looked toward communities like Bridgewater for housing in their price range often find themselves unable to buy. Average family income in the corridor between Far Hills and Bridgewater rose by half in the 1990's. In a reflection of the new wealth, real estate values grew even faster. 
 The housing market is still on fire, burning more fiercely than ever. ''You can't keep them on the market,'' said Bruce Gartner, an agent with Weichert Realtors in nearby Bedminster, who helped the McElroys sell their home. ''Unless your client's willing to go out there the day it comes on the market. You kind of sound like a used car salesman when you say that to them. But then they lose one or two and say, 'Oh, that's the way it is.'''
 Things are the way they are partly because of a dearth of available housing in this part of New Jersey and the demand generated by more than half a dozen major corporations, like Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Verizon, that have big operations in Somerset County.
 Add Bridgewater's proximity to both I-287 and I-78 and the allure of the area comes into clearer focus. According to the Census Bureau, this central New Jersey county is the state's fastest growing -- its population increased by roughly a quarter to nearly 300,000 during the 1990's. And according to that same data, the area around Bridgewater experienced the county's greatest percentage increases in home values.
 Both trends seem to have accelerated since the 2000 census. And prices haven't just jumped here in Somerset. 
 ''The market is exploding,'' said Esther Einstein, an agent with Coldwell Banker based in Flemington in the heart of Hunterdon County, New Jersey's wealthiest county. ''Right now, people are surprised if their homes don't sell in a week.''
 Those increased expectations have forced a tactical shift among many buyers. ''You come to them saying, 'How much over list do you want to go?''' Mr. Gartner said, describing how he advises customers to place initial offers above a home's listed asking price. ''You know it's going to sell over list, so just put your best foot forward.''
 Mr. Gartner, who has worked in the area for the last half a decade, sighed when asked about the intensity and competitiveness of the market. ''This seems to be about the worst we've had it,'' he said.

The Forgotten Middle Class
 Sociologists and economists say soaring real estate prices mean it simply costs more for a middle-class family to stay in the middle. Some experts see a widening gulf in the middle of the middle class, separating those who have and those who have more.
 In New Jersey there are great extremes of wealth and poverty, and then, somewhere in the middle, is a middle class whose definition is at best slippery. Nationally, if a family's annual income is $75,000, by most definitions the family belongs to the middle class. By that standard a low six-figure income would put a New Jersey family in the upper middle class nationally -- yet that family may well not be in a position to buy a house in most of New Jersey's communities.
 ''More and more it's a case of winners and losers in the middle class,'' said Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. ''There are two groups. If you have a secure and steady job, own a home, you can be doing quite well. Then there are all those people who are on a slippery slope who are afraid that they're going to lose their job or that it will go off to India.
 ''They're the ones who are the forgotten middle class,'' she said.
 Dr. Fainstein said that those most affected by skyrocketing home values in the region are first-time buyers and the young.
 ''The people for whom it's really hard are people just entering the housing market, young couples, people without a nest egg or without parents who can help them,'' she said. ''They're the middle class that's downwardly mobile, because even if you have a decent income, who has $60,000 in the bank for a down payment when they just got out of college or graduate school or wherever?''
 The current tightening of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan region is simple supply and demand. Because there is little affordable housing being built, whatever existing quality housing stock remains is sometimes fought over by prospective buyers with dueling bids.
 All of which serves to price large segments of the middle class out of some real estate markets.
 ''I don't know how people are doing it,'' said Rachel Ranis, a sociology professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. ''It's very hard for any family to buy in this market unless both parties are working.''
 At the same time it has become harder for many to enter the housing market, those who do make it want even more once they get there.
 ''People's expectations have gotten higher,'' she said. ''Before, we were happy to have just one car in a household. Now, everyone has to have a car. If you buy a house, everyone has to have a room. People have changed a lot.''
 What has remained largely constant, Professor Ranis said, are the forces that drive homebuyers into the suburbs around the region: the quest for bigger yards, better schools and perhaps a slower, more measured pace of living.
 Professor Ranis noted that another factor appears to be playing a larger role: worry.
 ''One thing we find is that you're worried that you will be able to duplicate what you've always considered middle class,'' she said. ''The key value is how to keep yourself where you are and your children, how to give them the best start.
 ''There's a lot of pressure on people to keep up with what they're accustomed to. It's no longer about keeping up with the neighbor next door, it's their own wants and what they're accustomed to.''
 But in the status-conscious suburbs, a larger home is still the No.1 symbol of success.
 ''The ones who are doing well, you see people going out and getting bigger and bigger houses,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''You look at some of these homes that have closets the size of my bedroom when I grew up.''
 And the reason size matters?
 ''It's the symbol of your achievement, the symbol of your status,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''It puts a premium on those homes with the center hall and the chandelier and all this space where you can demonstrate your lifestyle.''
 While practically no one would prefer that a community be poorer rather than richer, some experts wonder about the effects of such changes on the character of established middle-class communities.
 ''All of the suburbs that have maintained quality housing have become more and more exclusive,'' Dr. Fainstein said.
 More exclusive perhaps, but also, say some, communities in high-priced markets grow less diverse and its residents less connected socially.
 ''It has a huge impact of community connectedness,'' said Robert Fisher, the director of urban and community studies at the University of Connecticut's West Hartford campus. ''The issue of social connectedness, a lot of that has to do with destabilization. While bringing affluence into these communities, a lot of people are pushed out as well.''
 Not to mention, Dr. Fisher said, those who because of high prices never get to enter some communities in the first place. ''What's happening is that the American dream is a little bit less within the reach of a lot of people,'' he said.

An Old Crossroads
 Dutch and Scottish settlers came to this part of Somerset County in 1749. ''The early Dutch were attracted by the rivers,'' Jim Kurzenberger, president of the Somerset County Historical Society, said of the Raritan, the Millstone and a handful of tributaries that run through the county. ''With Holland being below sea level, they were accustomed to farming in low marsh areas. So they stayed in an area where they could practice their traditional agriculture.''
 As virtually everywhere else during the era, the agrarian economy dominated, but Somerset, like many surrounding counties, has also been a way to get from here to there. The Old York Road between Philadelphia and New York City passed through Somerset, and he the Camden & Amboy railroad arrived in the 1840's, followed by the Somerville-Raritan Valley line.
 The mid-19th century also saw the rise of grain mills and brickyards in the area, which flourished into the 1900's when residents of the area witnessed major transportation upgrades.
 ''You see a lot of infrastructure improvements, a lot of road improvements,'' he said. ''People like to think that a lot of that happened only with the interstates, but it was happening back then.''
 But Somerset was still sparsely populated and heavily rural, Mr. Kurzenberger said, until the end of World War II.
 ''That was the biggest change,'' he said. ''You saw the return of veterans, you starting seeing the subdivisions, but those subdivisions would be considered tame by our standards.''
 The next wave of major development here was spurred by the landmark Mt. Laurel decisions by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1975 and 1983, which found that suburban communities had to provide their share of affordable housing in the region by relaxing zoning restrictions.
 What followed was a state apparatus that set numerical goals for the amount of affordable housing in certain areas. Developers also used the decisions to leverage communities into allowing them to build higher-density developments, threatening to file suit against municipalities -- citing the decisions -- if zoning rules were not relaxed.
 ''Bridgewater was definitely affected by it, re-evaluating their zoning,'' Mr. Kurzenberger said. ''Everyone saw the writing on the wall.''
 Since then, Mr. Kurzenberger said, the changes in the county and in Bridgewater have been dramatic. According to the Census Bureau, Somerset County is the fastest growing county in the nation's most densely populated state. The county's population rose by nearly a quarter during the 90's from about 240,000 people to more than 297,000. The increases in Bridgewater mirrored that trend. Although census figures show that the township's population grew by only about 3,000 people during the 1980's -- from about 29,000 to roughly 32,000 -- an average of 1,000 new residents moved into the 33-square-mile township each year during the 90's.

Too Many Bulldozers
 Although virtually every community in the county has drafted some kind of plan to improve road capacity, traffic flow and otherwise improve Somerset's infrastructure, many longtime county residents here say that the construction and congestion can be wearing.
 ''I moved into Hillsborough 30 years ago,'' said Hubert Mertes, 62, an antique seller in Somerville. ''The day I moved in, they put a shovel in the ground and they haven't stopped since.''
 Mr. Mertes said the traffic has gotten so bad in his neighborhood that where he once could back out of his driveway and head off to work, he often has to wait for a long line of cars lined up at a stoplight to pass.
 ''It's just too many cars and not enough road,'' Mr. Mertes said.
 Mr. Mertes said that one measure of the once-rural county's development could be seen in two plots of land near his home.
 ''It was mostly farms,'' Mr. Mertes said. ''There were two big sheep farms in my neighborhood when I moved in. One of the sheep farms is now a housing development; the other is a shopping mall.
 ''My son, he moved out of the area, he won't come back down because he said it's sad what's happened.''
 Other longtime county residents, however, have welcomed the changes.
 ''We're thriving,'' said Charyl Greenberg, a lifelong Somerville resident and a co-worker of Mr. Mertes. ''Downtown U.S.A. had to reinvent itself. And compared to a lot of other towns we're thriving.'' 
 Much of that growth has been spurred by the emergence of several major employers in the area. Bridgewater alone is home to a handful of major companies like AT&T, Ethicon, Aventis and Pfizer, and Somerset County is base for about two dozen other companies with more than 500 employees apiece, according to John P. Maddocks, vice president for economic development of the Somerset County Business Partnership.
 Mr. Maddocks said that among the first companies to arrive in the area were Johnson & Johnson and AT&T, which -- just like other property buyers who settled here -- were drawn by the wide-open spaces that could still be found here in the 1970's.
 ''If you left New York City and looked west, there were limited areas where you could go,'' Mr. Maddocks said.
 But Somerset offered acres of office space land at prices attractive to companies looking for a place to put large office, research or manufacturing sites. The influx of employees filling those sites, and their families, have also filled the school district that serves Bridgewater. Since 1990, according to district figures, the student body has increased by more than half, from 5,179 to 8,704.
 Those increases mean that the district will soon be involved in no fewer than eight building projects, including the construction of a new elementary school and new gymnasiums and wings at other schools to accommodate the additional students.
 ''It's not easy, that's for sure,'' Walter Mahler, superintendent of the Bridgewater-Raritan Regional School District, said of the enrollment increases. From a budget standpoint, he said, ''we have to curtail everything we can aside from construction.''
 Dr. Mahler said that next year alone the high school figures to have about 170 new students. ''You do the math,'' he said. ''Think about the courses a child needs, how many hours a teacher can teach. We estimate we're going to have to hire 11 more teachers this year.''
 The esteem in which parents hold the district is both a compliment and a challenge for Dr. Mahler and other officials, who welcome the praise of parents of new students while trying to figure out where they're going to put them.
 And the district's growth looks to continue for at least the next several years, Dr. Mahler said. Students have been coming to the district is such great numbers that school officials have started adjusting the enrollment projections every six months. The latest projection indicates that the district's population will edge toward 10,000 students within the next four years.
 ''And those projections,'' Dr. Mahler said, ''they've been right on the money.''

Too Few Houses
 Money is, of course, key to the home-buying madness that currently reigns here.
 In fact, some agents said, the spike in prices that has driven prices up for the past few years in the area have accelerated even in the past few weeks.
 John Terebey Jr., a seller with ReMax of New Jersey based in Princeton, said that in the past few weeks alone prices have increased anywhere from 3 percent to 5 percent.
 ''Spring came in like a lion,'' Mr. Terebey said. ''Entry-level pricing is nonexistent in the Somerset, greater Mercer County area.''
 Homes that were being offered for $125,000 two years ago are now selling for $200,000 and more. In this market, entry level has risen to the $300,000 range, and few houses are available at that price. Mr. Terebey recently labeled one Internet listing for a ranch in Hillsborough with the heading: ''Great home in a hard to find price range!'' It was being offered for $319,000.
 Such shifts, Mr. Terebey said, have been frustrating for even the most optimistic shoppers. ''Most of our buyers are just numb,'' he said.
 Those with the temerity to buy often find themselves making tough choices, like deciding to buy outside of the area where they originally wanted to even if that means tacking on precious minutes to the daily commute.
 ''The farther east you go, the less you get for your dollar,'' said Cindy Czaskos, a Weichert seller based in Clinton. ''A lot of people, they're looking to go the extra miles to get more with their dollar.''
 For instance, Ms. Czaskos said, an additional 15 minutes of commuting time could mean a savings in the tens of thousands of dollars on a home's price.
 She, too, noted home prices that have increased exponentially over the past five years or so, with properties sometimes tripling in value. 
 ''It's been even crazier the last few years,'' she said. ''Some of us just look at each other'' she said of her fellow real estate agents, ''and shake our heads.''
 That was just about the reaction Andrew McElroy and his wife had when they first entered the market here a few years ago. And they leave it now, with the addition of their 8-month-old daughter, feeling much the same way.
 Once the sale of their home in Bridgewater is made final, the McElroys plan to move to Sussex County, at the northern tip of the state.
 Asked why they didn't choose to remain near their current home or somewhere else in Somerset County, Mr. McElroy answered without hesitation. ''The prices,'' he said. ''They're a little bit more than I wanted to pay.''

HEADLINE: Geezers, Gerries and Golden Agers

BYLINE: By GEOFFREY NUNBERG. 
Geoffrey Nunberg, a Stanford linguist, is heard on NPR's ''Fresh Air'' and is the author of the coming book ''Going Nucular'' (PublicAffairscq, 2004).

 BODY:
NOT long ago, when a 20-something New Yorker told me, ''I'm going to grandma's place in Florida to spend a week with the gerries,'' it took a moment to realize that the word was a truncation of ''geriatric.'' If you thought he was referring to Germans, he might have been referring to you.
 It's too soon to tell whether ''gerry'' will catch on. But it's normal for the generation that's coming of age to coin names for the one that's passing from center stage, not just in its slang, but in its official vocabulary as well. 
 Recently, the Progressive Policy Institute held a panel to promote its proposal for a Boomer Corps, a national service program for older Americans. The name was chosen to suggest a range of activities broader than those traditionally associated with retirees. But some people have worried that the connotations of boomer might become more derogatory as people over 65 come to constitute a quarter of the population, increasing the economic burden of Social Security. 
 It wouldn't be the first time that words for old people went from positive to disparaging. In the 18th century, ''gaffer'' was a term of respect for old people, most likely derived from ''godfather,'' and ''fogy'' was simply a word for a veteran; by the beginning of the 19th century both had become derisive words. Around the same time, ''codger,'' ''old guard'' and ''superannuated'' acquired pejorative senses, joined later in the century by new disparagements like ''oldster,'' ''fuddy-duddy,'' ''coot'' and ''geezer.''
 The historian David Hackett Fischer argued in ''Growing Old in America'' that those shifts reflected a dramatic change in society, as deference to the old was replaced by contempt and neglect. The difference is symbolized by a shift from the age-becoming fashions of the 18th century to the youthful ones of the early 19th century: powdered wigs and loose, full-cut coats and gowns yielded to diaphanous dresses for women and to toupees, tight trousers and high collars for men. 
 Age-disparaging words are the natural byproduct of a cult of youth, so it's not surprising that so many of them appeared in the Boomer Age. Since the 1950's, the language has added ''dinosaur,'' ''fossil,'' ''blue-hair,'' ''cotton-top,'' ''gerry'' and ''trog,'' as well as flip terms for parents like ''rents'' and ''p's.'' Gays speak of ''trolls,'' who hang out in bars called ''wrinkle rooms.'' And that's not to mention British imports like ''wrinkly,'' ''crinkly'' and ''crumbly,'' which together sound like a law firm out of ''Bleak House.''
 The circumlocutions and euphemisms people use when speaking of the aged are equally revealing. The Victorians coined expressions like ''of a mature age'' and ''70 years young,'' an expression first credited to Oliver Wendell Holmes. The 20th century brought ''senior citizen,'' ''golden ager'' and ''Third Age.'' The comparative ''older'' has become an absolute term, in a way that mirrors the development of ''elderly'' 350 years earlier -- when somebody talks about ''older Americans'' nowadays, no one asks, ''Older than whom?''
 Granted, many of those phrases reflect a new perception of age as an important social issue . However fulsome ''senior citizen'' may sound, it's the first term to acknowledge the old as a political constituency. But most of these euphemisms are too forced for everyday conversation. And even in politics and business, they're often replaced with more oblique phraseology. Banks have abandoned ''senior accounts'' for ''Classic checking,'' or ''Renaissance checking,'' and airline programs for older fliers go by names like ''Young at Heart'' and ''Silver Wings Travel Club.'' Euphemism is like waxing a floor -- you have to keep reapplying new coats as the old ones yellow.
 The condescension of our euphemisms and the impertinence of our slang both testify to our discomfort about confronting the facts of age head-on. As G.K. Chesterton remarked 80 years ago in his essay ''The Prudery of Slang'': ''There was a time when it was customary to call a father a father. ... Now, it appears to be considered a mark of advanced intelligence to call your father a bean or a scream. It is obvious to me that calling the old gentleman 'father' is facing the facts of nature. It is also obvious that calling him 'bean' is merely weaving a graceful fairy tale to cover the facts of nature.''
 True, these facts of nature leave every Western society a bit ill at ease. The British, French and Germans talk about the old with the same mix of irreverence and euphemism as Americans. But only the United States makes youth an essential feature of its national self-conception. As C. Vann Woodward once put it, we see ourselves as ''the eternal Peter Pan among nations.'' 
 The youthfulness of our generational language may make it even harder for us baby boomers to come to terms with our lengthening demographic shadow. Linguistically, though, we'll have to reap what we have sown. As Chesterton said of the young people of his own age, ''As they have no defense against their fathers except a new fashion, they will have no defense against their sons except an old fashion.''
