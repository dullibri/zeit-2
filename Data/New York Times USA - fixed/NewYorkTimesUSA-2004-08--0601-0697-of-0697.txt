HEADLINE: City's Infant Mortality Rate Jumped by 8 Percent in 2003

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
The infant mortality rate in New York City, one of the key indicators of the general health of the population, jumped by 8 percent in 2003, according to the city's Health Department.
 The increase came after several years of steadily declining rates and was caused mainly by a rise in infant deaths in New York's poorest communities. The overall infant mortality rate in the city is 6.5 deaths for every 1,000 newborns, below the national average of 7 per 1,000. 
 But certain neighborhoods are doing much worse than others. For instance, the Tremont section of the Bronx averaged 10.2 infant deaths for every 1,000 children born. Other neighborhoods with poor ratios included Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and Jamaica East, Queens.
 ''Any infant death is tragic,'' said Thomas R. Frieden, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. ''The Health Department is working closely with health providers and community partners to prevent infant deaths in all communities throughout the city, with a focus on neighborhoods with higher infant mortality rates. Though year-to-year fluctuations are expected, we are reviewing the pattern of infant deaths in 2003, particularly in areas where there were larger increases, such as the Bronx.''
 Manhattan continued to have the lowest infant mortality rate of the five boroughs, 4.8, while the Bronx had the highest, 8.6. 
 There are a host of factors that contribute to infant mortality rates, including the use of alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy, access to good medical care and the mother's economic status.
 The increase was due in part to the number of babies born prematurely and weighing very little. Newborns with a very low birth weight have much higher infant mortality rates and accounted for more than half of all the infant deaths in 2003, according to the Health Department.
 The overall city rate is based on the deaths of 807 infants and 124,345 live births in 2003. The year before, there were 742 infant deaths and 122,937 live births. Any child less than a year old is considered an infant.
 City health officials have set the goal of reducing the infant mortality rate to 5.0 by 2008. They have been working with community leaders and health care providers to increase the overall health care available to women, including prenatal care, help mothers stop smoking and warn them about the risks of drug and alcohol abuse.
 The department has also been focusing on educating women about family planning programs.
 To that end, the Health Department announced a new initiative this week, urging women to ''take control'' of their reproductive health. The campaign seeks to educate women about the different methods of birth control available and encourages them to select the one they feel most comfortable using.
 The campaign concentrates on the city's poorer communities and will include ads in the subways and on buses. One poster asks the question ''Which Woman Are You?'' and shows a group of women, each labeled with a different birth control method. The include the pill, the patch and condoms.
 Teenage pregnancy in New York has dropped in recent years but is still well above the national average, according to the latest data available.
 However, Mr. Frieden said that the majority of pregnancies in the city, of any age group, were unplanned, noting that infant mortality rates were higher when babies were born close together chronologically.

HEADLINE: Two Arrested In Alleged Bombing Plot

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
The police arrested two Brooklyn men yesterday who they said were plotting to set off a bomb in the subway station at Herald Square, law enforcement officials said last night. The pair were to be charged with federal crimes in connection with the plan.
 One of the officials stressed that the plot had no ties to the Republican National Convention, set to begin Monday at Madison Square Garden, a block away. He said that the men had set no time for the bombing, and had not obtained the explosives. The plot, the official said, did not get far past the discussion stage. 
 But the timing of the arrests was tied to the convention because of concerns about security at the Republican gathering. Few details could be learned last night of the alleged plot or the specific charges that were to be brought against the men. But one official called the men ''bumblers'' and said they did not appear to be members of any terrorist group and had no terrorist training.
 The official said the plan was uncovered because the two men, one 19 and one 20, discussed their desire to carry out an attack with an informant, who joined them in their plot and volunteered to get the explosives. The informant contacted the police. 
 The names of the men could not be learned last night, but one official said that they lived in Brooklyn and that one of the men was from Pakistan. The official described the men as ''zealots.''
 The men had said they wanted to carry out the attack to disrupt the United States economy, the official said.
 It was unclear how long the authorities had the men under investigation, how the two men met the informant and why they confided in him.
 The arrests come at a time when the city is at an extremely high level of security, with authorities aggressively investigating even the most minor reports of suspicious activity.

HEADLINE: Lessons of Najaf

 BODY:
Iraq's interim government did well to avoid a bloody fight to the finish with Moktada al-Sadr over the Imam Ali Mosque, the country's most sacred Shiite site. It could have suffered incalculable political damage even if it had won. Instead, Prime Minister Ayad Allawi accepted a face-saving compromise worked out by the country's leading Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, thus ending a siege that had occupied center stage in the war in Iraq for three weeks. 
 The main winners are Ayatollah Sistani and Mr. Sadr, a fiery but low-ranking cleric who is a hero to millions of poor, young and unemployed Iraqi Shiites. Baghdad and Washington, once eager to escalate this confrontation, exit from it somewhat diminished. Najaf, meanwhile, lies shattered, and hundreds of Iraqis, including many of Mr. Sadr's armed followers, have been killed.
 Significantly, it was with Ayatollah Sistani, not Dr. Allawi, whom Mr. Sadr worked out the withdrawal deal. The battered remnants of his Mahdi Army were allowed to leave the mosque without having to surrender or give up their weapons. They are now supposed to stay out of Najaf and the city of Kufa nearby, but similar agreements with the Mahdi Army have broken down in the past. And with Mr. Sadr now seen as a hero in the Shiite slums, he will have no trouble replacing his fallen fighters and building an even more powerful militia to advance his towering political ambitions and militant religious agenda. 
 The agreement also calls for all American and other foreign military forces to be withdrawn from Najaf and Kufa, to be replaced by Iraqi police, whose readiness and reliability remain untested. 
 Mr. Sadr is widely disliked -- by the Allawi government, by senior clerics and by the main Shiite religious parties. His growing influence threatens orderly constitutional development and secular rule. Yet again, he has demonstrated that he excels at turning military confrontations to his own advantage. In this he was assisted by Mr. Allawi, who tough-talked himself into a corner from which the more subtle Ayatollah Sistani extracted him. Mr. Allawi needs to digest important lessons about the limits of bluster and firepower in his volatile country, and move quickly, with American help, to find jobs for the angry unemployed men Mr. Sadr has been using as cannon fodder. 
 For its part, Washington now faces the prospect of seeing American forces banned from the Shiite strongholds of Najaf and Kufa, as well as the Sunni redoubt of Falluja. It therefore needs to make major adjustments in military and political strategy if it is to retain any hope of rebuilding Iraq and preparing for credible elections in five months.

HEADLINE: Markets Rise a Bit Despite Sluggish Growth of the G.D.P.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A sluggish gross domestic product reading was nonetheless better than expected, prompting investors to send stocks slightly higher yesterday.
 The economy's 2.8 percent growth in the second quarter was a revision from the 3 percent preliminary figure reported in July and a far cry from the 4.5 percent growth in the first quarter. The figure, however, was better than the 2.7 percent expansion economists had forecast. 
 That gave investors hope that this week's drop in oil prices could produce stronger economic growth for the current quarter. Still, with the Republican National Convention next week and traditionally slow trading in August, volume on the major markets remained extremely low, and any rising trend in stocks would be seen as tentative at best, analysts said.
 ''This is really anemic,'' said Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. ''That's letting a bit of volatility come into the market, but so far this week, it's been on the upside. So when everyone comes back in September, at least we'll be working in a slightly higher market.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.60 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,195.01. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,107.77, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 9.17 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,862.09.
 Consumer belt tightening was echoed in the latest consumer sentiment index reading from the University of Michigan. The index stood at 95.9 in August, down from 96.7 in July. Since crude oil prices pushed past $49 a barrel last week, however, prices have retreated, giving investors hope that consumers may start spending again. The October crude oil contract settled at $43.18, up 8 cents. 
 Investors also weighed a warning from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that the country would face severe hardships if Medicare and Social Security benefits to baby boomers were not curtailed.
 ''It's such a mix of news today, and that really doesn't help us out,'' said Scott Wren, equity strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons. ''There's no clarity in terms of inflation, with the oil prices and G.D.P., and there's really not much clarity in terms of earnings growth.''
 Chattem, maker of consumer health care and hygiene products, rose $1.34, to $30.26, after it increased its third-quarter earnings outlook and reduced its estimate of settlement costs related to class-action lawsuits over its Dexatrim diet pills.
 The microchip equipment maker Novellus Systems lowered its earnings and sales estimates because of low demand, prompting Lehman Brothers to cut its second-half estimates for the company. Novellus was nonetheless up 53 cents, at $25.18.
 The pharmaceutical company Chiron tumbled $4.08, to $43.41, after it said deliveries of flu vaccines would be delayed because of contamination issues. The news led two brokerage firms, Deutsche Bank and Robert W. Baird, to cut their ratings on the company.
 In the bond market, Treasury note prices were lower. The 10-year Treasury note declined 4/32, to a price of 100 6/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.23 percent from 4.21 percent on Thursday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32, to 105 6/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.02 percent from 5.01 percent.

 Re ''Not a Hooverville in Sight,'' by N. Gregory Mankiw (Op-Ed, Aug. 22):
 By focusing on the unemployment rate in his defense of the Bush administration's economic policies, Mr. Mankiw minimizes the importance of the deficit and the fact that almost 40 percent of that debt is held by foreign governments. He also doesn't mention the implications of our huge and rapidly growing trade deficit. 
 These twin 500-pound gorillas are apt to have a much more profound effect on the American economy than the current employment outlook.

HEADLINE: State of the Economy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, suggests that there are no data available on the quality of the jobs the economy is now creating (''Not a Hooverville in Sight,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 22). 
 Perhaps he should see the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which recently concluded that 57 percent of full-time wage and salaried workers who were displaced between 2001 and 2003 and had found new jobs by January 2004 were making less than they had at the lost job. 
 For one-third of these workers, their earnings losses were 20 percent or more.
 Is Mr. Mankiw unaware of his own administration's research, or is he afraid that if he scratches the surface of the economy he might find parallels to Herbert Hoover's America after all?

HEADLINE: WORKERS AT 4 BF GOODRICH PLANTS APPROVE CONCESSIONS

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Union workers at four BF Goodrich tire plants have approved concessions that will cut labor costs about 20 percent, saving the company $60 million a year. The United Steelworkers of America said yesterday that 70 percent of the 3,400 union workers at tire plants in Woodburn, Ind., and Tuscaloosa and Opelika, Ala., approved the pact, which runs through July 2006. About 1,000 union workers at a plant in Kitchener, Ontario, backed a similar deal on Monday. Officials at BF Goodrich's parent company, Michelin, said employees agreed to concessions on health care, pay and the work force. Michelin, which is based in France, said it agreed to pay a ''modest'' pension increase to keep pace with inflation and to pay $20 million to help about 9,000 United States retirees pay for increased health costs.

HEADLINE: Economic Squeeze Plaguing Middle-Class Families

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: NEWTON, Iowa 

 BODY:
Sure, she is upset that she cannot afford health care, and it hurts that higher tuition costs at the community college where she carries a full load have put her deeper in debt. But at the end of this month, Molly Illingworth will suffer the worst blow yet: she is getting laid off by her mother. 
 ''I hate to close the shop,'' says Pam DeBruyn, Molly's mother, who owns a small party and office supply store here, and also works full time as a graphic designer. She needs the designer job for the health insurance, so she will close the store, and with it will go her daughter's employment. 
 In this Iowa family, one generation is trying to step through the gateway to the middle class; the other is struggling to stay in it. And it is the middle-class squeeze -- rising college tuition and soaring health care premiums at a time when wages are stagnant and job creation is sluggish -- that may be the sleeper economic issue of the presidential campaign. 
 ''I feel the squeeze from both ends,'' said Beth Steenhoek, a mother of two who owns a small insurance agency in Newton. Fewer people are buying insurance, she said, because of a hefty increase in premiums, and her own family insurance costs have gone up as well. 
 Ms. Steenhoek has refinanced her home mortgage loan, and remembers getting ''about $400 a kid'' in the Bush tax cut, but she said it still feels like the family budget is shrinking. And she has not even thought of taking a few days off.
 ''A vacation? No, I can't leave the office.''
 For Ms. Steenhoek, the economy is the No. 1 issue in the presidential campaign. She is that rare species this election year: the undecided voter. But even solid partisans are troubled by the tremors at the edge of middle-class life. 
 ''I'm a pretty staunch Bush Republican and I have a great job at I.B.M.,'' said Todd Canny, who was sharing ice cream with his three children and wife in a new mall. ''But we're paying a lot more for health care co-pays and premiums, which is through my wife's job as a teacher. And trying to save for college for these three little ones has gotten a lot harder.''
 Senator John Kerry says the middle class has shrunk since President Bush took office, and when judged by the percentage of Americans who made $25,000 to $75,000 in 2003 -- 45 percent of households -- he is right, according to factcheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center that monitors campaign claims. Mr. Bush cites record home ownership and a rising investor class. He points to indicators of coming economic growth, and says his tax policies have put money directly back in people's pockets. 
 But despite low inflation, record home ownership and productivity, many middle-class households are close to a tipping point -- a bill or two away from losing economic control, surveys and interviews show. Even with the creation of a million new jobs over the last year, the percentage of people who say the economy is in good shape has fallen as Election Day approaches.
 [The number of Americans without health insurance rose to 45 million last year, up a million from the previous year, and median household income continued a three-year decline, the Census Bureau reported on Thursday. People in the middle-income brackets had the biggest declines in coverage.]
 Last year, 1.6 million American households filed for personal bankruptcy, up 33 percent from 2000, according to figures kept by federal bankruptcy courts.
 And if current trends hold, nearly one in seven families with children will declare bankruptcy by the end of the decade, said Dr. Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor who is the co-author of ''The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke'' (Basic).
 ''These people aren't poor,'' Ms. Warren said. ''But this is the first generation where college-educated people with a good job cannot find financial security.'' 
 But Ms. Warren said the squeeze goes beyond short-term economic swings, and is worse than it has been at any time since the creation of the post-World War II middle class. The reason is that the price of things that people cannot control, but need to get ahead of or stay ahead of, are rising much faster than inflation or wage increases. 
 With wages flat, college tuition is up an average of $1,207 for four-year institutions since 2000, and yearly health care premiums up $2,360 over the same period. Mr. Bush's advisers say the tax cuts have made up for stagnant wages. Real disposable income, money left over after taxes, is up slightly this year over last, and that is mostly because of tax cuts. 
 Another variable is gas prices. They have fallen some from recent highs, but record oil prices portend a winter when home heating fuel costs could break some family budgets. Already, higher gas prices have cost the average family about $500 a year.
 So even though people received additional money out of their houses, through low-interest rate refinancing, or in their pockets, through the federal tax cuts, the stimuli seem to have worn off. Nearly two-thirds of people in recent polls say they have trouble paying bills and feel pinched by the rising costs of middle-class essentials.
 It is one thing to feel the squeeze in Newton, a Maytag company town east of Des Moines where layoffs and outsourcing have had a ripple effect on businesses big and small. But it is quite another to hear people talk about the squeeze inside the polished marble shopping palace of the new Jordan Creek Town Center, Iowa's biggest mall. It had its grand opening this month in the booming suburbs west of Des Moines.
 The Cannys live near the mall, in the fastest growing part of Iowa, where big houses and new office parks have sprouted in former corn fields. 
 Mr. Canny said the Bush tax cut did not help his personal finances as much as the rising health care costs and the higher price tag for filling his S.U.V. tank hurt them. Mr. Canny has yet to give Senator Kerry, who used the term ''middle class'' eight times in his Democratic Party acceptance speech, a second look. 
 ''But if things continue to get worse, it may start to affect my vote,'' Mr. Canny said. 
 Iowa's seven electoral votes went to former Vice President Al Gore by a slim margin in 2000 and the state is up for grabs this year, according to polls. It is not only a swing state, but also emblematic of all the trends that have pressed middle-class Americans. 
 Ms. DeBruyn and Ms. Steenhoek, here in Newton, own their businesses. Both women have a spouse who also works. But both women feel they have lost ground because of costs they cannot control, costs of things that keep them among the overwhelming majority of Americans who say they are middle class.
 When Mr. Kerry said in his acceptance speech that ''People are working weekends, two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead,'' it went directly to the middle-class squeeze issue, and hit its mark in some households in Iowa. 
 ''I like some of what Kerry has to say on the economy,'' Ms. Steenhoek said.
 But both women also like President Bush's emphasis on trying to give tax money back to middle-class families. In Iowa a few months ago, Mr. Bush said the election ''is a choice between keeping the tax relief that is working, or putting the burden of higher taxes back on the working people.''
 Here in the troubled prairie town of Newton, the only way Ms. DeBruyn says she can keep her dream of owning a small business alive is by firing her daughter, whom she has been paying $6.50 an hour. Then she plans to move the business into her home and open it at night, while holding onto her full-time day job as well.
 ''I'd like to retire in this town,'' said Ms. DeBruyn, who has lived in Newton all her life. ''But it seems like we're holding onto less and less of what we make.''

HEADLINE: Warning Anew About Retiree Expectations

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 27 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, warned on Friday that the federal government might have to scale back promises to the elderly in programs like Social Security and Medicare.
 ''As a nation, we owe it to our retirees to promise only the benefits that can be delivered,'' Mr. Greenspan told a conference here sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
 ''If we have promised more than our economy has the ability to deliver to retirees without unduly diminishing real income gains of workers, as I fear we may have, we must recalibrate our programs,'' he said. 
 Mr. Greenspan has expressed similar views many times in the past, but he went further on Friday by warning political leaders that they cannot count on continued rapid rises in productivity and faster economic growth to solve the problems ahead.
 Economists have warned for years that retirement and health care costs will soar as the baby boom generation reaches retirement age and as the number of workers shrinks as a share of total population.
 Mr. Greenspan's message was almost equally uncomfortable for Democrats as Republicans.
 By implicitly calling for reductions in future benefits to the elderly, Mr. Greenspan attacked a basic tenet of Democratic vows to protect benefits come what may.
 But Mr. Greenspan conspicuously avoided any mention of the solution eagerly proposed by President Bush and many other Republicans: to partly privatize the Social Security system by letting people divert some of their payroll taxes to individual savings accounts that they would control.
 Noting that the share of the American population older than 65 will climb from 12 percent to 20 percent by 2035, the Fed chairman said the United States needed to increase savings, increase spending on education and maintain the pace of productivity growth.
 Heightened productivity growth of workers ''offers the greatest potential'' for allowing the country to support its aging population without lowering the overall standard of living, he said. 
 But higher productivity will require continued investment, and the United States' savings rate remains very low. Federal deficits, which have hit records under President Bush, have also depressed the national savings rate and increased the nation's need to borrow money from abroad.
 ''The decade-long acceleration in productivity and economic growth has seemingly muted the necessity of making such choices'' between reduced benefits or higher taxes, Mr. Greenspan said. But, he warned that ''history discourages the notion that the pace of growth will continue to increase.''
 If the population over 65 years of age doubles by 2035, he continued, federal deficits will substantially increase. 
 ''But how these deficit trends are addressed can have profound economic effects,'' Mr. Greenspan said. Increasing payroll tax contributions could make the problem worse, by possibly reducing the incentives for workers to continue working. 
 Without going into details, the Fed chairman said that benefit formulas could be adjusted so that entitlements to retirees in the future climb more slowly than they would under current law.
 ''Early initiatives to address the economic effects of the baby boom retirements could smooth the transition to a new balance between workers and retirees,'' he said.
 In an implicit attack on the new expansion of Medicare to provide some prescription drug benefits, which is expected to cost more than $530 billion over the next 10 years, Mr. Greenspan said policy makers ''must be especially vigilant'' to create benefits only when they can truly be afforded.
 Mr. Greenspan made his comments at the start of the Federal Reserve Board's annual economic symposium, which is devoted this year to the economic impact of global demographic changes.
 But the issue is also a backdrop to the presidential election campaign. President Bush and many Republicans are promoting the idea of replacing part of the traditional Social Security system with private savings accounts.
 The Democratic nominee, Senator John F. Kerry, has opposed such plans and has vowed to ensure that benefits are not reduced in the future.
 Neither candidate has addressed the long-term challenges in any detail. Most analysts say that the looming financial shortfalls of Social Security are relatively modest and can be addressed by incremental changes to benefit formulas and a gradual delay in retirement ages.
 The problems confronting Medicare are expected to be far more severe, because costs have been rising rapidly per person at the same time that the population of retirees has been increasing.

HEADLINE: Mayor Cites Dramatic Increase In Security Cost for Convention

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that New York City's elaborate security preparations for the Republican National Convention would cost between $60 million and $70 million, about twice what city officials initially expected a year ago.
 But the mayor said that much of that cost -- about $50 million -- would be covered by the federal government, leaving a final tab of between $10 million and $15 million for the city's taxpayers. 
 ''We originally started out projecting that the cost of security would be about $25 million, and that would be borne by the taxpayers of New York City,'' Mr. Bloomberg said on his weekly radio program on WABC-AM. ''That cost has, because of Madrid, multiplied dramatically,'' he said. 
 In March, train bombings in Spain killed 191 people.
 ''I think now it will probably be something -- $60 million, $70 million, $60 million, $65 million -- but we got $50 million, which we hadn't counted on from the federal government so the cost to the taxpayers of New York City will be $10 million or $15 million,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
 He said these security costs would also be offset by what he described as the ''enormous economic boom'' fueled by the convention.
 The event is expected to draw as many as 50,000 people to New York City, including 5,000 Republican delegates and 15,000 journalists. 
 The Bloomberg administration has estimated that the four-day convention, which begins on Monday, will add about $265 million to the local economy.

HEADLINE: His Style Built on Charm, Edwards Hones His Edge

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
If there was a moment that defined the campaign style of Senator John Edwards, it might have been at a rally last Monday in the city of La Crosse in far western Wisconsin, on the bank of the Mississippi River.
 A couple of hundred yards out in the river, a boat full of hecklers chanted, ''Four more years, four more years!'' Their shouts were all but drowned out by the noise of the several thousand people who had gathered on a gorgeous evening to cheer Mr. Edwards, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, and Mr. Edwards could easily have ignored the taunts. 
 Instead, he saw an opportunity. ''You all can't see it from where you are, but there's a boat in the river with Bush-Cheney posters all over it,'' he told the crowd with a grin. ''And you know what? It's going in circles.''
 The crowd erupted in guffaws.
 Running mates have traditionally served as the sharp-tongued point men for the men who would be president, and Mr. Edwards's mission this past week filled that role. From Virginia to Wisconsin to New Mexico, he condemned the television ads that have questioned whether Senator John Kerry really deserved his Vietnam war medals. ''Lies,'' he called them, declaring that they said more about President Bush's character than about John Kerry's.
 But Mr. Edwards's natural style is not the cutlass of Richard M. Nixon or the stiletto of Bob Dole. Instead, he excels at snatching an opportunity, weaving his own life's history into his speeches and capitalizing on endearing moments.
 In Racine, Wis., a grade-school boy shyly asked what could be done to help his grandmother, who had to pay a lot for her medicine. The crowd's affection for the child was almost palpable. ''I want this guy in one of our ads,'' Mr. Edwards said to laughter and applause.
 From there, he glided smoothly into the Bush administration's stance on prescription drugs for senior citizens, which he said enriched drug companies at the expense of Medicare pensioners. 
 A few days later in Cleveland, Mr. Edwards beamed encouragingly as a girl of kindergarten age gathered the courage to speak into a microphone. ''Can you save me from terrorists?'' she asked in a barely audible voice.
 ''Yes, darling, we're going to save you from terrorists,'' Mr. Edwards said with his megawatt smile. He paused just long enough to let the crowd savor the moment. Then, addressing the grown-ups, he dropped the smile and said the best way to battle terrorists was to build strong alliances ''so we can get at these people before they get at us.''
 Not that Mr. Edwards is slow to throw a jab when the opposition's chin is open. That was clear at a town meeting one evening at the Colorado state fairgrounds, just outside Denver, in a dirt-floor rodeo arena that smelled of sweet essence of horse. Someone brought up Vice President Dick Cheney's differences with the White House on same-sex marriage.
 ''I guess they forgot to tell him what to say,'' Mr. Edwards said, smiling. 
 A few days earlier, Mr. Edwards had sat with a pair of middle-aged men in a front yard near Charlotte, N.C. The event had been staged to let the men tell their stories of hewing to the American work ethic for decades, only to lose their jobs in a textile plant.
 The men were nervous, almost tongue-tied before a crowd of journalists and neighbors. So Mr. Edwards did what he had done so effectively as a trial lawyer, patiently drawing the men's stories out, word by word, alluding to his own father's years in a mill along the way.
 He seems to be able to handle potentially awkward questions. In southwestern Virginia, he was asked what ought to be done about the medical-malpractice suits that a questioner said were driving doctors out of the state.
 ''We have the best legal system in the world, but it's not perfect,'' Mr. Edwards responded evenly. Perhaps, he suggested, lawyers should be required to certify that their lawsuits are not frivolous, and be penalized if they are found later to be just that. (Despite President Bush's attempts to insinuate Mr. Edwards into the fraternity of frivolous-lawsuit lawyers, he made millions by winning many more cases than he lost.)
 Mr. Edwards generally sticks to his message, assailing the Bush administration on Iraq, the economy, health care, a tax system that Democrats say favors the rich. He often does a half-dozen local television interviews in a row, answering mostly the same questions. Somehow, he sounds as though he is answering each question for the first time. 
 One afternoon in Columbus, Ohio, he sat for a string of telephone interviews with reporters hundreds of miles away. He listened through his earpiece, sipping bottled water and waiting for his cue.
 ''Rabid skunks,'' Mr. Edwards said with a smile to a reporter and camera crew in the room, seemingly apropos of nothing. ''They're doing a rabid skunk story on TV right now,'' he added, describing the action he was hearing in his earpiece. Then it was his time to talk, yet again, about ''the issues that affect people's lives.''

HEADLINE: Economic Reality Bites

 BODY:
If anyone required further evidence that President Bush's fiscal policies have not worked the way he says they have, this week's report from the Census Bureau provided it. In brief, from 2001 through 2003, poverty increased, income stagnated and the ranks of the uninsured grew, while the United States spent some $400 billion on tax cuts, which mainly benefited wealthy families. The Bush administration seemed intent on minimizing the political impact of the report, releasing the data on Thursday, instead of the usual date in late September, to get it done before the convention. But the numbers spoke for themselves. Since Mr. Bush came to power, 4.3 million people have fallen below the poverty line, set at $18,660 for a family of four in 2003, bringing the total number of people living in poverty in 2003 to 35.9 million, or 12.5 percent of the American population. 
 The poor will always suffer most from recession and job losses. But one sure way to stem the slide into poverty is by bolstering state programs that directly benefit the poor, like job training, health care and child care. The administration devoted only 3 percent of its stimulus spending to aid for state governments. Congress and the administration have also done nothing to enhance the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. As a result, while the number of children living in poverty increased by 11 percent over the past three years, the number of children receiving welfare declined by 10 percent over the same period. Adding to the gloom, median family income -- $44,853 in 2000 -- fell by $1,535 during the administration's first three years, while the number of Americans without health insurance, according to the Census Bureau, grew by 5.2 million, to 45 million in 2003. The president and Congress have largely ignored this problem, while leaving little room to address it later by ballooning the deficit with tax cuts. 
 A Bush campaign official suggested that the census report was misleading because it did not reflect the economic growth of the past 11 months. In fact, the report covers all of 2003. And in three of the seven months of 2004 for which data is available, job growth has not been strong enough to even keep up with population growth. Moreover, a Commerce Department report released yesterday showed that economic momentum slowed in the spring, with the economy expanding at a rate of only 2.8 percent, the slowest advance in more than a year, versus 3.0 percent as originally reported. The downward revision reflects June's record trade deficit of $55.8 billion. 
 It remains to be seen whether this week's bad economic news turns out to be bad political news for Mr. Bush. But for tens of millions of Americans, it is already old news.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Expands Its Inquiry Into Interrogation Tactics

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL and DAVID JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
A Central Intelligence Agency review that grew out of the furor over abuses at Abu Ghraib prison now includes scrutiny of the agency's interrogation and detention practices at military-run facilities and other sites across Iraq, government officials say. 
 The reassessment, which is more far-reaching than previously known, could have implications for the agency's conduct elsewhere, including interrogations of high-level Al Qaeda suspects like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed who are being held by the C.I.A. in secret facilities around the world. 
 Former intelligence officials say that lawyers from the C.I.A. and the Justice Department have been involved in intensive discussions in recent months to review the legal basis for some extreme tactics used at those secret centers, including ''waterboarding,'' in which a detainee is strapped down, dunked under water and made to believe that he might be drowned.
 ''Policies and procedures on detention interrogation in Iraq and elsewhere have been the focus of intense oversight and scrutiny, and very close attention has been paid to making them lawful,'' a senior intelligence official said Friday. 
 Over all, the review by the intelligence agency, along with the investigations and corrective steps already undertaken by the military, reflect how the government has retreated from an aggressive posture adopted in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks on how far interrogators could go in questioning detainees. 
 Within the military in particular, some of the harsh procedures authorized until this spring were quickly suspended or abandoned after the extent of the abuses at Abu Ghraib surfaced in April. This week, reviews completed by two investigative panels have called for even clearer rules to be drafted for the military and intelligence agencies to require humane treatment during interrogation.
 Among the questions raised by the Pentagon reviews is whether intelligence agencies should be required to heed the same guidelines for interrogation as the military, or whether they should be permitted more latitude. A report by Maj. Gen. George R. Fay about the abuses at Abu Ghraib said the conduct of C.I.A. personnel at the prison was perceived by military officials there as more aggressive than that allowed by the military. The report said the C.I.A.'s conduct had a corrupting influence on military interrogators and contributed to a view among them that it was permissible to exceed strict guidelines for interrogations.
 Mark Mansfield, a C.I.A. spokesman, would say only that the agency's inspector general is conducting ''several'' reviews of the agency's conduct in Iraq. Mr. Mansfield said it had not yet been determined when the inquiries would be completed or whether the results of the probes would be made public.
 Among the reviews, intelligence officials say, are an examination of what a military investigation described as eight ''ghost'' detainees who were incarcerated at Abu Ghraib, but who were kept off the prison's roster at the C.I.A.'s request. In one of those cases, in November 2003, a detainee brought to the prison by C.I.A. employees but never formally registered with military guards died at the site, and his body was removed after being wrapped in plastic and packed in ice.
 The man had been detained by Navy Seals, who had hit him in the head with a rifle butt during his arrest, and the military investigation said that blow apparently led to his death. But the investigation suggested that the detainee might have survived if he had been screened by doctors, as would have been required had he been properly registered with the military.
 The reviews have stirred concern in intelligence and military circles by officials who fear that decisions to forbid all coercive interrogation techniques could cost the United States valuable intelligence. A senior Army official, discussing new rules adopted by the military in a briefing for reporters on Wednesday, said the restrictions had damaged efforts to obtain information.
 ''Interrogators and detainees both know what the limits are,'' the official said. ''They know that if the United States captures them, they will get a medical exam. They'll get their teeth fixed. They will get essentially a free physical and they will be released if they don't talk after a certain amount of time.''
 In interviews in recent days, some current and former intelligence officials have warned of the danger of showing too much deference to detainees who espouse extreme anti-American views.
 ''Let's keep in mind what the objective is -- to get information that will save American lives,'' said a senior intelligence official. ''And there is an absolute necessity to use effective interrogation to gain insights on plans to kill Americans.''
 Interrogations of suspected Qaeda figures including Mr. Mohammed, regarded as the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, have been described by the independent commission that investigated those attacks as having provided rich and important information about terrorist operations. Intelligence officials have not spelled out in any detail the kinds of interrogation tactics used on Mr. Mohammed, but they have expressed concern that he has successfully resisted their efforts to extract information.
 An April 2003 C.I.A. report on Mr. Mohammed that is cited in a footnote to the Sept. 11 commission's report refers in its title to Mr. Mohammed's ''Threat Reporting -- Precious Truths, Surrounded by a Bodyguard of Lies.'' 
 In recent weeks, current and former officials say, the debate about interrogations and about Mr. Mohammed in particular has been conducted against the real and urgent backdrop of concern about a potential new terrorist attack.
 Mr. Mohammed's knowledge of Qaeda personnel has become significant again because of his association with the suspected Qaeda figure known as Issa al-Hindi, or Dhiren Barot, who was among eight men arrested early this month in Britain and later charged with terrorist related offenses. The authorities believe that Mr. Hindi traveled to New York in 2000 and 2001 to conduct surveillance operations at five financial institutions in New York, New Jersey and Washington.
 In the Sept. 11 commission's final report, Mr. Mohammed is said to have told his interrogators that he dispatched Mr. Hindi, under the name Issa al-Britani, to case potential economic targets in New York.
 It is not clear whether Mr. Mohammed was talking about the same reconnaissance described in surveillance reports that the authorities found in Pakistan last month. But those surveillance operations are important because they were behind the Bush administration's decision, announced on Aug. 1, to elevate the threat level in the three parts of the United States.
 It remains unclear whether intelligence officials have adopted newly aggressive methods in their interviews of Mr. Mohammed.
 It has been known that, after the abuses at Abu Ghraib were disclosed, the Justice Department abandoned some legal opinions written in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks that had been used as the basis for the broad latitude allowed interrogators in using extreme procedures against suspected Qaeda detainees. In recent months, government lawyers said the legal opinions were too broad and were being rewritten to restrict the harshest interrogation measures.
 The broader inspector general investigation into the agency's involvement in detention and intelligence in Iraq since May 2003 was ordered in May by George J. Tenet, who was then director of central intelligence. But additional questions about the C.I.A.'s practices center on a small number of high-level suspected Qaeda detainees being held by the agency outside Iraq in undisclosed locations around the world.
 The C.I.A. has already scaled back some coercive methods used against detainees, although officials would not discuss specific techniques. Agency officials have demanded advance Justice Department approval for each tactic used against detainees and a new legal analysis of federal laws on the subject, including a statute that makes it a felony for American officials, including C.I.A. employees, to engage in torture.
 One seminal document repudiated by the government was an August 2002 memo by the Justice Department. It concluded that interrogators could use extreme techniques on detainees in the effort to prevent terrorism. 
 The memo suggested that the president could authorize a wide array of coercive interrogation methods in the campaign against terrorism without violating international treaties or the federal torture law. It did not specify any particular procedures but suggested that there were few limits short of causing the death of a prisoner.
 While the memo appeared to give the C.I.A. wide latitude in adopting tactics to interrogate high-level suspected Qaeda detainees, it is still unclear exactly what procedures were used or the extent to which the memo influenced the government's overall thinking about interrogations of other terror detainees captured in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Welcome to New York. Now Go Hail a Cab.

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:

Memo to: Republican convention delegates
Re: Getting around Manhattan
 You saw the movie, you memorized the song, so let's skip the bit about the Bronx being up and the Battery down. What you need to know is the best way to get around.
 On the town in New York, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 to 1, you will find that many of the people riding in that government-run hole in the ground do not agree with your politics. So live it up. Reward free enterprise. Take a taxi. (If you had hoped to ride an elephant to Madison Square Garden, sorry, you missed your chance. The annual pilgrimage of pachyderms into Manhattan, through the Queens Midtown Tunnel, takes place in the spring, just in time for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus.)
 As a novice cab customer, you will find that, as with many urban rituals seen in the movies, more is involved in the act of taking a taxi than you thought. To smooth the bumps in your big-city commute, here are tips to let you run up the meter like a native:

Q. How will I know if a cab is available?

A. Squint. Look for the light on the roof with the taxi's medallion number, a four-character combination of three digits and one letter -- 4D70, for example. You will also see the word ''off'' to the left of the number and the word ''duty'' to the right. When a cab is available, only the medallion number will be illuminated. When a taxi picks up a passenger, the medallion light -- which is connected to the meter -- goes out. Opening the door and climbing into an occupied cab is a bad move. The passenger inside may think you are a mugger; things could get ugly.
 When a taxi is not available -- when it is on the way to the garage, say -- the driver will turn on the off-duty light and can refuse to pick you up (though most will anyway, if you are going in their direction).
 New Yorkers whine that taxis are never available when it is raining; some drivers do take the day off in bad weather. Taxis also seem to disappear around 4 p.m., which is shift-change time -- day-shift drivers are on their way to Queens or Brooklyn to turn the cabs over to their night-shift counterparts. The city's solution, which took effect in May, was an economic incentive: a $1 surcharge from 4 to 8 p.m. 

Q. How do I make the driver see me?

A. Be statuesque. Step off the curb -- maybe not so far that you risk catching a ride on the bumper, but enough to get attention. Stick your arm into the air. (Think of John Travolta in ''Saturday Night Fever.'') Or head to 47th Street and Park Avenue, where there is a statue of a man showing how it's done.

Q. So how much will a taxi ride cost?

A. Whatever the meter says, plus a tip if you are feeling generous. Rates went up 26 percent in May to $2.50 for the first one-fifth of a mile and 40 cents for each one-fifth of a mile beyond that. The meter adds extra charges for waiting time or rides at night or during the evening rush.
 The bottom line? A typical cab ride of 2.6 miles -- from SoHo to Midtown, for example -- with five minutes of waiting time in traffic costs $8.30.
 And the tip? ''The etiquette says 15 percent,'' said David Pollack, a driver who is executive director of the Committee for Taxi Safety. But he said passengers often tip more if he charms them with his wit.

Q. As a Republican, I'm no limousine liberal. But it's not the limousines that I find objectionable. Why doesn't New York have Mercedes-Benz taxis like the ones in Europe?

A. In the 1990's, New York did. But a spokesman for the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission said the one and only Mercedes owner-driver eventually ''went black-car.'' That is taxi-speak, and it means more than that the owner-driver repainted his yellow Mercedes. A ''black car'' is a type of livery vehicle that generally picks up passengers who have called a dispatcher, not people hailing a car on the street. Black-car drivers say they run less risk of a stickup because most black cars take credit cards or vouchers, not cash.

Q. What will I be riding around in?

A. Most New York cabs these days are Ford Crown Victorias, rear-drive sedans that share parts with the Lincoln Town Car, and a growing percentage of these are stretched versions with six inches more legroom than a regular Crown Vic. A few Ford Explorers are doing duty as taxis, along with several minivans: the Toyota Sienna, Isuzu Oasis and Honda Odyssey, among others.

Q. How many miles are on the Crown Vic that just passed me by?

A. In the slalom course that is New York, where there are bathtub-size potholes and Kamikaze bicycle messengers to be dodged, regulations guarantee that drivers will be older than their cabs. You will not see any fleet cab older than a 2001 model. Fleet cabs tend to be driven 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Cabs driven only one shift a day can go five years before being retired. Every taxi is inspected every four months.

Q. Is it safe in there?

A. Most of the time. Only a few taxi passengers wear seat belts and most live to hail another cab. Mouth guards might offer more protection. Tom Glavine, the Mets pitcher, was in a taxi accident near LaGuardia Airport a couple of weeks ago. He lost two front teeth and had to have stitches for a cut lip. So a taxi did what professional sports did not. Remember,Glavine once said that he chose baseball over hockey because ''I had all my own teeth and I wanted to keep it that way.''

Q. What if my driver gets in a spat?

A. Pipe down. If your driver double-parks, don't argue with any agents who appear out of nowhere. He may end up with a ticket. You may end arrested like Mike Wallace, the CBS News correspondent, who began questioning enforcement agents from the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission when they questioned his double-parked black-car driver on Aug. 10. Last week, the commission dropped the disorderly conduct charge against Mr. Wallace and said one of its agents had acted ''somewhat overzealously'' in arresting him.

Q. If I leave valuables in the car, will I ever see them again?

A. You will if you are Yo-Yo Ma and the item you forgot is a cello valued at $2.5 million. In 1999, the police tracked down the taxi and retrieved Mr. Ma's cello -- still in the trunk -- in time for his evening concert.

Q. Should I tell the cabby that I'm a delegate?

A. Maybe not. Some drivers don't like your candidate. This has nothing to do with the Iraq war, the economy or blue-state bias. They say President Bush does not feel their pain. ''When President Clinton came into New York City, he would apologize for the traffic he caused,'' said Mr. Pollack of the Committee for Taxi Safety. He recalled picking up a fare, a woman on the way home from the hospital after surgery, on the day President Bush gave a speech at the United Nations. The trip turned into a 90-minute ordeal as the passenger's pain medications wore off. ''It doesn't make the traffic any better if the president apologizes,'' Mr. Pollack said. ''But at least he's acknowledging the situation.''

Q. Where are all the Checker cabs that I see on television?

A. The Checker Marathon was the slab-sided mishmash of 1950's styling that dominated New York's streets long after it was discontinued in 1982. The last Checker taxi in New York, a 1978 model, went out of service in 1999 and was auctioned by Sotheby's for $134,500.
 The Checkers that rumble by in prime time are not real taxis and are not licensed to pick up paying passengers. They are essentially props, rented by Hollywood producers.

Q. The last time I was in New York, didn't I hear Catwoman in a cab?

A. That was Eartha Kitt, who growled as she signed off the recorded message the city required in every cab starting in 1995. As a Republican delegate, you may not like government regulation any more than taxi passengers liked having celebrities telling them to buckle their seat belts (at the start of a ride) and to take their belongings and get a receipt (at the end). The city dropped the requirement last year.

HEADLINE: 2 Charged With Plotting To Bomb Train Station

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
Two New York City men were charged yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn with conspiring to set off a bomb in the subway station at Herald Square, law enforcement officials said.
 The men, who were identified in court papers as Shahawar Matin Siraj, 22, of Queens, and James Elshafay, 19, of Staten Island, 19, twice conducted surveillance of the station, including once last week, drawing diagrams of the entrances and exits, the officials said.
 But Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and other officials stressed yesterday that the men had obtained no explosives and had set no specific time for any attack, and that it was unclear how far their plans had actually progressed. A news release announcing the arrests said they were not connected to earlier intelligence that Al Qaeda was seeking to attack financial targets in New York before the election. 
 The officials also said they did not believe the plot involving the station, at 34th Street and Avenue of the Americas, was timed to coincide with the Republican National Convention, which opens tomorrow at Madison Square Garden, a block away.
 ''There was no timeline, they had no explosives, they were under surveillance,'' Commissioner Kelly said. ''There's a lot of people concerned because of the level of hatred that's out there.''
 Last September, a paid police informant began having conversations with the two men, and about eight months later, Mr. Siraj began talking to the informant about setting off bombs in the New York City area and ''doing harm to United States military personnel and law enforcement officers,'' according to a complaint filed yesterday by federal prosecutors. It provided no details about the informant or how he met the men.
 The complaint did say that the informant, at the instruction of law enforcement officials, told the two men he was a member of an Islamic ''brotherhood'' that had approved their mission. The brotherhood, according to the complaint, did not exist. 
 During some conversations, the men ''at times stated that they wanted to cause economic harm and disruption but that they wanted to avoid killing anyone.''
 But in tape-recorded conversations with the informant this month, both men can be heard repeatedly discussing plans to plant bombs on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and in subway stations, according to the complaint, and Mr. Elshafay had drawn a map of the bridges and police precincts on Staten Island. 
 The complaint also says that at one point Mr. Siraj declared he was ''ready for jihad,'' and that in another taped conversation, Mr. Elshafay declared his hatred of ''Zionists'' and expressed ''solidarity with the Palestinian people.'' 
 ''This is an investigation that started about a year ago. This was managed by our intelligence division,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''Siraj had been making increasingly militant statements about damaging public facilities, specifically transportation facilities.''
 Mr. Kelly added that ''backpacks were obtained with the intent of putting explosives in the backpacks.'' He said other subway stations, at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street and at 42nd Street, were also discussed as possible targets.
 The police arrested the two men on Friday, and they were arraigned yesterday morning on federal charges in connection with the bomb plot before Kiyo Matsumoto, a federal magistrate judge, who ordered them held without bail on charges that they conspired to use explosives to destroy a building. 
 Mr. Siraj, who studies computer networking in Queens two days a week, came to the United States from Karachi, Pakistan, about five years ago, said his uncle, Saleem Noorali, owner of the Islamic Books and Tapes store on Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Mr. Noorali said his nephew worked in the bookstore six days a week from 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
 ''When would he have time to do these things?'' Mr. Noorali said, referring to the charges. ''It's false information. I don't see any evidence.''
 Mr. Noorali was standing outside the courthouse with Mr. Siraj's father, Siraj Abdul Rehman, who also works at the bookstore. In broken English, Mr. Rehman said his son was innocent.
 Mr. Elshafay's mother left the courthouse in tears, pursued by reporters. Without giving her name, she denied the charges against her son, saying: ''We're proud to be Americans -- that's all I can say.''
 The arrests come at a time of heightened concerns across the city because of the Republican convention.
 Although one high-ranking police official said the men were not linked to Al Qaeda or any known terrorist group, he said they were nonetheless representative of disenfranchised young Muslim men in the city who had become more radical by listening to sermons preaching jihad.
 The official said such men were as capable of violence as organized terrorist groups. ''What we have to be looking for is an organized attack like 9/11, but also disenfranchised people who are equally capable of committing violent acts,'' the official said, citing the Egyptian immigrant who shot and killed two people at an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport in 2002 and the English teacher from Gaza who went on a shooting rampage on the Empire State Building observation deck in 1997, killing a Danish tourist and wounding six other people. The man left behind a letter revealing his seething anger at the treatment of Palestinians by the United States, Israel and other countries.
 Yesterday, Robin L'Hussier, 35, a legal secretary from Queens, was waiting with two friends for a train at the Herald Square station. 
 ''What scares me is what we don't know,'' she said. ''What hasn't been uncovered.''

HEADLINE: Shop, Walk, Work and Protest

BYLINE: By LISA KELLER. 
Lisa Keller, an associate professor of history and director of the journalism program at Purchase College of the State University of New York, is writing a book about public order in 19th-century New York and London.

DATELINE: Purchase, N.Y. 

 BODY:
IN 1790, while New York City was still the capital of the United States, the first Congress passed the Bill of Rights, affirming our basic liberties as a free people: ''Congress shall make no lawabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.''
 The concept is simple, but the practice is complicated. In fact, there hasn't been an unlimited right to assemble in New York City for 130 years. 
 The current controversy about where protestors can demonstrate during the Republican National Convention, which kicks off tomorrow, is just the latest manifestation of a conflict that has been dividing the city for more than a century. In most big cities, it is difficult to find places to parade or to protest without interfering with the rights and needs of other residents. In New York City, where traffic, crowds and commerce are particularly intense, it is a near miracle that any kind of large public assembly is ever held. We demand to have our say anywhere and any time on any subject (particularly when we don't like something), but we also want to be able to shop, walk, work, travel and eat without disruption. 
 After the Civil War, New York became one of the first cities in the nation to require permits for individuals and groups seeking to use streets and parks for assembly or marches. Bitter lessons had been learned from the 1863 Draft Riots, which left more than 100 people dead and turned the city into chaos, and the 1871 Irish Orange Riots, which left more than 40 dead. The city decided it would allow public assembly only in controlled circumstances.
 The sources for that control lay not in the courts but with the city's municipal authorities -- mainly municipal agencies, politicians, police and influential citizens' groups -- representing a broad class, ethnic and religious spectrum. Their agenda was to keep order in the city, allowing it to function without economic disruption and preventing violence and loss of life.
 The timing of the decision to require permits in the early 1870's was no accident. Socialists, trade unionists and unemployed workers sought to redress economic and political grievances on city streets, and looked across the ocean to the model set by Londoners, who had seized Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park as the seats of vox populi. 
 The New York solution was a compromise reached after trial and error. It allowed some parks to be used, but changed that decision after excessive wear and tear. After the 1874 ''Blood or Bread'' melee in Tompkins Square Park, the city closed down the square as a site of protest for many decades. 
 However, in 1896, when a neighborhood association complained about the noise and disruption from Italian street parades, the police turned a deaf ear -- the parade organizers had legal permits. City authorities concluded that if they could control circumstances by setting clear conditions for meeting times and places through the permit, then disturbances to public peace, injury to individuals and interruptions to traffic and commerce could be avoided, while still allowing free assembly. Each permit request was individually determined, but no place and no time frame was ever absolute or guaranteed for public assembly. 
 The public during this period in the late 1800's had little legal recourse if denied a permit except to take to the streets and face arrest. 
 The turbulent 1920's and 1930's saw a proliferation of demonstrations and marches and much more debate over public assembly. In 1941, Robert Moses, who was parks commissioner at the time, banned a protest in Union Square Park, which prompted the New York Civil Liberties Committee to charge that he was changing city policy about demonstrations, misinterpreting the law and abridging the right of free speech. Citing a Supreme Court decision, Mr. Moses responded that the right to use a park was not absolute, especially if there was a likelihood of riot or fatalities. It was an old policy, he reminded the committee, and the city had usually managed to accommodate requests for public meetings.
 In 2004, a persistent fear of terrorism has added a new wrinkle to the long conflict between freedom and order in great cities. But we must remember that democracy is messy and that free speech is meaningless if we can only shout at 500 empty acres. We must accept the likelihood that some people will be late for work, some people will miss dinner, some grass will be trampled and some people will sit in snarled traffic. The founders of our republic knew that freedom and convenience did not go hand in hand, and they knew the consequences of limiting the right of assembly. 
 If we lose the right to speak our minds in Manhattan this week, then the city won't be worth the $24 that the early Dutch settlers allegedly paid the Indians for it in 1626.

HEADLINE: When Beauty and Value Are in the Beholder's Eyes

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
FOR Michael A. Moses, the Will Barnet painting that hangs in his Greenwich Village living room is not just a lovely, if melancholy, work by a respected American artist. It's also an investment and, by his reckoning, a good one. 
 Professor Moses, who teaches management at New York University, figures the painting has appreciated about 13 percent a year since he and his wife bought it about a decade ago. 
 That is more than just guesswork. He has spent four years studying the value of artwork, and he and Jianping Mei, an N.Y.U. finance professor, have devised an index that tracks the value of art sold, mainly by the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses in New York. Their index includes more than 13,000 transactions going back to 1875. 
 In 2002, they published a report on the index in the American Economic Review. By their calculations, the value of art has kept pace with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the last 50 years, though art's returns have zigzagged more. ''For people who have a 20- to 30-year horizon, I have no problem talking about art as an investment,'' Professor Moses said. 
 His view is not an orthodox one. Other people with knowledge of financial matters and collectibles are far less convinced of the investment potential of art, antiques, fine wine and rare coins. 
 To be sure, collectibles can appreciate and command high prices. Witness the $104 million paid in May for a Picasso painting, ''Boy With a Pipe.'' But they differ from other investments in important ways. They can be hard to sell, and the brokerage fees can be relatively high, compared with those for, say, an index mutual fund. And they can be costly to store and insure. 
 Most important, they do not lend themselves to diversification, unless the collector is rich. A company like Microsoft can be divided into shares and sold in tiny pieces, but most works of art can't be split apart. No one has devised an art mutual fund, though Professor Moses said several art trusts were being developed to allow people to share ownership of a group of works. 
 One scholar, Wayne R. Guay, an accounting professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has questioned whether, from an economic perspective, the value of collectibles should rise over time. 
 ''Stocks and bonds go up in value because they're priced at the present value of their future cash flows,'' Professor Guay said. ''An antique isn't going to generate any earnings or throw off any cash. Stocks and bonds do. The only way you're going to make money on an antique is selling it to someone who likes it more than you do.'' 
 In other words, the value of a collectible -- Professor Guay collects wine -- represents little more than the whims of enthusiasts. (Granted, one could say something similar about many stocks peddled during the Internet bubble.)
 Like Professor Moses, Tyler Cowen is both an academic and an art aficionado. He teaches economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and collects Mexican paintings done on amate, or bark paper. 
 Professor Cowen figures he has spent more than $100,000 on art, including his roughly 200 amate paintings, since the early 90's. If he had to liquidate his collection tomorrow, he said, he suspects he would get only about half his money back. 
 ''There are only so many buyers for a given set of works, and they're not all sitting ready to spend money on you,'' he said. 
 What's more, collectors often fool themselves about the value of their beloved collections -- and tend not to be disciplined about selling works when they can get the best price. ''This is one of the paradoxes of art collecting,'' he said. ''If you wish to deal successfully, you have to be involved and detached at the same time.'' 
 Sometimes, collectors wrongly assume that a dealer's appraised value represents what buyers are willing to pay.
 ''There's always somebody who will value an asset,'' said Timothy M. Hayes, a financial planner in Pittsford, N.Y., who collects photographs. ''But you still can be stuck with something that no one else wants.'' 
 CONSIDER a photograph Mr. Hayes bought recently. He saw it -- a black-and-white landscape shot around 1905 -- in a gallery about 15 years ago. He couldn't afford it at the time, but after searching for years, he found a print again in 2002 and bought it for $450. ''I bet nobody would bid if I put it on eBay,'' he said. ''It's a beautiful photograph, but the photographer, Joseph T. Kieley, isn't well known.'' 
 When dealers sell such a work, they typically get a bigger cut than brokers who sell stocks and bonds, said Jeffrey E. Daniher, a Cincinnati financial planner and coin collector. Markets for collectibles tend to be small and inefficient, he said, and dealers have often incurred high costs for storage and insurance they want to pass along to buyers.
 Expertise may also matter more than for stocks and bonds, Mr. Daniher said. An investor who doesn't want to spend time learning about stocks can choose an index fund. A collector must learn as much as possible -- or risk being duped. 
 ''When I was a kid, I bought a buffalo-head nickel that was supposedly in great condition,'' he recalled. ''I paid $600. When I went to sell it, I found out that it wasn't one of the nicest ones. It was only worth $75.''
 Collectors have more to fear than misrepresentation, he said. The coin market, for example, ''is thin, and it can be manipulated.'' A dealer may run want ads anonymously seeking the very kind of coin he is trying to sell, to make it seem more desirable. 
 From an investment perspective, wine and some fragile collectibles, like old manuscripts, may be especially risky. A wine collection can occupy a lot of space, and that space has to be temperature- and humidity-controlled, said Stuart H. Brager, a Baltimore physician and wine collector. Dr. Brager spent about $15,000 to convert his basement into a cellar for his 3,500 bottles.
 If that is not enough to scare away an amateur, Dr. Brager pointed out that even the most cellar-worthy bottle has a finite life. Eventually, it has to be drunk. ''And when you pull the cork, the asset's gone,'' he said. 
 Then again, wine does have a benefit that stocks and bonds lack. ''When my WorldCom stock went sour, I didn't have anything but a piece of paper,'' Dr. Brager said. ''If the market for wine takes a downturn, I've still got the wine to drink.''

HEADLINE: Officials Unraveling Woes of Texas Schools

BYLINE: By LAURA GRIFFIN

DATELINE: HUTCHINS, Tex., Aug. 26 

 BODY:
While other pupils around the state settled into the routine of classes, many Wilmer-Hutchins High School students spent their first week back at school sitting idly in the cafeteria, playing dominoes and taking naps.
 Their long-dilapidated school, unusable since it was flooded in summer storms, has become a symbol for what is being called the worst school district in the state. Five of the district's seven schools are in such bad shape that a state report recommends tearing them down.
 Now, Texas education officials are trying to determine how the district's financial situation deteriorated to the point that even with a $500,000 loan this summer, it could not afford to meet payroll for some of its teachers and staff members this week. 
 A grand jury looking into allegations of corruption in the district, which serves a mostly disadvantaged area five miles from the gleaming Dallas skyline, returned no decision this week but left the case open for further inquiry.
 Cedric Davis, the Wilmer-Hutchins school district police chief, took the accusations of wrongdoing and graft to the Dallas County district attorney's office this summer.
 ''They've mismanaged funds, and they're in the hole,'' Chief Davis said. ''Where'd that money go? It's not in the buildings or the students or the teachers.'' On Monday, the Texas Education Agency will begin an audit to determine what it will take to save the district. In connection with that audit, state health officials will inspect the schools for environmental and safety concerns, including air quality.
 ''They receive sufficient funds for operating a fairly well-achieving district,'' said Dr. Ed Flathouse, associate commissioner for finance and compliance at the education agency. ''But when you look at other districts, on the whole Wilmer-Hutchins comes up short every time.'' 
 Most agree something has to be done.
 No matter what happens, education officials say the 2,902 children in Wilmer-Hutchins schools are paying the price.
 ''Teachers and others may lose jobs, but a whole generation of youngsters in that district may be lost,'' Dr. Flathouse said. Superintendent Charles Matthews did not return repeated phone calls, but the Wilmer-Hutchins school board president, Luther Edwards, said the problems were caused more by decades of racial inequity and a lack of growth in the area than by the actions of the board or the administration. 
 Ninety-five percent of the students are black or Hispanic and 63 percent are economically disadvantaged.
 ''When they talk about mismanagement and poor leadership, why is it that it always happens in predominantly minority school districts?'' Mr. Edwards asked. ''It's a shame that in 2004 we're still grappling with the same thing -- racial tension -- but indirectly now.''
 But using race as an excuse offends some other African-Americans in the district. All along, they say, it has been a leadership issue. Chief Davis says that district money has paid salaries of people who did not work, contracts that should have been put out for bid but were not and for improper travel and phone expenses by trustees. 
 He also claims that the district illegally used federal money intended for instruction to pay bills, and he hopes to get the Justice Department involved.
 When Chief Davis took his accusations to district officials, he said, they retaliated by disbanding his department. He and officers have sued for wrongful termination, and a judge, granting a temporary injunction, reinstated the entire department.
 ''I'm angry that the kids have to go through this mess,'' said Chief Davis, who graduated from Wilmer-Hutchins in 1985 and whose daughter is a senior there. Mr. Edwards, the board president, also blamed a lack of financing from the state for the district's woes. But Wilmer-Hutchins gets more state and federal money than any other district in Dallas County. 
 Mr. Edwards also said he hoped voters would pass a $68 million bond package in September so work on the schools can begin.
 Turmoil in Wilmer-Hutchins goes back decades. In the 1990's, the district had four superintendents in less than five years and the state stepped in for two years in the latter part of the decade because of low student scores and money problems. 
 Johnny Brown, now DeKalb County superintendent in suburban Atlanta, ran the district during part of that time when test scores, school ratings and finances improved.
 ''All children can learn and excel, given the proper environment,'' he said. ''What's required of the adults is not rocket science -- it's to provide a quality education. I believe in local systems taking care of their own, but there are times, and this is one of them, that the state needs to step in.'' 
 It is not that easy, according to the state education agency. A school district must receive the lowest performance rating for two consecutive years before the agency can take it over. Wilmer-Hutchins is currently rated ''acceptable'' over all, despite low test scores among middle school and high school students.
 ''This district has a record of having the lowest to next-to-lowest rating,'' said Debbie Ratcliffe, a spokeswoman for the state agency. ''Right now, they're O.K. on that front, so that makes it difficult. But we can impose sanctions if there are financial problems.''
 Across the country, good school districts share a commonality -- their communities demand accountability and results.
 That has not happened in Wilmer-Hutchins. Historically, few people have participated in matters concerning the schools, local and state educators said.
 This time it is different, said Brenda Duff, P.T.A. president for the high school and Chief Davis's mother.
 ''They haven't demanded anything in the past, but I do see some changes coming,'' Ms. Duff said. ''The community's upset.''
 Many parents are trying to figure out ways to change districts, short of moving. And students say they are embarrassed.
 ''I'm afraid to claim this school, since it's the worst,'' said Reavis Skinner, 14, a freshman.
 A week before school was to start, the district announced that storm cleanup of the high school would delay classes for a week. 
 To Chief Davis, that storm was heaven sent -- without it, the problems may have gone unnoticed.
 ''The storms just enhanced a problem that has existed for a long time,'' he said. ''I think it was an act of God to bring this thing down.''

HEADLINE: Markets Extend Gains as Oil Prices Start to Cool

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks rose last week as the price of oil dropped almost 8 percent, to $43.18 a barrel, and a peace agreement was arranged in the Shiite holy city of Najaf in Iraq.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 84.87 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,195.01, posting a gain for a third consecutive week. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also had its third weekly gain in a row, climbing 9.42 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,107.77.
 Boeing and Honeywell, both up 3 percent, led the Dow's climb, while Apple Computer, which rose 11.5 percent, and Hercules, a specialty chemical maker that gained 10.6 percent, led the S.&P. 500 higher. 
 The Nasdaq composite index rose for the second consecutive week, gaining 24.08 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,862.09, led by Flextronics International, a provider of electronics manufacturing services. It rose 11.9 percent.
 Google fell in its first full week of trading. From a high on Monday of $109.40, Google dropped 3 percent by the end of the week, closing at $106.15 on Friday. The stock was still well above its debut price of $85. 
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was at 4.23 percent, unchanged from the two previous Fridays, though not far from its lowest level since spring. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

HEADLINE: The Street Of No Return

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
Unified commercial strips are a hallmark of New York. There is the diamond district on West 47th Street and Restaurant Row on West 46th Street, and down on the Bowery, a series of storefronts offer all manner of lighting supplies. It stands to reason that it makes economic sense to dedicate a strip to that most final of purchases, the funeral. 
 In Chinatown, on Mulberry Street, between Bayard and Worth Streets, a kind of death row has sprung up; one narrow block is home to no less than three funeral homes, two flower shops, a monument maker, a coffin company and, most recently, a store that sells the incense and paper items burned in traditional Chinese funerals. 
 At the southern end of the street, like sturdy trunks from which the various businesses have sprouted, stand two of the funeral homes, Wah Wing Sang and Chinese Cheung Sang. Gordon L.W. Wong, the funeral director at Wah Wing Sang, said his business dated back 50 years and was the first on the block, followed by Cheung Sang and then NG Fook Funeral Service. As a mark of Wah Wing Sang's stature in the community, the so-called Godfather of Chinatown, Benny Ong, was laid out there in a widely attended ceremony in 1994. 
 Sensing a built-in clientele, the ancillary businesses (flower shops, gravestone makers) have followed the funeral homes' lead. Last fall, when the longstanding Italian restaurant Giambone closed, a coffin company moved in. The cottage industry came full circle in May with the addition of the Hing Tao Company. The tiny store sells incense and other ceremonial items like fake money and paper houses, which are burned at Chinese funerals so the deceased will have a place to live and money to spend in the afterlife. 
 For many years, the funeral homes were the main source for all the trappings of mourning, but Mr. Wong appeared unconcerned about the recent competition. ''We do a volume business,'' he said. 
 Which leads to odd juxtaposition for those who live and work on the block. Funerals take place all day long, and hearses and black Town Cars clog the street. The sidewalk is sprinkled with loose flowers. One resident described the unsettling feeling of eating lunch at Sam's Deli and seeing a new arrival being taken into a funeral home. 
 On one recent afternoon, a bell began to clang in front of Wah Wing Sang, and a coffin was loaded into a waiting hearse. Karl Gluck, walking to work nearby, stopped to watch. The funeral procession, he said, usually winds through the streets of Chinatown before driving on to the cemetery. 
 Had seeing so many funerals taught him anything about the ritual? ''The more important the person, the more black cars,'' he said. ''I don't know if that's true, but that's my observation anyway.''

HEADLINE: Their Political Odyssey

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
LIKE many political candidates, Vinny Ignizio is immaculately dressed but poorly fed, accustomed to eating on the run. So it was not surprising one afternoon a few weeks ago to find the scrubbed, compact 30-year-old, who is running in a tough Republican primary on Staten Island for a state Assembly seat, sitting in his grandmother's curio-filled living room in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, in a suit and tie, waiting for a pizza. 
 Nearby, his 55-year-old mother, Camille, discussed her own political loyalties. ''They're going to do what's right for the country,'' she said of the Republicans, her Brooklyn accent unmistakable despite 31 years of living on Staten Island. 
 Besides running in a Republican primary, Mr. Ignizio has served as the chief of staff for two Republican councilmen from Staten Island. For her part, Ms. Ignizio is a member of the Richmond County Republican Committee. The pair, who plan to vote for President Bush in November, are clearly among that minority of New Yorkers -- only 13 percent are registered Republicans -- who will feel right at home when the party's national convention starts tomorrow. 
 At the same time, these steadfast Republicans are heirs of a family with strong Democratic roots, a family populated by factory workers, ardent trade unionists and a Democratic state officeholder. In her youth, Ms. Ignizio marched in rallies for John F. Kennedy, hung out in the Democratic headquarters in Bensonhurst, and listened to union lore at her mother's knee.
 A series of complex forces propelled this New York family on their long political journey, forces that sound many of the major themes of New York and even national politics and have been traced in works like Samuel G. Freedman's 1996 book, ''The Inheritance: How Three Families and America Moved From Roosevelt to Reagan and Beyond.''
 For the Ignizios, as for so many families, one theme is that the power of Democratic ideals often diminishes as new generations succeed their immigrant forebears. Another is that Staten Island, where Camille and her husband moved in 1973, is the city's center of Republicanism. Yet another is that individual and sometimes random life experiences, from the woes of sweatshop life in the 30's to the burden of double-digit inflation in the 70's to the stench of a landfill in the 90's, are powerful shapers of personal politics.

Rooted in the Unions
 This family chronicle begins with Ms. Ignizio's mother, Mary Palmieri, long before Camille was born, at a time when Staten Island was mostly farmland. It was 1933 and Mary, a dark-eyed, rail-thin teenager, had moved with her family to Bensonhurst from a cold-water flat in Carroll Gardens. Now a chatty 83-year-old, she shed no tears over the move. ''That was a slum,'' Ms. Palmieri said of her former neighborhood. 
 During the war years, when factories were desperate for labor, Ms. Palmieri worked in the garment district. Her older sisters had told her horror stories about factory work. ''My oldest sister didn't have hours,'' Ms. Palmieri recalled. ''You just kept working until whatever hours they called for.'' There were no bathroom breaks, her sisters told her, and no lunch breaks or paid vacations.
 By the early 40's, unions had changed much of this. The International Ladies Garment Workers Union was at the height of its power, benefiting from tough new labor laws and close ties to the White House. ''If you had any problems,'' Ms. Palmieri said, ''you had someone in the place that took care of you.'' When a worker fought with her bosses, the union swooped in. No one knew what went on in the conferences that ensued, but the worker usually came out fine.
 In return, the union made its own demands. Ms. Palmieri anticipated some of them -- paying dues, participating in strikes -- but others caught her by surprise. In 1939, she and her coworkers were told to attend the World's Fair because someone important wanted it to succeed. ''You had to go,'' she said. ''Not,'' she added acidly, ''that they paid for it.''
 But she didn't resent the union urging its members to vote Democratic. ''To secure our jobs, we had to do it,'' Ms. Palmieri said. ''Otherwise the union would go down the drain.'' Individual candidates mattered little to her. ''We all said to each other, 'You better vote for Joe Schmo.'''
 In those years, when Bensonhurst was a Jewish and Italian neighborhood, Italian-Americans like Mary lived mostly in one- or two-family detached houses in the heart of the area. And like the Jews who lived in the apartment buildings along the elevated tracks, they had strong ties to the powerful Brooklyn Democratic machine, which delivered 65 percent of the borough vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944. 
 In 1946, at a wedding, Ms. Palmieri met Danny Composto. Mr. Composto, a barber, was a Republican; he felt that Roosevelt had ''instigated'' the Japanese, and he nursed a grudge against the president for sending all his customers off to war. 
 Despite the couple's political differences, a courtship ensued. They were married in 1947, and in 1948 they had a daughter whom they named Camille and raised in Bensonhurst, in an apartment on quiet 79th Street, where they still live today.

Inflation Whips Camelot
 Camille was skinny like her mother, and a tomboy, fond of playing stickball with her younger brother. When she was 12, Kennedy was running for president, and Camille felt, as she put it, ''swept away.''
 ''Issues, who knew about issues?'' she said. ''Eisenhower was an old man to us. Everyone got into Kennedy and Camelot because they were young and vibrant.'' 
 Mr. Composto and his daughter, decked out in her political buttons, used to clash over politics at the dinner table. To his chagrin, Bensonhurst in 1960 was even more Democratic than it had been two decades earlier, so much so that the Democratic club was a hangout for neighborhood children. 
 Family ties as much as neighborhood ethos drew Camille to the Democrats. Her grandfather's cousin, Frank Composto, had been a state assemblyman, a state senator and a State Supreme Court judge, all on the Democratic line. ''Here we had a relative who was a politician,'' Camille said. ''Seeing his posters around, I think that's what made me register as a Democrat. My mother used to say the Democratic Party was for the working people, so that made me proud.''
 Though her father wanted her to go to college, Ms. Ignizio went to work as a typist and switchboard operator at Manufacturers Hanover Bank, on 49th Street in Manhattan. She loved it. ''Most of us were 19, 20 years old, and there were some recently married people. Everybody would kid around with each other.'' 
 At a cousin's college graduation party, she met Vince Ignizio, and they saw each other often during the long subsequent summer at Manhattan Beach, when all of Bensonhurst seemed to be stretched out on beach blankets. One day Camille's cousin called, saying, ''One of my friends wants to ask you out on a date.'' Camille was cautious. ''Which one?'' she demanded. 
 Two years later, in 1970, Vince and Camille were married in St. Bernadette's Roman Catholic Church, on 83rd Street in Bensonhurst, where Camille had been baptized and confirmed. Camille was 22, Richard Nixon was president, and the nation was entering a recession in which 600,000 people in New York State alone would lose their jobs by year's end.
 When Vince met Camille, he was working on the paving gang at Kennedy Airport. By the time they married, he had been promoted to operations agent at the airport, helping to oversee everything land-bound, from luggage trucks to runway repair crews. If a plane crashed during takeoff or landing, Vince was often the first on the scene, sometimes dodging pieces of flying metal. ''I saw a lot of dead bodies,'' he said. 
 But despite Vince's promotions, money was tight, for these were the years of double-digit inflation. ''We couldn't afford a house in Brooklyn,'' Camille remembered, ''especially in Bensonhurst. It was too high out here for us. We tried Long Island, and the taxes were too high out there.'' 
 Finally, the couple settled for a semi-attached three-bedroom in Eltingville, on the South Shore of Staten Island. It was cheap and, importantly for Vince, close to all three major airports. Staten Island at the time was almost rural, only opened to mass colonization a decade before via the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The island had so few stores, Camille went to Bensonhurst every week to buy groceries. 
 With her husband working nights and studying for a bachelor's degree during the day, Camille was lonely. She was left at home with her daughter, Theresa, born in 1971, and her son Vinny, born three years later. ''Those were hard years,'' she said. ''I'm not going to lie.'' She remembers the Christmas morning Vince got held up at the airport, where he had worked the Christmas Eve midnight shift. Unwilling to start the holiday without him, or even to let the children glimpse their presents, Camille kept them in bed until 11 a.m. ''I said, 'Let me go down and see if Santa Claus is here.' Then I said, 'Don't you want some oatmeal?'''
 As a young mother at home, Camille had time to watch the news, a habit she had picked up from Vince, who liked to shout at the television set during the evening broadcast. In 1979, with the annual inflation rate at 11 percent -- double what it was on her wedding day -- Camille began to develop a distaste for President Jimmy Carter. ''You start becoming conscious of things when you're raising a young family,'' she explained. ''Money gets tight, and you start putting your situation together with what's going on in the world.'' She was depending heavily on her credit cards to buy clothes for the children, and there was never enough money for family outings. 
 Camille was also disgusted with her country's weakness abroad, such as the botched rescue of American hostages in Iran in 1980. ''When the idiots went in there and tried to get them out with those stupid helicopters,'' she said, ''they all crashed into one another and they ended up killing more soldiers.'' She started to ask herself: ''Why is the country in the mess it's in?'' 
 The answer, in her eyes, was Mr. Carter. Outside, watching her children play on the lawn, Camille used to argue about politics with her neighbors, some of them unionized city workers and staunch Democrats. ''They thought Jimmy Carter was for the people,'' Camille said. ''Rosalynn Carter runs around the White House in curlers, and all that.'' Camille, by contrast, considered the president wishy-washy.
 In 1980, she voted for Ronald Reagan, the first Republican presidential candidate she had ever supported. Her husband went through a similar change of political heart, and so even did her mother, the onetime champion of unions. ''When Reagan came along,'' Camille said, ''you knew he wasn't going to take any nonsense from anybody.'' 
 Camille has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1980. Once, she believed that the Republicans were the party of the rich; after Reagan's election, she felt ''the Republicans were helping the people'' by cutting inflation. ''That helped us a lot,'' she said, ''because in those days it felt like we were always behind the eight ball.''
 In fact, like many Americans, she grew to adore Reagan. When the hostages in Iran were released, she stood in her living room and screamed with joy. Vinny, a boy of 6 when Reagan was elected, remembers being allowed to stay up late for his speeches. ''The whole house stopped,'' he recalled. 

Life in 'The Forgotten Borough'
 Vinny was a wild child; ''If you'd been my oldest child,'' his mother used to tell him, ''you'd be my only child.'' Growing up in the 70's and 80's, he had a country kid's childhood, playing with friends in the woods and riding bikes along makeshift trails. They gave little thought to the local political issues that consumed their parents, like the Staten Island secessionist movement and the Fresh Kills landfill, which aroused considerable fury. (Vinny did know about the existence of the landfill, which was two miles from his home. On summer nights, when the wind blew the wrong way, he would ask his mother to turn on the air-conditioner because his room stank.) 
 By 1981, when Vinny was 7, his father had become a supervisor at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's downtown heliport. Vinny got to hang around helicopters and the celebrities they transported, like former Mayor Edward I. Koch and former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, currently the chairman of the Sept. 11 commission. When these grandees emerged from beneath the rotors, they'd ruffle Vinny's hair before settling into their limousines. Former Gov. Mario Cuomo liked to heft Vinny onto his shoulders. ''Subconsciously,'' Vinny said, ''I thought: 'How wonderful it would be to be those people. How proud my mother and father would be.'''
 Politics ranked low among Vinny's interests in high school, but he was absorbing Staten Islanders' conservatism and their antipathy toward the Democrats running the city, who they felt had slighted the borough. When he was a student at Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J., he found himself arguing politics with a fiercely liberal professor. ''The professor would say, 'The poor people of the world are held down by the rich people,''' Vinny recalled. He would reply: ''I don't believe that. My dad started out literally sweeping airports.'' The professor responded: ''When you have your own class, you can hand out whatever you want to. Or on your own, you can be an activist.'' 
 Vinny took the suggestion. In his junior year, he joined the Richmond County Republican Committee, and began working on campaigns on Staten Island. He was particularly taken with Vito J. Fossella, now a congressman. ''Vito had just won the City Council, and Vito was young,'' Vinny recalled. ''I thought, 'Hey, young guys are getting involved.''' Soon after graduating from college, he became chief of staff for Stephen J. Fiala, a Republican councilman from his own South Shore neighborhood, whose campaign he had managed. Today, he holds the same position in the office of Mr. Fiala's successor, Andrew J. Lanza.
 Four years after Vinny went to work for Mr. Fiala, the Fresh Kills landfill officially closed. Vinny's eyes widen at the memory. ''I honestly thought it would never close,'' he said. ''When I went to college, people would say: 'Where are you from? Oh, Staten Island. That's where the garbage is.'''

Still Afloat, Still Republican
 Sitting in a pizzeria near City Hall in late July, Vinny ticked off the indignities visited upon Staten Island by Democrats. First, the dump. ''It just kept expanding and expanding under Democratic regimes,'' he said, until it was closed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki. Then the infrequent visits of Mayor David N. Dinkins. ''He never hid his disdain for our borough.'' Then the scarcity of services like express buses and sewers. ''To some people, that's foreign,'' Vinny said. ''You know, 'What do you mean you don't have sewers?' Well, when you're the forgotten borough, you're last on the list.''
 It is voters who share these feelings who have made Staten Island New York's most Republican borough. Staten Island is 37.8 percent Republican; the next most Republican borough, Queens, is only 18.1 percent Republican. 
 As Vinny talked, the fellow sliding a pizza into the oven recognized him. ''How's Staten Island?'' he asked. ''Doing good,'' Vinny said with a practiced air. ''Still afloat.'' 
 Vinny has had plenty of chances to work on his banter recently. He is in a three-way race for the Republican nomination in the South Shore's 62nd Assembly District, extraordinary for a party that seldom needs to hold primaries in this largely Democratic city. Every night, Vinny and his wife of eight months, Letizia, who is also a Republican, go from house to house, introducing themselves to the neighbors. ''We'll do anything to get him elected,'' said Letizia, an aide in the county clerk's office.
 If they succeed, Camille's family will have a striking way to measure its political journey. Vinny will be sitting in the same Assembly chamber where his great-grandfather's cousin once sat. But he will be across the aisle, on the Republican side.

HEADLINE: When Renovation Is Spelled R-e-s-p-e-c-t

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
MAX FRIEDMAN and Tom Romich are revolutionaries when it comes to New York City real estate. Describing the work they've done on their 1834 Greenwich Village town house, they use words like ''patience'' and ''respect'' -- shocking notions in an age of frenzied, instant and total renovation. 
 ''You can't barrel in and impose yourself on a house,'' said Mr. Friedman, who is 51 and a partner in the real estate division of the Pillsbury Winthrop law firm. ''You have to live in it a while, and be patient.'' 
 Patience he knows: as counsel to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, Mr. Friedman has been involved in the two decades -- that's four mayoral administrations -- of Times Square's redevelopment. 
 Mr. Romich, 56, director of institutional advancement at the New York School of Interior Design, said: ''You have to let the house speak to you. It's only by living in a house that you understand where the light is, for example, and how it changes as the seasons change.'' 
 This is why the renovation of their Federal-style row house, which they bought in 1993 for just over $1 million, is only now complete, the result of no hodgepodge of improvements nor agonizing dismantling but a mindful grand design, created by the architect Andrew Freireich and his associate, Adam Platt, about five years ago and acted upon two years ago (the contracting firm was Broad Channel Builders). 
 Counting Mr. Friedman and Mr. Romich, there have been just four owners in the last century, and each tenancy resulted in various embellishments -- zigs or zags in the house's stylistic history -- all of which the two wanted to acknowledge and archive in their renovation. 
 In the 20's and 30's, a lawyer and his wife, a sculptor, were in residence. A glorious, ur-Greenwich Village rooftop studio, with a massive, peaked skylight-cum-roof, was their grandest contribution. (At the Buildings Department, Mr. Friedman found a permit request from this period, for a hoist to cantilever out over the street from the studio, the better to get art in and out. It was denied, he said.) They also threw in a ''modern'' master bathroom, with that era's totemic salmon American Standard fixtures. 
 To Mr. Freireich's amusement, this was saved and relocated to the third floor, and tiled in an abstracted form of the traditional basket-weave pattern. ''It was important enough to someone in the 1930's, so . . . '' Mr. Friedman said, his voice trailing off. 
 He'll show you the little late 19th-century marble sink in its cupboard in his third-floor office, and say in the same apologetic tone, ''It's kind of idiotic, but somebody went to the trouble of putting it in, so we restored it.'' 
 In the 1950's and 60's, the house was owned by a glassmaker-turned-prominent-art-collector and his wife, who was the sister of a prominent sculptor. 
 ''I read somewhere that the house was 'the epicenter of the Greenwich Village art world,' '' said Mr. Friedman, who described the puzzling furrows and channels they found in the house's wall-to-wall carpeting (now long gone). They realized quickly these were the marks from that sculptor's installations. 
 A midcentury-modern chandelier of colored glass cylinders was mostly smashed save for two cylinders. They've refashioned one, in bright turquoise blue, into a single hanging light in the center of the parlor floor. Both eyed it quizzically the other day, pondering whether the white one, now lying fallow on the marble mantel -- an 1860's addition -- might look more appropriate. 
 Do not be fooled into thinking this archival approach has resulted in a four-story version of Miss Haversham's attic. ''What we did was restore where possible,'' Mr. Freireich said, ''recreate where appropriate and reinterpret when necessary.'' 
 Mr. Romich said, ''What we did was let the light back in.'' 
 Like most town houses in New York, this one was a collection of little rooms on many floors. On the ground and parlor floors, the various owners had pushed out a wall here, or covered up a window there, so the jumble of small spaces was even more pronounced. 
 Mr. Freireich's design became a kind of excavation. He opened up the space on both floors and connected the floors at the back with a broad interior staircase. He used detailing and color to extend the feeling of space and marry the different levels.
 The ground floor is laid with Portuguese limestone, which Mr. Platt reconfigured in umpteen ways to make the pattern break just right around the landings, the stairs and the hearths, and also to echo the shape of the bluestone they'd harvested from the garden and repaved half the yard with, and the slate slab sidewalk on the street side. ''It was a scale thing,'' Mr. Freireich said. ''There were all these elements that had to work together and that took a fair amount of doing.'' 
 Though the house had had its Beaux-Arts period and its Deco stage, it was its Federal beginnings that Mr. Freireich reached back for: a light bright aesthetic that nods to the neo-Classical. Some details were historically accurate, like the new wide white pine planks on the parlor floor. 
 ''We found plywood under the wall-to-wall carpet, and underneath that were the remnants of the parquet floor from the 30's, and underneath that were the original pine planks,'' Mr. Friedman said, explaining that the pine was scarred with nail holes from the parquet. These were planed off and recycled onto the third- and fourth-floor hallways. Other details, like the simple cornices over the bank of French doors at the back -- arrayed to match the six-over-six mullioned windows they've added, a landmark detail in modern, double-glazed form -- were more conceptual than historical. 
 ''Those are no style,'' Mr. Freireich said. ''Those are my 'appropriate' style.'' 
 There are relics of the house's earlier lives -- ''the footsteps on the stairs,'' as Mr. Friedman said -- that have not found their way into the public spaces. One snowy day seven years ago, they were cleaning out a cupboard upstairs when they came upon a large metal object that looked remarkably like . . . a grenade. They debated a bit, and finally called in the bomb squad, which confirmed that this particular souvenir was, in fact, authentic. 
 ''Our block was in lockdown for four hours on the coldest day of the year,'' Mr. Romich said, ''which was when we learned what great neighbors we had. They said, 'Come inside and have some coffee while they take care of your bomb!' '' 
 Samantha, their adopted standard poodle, arrived two years ago. A suburban dog, she was slow to master the stairs, which she now takes three risers at a time. 
 Mr. Romich comes from five generations of Ohio farmers and grew up in the house that's been in his family since 1872. Mr. Friedman, whose parents met in Siberia, was born in Paris and raised in Brooklyn. They have been together for 24 years; this is the second house they've restored. Their backgrounds couldn't be more different, Mr. Friedman said, or more similar. ''I think we each have a sense of the value of simplicity,'' he said. ''And a respect for what has preceded us, and brought us to this place.''

HEADLINE: The Rising Appeal (and Falling Cost) of Term Insurance

BYLINE: By CARLA FRIED

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to life's priorities, protecting one's family falls in the priceless category. And because of increased competition, the actual price for term life insurance has dropped by half in a decade. For $40 or so a month -- about the cost of a cup of coffee a day -- a healthy 40-year-old male can buy a policy that will pay $500,000 if he dies within 20 years.
 And cheaper means more popular. Term policies accounted for 22 percent of the $11.8 billion in total premiums paid by individuals in 2003, up from 13 percent in 1993, according to the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association. But those figures do not capture the new dominance of term insurance because term premiums are much lower than those for other types of life insurance. 
 The drop in term premiums, fueled in part by consumers' ability to comparison shop online, is spurring increased demand among new customers as well as policy holders jumping at the chance to switch to less expensive policies. Five years ago, Joseph Frawley Jr., a retired police sergeant in Cambridge, Mass., bought a 20-year policy with a $1 million death benefit that cost $550 a month. That high premium reflected a bout with melanoma and a history of cancer in his family. 
 ''It was an onerous cost,'' said Mr. Frawley, who now operates his own corporate security firm, Eastern Security Inc. 
 Working with AccuQuote, an online service that compares insurance policies, Mr. Frawley, 52, recently got a new 20-year, $1 million policy for $330 a month. 
 Term insurance is the most basic form of life insurance. It provides coverage for a fixed period; if the policyholder dies in that time, the beneficiary collects the benefit. At term's end, the policy has no value. By contrast, with far more costly universal life and whole life policies, the beneficiary receives the payout whenever the policyholder dies. Such policies include an investing component, known as the cash value. 
 J.Robert Hunter, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America, said term was the logical choice for most people, once they understand its sole purpose. 
 ''Life insurance is a bad name,'' he said. ''It should be called insurance to protect against the economic consequences of premature death. If that goal is made clear, then all you need is a sufficient amount of coverage for a specific period of time.''
 Mr. Hunter had term policies with a combined death benefit of $2 million while he was raising his six children. Now that they are grown, Mr. Hunter, 68, no longer has life insurance.
 Unlike universal or whole life policies, which remain difficult to decipher, it is easy to compare prices when shopping for term insurance. Web sites like Insurance.com,Insure.com, AccuQuote.com and Term4Sale.com provide price quotations from a basket of insurers. Or, an independent agent or fee-only insurance adviser can do the shopping for you.
 An insurer will use your personal data to determine your risk profile, much the way a mortgage lender uses your credit rating. Though each insurer has its own system, there are generally three broad categories: standard, preferred and preferred plus (for the lowest-risk, healthiest policyholders). 
 As insurers look for ways to bolster the bottom line, some are tightening qualifications for the least-expensive categories.
 ''The price you are first quoted is not the same as the price you may end up qualifying for,'' said David Mendels, who runs Creative Financial Concepts, a financial planning firm in New York. Between that initial quotation and a final offer, your medical records will be scoured. If you want a death benefit of $500,000 or more, the insurer is likely to require a blood sample. The higher the benefit -- and your age -- the likelier the insurer will demand a full medical exam.
 ''Even superhero marathon runners may have a hard time qualifying for the best rates,'' said James Van Elsen, a consulting actuary in Pella, Iowa, who advises insurers. He said that while 30 percent of an insurer's pool might have previously qualified for the best rates, he believed that as few as about 10 percent might make the cut today. 
 Byron J. Udell, chief executive of AccuQuote, said that anyone who was bumped down from preferred plus to preferred could face a 25 percent premium increase. A standard policy can be at least double the rate of preferred plus. 
 Ten years ago, for example, a 40-year-old man, 6 feet tall and weighing 230 pounds, might have qualified for the best rate. Today, however, a 40-year-old man would need to weigh no more than 200 pounds or so to get the lowest premium. Insurers are also looking more closely at cholesterol readings. A decade ago, a count of no more than 240 with a cholesterol-to-L.D.L. ratio of 6.5 or lower could snag the best rate. Now you often need a count of no more than 205 and a ratio of 4.5 or less. L.D.L., or low-density lipoprotein, is the kind of cholesterol associated with heart disease.
 Genetics can be important, too. The health histories of your siblings, as well as those of your parents, are now part of the analysis. The onset of a serious disease in a family member is enough to boot you out of contention for the best rate.
 Your performance behind the wheel is another factor. Some insurers now charge a higher premium if you have more than one moving violation. 
 ''Knowing which companies are tighter or more lenient on certain issues is the key to ultimately getting the best policy,'' Mr. Udell said. ''Not all underwriters have the same rules, and it's impossible for a consumer to know what those guidelines are.'' 
 Buying the right amount of insurance, of course, is also important. David Barkhausen, a fee-only life insurance adviser in Lake Bluff, Ill., says people tend to underestimate their family's financial needs and buy too little insurance. A conservative approach, he said, is to buy enough insurance to allow the beneficiary to live off the interest income from the death benefit, and not have to touch the principal. For example, if you assume an annual return of 5 percent, you should buy insurance equal to 20 times the annual income you want to replace. 
 ''But if you have built up other assets, you can use a smaller insurance amount,'' Mr. Barkhausen said. 
 Another factor is the length of time your beneficiaries will need that income. Do you have toddlers and want to provide for their education costs through graduate school? Or are your children finished with school? 
 Glenn Daily, a fee-only insurance consultant in New York, recommends that his clients spend $149 for the ESPlanner software (esplanner.com), which produces a personal financial analysis.
 The goal, experts say, should be to have the insurance in place until you have other assets -- pensions, Social Security, retirement funds -- that can cover your expenses. 
 A NEW strain of term insurance, called return of premium, is getting mixed reviews. The pitch is that if you are still alive at the end of the term you will be repaid all your premiums. But those premiums can be more than 30 percent costlier than a standard policy, and you don't get the money back until the end of the policy -- and you get nothing if you let the policy lapse. 
 Mr. Udell at AccuQuote.com says such policies can make sense for someone who doesn't like the idea of paying for insurance and getting nothing in return. ''With basic term insurance you only get paid if you die; this allows you to get something back if you in fact survive the policy.'' But, he added, you must consider carefully whether you could do better investing the difference in premiums on your own, and whether you have the resolve to keep paying the premium for the entire term.
 Some critics dismiss these policies as marketing ploys. ''I'm just skeptical of anything where I have to tie up my money for that long a period,'' Mr. Daily said. 
 Joseph M. Belth, professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University and editor of The Insurance Forum, a newsletter, said: ''It's a gimmick. You don't buy insurance to get money back. You buy insurance to protect your family.''

QUICK READ
For peace of mind when buying term insurance, know the terminology.

GUARANTEED LEVEL TERM
Refers to a constant level of premiums over time. But make sure that the guarantee lasts the entire term of the insurance; a 10-year guarantee on a 20-year policy exposes you to premium shocks halfway into the term.

CONVERTIBILITY
Allows you to convert a term policy to a permanent one. But keep track of when the provision expires; don't expect the insurer to follow up. Ask what permanent policies will be available.

RIGHT OF RE-ENTRY
This clause in some policies refers to your right to get more insurance once the original term expires. Find out the terms of re-entry. You don't want to have to qualify again.

INSURER FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING
Your policy is basically an investment in the future of the insurance company - specifically, its ability to pay your beneficiaries. One expert recommends that you choose an insurer with high ratings from three of the five rating firms: A. M. Best, Fitch, Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Weiss. Most insurance agents and Web sites have this information.

HEADLINE: If Minimum Wage Rises, Will Anyone Notice?

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
EXACTLY how much do Long Island's lowest-paid workers earn? Or, to put it more bluntly, how little?
 The federal government says the answer either way is $5.15 an hour. That's the minimum wage, and it tallies up to $206 a week, full time. Can anyone survive on that in Nassau or Suffolk? 
 Anecdotal evidence, including comments made by employers, business groups and entry-level workers, suggests hardly anyone does or needs to. The de facto Long Island minimum hourly rate, it seems, wears the face of Alexander Hamilton. 
 Five dollars 15 cents an hour, or $10? The difference could be significant as the campaign to raise the minimum wage heats up. Across the country, advocates for the working poor and various pro-labor groups promote raising the minimum wage in order to lift millions out of dire poverty. Their efforts have met fierce resistance from employer groups, which argue that paying untrained workers more will generate demand for higher pay up the ladder, too, causing inflation.
 The campaign is strong in New York, and earlier this year succeeded in getting legislation passed in both houses that would have raised the minimum wage incrementally to $7.15 by 2007. The measure was vetoed by Governor Pataki earlier this month.
 Despite the recent setback, advocates vowed to continue their efforts. Right after the Pataki veto, the Working Families Party, a labor-supported advocacy group based in Brooklyn, organized a rally in Mineola and four other locations statewide. 
 The Long Island Association says that an increase in the minimum wage isn't needed. The poorest workers already earn more than the government minimum, thanks to the law of supply and demand, the group says.
 Pearl Kamer, the organization's chief economist, dismissed the government minimum as implausible. Why? Anyone earning minimum wage, she said, could not afford food, clothing or housing in this region.
 Dr. Kamer said that even Long Island's poorest workers can, and do, hold out for more. ''On Long Island no one is willing to work for minimum wage, given the labor shortage we have on both the top end and the low end of the market,'' she said. As a result, the de facto minimum wage on Long Island is ''between $8 and $10,'' she said.
 Others organizations studying the issue have arrived at contrary conclusions. The Working Families Party analyzed Bureau of Labor Statistics reports and contends that about 97,000 people in Nassau and Suffolk would benefit from a $7.15 minimum. The Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization in Latham, N.Y., analyzed data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, released in March, and found that 8 percent of Nassau's work force and 7.3 percent of Suffolk's live on less than $7.15 an hour. 
 While the Fiscal Policy Institute's position contradicts Dr. Kamer's, the organization echoed her reasoning. ''The prevailing minimum wage is not high enough to afford a two-bedroom home at fair-market rent anywhere in America,'' the institute said in a statement. On Long Island, it isn't enough for a rented room with a hotplate.
 Hard data are elusive. Neither the federal nor state labor departments track hourly wage levels. Nor do the Long Island Association or other regional business groups. Consequently, evidence cited by both sides is anecdotal and speculative.
 Gary Huth, an economist with the State Labor Department in Hicksville, staked out a position midway between the nobody-versus-multitudes polarities. While some Long Islanders do work for minimum wage, he said, it is probably not a large number of people, and employers pay above the minimum wage to recruit workers. 
 People on both sides of the argument agree on at least one thing: unskilled workers on Long Island today are increasingly immigrants.
 Irv Miljoner, the Long Island district director for the federal Labor Department's wage and hourly work division, said minimum-wage work was increasingly the province of those newly arrived in this country, who presumably have fewer options than other workers. 
 ''Overwhelmingly, those jobs today involve immigrants,'' Mr. Miljoner said, describing unskilled labor. Newcomers, he said, are disproportionately vulnerable to compensation abuses. 
 Union organizers have focused recruitment efforts increasingly on newcomers in recent years. Jose Alvarez, the acting president of the Long Island branch of the A.F.L.-C.I.O, in Farmingdale, said the union's organizing efforts increasingly focus on immigrants in such industries as retail, tourism and agriculture. Minimum-wage workers survive, he said, by rooming in motels, several families squeezing into rooms intended for one or two people. Often these workers are paid, illegally, less than the minimum wage, he said.
 ''This is widespread across Long Island among people working for the minimum wage,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''This is the hidden America.''
 While immigrants moving into minimum-wage jobs is a familiar urban phenomenon, historically that has not been so on Long Island. In Nassau and Suffolk, students worked not so much from necessity as from the desire to afford trendy clothes, cash to go out on dates, cars and other luxuries. They endured the summer elbow grease and after-school drudgery knowing their professional career paths would soon afford them much better.
 That Archie-and-Veronica world has disappeared, gone the way of rabbit ears and pocket calculators.
 Today, a combination of parental affluence and the students' own precocious careerism effectively rule out low-paying part-time jobs, Dr. Kamer said.
 ''Students would rather work unsalaried in a position in their future field, as interns, rather than make minimum wage cooking hamburgers,'' she said. In most cases, ''their parents agree with them,'' she said.
 She acknowledged that the trend has been cited, less benignly, by those asserting that America's youth has grown soft. ''They aren't lazy at all,'' Dr. Kamer said. ''They feel it isn't necessary to work these jobs.''
 The immigrants who have succeeded them earn more in a day on Long Island, mopping floors, irrigating lawns and cleaning swimming pools than they might have in a month in such homelands as Guatemala and Ecuador.
 Last year, word of Long Island largess reached Eric Rodriguez, a 37-year-old Honduran living in Texas.
 Mr. Rodriguez said he was living in Houston with green card status, earning $7 an hour. A Honduran friend he knew from Texas phoned from Glen Cove, where he had moved. The friend bubbled with stories about Long Island prosperity, and the general availability of $10-an-hour jobs.
 Mr. Rodriguez, a mechanic by training, hurriedly made plans and headed for Glen Cove. He too now earns $10 an hour repairing auto and boat engines, meeting potential employers each morning at the city-run shape-up site on Sea Cliff Avenue. Some days, with overtime, he brings home $100, or more. The steady employment allows Mr. Rodriguez to send $200 back home every month to support his two small sons.
 ''There is a lot of money on Long Island,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, speaking in Spanish. Switching to English, he added: ''New York is a good life.''

HEADLINE: Make Way for The Big Duck

BYLINE: By WILLIAM McSHANE. 
William McShane is president of the Long Island Business Aviation Association.

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE 

 BODY:
IT'S time to move Long Island's classic roadside icon, the Big Duck, to this region's newest entryway for hundreds of thousands of visitors -- MacArthur Airport in Bohemia.
 Once considered a traveler's curiosity, the wood and concrete duck was originally intended to greet the motorists traveling to Long Island in the 1930's, when Sunrise Highway was the principal artery and agriculture (like duck farms) was the predominant industry. Roadside stands would try almost anything to attract the attention of New York visitors out for a ride in the countryside, and competition was fierce. An example of popular marketing at the time and kitsch culture, the Big Duck was a contemporary of roadside architecture like huge apples, Freudian frankfurters and Paul Bunyons that towered above the Studebakers and Ford flivers. The Big Duck was the 10-ton front office where Martin Maurer sold ducks and eggs fresh from his farm in Riverhead. 
 Today these cultural artifacts of a bygone era are as rare as, well, duck teeth. Most disappeared in the 1950's, when new interstate highways made the idea of a casual drive along rural roads to get from here to there a curious oddity. As the tempo of American life revved into high gear, no one had the time or patience to pull over for a two-story Native American, a concrete ice cream cone or a similar attraction. Yet Long Island's Big Duck survived the wrecker's ball, decades of indifference and its current move four miles down the road in Flanders. Today it is a registered national landmark, efficiently managed by Friends for Long Island's Heritage, and protected from all those who would seek its rendering with a bulldozer.
 What it is not protected from is indifference. Currently tucked away in Suffolk County's Sears Bellows County Park, the Big Duck is better known by Long Island trivia aficionados than by the general public it was originally designed to entice. There are preliminary discussions supposedly with Southampton officials to return the Big Duck to its previous site, but that won't alter its modest visitation numbers.
 Suffolk County's town and county leadership should be pondering how they can best celebrate the history of the Big Duck. If they want to ensure that as many visitors as possible actually see it, then they should move the structure to the one place where it is guaranteed an audience of hundreds of thousands of travelers to and from Long Island: MacArthur Airport, where Southwest Airlines and the Town of Islip opened the new $55 million Peter J. McGowan Concourse earlier this month. 
 By transporting the Big Duck to the airport, we would acknowledge that this concrete fowl isn't some dusty curio from another era but a dynamic and relevant participant in a multibillion-dollar tourism industry now crucial to the economic well being of Long Island. And by taking its place at MacArthur, the Big Duck would reclaim its status as a highly visible landmark for travelers and reinforce its role as a fun icon for visitors. The Big Duck even has the potential to become a tourist attraction in its own right, and its new setting at MacArthur Airport would help spread the news about the airport's new terminal.
 The move will cost at least $60,000, but taxpayers need not pay for it. If the airport is as enthusiastic about having the Big Duck as a gateway as it is about its expanded flight schedule, it might consider using a portion of increased passenger revenue to pay for the move. 
 The biggest obstacles to relocating the Big Duck to such a visible location are inertia, confusion over jurisdiction and the fondness that some on the East End may have for the giant bird. In the end those who control the duck's fate must realize that effective protection of our heritage requires that our icons and artifacts be seen and appreciated by as many people as possible. 
 The Big Duck has always been meant to amuse, attract and entertain. It can't do that job sitting on a quiet backwater road. Let's give the Big Duck a boarding pass to MacArthur Airport.

HEADLINE: In Cleveland's Suburbs, New Luxury vs. Old

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

DATELINE: SHAKER HEIGHTS, Ohio 

 BODY:
BUILT nearly 100 years ago as one of the country's first planned communities, this is still in many ways an ideal community. Old-growth trees shade stately English Tudor, Country French and Georgian homes. Lush green lawns gently slope toward winding residential streets. Well-maintained rapid transit lines whisk people to downtown Cleveland in less than 20 minutes. The public school system serves an economically and racially diverse student body while remaining one of the best in Ohio. Exclusive private schools, lured by the area's founders with free land, are still in operation today.
 But these houses are not as popular as they once were. While moderately priced homes in Shaker Heights still sell at a rapid clip, more expensive homes are moving slowly, and for lower prices than owners imagined they might get. ''I wouldn't say the values have gone down, but they've stagnated,'' said Daniel P. Forrester, a vice president at Michael S. Folkman & Associates, who estimates that he conducts about 40 percent of all home appraisals over $1 million in the Greater Cleveland market. ''There have not been a lot of sales in the million or more range lately.'' 
 Shaker Heights has long been one of the most desirable and well-known suburbs in the Midwest. But these old houses don't have the vast kitchens and great rooms that today's buyers want -- and having the highest property tax rate in the state doesn't help either. Meanwhile, custom-built houses of equal square footage with high-tech amenities near downtown Cleveland are springing up and selling for less. 
 After retiring as chief executive of TRW, Joseph T. Gorman put his house in Shaker Heights, which has seven bedrooms and is more than 13,000 square feet, up for sale. He first asked $2.35 million. It was on the market for two years, and in July finally sold for $1,665,000. So far this year, it is the only big sale in Shaker Heights, even though five properties priced at more than $1 million are on the market.
 ''It's very unusual for Shaker Heights to have five houses on the market in this price range,'' said Monique Plociak, a real estate agent with Realty One. According to Ms. Plociak, several years ago, homes in the very high-end market sold more quickly, keeping the inventory low. Some houses changed hands without ever being listed.
 In other parts of the country, a million-plus home might seem like a bargain. But in Greater Cleveland, where the average price for a single-family home is $171,012, finding buyers in the $2 million price range has been challenging lately not just in Shaker Heights, but in Greater Cleveland, as companies like TRW have moved their headquarters out of the Cleveland area.
 On South Park Boulevard, the most exclusive street in Shaker Heights, Ms. Plociak is currently listing a 7,686-square-foot colonial once owned by Art Modell, former owner of the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens football teams. The house, which was initially listed for $3.3 million in January but has since come down to $2.75 million, is situated on an acre and a half of beautifully landscaped real estate. Original craftsmanship is still intact throughout the house, such as ornately carved oak paneling, stone walls and an iron balcony in the octagonal foyer. Mr. Modell added a great room for entertaining football players, but aside from this modification, the structure of the house remains as it was built in 1937.
 And that, it seems, is part of the problem. The house has only a two-car garage, the laundry is in the basement, and there is no master bedroom on the first floor, or high-tech wiring. Those aspects limit the appeal of the house to a small subset of buyers who like old houses and can afford to pay $70,000 a year in taxes. The current owners, who are in their 70's, have lived here for 30 years. Much of the decor is traditional, with peach-colored wall-to-wall carpeting covering hardwood floors and heavy drapes obscuring original leaded-glass windows.
 ''Five years ago, this house would have sold in a day,'' Ms. Plociak said. While the property tax rate in Shaker Heights remains the same as it was five years ago, fewer people seem to be willing to absorb the cost as other options become available. There is more competition now, she said, with new houses not much farther away that are less expensive, with lower taxes. ''They're easier to maintain and they have all the bells and whistles,'' she said. ''And you don't have to come in and redecorate.''
 Typical of the competition she is talking about is the Barrington Estate Homes and Golf Club Community, a gated Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course community about 30 miles from downtown Cleveland. A new home features natural materials like shell-stone tile flooring, hand-carved molding and custom paint in earth tones. Fiber-optic wiring is capable of handling 36 telephone lines and supports an elaborate security system and zoned lighting, while the latest insulation and double-paned windows are energy efficient.
 Perhaps more important than high-tech amenities and neutral decor is the allocation of space. The 7,676-square-foot house has a four-car garage, first-floor master suite, a media room, multiple computer stations and a climate-controlled wine cellar. It also features one of the latest trends in new home building, a ''hearth room,'' which is essentially an enlarged kitchen with a fireplace.
 She has listed the house at $1.8 million and hopes to close a deal with a player for the Cleveland Browns in the very near future. Property taxes on this house are $24,000, about half of her Shaker listing, both because of the lower-selling price, but also because outlying communities do not have the same school costs. 
 Real estate agents and market analysts agree that the very high-end market is struggling throughout Greater Cleveland. But with virtually no population growth in the region, competition for buyers is increasing as large new houses are built on the fringes and ever-expanding highways make longer commutes easier. 
 But not everyone looking for high-tech amenities wants to be in a distant suburb, or live in a new house. To that end, Bradford Remington, owner of Main Street Holdings, a renovation company that specializes in older homes, is working on a house on South Park in Shaker Heights built in 1919 that he bought for $1.05 million. While leaving much of the original architectural detailing in place, he is installing air-conditioning and new wiring, and is reconfiguring the ground floor space. He plans to put about $600,000 into it and to sell it for $2 million.
 Thomas E. Bier, director of the Center for Housing Research and Policy at the Maxine Goodman Levine College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University, agrees that updating older homes in the high-end market could prove to be a good business. While he has not broken down figures specifically for this price range, his research concludes that homes built in the 20's and 30's have maintained their value over time. 
 Louis Tisler, executive director of the First Suburbs Consortium Development Council, a nonprofit group advocating on behalf of older, inner-ring suburbs in Greater Cleveland, called these homes ''great assets in this community.''
 ''With new construction you can get more house, but are you getting more home?'' he said. ''If you're looking at a South Park address and putting money into it, that is a good investment.''

HEADLINE: Housing for Artists? How About Bicycle Repairmen?

BYLINE: By JOE QUEENAN. 
Joe Queenan is the author of ''True Believers: The Tragic Inner Life of Sports Fans,'' released in paperback by Picador USA.

 BODY:
I LIKE artists as much as the next guy, but when I read that a Jersey City developer was converting a warehouse into an apartment building that would reserve six units for low-and moderate-income artists, I could feel my blood boil. According to news reports, Jersey City is already home to 1,600 artists, so it's not like six more Andy Warhol clones is going to make that much of a difference. Moreover, Jersey City is right across the river from New York, home to tens of thousands of artists, so the idea of designating special housing for even more painters and sculptors, whatever their economic condition, seems like a waste of precious resources.
 Why is it always artists who get the cheap apartments and converted lofts? Mainly because real estate developers are awarded tax breaks and variances if they agree to set aside a few units for those of a creative bent. But is this fair to taxpayers? Or to young people in less glamorous walks of life? Why can't these burgeoning burgs give tax breaks to developers who earmark housing for young people who are not artists? 
 Who do I have in mind? Certified financial planners, for starters. This is one of the most important occupations in America today, yet the average person erroneously believes that most certified financial planners are already wealthy. Not true. It takes years and years to establish oneself in this socially munificent profession, and young, lower-income C.F.P.'s have just as a strong a claim on society's resources as anyone else. Moreover, financial planners are less noisy than artists, much tidier, more civic-minded and more likely to provide products and services that society needs.
 I am certainly not suggesting than communities like San Francisco, Santa Fe and New York should stop subsidizing the arts, or that they should start diverting all of their resources to housing for financial planners. Nor am I arguing that C.F.P.'s are the only young people who should benefit from subsidized housing. Other occupations immediately come to mind. 
 For example, when was the last time that any major American city announced that it would set aside housing for cash-strapped bicycle repairmen? By keeping our bicycles in tip-top shape, these admirable youngsters make the roads safer and help ease urban congestion. Unlike many artists, they are not introverted, antisocial and mopey; I personally would love to live in a neighborhood filled with aspiring bicycle repairmen. But, lacking subsidized housing, none of them can afford to live here.
 Are there any other occupations that could benefit from subsidized housing? You bet. Proofreaders, volleyball coaches, baristas and short-order cooks all play a vital role in this society, yet we never hear of any developer setting aside apartments for them. Laundromat managers, tanning spa personnel and physical therapists are all vital cogs in the wheel of democracy, yet where are the handouts for them? 
 Another thing that bothers me about subsidized housing for artists is that painters, sculptors and producers of annoying video installations always take precedence over musicians and writers. Satire is one of the toughest rackets to break into in these United States, yet I have never once heard of any municipality converting old warehouses into public housing for wits, pundits or gadflies, much less curmudgeons. French horn players and bassoonists regularly have to pawn their Mozart scores to pay their heating bills, but nobody ever talks about subsidized housing for them. And don't even get me started on the economic misfortunes of the modern urban poet.
 The time has come for cities all across this great nation to rethink subsidy policies. America already has enough artists; what it really needs are more dental hygienists, more income-tax preparers, more teaching assistants. If Jersey City is serious about improving its quality of life, it should tell developers to set aside apartments for fledgling dog walkers, trainee barbers, neophyte bus drivers and cobbler's apprentices. The difference between 1,600 artists and 1,606 artists is minuscule; but bringing in six bright young pension-fund managers could really make Jersey City hop!
 Still, in doing this civic leaders must maintain standards. For example, if I ever read that developers are building low-income housing for stand-up comics, mimes, Civil War re-enactors or folk singers who butcher ''Blowin' in the Wind'' on the subway, I'm leaving the country for good. 
 And frankly, I don't think I'll be the only one leaving.

 BODY:

Planned Protests
Disruptions can be expected along the protest routes during the convention.

SUNDAY

1. Say No to the Bush Agenda, United for Peace and Justice
A national coalition of nearly 900 groups is planning a march at noon from north of 14th St. at Seventh Ave. past the convention site to Union Square Park. Organizers say it could attract 250,000 people.

MONDAY

2. March and Rally for Justice
Sponsored by Still We Rise, a coalition of more than 50 nonprofit organizations, many of them New York-based groups serving people infected with H.I.V., immigrants, the poor and the homeless. The demonstration begins at noon at Union Square and proceeds up Eighth Avenue to Madison Square Garden.

TUESDAY

Direct Action Day
An anarchist collective calling itself the A31 Action Coalition has organized a series of nonviolent civil disobedience events that will use parts of Midtown to stage demonstrations, without permits.

WEDNESDAY

3. Worker's Rally
At 4 p.m., the New York City Central Labor Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents nearly 400 New York City unions, is holding a rally on Eighth Avenue between 23rd and 30th Streets.

HEADLINE: Coming Soon: The Vanishing Work Force

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
TO be perfectly blunt about it, Pittsburgh is getting old. Half the line workers who repair, maintain and upgrade the grid at Duquesne Light, its electric utility, will be eligible to retire by the end of the decade. Likewise, half the 6,500 nurses working at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center hospitals will hit the typical retirement age of 55 in the next seven years. And just outside of town, at Westinghouse Electric, which designs and maintains nuclear power generators, the average age of engineers is the late 40's. 
 The trend has some people worried. ''A silent crisis threatens the prosperity of Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania,'' warned a report done two years ago by the Center for Competitive Workforce Development at Duquesne University. ''A declining and aging population places at risk the stability of the region's work force and opportunities for economic progress.''
 In other words, there just may not be enough young workers to go around in the not-too-distant future. So the older ones may have to stick around a lot longer than they originally planned. 
 That may seem counterintuitive, given the hand-wringing across the country about the sluggish pace of job creation. Indeed, Pittsburgh is flush with surplus workers, judging from an unemployment rate that jumped to 5.7 percent in July from 4.2 percent three years ago. The city's power industry, in particular, has shed about 40 percent of its jobs in the last 10 years. 
 Yet a peek through the demographic keyhole presents a startlingly different picture. More than 16 percent of Pittsburgh's population is above the official retirement age of 65. By 2012, southwestern Pennsylvania could face a shortage of 125,000 workers -- about a tenth the size of today's labor force, according to the Duquesne University report. 
 And what is happening in Pittsburgh appears to be an early installment of a demographic drama unfolding across the nation. As workers age, fewer new bodies are coming up the pipeline to replace them. According to projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the working-age population -- adults 16 to 54 who are neither in the military nor in jail -- will have grown by six million people from 2002 to 2012. By contrast, the 55-and-over age bracket will have expanded by 18 million.
 The shift will only intensify in the years that follow. By 2030, people 55 and older will make up 37 percent of the adult population, up from 15 percent today. ''This is a sleeper issue,'' said Charles E.M. Kolb, president of the Committee for Economic Development, a group of business and education leaders that conducts policy research in Washington. ''We do have a demographic time bomb.''
 How will it all play out? The wait at McDonald's may be a lot longer: the National Restaurant Association projects a shortage of 1.5 million restaurant workers by 2014. Or maybe the mail won't be delivered as fast: more than a quarter of all postal workers who were employed in 1998 will have retired by the end of 2008, according to a bureau study. Even the local house of worship may become a little crowded: one in five members of the clergy will be of pension age over the same period. Over all, 13 percent more people are expected to retire from 2003 to 2008 than did so in the previous five years. 
 Some companies -- though obviously not a majority -- are taking the longer view, by scrambling to secure tomorrow's work force. In 2002, Duquesne Light set up a two-year program at Allegheny County Community College to train new line workers. 
 The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is trying to recruit new nurses and retain veterans with a new career track that would allow them to continue to advance and receive pay increases. ''Most nurses leave clinical practice at about 55,'' said Gail Wolf, the chief nursing officer. ''We need to keep them at the bedside longer.''
 OTHER companies are turning to sources farther afield. The restaurant industry, for instance, is lobbying for easier immigration restrictions. Many companies, of course, are simply outsourcing jobs -- shifting production to labor-rich countries abroad. 
 But experts say that these efforts will be of little consequence, given the magnitude of the coming demographic dislocation. Like it or not, to deal with the aging of America's labor force, workers will probably be made to work longer. 
 ''Many businesses feel they have found solutions by sending jobs offshore or bringing immigrants to fill positions here,'' said Larry Anderson, president of the National Older Worker Career Center in Arlington, Va. ''But the problem is much larger. Business is going to have to tap the older work force.''
 On Friday, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, suggested to economists meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that Social Security and Medicare benefits should be curtailed to avoid fiscal disaster and keep workers on the job longer.
 Today, a 65-year-old is expected to live to 83. That is almost three years longer than the life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1970. But the aging of the work force is not just about longer life spans. It has more to do with a steep decline in the nation's production of young people -- a birth dearth. 
 The labor force started to swell in the second half of the 1960's, when the baby-boom generation began to come of age. But the boom was followed by a baby bust. The fertility rate dropped from 3.5 children per woman in the mid-1950's to about 2 in the 1970's. As a result, when the boomers start exiting the work force -- as they will in droves starting around 2008 -- they will leave a big demographic hole behind them.
 Aging is not just an American issue. According to projections from the United Nations, the median age in Switzerland is 40, five years older than that of the United States. And by the time America's median age reaches 40, around midcentury, half of all Italians will be over 52. 
 The United States has staved off the national aging process mostly by drawing immigrants -- who, on average, are younger and have higher fertility rates than the general American population. A study by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston found that new immigrants accounted for 47 percent of the increase in the labor force from 1990 to 2000. 
 Yet the poor countries that are sending their workers to the United States are getting older, too -- some at an even faster rate. Today, half of all Mexicans are under 25. But by 2050, Mexico's median age is expected to rise to 42, according to United Nations figures. 
 Aging, meanwhile, will steadily worsen America's labor outlook. The participation rate of the general population in the work force climbed to 67.2 percent in 2000 from 59.2 percent in 1950. But projections from the Labor Department call for it to fall back to 62.3 percent by 2030.
 As a result, the expansion of the labor force will slow, to just 0.6 percent a year over the first half of the 21st century, from 1.6 percent in the second half of the 20th. And the economy's dependency ratio, which measures the burden of retirees on workers, will narrow. In 2000, there were five people aged 20 to 64 for each person 65 or older. By 2030, the ratio will be less than 3 to 1. 
 Not everyone is convinced that a graying labor force will be a problem. Peter Cappelli, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, contends that unemployment leaves a big pool of workers that companies can tap even as aging reduces the overall size of the labor force. 
 He noted that the abundance of baby-boomer labor, though a boon for employers, wasn't so great for workers. Indeed, average hourly earnings of production workers in private industry fell by more than 15 percent, adjusted for inflation, as the boomers flowed through the workplace from the early 1970's to the mid-1990's. 
 If labor markets tighten, Mr. Cappelli argued, wages will rise and productivity will accelerate, sustaining economic growth. Moreover, higher wages may increase the supply of workers by drawing older people back into the job market. 
 But many experts are less sanguine. A 1998 study by economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris found that the rise in the dependency ratio alone could shrink United States living standards, as measured by per capita income, by about 10 percent by 2050. 
 It is also far from clear that Americans want to work longer. An AARP survey last year of workers over 50 found that 68 percent planned to work after the usual retirement age, but a Harris survey in 1992 among people who had already retired found that nearly 86 percent either were not able to work or simply did not want to. 
 ''Our older people are staying on longer because they can't afford to retire,'' said Ronald M. Moquist, president and chief executive of Raven Industries in Sioux Falls, S.D., a plastics and electronics maker.
 Over the past 50 years, both corporate and federal policies have encouraged workers to leave the rat race and to go bask in Florida as early as possible. Social Security payments, for example, were structured in 1935 to favor retirement as soon as 62 and no later than 65. After that, the extra benefits earned from working one more year did not make up for the year's delay in getting the benefits. Companies also built their pension plans to favor early retirement and make way for younger workers. 
 So it is perhaps not surprising that until recently, workers were retiring sooner rather than later. In 1950, some 87 percent of men aged 55 to 64 and 46 percent of those over 65 were working. By 2000, the shares had dropped, to 67 percent for the younger group and 17 percent for the older one. 
 One way or another, companies may need to figure out ways to entice workers to toil later in life. Rudolph G. Penner, an expert on aging at the Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington, says he believes that employers should make it easier for older workers to stay on the job, through flexible work schedules and phased retirement that allows them to reduce their workload gradually before full retirement.
 The government may have to play a part, too. Because higher health care costs are a big disincentive to keeping older workers, Mr. Penner said the government should offer Medicare as primary insurance, rather than secondary, to the elderly employed. That would make it cheaper for employers to keep them. And the government should readjust rules to allow employers to offer older workers sliding scales of benefits for part-time or occasional work. 
 Indeed, some of these forces are already aligning. Many traditional company pension plans, for example, are being replaced by defined-contribution plans like 401(k)'s. That provides an incentive for employees who have lost the security of their defined-benefit pensions to work longer and build their nest eggs.
 And the ballooning cost of health insurance cuts both ways. Though rising premiums are rough on employers, they also make it harder for people to leave their jobs -- and their employer-provided health coverage -- before Medicare kicks in at 65.
 THE effort to shore up Social Security -- to compensate for more and longer-lived retirees -- has prompted the government to start gradually raising the age when a worker can claim full benefits, to 67 from 65. But some experts say more is needed. In 1999, the Committee for Economic Development recommended that the full retirement age for Social Security payments be raised gradually to 70 over three decades -- and then indexed to longevity. 
 All of this is sapping workers' confidence in their ability to retire. According to the 2004 Retirement Confidence Survey, an annual study done by two Washington organizations, the Employers Benefit Research Institute and the American Savings Education Council, barely 36 percent of workers are confident that they will have enough money to take care of basic expenses during retirement. And the share of workers who expect to retire before 65 has dropped to 37 percent from 49 percent a decade ago.
 ''The good news is that we are living longer,'' said Mr. Kolb, the Committee for Economic Development president. ''But people are finding they haven't saved enough to afford the lifestyle they want, so by necessity people are staying longer in the work force.''
 The American economy may need them soon.

HEADLINE: Old, in the Way And Hard at Work

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
THE good news is we are living longer than ever before. The bad news is it's going to cost us. 
 As global fertility rates grow more slowly and increasing prosperity enhances life expectancy, a complicated side effect has emerged: big chunks of the world are starting to look like geriatric wards. It is uncertain how the world will pay for them. 
 A larger population of retirees, living longer, mixed with fewer young people means that the labor force will shrink as a percentage of the total population. With fewer people at work to support everyone else, living standards could fall. 
 Aging will put stress on government finances, drawing more and more money from budgets to pay for pensions and health care. Interest rates could rise sharply as a result, with the old drawing down their lifelong savings, depressing savings rates across the industrial world. 
 The upshot is that the bulging cohort of the elderly will probably be forced to work well into what today is considered old age, and then get stingier pensions when they eventually retire. Moreover, their children will have to work harder to support them. 
 ''This is the result of desirable trends,'' says Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations population division. ''Lower mortality is very good news. But we've got to adjust the system.''
 Consider the situation in Japan. With half the population over the age 41, Japan is among the oldest countries. With one of the lowest fertility rates -- 1.32 children per woman -- by 2050 there will be about 110 million Japanese, down from 127 million in 2000. And half of them will be over 53.
 According to projections by economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Japanese public spending on pensions and health will increase by some 3 percent of the gross domestic product by 2050. (The total American budget deficit, which is considered to be too large, is 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product.)
 Aging will also whittle away Japanese prosperity by cutting into the work force. In 2000 there were almost three people of working age for every person over 60. According to United Nations projections, by 2050 there will be less than one. By 2050, Japan's per capita income would be 23 percent lower than it would be if the dependency ratio remained stable, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development study. 
 This profile is far from unique. By 2050, half of all Italians and Spaniards, for example, will be over 52 years old.
 Even in the United States, the youngest of the wealthy nations, those over 65 are expected to represent 19 percent of the population in 2030, from 12 percent in 2000, when the bulge of baby boomers reach the autumn of their lives. Even by midcentury, when most boomers will be dead, 21 percent of the population will be over 65. 
 The poor world might help ease the rich world's plight. Broadly speaking, higher fertility rates and lower life expectancies mean that poorer nations are much younger than rich ones. In 2000, the median age in India was 23. Half the population of Brazil was under 25. According to United Nations estimates, virtually all of the increase in the world's population -- from 6.1 billion in 2000 to 8.9 billion in 2050-- will come from the so-called developing world. And its share of the global economy will rise to more than half from about a third today.
 Developed countries are relying on some of this youth by investing in factories in poorer nations and drawing workers by easing immigration restrictions.
 Yet such steps are likely to be only temporary palliatives, because countries with the pool of workers are getting old, too. The median age of China's population in 2000 was 30, five years younger than that of the United States. By 2050 it will be 43.8, four years older than America's. And in India, half the population will be over 38.
 The countries that will most suffer from aging populations are in the former Soviet bloc. Today, the 10 nations with the lowest rates of population growth are, in order, Estonia, Latvia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Lithuania, Russia, Hungary, Armenia and Belarus. Estonia's population will halve by 2050, to 657,000, and 42 percent of those left will be more than 60 years old.
 So what is the world to do? As more people live into their 80's and 90's, governments across the developed world will have to keep workers in the labor force longer and avoid a swell of budgetary red ink by revamping pension systems; retirement will be pushed back and benefits will be less generous.
 In the last several years, the Japanese government increased workers' pension contributions, raised the age at which pensions could be drawn to 65 from 60, and cut pension benefits for future retirees. The government is also offering grants to companies that hire older workers.
 In the United States, business leaders and some government officials have called for raising the retirement age. The full retirement age under Social Security is already being gradually increased to 67, from 65. In testimony before Congress on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, 78, repeated his call for an increase. 
 Governments around the world are trying all sorts of incentives to encourage families to have more children. Several European governments offer tax reductions for each additional child. And last year, Rocco Falivena, the mayor of Laviano, near Naples in southern Italy, offered women 10,000 euros (about $12,000 today) for each child they bear. 
 Unsurprisingly, many of these initiatives are meeting stiff resistance, bound as they are to cause scuffles between young and old. Already, in Japan and China offspring are legally bound to care for their parents. 
 Demands by the elderly for government services might draw public financing away from education and other priorities of the young. Sociologists in Europe have discussed the merits of giving voting rights to children, exercised by their parents, to protect the young from gerontocratic power. 
 ''We've gone from Pampers to Depends,'' says Mr. Chamie of the United Nations.
 The political battles of the future will be about who pays for them.

HEADLINE: A Greener Globe, Maybe

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
WITH all the hand-wringing about the economic perils of falling populations, and the prospect of a spreading demographic shift from explosion to implosion, there could be one beneficiary: the environment. 
 For decades, the rise in human numbers has been seen as the chief force threatening rain forests, depleting fisheries, choking the air and polluting the waters. So would an end to humanity's growth spurt make possible a not-too-diminished world with enough room for some wild things, with reasonably breathable air and drinkable water, with a livable climate?
 Many demographers, economists and ecologists are guardedly, often very guardedly, optimistic. 
 On the plus side, it is becoming clear that the heedless polluting that accompanied 20th-century industrialization is unlikely to be repeated by today's industrializing countries. Globalization, often portrayed as an environmental villain, may help, some experts say, because multinational corporations, setting up factories in poor countries, tend to set higher environmental standards, prompting local communities to demand similar standards for home-grown industries. China, far and away the most important of the developing economies, is already pushing to reduce sooty emissions. 
 Increasing urbanization should also help the environment. Almost all of the extra three billion or so people expected by midcentury will live in or around cities, according to studies by the United Nations and the National Academy of Sciences. City dwellers tend to use energy and other resources more efficiently, and have less direct impact on untrammeled landscapes like forests. 
 Much depends, however, on how those urbanites live, and think. ''An end to growing population pressure in rural areas could be good for protection of the environment,'' said Dr. Joel E. Cohen, the director of the Laboratory of Populations of Columbia and Rockefeller Universities. ''But only if the people who live in the cities understand that it's of interest to preserve watersheds, agricultural lands and wildlife areas.'' 
 On the minus side, some benefits of urbanization could be offset by a drop in the number of people per household. That means more households, more urban and suburban sprawl, and less efficient use of resources. Last year, Jianguo R. Liu at Michigan State, Paul R.Ehrlich at Stanford and other experts estimated in the journal Nature that by 2015, biological ''hot spots'' -- regions where human activity threatens habitat rich in rare species, as in South Florida and China's panda preserves -- would have 233 million extra households because of declining numbers of people per dwelling. 
 Also on the minus side: Even if the human population begins to decline after 2050, global warming, which is caused by the buildup in the atmosphere of so-called greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, is projected to cause major disruptions in the environment. Recent computer simulations, based on the current growth in energy use, estimate a 5 degree rise in the earth's average temperature in this century. 
 Without reduced use of current fuels, according to many scientists, the world population at midcentury -- 50 percent larger than today's but requiring three times as much energy -- will not be able to avert melting polar ice, shifting drought and flood patterns, and sea levels possibly rising a yard or more. 
 The environmental future depends on human behavior, not just human numbers. Clearly, it will be far easier to accommodate nine billion people than the 12 billion once anticipated. But not, many experts say, if all of them consume materials, energy and other goods at the rate Americans do now. 
 Some projections, however, offer some reason for optimism. In 2002, Paul E. Waggoner of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and Jesse H. Ausubel at Rockefeller University calculated that a 2 to 3 percent annual improvement in some combination of the efficiency of technologies used to make things or a decline in the waste produced in consuming things could offset the environmental damage from having 50 percent more people 50 years from now. 
 But in the end, some scientists argue, humanity cannot sustain the quality of the environment until it thinks of itself as part of, not separate from, the natural world.
 ''That may seem like pie in the sky,'' says Daniel B. Botkin, an ecologist and author of ''Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the 21st Century,'' but in the crowded, urbanizing world to come, he concludes, such an understanding will be essential.

HEADLINE: From Deep in the Depression, Three Low-Rise Corners

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
''During the boom, the sound of the riveter was loud in the city. Now it is so quiet you can hear a girder fall for miles away.'' 
 SO wrote James Thurber in January 1932 in his article ''New York in the Third Winter'' in Fortune magazine, as the last echoes of the building boom of the 1920's faded away.
 In place of new Park Avenue duplexes, big Midtown hotels and flashy Wall Street skyscrapers came two-story taxpayers, small buildings meant as temporary measures whose rental income would help cover the tax bill until economic times improved. 
 A good number of these low-rise monuments to expediency have survived for more than half a century -- a fact that is hard to believe, especially since they exist in a continually expanding real estate market. 
 Taxpayers, with their own distinct signatures, became the prototypical architectural development of the Depression decade. They were often built on land owned by an estate or controlled by a chain store -- those owners had the deep pockets necessary for reconstruction. 
 They were not just two-story versions of 1920's architecture, but emphasized new materials and forms, usually in the Art Deco or Art Moderne style.
 They were all dependent on retail traffic -- even in a Depression, New Yorkers bought newspapers, smoked and chewed gum -- and so such stores usually occupied corner sites. On Madison, Lexington and Third Avenues, 7 percent of the building plans filed in 1929 were for one- to three-story buildings; by 1933, it was 100 percent. 
 These new low-rises were the work of a new generation of architects, whose names are generally absent from the guidebooks to New York's important buildings -- names like Arthur Weiser, William I. Hohauser and J. M. Berlinger. 
 The big designers who controlled the profession in the 1920's were humbled: Emery Roth, who had done the San Remo at 74th and Central Park West, the Beresford at 81st and Central Park West and the Ritz Tower at 57th and Park, entered a 1933 competition for a two-story building in Times Square, and even that was not built. Roth got second place and a check for $150. 
 In 1935, at the southeast corner of 79th and Lexington, Hohauser designed a $12,000 taxpayer for the Liggett's drugstore chain, replacing a brownstone row house built on a 1,200-square-foot plot long before Lexington was a commercial street.
 Hohauser gave it a facade of green, tan and gun-metal porcelain enamel panels surrounding industrial-style windows, with a Moderne-style chevron over the doorway to the second floor. 
 Although now obscured by later canvas awnings, it's a perfect little jewel of the type, and the notoriously demanding New Yorker critic Lewis Mumford considered it ''quite decent.'' 
 On the West Side, in 1938 Weiser designed a two-story building on the southeast corner of 72nd and Broadway, replacing another corner row house.
 For $25,000, Weiser erected a crisp, shoebox-shaped structure, on a 1,500-square-foot lot, and covered it with large, square concave panels in a cream color. 
 A tiny strip of bright polychromed terra cotta running along the top was the structure's only decoration -- if you discount the 80-foot-long sign panel set into the second floor that advertised ''National Beauty Parlors.''
 This building, too, has been swamped by signage, particularly the huge Sleepy's sign at the second floor. 
 In 1939, Berlinger, who worked extensively in tenement alteration, designed one of New York's most unusual taxpayers, the little modernist corner building at John Street and Broadway. The Broadway section is two stories high, the part farther down John Street six stories tall, all on an irregular plot of about 4,500 square feet. 
 A subway station is underneath the Broadway side of the building, and perhaps it was for this reason that Berlinger erected the lower portion at Broadway, because of limits in foundation size. 
 The materials were strictly vernacular Art Deco -- tan ceramic panels and black glass piers. But the geometry of the two sections -- one low, with a curved corner, the other high, with spare, rectangular forms -- was quite European. 
 The result was a striking work for New York that emulated German modernist design, like the Fagus factory in Alfeld an der Leine, Germany, by Walter Gropius.
 A particularly nice fillip is the separate fire staircase on the high portion -- in photographs it looks as if it is encased in glass, but it is actually a simple screen of wire mesh. 
 Taxpayers are really just shards of buildings, and many have in fact been swept up in two decades of rising land values.
 A limestone one-story taxpayer designed in 1923 at 96th and Madison on a 3,500-square-foot lot was demolished earlier this year for a 13-story apartment house.
 But not every low building is developable, especially when existing rents and billboard revenues sweeten the low-rise pot.
 At 79th and Lexington, John Bono, head of Headington Wines and Liquors, said that his father started the business in 1941 and that he now owns the building. ''Almost every day, we have offers,'' he said, ''but they are people who want to combine it with other parcels'' and don't have them yet. He added, ''I don't think development would work here anytime soon -- this is a very prosperous retail location.'' 
 At Broadway and John Street, Richard Marcus, the property manager, said that one family had owned the building for nearly half a century. 
 He also says that others, including himself, have tried to combine the plot with a larger assemblage, but without success, and that the site itself is a bit small, especially with the construction concerns posed by the subway complex underneath. 
 Over at 72nd and Broadway, the owner of the property is registered as East End Associates, which is apparently part of the estate of the late Stanley Stahl, a major property investor. 
 Marianne Dziuba, senior vice president of Stahl Real Estate, did not return repeated telephone calls.
 The Upper West Side/Central Park West Historic District, designated in 1990, was drawn to include this modest work. So even though it is now nearly invisible under advertising signs, Weiser's building is likely to survive for quite some time.

HEADLINE: Delegates Leaning to Right Of G.O.P. and the Nation

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
THE Republican Party intends to show a somewhat moderate face to the nation during the convention this week in Madison Square Garden. But the delegates who will gather here and are shaping the party platform hold more conservative views than do most Republican voters, and substantially more conservative ones than those of voters at large, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 The delegates are nearly unanimous in their support for the war in Iraq. A full 96 percent said the United States did the right thing going into Iraq, compared with only 78 percent of all voters who call themselves Republicans and 46 percent of all voters. The figures on voters came from a separate, nationwide Times/CBS News Poll.
 And 86 percent of the delegates said the results so far in Iraq were worth the loss of American lives, compared with 70 percent of Republican voters and 36 percent of all voters. 
 The poll of 1,200 of the 2,509 delegates was conducted from Aug. 3 to Aug. 23 by telephone, fax and e-mail. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points. The nationwide poll of 823 voters was conducted by telephone from July 11 to July 15, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 Two-thirds of the delegates described themselves as conservative, while one-third said they were moderate. Almost none of them perceive President Bush as a liberal, although 8 percent of Republican voters do.
 On social issues, the delegates tend to reflect their party. For example, 38 percent of both delegates and Republican voters say abortion should be outlawed altogether. Similarly, they reflect the party's division over embryonic stem cell research.
 But they are more conservative than the party as a whole when it comes to gay marriage. Just 3 percent of delegates say gay couples should be allowed to marry, while 11 percent of Republican voters would allow it. Almost half the delegates, about the same amount of Republican voters, said there should be no legal recognition of gay marriage, although 41 percent of delegates and 36 percent of all Republicans said gay couples should be allowed to form civil unions.
 Delegates generally take a more unilateral stance on foreign policy, believe in a more limited role for government and believe more in free trade than their fellow Republicans or voters at large. And they are happier with the current level of legal immigration than other Republicans.
 Two-thirds of the delegates said the United States should be able to attack any country it thinks might attack the United States, while only half of Republican voters and a third of all voters agreed.
 And of the three groups, delegates have the least regard for the United Nations. Only 7 percent said it was extremely important for the United States to work through the United Nations to solve international problems, while a third of all Republicans and half of all voters agree.
 Just 3 percent of the delegates said that the United States should have stayed out of Iraq, while 19 percent of Republican voters and half of all voters agreed with that statement.
 The delegates are more in sync with their party on the question of whether the United States should try to change a dictatorship to a democracy where it can. About 40 percent of the delegates and Republican voters agree with that idea, while only 15 percent of Democratic voters do.
 The delegates named the economy as the most important issue in their states, but they also rated terrorism and defense as the next most important issues.
 In a follow-up interview, Norman Riffel, 65, a delegate from Springfield, Neb., who owns a moving and storage company, said: ''President Bush has to lay out a plan for addressing terrorism, creating more jobs and building stronger relationships with other nations. These are all high priorities.''
 In something of a rebuff to Republican officials who picked New York for the convention as an evocation of what they perceive as President Bush's finest hour, nearly one in five delegates said they should have picked someplace else.
 Thirty-one percent said they were somewhat or very worried about a terrorist attack in New York, slightly more than the 27 percent of Democratic delegates who were worried about an attack in Boston. But New Yorkers are even more concerned than the delegates, with 53 percent of them worried about a terrorist attack this week.
 While 94 percent of the Republican delegates said they had a good impression of New York, they expressed little interest in venturing out into the city. Asked if there was any particular place or thing that they wanted to be sure to see while here, the biggest percentage (29) said ''nothing.'' The next-highest percentage (21) named the Statue of Liberty, and the third-highest (16) said ground zero.
 They hold Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was mayor during the terrorist attacks, in high regard, even though he is more socially liberal than many of them. Ninety-one percent said they had a favorable view of Mr. Giuliani, which is nearly as many as the 94 percent with a favorable view of Vice President Dick Cheney.
 They take a dimmer view of Senator John McCain, the maverick Arizona Republican, who was rated favorably by 62 percent (but who often tops other polls as one of the most popular politicians in America).
 In interviews, the delegates applauded President Bush, citing his character rather than specific policies. ''His conviction is his greatest strength,'' said Paul Willis, 50, a delegate from Pahrump, Nev., and a retired carpenter.
 But like others, Marti Halverson, a homemaker from Etna, Wyo., expressed concern that the president did not always put his best foot forward. ''His greatest weakness is inability to communicate,'' she said. 
 She also said he had a job to do at the convention. 
 ''He has to convince the American public that in this case, in the case of Iraq, might is right,'' she said. ''Because so many good Republicans are doubting the plan.''
 People who become delegates to their party's conventions tend to be political activists, many of them driven into politics because of firm views on an issue or philosophy. Delegates to both the Republican and Democratic conventions in recent years have tended to be farther to the right or the left than voters in their own party and certainly farther from the center than the public at large.
 The Republican delegates are adamantly in favor of free trade, even at the cost of jobs at home, and strongly against regulation of business and the environment. This is substantially at odds with Republican voters as a whole.
 And more than their fellow Republicans, the delegates said they preferred cutting taxes to reducing the deficit, were less concerned that antiterrorism measures were restricting civil liberties, and believed that presidential candidates should discuss the role of religion in their private lives as part of their campaigns.
 The Republican delegates are less diverse by race, gender and income than the delegates at the Democratic convention were, but they are more diverse than the delegates at previous Republican conventions.
 For example, 85 percent of the delegates at this convention are white, compared with 89 percent in 2000 and 91 percent in 1996. Six percent are black, compared with 2 percent in 2000. (In Boston, 68 percent were white and 18 percent black.) Seven percent of Republican delegates are Hispanic, compared with 3 percent in 1996 (and 12 percent of Democratic delegates this year).
 Twenty-seven percent of the delegates said they were millionaires, compared with 14 percent of the delegates at the Democratic convention last month in Boston.
 A quarter of them are members of the National Rifle Association, while only 9 percent of the voters are, and 45 percent own a gun, while 30 percent of all voters do.

HEADLINE: Recapturing an Era Paved With Silver

BYLINE: By PAUL LAROCCO

 BODY:
THE rich silver manufacturing history of Meriden and Wallingford exists today only in remnants, in pieces in storage and in the stories from the ever-dwindling number of people who are familiar with its heyday. 
 ''The sign on the highway when you used to drive into Meriden would say, 'Welcome to the Silver City of the World,''' said Bob Johnston, a 77-year-old former sales representative for the International Silver Company, one of the nation's largest silver manufacturers for most of the 20th century. ''Through the years though, by attrition, these places all dried up and really, there's very little in that area these days. It's just a shame.''
 A small group of local historians agree and want to bring silver back to the forefront. Members of the Wallingford Historic Preservation Trust and silver enthusiasts hope to open a new American Silver Museum. They have already put a million dollars into an old home on Main Street in Wallingford. 
 ''I just feel it's so important we maintain that history for our children,'' said Ellen Mandes, a member of the trust's board, and an avid collector who has donated hundreds of silver pieces and Victorian-era furniture for the museum's anticipated opening. ''So many people have no idea about some of the things that were made right here. They've never seen an ice cream fork, or a muddler, or anything like that.''
 A muddler is a small spoon with a pointed end that was used for removing tea leaves, but Ms. Mandes said her active role in the silver museum project is not just to teach children about the obscure cutlery once produced in Central Connecticut. The larger motivation is to ensure that the sterling silverware and serving sets that once made their way to European royalty and other famed figures around the world return to their original home to stay.
 In the late 1980's, Ms. Mandes was part of a group that raised nearly $4 million dollars to erect the Meriden American Silver Museum in the city's downtown. After opening to much hoopla in 1994, the museum lasted barely two years before folding because of a lack of money. A struggle then ensued in which collectors from Providence, R.I., attempted to get the museum's collection moved there for that city's own silver museum efforts. The threat of losing the collection seemed to boost everyone's resolve to find a new home that would last.
 ''When I first moved here,'' Ms. Mandes said, referring to her arrival in Wallingford from Washington D.C. in 1968, ''There was so much silver here. I had collected thousands of pieces already, but I hadn't seen anything like what was in this area. When they talked about taking the collection to Providence, there was no way at all we were going to allow that to happen.''
 In 1999, after several years of searching for a suitable location, the Wallingford Historic Preservation Trust was given a grand, mid-18th-century Italianate home to relocate the museum, which they dubbed the Franklin & Harriet Johnson Mansion after its original owners. There was one problem, however. The house had been given several facelifts since its 1866 construction and had lost essentially all of its Victorian era charm.
 ''Whatever you could do to ruin a house, it was done,'' said John LeTourneau, a trust member who served as director of restoration for the Johnson Mansion. ''But it still had its basic integrity, which was important.''
 Bolstered by a $500,000 grant from the State Department of Economic and Community Development in early 2002, work began in earnest on the home. With several hundred thousand dollars more in donations, the house was restored to its original state, with a period-appropriate staircase, moldings, a new cupola, and the trust's best guess of the home's original color: cream yellow and avocado green. But necessary work to make the home a state-approved museum site handicap accessibility, a state-of-the-art security system and modern electrical wiring drained the trust of its funds to finish the project on the fast-track timeline it had hoped.
 Outside the home recently, a billboard used for an old fund-raiser rested against the wall. It showed a thermometer marked in dollars already raised, reading $800,000. The top of the glass bulb read $1.2 million, however. Inside, century-old, unfinished furniture rested unassembled on the floor. The walls were bare of any decor, and nicked and scuffed floors were coated with sawdust. 
 The home, even with a full, hand-carved 1847 Rogers Brothers tea set on display that morning, looked nowhere near ready for the public's eyes. But the trust president, Jerry Farrell Jr., said that he still hopes to hold some sort of grand opening this fall, although the museum is still well short of the $500,000 it estimates it needs for carpeting, wallpaper and a full exterior landscaping (the grounds are still dirt and gravel) appropriate to the period.
 ''If people came into this fully-built, fully-decorated place, with every piece of silver that ever existed already on display,'' Mr. Farrell said, ''they'd say, 'Why do you need our help?'''
 A fellow trust member, Candice Brashears, said, ''The house here, in the state it's in now, provides people with a good community opportunity to engage in what we're doing.''
 Ms. Mandes, asked later about the trust's financial situation, was more blunt.
 ''We desperately need money,'' she said.
 One thing the trust has going for it, however, is a team of volunteers, led by Mr. Farrell, which has gathered from around the world thousands of pieces of silver produced in Meriden and Wallingford during its glory days. In addition, the group has located invaluable historical perspective from former area silver workers like Mr. Johnston, and the 83-year-old Bill Toth.
 Mr. Toth, who entered the silver industry as an apprentice at R. Wallace & Sons Company in 1939, was one of the last employees of what became Wallace Silversmith Inc. (International Silver merged with Wallace in 1984, and worked as one company in Wallingford until Boston's Syratech Corporation purchased the company and moved operations in the early 1990's.) Even after the firm shut the company down locally, however, Mr. Toth continued working out of Wallingford as an analyst, before retiring a decade ago.
 ''For a while we were all worried where we were going to end up,'' Mr. Toth said. ''Everything was leaving.''
 In his 54 years with Wallace, the Wallingford resident designed flatware patterns that became national bestsellers, watched his plant produce machine gun clips during World War II, and over all, watched his hometown go from the center of the silver world to an industrial ghost town.
 Mr. Johnston recently sent the trust in Wallingford what he calls ''one of the larger silver libraries in the country'' more than 100 volumes of scholarly texts and auction catalogues.
 ''This is a project that excites me,'' said Mr. Johnston, who lives in Baltimore and is preparing for retirement from the private silver appraisal business he runs. ''I was on the board for the one in Meriden that closed, but these days, there are a lot of ways to promote a museum, and I think there will be a market.''

HEADLINE: An Encore Effort to Bring Shakespeare Back to Stratford

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: STRATFORD, Conn. 

 BODY:
Long before Indian-sponsored casinos became the biggest reason people traveled to Connecticut, the state's biggest draws were Mystic Seaport and Shakespeare, as performed here. 
 From its perch overlooking the Housatonic River and the Long Island Sound, the Shakespeare theater in Stratford offered world-class productions in a grand setting. Schoolchildren came by the busload to see their first serious play and experience small pleasures like a garden featuring 81 plants mentioned in Shakespeare's work. Wealthy patrons came by yacht. Wandering minstrels serenaded the crowd, and picnic blankets were as inescapable as coolers at a tailgate party. 
 But the theater's finances were always shaky, even when Katharine Hepburn and James Earl Jones were filling all 1,500 seats, and the place has been dark for 15 years. 
 The Stratford Festival Theater Inc., has controlled the theater since 1995. It received money from the state, including a $500,000 grant and a $1.5 million loan guarantee, to restore the theater in 1999, but it ran out of money before the work was done. 
 The festival group did make a dent. New carpeting and seats await installation. The stage has been mechanized and the building winterized. A rack of donated clothes stands ready to be turned into costumes. 
 ''That's how close we came,'' said Robert L. Richard, a retired engineer who oversaw repairs and tended the building for Stratford Festival Theater.
 Close enough in another way: the stage was extended, in the shape of a prow, into the audience. That was for a 2000 production of ''The Tempest'' that never opened.
 Now, renovation is at a standstill and theater supporters are pinning their hopes on Connecticut's new governor, M. Jodi Rell, asking her to invoke the state's legal right to seize the property. Many believe that unless the state acts, and then sets aside $5 million to $7 million for restoration, there is little chance of bringing Shakespeare back here any time soon. The town is angling to gain control of the property if the state seizes it, but officials are having trouble persuading the state to give it to the town free of liens and with few restrictions on future use. The executive director of the Stratford Chamber of Commerce, Laura Hoydick, said the town coveted the site because of ''the history and beauty of the theater. 
 ''It's something that is unique to Stratford and still has people remembering it 25 to 30 years later,'' she said. 
 One reason may be that the signs directing drivers to the site of the Stratford Festival Theater are still prominent on nearby highways and roads. But anyone who follows the signs is met by a boarded-up theater on an unkempt 12-acre lot.
 ''It's a shame,'' said Charles Cornelius, a Stratford resident, as he drove through the property recently. His father-in-law was one of the carpenters who built the place.
 Mr. Richard, the engineer who worked on the restoration, put it bluntly: ''We need a deep pocket.''
 The theater was founded in 1955 by Lawrence Langner, a patent lawyer and theatrical producer. In 1931, he founded the Westport Country Playhouse. The Shakespeare Festival Theater opened in Stratford with a performance of ''Julius Caesar,'' joining the ranks of stages in England and Canada where Shakespeare's work is celebrated. 
 Mr. Langner's ambitions were as grand as the space. He modeled the octagonal building after the Globe Theater in England, and arranged for France to donate the teak. And by his death in 1962, the theater was a showcase for talent, new and old.
 Christopher Plummer was Marc Antony in the inaugural production of ''Julius Caesar,'' sharing the stage with Jack Palance as Cassius, Roddy McDowell as Octavius, Raymond Massey as Brutus, and Jerry Stiller as Trinculo. Years later, in 1981, Mr. Plummer packed the house again as Iago in a production of ''Othello'' starring James Earl Jones that moved to Broadway.
 John Houseman was an early artistic director. Bert Lahr was Bottom in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' in 1958.
 Katharine Hepburn made herself so at home between performances that she was given a cottage on the grounds. 
 Despite the star-studded productions, the theater nearly always lost money. Joseph Verner Reed, a businessman and diplomat who supported the arts, covered the deficits until his death in 1973. Unable to pay its bills after that, it went dark once, reopened and then filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982.
 To keep the bank from foreclosing in 1983, the state used about $1 million in funds dedicated to the preservation of open space. That turned the theater into a public park under the stewardship of the state's Department of Environmental Protection. Save for a brief last-gasp season in 1989, the theater has been under wraps ever since..
 But there are memories and mementos. Lucille Nichols, historian for the theater, has assembled a multivolume history of the theater from old programs, photographs and other artifacts. State Senator George Gunther of Stratford said state officials told him not to expect much financial support from the state, given his opposition to former Gov. John G. Rowland's dashed efforts to lure the Patriots to Hartford with the promise of a new football stadium.
 But officials with the state's economic development office pointed out the state's contribution in 1999, during the second of Governor Rowland's three terms. 
 ''People might question us putting more money into something that has not been working,'' said Richard J. LoPresti, director of the state's office of business and industry development. ''Thus far, there's been no return on our investment.''

HEADLINE: Off-Court Achievements at the U.S. Open

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin. 
This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DAWN SCHAEFER doesn't care much for tennis. But she will travel to Flushing nearly every morning of the next two weeks to spend up to eight hours a day at the United States Open tennis tournament. 
 If you find your way to the ''food village'' there (to nosh on a $7.50 hamburger, perhaps?) you might see her. She'll be wearing her uniform -- black pants, a navy golf shirt and a black cap that says Restaurant Associates. She got her job through the YAI/National Institute for Disabilities Network (YAI once was an abbreviation for the Young Adult Institute, a forerunner organization), and its subdivision, the Corporate Source, which provides training and work opportunities for adults with learning and developmental impairments. 
 Restaurant Associates, which operates the food village at the Open every year, has been including the disabled among its employees there for the last six years. This time around, it will have 50 of them (last year it was 40) among the 1,400 staff members cooking, serving and cleaning. 
 The benefit to the disabled workers is as concrete as a paycheck and as intangible as self-esteem, says Joel Levy, chief executive of YAI. ''You cannot overestimate the importance of a job to our people.'' Ninety-two percent of Americans with developmental disabilities are unemployed, he says. In New York State, 84 percent of people with disabilities in a vocational program like the one he runs have no jobs.
 The disabled workers at the Open, he says, know they are lucky. ''Most people make money and they don't enjoy what they do. Our employees enjoy the fact that they have a job.'' 
 The companies hiring the disabled also benefit. The simplest entry-level jobs -- cleaning tables or refilling ketchup dispensers -- are tough to keep filled, Dr. Levy says. ''But this population does very well at repetitive tasks. They don't get bored.'' 
 That is particularly important at this year's Open. 
 ''With the Republican National Convention coming at the same time as the Open, we had to scramble to cobble together a work force,'' says Michael Sullivan, vice president for operations for the sports and entertainment division of Restaurant Associates. (By the by, Mr. Sullivan defends the price of his $7.50 hamburgers, describing them as ''Certified Angus Beef, grilled to order.'') The jobs the YAI workers fill pay $8 an hour or less, and ''if I had to go out on the street and fill that job classification, I would not get nearly the same kind of focused work force,'' Mr. Sullivan says. 
 To qualify for these jobs, YAI employees attend training programs throughout the year. ''They teach us that you shouldn't come to work late, you shouldn't steal on the job,'' Ms. Schaefer said. Of course, she knew this before she took her class, she said. Things she didn't know included ''how to clock in and out.'' 
 Ms. Schaefer was one of a small group of YAI-trained workers I spoke to as they prepared to start work tomorrow. All but Ms. Schaefer have worked at the Open in other years. They do not mind the simplicity of their jobs, they told me. They are relieved that the jobs are ''easy'' and say they find the work ''fun.'' When they wear uniforms, customers think they have the answers, a feeling they enjoy. ''They ask me, 'Where is the ketchup? Where is the mustard?''' said Byron Freeman, 20. ''And I tell them.'' 
 Unlike Ms. Schaefer, Mr. Freeman is a tennis fan. ''I know the Williams sisters and Agassi and Andy Roddick,'' he said, noting that his favorites are not likely to come to the food village. They aren't the only ones who will be dining elsewhere. ''We don't eat the same food as the customers,'' Mr. Freeman said. Is the employee food better or worse than the Certified Angus burgers? Mr. Freeman giggled, but did not answer. 
 The employees all say that while they are grateful for this job, it is not their dream. ''If I had a choice, I would work in a hospital, helping people,'' said Peter Figueroa, 40. 
 Mr. Freeman would be a cashier if he could, he said, because ''I like to work with money.'' Boyd Cephus, 37, would ''work with old folks -- you know, older than me.'' Ms. Schaefer would be a registered nurse. She has taken a class to be a certified home health aide but she has not been able to find a job. In fact, punching the time clock at the Open will lead to her very first paycheck.
 All these workers know exactly what they will do with the money they make. Mr. Figueroa and Mr. Cephus will put theirs in the bank. Mr. Freeman's mother will take him to cash his check. ''Then I get to buy whatever I want,'' he said. 
 And Ms. Schaefer? She blushed when she answered. She is going to be married July 4, at City Hall. She is saving to buy a beautiful white dress.

HEADLINE: The Price Is Still Right

DATELINE: VALHALLA 

 BODY:
RAISE the cost of anything by 20 percent, and one would expect some gripes from customers.
 But when the county's Board of Legislators recently approved a 20.6 percent tuition increase at Westchester Community College here, bringing the annual tuition to $2,950 from $2,450, there was scarcely a peep.
 ''Surprisingly enough, we haven't heard anything from anybody,'' said Tere Wisell, director of admissions at Westchester Community College. ''We thought there might be some impact, but it's still such an affordable opportunity.'' 
 Perhaps it helped that students had known about the increase since late June, when the college's trustees voted to raise tuition, and the $500 annual additional payment had already been factored into tuition bills for the term that starts Sept. 7.
 ''We already went through the process, when the board of trustees voted in the tuition hike months ago,'' said Patrick Hennessey, director of college relations for the college. ''Students have been paying for fall registration as of last month.''
 One change during the past several years, Ms. Wisell suggested, has been a slight shift in the composition of the student body. What had begun nearly six decades ago as a higher education institution primarily for nontraditional students, like older students, single parents and workers who needed to gain additional skills, has increasingly become the college of choice for high school graduates.
 ''In recent years, the perception of W.C.C. has shifted somewhat,'' said Ms. Wisell. ''It's the college to which most Westchester high school graduates go.''
 For all that the county would seem to be the domain of those who choose big-name colleges and universities, the reality is that there is a large universe of students for whom cost and value come into play. High school graduates from affluent communities like Scarsdale, Chappaqua and Bronxville high schools are more than offset by graduates from Yonkers, New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and White Plains. And economics clearly plays a significant role even for many students who might be able to afford other schools.
 Hyun Tai Lew, for example, a second-year liberal arts and social sciences major from Scarsdale, said, ''W.C.C. is one of the cheapest rates for me.'' He plans to transfer to Wesleyan or New York University after he completes his associate's degree at the college. Many students who start at W.C.C. complete their education at Ivy League universities like Columbia, Cornell and Yale, or selective campuses like Stanford, as well as the state's four-year colleges.
 As Joseph Hankin, the president of the college, said: ''Fifty-four percent of all college students now start at community colleges. It's becoming more of a trend nationally. In the past, when we raised tuition by $100, we lost 1 percent of the enrollment. When tuition was raised about three years ago, there was no impact. It's still the best bargain around.''
 The college has about 12,000 students enrolled in for-credit programs, with an equivalent number who take non-credit continuing education courses. Its annual budget of $97.2 million is provided by the state, the county and student tuition payments; for the 2004-5 academic year, the county's share of the college's budget is $19.1 million, reflecting a subsidy of about 5.2 percent. The State Legislature has approved a per student subsidy of $50 at the state's community colleges. If that measure is not vetoed by the governor, the college would receive an additional $440,000 for its budget. Some staff positions remain unfilled and will depend on state financing and enrollment.
 The college also has increased its allocation of scholarships during the past few years, said Shirley Contino-Phillips, vice president of external affairs and director of the WCC Foundation. ''We give out about $750,000 a year, with the average scholarship about $1,500,'' she said. About 500 students receive scholarships annually. 
 ''I'm on financial aid, so am covered,'' said Nichole Justice-Hylton, a second-year student in the restaurant management program. Ms. Justice-Hylton, who is a student representative to the board of trustees, is a New Rochelle mother of two, attends school full time and works as a caterer. ''Students were in line with the increase, because we knew it wasn't done haphazardly or taken very lightly.'' Still, she said, ''We would rather that the county and state would pull their weight.''

HEADLINE: Shop, Walk, Work And Demonstrate

BYLINE: By LISA KELLER. 
Lisa Keller, an associate professor of history and director of the journalism program at Purchase College of the State University of New York, is writing a book about public order in 19th-century New York and London.

DATELINE: PURCHASE 

 BODY:
IN 1790, while New York City was still the capital of the United States, the first Congress passed the Bill of Rights, affirming our basic liberties as a free people: ''Congress shall make no lawabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.''
 The concept is simple, but the practice is complicated. In fact, there hasn't been an unlimited right to assemble in New York City for 130 years. 
 The current controversy about where protestors can demonstrate during the Republican National Convention, which kicks off tomorrow, is just the latest manifestation of a conflict that has been dividing the city for more than a century. In most big cities, it is difficult to find places to parade or to protest without interfering with the rights and needs of other residents. In New York City, where traffic, crowds and commerce are particularly intense, it is a near miracle that any kind of large public assembly is ever held. We demand to have our say anywhere and any time on any subject (particularly when we don't like something), but we also want to be able to shop, walk, work, travel and eat without disruption. 
 After the Civil War, New York became one of the first cities in the nation to require permits for individuals and groups seeking to use streets and parks for assembly or marches. Bitter lessons had been learned from the 1863 Draft Riots, which left more than 100 people dead and turned the city into chaos, and the 1871 Irish Orange Riots, which left more than 40 dead. The city decided it would allow public assembly only in controlled circumstances.
 The sources for that control lay not in the courts but with the city's municipal authorities -- mainly municipal agencies, politicians, police and influential citizens' groups -- representing a broad class, ethnic and religious spectrum. Their agenda was to keep order in the city, allowing it to function without economic disruption and preventing violence and loss of life.
 The timing of the decision to require permits in the early 1870's was no accident. Socialists, trade unionists and unemployed workers sought to redress economic and political grievances on city streets, and looked across the ocean to the model set by Londoners, who had seized Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park as the seats of vox populi. 
 The New York solution was a compromise reached after trial and error. It allowed some parks to be used, but changed that decision after excessive wear and tear. After the 1874 ''Blood or Bread'' melee in Tompkins Square Park, the city closed down the square as a site of protest for many decades. 
 However, in 1896, when a neighborhood association complained about the noise and disruption from Italian street parades, the police turned a deaf ear -- the parade organizers had legal permits. City authorities concluded that if they could control circumstances by setting clear conditions for meeting times and places through the permit, then disturbances to public peace, injury to individuals and interruptions to traffic and commerce could be avoided, while still allowing free assembly. Each permit request was individually determined, but no place and no time frame was ever absolute or guaranteed for public assembly. 
 The public during this period in the late 1800's had little legal recourse if denied a permit except to take to the streets and face arrest. 
 The turbulent 1920's and 1930's saw a proliferation of demonstrations and marches and much more debate over public assembly. In 1941, Robert Moses, who was parks commissioner at the time, banned a protest in Union Square Park, which prompted the New York Civil Liberties Committee to charge that he was changing city policy about demonstrations, misinterpreting the law and abridging the right of free speech. Citing a Supreme Court decision, Mr. Moses responded that the right to use a park was not absolute, especially if there was a likelihood of riot or fatalities. It was an old policy, he reminded the committee, and the city had usually managed to accommodate requests for public meetings.
 In 2004, a persistent fear of terrorism has added a new wrinkle to the long conflict between freedom and order in great cities. But we must remember that democracy is messy and that free speech is meaningless if we can only shout at 500 empty acres. We must accept the likelihood that some people will be late for work, some people will miss dinner, some grass will be trampled and some people will sit in snarled traffic. The founders of our republic knew that freedom and convenience did not go hand in hand, and they knew the consequences of limiting the right of assembly. 
 If we lose the right to speak our minds in Manhattan this week, then the city won't be worth the $24 that the early Dutch settlers allegedly paid the Indians for it in 1626.

HEADLINE: Staten Islanders' Tough Commutes

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Help for the M.T.A.'' (editorial, Aug. 15), you rightly state that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should focus on basic needs first. Under the advance plans proposed by the authority, the plight of Staten Islanders in particular will become unbearable.
 Staten Islanders face one of the longest commutes of any community in America, in many cases up to two hours each way by express bus. For many Staten Islanders the express buses to Manhattan are the only way to get to work, and raising these fares by 50 percent will surely cripple the economy on the island.
 In my own case, the combination of extremely long commuting hours and the very high commuting costs will tip the scales in favor of moving out of the island to one of the other boroughs. I am sure that my situation is not unique.

HEADLINE: The Weak Dollar And the Price of Oil

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Peril That Trails an Oil Shock'' (Gretchen Morgenson, Aug. 22), which looked at the potential economic damage from high oil prices:
 When it comes to the rising price of oil, the elephant in the room is the ever-weakening United States dollar. The persistent deficits (trade, current account, budget) are eating away at the strength of our currency. 
 Certainly, increased global demand for oil, threats of disruption to its supply and speculative buying are relevant causes for the climb in oil, but until this country begins to address the pervasiveness of debt in our economy stemming from the deficits and the easy-money policies of the Federal Reserve, then the dollar will continue to weaken and we will be forced to grapple with issues like the rising cost of commodities.

HEADLINE: SOME SUFFER MORE

 BODY:
The ebb tide of the 2001 recession and its aftermath didn't strand all boats equally, the government reported Thursday. Figures for 2003 released by the United States Census Bureau indicated that income inequality has grown since 2002. 
 In 2003, the bureau reported, the number of people considered poor and those without health insurance grew for the third straight year, and families near the bottom and middle were suffering the most.
 Some other inequities: In the South, the nation's poorest region, as well as in cities and among immigrants, pay didn't keep pace with inflation; single-parent families were the ones in which poverty rose most sharply; the gap in wages between men and women grew, and health-insurance coverage fell only for families earning less than $75,000 a year.

HEADLINE: A Declining Budget For Westchester Magnet

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

 BODY:
The loss of a $ 650,000 grant from the United States Department of Education means that the Westchester Magnet Academy, an alternative-type high school that serves 175 students from the Greenburgh Central 7, Harrison and Irvington school districts, will start the school year with a 25 percent decline in its operating budget, leading to cost-cutting measures in programming and staffing.
 The school, which opened in 2001 under the terms of a three-year, $2 million federal grant to bring together students from different ethnic and economic backgrounds, offers a Regents-based academic curriculum combined with hands-on activities and projects. 
 Without the grant, Westchester Magnet will be financed by the participating districts. The school also receives $300,000 from a state grant.
 There are other uncertainties as well. Although the program is currently situated on the Manhattanville College campus in Purchase, the college's trustees voted in June to end its relationship with the Westchester Magnet Academy after the current academic year.
 The school is working with Congresswoman Nita M. Lowey's office in an effort to restore some of the federal money, as well as seeking private donations and other grants, said Peter Lisi, assistant superintendent of the Greenburgh Central 7 school district.
 ''It's a very successful program,'' Mr. Lisi said. ''It offers an experiential approach to learning and the results have been very positive.'' MERRI ROSENBERG

HEADLINE: The Luxury Price Index

BYLINE: Reporting by Christine Muhlke with Jamie Wallis

 BODY:
Inflation now applies to more than just egos. Earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index for the New York metropolitan area ticked upward at a rate unseen in 14 years, led not by high gas prices but the 7 percent increase in the cost of spring clothing. The official index market basket contains 80,000 items -- everything from breakfast cereal to men's sweaters -- but it leaves out necessities of the moment like Balenciaga boots and Kabbalah water. We calculated the real change in the cost of luxury living in New York in the last year (tax included, but not tips) and came up with a whopping 53 percent increase! To wit:

BERKOWITZ, WILLIAM

 BODY:
 BERKOWITZ--William. Age 62, died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Sarasota, FL, on Sunday, August 22, 2004, after a long battle with cancer. Mr. Berkowitz, as President of one of the nation's first and largest retail Money Market Mutual Funds, Dreyfus Liquid Assets, helped to transform the way Americans save. As he told ''Forbes'' in 1980, ''...the savings public is becoming more sophisticated. It will not stand for this 5% rate on passbooks (savings accounts).'' He fought against the regulation of the money market industry and welcomed competition from banks by testifying in favor of lifting Regulation Q--which prevented banks from paying prevailing high interest rates on savings accounts. In 1964 a twenty-three year old William ''Bill'' Berkowitz came to work at The Dreyfus Corporation, the New York based investment management firm. By 1974 Bill Berkowitz had become an officer of The Dreyfus Corporation, and soon thereafter he created and became President of Dreyfus Liquid Assets, one of the first retail oriented Money Market Mutual Funds. Dreyfus' money market services and assets grew to a top industry position under his leadership. By 1981 most of Dreyfus' $12.4 billion of assets under management was in short-term money in over 300,000 accounts. Bill became President of the Reich & Tang, L.P. Mutual Funds Group and Executive Vice President and Director of Reich & Tang L.P. in 1982. The Mutual Funds Group grew rapidly under his leadership until 1994 when Reich & Tang, L.P. merged with the asset management division of the New England Companies, creating one of the largest investment management companies in the world. 
He was also a VicePresident and Board member of various third party mutual funds like Gabelli Asset Growth, Equitable Life's money market mutual funds and Speers, Benzak, Solomon and Farrell Funds. He was born September 20, 1941, in Bronx, NY. Before receiving his Bachelor of Science in Finance from New York University in 1963, he attended Syracuse University and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan in 1959. He lived in Middletown, NJ, and commuted to New York City for 16 years before moving to Sarasota, FL, in 1982. He retired from Reich and Tang, L.P. in 1994. Through the William and Dale S. Berkowitz Family Foundation and through invididual efforts, Bill supported the Flanzer Jewish Community Center of Sarasota, FL, and its Maccabi Games. He also supported the Florida Studio Theatre and the Sarasota YMCA Foundation. Bill was an avid art collector and a patron of a number of local Sarasota artists. Survivors include his beloved wife of 41 years, Dale S.; a daughter and son in law, Dana B. and John Snyder of Columbia, MD; sons and daughters in law David L. and Patti C. of Middletown, NJ, Barry J. and Chrissy of Potomac, MD, and Jeffrey A. and Susan of Sarasota; a sister Harriet Fortgang of Atlanta; and six grandchildren, Matthew, Dylan, Daniel, Bryce, Anna and Alexandra. Services and entombment were held on August 25, 2004, at the Palms Funeral Home and Memorial Park, 170 Honore Ave, Sarasota, FL 34232. Memorial donations may be made to Hospice of Southwest Florida, 5955 Rand Blvd, Sarasota, FL 34228.

HEADLINE: A Slowdown And Why It Matters

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS expect new data for August to show a slight slowdown in the manufacturing sector, which has been growing rapidly for nine months.
 The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index, due on Wednesday, is expected to slip to 60 from 62 in July, according to the consensus forecast from Bloomberg News. Because a reading of more than 50 generally means that the manufacturing sector is growing, a slip to 60 may not seem worrisome. 
 But while manufacturing accounts for only a small portion of overall economic growth, it plays an important role in some toss-up states in the presidential election campaign, which goes into full swing after the Republican National Convention this week.
 In addition, there are some signs, according to economists at Goldman Sachs, that manufacturing growth may slow further.
 Jan Hatzius, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a report to clients that Goldman expected the manufacturing index to fall to the mid-50's by the end of this year -- and maybe even lower next year.
 He bases that forecast on the performance of the inventory-to-sales ratio for durable goods. If this ratio is falling, inventories are declining relative to sales, meaning that production is too slow for current consumer demand and should increase, he said.
 When this ratio is rising, inventories are increasing relative to sales, meaning production is too high and consumer demand should slow.
 The July durable-goods data, released last week, show that the inventory-to-sales ratio is still declining, compared with its level in July a year ago.
 But the rate of the year-over-year declines has shrunk significantly, leading Mr. Hatzius to conclude that the pace of manufacturing growth will be slowing.
 The 4.7 percent decline in the ratio for July, compared with July 2003, is smaller than the declines of 8.2 percent for June and 10.3 percent for May. The July reading, he said, is consistent with a manufacturing-index level of about 54.

EMPLOYMENT WATCH -- Job growth in August, which will be reported on Friday, is expected to be way up from July, when only 32,000 jobs were created. But the Bloomberg forecast of 150,000 new payroll jobs is still below the monthly average of 177,000 this year.
 The predictions for August range from a high of 250,000 to a low of 50,000. For July, when the actual number was 32,000, the lowest forecast was 140,000. It is not clear what kind of impact there will be from Hurricane Charley, which ripped through parts of Florida at the end of the survey week for the August unemployment report.
 The jobs data comes out the morning after President Bush is scheduled to accept his party's nomination at the convention. Even with 250,000 new jobs in August, Mr. Bush would still need 919,000 more jobs by year-end to avoid a decline in employment during his current term.

HEADLINE: As Digest Goes the Way of Older Readers...

BYLINE: By CARIN RUBENSTEIN

DATELINE: PLEASANTVILLE 

 BODY:
PERHAPS as early as next month, the Reader's Digest Association will complete the sale of its 114-acre Chappaqua property, with all the ivy-draped, campuslike buildings that have housed the company's corporate headquarters since 1939.
 This is an ideal time, then, for a ''Word Power''(R) quiz -- any Digest readers will be familiar with this staple of the magazine -- to tackle terms revealing of the company's history. 
 Publishing colossus n. -- A Controls 20 different magazines, both in the United States and overseas. B The home of Reader's Digest, the world's most widely-read magazine, with a national circulation of 10 million, that is published in 60 countries and 19 languages. C Both. 
 Downsized staff n. -- A Headquarters that once housed 7,000 employees. B Staff that has atrophied to 800. C Both.
 Unbearable overhead n. -- A Expensive maintenance costs for 690,000 square feet of office space, as well as a 400-seat auditorium, a 5-bedroom guest house built in 1850, a garage and several smaller buildings. B Heat, air conditioning, electricity, lawn mowing. C Both.
 Monetized asset n. -- A Luxurious, well-situated property in pricey community. B Unused resource. C Both
 Sale/Leaseback n. -- A Sell for large sum of cash. B Reoccupy half. C Both.
 (Answers to all: C.) 
 The sale of the Reader's Digest property has been discussed publicly for nearly a year, and the buyer, whose identity has not yet been revealed, will probably pay $25 million to $30 million, according to experts familiar with the negotiations. 
 The new owner will lease about 300,000 square feet of space back to Reader's Digest for the next 20 years or so. That space will house the Reader's Digest corporate headquarters staff, which has dwindled down to about 800.
 This arrangement may not be quite what county officials were expecting, but they express relief that it will enable the Digest to stay put, even if in a reduced state.
 ''Anything that strengthens their position and keeps them in the county is important,'' said Theresa Waivada, deputy director of Westchester's Office of Economic Development. ''They are a wonderful source of employment as well as a source of philanthropy,'' she added.
 As for the buyers, they will be able to develop the rest of the property, either renting it to other businesses or building some kind of residential community, according to commercial real estate consultants, some of whom were early bidders on the property.
 ''From a corporate and investor standpoint, it makes sense,'' said Barry L. Lucas, a senior vice president for research at Gabelli & Co. in Rye, a financial-services company. ''They have a huge asset that's become substantially underutilized, and they have to find a way to extract some value from it while still being a good corporate citizen,'' said Mr. Lucas, whose company invests in Reader's Digest.
 ''It's not like they're putting a slaughterhouse or heavy manufacturing there,'' he added.
 But that doesn't mean there isn't trepidation in the area about what (and how much) will ultimately be built on all those acres of well groomed gardens and woods -- which are being sold with no preapproved zoning allowances.
 THE supervisor of the town of New Castle, Janet L. Wells, said that several prospective developers had presented plans before the town board early this summer, proposing to reuse the space as offices and as senior housing.
 The property is currently zoned for single occupant commercial use, she said, but because there has never before been a request for a zoning change of this kind, she has no idea how long it could take.
 ''We really did not want them to just divide it and put individual houses there,'' said Ms. Wells, who recalled that years ago, residents would deliberately avoid that part of the Saw Mill Parkway and Route 117 around 5 or 6 o'clock, when thousands of Digest employees headed home for the day.
 Nevertheless, several brokers, consultants and other experts theorized that ultimately, the property will not be used for commercial purposes.
 Because it is not in the more desirable White Plains and Route 287 corridor, said Robert P. Weisz, a developer, ''I think that the site might not easily convert into multitenant office space.'' Mr. Weisz owns RPW Group in White Plains 
 ''It's an ideal site for some form of residential development, and the rumors are it might be used for senior housing,'' added Mr. Weisz, who is planning to redevelop the former Kraft Foods International building in Rye Brook for commercial use.
 Mitchell Hochberg, a developer who owns WCI Spectrum Communities in Valhalla and was an initial bidder for the site, said, ''We looked at it to create an active adult, age-restricted community.'' 
 He added that developers are all too aware of the complex and troublesome zoning problems in the area -- especially the community's abiding fear of overcrowding in the Chappaqua schools and congestion on local roads.
 Mr. Hochberg said his original idea had been to build a clubhouse, pool, tennis courts and meeting facilities on the land. But obtaining permission to build new housing might have taken much longer than he was prepared to wait.
 ''Knowing Westchester and knowing New Castle,'' he added, ''it's not a risk we were willing to take. The entitlement process is very cumbersome, especially in the northern part of the county.''
 Joe Simone, president of Simone Development Company, in New Rochelle, an original bidder on the property, disagreed. He said that although the approval process would be tricky, it was ''definitely doable.''
 Still, he said, ''the buildings are dinosaurs, well-preserved dinosaurs that are in extremely good shape, but antiquated.'' Despite its Pleasantville mailing address, Reader's Digest is situated in Chappaqua on what looks, at first glance, to be an Ivy League college campus, complete with vine-covered brick walls and a working carillon.
 But the company publishes a pint-sized pamphlet that contains what might be more accurately described as a community college collection of supremely inoffensive jokes, word lists, forgettable characters, and novels reduced to Cliff Notes length, for reading in a doctor's waiting room or a bathroom.
 The August issue, for example, features stories on ''The 5 Natural Laws of Marriage,'' on cutting car costs, on food safety, and on the presidential candidates. Photographs of the two appear on the cover against the orange and gold glow of a sunrise (or, possibly, a sunset).
 There's also ''Life in These United States,'' a page of humorous stories, like the one about the woman who hesitated about getting a tattoo after she noticed that the tattoo artists were named Pane and Burns, or the woman in Florida who ordered a pizza delivered to her gated community only to find out that the teenager working in the pizza shop knew the gate code by heart.
 The company has other ventures as well, like Books are Fun, which discounts books and gifts, and magazines like Birds & Blooms, Quick Cooking, and Backyard Living, all published by Wisconsin-based Reiman Publications LLC, which the company acquired in 2002. The Pleasantville office is also headquarters of Selecciones, the Spanish edition of Reader's Digest, as well as the large-type edition of the magazine. 
 The first-ever edition was published in 1922, from an office on Minetta Lane in Greenwich Village, by DeWitt and Lila Acheson Wallace, who moved the business to Pleasantville the same year. In 1939, they relocated into the current building, at the time the first corporate headquarters in Westchester County.
 THE Wallaces bought the grounds between 1938 and 1940, with seven separate deeds, for a total of $44,545.45, said Steven J. Shaw, a spokesman for the Westchester County Clerk's office, after recently uncovering the original documents.
 The Wallaces, who had no children, channeled their energy into their company, and if they knew about the plans to sell and redevelop the land, ''they'd be broken-hearted,'' said Jean Craighead George, 85, who wrote for the Digest for 20 years. Ms. George, an author of children's books, says she knew Mr. Wallace, or ''Wally,'' as she refers to him, quite well.
 ''He adored that magazine, he believed in it, and he wanted it to go on forever,'' she said.
 One sign of that adoration was the paternalistic way the Wallaces ran their business. Alan Buzzetto, 57, began working for Reader's Digest in 1968, and fondly recalled those days.
 Mr. Wallace ''would come in his old Falcon station wagon, dressed like he was working in a garden, and stroll around,'' Mr. Buzzetto recalled.
 If Mr. Wallace had gone bowling, and was in a good mood that day, ''he'd raise everybody's salary 5 or 10 percent, and all the supervisors would have to redo their budgets,'' Mr. Buzzetto said. 
 Those were the times, he added, when the company held annual ''length of service'' dinners for longtime employees, and served cocktails and jumbo shrimp and gave away gifts like clocks, china and carving knives.
 When an employee died, a manager would hand-deliver a check for $5,000 to his home, on the same day, ''so the family wouldn't have to incur expenses,'' said Mr. Buzzetto.
 Andrew B. Jones, 83, who was an editor and writer for the Digest from 1954 to 1986, seemed to sum up many old-timers' reactions when he said the Wallaces ''would be turning over in their graves'' if they knew about the sale. 
 ''They were hard-nosed, they ran it their way, and their way was the right way,'' he concluded. 
 By staying in the county, the company will end up paying market rate for its own old office space, said Mitchell Konsker, executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield in Manhattan, the real estate agency that is handling the deal, although he would not specify the terms of the possible lease.
 But Carl Austin, president of Austin Corporate Properties in Rye Brook, an area leasing broker for 33 years, theorized that ''Reader's Digest will probably be paying in the mid to high teens per square foot.'' That would come out to about $5.4 million annually, he added, a fair price for a somewhat isolated location with beautiful grounds.
 THE company went public in 1990, when Reader's Digest sold shares at an initial public offering for $21.50 each. The stock now sells for about $14 a share, down from a four-year high of $40 in 2000.
 Analysts now rate the stock ''neutral'' (as opposed to ''buy'' or ''sell''), in part because the company's near-term prospects are so mixed, according to Karl Choi, a Merrill Lynch analyst in Manhattan, who reports on Reader's Digest every quarter and says he will probably issue a special report when the property is sold.
 The company's debt, which was nearly $1 billion in 2002, when it bought Reiman Publications for $760 million, has been reduced to less than $700 million, and will probably be below $500 million by the end of fiscal year 2005, according to William Adler, a company spokesman. 
 Thomas O. Ryder, the Digest's chief executive, took over in 1998, and was instrumental in selling 38 pieces of art, originally bought by the Wallaces, that brought in nearly $100 million at a Sotheby's auction. The company still owns about 5,000 lesser works from the Wallaces' collection, many displayed at the corporate headquarters in Pleasantville.
 Security is fairly tight; the property's single entrance is always guarded, Mr. Adler said, and about a dozen guards patrol the grounds. 
 The sale of the property is just one further symptom of the strategic shift in the company's business plan -- from personal and paternalistic to modern and publicly owned, according to Mr. Lucas, the Gabelli analyst. 
 ''All the cliches about turning a battleship around do apply,'' he said. 
 The franchise was perhaps not as rock solid and permanent as the current management had hoped, he noted. Part of the problem is the magazine's aging readership, about which industry analysts joked that the average reader's age was dead.
 Still, the Digest is known for the size and loyalty of its customer database -- 50 million households, many of them originally recruited through sweepstakes promotions, a method phased out in the United States as a result of pressure from lawsuits filed in 32 states alleging deceptive practices. 
 Whatever happens in the coming months and years, many of those who worked for the Wallaces agreed about how they would have reacted to recent events in Pleasantville.
 They ''saw the magazine as a public service, as a way to educate their readers,'' said Peter C. Canning, a former Digest managing editor who has written an adoring book about the Wallaces.
 He recalled an incident one weekend that revealed much about the Wallace work ethic and attitude toward money.
 Mr. Wallace had noticed trash on the tracks at Mount Kisco's train station, and asked the magazine's editors, including Mr. Canning, to show up early on a Saturday morning to clean up. 
 Mr. Canning found a $5 bill on the tracks and showed it to his boss, who was thrilled.
 ''He said, 'Peter, we should do this every day, we'll get rich,''' Mr. Canning recalled, adding, ''I said, 'You're already rich.''' 

The Old-Fashioned Way to Launder Money
 IN the old days, Reader's Digest had so much money it couldn't give it away fast enough.
 During the mid-1980's, the company mailed 26 million to 28 million nickels to subscribers of Reader's Digest, to persuade them to subscribe to condensed books, according to Alan Buzzetto, who was supervisor of promotion order intake at the time. That is nearly $1.5 million. 
 Why nickels, exactly?
 Nickels produced the best response rate, it turns out. 
 After prodigious testing of every kind of coin, staff researchers discovered that the nickel ''was the best order device available,'' Mr. Buzzetto said, because it was the one people were least tempted to keep. About 10 percent of them returned the coins, he said.
 Each nickel was glued inside the transparent cellophane window of a business return envelope, so the potential subscriber could see it before assuming it was junk mail and throwing it out. If the subscriber wanted to receive condensed books, he or she opened the envelope, unstuck the nickel from the mailer and returned it in a pouch, along with a name-and-address label.
 Nobody in marketing, however, had thought ahead about what the company would do with the mountains of sticky nickels returned by millions of would-be condensed-book customers. To open pouches, collect mailing labels and separate out the nickels, Mr. Buzzetto ended up having to hire 400 people. He put them to work in three shifts around the clock, for a project that ultimately took six weeks. During that time, Mr. Buzzetto estimated, he received two million to three million sticky nickels -- too large a quantity to fit into his first-floor office. The temporary workers put the nickels in boxes, which they stacked on pallets, which they stored in at least three tractor trailers, which the company rented and parked in the Reader's Digest loading dock.
 It quickly became apparent that the hardest part of the chore was separating out the nickels. Besides, the few hundred that had been successfully separated were not being accepted at the bank anyway. They were still too sticky. 
 So he improvised. He decided to take away the paper and glue from the nickels en masse, instead of one at a time. 
 He bought a washer and a dryer and installed them in the basement at Reader's Digest. His employees threw the mailers into the washing machine, which turned them into pulp plus coins. The pulp was washed away in the rinse cycle; the newly laundered nickels remained.
 The process worked just fine, Mr. Buzzetto said, although at first, ''It made the nickels smaller, because the inside of the machine would wear the nickels down.'' Maintenance workers removed the agitator in the center of the washing machine, and replaced it with a flat wooden paddle, which was kinder to the coins.
 But the nickels also had to be dried, because after they were washed, they were too wet -- which would make them too rusty to be bankable.
 After the first few days of nickel cleaning, the paper pulp clogged all the drains in the building, flooded the basement and backed up the company's septic system, Mr. Buzzetto recalled.
 In addition, some of the nickels, before cleaning, had been liberated by the temporary employees, who had used them in the company vending machines, Mr. Buzzetto said. Many of those sticky coins jammed in the machines, which then needed extensive repairs.
 Then there was the issue of working conditions. Although the nickel laundry facility was fairly effective, it was also hot and poorly ventilated, so workers tended to strip down to their underwear.
 One day, Mr. Buzzetto said, corporate executives in suits and ties visited the room, and were shocked to see teams of nearly naked Reader's Digest employees. The next day, the company sent official Reader's Digest T-shirts and shorts, free of charge, to clothe the sweaty workers.
 Eventually, Mr. Buzzetto said, the nickel operation became just too onerous, and the company outsourced the nickel retrieval task to a Texas firm that employed illegal Mexican immigrants, paying them 2 cents on the nickel.
 Mr. Buzzetto was laid off in 1990 after 28 years at Reader's Digest. He now lives in Salisbury, Md., and works a 12-hour night shift as a corrections officer. CARIN RUBENSTEIN

HEADLINE: Xanadu Moves Ahead, but With Asterisks

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: Lyndhurst 

 BODY:
THE New Jersey Meadowlands Commission gave its blessing last week to the planned development of the $1.3 billion Meadowlands Xanadu family entertainment and sports complex. But it leavened that approval with more than a dozen recommendations for changes, including many that echoed the long-voiced criticisms of the plan's opponents. 
 The 5-0 vote (with one abstention) paved the way for the scheduled groundbreaking ceremony on Sept. 29 for the 104-acre project that is to be built by a partnership of the Mills Corporation, a mall developer; Mack-Cali Realty Corporation; and the KanAm Group, a Munich investment group. 
 From the start, the project -- five million square feet of activities and shopping that will include an indoor ski slope, a surfing pool and mini-Formula One racetrack -- has had the strong backing of the McGreevey administration. 
 The governor at one time saw it as a gift to the long-neglected blue-collar communities in southern Bergen County, and as a way to make Democratic inroads in a once reliably Republican county. 
 But perhaps most significant about the commission's vote was that it signaled the start of the tough effort to come in making final the details of the lease between the developers and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which owns the land for the project. Permits to allow building must also come from the state's Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Transportation and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
 It was to these more detailed discussions that the Meadowlands Commission directed its 14 recommendations for changes and modifications. They range from how to define the project's retail component and its actual impact on traffic, to the recommendation that developers be required to build costly air-monitoring stations on the site and a sewage-treatment plant and finance a shuttle-bus service that would serve the site until a proposed heavy-rail spur was built.
 Susan Bass Levin, chairman of the commission and commissioner of the state's Division of Community Affairs, conceded that the recommendations of the agency's hearing officers were full of misgivings and caveats.
 But she said that by approving the proposal with the recommendations, the commission was seizing the opportunity to set out what it expects from the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the D.E.P. and the D.O.T. in their ongoing dealings with the developers. 
 In return, the commission was keeping alive a project that would bring jobs, economic development and tax revenue to the region. In addition it would allow the immediate payment of $160 million to the state by the developers who would also turn over to the commission some 587 acres of untouched wetlands they own adjacent to the site; that land would be held by a conservation trust.
 This is an essential element of the plan, Ms. Bass Levin said. She added that the commission was charged with making sure that the project complements the public's need for jobs, economic development and smart-growth policies that protect the environment.
 Despite the recommendations and caveats made by the commission, many critics of the development were unimpressed. 
 Edward Lloyd, a lawyer who represents a number of environmental and mass transit advocate groups, said that enforceability of the recommendations was crucial. He accused the developers of creating the questions that were unanswered by ''stonewalling'' public agencies in the nearly two years since they were chosen to develop the tract. ''They should not be rewarded for their arrogance,'' he said, calling on the commission to delay acting on the project.
 Allen Magrini, a vice president and general counsel for Hartz Mountain Industries, one of the unsuccessful bidders to develop the site, said that all the unanswered questions about the project grew out of a process that was not as rigorous as it should have been. And the recommendations from the commission's hearing officers were ''too soft and unenforceable'' to affect the process. 
 Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter, referring to the commission's meeting last Thursday, said: ''This is public relations and not public policy. We need to reopen the entire environment impact statement to get the answers we need on air quality and traffic and water. There are a lot of changes going on in New Jersey now, but gridlock is forever.''
 Bob Sommer, a spokesman for the developers, disputed any suggestion that the approval process was anything but open and thorough.

HEADLINE: Can This Relationship Be Saved?

BYLINE: By DAVID GERGEN. 
David Gergen is professor of public service at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and editor at large of U.S. News & World Report. He served as a White House adviser to four presidents.

 BODY:
FROM his hospital bed just after he was shot, Ronald Reagan recalled a line from W. C. Fields and scribbled off a note to a nurse: ''All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.'' As Republicans gather in New York City this week, many are probably thinking the same thing: despite all the fun, they'd rather be somewhere else. And many New Yorkers agree.
 The party and the city went through a nasty divorce decades ago, and their relationship has been rocky since. Sometimes they kiss and make up, but it never lasts. When George W. Bush stood amid the rubble at the World Trade Center and shouted through his bullhorn to firefighters who couldn't hear him over the din, ''I can hear you; the rest of the world hears you,'' romance was in the air again. Soon after, the party scheduled its convention in the city, a first for the G.O.P. White House aides quietly told each other the president had a good chance of winning New York in 2004. 
 But since then, it's been splitsville. Washington was slow to pony up the $20 billion promised by Mr. Bush for reconstruction, and New Yorkers have felt cheated that even now Wyoming receives more than six times as much per person in counterterrorism grants as New York State. Representative Tom DeLay, the Republican New Yorkers may resent most, added insult when he tried to bring a cruise ship here so delegates could avoid city hotels.
 Rude surprises have often characterized the relationship. I became personally involved in one when the city, nearly bankrupt, asked President Ford in 1975 for a financial bailout through loan guarantees. Mr. Ford was one of those moderate Republicans who actually liked New York -- remember that he picked Nelson Rockefeller as his vice president -- but he was offended by the city's profligate spending and decided to say no in a speech that October. 
 The president's speechwriters whipped up one draft, and I was asked by the White House chief of staff to write an alternative version from my perch as an assistant to Treasury Secretary Bill Simon. I wrote a hard-hitting piece, assuming that if it ever saw the light of day, the White House would, in the normal course, invite me to smooth the rough edges. Instead, someone plopped a few of my rough, unedited paragraphs into the final text. ''The people of this country will not be stampeded,'' President Ford said. ''They will not panic when a few desperate New York officials and bankers try to scare New York's mortgage payments out of them.''
 It was a doozy of a speech, but events caught both sides by surprise. The next morning's Daily News carried the now famous, front-page headline: ''Ford to City: Drop Dead.'' New Yorkers had not foreseen how tough the president would be, and Republicans in Washington had not anticipated how angry the response would be. Democrats rushed to exploit the wounds in their ads, and Jimmy Carter won New York State by a close margin that fall, a pivotal loss for Mr. Ford. Tensions and misunderstanding between the party and the city are now woven into the fabric of politics.
 It wasn't always this way. While Republicans won few elections in the city during the first 50 years after the party was created in the 1850's, many found it a promising environment. From 1900 to 1956, a New Yorker was on the Republican ticket as the presidential or vice-presidential nominee in 10 of 15 elections. 
 Divorce came in the 1960's as the city's voters drifted left and Republicans moved sharply right. In 1964, Barry Goldwater cracked that he would be happy to saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea. His delegates at the Republican convention that year lustily booed Governor Rockefeller. In the past nine elections, only one New York Republican, Jack Kemp, has been on the national ticket.
 In presidential politics, New York is now a distinctly blue state, and New York City is among the bluest of big cities, giving big margins to the Democrats. New Yorkers obviously haven't rejected all Republicans: George Pataki, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Bloomberg all won under the G.O.P. banner. But they are a different breed from the social and economic conservatives who dominate the national party.
 Delegates coming to the convention this week are likely to have a terrific time. They will salute with pride the spirit of 9/11, and they will praise Mr. Giuliani, the police and the firefighters. But underneath, many will still look at the city as Sodom and Gomorrah; they will view its politics and media as hopelessly left; and some wouldn't mind having a crack at Goldwater's saw. All in all, a good many would rather be at the site of their last convention, Philadelphia.

I. A Long Way From Philadelphia
I really wouldn't be surprised if you can't remember a thing about the 2000 Republican convention in Philadelphia. I was there, and I'm paid to pay close attention to these things, and I have only the gauziest recollections. According to my notes, it opened with a Hispanic girl singing the national anthem. Then there was a video of a black Baptist minister preaching from the pulpit of his church, and there was a Mexican dancer with a big sombrero. Chaka Khan sang a rousing finale. I remember joking that with all the whites in the audience and all the minority performers onstage, the whole thing looked like a Utah Jazz basketball game.
 This was a party trying to shake off the harsh aura of Gingrichism. The daddy party was trying to show it had a mommy side too. Laura Bush delivered her speech in front of a bank of school desks, with charming, immobile kids arrayed behind her, and announced that her husband would strengthen Head Start. Colin Powell praised George W. Bush for making education the centerpiece of his campaign. Bush came on and saluted Mary Jo Copeland, whose ministry, Sharing and Caring Hands, serves meals to the homeless.
 In his acceptance speech, Bush noted that his father's generation had been called upon to fight epic battles against great foes. That, he said, was the ''generation of Americans who stormed beaches, liberated concentration camps and delivered us from evil.'' But we, he continued, are living in a time of blessing. So instead of fighting wars, we're called to perform ''small, unnumbered acts of caring and courage and self-denial.'' The emphasis was on the word ''small.'' This was a convention about intimate connections, local associations, tender emotions and domestic concerns. ''Sometimes, we are called to do great things,'' Bush later said. ''But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love.''
 The 2004 convention is taking place in New York, only 80 miles away from the last one, but in a different universe. All Americans have been forced to pass through the portal marked by Sept. 11. As you look out at the delegates to this year's G.O.P. gathering, remember that these folks have fallen down a chute, and they have no idea where it lets out. When they nominated George Bush in 2000, they had no idea that Mr. Small Acts of Compassion was going to be transformed into Mr. Epic War Against Evil. They had no idea they were nominating a guy who was going to embark on a generational challenge to transform the Middle East. They had no idea they were nominating a guy who would create a huge new cabinet department for homeland security, who would not try to cut even a single government agency, who would be the first president in a generation to create a new entitlement program, the prescription drug benefit, projected to cost $534 billion over the next 10 years. They had no idea that a Republican-led government would spend federal dollars with an alacrity that Clinton never dreamed of, would create large deficits, would significantly increase the federal role in education, would increase farm subsidies, would pass campaign-finance reform and would temporarily impose tariffs on steel.
 The Republicans who gather in New York this week love George Bush. They admire the stalwart way he has fought the war on terror. They understand why, post-Sept. 11, he has governed the way he has. But they are a little shellshocked by the unexpected transformation that has come over their party, and they do not know how it is going to turn out. 
 Democrats may imagine that the G.O.P. is an amalgam of fat cats and conservative ideologues, but things feel different inside Republican circles. Inside there are, beneath the cheering and the resolve, waves of anxiety, uncertainty and disagreement. You hang around Republicans, and you begin to hear all sorts of discordant things. Jesse Helms recently remarked he wouldn't have voted for the tax cut if he'd known how bad the deficit would become. Three of the senior right-wing columnists -- George F. Will, Robert Novak and William F. Buckley Jr. -- have come out, in their different ways, against the war in Iraq. I had lunch recently with a senior Republican official who said his party had succumbed; it was ''defeatist'' about reducing the size of government. As Will himself has observed, under President Bush, American conservatism is undergoing an identity crisis.
 There used to be a spirit of solidarity binding all the embattled members of the conservative movement. But with conservatism ascendant, that spirit has eroded. Should Bush lose, it will be like a pack of wolves that suddenly turns on itself. The civil war over the future of the party will be ruthless and bloody. The foreign-policy realists will battle the democracy-promoting Reaganites. The immigrant-bashing nativists will battle the free marketeers. The tax-cutting growth wing will battle the fiscally prudent deficit hawks. The social conservatives will war with the social moderates, the biotech skeptics with the biotech enthusiasts, the K Street corporatists with the tariff-loving populists, the civil libertarians with the security-minded Ashcroftians. In short, the Republican Party is unstable. 
 Whether the Republicans win or lose in November, the party of 2008 is not going to look like the party of 2004, any more than the party of 2004 looks like the party of 2000. Parties change radically, even while remaining true to some essential nature. The Republican Party is in the midst of that kind of change; the transition is nowhere near complete. 

II.The Death of Small-Government Conservatism
Two big forces are driving the change. The first, obviously, is the war on Islamic extremism. As the historian Bruce Catton once observed: ''A singular fact about modern war is that it takes charge. Once begun it has to be carried to its conclusion, and carrying it there sets in motion events that may be beyond men's control. Doing what has to be done to win, men perform acts that alter the very soil in which society's roots are nourished.''
 The second and more pervasive change is the death of socialism. Everybody can see how the collapse of the socialist dream has transformed left-wing parties like the British Labor Party. But, as David Frum observes, the death of socialism has transformed the Republican Party just as much as it has transformed the parties of the left.
 For most of the 20th century, the conservative movement and the Republican Party were built to combat the inexorable spread of big government. Faced with that great threat, Republicans became Jeffersonian. If the left was going to embrace larger welfare states, the Republicans were going to become enthusiastic decentralizers, suspicious of concentrated power, the foes of big government. Anti-government sentiment was the glue that held the different factions of the American right together. And in that great cause the G.O.P. -- from Coolidge to Goldwater to Reagan -- was successful. Conservatives and libertarians defeated socialism, intellectually and then practically. 
 Socialism has stopped its march. Now almost every leading politician accepts that government should not interfere with the basic mechanisms of the market system. On the other hand, almost every leading official acknowledges that we should have as much of a welfare state as we can afford. Now the debate over the role of the state takes place within much narrower parameters. 
 The federal government has consumed roughly the same proportion of national wealth for three decades. The Clinton administration tried to increase significantly the size of government with its health care plan and was thrown back. Newt Gingrich tried to reduce significantly the size of government, and he, too, was thrown back. We will still argue about budgets, about new government programs and new tax cuts, but the size-of-government debate will not be the organizing conflict of the 21st century, the way it was for the 20th. Just as socialism will no longer be the guiding goal for the left, reducing the size of government cannot be the governing philosophy for the next generation of conservatives, as the Republican Party is only now beginning to understand. 
 If you want to put a death date on the tombstone of small-government Republicanism, it would be Nov. 14, 1995. That was the day the new G.O.P. majority shut down the government. Gingrich, Dick Armey and others came to power with a list of hundreds of government programs and agencies they wanted to eliminate, including the Departments of Commerce, Energy and Education. They led what Grover Norquist called the Leave Us Alone coalition, the alliance of all those different Americans who wanted government to get out of their lives. Gingrich vowed to show the world ''how to end programs, not just create them.'' Republicans welcomed a showdown over the size of government because they were convinced that the public would be on their side. Faxes came over the machines vowing, ''No Compromise.'' Senator Phil Gramm celebrated the shutdown. ''Have you really noticed a difference?'' he reportedly asked.
 The public did notice, as it turned out, and they didn't like it. Within a few years the Republicans were backtracking so furiously they were proposing to spend more money on the Department of Education than the Clinton administration thought to ask for. 

III. Muddling Toward a Governing Philosophy
So now we have two sorts of Republicans. The first group is made up of people who still mouth the words about reducing the size of government but don't even pretend to live according to their creed. These Republicans, mostly in Congress, go home to their states and districts and rail against Washington and big government. Then when they get back to Capitol Hill they behave like members of any majority party. They try to use their control over the federal purse to buy votes. They embrace appropriations and champion pork with an enthusiasm that makes your eyes pop.
 For them, the old anti-statist governing philosophy exists in the airy-fairy realm of ideals. When it actually comes time to make some decisions about priorities and spending, they have no governing philosophy and hence no discipline. The money just splurges out. ''The current version of the Republican Party is engaged in an outrageous spending binge, and they're being steadied and encouraged by Democrats,'' John McCain observed recently. 
 The money is appropriated in increments large and small -- a $180 billion corporate tax bill one week, a steady stream of pork projects all the rest. In 1994, there were 4,126 ''earmarks'' -- special spending provisions -- attached to the 13 annual appropriations bills. In 2004, there were around 14,000. Real federal spending on the Departments of Education, Commerce and Health and Human Services has roughly doubled since the Republicans took control of the House in 1994. This is a governing majority without shape, coherence or discipline.
 The second group of Republicans is at least trying to come up with a governing philosophy that applies to the times. It understands the paradox that if you don't have a positive vision of government, you won't be able to limit the growth of government. If you can't offer people a vision of what government should do, you won't be able to persuade them about the things it shouldn't do. If the Republican Party is going to evolve into a principled majority party, members of this group are going to have to build a governing philosophy based on this insight. 
 To his credit, George Bush falls into this latter category. By the time he began his campaign for president in 1999, Bush understood that the simple government-is-the-problem philosophy of the older Republicans was obsolete. During that campaign, Bush criticized what he called the ''destructive mind-set: the idea that if government would only get out of our way, all our problems would be solved. An approach with no higher goal, no nobler purpose, than 'Leave us alone.' '' Instead, Bush argued, ''government must be carefully limited but strong and active.''
 In another speech, Bush noted, ''Too often, my party has confused the need for limited government with a disdain for government itself.'' He continued: ''Our founders rejected cynicism and cultivated a noble love of country. That love is undermined by sprawling, arrogant, aimless government. It is restored by focused and effective and energetic government.'' 
 Compassionate conservatism was his attempt to come up with a new governing philosophy, a set of beliefs to guide Republicans as they tried to figure out what to do with power. Unfortunately, compassionate conservatism turned out to be a pretty thin tissue, and it was incinerated by the events of Sept. 11.
 Since then, the Bush administration, while focusing on the war on terror, has been muddling toward a more appropriate governing philosophy. As Daniel Casse observed recently in Commentary magazine, ''It is impossible to ignore the ways in which the sometimes surprising and unorthodox politics [Bush] has been advancing, albeit unevenly, have created a new type of conservative agenda.''
 On domestic policy, Casse writes, the Bush administration has agreed to greater federal spending in exchange for the seeds of market reform -- a big prescription drug benefit in exchange for the hint of a new approach to Medicare that emphasizes choice and accountability. This is not traditional big government, nor is it small government. It is strong government, Casse writes, which provides services while giving individuals choice about how they want them delivered.
 This sort of conservatism measures its success not by how big or small government is but by the habits it encourages in its citizens. Does it encourage dependence or self-reliance? Does it sap individual initiative or give it new forums to exert itself? As Jonathan Rauch wrote in The National Journal: ''Conservatives have been obsessed with reducing the supply of government when instead they should reduce the demand for it; and the way to do that is by repudiating the Washington-knows-best legacy of the New Deal. Republicans will empower people, and the people will empower Republicans.''
 Bush himself seems to agree. On July 21 he noted that while ''government should never try to control or dominate the lives of our citizens,'' nonetheless, ''government can and should help citizens gain the tools to make their own choices.''
 This is not yet a governing philosophy. It is not yet a new identity for American conservatism. It is not yet an updated conservative agenda. But it is a glimmer of these things. It is the first glimpse of the sort of Republican Party we could see when the convention rolls around again in 2008.
 Nobody knows who the nominee will be that year. It could be Bill Frist, Chuck Hagel, Rudy Giuliani, Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado or somebody else -- maybe even Arnold Schwarzenegger. But if the party is going to offer a positive, authoritative vision for the post-9/11 world, which is a world of conflict and anxiety, then it is going to have to develop a strong-government philosophy consistent with Republican principles. It will have to embrace a progressive conservative agenda more ambitious and fully developed than anything the Bush administration has so far articulated.
 A candidate who does that would not need to launch an insurgency campaign against the Republican establishment, the way Goldwater did in 1964 or the way Reagan did in 1976. The fact is the Republican Party no longer has a coherent establishment left to inveigh against. Instead, a progressive conservative candidate would have to play a more constructive role. He would have to lay out a vision that would rebuild the bonds among free-market conservatives, who dream of liberty; social conservatives, who dream of decency; middle-class suburbanites, who dream of opportunity; and foreign-policy hawks, who dream of security and democracy. He would have to revive and update the governing philosophy that did bind these groups, and did offer such hope, in the early days of the G.O.P. Long before it was the party of Tom DeLay, the G.O.P. was a strong government/progressive conservative party. It was the party of Lincoln, and thus of Hamilton. Today, in other words, the Republican Party doesn't need another revolution. It just needs a revival. It needs to learn from the ideas that shaped the party when it was born.

IV. What Would Hamilton Do?
Today we have one political tradition, now housed in the Democratic Party, which believes in using government in the name of equality and social justice. We have another tradition, recently housed in the Republican Party, which believes, or says it believes, in restricting the size of government in the name of freedom and personal responsibility. But through much of American history there has always been a third tradition, now dormant, which believes in limited but energetic government in the name of social mobility and national union.
 This third tradition was founded by Alexander Hamilton, embraced by Henry Clay and the Whig Party, taken up by Abraham Lincoln and the early Republican Party and brought into the 20th century by Theodore Roosevelt. It withered during the great 20th-century debate over the size of government (its philosophy was confusedly crossways to this debate), but it is this tradition the Republicans must embrace if they are to become the majority party for the next few decades.
 This progressive conservative tradition is built on an admiration for a certain sort of individual: the young, ambitious striver, who works hard, makes something of himself, creates opportunities for others and then goes on to advance America's unique mission in the world. Alexander Hamilton was the first embodiment and definer of this creed. Hamilton came from nothing and spent his political career trying to create a world in which as many people as possible could replicate his amazing success.
 Hamilton looked around after independence and saw a country destined to become the greatest empire of the earth (as he put it) but burdened with institutions that retarded social mobility and stifled development. The American economy was still mainly an agricultural economy, which trapped talented young people on the farm, where they could not cultivate the full range of their talents. Then there were the aristocratic families like Thomas Jefferson's, which exercised stranglehold control over the country's economic life.
 Hamilton sought to smash all that, to liberate and stir Americans to exploit the full range of their capacities. As he wrote in his ''Report on Manufactures,'' ''To cherish and stimulate the activity of the human mind, by multiplying the objects of enterprise, is not among the least considerable of the expedients, by which the wealth of a nation may be promoted. . . . Every new scene, which is opened to the busy nature of man to rouse and exert itself, is the addition of a new energy to the general stock of effort.'' Hamilton believed that people had inside them vast wells of untapped resources, and that it was the job of government to open up opportunities, to arouse, stimulate and cultivate an energetic populace so citizens could compete with one another. 
 First Hamilton had to break up the vested interests that encrusted American life. He did this, in part, by nationalizing the Revolutionary War debt. This, he said, would fuse the many insular local economies into one dynamic national economy. It would also lead to thriving credit markets. It would shift power away from the local landowners to commercial traders, who would move capital around looking for investment opportunities. Hamilton also created the Bank of the United States, to finance investments. He organized what we would now call federal scientific research. 
 He believed, in other words, in using government to enhance market dynamism by fostering more equitable competition. He believed government could usefully promote social revolutions, in his case the move from an agricultural to a commercial economy. In short, he rejected the formula, assumed too often today, that you can be for government or for the market, but not for both.
 For his part, Hamilton saw entrepreneurial freedom, limited but energetic federal power and national greatness as qualities that were inextricably linked. It was always the cause of America, or rather, the cause America represents -- universal freedom -- that was uppermost in his mind. Hamiltonianism was about spurring individual initiative, but it was also about gathering the fruits of that energy in the cause of national greatness. 
 After Hamilton's death, the Hamiltonian spirit was carried on by the Whig Party. Self-conscious Hamiltonians like Henry Clay and Daniel Webster sought to apply Hamiltonian principles to their own day. Abraham Lincoln came of age in the Whig Party, inherited Hamiltonian understandings of economics and the nation and infused the Republican Party, founded in the 1850's, with those ideas and causes. Lincoln's program was based on a conception of man as laborer and climber. As the historian Gabor S. Boritt has written, ''Lincoln probably talked more about economics, to use the term in a broad sense, than any other issue, slavery included.'' Lincoln's first fully published speech was about banking. His first political pamphlet was about how to encourage national banks. His first address at a national forum was on how to stimulate economic growth. Even during the Civil War, Lincoln predicted, ''Finance will rule the country for the next 50 years.''
 That was not a dour warning. In true Hamiltonian fashion, Lincoln embraced banking and finance capitalism because he saw bank credit as a new source of energy for American society. Around him, most of his countrymen opposed the spread of banks as the symbols and gestation centers for this new economic system, commercial-industrial capitalism, which threatened to upend old pastoral ways of living. But Lincoln spent much of his time as a state legislator supporting an Illinois bank, a local version of Hamilton's national bank.
 Like Hamilton, Lincoln rose from obscurity to greatness; like Hamilton, he dreaded the thudding repetition of farm life; and like Hamilton he was obsessed with self-transformation and social mobility. Lincoln embraced the idea that each of us has a mission to work hard and get ahead. ''I hold the value of life is to improve one's condition,'' he declared in 1861.
 His second great cause as a young politician was canal-building. Like Hamilton, he was an ardent champion of ''internal improvements'' and lobbied vigorously for a canal to be built to improve the navigability of the Sangamon River, because he thought it would replace the torpid, pastoral economy of his region with a humming, churning new economy, which would lure immigrants and create economic opportunity. 
 Like Hamilton, Lincoln was indifferent to his own wealth. Rather, he wanted economic development because it meant more fluidity, more competition, more opportunity. For him, the market was admirable because it cultivated a certain sort of upward-climbing individual. 
 This free-labor ideology was a contract. Individuals would be held responsible for their own behavior. But government would do what it could to open up opportunities, so that people would have second and third and fourth chances to succeed. During Lincoln's presidency, this government philosophy produced a raft of legislation: the creation of a single currency, the Homestead Act, the Morrill Land Grant College Act, the railroad legislation and so on. All of these initiatives were designed to stimulate, energize and unify the nation. The Homestead Act placed land in the hands of families. The Land Grant College Act promoted the spread of practical knowledge. These Republicans were not trying to care for the downtrodden or shelter them. They were trying to open fields of enterprise.
 They acted even though they were skeptical about federal power. They knew about cultures of dependency and how they could grow; they worried that public or private charity, even for basic supplies like food, would corrode habits of self-reliance. They were just as suspicious of government bureaucracy as today's Republicans are. But still they acted. 
 They acted because no social transformation is without its dark side. Industrialism was wreaking havoc on some communities, even as it improved others. It was dislocating thousands. The early Republicans sought to open up new lands and new opportunities so those on the losing end of the Industrial Revolution would have new places to succeed.
 The next great figure in this tradition was Theodore Roosevelt. He, too, believed in the marriage of individual economic opportunity with political and cultural union. He believed in the character-building force of competition, its ability to produce individuals who possessed the vigorous virtues he lauded in his 1905 inaugural address: ''energy, self-reliance and individual initiative.'' 
 Roosevelt, too, believed that government must sometimes play an active role to give everybody a fair shot in the race of life. ''The true function of the state, as it interferes with social life,'' he wrote, ''should be to make the chances of competition more even, not to abolish them.'' In his day, corporate corruption was as big a threat to free competition as socialist revolution, and Roosevelt detested both. As he observed,''Every new social relation begets a new type of wrongdoing -- of sin, to use an old-fashioned word -- and many years always elapse before society is able to turn this sin into a crime which can be effectively punished by law.'' 
 Roosevelt was an ardent champion of reform, believing that a corrupt and ineffective government would breed cynicism and despondency. He believed in aggressive policies to preserve national cohesion; to strengthen the bonds nourished by our culture and national environment. He believed in America's unique mission in world history. As he argued in his famous Strenuous Life speech at a Hamilton Club in 1899, ''We cannot sit huddled within our borders and avow ourselves merely an assemblage of well-to-do hucksters who care nothing for what happens beyond.'' He increased the number of American battleships from 9 to 25 and more than doubled the number of sailors, so the U.S. could project power around the world. He was an ardent nationalist.
 Of course Hamilton, Lincoln and Roosevelt were complicated individuals whose careers contained diverse and sometimes conflicting strands. But they do belong in one tradition, a tradition newly appropriate for life today. 

V. A New Conservative Platform
If we turn to the future, it's easy to see some of the tasks that strong-government conservatism will champion.
 The War on Islamic extremism. The first great agenda item has been thrust upon us. This has been miscast as a war on terror, but terror is just the means our enemies use. In reality, we're fighting a war against a specific brand of Islamic extremism, a loose federation of ideologues who seek to dominate the Middle East and return it to the days of the caliphate. 
 We are in the beginning of this war, where we were against Bolshevism around 1905 or Fascism in the early 1930's, with enemies that will continue to gain strength, thanks to the demographic bulge in the Middle East producing tens of millions of young men, politically and economically stagnant societies ensuring these young men have nothing positive to do and an indoctrination system designed to turn them into soldiers for the cause. This fight will organize our politics for a generation, as the Cold War did.
 The first task is to build a new set of strong federal and multinational institutions to defeat this foe. Obviously the intelligence community needs to be reorganized. The military needs to be bulked up, and public diplomacy needs to be rethought. Somebody has to develop a counterideological message that is more than just: ''We're Americans. We're really decent people. We're nice to Muslims.'' 
 We need to strengthen nation-states. The great menace of the 20th century was overbearing and tyrannical governments. The great menace of the 21st century will be failed governments, because those are the places where our enemies will be able to harbor and thrive, where violence can nurture and grow, where life is nasty, brutish and short. 
 We are going to have to construct a multilateral nation-building apparatus so that each time a nation-building moment comes along, we don't have to patch one together ad hoc. In the 1990's we thought free markets were the first things new nations needed to thrive and grow. Now we know that law and order is the first thing they need. We are going to have to construct new institutions to help nations develop rule of law within their boundaries, for if that is not accomplished, all the economic development in the world will not help. 
 Entitlement reform. At home, the most obvious and daunting problem is runaway entitlement spending. Right now, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security consume 8 percent of U.S. G.D.P. By 2040 these programs will consume 17 percent. In other words, these programs will swallow a sixth of the national wealth, requiring massive tax hikes to support them. That's simply unsupportable if we are to maintain a vibrant, growing economy. 
 Just as bad, entitlements will devour the federal budget. It will become impossible to create new programs to deal with new problems. The government will become a giant, immobile entitlement machine. The U.S. will follow Europe down the route of welfare-state stagnation, with growing burdens, aging populations, limited growth and horrendous choices. 
 The solution is clear: push back the retirement age, reduce benefits for upper-income people, redesign the welfare state so that individuals have control over their own benefits packages. That means designing programs that allow people to have their own health insurance, which they can carry from job to job; to control their own unemployment insurance and tailor their retraining efforts to suit their own talents; to invest part of their own pension money and benefit from higher returns, so they have greater incentives to save on their own. It means reforming the health care system so competition works as it does in every other sphere -- to improve value, spur innovation and reduce costs. Our current welfare state produces either no competition or warped and ineffective competition. 
 Social mobility. America remains a remarkably mobile society, but at the bottom ends of the education and income scales, we're seeing an ever-larger group of people unable to rise and succeed. Over the past two decades there has been a sharp rise in the number of people who define themselves to pollsters as ''have-nots.'' Though poverty has declined since 1988, the number of blacks who call themselves ''have-nots'' has risen to 48 percent from 24 percent. The number of whites who use that phrase to describe themselves has risen to 28 percent from 17 percent. These perceptions have been rising steadily over the Bush, Clinton and Bush presidencies.
 When people call themselves ''have-nots,'' they are not only commenting on their current economic status. They are also commenting on their prospects. They are saying that they do not see any plausible way they are going to make it and thrive in this society. This is poisonous. It is doubly poisonous because African-Americans feel this way in such high numbers. In other words, not only is there a perceived lack of opportunity, but this perception also rubs raw at the central wound that runs through our entire history: racial inequality.
 Worst of all, this is not just perception. People without skills really do have limited prospects in the world. There really is a huge achievement gap. By high-school graduation, the average Hispanic or African-American student is roughly four years behind the typical white or Asian student, and this gap has been getting worse over the past 15 years, despite $100 billion in Title I money spent to reduce it. The results are obvious and horrific. According to one study, 44 percent of urban African-American men without a high-school degree are idle all year round. Lacking jobs, they lack prospects. This is an affront to our identity as the land of opportunity, a menace to the Lincolnian vision of a hypermobile society and ruinous to our social fabric.
 Conservatives know that any solution begins with culture. Successful families raise successful people. They raise children who lead stimulated, rich and reinforced lives, who are not plopped in front of the TV, who are not starved of discipline and affection. They raise people instilled with bourgeois values -- industry, responsibility, loyalty and decency. They are more likely to understand that they are responsible for their own choices, not victims of social forces. Most of all, they are more likely to have the sort of soft skills -- the ability to control your emotions, to greet a new person and make a good impression, to have confidence in your ability to succeed -- that are absolutely essential in the marketplace.
 Progressive conservatives understand that while culture matters most, government can alter culture. It has done it in bad ways, and it can do it in good ways. Government agencies are now trying to design programs to encourage and strengthen marriage. Early- childhood intervention programs were not a conservative idea, but they work, and any decent party will embrace them.
 Wage subsidies, originally a Republican idea, would also strengthen families. The welfare reform movement has lifted people off welfare and into jobs, but it has not lifted them out of poverty in sufficient numbers. If we're to encourage work, then we must be sure that work is rewarded. The earned income tax credit does that. Other wage- subsidy ideas have been proposed, for example a simplified family credit that would replace the E.I.T.C., the child tax credit and other tax credits and exemptions to provide working families with one, simple benefit.
 Then there are the schools. For most of the 20th century, Republicans reacted with horror at the thought of a significant federal role in education. ''Local control'' was the mantra. That's over. More and more conservatives understand that local control means local monopolies and local mediocrity. Most Republicans, happily or not, have embraced a significant federal role in education -- to smash the education monopolies, enforce consequences for schools that don't meet achievement standards and free individual schools and principals to find the best ways to succeed. 
 We've had wave after wave of education reforms over the past two decades. Each one of them gets sucked into the bog of the system. We have given principals faux responsibility for their schools. We have laid down faux standards for achievements. We have given a few parents faux choice. It's time to shake up fundamentally the self-serving network of bureaucracies and unions. Charter schools, in which school leaders can actually control their own enterprises, can still make a difference, despite the problems many are having in getting started (and despite the premature attacks that have recently been leveled against them). There should be a federal Homestead Act for charters, providing them with start-up capital for new buildings and equipment. Vouchers can make a difference, especially in areas where schools are demonstrably failing. 
 Certification rules need to be revamped so a wider variety of Americans can teach. Compensation shouldn't be based primarily on seniority but on performance. Innovators should get bonuses, as in any other field. Principals should not be drawn exclusively from the ranks of teachers but also from the ranks of business, the military and other fields. The federal government needs to insist, through national tests like the current national assessment exams, that all American students graduate with a basic knowledge of American history and institutions, simply as a matter of good citizenship.
 Restore the integrity of our institutions. Not long ago, there was a clear distinction between conservatives and Republicans. Conservatives believed in principles; Republicans sold out. Conservatives admired capitalism but understood that businesspeople fundamentally did not like competition and would much rather use their lobbying power to induce government to protect them from competition, to confer unfair advantages, to offer them subsidies and to issue regulations that blocked future competitors.
 Over the past few years the distinction between conservative and Republican has eroded. Under Tom DeLay, the conservative movement has fused with the K Street brigades. There are now few ideological checks on the corporate community's desire to use government to stifle competition. Now it is conservatives who often embrace special tax breaks, special subsidies, special regulatory sinecures. This is a cancer on modern conservatism, and most every conservative in his or her heart knows it. 
 People in the strong-government tradition do not believe in active government for the sake of active government, but for the sake of competition. Some future president needs to go through the budget and rake out the tens of billions of dollars of corporate subsidies. They can be reduced only all at once, in a great sweep that overwhelms the parochial lobbying campaigns that groups will mount on behalf of each one. They can be reduced only as part of a larger tax-reform effort that will simplify the code, flatten rates and clean out the morass of credits, deductions, phaseouts, differential taxation arrangements, double-taxation provisions, alternative-minimum-tax fiascoes and growth-inhibiting distortions. 
 Everybody understands that our budget and tax systems have become dishonorable, favoring the well connected, neglecting everybody else, breeding cynicism and sapping national morale. These systems will never be pure and pork-free. But every few years somebody has to come in and clean out the encrustations that inevitably develop. 
 The energy revolution. Our current energy supplies are economically unsustainable and politically dangerous. For conservatives, the first task is to move the debate beyond its politically ruinous confines. Republicans currently stand for production, the cultivation of existing technologies and a sometimes callous disregard for the environment. Democrats stand for conservation, the cultivation of environmentally sensitive but unrealistic technologies and a sometimes callous disregard for economic growth.
 In halting and inconsistent ways, the Bush administration is trying to crash through all this. It vows to pursue ''transformational technologies.'' The administration has proposed spending $1.7 billion to develop hydrogen-powered fuel cells. Dozens of other ideas are floating around: reviving nuclear energy, fusion, new coal extraction techniques and so on. But these proposals are too modest, out of proportion to the problems that confront us. This is a perfect sphere for limited but energetic government, for a government that stimulates innovation but does not succumb to the lure of industrial policy making, of picking one technology over another and thus, for political reasons, shutting off avenues of innovation. 
 National service. American society is now rife with forces that encourage people to think about their own success, to cultivate their own gardens, to segment themselves off into their own cultural cliques. There should be at least one moment in life when people are encouraged to serve a cause larger than self-interest, fuse their own efforts with those from other regions and other walks of life and cultivate a spirit of citizenship.
 For the sake of character development and national union, national service should be a rite of passage for young Americans. Senators Evan Bayh and John McCain have proposed one plan. Young volunteers would go through a boot camp experience, taking them out of the rhythms of their lives, forcing them to endure a fiber-testing ordeal along with people unlike themselves. They could either join an expanded AmeriCorps or serve for 18 months in the military, helping out with noncombat duties.
 As William F. Buckley, Jr. once wrote: ''Materialistic democracy beckons every man to make himself a king; republican citizenship incites every man to be a knight. National service, like gravity, is something we could accustom ourselves to, and grow to love.''
By using government in limited but energetic ways, conservatives could establish credibility that would enable them to reduce the size of government where it is useless or worse -- export subsidies, agricultural subsidies and the like. Then they could use that credibility to reduce the increases in entitlement spending -- the giant set of programs that crowd out everything else. 
 More than that, conservatives have it in their power to refashion the political landscape. American politics is now polarized, evenly divided and stagnant. It has become like World War I. Each party is down in its trench, lobbing the same old arguments, relying on the same old coalitions. Neither party is able to gain a lasting advantage. Neither party is able to accomplish much that it is proud of.
 Trench warfare finally ended because somebody invented the tank. It is time for one party or another to invent the tank, some new governing philosophy that will broaden its coalition and transform the partisan divide. For Republicans, the progressive conservative governing philosophy is the tank. It is the approach to politics best suited to the emerging suburban civilization, best suited to life during a war on Islamic extremism. It is the way Republicans can build a governing majority and leave a positive mark on the nation and its destiny.

HEADLINE: 3 Moderates at Center Stage, Cautiously

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
THE host of the Republican National Convention, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, used to be a Democrat. He changed parties when he ran for office. And the governor of the host state, George E. Pataki, is a Republican who supports abortion rights, gay rights and gun control.
 In short, New York's two top Republicans do not appear to have much in common with the thrust of the national party, and that may be part of the point. 
 New York City was selected as host city for the first time largely because of the symbolism it evoked -- the attack on Sept. 11, 2001, the president standing on a pile of rubble rallying the nation. But New York and its historically liberal brand of Republicanism can also help blunt the perception of some of the sharper edges of the national Republican Party, political strategists say.
 And certainly Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg help in making that case during a convention that has been carefully scripted.
 New York is a bit of an enigma. Although it is overwhelmingly Democratic and solidly in the blue column this presidential season -- the last national Republican to carry the state was Ronald Reagan in 1984 -- it has elected Republicans as governor and, lately, as New York City's mayor.
 Now those officials -- Mr. Pataki, Mr. Bloomberg and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- are effectively hosts of the convention. For each, the stakes are high. It is no secret that Mr. Pataki, who will introduce the president at the convention on Thursday, and Mr. Giuliani, who will give a prime-time address on Monday, both harbor ambitions of running for president. The convention is a chance to make their case to the party faithful who might not otherwise be inclined to support a New Yorker in a primary. But they must be careful not to alienate their base of support -- at home in New York.
 For Mr. Bloomberg, there are many potential pitfalls, too. Still in his first term (he would be up for re-election in 2005), he has so far successfully bridged the divide between his party affiliation and that of most of his constituents. But the convention could test that success; Mr. Bloomberg, for example, will speak on the first day of the convention, but he is not a delegate. At the same time, if all goes smoothly, he can silence critics who have said that the convention will do little to help the city economically, and that protests could run out of control and actually hurt the city's reputation.
 And so each of these men approach the convention enthusiastically and cautiously. In that, they are not alone.
 ''There are some elements of the party that are very problematic for New York State Republicans,'' said Michael Balboni, a Republican state senator from Long Island who is talked about as a potential gubernatorial candidate should Mr. Pataki not seek a fourth term in 2006. ''I am the last person the national Republicans would ask to speak. I am in favor of increasing the minimum wage, gay rights and gun control.''
 Republicans complain that there are no obviously strong candidates to take up the party flag when Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg eventually leave office (unless Mr. Giuliani decides to run for governor).
 The state Senate is controlled by Republicans, but they have moved so far to the left on some issues that the Conservative Party has threatened to fight Senate Republicans. There is only one Republican member of Congress from New York City, Vito J. Fossella of Staten Island. 
 ''I predict that no New York State Republican candidate this year will run to take pictures with George Bush for use in their campaign materials,'' said Norman Adler, a political consultant and lobbyist who works with eight Republican state senators. 
 Still, Mr. Pataki will be in the picture with Mr. Bush. The governor's brand of Republicanism, so moderate that some critics have said he often acts more like a Democrat than a Republican, certainly a Republican from Texas, may be the counterbalance that Mr. Bush's advisers are looking for, political consultants say. And that may well work for Mr. Pataki's national ambitions.
 ''The convention gives him an opportunity to demonstrate to Republicans across the country just how much we all have in common,'' said Michael McKeon, a political consultant and former press secretary to Mr. Pataki. ''Republicans from the South and other conservative places at first, and even second, glance may not think of a New Yorker as someone they share common beliefs with. But this will demonstrate that they do.''

HEADLINE: Transcending Politics, A Whale Necktie

BYLINE: BY JENNIFER 8. LEE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
DEMOCRATS and Republicans may clash over who did what when they put on military uniforms. They may disagree about where on their shirts to wear religion. But they are all but united in their taste in neckties.
 The bright, whimsically patterned ties made by Vineyard Vines, featuring whales, sailboats, golf clubs and other emblems of the good life, preppy division, have become a visible statement in Washington's political class. 
 ''If I see someone in Washington wearing a Vineyard Vines tie, I think they are in politics -- a politician, a lobbyist or an intern,'' said Jim McKenry, who owns a tie distribution company. ''It's a good look for a lot less money, and it tells a story.'' 
 High-profile wearers include John Kerry, the first President Bush, Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. They are also widely spotted on staff members of both campaigns, in K Street lobbying shops and in the White House. The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, recently sent a note to the company, thanking it for a gift tie. ''I'll wear it with pride at the upcoming convention,'' he wrote.
 In Washington, where the corridors are awash in a sea of blue and gray suits, and neckwear varies between stripes and solids, the playful patterns of Vineyard Vines ties, which resemble those found on boxer shorts, pass for daring fashion. 
 ''They are breezy but bold, cool but confident, sporty but spunky,'' said Jonathan Grella, the spokesman for Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority leader. Mr. Grella owns about 20 of the ties. 
 Yet when the Republicans go to New York this week, they may find local fashion mavens arching their eyebrows over this stab at bold fashion. ''It's perfect for Washington because it's not a city where guys are going to get ahead by being really stylish -- it's about conforming,'' said Wendell Brown, the senior fashion editor for Esquire. ''A tie is so much more noncommittal than a radical suit or a pants cut or something like that.''
 Michael Hainey, the deputy editor of GQ, added, ''They're a limp way for a guy who has to wear a boring suit to add some 'personality.' ''
 In other words, the ties are for those men who like to stay within the box but do not like to acknowledge there is one. This personality profile seems common in Washington, judging by the number of men who have a dozen-plus Vineyard Vines ties in their closets, many of them gifts from Washington women.
 This narrow zone for expressing individuality suits many Washingtonians just fine. ''This is a brand that has clearly bridged a gap: the economic value that Democrats like and the elegance that Republicans like,'' said Tripp Donnelly, a Democrat who is president of the Capitol Club, a bipartisan Washington fraternity of sorts, minus the Greek letters, which has ordered custom-made Vineyard Vines ties showing the club's logo: the Capitol dome flipped over as a wine glass. 
 Vineyard Vines's most prominent patron is Mr. Kerry, who once favored French Hermes ties, but started appearing almost exclusively in Vineyard Vines neckwear last year after the European provenances of his ties came under scrutiny by journalists. (At $64 each, Vineyard Vines ties are also less elitist than the $120-plus numbers from Ferragamo and Hermes, some argue.) Mr. Kerry's Vines collection includes ties with lacrosse sticks, parrots and palms, hot-air balloons and seashells. He even helped design a custom Vineyard Vines campaign tie with JK04 logos, which are passed out sparingly.
 ''They're nice ties,'' Mr. Kerry said in a recent interview on his choice of neckwear. ''I don't go shopping a lot. They're easy to get, on the Internet.''
 Mr. Kerry points out to reporters that his ties are made in America, and in a year when outsourcing has become a controversial issue, the homegrown, entrepreneurial story of the company has a great deal of appeal. Based in Greenwich, Conn., Vineyard Vines was started with $8,000 in credit-card debt by two brothers, Ian and Shep Murray, who gave up their jobs as investment bankers six years ago. The ties gained popularity with politicians in part because so many vacation in Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, where they were originally sold. 
 ''Our ties are representative of the good life, and a lot of people associated time on the beach or time on the water with the good life,'' Ian Murray said. 
 Some Republicans temporarily abandoned Vineyard Vines after the ties became associated with Mr. Kerry last spring. But eventually the ties came back out of the closet. The Republican Party is unveiling its own custom Vineyard Vines ties for contributors and supporters at the convention. Christine Iverson, the spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said, ''In the heat of a hard-fought election year, it's nice to know that there are some things that are bipartisan.''

HEADLINE: It's Not New Jobs. It's All The Jobs.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
NOW that the work force is growing again, President Bush and Senator John Kerry have been arguing about the quality of the newly created jobs -- whether a majority are toward the higher or lower end of the wage scale. That is the wrong debate. The real issue is not how well the new jobs pay, but whether the incomes of workers in general are rising or falling. On the second score, there is not much to debate. The incomes of most workers, adjusted for inflation, are sinking.
 The evidence for this assertion is piling up. The Census Bureau weighed in last week with the latest update on family and household incomes. Both declined through the first three years of the Bush administration. From the Bureau of Labor Statistics comes a similar story for individual workers. Whether the measure is median weekly pay or average weekly pay, the increases have been too small since last summer to keep up with a measly climb of 1 percentage point in the inflation rate. 
 ''That is true across nearly all full-time wage earners,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com. Lower-end workers have taken the biggest hit, but people at the higher end -- earning as much as $75,000 a year -- are hurt, too. ''The job market is still very weak,'' Mr. Zandi said, ''and employers have the upper hand in negotiations.''
 Against this backdrop, the two presidential camps have spent an inordinate amount of time on a minor point, the quality of the 1.5 million jobs that have been created since last August. That is a minuscule slice of the 131.3 million jobs in the overall work force, and we know less about the new jobs than we do about the work force as a whole, which is clearly losing ground.
 Government data do tell us that a majority of the new jobs are in industries and occupations at the lower end of the wage scale -- restaurant workers, for example. What we do not know from this data is the pay for specific jobs. A cook at a fancy restaurant earns much more than one at a diner. Yet both are put in the same classification by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Mr. Kerry argues that a majority of the new jobs are low-paying ''bad jobs.'' But that overstates the case. The data suggest that he is probably right, but not with the certainty he asserts. The Bush camp, on the other hand, argues that the quality of the new jobs is unknowable. Or as N.Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote recently, ''Different analysts using these imperfect data can reach wildly different conclusions.'' But that dismisses too easily the evidence that a majority of the new jobs are in industries and occupations that generate low-wage work.
 Income, meanwhile, sinks for the work force as a whole. Much more definitive numbers, ignored so far by both candidates, make that point vividly. This set of numbers deals with laid-off workers. There were 9.86 million wage earners who lost full-time jobs from 2001 through 2003, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last month, releasing the latest results of a survey conducted every two years. 
 That dwarfs the recent job creation, and the survey captures only people who acknowledge having been laid off. It misses the disguised layoffs, like forced early retirements, which are proliferating. 
 Forty-five percent of the 9.86 million were back in another full-time job by the time of the survey, or 4.4 million people. Of those, 52 percent earned less than they had at their last jobs. The 1994 and 1984 surveys covered similar periods of recession and recovery, yet the percentages of the re-employed earning less in their new jobs were lower -- 47 percent in 1994 and 42 percent in 1984. 
 LOSING ground is a disheartening experience. On a broader plane, it contributes to the wage stagnation and income inequality that have characterized the last 30 years. Both are reappearing after a hiatus that started in the mid-1990's and lasted more or less until 2002. 
 Yet Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry fail to spotlight this alarming downward trend, from which they could segue into a debate over how to ameliorate the income deterioration. A higher minimum wage would probably help. So would an expanded government role in providing health insurance, relieving employers of some of the rising cost. Perhaps some or all of the money saved would go to wage increases.
 Mr. Kerry embraces these positions much more than Mr. Bush, who prefers to let the marketplace solve wage and employment problems, allowing a minimum of government intervention, except tax cuts. These are huge differences, yet the candidates become sidetracked in debates over the quality of 1.5 million newly created jobs and fail to pound away at each other in the main event -- how to arrest declining income in the vastly larger work force.

HEADLINE: Behind VW's Wheel, With Brick Walls Ahead

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
THE most famous thing that Bernd Pischetsrieder has ever done with a car, he readily acknowledges, is to crash it. In 1995, Mr. Pischetsrieder, then the chairman of BMW, took his company's McLaren F1 -- an exotic $1 million sports car -- home for the weekend. Driving on a serpentine road in the Bavarian countryside with two passengers, he lost control of the car, which rolled over several times and came to rest in a field. His companions had only minor injuries, but the McLaren was wrecked.
 Mr. Pischetsrieder would never condone reckless driving, of course, but he is all for taking chances on the job. ''If you don't take risks in our business, you better resign immediately,'' said Mr. Pischetsrieder, 56, who is now taking the risk of his career as the chairman of Germany's largest carmaker, Volkswagen.
 To say Volkswagen is heading for a crash only modestly exaggerates the gravity of its problems: plummeting profits; eroding market share in the United States; new headwinds in China, its fastest-growing market; and the troubled introduction of the latest Golf, its linchpin model. All of those have conspired to make Mr. Pischetsrieder's first two years at the company a bone-jarring ride. 
 Next month, he will face off against Volkswagen's powerful union in what people here predict will be an epic confrontation. The company wants to freeze the wages of 103,000 workers and make its factories more efficient by loosening its notoriously rigid work rules. The union, demanding job security and a 4 percent pay raise, is girding for war.
 ''Whether there will be a battle or not, I don't know,'' Mr. Pischetsrieder said in a recent interview. ''One thing is for sure. If we want to have 30 percent lower wage costs in six years, we have to start now.''
 A courtly man whose goatee and trademark Cuban cigar lend him an old-world panache, he seems an improbable choice to guide Volkswagen through these nasty times. Some people wonder whether his tenure is destined to end the way his last job did: he was ousted from BMW in 1999, after making a ruinous acquisition of the British carmaker Rover. 
 ''People in the industry are starting to ask whether there is a Pischetsrieder curse,'' said Graeme Maxton, an analyst at Autopolis, an industry consulting firm in London. Under his predecessor, Mr. Maxton noted, Volkswagen rode a booming global economy to rich profits. Then, after Mr. Pischetsrieder took over from Ferdinand K. Piech in April 2002, ''the bottom fell out of the car market, China slowed down and the new models didn't work.''
 ''My belief is that he was handed something of a poisoned chalice,'' Mr. Maxton added.
 Mr. Pischetsrieder is diplomatic about Mr. Piech, a brilliant, driven engineer who is credited with pulling the carmaker out of its last major crisis in the 1990's. He remains enormously influential as the chairman of the company's supervisory board.
 Still, Mr. Pischetsrieder has begun to distance himself from his predecessor's autocratic style and some of his decisions -- particularly a costly campaign to vault Volkswagen into the luxury market with the $75,000 Phaeton. ''If you want to establish a brand in a high-price segment, the last thing you would do is to do it with a saloon,'' he said, using the British word for a sedan. Owners of luxury sedans like those from Mercedes or BMW, he said, are unlikely to trade for one from the maker of the Beetle.
 Mr. Pischetsrieder delivers this critique with a twinkle in his eye and the hint of a British accent -- a legacy, former associates say, of his days as BMW's representative in South Africa. In an industry not known for its savoir-faire, he has earned the reputation of being a man of culture.
 ROBERT A. LUTZ, the vice chairman of General Motors, who once negotiated a joint venture with Mr. Pischetsrieder to produce engines, said his balanced personality has been a stabilizing force for VW, which is based in Wolfsburg, Germany. ''You need to be a car guy to create great, compelling cars,'' Mr. Lutz said. ''But you also need the financial acumen of a responsible executive to know when it's time to stop. He has that balance.''
 So far, Mr. Pischetsrieder has been busy just coping with the extravagant legacy of Mr. Piech, at a time when extravagance has gone out of fashion. In March, he announced a plan to double Volkswagen's cost-cutting target to 4 billion euros ($4.84 billion) by 2005, which would involve cutting 5,000 jobs. He dismissed the head of sales and marketing, Robert Buchelhofer, in an attempt to stem eroding sales.
 A mechanical engineer who prides himself on seeing the parking lot as well as the cars, Mr. Pischetsrieder has delegated decision-making in a company that used to be run almost like the boss's personal fief. He does not blame Mr. Piech for his command-and-control style, he said, because Volkswagen needed drastic action when he took over. ''You cannot care about product life cycles when you dearly need a new Golf and a new Passat simultaneously,'' he said. (Mr. Piech declined a request for an interview.) 
 To be sure, Volkswagen's problems result from more than its own missteps. The auto market has slumped worldwide in the last few years, nowhere more than in Volkswagen's home country. Car sales in Germany fell 7 percent in July, versus the same month last year. Registrations of cars made by Volkswagen, which include Audi and Seat, fell 14 percent.
 Volkswagen has been hobbled further by the rise of the euro against the dollar, which has hurt its sales in the United States and other markets pegged to the dollar. The company aggravated its trouble by not hedging its currency exposure until after other German carmakers did.
 In China, where Volkswagen has long been the dominant foreign player, its franchise is coming under attack, as General Motors, DaimlerChrysler and other rivals ramp up production. In June, G.M. for the first time sold more cars in China than Volkswagen did, forcing VW to cut its prices. ''Volkswagen in China is like Ford Motor was in the United States in the 1920's,'' said Garel Rhys, director of the automotive industry research group at Cardiff University in Wales. ''In 1920, Ford had 65 percent of the U.S. market. By 1929, G.M. had passed them by.''
 Historical parallels like that would give most auto executives heartburn. But if Mr. Pischetsrieder is feeling the burden of all these troubles, he isn't showing it. Puffing serenely on his aged Partagas, he said Volkswagen had bottomed out in the first quarter this year.
 In July, the company cut its projected operating profit for 2004 to 1.9 billion euros, before extraordinary charges, from an earlier forecast of 2.5 billion euros. Mr. Pischetsrieder said that Volkswagen might beat the reduced target, but that he expected little improvement this year or early next year.
 Volkswagen's problems are most apparent in the disappointing introduction of its new Golf. Responding to criticism that the latest version of this old favorite was too pricey, Volkswagen has thrown in free air-conditioning. It sold 278,000 of the cars in the first half of the year, making the Golf again Europe's best-selling model -- a title it lost briefly to the Peugeot 206.
 Having tamped down expectations, Mr. Pischetsrieder can turn to the business of retooling Volkswagen, a far-flung empire with 336,000 employees, 45 assembly plants in 18 countries and $104 billion in annual sales. In addition to VW and Audi, its brands range from the proletarian Skoda to the rarefied Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti, the latest model of which costs $1 million and has a 1,001-horsepower engine.
 Expanding Volkswagen into every niche had been one of Mr. Piech's dreams. A descendant of the Porsche sports-car family, he focused obsessively on creating cars. That revived Volkswagen in the 1990's, when it had gotten a rap for dreary products and dubious workmanship.
 But Mr. Piech's fleet of cars eventually created problems. Volkswagen, analysts say, now has too many models in the same price range. His strategy of sharing platforms and components from Volkswagen with its sisters, Seat and Skoda, blurred the image of the individual brands. Mr. Piech's product drive also came at the expense of sales and marketing. In the United States, Volkswagen has been hit with accusations of poor quality and erratic service on the part of its dealers. ''We have some excellent dealers; we have some lousy dealers,'' Mr. Pischetsrieder said.
 Most of all, Volkswagen's attempt to burnish its brand name -- it means ''people's car'' in German -- has been too expensive. To showcase the Phaeton, it built a $180 million assembly plant in Dresden, with shimmering glass walls, Canadian maple floors and a circular central foyer.
 SALES of the Phaeton have been dismal on both sides of the Atlantic. To reduce the head-to-head competition with luxury sedans from Mercedes and BMW, Volkswagen may overhauling the car to make it more of a cross between a station wagon and a coupe. The Phaeton may be flawed, Mr. Pischetsrieder said, but the strategy is still sound. Volkswagen's upscale sport utility vehicle, the Touareg, has been a success. ''The point is whether you can get an expensive car with a Volkswagen logo into the garage of a wealthy man or woman,'' he said. ''The worst thing that can happen is that we get the product wrong.''
 At BMW, Mr. Pischetsrieder faced the opposite challenge. To expand into the mass market, he bought the struggling Rover, which made the Land Rover, the MG sports car and the fabled Mini, for $1.2 billion.
 Mr. Pischetsrieder even had a personal tie to the Mini. His Greek-born granduncle, Sir Alec Issigonis, had designed the car. That did not save his investment, however. Rover continued to bleed money, becoming known as ''the English Patient.'' In February 1999, Mr. Pischetsrieder lost his job. In a bittersweet coda, BMW held on to the Mini, reintroducing the car and turning it into a hip, retro brand.
 People who know Mr. Pischetsrieder say the Rover experience shows both strength and weakness. He has great instincts about cars, they say, but his methodical style can let problems fester. ''He is a very relaxed guy,'' said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen. ''But he takes things step by step, which can be time-consuming.''
 It was Mr. Pischetsrieder's credentials as a ''car guy'' that drew him to Mr. Piech. The two had become acquainted while traveling with the former chancellor, Helmut Kohl. Alphabetical seating on the plane meant they found themselves next to each other.
 Mr. Pischetsrieder's latest moves, however, have little to do with new models. In April, he announced a 2 billion euro deal in which Volkswagen will join investors from the Persian Gulf region to buy a Dutch fleet management company, LeasePlan. The acquisition, he said, would give Volkswagen another channel to customers. That is important, he said, in a time of diminishing brand loyalty and powerful nationwide auto dealers.
 Yet the deal's most intriguing implications lie elsewhere: Volkswagen hopes to finance the purchase by selling shares to an investment fund linked to the government of Abu Dhabi, one of the seven states in the United Arab Emirates. That could make it the company's second- or third-largest shareholder, after the state of Lower Saxony and Brandes Investment Partners, an asset-management firm based in San Diego.
 Mr. Pischetsrieder, still negotiating the stock price, said he would welcome Abu Dhabi as a stable investor. He prefers ''long-term investors to hedge funds,'' he said, adding that someday, Volkswagen might even move truck production to the gulf region.
 Analysts said the emergence of Abu Dhabi as a major shareholder would give the management of Volkswagen more independence from Lower Saxony. The state owns 18.2 percent of the company's shares, giving it the power to block a takeover and other major decisions.
 Lower Saxony's influence is likely to be felt most in the labor negotiations. Though many officials privately applaud Volkswagen's efforts to extract a more flexible contract from the unions, they would cringe at the prospect of Volkswagen shutting down a major plant in Germany.
 Mr. Pischetsrieder said he did not plan to issue sweeping threats to move production to Central Europe. Volkswagen already produces the Touareg at a giant plant in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, and its Audi roadster at a plant in Hungary. Persuading the rank-and-file to accept a two-year wage freeze may be more difficult. The chief negotiator for the IG Metall union, Hartmut Meine, dismissed Volkswagen's stance as exaggerated and unrealistic. ''I am a strong negotiating partner,'' Mr. Meine said. ''If there is no compromise, I am certainly in a position to call a strike.''
 Such rancor is almost unheard of at BMW, a smaller company with generally harmonious labor relations. Some outsiders wonder whether Mr. Pischetsrieder, having spent 26 years in those cozy confines, was temperamentally suited to make the leap to a big, messy company like Volkswagen.
 The way he sees it, though, he can bring the best of BMW to Volkswagen. He knows he is part of an elite fraternity -- executives who have had the chance to run not one but two major auto companies. ''I didn't find anything here that I didn't know about,'' Mr. Pischetsrieder said, stubbing out his cigar as he headed back to Wolfsburg. ''If there is anyone to blame, it would be myself.''

HEADLINE: Warming Up For New York, Bush Sounds Moderate Note

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: PERRYSBURG, Ohio, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
As he sweeps across the country practicing his lines for his convention speech in New York on Thursday night, President Bush is subtly shifting his campaign pitch toward the middle ground: stripping his speeches of strong ideology, emphasizing economic pragmatism, even admitting to making what he casts as modest errors in judgment in the Iraq war.
 In a jammed high school gymnasium in Lima on Saturday, Mr. Bush used an hour-and-a-half exchange with supporters to offer what he hinted were glimpses of his acceptance speech.
 His wife, Laura, was not with him, he told several thousand supporters because ''she's working on her convention speech.'' Then, to laughter, he added, ''I better get working on mine.'' 
 In fact, aides say that between his visits to swing states, New Mexico on Thursday, Florida on Friday and his bus tour up the western spine of Ohio on Saturday, Mr. Bush has begun practicing the speech and ordering revisions. And, as they often do before major milestones in his presidency, they are already trying to diminish expectations. 
 ''It's not the most important speech of his life,'' Andrew H. Card, the White House chief of staff, said Saturday as Mr. Bush spoke at a rally in Troy, in a conservative corner of the state that four years ago gave Mr. Bush the boost he needed to take Ohio.
 Mr. Card said the speech was a chance ''to build on the momentum we already have been building.'' 
 But clearly Mr. Bush's aides are worried that the economic downturn here could tip the state to Senator John Kerry, the Democratic candidate. A group of teenagers south of this town, where Mr. Bush spoke inside a wooden fort dating to the early days of Ohio's settlement, flashed signs at Mr. Bush's bus that read: ''My Dad Needs Work.'' So Mr. Bush used his appearances here to acknowledge economic distress, saying, ''I fully understand there are places here in Ohio where people are still looking for work.'' 
 Still, the unwelcome reports on the growth of poverty and downward revisions of economic growth earlier this year have fueled a movement among Mr. Bush's advisers to offer some new economic proposals in the acceptance speech. 
 One senior aide said that after Mr. Kerry's acceptance speech, ''we all decided it was about who he was in Vietnam, rather than who he is now,'' and added ''that gives the president a chance to give a very different kind of speech, one that describes a specific second-term agenda.''
 At times, Mr. Bush seemed to be practicing lines for Thursday night. ''I may just tell this story next week,'' he told the crowd in Lima, before spinning into a familiar story from his stump speech about how seven Iraqi men visited him in the Oval Office one day, each of whom had one hand chopped off by agents of Saddam Hussein.
 But apart from his descriptions of the former Iraqi leader or the Taliban, Mr. Bush used every opportunity to avoid sounding strident. When one questioner invited him to attack Mr. Kerry's military record, the president demurred, saying the issue was not where either candidate served, but which one was better qualified today to be commander in chief. And he sidestepped opportunities to talk about his opposition to abortion and gay marriage, divisive issues in swing states like this one.
 At every stop, Mr. Bush now volunteers the fact that Mr. Hussein apparently had no unconventional weapons but he makes no apologies for going into Iraq. 
 ''Even though we didn't find the stockpiles we expected to find, Saddam Hussein had the capability of making weapons of mass destruction, and he could of passed that capability on to the enemy,'' Mr. Bush said Saturday. 
 Yet Mr. Bush has not repeated in public the acknowledgment he made in an interview with The New York Times on last Thursday that he made ''a miscalculation of what conditions would be like after a swift victory in Iraq,'' and had not anticipated a 17-month-long insurgency. The line is drawing criticism of the president from the Kerry campaign. 
 On Thursday, his aides say, he will argue that whatever mistakes were made, they pale in comparison to the benefits of being rid of Mr. Hussein.

HEADLINE: The Mighty Power Of the Baby Boomers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 On Friday, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that programs like Social Security and Medicare might have to be scaled back when it is time for baby boomers to retire. 
 Mr. Greenspan said, ''As a nation, we owe it to our retirees to promise only the benefits that can be delivered.'' He seems to be telling baby boomers: Don't expect too much in retirement. That should be a catalyst for action. 
 Issues like the trashing of a healthy budget surplus and an unwarranted, ultraexpensive Iraq war aside, our leaders should be reminded who fueled all that economic growth in the past five decades with their hard work, productivity and investment.
 To suggest that baby boomers will just have to accept seeing their Social Security benefits further eroded because a robust economy has been squandered ignores the power in our ranks. 
 It may be time to remind our representatives that those who took to the streets over issues like Vietnam can do the same over being robbed of well-earned retirement benefits. We can also use our economic and investment clout in ways that will rattle the national economy as well. We have the numbers.

HEADLINE: Susan Lindauer's Mission To Baghdad

BYLINE: By David Samuels. 
David Samuels is a contributing editor at Harper's.

 BODY:
On the morning of March 11, 2004, Susan Lindauer woke to find five F.B.I. agents at her front door. After reading her her rights, the agents took Lindauer from her home in Takoma Park, Md., to the F.B.I. field office in Baltimore, where she was charged with having acted as an unregistered agent of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi government and otherwise having elevated the interests of a foreign country above her allegiance to the United States. ''The only visible sign of stress is that I'm chain-smoking,'' she said when I met with her recently. Forty-one and free on bail, she wore a red cotton shirt, shapeless khaki pants and battered white leather sneakers. With her casual manner, she could pass for an ordinary resident of Takoma Park, where ''War Is Not the Answer'' signs are available free at the local co-op. 
 Seated on the shady porch of her tumbledown cottage, overlooking a purple azalea bush, Lindauer was alternately pensive and bubbly as she talked about her encounter with the F.B.I. On her knees, she balanced a photo album, which contained photographs of her wild years in Alaska, where she grew up, and her time as an undergraduate at Smith College, where she majored in economics. She showed me pictures of her mother, Jackie, who died of cancer after Susan graduated from college, and her father, John, an academic economist who once ran on the Republican ticket for governor of Alaska. The youthful beauty of Susan's features in her early photographs has been transfigured over time into a middle-aged balance of beatitude and stubbornness. When she gets angry, a storm cloud passes over her face. When the storm cloud breaks, her expression becomes even and calm, like that of a child who has freshly emerged from a bath.
 Having grown up in a household in which public policy was frequently the stuff of dinner-table conversation and impassioned family arguments, Lindauer wanted to help change the world. The way she chose to do so, however, was not by signing petitions or marching in demonstrations, but by engaging in the kinds of clandestine encounters that you read about in spy novels -- meeting foreign diplomats, passing along secret messages and engaging in other activities that would eventually lead to her arrest. ''I'm what they call a useful idiot,'' she said with a laugh. According to the federal charges filed against her by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Lindauer repeatedly violated U.S. law beginning in 1999 by meeting with Iraqi diplomats at the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations in New York and with agents of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi Intelligence Service (I.I.S.). She was also indicted for accepting money from the Iraqis and traveling to Baghdad, where she met with Iraqi intelligence agents, in violation of federal law. ''From on or about Feb. 23, 2002, through on or about March 7, 2002,'' the indictment charged, ''Susan Lindauer, aka 'Symbol Susan,' met with several I.I.S. officers in Iraq, including at the Al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad, and received cash payments of approximately $5,000.00.'' The press was quick to identify Lindauer as an Iraqi spy. 
 ''I'm an antiwar activist, and I'm innocent,'' Lindauer told WBAL-TV as she was led to a car outside the F.B.I. field office in Baltimore. ''I did more to stop terrorism in this country than anybody else.'' In a moment of crisis, it seemed, having just been fingerprinted and charged with betraying her country, Lindauer was acting the way a person might act in a dream, blurting out the constituent parts of her fractured reality into a waiting microphone. 
The substance of the government's case against Susan Lindauer is contained in the indictment. Both the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on the case, and no date has been set for the trial. While Lindauer was not accused of espionage, as initial reports of her arrest suggested, the government did charge her with a serious crime, even if the charge itself may seem like a technicality. By failing to register herself formally as a lobbyist and by supposedly following instructions from Iraqi diplomats and intelligence agents at the United Nations, the government charged, Lindauer had been acting as ''an unregistered agent of a foreign government,'' a violation of federal law that is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Lindauer acknowledges that the meetings detailed in the federal indictment took place, but denies acting as an agent of Iraq or any other country. 
 On paper, at least, there is little to distinguish Lindauer from hundreds of other bright young people who come to Washington in the hope of making a difference. She graduated from Smith in 1985 and then went to the London School of Economics, where she earned a master's degree and developed an interest in the Arab world. In 1990, she went to Washington, where she briefly worked as a journalist and then as a press secretary for liberal Democrats in the House and Senate, including Ron Wyden and Carol Moseley Braun. None of her jobs lasted more than a year. Her most recent job on Capitol Hill, as a press secretary for Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, ended in May 2002. 
 Writing press releases often seemed less important to Lindauer than her own one-woman campaign to advance the cause of nonviolence in the Muslim world. Lindauer's highly individual brand of politics combined passions that were commonly identified with opposite poles of the political spectrum during the 90's. While she opposed sanctions on Libya and Iraq, she was also eager to awaken the West to the gathering threat posed by Middle Eastern terrorist organizations. In pursuit of her ideals, she says, she began traveling to New York as often as twice a week, meeting with diplomats from Muslim countries, including Yemen and Malaysia, as well as representatives of Libya and Iraq. Her aim, as she explained it, was to function as a handholder and cheerleader, an unofficial go-between who could help break the cycle of isolation, paranoia and suffering created by sanctions. 
 ''U.S. intelligence knew what I was doing,'' she said when I asked her about the precise nature of her contacts with the Libyans and the Iraqis. ''You see, the thing is, it's very hard to have these relationships, and so, when you have them, there are people who are very interested in the fact that you have them, who also want something from them, too.''
 To demonstrate her commitment to nonviolence, Lindauer also shared with me portions of the evidentiary material contained on a stack of compact disks turned over to her by the government. The evidence against her, which includes wiretapped conversations with friends, neighbors, foreign diplomats and fellow activists, is currently in the hands of her new court-appointed attorney, who was not representing Lindauer at the time I spoke to her. Among the documents Lindauer showed me was a transcript of a telephone conversation with Muthanna al-Hanooti, the president of Focus on American and Arab Interests and Relations, a nonprofit organization in Southfield, Mich., dated July 30, 2003, two days before the Arab-American activist made one of his frequent trips to Iraq. During the call, Lindauer praised al-Hanooti for being a ''man who believes in peace'' and exhorted him to ''stay with God -- just stay with God.'' As the conversation continued, al-Hanooti seemed to hover between impatience and boredom. ''Other people are doing bad things, and they may try to use you as cover for bad things,'' Lindauer said. ''So don't let them.'' 
 ''It's a very delicate balance, as you know,'' al-Hanooti replied. ''But, ah, we'll do our best, you know. We'll do our best.''
 That transcript, and others she gave me, support Lindauer's contention that she is opposed to violence. There were also other conversations the F.B.I. recorded that seem to suggest that Lindauer had other motivations for pursuing the work she did. ''He does not know about my visions -- he will never know about my visions, O.K.?'' she said, speaking to an undercover F.B.I. agent about another acquaintance. ''You're probably the only person you're going to meet other than my closest friend at the Iraqi Embassy who knows these things, O.K.? So don't ever talk about it with anyone.''
Susan Lindauer said she started making visits to the Libyan Mission to the United Nations in 1995 and started meeting with Iraqis at the United Nations in 1996. The F.B.I. first began tapping Lindauer's phone and intercepting her e-mail in July 2002, she said. A year and a half earlier, Lindauer contacted Andrew Card, the White House chief of staff, with letters containing what purported to be secret diplomatic communiques from the government of Iraq to the incoming Bush administration. Lindauer reached out to Card, she explained, because he is a distant cousin on her father's side of the family. She said she believed that the fate of the world depended on the sensitive communications she dropped on the doorstep of his house in suburban Virginia.
 One of Lindauer's earliest notes was left at Card's home on Dec. 23, 2000, a decade after sanctions were imposed on Iraq and a month before George W. Bush took office. Along with some of the transcripts of her wiretapped conversations, Lindauer gave me this letter to support her contention that she was working as a ''back channel'' between the governments of Iraq and the United States. The letter was addressed to Vice President-elect Cheney, and in it Lindauer presented the fruits of what she described as a private Nov. 26, 2000, meeting with Saeed Hasan, then the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations.
 ''Ambassador Hasan has asked me to communicate to you that Iraq most vigorously wishes to restore healthy, peaceful relations with the United States, including economic and cultural ties,'' Lindauer wrote. ''At our meeting, Ambassador Hasan demonstrated a pragmatic understanding that the United States requires the reinstatement of weapons monitoring in order to lift the sanctions.'' Ambassador Hasan, she said, had ''also emphasized that Iraq is ready to guarantee critical advantages for U.S. corporations at all levels.'' 
 It is possible that Lindauer's account is delusional. It is also possible that Lindauer's account is accurate. Iraq certainly tried to use other back channels to try to reach U.S. officials, including a Lebanese-American businessman, Imad Hage, who conveyed messages to Richard Perle in the run-up to the war. For her part, Lindauer says that she was unaware that her activities required her to register as a lobbyist -- a formality that, to her mind, seemed quite absurd. ''Everything that I did that was quote 'lobbying,''' she said, ''I was giving to the chief of staff of the White House.'' 
The winding path that led Lindauer to the door of the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations began in November 1993 at a diner in Virginia, where she met a friend of her father's, a woman who worked as the chief of staff for a Republican member of Congress. Worried that Lindauer was lonely, her father's friend brought another lonely guest, Paul Hoven, a gentle Army veteran who had piloted attack helicopters in combat in Vietnam. He was interested in spies and spying.
 '''You guys say you're peace activists,''' Lindauer recalled Hoven telling her that night. '''You say you're liberal do-gooders. What exactly are you doing? You do nothing. You're not active. You're passive.' And that conversation was probably one of the most important dinner conversations of my life.''
 It was Hoven who gave Lindauer the nickname Snowflake, which was quick to catch on among an informal circle of Capitol Hill staff members and intelligence-community enthusiasts who gathered every Thursday night at a Hunan restaurant across the street from the Heritage Foundation. ''I'm the one who named her Snowflake, because she's from Alaska and she's nuts,'' Hoven told me. In addition to feeling sorry for Lindauer, he was taken with her unusual mind. ''She seems to have the ability to take unrelated facts and string them together, to the point where you're left with, Gee, it probably happened that way.'' For her part, Lindauer says that she enjoyed leading a double life, working for liberals during the day and hanging out with conservatives interested in counterterrorism at night. 
 Not long after their first dinner, Hoven introduced Lindauer to his friend Dr. Richard Fuisz, a globe-trotting Virginia-based businessman whom Lindauer described to me as ''my contact in the C.I.A.''
 Lindauer's first meeting with Fuisz plunged her into a thicket of conflicting theories about the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The government blamed Libya for the bombing, and Libya later agreed to pay $2.7 billion to the families of the victims. There were others in the Washington intelligence community who said they believed that the real culprit was the terrorist Ahmed Jabril, who was based in Syria. Lindauer says that Fuisz told her at that first meeting that he knew who was responsible for the bombing. ''Dr. Fuisz has said that he can confirm absolutely that no Libyan national was involved in planning or executing the bombing of Pan Am 103,'' she later wrote in an account of their initial meeting. ''If the government would let me,'' she quoted Fuisz as saying, ''I could identify the men behind this attack today. I was investigating on the ground, and I know.'' 
 Several months after she first met with Fuisz, Lindauer met with Libyan diplomats in New York in order to share with them the story she claims she got from Fuisz. She says she hoped her story would clear Libya of responsibility for the attack. 
 Lindauer's decision to drive to New York and visit the Libyans, she says, was also motivated in part by her deep personal faith in God, ''the all-powerful, all-encompassing spirit'' that she had known since she was a child. After adolescent years of drug use and casual sex, she says, she found God again during the weekends she spent at the Victory Bible Camp in Alaska. The God she found there was not partial to any religious philosophy.
 ''God is not a man,'' Lindauer explained. ''God is this supreme, magnificent force, intelligent, gorgeous beyond any description. If you've seen Alaska, you've seen the face of God.''
Tucked away behind a mixed-use town house development, Kosmos Pharma, Richard Fuisz's place of business, is part of a Pynchonesque landscape in Northern Virginia where anonymous front offices and brass nameplates give few clues as to the actual nature of the businesses within. When I showed up at his office, Fuisz graciously invited me inside to talk. 
 A dark-haired, handsome man with a soigne charm, Fuisz, 64, who went to Georgetown Medical School and did postgraduate work in medicine at Harvard, was trained as a psychiatrist and has more than 200 patents listed under his name. According to its Web site, Kosmos Pharma specializes in making oral-drug-delivery systems. He has also run a modeling agency for Russian women and worked briefly in the White House under Lyndon Johnson. During the 70's and 80's, he says, he did business around the world -- in the Middle East, the Eastern bloc, the Soviet Union. 
 Citing unnamed sources, The Sunday Herald, a Scottish newspaper, reported in 2000 that Fuisz had been the C.I.A.'s most important agent in Damascus during the 80's. ''This is not an issue I can confirm or deny,'' Fuisz told The Herald. ''I am not allowed to speak about these issues. In fact, I can't even explain why I can't speak about these issues.'' 
 Fuisz confirmed that he saw Lindauer about once a week on avearage between 1994 and 2001 and that she would drop by to talk to him about her personal life as well as about her contacts with the Libyans and the Iraqis. He agreed to talk to me about Lindauer after requesting that his son, Joe, a lawyer, be present for our conversation. 
 ''Susan, to me, is one of those people who drift into your life,'' Fuisz said, after offering me a seat on his couch. ''She would drift into the office fairly often, or call. Usually those weren't just social calls. Those were calls about what she was doing, or trying to do,'' Fuisz explained. ''In the early years, her activism generally took an approach which was Arabist, but Arabist from the standpoint of trying to lift sanctions, so that children would do better, and trying to get medicines into countries -- principally I'm talking about Iraq and Libya.''
 After Sept. 11, 2001, Lindauer was no longer a welcome visitor to his office. ''Susan, in her discussions, went from benign, in my opinion, to malignant,'' he said. ''These discussions changed and now involved a very strong seditious bent.''
 Fuisz did not comment on the specifics of the conversations that Lindauer claimed to have had with Middle Eastern diplomats or whether he passed on the specifics of those conversations to anyone else. But he, like others who have known Lindauer over the years, had clearly thought long and hard about the perplexing geometry of her mind.
 ''I'd put it this way,'' Fuisz explained, cupping his palms like a collector presenting a rare species for inspection. ''She's daft enough that we could be sitting here, like we are now, and she might see a parrot fly in the window, flap its wings and land right here on the table,'' he said. ''But she's also smart enough not to necessarily say anything about it.'' 
 When I asked whether, in his opinion, Lindauer could have been recruited by an intelligence service, he paused for a long time before he responded. ''I would say that's a hard question to answer. If you're looking at it from the standpoint of an intelligent intelligence agency, absolutely not. She'd be the worst person you could ever recruit. If you're looking at it from the standpoint of my knowledge of Mideast intelligence services, are they dumb enough to recruit her, the answer is yes.'' 
To understand Lindauer's unlikely walk-on role in the history of the Iraq war, it is necessary to reverse your normal angle of vision and to imagine how she might have looked through the eyes of the diplomats and intelligence operatives who staffed the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations under Saddam Hussein. While Lindauer may have struck Ambassador Hasan and other Iraqi diplomats as strange, she had solid credentials to recommend her. An aide to congressmen and senators who held a graduate degree from the London School of Economics, she was also the cousin of the White House chief of staff. 
 Lindauer's letters on behalf of the Iraqis, which she sent to Bush financial backers, including Ken Lay, urging them to support the lifting of sanctions, were written in clear, confident prose. But there were also other letters whose odd details suggested that the Iraqis might have been more discerning in their choice of secret emissary. 
 ''I am deeply proud of my expertise on international conflict resolution, and my regrettably extraordinary gift for counterterrorism,'' Lindauer wrote in a letter addressed to President-elect Bush on Dec. 22, 2000. ''I have identified a dozen bombings before they happened with a high degree of accuracy and a number of assassination attempts on world leaders.'' 
 After the Sept. 11 attacks, Lindauer became a frequent visitor to the Iraqi Mission in New York. During a Sept. 18, 2001, trip to the mission, she had what she described in a letter to Card, the White House chief of staff, as a ''short, tense'' conversation with Hasan's successor, Ambassador Mohammad Al-Douri, in the embassy foyer. ''There's starting to be talk in Washington about Iraq's possible involvement in this attack,'' Lindauer told Card she said to Al-Douri. 
 ''It is not possible,'' Al-Douri is said to have replied. ''It is the Mossad who says this.'' The ambassador, she wrote, sounded ''abrupt and confident and stern.'' When Lindauer warned him not to do anything that would jeopardize the lifting of sanctions, the ambassador seemed surprised. 
 ''Of course!'' she recalled him as saying. ''We are ready for talks at any time.'' 
 In that same letter, she described coming back to New York to ''receive a communication from Baghdad addressed to me'' -- a message saying that the panic-stricken Iraqis were willing to ''meet any American official in a covert or incovert manner to discuss the common issues.'' 
 In October 2001, according to the federal indictment, she met with officers of Iraqi intelligence in New York. On Dec. 2, Lindauer wrote to Card again, to convey further news: The Iraqis were willing to permit the return of weapons inspectors and offered other concessions. ''These are not intended to limit the universe of possibilities, Andy,'' she wrote.
 The picture that emerges from Lindauer's letters is of Iraqi diplomats trying to feel their way through a fog. It is hard to judge what any of her messages from the Iraqi Foreign Ministry might mean, however, since they could be read only through the haze of Lindauer's naive and self-aggrandizing personality. In February 2002, soon after President Bush delivered his State of the Union address naming Iraq part of an ''axis of evil,'' the Iraqis invited Lindauer to Baghdad. 
 ''It was beautiful,'' she said of Al Rashid Hotel, where she stayed between her meetings with Iraqi officials. ''I had a suite, so it was very nice.''
 She wouldn't tell me who she met with or why, but she did describe what it felt like to be inside the room in which the meetings took place. ''When I first got there, I had the sense that -- I don't know how to put this, this is a very weird thing, it's like your imagination-working-kind-of-thing,'' she explained. ''I was in a room, and there were these mirrors, and I had this sense of Saddam Hussein being on the opposite side of the mirror looking in at me. Now I'm not saying that Saddam Hussein actually was there, but I had this very strong sense of presence, which was unlike anything I'd ever felt before, that was scrutinizing me up and down, ripping me apart. It was palpable.'' 
 After Lindauer's visit to Baghdad, there were no more secret messages from Iraq for Andrew Card. 
John Lindauer, Susan's younger brother, is used to his sister's unlikely stories -- about dating Arab arms dealers and late-night attempts on her life and her contacts with the C.I.A. A Harvard graduate, and now a successful commercial and music-video director in Los Angeles, he says he thinks that a strain of playacting and deception runs in his family. One of his most powerful childhood memories, he told me, is of watching his father, then 38, grow a mustache and dye his hair gray before being interviewed for the job of chancellor of the University of Alaska at Anchorage. ''Weaving a story to make contact with you, and making you want to be interested in that person, is not a cry for help,'' he said. ''It's just a way of reaching out to say: Remember me. I'm with you. Be interested in me.'' 
 One conversation John had with his sister in the summer of 2001 stuck in his mind for a different reason. ''So she goes, 'Listen, the gulf war isn't over,''' he told me over dinner at a sushi place on the Sunset Strip. '''There are plans in effect right now. They will be raining down on us from the skies.''' His sister told him that Lower Manhattan would be destroyed. ''And I was like, Yeah, whatever,'' he continued. When he woke up six weeks later to the news that two planes had crashed into the twin towers, and watched as ash settled on the window ledge of his sublet in Brooklyn, he had a dislocating sense of having his reality replaced by Susan's strange world -- an experience he would have again when he learned that his sister had been arrested by the F.B.I.
 Parke Godfrey, a close friend of Lindauer's for the last 15 years, is a professor of computer science at York University in Ontario. He says that Lindauer warned him not to take a job at N.Y.U. the summer before the Sept. 11 attacks. That Lindauer's outlandish predictions actually came true, Godfrey suggests, further encouraged the exalted sense of personal mission that brought her to Washington in the first place. 
 ''Susan is perfectly capable, in certain ways, to live a reasonable life, to take care of herself, to get around, and at any localized time, sitting at dinner, she's completely coherent,'' he said, skirting the blunt layman's question of whether his friend is playing with all her marbles. ''It's in these longer-term views of memory, in what she remembers, in how she's pieced the world together, that she functions unlike the way anyone else does,'' Godfrey concluded. ''It's not the same mental model that you and I use.''
''There is now a jihad,'' Susan Lindauer told me, rocking peacefully back and forth in her chair overlooking her untamed garden. ''Tragically, stupidly, we started it. We launched the first attack, which was unrighteous, and vicious and sadistic, and we are going to pay for this mistake. I think the Islamic world now is going to burn.'' 
 Sipping lemonade on her front porch in Takoma Park, I found myself sharing her paranoid landscape, observing a beige car pass by her house four times in the space of two hours, as the birds twittered in the trees and Lindauer's girlish voice detailed ''the horrific abuses, the sexual torture'' being visited on innocent Iraqis by coalition troops. That is why, she explained, in June 2003 she met with an F.B.I. agent posing as a Libyan intelligence officer who, according to the indictment, purported to be ''seeking to support resistance groups in postwar Iraq.'' Lindauer said that in those meetings she was seeking financial backing for a lawsuit against the United States and British governments for crimes she claimed they committed during the occupation of Iraq. She continued to exchange e-mail with the undercover agent until she was arrested.
 On my way back home to New York from Washington, I found a cellphone message from Ken Lisaius, a White House spokesman. While Andrew Card declined to speak to me directly about his cousin's letters, Lisaius said, Card did have a statement that might answer at least some of my remaining questions about Lindauer's case.
 ''This was a very sad and personal incident involving a distant relative of Andy Card,'' Lisaius said in the carefully calibrated cadence that is meant to assure worried citizens that the world remains a more or less rational place, no matter how weird the circumstances. ''He in turn reported various attempts by her to contact him to appropriate officials, and he has cooperated fully with appropriate officials on this matter.''

 A YEAR ago, it was still possible to debate whether the phenomenon of Bush hating had taken on the virulent dimensions of Clinton loathing in the 1990's. On the eve of the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, there's no longer any argument. By any measure, Bush bashing is bigger. 
 On talk radio, a Howard Stern radicalized by FCC prudery and Clear Channel censorship has eclipsed Rush Limbaugh. On cable television, the Bush-mocking ''Daily Show'' gets better ratings than the right-wing ranters on Fox. And on the tables at Barnes & Noble, Al Franken, Molly Ivins and Michael Moore find more prominent display than the struggling firm of O'Reilly, Hannity & Coulter. Some other recent book titles: ''The Lies of George W. Bush.'' ''Fraud: The Strategy Behind the Bush Lies and Why the Media Didn't Tell You.'' ''The Bush-Hater's Handbook.'' ''The I Hate George W. Bush Reader'' has done well enough to spawn an ''I Hate Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft, Donald Rumsfeld, Condi Rice . . . Reader.'' Before long, we'll be hating Bush's subcabinet. 
 What may or may not be the terminal stage of Bush-phobia has also motivated artists and entertainers who are not, by inclination, partisans. Bruce Springsteen and a group of rockers who have avoided taking sides in previous elections will tour next month in support of the Democrats -- not out of any affection for John Kerry, but because of their horror at the prospect of a Bush second term. In the past, Hollywood has seldom risked box office take by producing message movies. But this election cycle's releases include not just the Bush-ripping crockumentary ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' but a Halliburton-themed remake of ''The Manchurian Candidate'' and the forthcoming John Sayles film ''Silver City,'' the plot of which revolves around a grammar-garbling Western pol put up for office by nefarious corporate honchos. The novelist Nicholson Baker has just published a Bush assassination fantasy. 
 In the category of not naturally polemical writers pulled into the fray by the Bush presidency, one can also place Maureen Dowd, a New York Times columnist who is often reticent with her political opinions; the slashing literary and cultural critic James Wolcott; and Graydon Carter, the editor of a glam magazine with a nonideological focus (until lately) on wealth, class and celebrity. These are ordinarily calm customers, but the Bush administration has somehow blown their cool. 
 Why have these writers come to so hate President Bush? Perhaps the first thing to say is that, in fact, they don't hate him. The right's Clinton hating was largely personality-driven. Conservatives objected to the previous administration's policies, to be sure, but what brought their blood to a low simmer was the sight of a man they deemed immoral, dishonest and manipulative (much in the way the left reacted to Nixon and Lyndon Johnson). Clinton's success as president only made his enemies madder. 
 Bush's opponents, by comparison, despise the substance of his presidency. They may light on such irritants as the President's smirk, his sense of entitlement, his laziness, his verbal incoherence or his righteous dunderheadness. But these are largely stand-ins for their opposition to the Bush administration's catastrophically unplanned occupation of Iraq, its self-defeating alienation of allies, its favoritism toward the rich and the energy industry, its hostility to the environment and civil liberties, and the qualified legitimacy of the 2000 election. Bush's critics get lathered up denouncing his misdeeds, his plutocratic backers and his lame appointees. But they often admit that they, well, kinda like the guy personally. 
 ''Bushworld'' is a case in point. In a collection of columns written mostly over the past four years, Maureen Dowd sometimes seems torn between feelings of affection for the Bush clan and the view that they are woefully inadequate to the task of governing. A sometimes coy commentator, Dowd lets her views trickle out in caustic observations and witticisms. ''All presidents are in a bubble,'' she writes in a sharp introduction, ''but the boy king was so insulated he was in a thermos.'' In her Kennebunkport burlesque of ''Dynasty,'' the ''dauphin'' is protected from reality by his ''regents,'' foremost among them Vice President Dick Cheney, typically referred to as Bush's ''baby sitter'' or ''chaperone.''
 Dowd views politics through the twin lenses of pop culture and pop psychology, and it is the latter she most often emphasizes in relation to the Bush family. She sees the 2000 election as the culmination of an Oedipal drama or, as she describes it, ''the most astonishing and dangerous subordination of American history to particular psyches I've seen.'' George W., long the family black sheep, is driven both by the need to win his father's respect and the desire to symbolically slay him. To Dowd, invading Iraq had less to do with W.M.D. than the ''chance for W. to complete his transformation from the screwup son to the son who fixed his father's screwups.'' She calls the war, which she viewed skeptically from the outset, ''a Freudian tango that was rocking the world.'' 
 As with any assemblage of in-the-moment journalism, some of Dowd's columns hold up better than others. Among her best are an account of a visit to the lingerie section of a department store in Riyadh, which led to a frightening encounter with the Saudi vice cops, and a column entitled ''Pappy and Poppy'' in which she compares the Kennedy and Bush clans. ''The Bushes were trying to de-Anglicize and lose the silver spoon while the Kennedys were trying to Anglicize and seize it,'' she writes. Less collectible is some of Dowd's sketch comedy (Cheney and Rummy sipping Scotch in the hot tub), which can degenerate to an Art Buchwald level. But in the main, her daily wit stands the test of hard covers. 
 Dowd's consistent view of the gulf war II as a misbegotten adventure driven by a confluence of conservative ideology and patricidal urges is looking more and more prescient. Yet in the end, she can't muster the kind of animosity toward Bush that she leveled at the Clintons, husband and wife. The Clintons, it seems, had the intelligence to be held culpable for their actions. Dowd depicts the ''boy emperor,'' by contrast, as the victim of a family psychodynamic he is incapable even of recognizing, and as the yielding vehicle for mean-spirited aides pursuing private agendas. Several years before Jonathan Demme's remake, she had cast W. in the role of the Manchurian Candidate (with Lynne Cheney in the Angela Lansbury role). The vice president, of course, supervised the brainwashing. 
 James Wolcott's ''Attack Poodles'' finds a less direct avenue to attack the administration. His book is not about Bush per se, but rather about pundits who serve as the president's defenders and apologists. Wolcott sees these para-journalistic blowhards, primarily those who appear on MSNBC, the Fox News Channel and CNN, as having played a crucial role in support of the invasion of Iraq. He holds the commentariat, if anything, more responsible than the Bushies themselves for misleading the public about Saddam Hussein's W.M.D., Iraq's role in the 9/11 attacks and the threat it posed to the United States. Wolcott describes the period leading up to the war as nothing short of a ''propaganda coup.'' 
 Only someone who had spent far too much time watching ''The O'Reilly Factor'' with a notepad in hand could advance this argument with a straight face. There was, as I remember it, a fairly vigorous debate about the wisdom of invading Iraq in the months leading up to the war, even if one did not find the most sophisticated expressions of it on cable news. Almost all of this argument was premised, however, on the erroneous assumption that Saddam retained an active W.M.D. program, a belief not questioned at the time by Wolcott or most others who today accuse Bush of intentional deception. If the administration was able to overcome resistance to the war, it had less to do with the hosannas emanating from the Fox choirloft than with the thinness of Democratic opposition in Congress. 
 Indeed, it a questionable whether the broadcasters Wolcott chain-saws have a strong persuasive effect on the public, as opposed to simply reinforcing the biases of a relatively small number of like-minded viewers (FNC's top-rated show has an audience of 2 million to 3 million, as compared with 7 million to 12 million for each of the network evening news broadcasts). The audience for political gab skews old, male and conservative; MSNBC and CNN have tried to emulate Fox's right-wing bully boys not because of marching orders from Karl Rove but because of Fox's commercial success. The liberal caricature Phil Donahue was axed after a few months by MSNBC not because it prefers Republicans but because his ratings were too weak to make the show profitable. The problem may be that libs don't look to politics for entertainment the way cons do, preferring their news straight up, without a twist. 
 That said, ''Attack Poodles'' is irresistible political entertainment from and for the left. It is a true sadistic pleasure to watch Wolcott exact revenge for the hours he has wasted watching the likes of Joe Scarborough, Michael Savage and Chris Matthews. A skilled hit man, Wolcott sharpens his instruments and takes his time in setting up a kill. In his assault on Peggy Noonan, he quotes a passage from her memoir, ''What I Saw at the Revolution,'' in which she waxed romantic about glimpsing one of the President Reagan's brown shoes. It was ''not a big foot, not formidable, maybe a little . . . frail,'' Noonan wrote. ''I imagine cradling it in my arms, protecting it from unsmooth roads.'' 
 ''His other foot,'' Wolcott writes, ''would just have to fend for itself.''
 Most of the thugs Wolcott ices had it coming, but after a while, his selection of victims does begin to look lopsided. After demolishing conservative pundit after pundit, he finds his hero and it's CNN business anchor Lou Dobbs. This is because Dobbs has been thumping a left-populist tub about outsourcing and corporate malfeasance (after doing his part to help inflate the stock market bubble in the late 90's). The free pass given the author's allies of the moment -- Michael Moore, Joe Conason, Eric Alterman, Sidney Blumenthal -- calls into question his choice of targets like Thomas Friedman, Andrew Sullivan and my colleague Mickey Kaus, shrewder commentators with whom he simply disagrees. 
 One wonders, indeed, what Wolcott might say about Graydon Carter's ''What We've Lost'' were Wolcott not employed by Vanity Fair. Carter's book is not the strident polemic one might have expected, given the author's Hollywood milieu. Indeed, his book errs mostly in the opposite direction, that of an underwritten compendium of data. Carter is constantly breaking prose stride in favor of bullet points, and at one point pads out 13 pages with an alphabetical listing of the coalition dead in Iraq. One can almost hear the author wheezing as he staggers across the finish line, with a chapter that recapitulates his previous complaints about the Bush administration Harper's-Index-style. 
 Carter credits no fewer than 11 researchers, but this team has not saved him from some cringe-making errors. On his first page, he describes the invasion of Iraq as ''a war of choice with a country that was neither an enemy nor a real threat.'' Think what you like about the threat part, but to describe a country firing daily at American planes in the no-flight zone as something other than an enemy is not right. On the second page, Carter describes the American education system before Bush as ''in many ways the envy of the world.'' Perhaps he was thinking of Japan? But what grates here is not so much the sloppiness or the flat prose as the absence of even the slightest complication. Carter describes himself as a fan of Ronald Reagan. Surely from that point of view, not every single thing Bush has ever done in his whole entire life can be utterly deplorable. What about increasing AIDS funding? What about deposing the Taliban and bringing NATO into Afghanistan? 
 Yet even Carter, who depicts Bush's presidency in the gravest possible terms, seems unable to muster any personal antagonism toward the fellow. In a recent interview, he said he thought he would like Bush if he knew him. Why, after he has ''curtailed our freedoms, mortgaged our economy, savaged our environment and damaged our standing in the world,'' as the jacket of Carter's book has it, does this president remain so hard for the people who condemn him in such terms to hate? 
 The best explanation, I think, is that Bush's critics esteem him too little to despise. Most of the current wave of animosity posits a marionette in the White House rather than a malefactor. Like Warren Harding or William McKinley, Bush is seen by his enemies on the left not as a prime mover, but as the useful idiot of the reactionary right. Most of them share the view of Garry Trudeau, who portrays Bush in ''Doonesbury'' as an asterisk in a Roman helmet. Accurate or not -- and I do tend to agree with it -- the view of Bush as a basically limited and shallow person has certain consequences. You can't despise a simpleton for his simplicity. You can't hate a man who isn't there.

HEADLINE: Subpoena Seeks Records About Delegate Lists on Web

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation and is demanding records regarding Internet postings by critics of the Bush administration that list the names of Republican delegates and urge protesters to give them an unwelcome reception in New York City.
 Federal prosecutors said in a grand jury subpoena that the information was needed as part of an investigation into possible voter intimidation. Protesters and civil rights advocates argued that the Web postings were legitimate political dissent, not threats or intimidation.
 The investigation, conducted by the Secret Service, comes at a time when federal officials have begun an aggressive effort to prevent what they say could be violence by demonstrators at the convention this week and at other major political events. Large-scale demonstrations in New York began over the weekend. 
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation has questioned at least several dozen would-be protesters about whether they knew of any plans for violent demonstrations, and it has directed agents nationwide to identify possible criminal plots. Some Democrats in Congress and civil rights advocates have criticized the efforts, saying the inquiries have had a chilling effect on free speech.The accusations are likely to intensify with the disclosure of the subpoena regarding the Republican delegates.
 ''People have a right to be heard politically, and the names of a lot of these delegates are already public anyway,'' said Matt Toups, 22, a system administrator for the Web site under federal investigation. ''This is just part of the government's campaign to intimidate people into not saying things.''
 A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the department was sensitive to First Amendment concerns. But when officials were alerted to the posting of the names and identifying information for delegates, they were concerned about the prospect that delegates could be harassed or become victims of identity theft, and they wanted to know why the information was posted, the official said.
 ''When you're confronted with something like this, you can't just ignore it,'' the official said. ''I think people would expect us to look into it and find out whether there is anything going on here that goes beyond the bounds of free speech.''
 The Justice Department issued the subpoena on Aug. 19 to Calyx Internet Access, an Internet service provider in New York City, after a Secret Service agent asked the company to turn over information about postings on a client's site, nyc.indymedia.org. Calyx refused to turn over the information, citing privacy concerns, and a subpoena was issued. 
 The subpoena seeks subscriber information, and contacts and billing records for the Indy Media site. It says the information is needed to investigate possible violations of the federal criminal code barring efforts to intimidate, threaten or coerce voters.
 The Indy Media site is run by the NYC Independent Media Center, which describes itself as a grass-roots group committed to using media tools ''for promoting social and economic justice in the New York City area.'' The site includes several lists containing the names of many delegates to the Republican convention, along with e-mail addresses, phone numbers and the hotels where some were expected to stay, as well as links to a site called rncdelegates.com. Most of the lists were posted anonymously or by demonstrators calling themselves the RNC Delegates Working Group. One list includes more than 2,200 delegates, or nearly half the expected total. In publicizing the information, organizers said in a posting that they were trying to supply groups opposed to the Republican National Committee ''with data on the delegates to use in whatever way they see fit.'' 
 ''The delegates should know not only what people think of the platform that they will ratify, but that they are not welcome in New York City,'' organizers said in a posting.
 ''This upcoming mobilization in New York is not about the delegates, it's about who and what is going to be affected by the Republican Party platform that these delegates will proudly put their name to and will ratify,'' the message continued. ''It goes beyond that, as we raise our voices and fists and proclaim that this rotten system of capitalist exploitation and imperialist domination must be swept away.''
 The site includes a few retorts from backers of President Bush, with one message asking: ''where is the list of Democratic delegates so I can 'use it as I see fit?''' 
 Officials at the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Calyx, the Internet service provider, said they were aware of no postings that encouraged violence or intimidation of Republican delegates, and they said the site contained political dialogue and information that was protected by the First Amendment.
 ''We can't see any legitimate purpose behind this investigation, and it looks to us like another attempt to repress legitimate political dissent,'' said Ann Beeson, associate legal director for the A.C.L.U. 
 The Republican National Committee has declined to release the names of delegates, saying it does not want to invite harassment. A.C.L.U. officials said the names of delegates and details like which hotels they planned to use were available in the media and on Internet sites, including some state Republican Web sites. 
 Federal courts have traditionally set a high bar in deciding what constitutes threatening speech that goes beyond First Amendment protections, saying the threat of lawlessness must be specific and imminent.
 In one significant case, a jury in Oregon ordered a group of anti-abortion activists to pay $109 million in damages after posting an Old West-style wanted poster, portraying named abortion doctors as ''baby butchers.'' But an appellate court reversed the award. Parts of the case are pending.
 In another Internet case decided in June, a Saudi graduate student was cleared of charges that the Web sites he ran had provided material support for terrorists. The student argued he had little to do with creating the material that was posted.
 In 2001, the Seattle chapter of Indy Media was served with a warrant by the F.B.I. demanding electronic records after officials said stolen material related to a free trade meeting and protests in Canada showed up on its site. The group fought the request and said it did not turn over any records.
 In the latest flare-up, A.C.L.U. officials said they planned to turn over to federal officials on Monday the subpoenaed information on system administrators and registration for the Indy Media site. But that will not reveal who posted the delegates' names. Mr. Toups, a student at Carnegie Mellon University who volunteers for Indy Media, said the group -- by design -- did not require the names of Web posters and could not identify the people who posted the names even if required. 
 ''We respect the anonymity of our contributors, and we don't track addresses,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Of Campaigns and Breakfast Cereals

BYLINE: By Bob Herbert. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''Most national issues today are so complicated, so difficult to understand and have opinions on, that they either intimidate or, more often, bore the average voter.''
 So wrote Harry Treleaven, an advertising man who took a leave of absence in the mid-1960's to work on the Texas Congressional campaign of 42-year-old George Herbert Walker Bush. Mr. Treleaven was not upset by the fact that voters were turned off by the complexity of important political issues. After all, he was in advertising. The goal was to sell product, not explore issues. 
 Mr. Treleaven became a key figure in Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign. Joe McGinniss, in his best-selling book about that campaign, ''The Selling of the President,'' said of Mr. Treleaven:
 ''There was no issue when it came to selling Ford automobiles; there were only the product, the competition and the advertising. He saw no reason why politics should be any different.''
 Mr. Treleaven died in 1998, but the path-breaking cynicism of his type of politics hangs like a shroud over this year's presidential campaign.
 You want complicated issues? Start with Iraq -- a war with no clearly defined goal, not even the remotest timetable for victory, and no exit strategy whatsoever. The ad men (and women) will reduce this monumental tragedy to crisp, poll-tested campaign sound bites.
 Or consider the economy. We're in a new world of work in which good jobs at good pay with good benefits are ever more hard to find. Despite the administration's insistence that the economy is strong and getting stronger, there is no light at the end of this dismal tunnel. Job growth is anemic. The middle class is being relentlessly squeezed. And the Census Bureau tells us that in 2003, for the third year in a row, the number of Americans who are poor increased.
 As David Leonhardt wrote in The Times on Friday, ''The economy's troubles, which first affected high-income families even more than the middle class and poor, have recently hurt families at the bottom and in the middle significantly more than those at the top.''
 These are issues that should be ruthlessly explored, but the politicians, their handlers and much of the media have taken their cues from Harry Treleaven. You don't want to bore the readers or viewers or voters with anything too complicated. A well-rehearsed comment or two will suffice, followed by the jokes on Leno and Letterman, and then it's on to the ''real world'' of Paris and Kobe and whatever.
 This week's Republican convention in New York is a rigidly scripted theatrical event that will garner a grand total of three hours of live coverage on network television -- a reprise of the Democrats' rigidly scripted extravaganza in Boston last month. Anyone who drifts off message will be viewed as a nut.
 So we won't get anything but pap about Iraq. We'll be told about the miraculous economic healing powers of the Bush tax cuts. We'll be told that the era of George Bush II has been a rousing success for America.
 Serious voters who would like to hear a discussion (from the leaders of both parties) about why we are in Iraq and when and how we might get out of there will be disappointed. So will voters interested in exploring ideas about the leadership role of the United States in the post-9/11 world, which is at least as important as the role thrust upon the U.S. in the aftermath of World War II.
 More scary stories are emerging about global warming, and our dependence on foreign oil is undermining our security like never before. But these topics, too, are complex, and therefore, according to the advertising folks and media gurus, too difficult and boring for general consumption.
 In other words, we're a nation of nitwits, and a presidential campaign at a critical moment in world history will be spoon-fed to us like an ad for Wheaties.
 Raymond Price, a speechwriter for Nixon in the 1968 campaign, was as contemptuous of substance in politics as Treleaven. ''It's not what's there that counts,'' he wrote, ''it's what's projected.'' In Price's view, ''Voters are basically lazy, basically uninterested in making an effort to understand what we're talking about.''
 Voters could revolt against this kind of humiliating treatment. But that would happen only if the Treleavens and Prices of the world were wrong.

HEADLINE: Funds Left Unclaimed for 9/11 Aid to Small Firms as Deadline Nears

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
With four months remaining in a 9/11 program intended to pour $155 million into small businesses that move to or stay in Lower Manhattan, a third of the money remains to be awarded or pledged.
 Critics of the program, which began in March 2002, say that overly tight rules and a failure to recognize customary business practices in the area have kept more of the fund from being used, and have deprived many businesses needing the aid from getting it or from getting a just amount. 
 New York State officials who run the program, and business leaders who praise it, say they are confident that all or virtually all of the fund will be committed by the Dec. 31 deadline. They defend the rules as necessary to ensure that the fund is soundly administered and that it provides maximum benefit to the area, whose economy plunged after the 2001 terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center. 
 The officials said that the usual pickup in lease renewals after the end of summer would bolster the number of applicants by year's end. And as Dec. 31 nears, they predicted, there will be a surge of applications from businesses that have already renewed leases or signed new ones, but have not gotten around to applying to the fund, the Small Firm Attraction and Retention Grant Program, which is intended for businesses with up to 200 employees that renew leases or sign new leases in the area below Canal Street. Other Sept. 11 aid programs also had a rush of applicants as their deadline approached, they noted.
 ''It's tracking as we expected,'' Kevin S. Corbett, chief operating officer of the Empire State Development Corporation, which runs the program, said of the $103 million awarded or pledged as of last week. He called it a ''successful component'' of government efforts to first stabilize, then stimulate the area's commercial scene. More than 1,600 businesses, employing 25,000 people, have received the money or had it committed, Mr. Corbett's agency said, and more than 200 applications are pending. 
 Many business owners, like Pat Tevrow, say they are pleased with the fund. She and her husband, Eric Tevrow, have opened three restaurants in Lower Manhattan since 9/11. For the first two, Fresh, on Reade Street, and Shore, on Murray Street, they have so far received a total of $150,000 from the program. Nearly $60 million has been paid out over all.
 ''It's just nice to have a boost,'' she said, adding that they would soon apply for grants for their newest place, Coast, on Liberty Street.
 Joshua Aaron, president of Business Technology Partners, which designs data centers and trading floors for financial service firms, spoke similarly. His company received $57,500 after signing a lease at 111 Broadway, for space just a few blocks from ground zero that it had been subletting. But the sublease had run out shortly after Sept. 11. The company's recovery ''certainly would have been more difficult'' without the money, he said. 
 Most awards are paid in two installments, 18 months apart; the second can be larger or smaller than the first, depending on the number of workers a business has at 18 months. First installments average $33,000, Empire State Development's figures show, and few businesses have reached the point of second payments. 
 Critics of the program contend that the eligibility rules have excluded many deserving businesses, especially by not taking into account customary business practices in the financial district and Chinatown. 
 To qualify for the fund, a store, restaurant or company renewing a lease must have been in its location on Sept. 11, 2001. In most cases, its expiring lease must end no later than Dec. 31 of this year, and the renewal must be for at least five years. The business must apply for the money by Dec. 31.
 A new business or one moving into the area must sign a minimum five-year lease by Dec. 31. Those having done so by tomorrow are required to submit grant applications by Dec. 31; those signing between Wednesday and Dec. 31 have until next April 1 to apply.
 Grants for renewed leases are $5,000 or $3,500 an employee, depending on proximity to the trade center site. They are $3,500 an employee for new leases. Businesses may count only employees whose taxes they withhold, but not those who work on a commission basis and pay their taxes directly to the government, known as 1099 workers, for the number of the federal form which the companies send to tell them their earnings at the end of the year.
 Their exclusion is ''a serious problem,'' said Ann Kayman, chief executive of the New York Grant Company, which helps small and midsize businesses apply for government aid. ''A lot of insurance brokers, real estate brokers and securities and commodities brokers pay their people on a 1099 basis.''
 But such people ''don't count'' for the program, she said, ''even if they work full time on the site,'' as many do, ''spending money in the area, contributing to it.''
 A similar program for large companies does permit 1099 people to be counted, Ms. Kayman noted, calling this unfair.
 In October 2002, the Hunter Realty Organization signed a lease for office space for itself at 61 Broadway, after subletting space elsewhere in the building for seven years. 
 The firm received a $10,500 first installment from the grant fund, based on its three secretaries, whose taxes the firm withholds. But it would have received $50,000 more if it could have counted its 15 workers paid on the 1099 basis.
 ''They have permanent positions,'' said a Hunter Realty owner, Richard Selig. ''I definitely feel discriminated against.'' The larger grant would have helped significantly, he said, because business remained ''down an average of 50 percent'' two years after the terrorism attack.
 Mr. Corbett of Empire State Development said that 1099 workers were not counted because ''the ability for us to monitor them -- are they there or not there -- is something we can't do,'' given the 1,600 companies in the small firm program. 
 ''It's easier to monitor'' the number of such workers in the program for larger businesses, he said, because it has awarded grants for just 75 companies.
 In Chinatown, the requirement for five-year leases or extensions excludes many businesses because ''many landlords just don't provide'' agreements of such length in this area, said John Wang, president of the Asian American Business Development Center. ''They give one-year leases, two-year,'' he said, which penalizes businesses that have been in the area for years, and ''are committed to remaining.'' Program officials have long said that a minimum five-year lease is needed to assure a long-term commitment.
 Still others criticize the requirement that current leases expire by Dec. 31. This seems especially unfair to those, like Leonard Altabet, who has operated an optical shop, Worthy Eyes, on Worth Street, for 25 years. ''I was closed 18 days'' after Sept. 11, he said. ''My business is off 25 percent from 2000.''
 Worthy Eyes' current lease runs till 2006, making him ineligible for the fund, but a grant from the program was given to an optical shop that opened last year four blocks away. Program officials say the Dec. 31 cutoff is reasonable. Of the suggestion that the program treats newcomers to the area better than its veterans, Mr. Corbett said the area's overall needs required attracting new businesses to increase the ''aggregate number of companies.'' A leader of a major Lower Manhattan business group agreed with Mr. Corbett that over all the program has been successful. Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, said, ''It has been a very powerful incentive, both in keeping firms here and attracting firms here.''

HEADLINE: All Things Considered, NPR's Growing Clout Alarms Member Stations

BYLINE: By LYNETTE CLEMETSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
With a newly robust endowment burning holes in its not-for-profit pockets, National Public Radio is in the midst of a major expansion. But NPR's ambition has stirred anxiety within the public radio system over how to preserve the character and financial viability of local stations in the ever larger shadow of the national production service they created more than 30 years ago as a modest support operation.
 NPR, a member organization governed in part by local stations, is pumping $15 million into its news division over the next three years, using interest from a recent bequest of more than $236 million from Joan B. Kroc, the widow of Ray A. Kroc of McDonald's. NPR executives have touted the expansion as unmatched in a time of media cutbacks and consolidations. 
 But at a meeting earlier this month in Los Angeles between NPR executives and station managers from the top 25 radio markets to discuss cultivating future major gifts, the NPR team faced a flurry of pointed questions about its long-term intentions. 
 Among the questions, according to several station representatives: Was NPR trying to woo away coveted local donors? What, if anything, would NPR give to member stations from the Kroc endowment? And what about rumors that NPR was considering taking its top-rated shows to satellite radio? 
 ''The local stations created NPR as a newsgathering organization for us,'' said Alan Chartock, president and chief executive of WAMC Northeast Public Radio, a regional network that serves seven states from Pennsylvania to Vermont. ''If the tail is now wagging the dog to literally compete with us, then we have to protect ourselves.'' 
 Kevin Klose, the president and chief executive of NPR, said it was merely responding to an increased appetite for the type of wide-ranging, in-depth news that public radio can provide. NPR's audience has doubled in the past 10 years to roughly 22 million listeners a week, according to Arbitron.
 ''We want to be the authoritative source for broadcast journalism in this country,'' Mr. Klose said, ''the place people go to first.''
 The first fruits of the expansion will become evident soon. To cover more breaking news and to provide more investigative and analytical reporting, NPR is spending $4 million this year for everything from domestic beat reporters to expanded foreign bureaus to pricey satellite telephones that transmit higher quality sound. 
 Many public radio executives contend that NPR's growth offers potential benefits for all players. While people are spending less time listening to radio over all, public radio's share of radio listenership is up, from roughly 1 percent 20 years ago to more than 5 percent of all listeners today, according to the Station Resource Group, a public radio strategy and analysis organization.
 Much of the anxiety about NPR's growth has less to do with changes at NPR than with broader changes on the radio landscape. 
 Satellite radio companies are fast expanding their services to include channels with public-radio-like content and sensibility. Last month XM Satellite Radio -- the largest satellite operator, with 2.1 million subscribers -- announced that it had hired Bob Edwards, the former host of NPR's flagship news program ''Morning Edition,'' for a competing morning broadcast.
 That move sparked fears among public radio stations that NPR, to remain competitive, might consider offering ''Morning Edition'' and its other staple, ''All Things Considered,'' to Sirius Satellite Radio, XM's rival. The two NPR-produced programs are keys to sustaining listenership and fund-raising for many public radio stations, which pay millions in annual dues and programming fees to NPR to support their production. 
 ''These programs have required an enormous public investment,'' said Ruth Seymour, general manager of KCRW in Santa Monica, Calif. ''To simply sell them to a commercial entity is completely against the principles of public radio.''
 NPR has a contract to program two Sirius channels, NPR Talk and NPR Now. But Mr. Klose said there were no plans to add the top-rated news programs to its satellite lineup against station wishes. ''We will respond to the will of the system,'' he said. ''And the will of the system right now is that they should be where they are.''
 Still, executives at both NPR and the two satellite companies speak of their continuing flirtation as something that will eventually bloom into a more serious relationship. 
 Jay Clark, executive vice president of programming at Sirius, said he hoped to add NPR's top programs to his schedule ''down the line.'' And XM is poised to approach NPR when its contract with Sirius expires in 2007. 
 ''I love 'Morning Edition' and 'All Thing Considered,''' said Hugh Panero, XM's president and chief executive. ''I would love, when it becomes appropriate, to explore having them on XM Satellite Radio, and I hope NPR would be open to exploring making them available to the largest possible audience.''
 As stations confront inevitable changes in the structure and distribution of public radio, they are also being forced to examine their own reliance on NPR. While local stations created NPR in 1970 to act as a centralized producer and distributor to supplement their own programming, it now provides up to half of the content for many of the more than 770 stations that make up the country's public radio system. 
 For years stations have sought to diversify their programming options. Public Radio International, which was also created by stations and has become NPR's primary competitor, markets and distributes programs produced by local stations, like ''Marketplace,'' the popular business and economics report produced by Minnesota Public Radio, and Michael Feldman's ''Whad'Ya Know,'' a weekly entertainment show produced by Wisconsin Public Radio.
 This year Minnesota Public Radio moved to strengthen its position as a content provider by forming American Public Media, which independently distributes programs like Garrison Keillor's ''Prairie Home Companion.'' 
 But the newer national distributors, too, are changing with the times. Both Public Radio International and American Public Media are providing content for satellite radio. 
 ''Listeners are embracing new technologies,'' said Jim Russell, general manager of American Public Media West and the creator of ''Marketplace.'' ''If you don't get on the train, it's going to leave the station. It's as if the makers and users are stretching their arms trying to reach one another in new ways, and in the middle there are the stations trying to figure out an economic model to make the new reality work.'' 
 To remain viable, many managers say that their local stations must gain more leverage vis-a-vis NPR by producing and promoting more of the kind of distinctive, localized programs and segments that help shape public radio's eclectic character. 
 ''We have to work very hard to make sure NPR sees our relationship as a joint partnership and an opportunity to work together as opposed to them being highly resourced and the stations being merely a vehicle to transmit their programs,'' said Laura Walker, president and chief executive of WNYC in New York. ''I think the jury is still out as to whether they get it. But I'm hoping that they will.''
 After building for years, the imbalance in resources between local stations and NPR has been exacerbated by the Kroc endowment. The donation was facilitated by Ms. Kroc's long relationship with her local public radio station, KPBS in San Diego. The gift, and the future development that it has made possible, Mr. Klose said, made NPR executives realize that there should be a joint strategic plan with the stations to cultivate other major donations. 
 One idea thrown out by Mr. Klose and others at the meeting in Los Angeles was to allow NPR to court donors in local markets more directly. ''We may have 22 million listeners, but we can't tell you who they are,'' he said. ''The stations have those databases. The Joan Kroc gift demonstrates that there is potential for fund-raising out there in the country that we need to explore.''
 Talk of directly courting local benefactors left many at the meeting squeamish. 
 ''NPR has had its appetite whet by this gift,'' said Torey Malatia, president and general manager of Chicago Public Radio. ''It's kind of stunning to many of us in the system, because having that kind of money in the endowment is like a dream. But all it's done is create a scramble for even more. Now they want to know if there is a way to come into communities to meet people, wine and dine them and get more gifts.'' 
 Mr. Malatia and other station managers say that NPR's growth is ultimately good for the entire public radio system but that it will require a shift in the way stations and NPR view and work with one another. 
 Many in public radio speak of the system as a big, dysfunctional but close-knit and loyal family. That perspective, Mr. Malatia said, is perilously out of step with the times. 
 ''NPR has gotten so good that it needs to be managed as a business, rather than as a familial adjunct to stations,'' he said. ''Many of us have been caught sleeping, and we have to get moving, so that we can stand with NPR, each of us doing something distinct, but the sum of which amounts to an irreplaceable public service.''

HEADLINE: Warily, Connecticut Sets Its Agenda for New Roads

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
When federal transportation experts arrived in Hartford way back in 1957, they expected to talk about how the nation's new interstate highway system would save American cities, and they expected to meet praise for their promise of pavement. 
 Instead they met Lewis Mumford, the writer and critic and one of the speakers at the symposium, ''The New Highways: Challenge to the Metropolitan Region.'' Mr. Mumford all but told the highway men to get out of town, to leave cities alone because no mere road, he said, could speed urban America out of its complicated postwar predicament of poverty, congestion and flight.
 ''The highway people were just shocked,'' said Richard F. Weingroff, a writer and unofficial historian at the Federal Highway Administration. ''They came away amazed that they were not treated as the heroes they thought themselves to be.'' 
 Nearly half a century later, with the highways Mr. Mumford feared long since built, Connecticut has yet to make its peace with the roads that now run across its ancient glacial valleys and colonial-era ports. Its cities certainly have not been saved, even if a handful show forward momentum. 
 The question now, as it was then, is this: Just what can be done that will preserve the state's rural northern corners and historic coastal areas while also nurturing its urban economies and accommodating the reality that Connecticut is a crucial Northeast crossroads?
 ''I think we need to establish the priorities, put recommendations for funding on the table,'' Gov. M. Jodi Rell told reporters last week after meeting with the state's top transportation administrators. ''I also think that we need to assess how the public feels about the priorities. What is important in lower Fairfield County may not be important in Killingly, for example, or Killingworth,'' she said.
 The Transportation Strategy Board is considering surveying residents next year to find out their transportation wishes and what they might be willing to pay for them. The board says increases in gas and sales taxes as well as new tolls could be necessary.
 There is no shortage of plans.
 Should the state widen Interstate 95 east of Branford to ease congestion in growing southeastern Connecticut, in part to accommodate gamblers on their way to Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun, the state's thriving Indian casinos? Should it add a commuter rail line from New Haven through Hartford and on to Springfield, Mass., potentially realigning the way many people live and work in southern New England? Should it build busways near Hartford to better connect the embattled capital city with its suburbs? And how can Bradley International Airport become a greater asset? 
 There is, however, a shortage of money.
 Connecticut, which has long received more from the federal government in highway money than it has contributed in gas taxes, is in danger of losing money to fast-growing states in the South and West under the highway bill that has been pending for nearly a year. 
 ''In general the Northeast receives back more than it sends to Washington,'' said Charles S. Barone, the state's transportation planning director.
 The state's small but influential Congressional delegation argues that the large and needy Northeast region is increasingly dependent on the infrastructure of small, slow-growing Connecticut.
 ''You can't just look at our population and say that sums up our need,'' Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat who is on the conference committee working on the bill, said in an interview. ''Because we're the bridge. We're the path you've got to go across.'' 
 Aside from the competing interests nationally, within the state the battle over which projects to finance is intense. 
 ''You can't road-build your way out of this,'' said the New Haven mayor, John DeStefano, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2006. Mr. DeStefano and Mayor Eddie Perez of Hartford want a commuter rail line to supplement the Amtrak service that runs north-south through the middle of the state.
 But their ambitions must compete with the needs of the overburdened Metro-North commuter line, which endures frequent breakdowns and a shortage of working rail cars. And while the state considers widening I-95 in the east, drivers will be swerving for many months past the site of the collapsed interstate bridge in Bridgeport -- it fell in March when a tanker carrying 12,000 gallons of home heating fuel collided with a car -- that brought Northeast traffic to a standstill.
 ''There's a lot of needs out there,'' said Mr. Barone, the transportation planning director.
 There is also a long history of division over how to meet those needs. And, perhaps, there may be some irony in the fact that Connecticut now finds itself fighting for transportation funding.
 Mr. Weingroff, of the Federal Highway Administration, noted that some Connecticut communities fought off various planned highways in the 1970's and 1980's, from routes north through Fairfield County to a beltway around Hartford. 
 ''One of the factors to be kept in mind,'' he said, ''is that Connecticut was one of the more aggressive states in not building the interstate highway system.''

HEADLINE: With Few Exceptions, the String Remains the Same

BYLINE: By RON DICKER

 BODY:
In an era when scientists can land an unmanned spacecraft on Mars, no one has been able to quantify if a drop shot reacts better on kite string or piano wire. 
 Andrew Ashcroft, a doctoral student in engineering at the University of Cambridge in England, had an arsenal of data in his study of how the ball strikes the racket. His conclusion? ''We don't understand how the ball interacts with racket strings,'' he said. ''We can't correlate through mechanical tests what players perceive.'' 
 Players in a 15th-century version of tennis hit the ball with parchment stretched over their racket heads. Imagine swatting a ball with a cheap drum to understand why tennis players sought alternatives.
 In the 16th century, they turned to animal intestine, or gut, to construct the string of choice. Unless moving from sheep innards to cow innards can be considered progress, the evolution of tennis strings remains in slow-motion.
 Many of the elite players in the United States Open still play with gut. Synthetic materials like polyester may share the racket head with gut, but those, too, have been around for decades.
 ''String is not that big a deal to consumers,'' said Jay Schweid, who strings rackets for professional players. So companies, he said, will not pay for innovations. Nylon, Kevlar and polyester are used to make strings more durable, but gut has never gone out of style in the elite ranks. It is considered to have a softer feel, a greater cradling effect on the ball and more rebounding capacity, and it is supposed to be easier on the elbow.
 Schweid, whose clients include Andre Agassi, said too many variables -- racket angle, speed of the approaching ball, the player's arm speed, tension of the strings -- make it impossible for a machine to make precise calculations. It comes down to player intuition.
 ''At this level, they're artists, like pianists,'' Schweid said. ''Things they feel they can't explain.'' 
 Perhaps the one string attribute that could be measured throughout history was durability. When gut was at a premium during World War II because it was needed to stitch soldiers' wounds, sporting goods companies came up with a nylon alternative. The evidence that nylon lasted longer was overwhelming. The string became popular among recreational players.
 Nylon was the first profound advancement in the industry since string makers began turning to slaughterhouses. Crawford Lindsey, the co-author of ''The Physics and Technology of Tennis,'' called nylon the gold standard but does not recommend it for elite players. 
 Kevlar, which is used in bulletproof vests, and a more flexible polyester have made inroads in the elite ranks. Thirteen of the top 20 men, including No. 1-ranked Roger Federer, use polyester exclusively or in combination with gut, according to Lindsey. Agassi, an eight-time Grand Slam singles champion, once used Kevlar, which is supposed to create a truer ball strike because it is so rigid. 
 ''The stiffer the string bed, the less string will deflect, so the ball will come off the racket at a more precise angle,'' Lindsey said.
 But Agassi abandoned Kevlar because it contributed to a chronic wrist problem, Schweid said. Now Kevlar and polymer blends are mostly the domain of cost-conscious duffers. Steve Crandall, a spokesman for the polymer and Kevlar string maker Ashaway, said some lower-ranked pros use the stiffer synthetics because they cannot afford to replace gut often. 
 The percentage of upper-echelon women using synthetics is somewhat lower than the percentage of men. Nine of the top 20 women have some polyester in their racket head. Many players order rackets stitched with a synthetic on the main, or vertical, strings, and gut on the horizontal strings. They believe they are getting a blend of power and control, and less vibration to decrease the chance of injury.
 Much of the evidence is anecdotal. Schweid, acting on the reports he collects from players at tournaments around the world, recommends that his clients use a hybrid string design. Lindsey has conducted tests on more than 350 strings on a pendulum-like device at his Racquet Sports Industry office in Vista, Calif.
 ''There's no good, there's no bad,'' he said. ''Everybody has their personal opinion.'' 
 Sometimes, the proof is in the viewing. Ilie Nastase took the court against Guillermo Vilas in a 1977 match with a so-called ''spaghetti string'' racket made of nonintersecting strings on independent planes. It looked like a laughable novelty before Nastase began imparting wild spins on the ball. Vilas quit in disgust, ending his 50-match winning streak. The International Tennis Federation banned the string formation the following year. Nastase's bold stroke had threatened revolutionary change, but the sport's governing body would not allow it.
 Tennis seems to have treated the development of raw materials with the same wary eye. Pierre Babolat made what is believed to be the first mass-produced gut string in 1875, and the process has changed little since. The beef industry gets the meaty parts of the cow, and the tennis and medical industries share the part of the membrane called the serosa, which is dried, chemically treated and woven into strands.
 (Cat gut, as players often refer to it, has never been made of actual cat gut. One theory on how it received that name was that troubadours from ancient England used a string instrument called a kit. The strings were known as kit gut, and that eventually became cat gut.)
 Three cows are required for one racket. Even less economical was sheep intestine. Once commonly used, sheep intestine went out of vogue because its strands were not long enough, and string makers perhaps found themselves in direct competition with sausage makers, who used the membrane for their casings.
 Professional and recreational players are unlikely to see major developments in string technology any time soon. 
 ''I don't think you'll see anything too radical over the next few years,'' Schweid said.

HEADLINE: Voices Of Dissent Heard as One

 BODY:
Photographs taken from above yesterday may have suggested a single strand of protesters along Seventh Avenue, antlike in their ability to move methodically as one. 
 But of course, within the colorful mass were tens of thousands of individuals: mothers with peace signs unused since the 1970's; businessmen angry about the economy; college students with dreadlocks, screaming and banging drums.
 Some came from nearby. Others spoke with accents of foreign cities only recently left behind.
 To capture all the voices would be impossible. Beyond the basic tenet -- that President Bush should be defeated in November -- each protester had an individual story of dissent, of political awakening. Here is a sample from the day.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Russia Still Dominate Arms Market, but World Total Falls

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
The United States and Russia continued to dominate the global arms market last year, especially when measured in weapons deals to developing nations, although the total value of arms sales worldwide tumbled for the third consecutive year, according to a new Congressional study.
 The United States maintained its lead in worldwide weapons sales in 2003, signing deals worth more than $14.5 billion, or 56.7 percent of all arms agreements, up from $13.6 billion in 2002, the study showed.
 Russia ranked second, signing agreements worth $4.3 billion, or 16.8 percent of all global arms sales deals in 2003. That figure was down from nearly $6 billion in 2002. 
 Germany was the third largest merchant in the global arms market for 2003, signing deals worth $1.4 billion. 
 The report, ''Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations,'' is published each year by the Congressional Research Service, part of the Library of Congress. The unclassified study is considered the most authoritative compilation of statistics on global sales of conventional weapons that is available to the public.
 The study, nearly 90 pages of statistics and analysis, offers glimpses into the speculative and secret world of missile proliferation by North Korea.
 Between 1996 and 1999, no surface-to-surface missiles were delivered to developing nations by the United States, Russia, China or European arms manufacturers. But 30 such missiles were delivered during that period by a state classified by the report as ''Other,'' a category that includes North Korea, Israel and South Africa. Between 2000 and 2003, 20 more surface-to-surface missiles were delivered by the nations in that category, according to the study.
 Although the report does not identify the country that manufactured and delivered the weapons, Pentagon analysts say the missile proliferation statistics almost certainly refer to North Korea.
 Of those 50 missiles, 10 were delivered in Asia, and 40 to the Middle East. The report does not identify the recipients of the missiles.
 According to the study, the value of all weapons transfer agreements worldwide was more than $25.6 billion in 2003, the third consecutive year that the dollar total for global arms deals declined. When measured in dollars adjusted for inflation to give an accurate comparison to the $25.6 billion figure, the value of global arms agreements has steadily fallen, from $41 billion in 2000.
 ''Nonetheless, the developing world continues to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by conventional weapons suppliers,'' Richard F. Grimmett, a specialist in national defense at the research service, wrote in his introduction to the study.
 In 2003, arms transfer agreements to developing countries topped $13.7 billion, or 53.6 percent of all weapons deals worldwide. This was a notable decrease from the $17.4 billion total in 2002.
 Of those arms deals with developing countries, the United States signed deals for more than $6.2 billion, or about 45.4 percent, while Russia signed for $3.9 billion, or 23.4 percent of the sales in 2003.
 Mr. Grimmett's research found that ''numerous developing nations have reduced their weapons purchases primarily due to their lack of sufficient funds to pay for such weaponry,'' according to the study. ''Even those prospective arms purchasers in the developing world with significant financial assets have exercised restraint and caution before embarking upon new and costly weapons procurement endeavors,'' he wrote.
 What Mr. Grimmett termed ''the unsettled state of the global economy'' prompted a number of developing nations to focus on upgrading their existing arsenals rather than signing deals to purchase new weapons systems.
 Fewer large-scale arms purchases were being made by the wealthier oil nations in the Middle East, whose earlier buying sprees contributed to a bull market in weapons when Iraq under Saddam Hussein was a regional threat. The report said it remained uncertain whether the Persian Gulf states would now perceive a potentially hostile Iran as a new motivation to improve their arsenals.
 Some relatively large arms purchases were made by developing nations in Asia, according to the report. 
 Between 2000 and 2003, China signed arms deals to acquire $9.3 billion in weapons. After China, the nations that signed the highest-value weapons deals during that period were, in order, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, India, Israel, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Singapore and Kuwait, according to the report.
 Evidence of the missile trade outlined in the study came into public view in December 2002, when a North Korean cargo ship was halted and boarded off the Horn of Africa by crews from two Spanish warships. Fifteen Scud missiles were found hidden in the hold. But the ship and its cargo were allowed to sail on to Yemen when officials determined that no treaties had been violated.
 North Korea has a long record of aiding both Iran and Pakistan with their missile programs, according to American government officials.

HEADLINE: A Nike Veteran Adds Some Swoosh to Disney's Tired Mouse

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Calif. Aug. 29 

 BODY:
''Never underestimate the power of a free T-shirt,'' Andrew P. Mooney, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company's consumer products division, joked as bikini-clad sunbathers dove into a pool at The Standard hotel here last week. 
 Mr. Mooney was quoting Philip H. Knight, the charismatic founder of Nike, with whom Mr. Mooney worked for 20 years. But he was referring specifically to a promotion he spearheaded in 2001, hoping to get celebrities like Jennifer Garner and Sarah Jessica Parker to wear Mickey Mouse T-shirts and give the character a more contemporary appeal. 
 It was a hit. Retail sales of the retro T-shirts have doubled annually since their introduction, and Dolce & Gabbana has designed a $1,400 sequined Minnie Mouse T-shirt, to be in stores this fall. 
 Mr. Mooney shook his head and laughed. ''Who would have thought?'' he said.
 It was the kind of ''out of the ordinary'' thinking that Disney needed, he said, to revive its consumer products division, which had been eroding since its peak in 1997. 
 The consumer products division provides only a small part of Disney's overall revenue, about 9 percent. But toys, costumes and backpacks have a life far beyond the movie theater. And Mr. Mooney hopes to turn Mickey and company into the Martha Stewart of bed, books and apparel for children, trading as much on Disney's reputation for quality (a draw for parents) as on its characters' appeal. 
 In effect, analysts said, he is trying to do for Disney's consumer products business what Mr. Knight did for Nike: turn the Disney name into a lifestyle brand.
 Since 1999, when Mr. Mooney joined Disney, the publishing group has inaugurated its first original comic book series -- W.I.T.C.H., a collection of stories about teenage girls with supernatural powers. The series sells well worldwide, and is being developed as a television show for Disney's cable networks. Mr. Mooney and his team made being a princess both hip and profitable: the Disney Princess line of costumes and accessories will earn $2 billion this year in retail sales and spawned a series of princess-related events at Disney's theme parks.
 ''For the first time there seems like there is a coherent plan,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''We'll see how it works, but so far the results under his tenure are good.''
 Not every new idea is a hit, of course. A few years ago, Disney tried to market, under the Always Fresh label, women's nightshirts and T-shirts, including one depicting a suggestively posed Snow White and the phrase, ''Attracts Strange Little Men.'' Reminded of the unsuccessful venture, Mr. Mooney groaned. ''We were young,'' he said, adding, ''You have to undergo a degree of chance if you want to succeed.''
 And Mr. Mooney admits he has a long way to go to turn around the division. In its heyday in 1997, the consumer products division had $893 million in operating income and more than 4,200 licensees who sold products related largely to Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse, as well as the company's popular animated movies, like ''Snow White'' and ''The Lion King.'' The company had 749 Disney Stores worldwide.
 But when the retail market declined, so did profits. Disney Stores had expanded into second- and third-tier malls, and those stores quickly showed losses as the economy sputtered. The quality of Disney-branded products was suffering as well; the Disney name could be found on almost anything. By 2000, operating income had dwindled to $386 million and even Mickey Mouse's popularity was showing wear. 
 Mr. Mooney, 49, had his work cut out for him. First, he halved the number of licensees. Then he began actively pursuing companies Disney wanted to work with, rather than waiting for them to call, as his predecessors had done. He also began selling Disney's underperforming stores and seeking high-end retailers like Fred Segal in Los Angeles to sell specialty products. Most important, he strengthened Disney's relationship with large retailers; the division opened a sales office in Bentonville, Ark., where Wal-Mart, the country's biggest and most influential mass retailer, is based.
 Now, four years later, the consumer products division earned $388 million in operating income in the first three quarters of 2004, which already puts it ahead of 2003. Industry analysts predict that operating income could reach $511 million for the fiscal year. Further, Disney has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to sell its more than 300 stores in the United States to The Children's Place retail chain. 
 ''It's kind of been 'show me the money' time,'' Mr. Mooney said.
 One of Mr. Mooney's major initiatives is to expand into clothing and household goods like bed linens that will rely on the Disney reputation, but not Disney characters. Next spring, the company plans to introduce, under the Disney Denim brand, pants and jean jackets that have whimsical elements like pocket fabric inspired by cartoon strips.
 Parents who do not want to dress their children in head-to-toe Mickey Mouse can mix and match, Mr. Mooney said. Retailers also receive a break, paying a royalty fee of 5 percent on Disney Denim instead of the 10 percent they usually pay to sell apparel with Disney characters. Mr. Mooney hopes to expand the offering into linens and other household products.
 But lifestyle products with an untraditional flair are what seem to excite Mr. Mooney most. At Fred Segal in Los Angeles, Disney recently tested Snap watches, which have interchangeable faces and wristbands and are based on Disney characters but with a hipper, more urban appeal. In his interview at the hotel, Mr. Mooney held up a pink T-shirt from the Disney Cuties line for young girls and teenagers, introduced 15 months ago. The shirt was printed with a blue and white Eeyore outlined in thick black lines, more anime-style than conventional Disney animation. 
 ''This is Japanese anime meets the library,'' said Mr. Mooney, a grin sliding across his face. ''We started in T-shirts and now we're making pillows and cellphone cases. We are always looking for sustainable ideas that cross all lines of business.''
 Mr. Mooney's strategy is dependent on consumer spending, of course, and teenagers are among the most capricious shoppers. Revenues also come from merchandise based on animated movies created by Disney's joint partner, Pixar Animation Studios, will end, too, if the relationship ends, as expected, in two years.
 Mr. Mooney said the shelf life of trend-driven products was six months to two years, and could be tracked through four urban centers: first Tokyo, then London, New York City and Orange County, Calif. At Zakka shops in Tokyo, which sell pop culture items, Mr. Mooney said Winnie the Pooh was a hot seller among teens last year. Since then, Pooh has been replaced by Marie, the mischievous gray kitten from the animated film ''The Aristocats,'' and, more recently, Alice in Wonderland. 
 Disney's most successful new product to date is the Disney Princess line of dresses, tiaras and dolls. The idea was quite simple: bring together the most popular female animated characters, like Snow White, Jasmine (from ''Aladdin'') and Cinderella, and sell them as a group with their own costumes and accessories.
 Now princess-themed breakfasts at the Disney resorts, which began in 2002, sell out months in advance. The success of the Disney Princess line inspired a new Disney Fairies line (led, of course, by Tinkerbell), which will include books and a direct-to-video movie. And, in Japan, 20,000 mothers and daughters this year paid $150 each to attend seminars where they learned to drink tea like, well, princesses.
 ''We've opened the creative sandbox,'' Mr. Mooney said.
 He said the consumer products business was growing faster outside the United States, and products were being introduced in Japan or Europe well before they hit American shores. That was the case with Disney's new W.I.T.C.H. books, which chronicle the lives of five teenage girls who spend their days worrying about boys and friends and their nights fighting evil-doers. (The initials stand for their first names.) 
 The comic books were introduced in Italy in 2001 and now sell a million copies worldwide each month. The first W.I.T.C.H. book was introduced as a graphic novel in the United States in June this year. It has already sold 650,000 copies, Mr. Mooney said.
 Next year, Disney plans to air a W.I.T.C.H. animated television show both in Europe and in the United States on the company's cable stations. The company also recently released in Italy its first issue of another comic book, ''Kylion,'' the story of a group of space-traveling children who land on a strange planet and must survive there. While there are no plans yet to develop the property for television, Mr. Mooney said his team had been working with the television group to develop adaptable plot lines.
 And perhaps Ms. Garner and Ms. Parker will soon be photographed wearing W.I.T.C.H. T-shirts or carrying Kylion purses. ''Who knows?'' said Mr. Mooney, laughing.

HEADLINE: Can Microsoft Stomp iTunes With a Store Of Its Own?

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
When Microsoft unveils its online music store later this week, the first song offered should be Dave Brubeck's ''It's Deja Vu All Over Again.'' For Microsoft, taking a trail blazed by others -- then trying to dominate the market -- is a familiar tune. 
 With the opening on Thursday, Microsoft will land itself in a market that Apple Computer pioneered more than a year ago with its iTunes online music store, in much the same way that it took on Netscape in the Web browser business and Sony in the market for console game machines. As a storefront on the MSN online service, Microsoft's music service will offer song tracks for downloading to personal computers and portable music players. 
 Granted, the market for online music today is tiny, accounting for less than 2 percent of all music sales in the United States. Even five years from now, online sales are expected to account for 12 percent of a $1.7 billion domestic market. 
 ''For Microsoft, it's like Slate, not Xbox,'' said David Card, research director of Jupiter Research, referring to Microsoft's foray into online magazine publishing, which is considered a tiny business within the company. ''It's a pretty small opportunity right now.''
 But music is only part of Microsoft's strategy. The company has timed the store opening with the release of a new version of Windows Media, the software that allows consumers to play movies, songs and other content on a variety of devices running the Windows operating system. With Windows Media and the online music store, Microsoft hopes to further its efforts to make Windows a foundation for its reach beyond the desktop and into the living room.
 The launch also comes as MSN is finally turning the corner. The service has begun making a profit for the first time, after losing money consistently since it was introduced as the Microsoft Network in 1995. For the fiscal year that ended in June, the unit posted an operating profit of roughly $200 million, compared with a loss of about $531 million last year.
 But regardless of MSN's success, Microsoft will face a strong competitor in the online music market. In 16 months, Apple has managed to capture almost 70 percent of the market for digital music downloads, according to Forrester Research. And iTunes has helped Apple sell its iPod, the portable music player compatible with iTunes. Last month the company announced it had sold its hundred-millionth song -- a milestone that did not come as quickly as the company had originally projected.
 The rest of the market for online music downloads is shared by Sony, RealNetworks, Napster from Roxio, MusicMatch, the Wal-Mart Stores Web site and a long list of others, ''all fighting for the scraps that Apple has left behind,'' said Josh Bernoff, a market research analyst at Forrester. Yahoo, Virgin Records and MTV, a Viacom unit, are all expected to join the fray within the next few months.
 Given how fragmented the market is, MSN's eight million subscribers could quickly allow Microsoft to grab second place, Mr. Bernoff said. That spot has been held for the last few weeks by RealNetworks, a longtime Microsoft adversary that has both a music download store and a subscription-based streaming music service. 
 Earlier this month, in anticipation of Microsoft's new store, RealNetworks cut the price of its downloads in half, to 49 cents a song, and as a result sold more than a million songs the first week, compared with about 200,000 a week in July. Analysts expect Microsoft to sell its songs for something close to Apple's 99 cents. 
 Microsoft's service is expected to offer largely the same song selection as the other music services, though its collection is expected to be somewhat smaller than iTunes' at first. Record labels and artists have already learned there is little value in long-term exclusive distribution deals with a particular online service, but rather an advantage to striking smaller, special deals with each one.
 In Microsoft's case, industry observers say the company could announce a high-profile, short-term alliance as a way of raising its visibility. The industry has been wondering which online service will be the first to distribute the Beatles catalog, but analysts say Microsoft is not likely to announce such a deal.
 ''Microsoft is going to have to do something to get people's attention,'' Mr. Bernoff said.
 One way Microsoft will do that is by promoting the fact that song files from its service can be played on a wide range of portable music players, in contrast to iTunes, which works only with the iPod. 
 In a broad marketing campaign in conjunction with the debut of the new version of Windows Media and the music service, Microsoft is using the slogan ''Plays for Sure,'' a not-so-veiled dig at Apple's more proprietary approach. That follows RealNetworks' announcement last month that it had developed technology that allows users of its online music services to download songs to iPods, a move that riled Apple and led it to threaten legal action.
 On Friday, Hewlett-Packard announced its own Apple-authorized version of the iPod, which could further spur sales at the iTunes store. The Hewlett-Packard model sports the H.-P. logo but is otherwise virtually identical to Apple's model.
 While Microsoft's debut is likely to be strong, the long-term success of the service will depend on how good it is, analysts say. Mr. Card of Jupiter points out that despite Microsoft's considerable resources, the company has stumbled badly in several parts of the Internet market, and it may not have it any easier in the online music business. 
 ''It's not a slam dunk,'' he said. ''They have a lot of traffic and they know how to drive it where they want it to go, but they have to execute.''

HEADLINE: Tax Ruling Casts A Long Shadow

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
In the end, the Nobel prizes, doctoral degrees and dizzying financial transactions could not obscure what Long-Term Capital Management was doing, according to a court ruling on Friday. And that, the judge said, was dodging taxes.
 Still, leading tax lawyers, economists and tax executives who digested the decision over the weekend are focusing less on why Long-Term Capital's brainpower chose to skirt the law and more on what the decision means for future cases. 
 The judge, Janet Bond Arterton of Federal District Court in New Haven, ruled in a civil action that Long-Term Capital, the huge hedge fund that collapsed in 1998, acted in bad faith for the two years before its meltdown, when it took $106 million in tax deductions to avoid paying $40 million in taxes.
 The decision, which follows a yearlong trial, is thought to be the most significant test case yet of how the Internal Revenue Service will combat sophisticated tax avoidance schemes. The I.R.S. moves on to a civil action against Black & Decker, scheduled to go to trial this fall, according to a senior lawyer in Washington. Black & Decker has sued the government, claiming it is owed a refund of $57 million plus interest on taxes it already paid. The government claims the company engaged in an abusive tax shelter from 1995 to 2000 and owes more taxes plus penalties. 
 Timothy J. McCormally, executive director for the Tax Executives Institute in Washington, said in an e-mail message yesterday that the Long-Term Capital decision ''cannot help but give taxpayers and their advisers pause by underscoring the potency of the tools the I.R.S. has (and has had all along) to attack suspect transactions.''
 Judge Arterton upheld two large penalties against Long-Term Capital, which is defunct -- one totaling 20 percent of its $40 million tax bill, the other 40 percent. The larger number is expected to be the only one that applies, raising the amount the hedge fund owes to federal coffers to about $56 million. 
 The judge also wrote that the fund's partners could not claim that they were legally protected by favorable opinions that they had bought from two law firms, Shearman & Sterling and King & Spaulding, as blessings for the tax dodges. Such letters have been at the heart of the proliferation of tax shelters since the mid-1990's.
 Long-Term Capital's collapse, prompted by Russia's default on its sovereign debt, a big investment for the fund, sent tremors through global markets and prompted a $3.6 billion bailout from Wall Street banks, many of which had invested in the fund.
 Long-Term Capital paid part of its tax bill after an audit, but sued the government in 2001 to demand a refund, claiming that it could prove the transactions in question were legitimate even though it knew they were not. The judge noted that Myron S. Scholes, one of the firm's founders and a 1997 winner of the Nobel in economic science, had internally described one transaction as essentially a government handout. 
 ''If we are careful, most likely we will never have to pay long-term capital gains on this 'loan' from the government,'' Dr. Scholes wrote in a 1996 memorandum cited in the ruling. 
 Over the weekend, in e-mail responses to written questions, Dr. Scholes said that ''the law firms gave strong opinions.''
 ''Without this advice and opinions we would not have gone forward with the transactions,'' he wrote.
 One lawyer who asked not to be identified said Long-Term Capital's partners might sue the two law firms. Dr. Scholes declined to comment on that issue.
 Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel economist, who testified against Long-Term Capital, said, ''The opinion letters were supposed to be insurance'' that the transactions would stand up in the eyes of the I.R.S.
 ''I think they hoped that with an opinion letter, the I.R.S. wouldn't impose penalties,'' Mr. Stiglitz said.
 Larry Langdon, a former senior lawyer at the Internal Revenue Service who is now in private practice at Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw in Palo Alto, Calif., said Judge Arterton's decision signaled a new chapter in the war on tax cheats. Mayer, Brown represented the government in its case against Long-Term Capital.
 Until now, Mr. Langdon said, ''the government has not aggressively used their imposition of penalties as a way of curtailing abusive transactions.''
 On Friday, Eileen O'Connor, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's tax division, praised the ruling, saying that it ''confirms that transactions entered into merely to shelter income from taxes will be disregarded for tax purposes and that unreasonable legal opinions will not protect investors from monetary penalties.''
 Because Long-Term Capital was a partnership, the fund's 12 partners are liable for the total tax bill, which is calculated according to their individual stakes in the fund. The I.R.S. could even foreclose on partners' houses and other assets to raise money to pay the bill.
 In his e-mail messages over the weekend, Dr. Scholes said he disagreed with the ruling. He added: ''I paid my share of the penalty as well as the tax. Therefore, I don't have additional tax to pay.''
 Dr. Scholes, the author of a textbook called ''Taxes and Business Strategy'' and now a partner at Oak Hill Capital Management, an investment firm in Port Chester, N.Y., played a central role in the tax deductions, and personally reaped millions of dollars from them, according to the ruling. Long-Term Capital's other founders were John W. Merriwether, the bond trader, and Robert C. Merton, who shared the 1997 Nobel with Dr. Scholes.
 None of the institutional investors or wealthy individuals who invested in the fund during its five-year run from 1994 to 1998 are in trouble with the I.R.S. for having done so. That is because the benefits of the tax dodges went to Long-Term Capital's partners, not to its outside investors.
 Long-Term Capital, which began operations in 1994 and two years later had more than $6 billion in assets, earned double-digit returns before its implosion. The fund partners each shared in the fees paid by outside investors: a 2 percent management fee and a 25 percent incentive fee based on gross profits in excess of the management fee.
 Judge Arterton's decision also questioned whether Long-Term Capital was actually bankrupt when it was bailed out by the banks.
 By July 2001, it reported a negative net worth of $60 million. But the ruling said that the firm was owed $104 million in fees, which would have given it a net worth of $44 million.
 Asked over the weekend if it is legitimate to exploit loopholes for gain, Dr. Scholes replied in an e-mail message: ''No, it is not. And, it is costly to do so. But, sometimes what is thought to be ethical in one time period, is deemed not to be so later on.''
 He added that ''with 20/20 hindsight, I would not have argued for undertaking the OTC/LTCM transactions,'' one of the core transactions dissected by Judge Arterton as an illegitimate tax dodge. 
 ''The political landscape is much different now with regard to tax planning strategies of any type,'' he said, ''than it was in 1996 when the transactions were undertaken.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 31, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article in Business Day yesterday about the implications of a tax ruling against Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that collapsed in 1998, referred incorrectly to the lawyers who prosecuted the case. They worked for the government, not for the law firm of Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw.

HEADLINE: Airlines Again Sell the Experience of Flying

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER; International Herald Tribune

 BODY:
For the world's airlines, the last three years have been a long nightmare. Buffeted by the continuing fallout from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a sluggish global economy and price competition from upstarts, established airlines are facing unusually intense financial pressures.
 Needless to say, it has not been a great time for advertising. Many airlines have sharply cut spending. 
 With their remaining budgets, airlines have generally turned away from traditional ''image'' ads extolling the quality of their service or that warm and contented feeling of their passengers. Instead, they have focused on price, or specific features like the angle of recline on a business-class seat.
 But as air travel picks up a bit, a few full-service airlines are once again trying the image approach. The campaigns seek to distinguish the major airlines from their low-fare rivals, while conveying a sense of security to nervous post-Sept. 11 travelers.
 Last spring, United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, introduced an unusual, animated television ad campaign by Fallon Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe. It used the voice of Robert Redford and said, ''It's time to fly.'' Several Asian airlines have also stepped up their use of image campaigns as long-haul traffic rebounds.
 And last week, Lufthansa introduced new advertisements that take what Harald Eisenaecher, vice president for marketing, called an emotional approach. That is a departure for Lufthansa, whose recent ads have highlighted fares and services like Flynet, the carrier's airborne Internet access.
 ''During the crisis years, we couldn't focus so much on quality and differentiation,'' he said. ''But those are very important elements for a network carrier.''
 The campaign, created by the Berlin affiliate of the Interpublic Group of Companies' McCann-Erickson agency network, will include print, online and outdoor ads, as well as direct marketing. It employs simple images that are easily adaptable for more than 40 markets.
 One print ad shows a sleeping couple aboard a plane. Beneath the Lufthansa logo, clearly visible on the seat back, the ad reads: ''Pilots who are perfectly trained. Mechanics who double-check every bolt. Flight attendants who leave you in a land of dreams. All for this one moment.''
 The ads include the company's previous slogan, ''There's no better way to fly.''
 ''Customers are very much the focus, not aircraft metal or speed or something,'' Mr. Eisenaecher said.
 Media spending is being managed by WPP Group's MindShare unit. In euros, Mr. Eisenaecher said, it comes to the ''low double-digit millions.'' That will bring Lufthansa back to roughly pre-Sept. 11 spending levels, he added. Like other carriers, it had cut back sharply. 
 In the United States alone, airline ad spending fell to $678 million last year, from $2.4 billion in 2000, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, an industry research firm. In the first six months of the year, it reached $375 million.
 Another major European airline, British Airways, which introduced its first brand campaign in about four years in the spring, was forced to pull the ads from television and radio last week amid service disruptions at Heathrow Airport in London. Dozens of flights were canceled because of a shortage of ground staff, leaving thousands of people stranded.
 Apparently, images of a businessman being flown by British Airways to meet his family on vacation -- backed by orchestral music and the tagline ''the way to fly'' -- did not blend well with television news reports of angry travelers.
 ''We did defer some of the ads but will reinstate them shortly,'' a British Airways spokeswoman said.

HEADLINE: A Party for All of Us

BYLINE: By Edward W. Brooke. 
Edward W. Brooke, the first African-American elected to the United States Senate by popular vote, represented Massachusetts from 1967 to 1979. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in June.

DATELINE: Warrenton, Va. 

 BODY:
As the Republicans gather this week in New York, I find myself thinking back to the first Republican National Convention I attended, 40 years ago, at which Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona received the presidential nomination. At the time I was the attorney general of Massachusetts and opposed the rise of Goldwater conservatism, aligning myself with many national party leaders. I supported Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York for the nomination and, after he withdrew from the race, Gov. William Scranton of Pennsylvania.
 Despite our efforts, Senator Goldwater won the nomination, and in the general election proceeded to carry only his home state and five states in the South. It was a resounding defeat for his brand of ''conservatism,'' and it was devastating to the Republican Party at every level of government. 
 I see alarming parallels between that disastrous convention of 1964 and this week's convention, at which President Bush will be nominated again. Now as then, many of the candidate's advisers and supporters show signs of arrogance, self-righteousness and intolerance, and of losing touch with the basic values of the vast majority of Americans. This extremism shows itself in any number of ways: excesses committed by the Justice Department under the Patriot Act, unilateralism in international affairs, crude political tactics in the Senate that have produced legislative gridlock and made a mockery of that chamber's great tradition of bipartisanship.
 In foreign affairs, more and more Americans -- almost a majority now -- question the wisdom of the bloody and expensive war in Iraq, as the promise of democracy there is overwhelmed by the reality of chaos. Our party must not forget the pitiful spectacle of Lyndon Johnson, elected overwhelmingly over Goldwater in 1964, but forced out of office four years later because he persisted in an increasingly unpopular war. There is an urgent need for more candor about this war and for a specific plan to end it.
 At home, the issues are the same ones we have faced for decades: an unconscionable rise in poverty, the need for universal health care and safe and affordable housing, the failure of American education, the need for more jobs at living wages, and the continuing challenge of equal rights for all.
 I spent much of my political career unsuccessfully trying to bring black voters into the Republican Party. It was a difficult task, and it remains so. Understandably, black voters still see domestic policies that do little to advance their hopes for a better life for themselves and their children. They see black unemployment rates more than double those for whites. They also see too many young black men in jail and too few in college.
 Moreover, I fear that, as in 1964, they will see far too few black delegates at our convention. One reason Barry Goldwater failed so totally was that he and his advisers hoped that by opposing the civil rights movement -- or, less gently put, supporting racism -- they would sweep to victory both in the South and elsewhere in America. This strategy failed because it underestimated the decency of the American people. If our party writes off black votes in a cynical appeal to votes based on prejudice, it too will fail, both politically and morally.
 The same is true with the issue of same-sex marriage. A great many Americans oppose a constitutional ban on such marriages, and if our party ignores their opinion and caters to homophobia, it will once again be wrong -- morally and politically. There is a great need, too, for more tolerance on the difficult issue of abortion and more respect for those on both sides of the debate.
 Barry Goldwater's fate was sealed when, in his address to the 1964 convention, he defiantly endorsed ''extremism.'' Later, when I served in the Senate, I came to know Barry Goldwater and to count him a friend, but at the 1964 convention he was intoxicated by ideology -- and it led to disaster. Now as then, instead of alienating mainstream voters with radical views, our party must find common ground with them.
 I believe in the party of Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Reagan, and I want it to succeed. I devoutly hope our party will show America a more open mind and a more generous heart this week, and that President Bush will reflect this message in his acceptance speech to the nation.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P. Arrives, Putting Sept. 11 Into August

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and ROBIN TONER; Reporting for this article was contributed by Katherine Q. Seelye, Thomas Crampton, Winnie Hu, John Holl and Jess Wisloski.

 BODY:
Republican leaders said yesterday that they would repeatedly remind the nation of the Sept. 11 attacks as their convention opens in New York City today, beginning a week in which the party seeks to pivot to the center and seize on street demonstrations to portray Democrats as extremist.
 Party aides said the convention would begin with an elaborate tribute to Sept. 11 victims, with speeches by Senator John McCain and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, reminding voters of Mr. Bush's role in leading the nation after the attacks, which took place a couple of miles from Madison Square Garden, home of the convention.
 ''Winston Churchill saw the dangers of Hitler when his opponents and much of the press characterized him as a warmongering gadfly,'' Mr. Giuliani plans to say, according to excerpts from his speech released last night. ''George W. Bush sees world terrorism for the evil that it is, and he will remain consistent to the purpose of defeating it while working to make us ever safer at home.'' 
 Indeed, the Sept. 11 invocations began even before the convention opened, leaving little doubt of the prominent role the attack on New York will play at the first Republican convention ever held in this city. At a rally yesterday afternoon on Ellis Island, Vice President Dick Cheney recalled the president's visit to ground zero three days after the attack.
 ''They saw a man calm in crisis, comfortable with responsibility and determined to do everything to protect our people,'' he said.
 At the same time, responding to the sight of New York streets packed with protesters yesterday, Republican officials sought to connect the demonstrations to Democrats as part of a broader effort to paint Senator John Kerry as out of the mainstream. The Republican Party chairman, Ed Gillespie, noted to reporters that the legion of protesters included Peggy Kerry, Mr. Kerry's sister, who lives in New York and attended an abortion rights rally.
 And Mr. Bush's campaign communications director, Nicolle Devenish, said in an interview: ''Those who support the president are inside the Garden. Those who are opposed to the president's policies are protesting outside the Garden.''
 Their developments came on the eve of what party officials saw as a potentially tumultuous and politically complicated week. Mr. Bush seeks to accomplish a critical political goal -- broadening his appeal to the center -- against the backdrop of the biggest demonstrations in New York in 22 years and charges by some Democrats that he is trying to turn the tragedy of Sept. 11 to his political advantage.
 After months of cultivating his conservative base by pressing positions like his support for a constitutional amendment prohibiting gay marriage, Mr. Bush, his aides said, will use his speech accepting the Republican nomination on Thursday to present what they described as a second-term agenda focused on health care, retirement, education and economic security.
 Advisers said Mr. Bush would return to a theme of an ''ownership society'' that encourages Americans to take more responsibility for their retirement and health care needs, including the creation of private accounts in Social Security. Other Republicans said Mr. Bush was likely to offer some sort of tax simplification plan.
 In a development reminiscent of the way Democrats managed to paper over differences on the Iraq war, there was some evidence here that tensions between moderates and conservatives over issues like gay marriage and abortion were easing because of the desire of both wings to ensure Mr. Bush's re-election. 
 ''There are people who have some difficulties with Bush about the war, but they're not expressing them,'' said Phyllis Schlafly, a longtime conservative activist. ''You have some old-time Goldwater fiscal conservatives not happy with big spending, and you have a lot of people not happy with the immigration issue. But overriding all of that, the choice is Bush v. Kerry, and they want Bush.''
 Delegates arrived in New York on a hot and humid August day, expressing confidence in Mr. Bush's success and applauding him for using the stage of the city -- the site of the worst terrorist attack in the nation's history -- for a convention.
 ''We absolutely need to invoke Sept. 11 in the convention,'' said Richard Aguilar, a delegate from Minnesota. ''This election will determine how we fight a war on terror that began right here in this city.''
 That sentiment was echoed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who denied the suggestion by Democrats that the president was trying to exploit the tragedy for political gain.
 ''I don't know anybody that's trying to exploit 9/11,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Quite the contrary. Nine-eleven is one of the defining moments of our lives.''
 And Republicans dismissed any suggestion that they were out of line in making the attacks a central part of the campaign. Mr. Gillespie noted that the Democrats had held their own tribute to Sept. 11 victims at their convention in Boston last month; Republican officials counted 100 separate instances of the attacks' being raised at the Boston convention.
 ''It was right for the Democrats to talk about it there,'' Mr. Gillespie said. ''We will talk about it here; we will do with an understanding that it was an event that had an impact on all of us.''
 Polls show that perhaps Mr. Bush's greatest strength over Mr. Kerry is the perception that he is protecting the nation from terrorist attacks, a perception that was clearly shared by Republicans as they contemplated the race ahead.
 Faith Mercke, a delegate from Louisville, Ky., said: ''I think it needs to be emphasized in that there is still a real threat to this country and the rest of the world. It is an advantage because of their strong leadership during the crisis.''
 Mr. Bush is not planning to visit the World Trade Center site on this trip, aides said. But they said Laura Bush would talk about her husband's actions after Sept. 11 when she speaks in prime time on Tuesday. 
 And Mr. McCain will talk about the attacks in his speech today, according to excerpts from his planned remarks, released last night by the Republican Party.
 ''No American alive today will ever forget what happened on the morning of Sept. 11th,'' Mr. McCain said. ''That day was the moment when the hinge of history swung toward a new era.''
 Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani were chosen to speak in prime time as part of an orchestrated effort by the party to present its most moderate leaders to the widest possible audience.
 Democrats scoffed at that effort as a cosmetic makeover.
 ''The other party is about to convene here, putting its once-every-four-years compassionate face on,'' former President Bill Clinton said in a morning speech at Riverside Church, one of the city's more liberal congregations. ''When they go back to Washington, it's a different deal, run by right-wing Southerners in the House and the Senate and lobbying groups and their allies in the White House.''
 And Mr. Bush is certainly not neglecting his party's conservative base. The platform that will be presented to delegates for approval today gives social conservatives most of their top agenda items, including an abortion plank that calls for a total ban, the appointment of judges who oppose abortion, and strong language against gay marriage. 
 Some Republican moderates said the Bush forces were far too consumed with the right. 
 ''They're so frightened that evangelicals will stay home, when they ought to be frightened that ours will,'' said Ann Stone, chairwoman of Republicans for Choice.
 But Charles Black, a veteran Republican strategist and an informal adviser to the Bush campaign, said, ''I can't think of anyplace where he's taken himself out of the mainstream.''
 There were signs that the White House was not entirely successful in ending tensions between different wings of the party. A group of former Republican governors, senators and other public officials placed a full-page advertisement in today's issue of The New York Times urging the party to move to ''more mainstream'' positions on the environment, the deficit, embryonic stem cell research and cooperation with international allies.
 ''Come back to the mainstream,'' the ad declares. 
 At the same time, the liberal anti-Bush group MoveOn.org plans to begin a $3 million advertising campaign in swing states featuring Republicans who say they will vote for Mr. Kerry.
 Some delegates said they were pleased that Mr. Bush was moving to a broader agenda this week, though others said they were glad that Mr. Bush, if changing his emphasis a bit, was not abandoning his commitment to conservative issues.
 ''The president certainly has been preaching to the choir,'' said Brad Freeman, a delegate from Brentwood, Calif. ''People trust the candidate who goes for what he thinks is right, not the candidate who goes for what he thinks is right politically.''
 Barbara Alby, who is from Folsom, Calif., said: ''I don't think you will hear a lot about abortion or gay marriage in the next few days. Right now people care about security, Iraq and the economy.''

HEADLINE: Northeast Loses In Reshuffling Of Housing Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The Bush administration is replacing the nation's three-decade-old financing system for public housing with a new formula that will redistribute billions of dollars, chiefly from New York and other big, urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest to small, rural places in the South.
 The plans represent one of the most far-reaching changes in housing policy in decades, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development is still working out many of the details. But already, housing authorities in the Northeast, including New York City, Baltimore and upstate New York, are talking about the need to lay off security guards, close day care programs or charge tenants for snow removal, air-conditioning and other services. Agencies in the South and the West, meanwhile, say they may finally be able to pay for their public housing maintenance needs.
 Set to take effect in 2006, the new formula stems from the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 that was sponsored by former Representative Rick A. Lazio, Republican of Long Island, and signed by President Clinton. It mandated a new way of calculating the federal government's $3.6 billion annual budget for day-to-day housing operations, such as labor, maintenance, insurance and utilities. 
 The existing formula, which dates to 1975, essentially allows established agencies to receive lump-sum payments to run public housing projects with minimal documentation. The new formula for calculating federal subsidies is based on the actual expenses incurred by a housing agency, and it is twinned with a new carrot-and-stick philosophy requiring all agencies to meet new performance standards.
 Smaller housing authorities, especially in the South, have long complained that the old formula favors older housing authorities by paying them more than their actual expenses, while ignoring the growing costs of new agencies. A study by Harvard University last summer echoed those concerns, and recommended that the subsidy be reformulated to reflect housing costs better.
 In theory, at least, many agencies and housing groups welcome the overhaul as a fairer formula. But the reality of slicing up the subsidy pie has provoked visceral reactions among winning and losing housing authorities similar to those in voter redistricting: it all depends on whether they get more or less than they did before.
 About four-fifths of the nation's 3,100 or so public housing agencies are expected to gain money over the next two years, according to preliminary HUD data analyzed by the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. Dallas is scheduled to receive an extra $7.6 million, or a 70 percent increase. Hundreds of small agencies in the South, led by Texas and Florida, are poised to gain at least 50 percent.
 ''It's unbelievable -- I've got a smile on my face,'' said Kevin Cregan, executive director of the Broward County Housing Authority in Florida, when told by a reporter of a projected increase for his agency of 144 percent from about $700,000 to $1.8 million. He hopes to use the money to hire badly needed maintenance workers.
 But anticipated losers say the new formula is flawed and too draconian. The New York City Housing Authority says it could lose at least $35 million from its current subsidy of $759 million, a 5 percent decrease. Meanwhile, a necklace of struggling upstate cities, like Syracuse, Rochester and Niagara Falls, could lose more than a third of theirs.
 ''When this industry was started in the 30's and 40's, it was never thought to be that you had to make money -- it was all about finding people a decent place to live,'' said Frederick R. Murphy, executive director of the Syracuse Housing Authority. Faced with a cut of 34 percent, he may seek higher insurance contributions from union employees, among other actions.
 While the Bush administration did not initiate the push for a new formula, the result does comport with its broader goal of relying more on private-sector practices to revamp traditional housing policies.
 The most publicized housing battle this year has involved the administration's proposal this year to loosen the eligibility rules for the $14.4 billion Section 8 voucher program, the government's primary effort to help the poorest Americans find and pay for their own housing. The change could mean that families with higher incomes could receive vouchers, leaving those with lower incomes to fight for a smaller share of the pie.
 The debate over operating subsidies, by contrast, has been confined to a small group of public housing officials, beginning when Congress directed HUD in 1998 to determine a new formula for operating subsidies. A year later, after some reluctance on the department's part, Congress directed the department to hire the Harvard University Graduate School of Design to conduct the study, called the Public Housing Operating Cost Study.
 Directed by Gregory A. Byrne, former director of the Miami-Dade County Housing Authority, and James G. Stockard Jr., director of the school's Loeb Fellowship Program, the study recommended that HUD stop delivering a lump-sum subsidy to each authority. Instead, it advocated decentralized budgeting and management practices used in the private real estate industry.
 The study, commonly referred to as the Harvard cost study, also calculated each agency's projected new subsidy, using as a benchmark the cost of running private properties subsidized by HUD and insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
 Despite criticism from some agencies that the F.H.A. data was a poor parallel for public housing, HUD accepted the findings, then invited a couple of dozen housing authorities to massage the specifics. Those negotiations concluded in June, and the final details should be released soon.
 ''We believe it's a significant improvement over what we have currently,'' said Michael Liu, the department's assistant secretary for public and Indian housing.
 There are some clear winners. All but 12 of Texas' 353 housing authorities are slated for increases, for a statewide increase of $54.1 million, or 47 percent. In Florida, all but three of 81 housing authorities are projected to gain, too, for a statewide jump of $37.6 million, or 38 percent.
 Other gainers include Puerto Rico, Georgia and several agencies in Westchester and Long Island.
 In Wichita Falls, Tex., a city of 100,000 on the Oklahoma border, an increased subsidy of $1.1 million, or 158 percent, is likely to be used to shore up an aging infrastructure. It is only fair, said Richard E. Schneider, executive director of the Wichita Falls Housing Authority, since smaller authorities have long been accustomed to being overshadowed by heavyweights like New York.
 ''It's just like a guy who needs to lose five pounds,'' said Mr. Schneider, adding that he is a proud Brooklyn native. ''In all honesty, it would probably be good for them, as opposed to being anemic at the other end.''
 On the flip side, 608 authorities are projected to lose money, according to the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. Among the hardest-hit states are Nevada, with a 21 percent cut, and Alaska, with 75 percent. But of the individual authorities with annual subsidies of more than $1 million, 11 of the 24 biggest percentage losers are from New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
 In New York state, 45 of 84 authorities are slated to lose money, for a net loss of $30.7 million. New York City officials say that the formula ignores additional costs such as the 1998 law's requirement, now going into effect, that many tenants perform community service. They say the formula also does not recognize the economies-of-scale benefits that can come with centralized expenses for contract bids, maintenance and heating services for big public housing projects like those that dot New York City.
 But officials also see the merits of the new philosophy, and say that the negotiations with HUD were fair.
 ''Given that it could have been much worse, I think HUD did a decent job in coming up with an outcome we could live with,'' said Douglas Apple, the New York authority's general manager.
 Baltimore faces a shortfall of $6 million -- or 11 percent of its subsidy -- on top of a deficit of $11 million. So the housing authority may have to fire its entire police force, suspend job-training programs and stop delivering meals to seniors who cannot leave their homes, said Paul T. Graziano, executive director of the Housing Authority of Baltimore City, and commissioner of housing for the City of Baltimore.
 Even Mr. Byrne, the formula's architect, anticipates growing pains. But he believes that public housing will ultimately benefit.
 ''People initially said, 'How dare you go outside the public housing world? Public housing is public housing, and you don't understand how life is in there,''' said Mr. Byrne, now a housing consultant in Bethesda, Md. ''But we don't do residents any good if we don't manage the properties very well. I think this is true program reform.''

HEADLINE: FROM RUSSIA; A Movement In Tennis Rooted in Tolstoy And Kournikova

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
SEVERAL weeks ago, a Russian couple appeared at Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy in Bradenton, Fla., and dropped off their 9-year-old daughter for three lessons. Told that the youngster showed great promise, the parents decided to leave her for nine months, not even bothering to ask for a scholarship.
 ''That's the Russian mentality,'' Bollettieri said. ''They think if they can get here quick enough, they've got a chance. They keep coming at you, like the Russian army.''
 The United States Open begins today with 5 Russians ranked in the top 10 in the world by the Women's Tennis Association and 12 in the top 100. In a breakout year, Anastasia Myskina won the French Open and Maria Sharapova triumphed at Wimbledon, signaling an ascent with roots in Tolstoy, the fall of the Soviet Union, the Olympics, the glamour of Anna Kournikova and the weekend passion, if not nimbleness afoot, of the former Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
 ''I don't recall ever seeing such a dramatic onrush of players from one country rising to the top so quickly as the Russian brigade,'' said Larry Scott, the chief executive of the WTA.
 Tour officials see the benefit of nationalistic rivalries and a pipeline of Russians flowing with the oil of long-term success. The Russians are not so sure, noting that the top coaches in Moscow are aging, many facilities are substandard and lessons can be expensive, anywhere from $25 to $80 an hour in a fragile economy. In the Soviet days, the state picked up the tab and talented children were spotted and cultivated in a centralized system of sports schools.
 ''I like it before,'' said Raouza Islanova, a prominent Muscovite coach and the mother of Dinara Safina, who is ranked 41st, and of Marat Safin, the men's winner of the 2000 United States Open. ''Groups of children, not too much to pay, more children to find talent. Now a rich man brings one child. I don't know if there is talent or not.''
 Nor has Russia escaped the scourge of stage parents, said Elena Dementieva, a finalist at the French Open.
 ''Russian parents, they pushing too much the kids,'' Dementieva said last week at the Pilot Pen tournament in New Haven. ''They are getting tired, and at 18 they don't want to play anymore.''
 Still, undeniably, the Russians are coming. A number of the top players are daughters of coaches or have parents who were top athletes. The father of Nadia Petrova, who is ranked 14th, was a champion hammer thrower and her mother won a bronze medal in the 4x100-meter relay at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.
 Just how many Russian girls and women are now playing is a question that even the country's tennis federation cannot answer. A Scottish publication said recently that 11 million women between the ages of 12 and 26 participate in tennis. Russian players and coaches dismiss that estimate as wildly inflated, saying a more accurate estimate would be 3,000 to 5,000.
 ''Maybe that is everybody's nightmare because there are so many on Tour,'' Olga Morozova, who in 1974 became the first Russian woman to reach a Grand Slam final, said with a laugh.
 If mass success is a recent phenomenon in Russia, tennis is not. Tolstoy owned one of the first courts in the country, and included a lawn tennis scene in ''Anna Karenina,'' noted Bud Collins, the author of ''Total Tennis: The Ultimate Tennis Encyclopedia.'' In Soviet times, Lenin played tennis, and later, so did Vyacheslav Molotov, a foreign minister. ''Some of the wives played,'' Collins said. ''Officially, it was looked upon as a bourgeois sport, but the elite still played.''
 The first Soviet woman allowed to play abroad was Anna Dmitrieva, who finished second in the Wimbledon junior tournament in 1956, Collins said. Her appearance resulted from an earlier trip that the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made to London, according to a story that may or may not be true but is told with great relish by Morozova, a former coach of the Russian national team.
 ''During one of the parties, one of the reporters came to him and said, 'Why don't you have people in Wimbledon?''' Morozova said. ''He said, 'What is Wimbledon?'''
 Khrushchev was apprised that Wimbledon was the premier tennis tournament, and, according to Morozova, ''Next year, we have people at Wimbledon.''
 By 1962, the Soviet Union's men entered the Davis Cup, and by 1968, its women entered the Fed Cup. In 1974, Morozova reached the women's final at both the French Open and Wimbledon. Still, tennis remained underdeveloped in Russia, and Morozova said that financial restrictions meant that only four players -- two men and two women -- were allowed to travel outside the country.
 Islanova, the coach, remembers as a Soviet player that rackets were handed out before practice and collected after. Even now, she gets upset when her daughter, Safina, breaks a racket in anger, given how precious the equipment was in the Soviet Union.
 From the early 1950's, the Soviets grew pragmatic about Olympic women's sports as a propaganda tool, developing great track and field stars and gymnasts, but tennis was excluded from the Summer Games from 1928 through 1984. Finally, the sport was reintroduced at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, a development that, Morozova said, ''made tennis big in our country.''
 ''We got government money to help,'' she said. ''Everything changed.''
 Mikhail Gorbachev's era of glasnost and perestroika in the mid-1980's brought a new openness, and even room for public complaint that Soviet players were not allowed to keep their prize money. In 1989, Natalya Zvereva famously displayed her runner-up check of $24,000 at the Family Circle Cup and said, ''This is not money; it is paper,'' threatening never to play for her country again.
 On Christmas Day 1991, the flag bearing the hammer and sickle was lowered from the Kremlin, replaced by the red, white and blue Russian tricolor. While this signaled the death of the Soviet Union, it meant a rebirth for tennis.
 Yeltsin, the first democratically elected Russian president, was an avid player and fan. He appointed the country's Davis Cup captain, Shamil Tarpischev, as his personal coach and as the minister of sport. Tennis became a high priority, sponsorship money poured in and the world's top tournaments appeared nationwide on television. 
 ''He created a very positive background that drew attention and people and business and mass media to this sport,'' Aleksei Selivanenko, a vice president of the Russian tennis federation, said of Yeltsin. 
 Although her career has gone unfulfilled, Kournikova also hugely affected the development of Russian tennis, officials and players said. She reached No. 1 as a junior, advanced to the semifinals at Wimbledon and won two Grand Slams as a doubles player. She demonstrated the great possibilities of athletic achievement and an international lifestyle of wealth, superstardom and celebrity, said Scott, the chief executive of the WTA.
 ''Tennis was an opportunity for a better life, and it was very well advertised through Anna,'' said Anne Worcester, the director of the Pilot Pen tournament.
 Yet some Russians chafe at the stereotype that they are merely striking and leggy and blonde, wanting to be appreciated for their tennis, not merely their looks.
 ''There's nothing the same with me and her,'' Dementieva, the French Open finalist, said of Kournikova.
 Kournikova was not a role model for Russian girls, because she spent all her time training in the United States, Dementieva said. The same could be said of Sharapova, 17, who arrived in Florida at age 7. Other Russian players say they do not really know her, suggesting she is more American than Russian in a way that hints at displeasure. Sharapova's agent said he did not really want to involve Sharapova in a story about the arrival of Russian women's tennis.
 ''She wants to be an individual,'' Max Eisenbud, Sharapova's agent, said. ''Why talk about Dementieva and Myskina?''
 Despite the ego jockeying, Russian tennis players have sprung from a system of coaching and development in place at the end of the Soviet Union. Most of today's top players began their careers at sporting clubs in Moscow like Dynamo, CSKA and Spartak. In the Soviet days, Dynamo was sponsored by the KGB, CSKA by the Red Army and Spartak by trade unions.
 Modern tennis clubs are being built in Moscow: Valery, founded in 1998 as a children's academy, advertises 14 indoor courts and 14 outdoor courts. The Russian federation holds hundreds of youth tournaments yearly. Many professionals, though, leave to train in the United States or Spain, given the disrepair of courts at home and a desire for better coaching. Safina made an undulating motion with her hand to describe the clay courts at Spartak. Because it has no hardcourts, she must go elsewhere to train on that surface. It is a hardy player who learns how to play on cracked, bumpy courts, said Elena Bovina, who is ranked 27th in the world.
 ''We have a stronger mentality,'' she said.
 Perhaps that is why Sharapova's career, built on risk and determination, resonates so appealingly: She was spotted at a Moscow clinic by Martina Navratilova and flew to Miami at age 7 with her father, Yuri, who borrowed $700 or $800 from friends. 
 They arrived at the Miami airport with no one to meet them and took three buses to Bradenton, Fla., seeking the Bollettieri Academy. She spoke little English beyond ''cat'' and ''dog'' and was so skinny, Bollettieri said, ''if she turned sideways you didn't see her.''
 She survived for two years, sleeping on mattresses on the floor, while her father worked odd jobs before she got a scholarship to the Bollettieri Academy at 9. 
 She was serious and focused on tennis, ignored harsh treatment by older girls, won Wimbledon at 17 and signed a deal as a worldwide spokeswoman for Motorola that could be worth $6 million.
 ''I've never seen such mania over one player in my 23 years in the sport,'' said Worcester, the Pilot Pen tournament director.
 Sharapova, ranked seventh in the world, is being marketed as a worldly woman who loves to read and visit museums. But she is also a typical 17-year-old who says things like, ''The only reason I'm an iPod fan is because it comes in pink.'' As all prodigies do, she is learning that early success brings a burden of expectation. For now, as with other Russians, she appears voracious, fearless.
 ''I'm sure they are a lot more hungry to get me,'' Sharapova said of her opponents. ''But so am I. I love that challenge. When someone is hungry, I am starving.''

HEADLINE: Bush, in West Virginia, Says He Kept His Promise to Steel Industry

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WHEELING, W.Va., Aug. 29 

 BODY:
President Bush brought a message of economic optimism to steel country on Sunday, asserting that he had delivered on his promise to help the beleaguered steel industry and making a broader case that his policies were the best way to guide the economy through unsettled times.
 In a quick visit to the northwest corner of a state that he won in 2000 and that he is fighting hard to keep in his column this year, Mr. Bush said he had taken decisive action to help steelworkers and companies by imposing tariffs on some imported steel from March 2002 to December 2003. 
 ''I thought I needed to stand up for steel, and I did stand up for steel,'' Mr. Bush said at a rally that campaign officials said drew 10,000 people. ''I put in place safeguards to restore fairness to the market to help our steel folks adjust. And it worked.'' 
 Mr. Bush also offered a defense of his decision to invade Iraq, saying, ''America and the world are safer because Saddam Hussein sits in a prison cell.'' But he did not repeat a phrase that he used in an interview with Time magazine to describe his view of what led to the continued fighting in Iraq, ''catastrophic success.''
 By that, Mr. Bush told the magazine, he meant ''being so successful so fast that an enemy that should have surrendered or been done in escaped and lived to fight another day.'' 
 Senator John Kerry's campaign seized on Mr. Bush's phraseology -- a military term of art conveying what can happen when armies succeed swiftly -- to press its case that Mr. Bush had rushed into the war without planning for the costs, for the extent of the military power that would be needed and for what would come afterward.
 ''President Bush now says his Iraq policy is a catastrophic success,'' Senator John Edwards, Mr. Kerry's running mate, said in a statement. ''He's half right. It was catastrophic to rush to war without a plan to win the peace. It was catastrophic to ignore the warnings of the military leadership about the risks of an unstable postwar Iraq.''
 Speaking a day before the opening of the Republican National Convention in New York, Mr. Bush also made a more general pitch for his economic agenda, reflecting the vital political importance of the economy even in a campaign that has been dominated by national security issues and the fitness of the two candidates to be commander in chief.
 His message was aimed not only at West Virginia, but also at voters in other industrial swing states like neighboring Ohio and Pennsylvania, where job losses, foreign competition and the legacy of the long slide in American manufacturing strength have left Mr. Bush vulnerable among voters who would otherwise tend to support him on foreign policy and cultural issues like gun control.
 Emphasizing the positive, Mr. Bush said the national unemployment rate of 5.5 percent was below the average of each of the last three decades and that the economy had added 1.5 million new jobs over the last year. But there are still 1.1 million fewer nonfarm jobs in the United States than there were when Mr. Bush took office. 
 The president paired his upbeat assessment with a commitment to continue pushing for policies that he said would help employers and workers.
 Mr. Bush emphasized an issue he is likely to highlight in his acceptance speech to the convention on Thursday night: his proposal to add private investment accounts to Social Security. But he also ran through other components of his economic agenda, many of which fall into the category of traditional Republican business-friendly ideas, which Mr. Bush suggested were not only essential to keeping the United States competitive with the rest of the world but also to encouraging growth and creating jobs. They include reducing regulation, putting limits on lawsuits, pushing for expanded trade and allowing more domestic oil and gas drilling.
 Addressing coal mining, another issue of importance in West Virginia, Mr. Bush said he had proposed large increases in spending on clean-coal technology to help make coal a more attractive energy source. And he attacked Mr. Kerry, accusing him of flip-flopping on coal's importance as an energy source.
 ''All I'm asking you to do is tell your friends and neighbors, be careful of somebody whose position shifts in the wind,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Mr. Kerry's campaign shot back that Mr. Bush had underfinanced the clean-coal program. And Mr. Kerry's camp said it was Mr. Bush who was a flip-flopper, on the steel tariffs.
 ''Bush has played politics with the steel industry from day one, and his miscalculations have hurt steelworkers,'' a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, Phil Singer, said . ''First he said free trade should govern, then he imposed tariffs, but then he pulled the tariffs before the steel industry could recover.''
 The main steelworkers union in the Wheeling area, the Independent Steelworkers Union, has endorsed Mr. Kerry. But Mr. Bush made a point of meeting here with six members of the union who support him, including three Democrats.
 One of the Democrats, Rick Cassini, a shop steward at the ISG Weirton steelworks, introduced Mr. Bush to the crowd as a ''man of steel'' and ''the original promise keeper'' for having lived up to his pledge to help the industry.

HEADLINE: Cheney Tries to Stir Memories of Bush in Days After 9/11

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

 BODY:
No sooner had Vice President Dick Cheney stepped onto Ellis Island yesterday from Liberty IV, a tugboat assigned to the National Park Service, than he gestured to the shimmering skyline of Lower Manhattan and urged several hundred supporters to remember the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the precarious state of the nation's security now.
 ''In the weeks following the terrorist attacks on America, people in every part of the country, regardless of party, took great comfort and pride in the conduct and the character of our president,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''They saw a man calm in a crisis, comfortable with responsibility and determined to do everything necessary to protect our people.'' 
 Saying ''we all remember'' President Bush's visit to ground zero in the days after the attacks -- when he shouted through a bullhorn, ''I can hear you,'' to the gathered rescue workers, adding, ''The people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.''
 The Bush campaign came under fire when it ran a television advertisement early in the campaign showing an image of a flag-draped body being removed from the site. Relatives of Sept. 11 victims and opponents of Mr. Bush immediately accused Republicans of exploiting a national tragedy for political gain.
 Despite that harsh criticism, yesterday's rally seemed to indicate that the president's strategists will not be reluctant during the Republican National Convention this week to draw upon Sept. 11 to bolster Mr. Bush's campaign.
 Campaign officials described yesterday's short, perfunctory rally on Ellis Island's northeast lawn as Mr. Cheney's official entrance into New York, the day before the convention begins. 
 About 300 invited guests sweltered on the muggy, sun-baked lawn, far fewer than the number needed to fill the area cordoned off for the rally.
 No mention was made at the rally of the tens of thousands of protesters snaking their way through Manhattan as Mr. Cheney spoke. 
 The economy did not come up, either. The Democratic Party and its standard-bearer, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, also went unmentioned.
 Instead, every main speaker, including Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Representative Vito J. Fossella, hit the same two points, again and again, in their brief addresses.
 They said that Ellis Island represented the Republican Party's commitment to cultural diversity and that Lower Manhattan offered stark evidence of the need to continue Mr. Bush's antiterrorism policies.
 Their words were the first hint of what will probably be a central focus of this week's convention: reminding voters of the way they regarded Mr. Bush in the days immediately after the attacks, before doubts about the war in Iraq and other issues arose.
 It was not that the vice president and other speakers ignored Iraq -- it was mentioned regularly as one of several accomplishments by Mr. Bush -- but they seemed much more intent on reminding the audience of those days before Iraq and of a time when a defiant Mr. Bush reached the height of his first-term popularity as he declared war on terrorism.
 Mr. Giuliani spoke of ''the two towers and all the people we lost,'' and praised ''the leadership the president and vice president gave us during those difficult days.''
 Mr. Pataki borrowed a signature line from Mr. Kerry, that 2004 marks ''perhaps the most important election in our lifetime,'' as he motioned toward the sky over Lower Manhattan, once dominated by the twin towers. 
 ''We remember what we don't see,'' he said. ''The two towers that stood over this harbor and were a symbol of strength for this country.''
 Mr. Fossella was the most blunt. ''We need to get the terrorists before they get us,'' he said. ''President Bush is a leader who knows that his primary responsibility is to protect the American people and nothing else comes second.''
 Half an hour after it began, the rally was over, and Mr. Cheney shook hands as he made his way along the edge of the crowd that had sweltered on the shadeless lawn for nearly two hours before he and the other dignitaries arrived. 
 A few minutes later, Mr. Giuliani walked along the 200-yard, semi-circular American Immigration Wall of Honor that bears the names of millions of immigrants who had passed through Ellis Island. He said he was looking for the name of his grandfather, but then realized it was on the far side of the lawn, beyond the security perimeter. 
 But later, a tour of the wall showed there were 44 Giulianis, including a Rudolph, as well as 44 Bushes, nine Patakis, five Cheneys and one Fossella.
 ''There are those in this world who have set themselves against the freedoms that we enjoy,'' Mr. Cheney told the crowd earlier. ''They have attacked our nation and they wish to do us further harm. But with the leadership of this president and the resilience of the American people, we will meet the challenges of our time.''

HEADLINE: A Bush Backer Mixes Caution With Confidence

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Matthew Dowd, a former Democrat at the heart of President Bush's re-election campaign, has a favorite quotation from Yeats taped to his office wall: ''Being Irish, he had an abiding sense of tragedy which sustained him through temporary periods of joy.''
 The gloomy sentiment might help explain why Mr. Dowd, the Bush campaign's chief strategist who voted twice against the first President Bush, is predicting that Mr. Bush will get little or none of the traditional bounce in the polls after the Republican National Convention. 
 Mr. Dowd is of course playing the game of lowered expectations -- he went so far as to predict, wrongly, that Senator John Kerry would have a 15-point lead after the Democratic convention -- but some Republicans say his assessments have been so dire that he is conceding Mr. Bush's defeat. 
 Mr. Dowd dismisses the talk as pre-convention hysteria. ''There's this whole idea that somehow I'm predicting we're going to lose,'' he said in a recent interview at Bush campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va. ''Obviously, I'm saying what I think is going to happen. A big part is to prepare internally and for our troops, so that when this happens it's expected.''
 The important thing, he said, is equilibrium. ''Every time there's a great poll, I try to counsel people that this is not going to last,'' he said. ''I operate as if we're on the edge and need to do everything possible.''
 Which, he concluded, ''is where we are.''
 Mr. Dowd, a dispassionate and cerebral 43-year-old, should know. He oversees polling, research, focus groups, advertising, targeting of important counties and much of the Bush campaign message itself. It was the role that Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, played in the 2000 campaign, with Mr. Dowd as his pollster. 
 One of Mr. Dowd's most complex tasks is to manage the 10 advertising agencies and 5 polling firms that the most expensive re-election effort in American history has hired to try to ensure that Mr. Bush gets a second term. Polling is done weekly, Mr. Dowd said, but only in the 18 states that are considered competitive.
 ''We don't do any more national polls,'' he said. ''Because why waste interviews in places that you know you're going to either carry or lose? So what we do now is take the battleground states and just look at those as a whole and then we look at them individually.'' 
 Mr. Dowd also researches historical voting patterns to help Ken Mehlman, the campaign manager, decide where he should spend money and deploy troops. In Michigan, Mr. Dowd said, ''you look at the precincts in Oakland County you need to turn out well; then what comes out of that is phone banks or direct mail.''
 Mr. Rove, who oversees the campaign from the White House, says that his disciple has a ''bigger and broader'' job than he himself had in 2000. ''He has been a key part of every decision the campaign has made,'' Mr. Rove said in an interview.
 It was Mr. Dowd, Mr. Rove said, who recommended that the campaign begin its advertising extraordinarily early, in March, the day after John Kerry effectively won the Democratic nomination. ''His point was go heavier first, then trail off toward the summer,'' Mr. Rove said. The goal was to undo the battering that Mr. Bush had taken in the Democratic primaries and to define Mr. Kerry as a flip-flopper. 
 Still, after more than $90 million in advertising over five months, Mr. Bush is only neck and neck with Mr. Kerry, a result that Mr. Rove and Mr. Dowd insist is no cause for alarm.
 ''The president went from being 8 to 12 points down to basically even,'' Mr. Rove said, declaring himself ''enormously satisfied'' with Mr. Dowd's advertising strategy.
 One reason the White House values Mr. Dowd, who worked for Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas when he was Michael S. Dukakis' vice-presidential running mate in 1988, is his knowledge of the other side. ''He's never been judgmental about Democrats,'' said Michael D. McCurry, President Bill Clinton's press secretary, who did corporate work for Mr. Dowd's political consulting firm in 1999. ''When he sees what the Democrats are doing, he'll nod and say, 'O.K., I understand why they're doing that.'''
 Mr. Dowd's former life as a Democrat is only one thing that sets him apart from the suited-up young Republicans striding through the Bush campaign's corporate-like headquarters in an office park across the Potomac River from Washington. For the interview, Mr. Dowd was dressed in olive jeans and no tie, while holding an unlit cigar. 
 Gazing out his big picture window over the verdant suburban haze looking west, he pointed out, toward his home in Austin, Tex., and seemed less panic-stricken than others in the campaign about straying slightly off the morning's talking points.
 ''I think the way we lose is if somehow the economy turns down'' or if there is ''some huge undercutting on strength'' of how people view Mr. Bush in fighting terrorism, Mr. Dowd said. 
 Mr. Dowd, one of 11 children of a Detroit auto executive, makes no secret that he is more or less miserable in Washington, and is counting the days until November, when he can leave his rented house in Georgetown with his wife, Nikki, and their young daughter Josephine (Mr. Dowd also has three sons from an earlier marriage) to go back to Texas, where he is thinking about running for state comptroller. 
 ''We're moving back to Austin, that's one thing for sure, as quickly as we can pack up the house,'' Mr. Dowd said. If it turns into a reprise of the 2000 Florida recount, he said, ''I don't think I want to stay around. I think somebody else can be smart.'' 
 But aren't political campaigns supposed to be fun? ''Yeah, I'm sure it's fun, but it'll be fun when it's over,'' Mr. Dowd replied. ''I won't ever do it again for anybody else, I'll tell you that.''
 Mr. Dowd, who started his political life as a 13-year-old Nixon fan transfixed by the 1974 Watergate hearings (his parents were Republicans), said he became less enamored of the Republican Party at Newman College, a now-defunct private Catholic school in St. Louis. He credits Mr. Bush with converting him from conservative Democrat back to Republican when Mr. Dowd was working for Bob Bullock, the Democratic lieutenant governor of Texas who was close to Mr. Bush when he was governor. 
 Like Mark McKinnon, another former Democrat who is now the Bush campaign's media strategist, Mr. Dowd said he was drawn to Mr. Bush's performance as governor, particularly his record on education, and his personality. He joined Mr. Bush's first presidential campaign at the urging of Mr. Rove, whom he knew from Austin.
 If he had any difficulty switching parties, Mr. Dowd is not saying. ''I'm a pretty conservative person,'' he said by way of explanation, although he side-stepped a question posed in a later e-mail message about whether there were issues he dealt with in the Bush campaign that made him uncomfortable. 
 ''I believe very much in the president and what he stands for and where he wants to lead the country,'' Mr. Dowd wrote back.
 In many ways, Mr. Dowd is one of his own swing voters-- middle-class males from places like Marquette, Mich., who have traditionally voted Democratic but in his view are moving toward the Republicans.
 Mr. Dowd predicts that the numbers will bump around after Labor Day and then settle down with the two candidates four or five points apart after a final debate in late October. 
 ''Oh, we're going to win,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''I just don't know exactly what the margin is going to be.''

HEADLINE: Report Shows More Spending By Consumers

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Consumer spending emerged from a slump and rebounded sharply in July as households dipped aggressively into their pocketbooks after an unexpected spell of restraint in June, government figures showed yesterday.
 While the rebound bolstered hopes that the economy is recovering from its recent weakness, a sluggish rise in personal incomes in July stirred concerns that spending might fizzle again soon if businesses do not begin hiring substantially.
 ''Everything is very finely balanced,'' said Steven Ricchiuto, chief United States economist at ABN Amro. ''Anything can upset the apple cart at this point.'' 
 The Commerce Department reported that personal consumer spending grew 0.8 percent in July, bouncing back from a 0.2 percent decline in June, which was revised from a drop of 0.7 percent. 
 The easing of consumers' restraint is welcome news for the economy. In the spring, the fading stimulus from last year's tax cuts combined with higher gasoline prices and rising interest rates to curb spending. 
 That sudden stinginess contributed to a slowdown in the economy. In the first three months of the year, consumer spending contributed 2.9 percentage points to the overall growth rate of 4.5 percent. In the second quarter, by contrast, consumers contributed only 1.6 percentage points to a meager expansion of 2.8 percent. 
 The slowdown raised fears that the economy's main pillar of support was weakening. When employment growth slowed in June and ground to a virtual standstill in July, with only 38,000 new jobs recorded, several economists started wondering whether output was losing all its vigor. 
 But the recovery of consumer spending -- which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity -- has rekindled some faith in the economy's staying power. ''Spending is showing a much better pattern,'' said Michael J. Moran at Daiwa Securities.
 Sales of durable goods surged by 4.1 percent last month after a 3.2 percent decline in June. Nondurable goods and services grew moderately. ''July was a good month and we are running strong in August,'' said Scott Hartman, president of Rutter's Farm Stores, a chain of 51 convenience stores in south-central Pennsylvania.
 The new spring in consumers' stride was accompanied by further confirmation that rising oil prices did not set off a chain reaction of higher prices across the board. The price index of consumer purchases and the core index, which excludes food and energy, were both unchanged last month.
 While the latest data is not expected to deter the Federal Reserve from its campaign to raise interest rates, expectations are for a much more gradual path than was envisioned two months ago. And with crude oil prices starting to recede from their recent highs -- and gasoline prices substantially below their June peaks -- higher energy prices seem less of an economic threat. 
 Disappointing income figures did, however, cast a pall on the upbeat spending data. Even as American consumers confirmed the resilience of their purchasing habits, a muted rise in personal incomes renewed concerns that spending could fade again if there is not a substantial rise in jobs that could put some real money in people's pockets. 
 The Commerce Department reported that personal incomes rose only 0.1 percent in July, half the rate of increase in June and the slowest pace since October 2002. Income from wages rose by 0.4 percent, driven by increases in the number of hours worked and hourly wages. But rental income fell, as did some government transfers to the private sector. 
 With little income growth, spending was held up by the same fuel that has been propping up the economy of the last three years: debt. This in turn drove personal savings down to 0.6 percent of disposable income -- the lowest level this year. 
 ''It's a nice rebound in spending, but it is coming because of consumers' continued willingness to borrow,'' said Avery Shenfeld of CIBC World Markets in Toronto. ''After such a long run of borrowing at low interest rates, this points to the fragility of consumer spending ahead.''
 The debt-fueled nature of spending can be seen in what Americans have been buying. In June, most of the drop in sales of durable goods was from a fall in auto sales. In July, virtually all of the rebound was cars, too. 
 Paul Ballew, head of market and industry analysis for General Motors, said that the July jump in sales corresponded with the summer sell-down, when car makers offer deals to clear the lots of the current year's models. ''Consumers are timing their purchases more,'' Mr. Ballew said. ''That has changed.''
 Most cars are bought on credit. So the gyrations of the market are dependent on the variations of the incentives offered by the auto companies. And Mr. Ballew said that, on average, monthly payments have fallen to barely 6 percent of average household income -- the lowest level since measurement started in the 1960's.
 Yet economists caution that this credit-driven spending will dry out if incomes do not grow. ''It's not spending based on the conviction of people,'' Mr. Ricchiuto said. ''It's based on discounted cars.''

HEADLINE: Homeowners Come Up Short On Insurance

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: EL CAJON, Calif. 

 BODY:
Karla and Bruce Carroll remember the sheriff on his bullhorn ordering residents to evacuate and, minutes later, hearing the roar of monstrous flames arcing toward their modest home here in the hills above San Diego.
 Mrs. Carroll grabbed a family photo album as they ran to safety; Mr. Carroll started to gather his fishing rods. But she hustled him along. ''Don't worry about those things,'' she recalls saying at the time. ''We've got insurance.'' 
 But, the Carrolls say, the insurance they bought from State Farm, the nation's largest property insurer, has left them at least $100,000 short of the cost of rebuilding their home. Today, nearly a year later, they are still wrangling with their insurer and living in a 29-foot-long house trailer on the land where their three-bedroom home once stood, overlooking a spectacular sweep of ridges and canyons. 
 Their woeful shortfall in insurance coverage, experts say, is a plight shared unknowingly by millions of American homeowners. It has been fed largely by a shift in the way property insurance has been sold in recent years.
 In a move to cut costs from claims, insurance companies began in the late 1990's to phase out coverage that guaranteed the replacement of a destroyed home, regardless of the expense to the insurer. In place of that unlimited coverage, which had become nearly universal, insurers substituted a similar-sounding policy with a crucial difference: it pays only the amount stated on the policy plus, typically, an additional 20 percent to 25 percent.
 For their part, insurers insist that it is the consumer's responsibility to acquire adequate coverage.
 The old policy was called a guaranteed replacement policy. The new one, which most Americans now have, is called an extended replacement policy. 
 ''People look at this and it says 'replacement' and they think, 'That's good, I get my house replaced,''' said John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner in California. ''But they don't get their house replaced. They get money up to the set limits plus the extended 20 percent or 25 percent.''
 Marshall & Swift/Boeckh, a Los Angeles company that most insurers rely on for help in calculating the value of houses, estimates that 64 percent of American homes are underinsured by an average of 27 percent, with some homes underinsured by 60 percent or more.
 Another insurance industry company, AIR Worldwide in Boston, estimates that many upper-income homes in New England are underinsured by 30 percent to 40 percent.
 ''The underinsurance problem lies just beneath the surface all across the country,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. 
 The insurance gap has been worsened by the nationwide housing boom that has been rapidly driving up the cost of lumber, bricks, cement and other construction materials, industry executives say. And in Southern California, rebuilding costs soared even higher as the demand for contractors and building supplies suddenly jumped after the Carrolls' home and several thousand others were destroyed in wildfires over a few days last October. 
 But such explanations do not satisfy the industry's critics, who say insurers have shifted the burden of such mistakes onto homeowners.
 ''Most people go to their insurance agent to buy coverage and figure they're fully covered,'' said J. Robert Hunter, the director for insurance at the Consumer Federation of America. ''But often they're not.''
 The issue of underinsurance has not attracted much attention because, of the millions of insurance claims every year, fewer than 2 percent are for the total loss of a house. But the wildfires here last fall came as a jolt. They quickly incinerated more than 3,700 homes and, Mr. Garamendi said, ''a very large proportion'' of them were underinsured. 
 Consumer advocates and industry executives expect similar problems for the victims of Hurricane Charley in Florida as they begin working through their claims.
 ''The problem is everywhere,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''The disasters simply expose it.''
 George Kehrer, a lawyer and building contractor who founded Community Assisting Recovery in Los Angeles more than a decade ago to help people with insurance claims after disasters, said he had spoken to 1,200 people who lost homes in the California fires.
 ''About a dozen of them,'' he said, ''were adequately insured.''
 No single factor is entirely to blame for the underinsurance, consumer advocates and industry executives say. Homeowners, they say, need to recognize their own responsibility.
 But under pressure to make sales, Mr. Garamendi and consumer advocates explain, insurance companies and their agents often aim low in valuing houses. The goal, they say, is to keep premiums down to keep customers from going to competitors, and sometimes even a few dollars can make a difference. 
 ''If they quote a realistic replacement cost, the price of the policy goes up,'' Mr. Garamendi said, ''so they are motivated to keep the replacement cost down.'' 
 Insurance industry executives argue that it would make no sense to undervalue homes intentionally. The higher the insurance coverage, the higher the premium, they point out.
 But Mr. Garamendi disagrees. ''You want the sale first,'' he said. ''O.K., you can get a little more premium if you give full coverage. But you lose the sale.''
 Mr. Hunter, the consumer advocate, said agents often lacked the training to assess accurately the value of a home, usually done these days with the help of a computer program. Rarely do the agents leave their offices to assess a house personally, agents and industry executives said. 
 Mr. Garamendi said some agents inadvertently undervalued homes by using a computer shortcut to obtain what is known as a ''quick quote.'' Then, when a customer decides to buy coverage, the agent fails to add details like designer cabinets and fixtures that tend to increase the replacement estimate and the cost of the insurance.
 While most insurance policies include a built-in escalator to keep pace with general inflation, the costs of building supplies and paying for construction crews have been rising at a faster pace, in many cases widening the gap between the amount a house is insured for and what it will cost to rebuild it. 
 Another factor in the insurance gap has been a failure by some homeowners to increase coverage after the spurt in home improvements, from new kitchens to extra bedrooms, as millions of Americans have used cheap money from mortgage refinancings in recent years to upgrade their homes.
 Still, in dozens of interviews over several days this month, owners of the homes in Southern California that were destroyed said repeatedly that they had been led to believe they had bought enough coverage to rebuild their homes and were stunned to find out they were wrong. 
 Mrs. Carroll said she first bought her insurance from State Farm in 1998 shortly after she and her husband acquired their home for $172,500. 
 ''I told them I wanted full coverage for my house,'' she said. ''I've lived in this area most of my life, and I knew there was a huge fire risk here. I had been evacuated for fires three times as a child.''
 Two years later, she said, she checked back with the agent to make sure she had enough coverage and increased the coverage for possible additional costs as a result of changes in building codes.
 ''I said, 'Are you sure this is enough to replace the house?' and she said, 'Oh, that's plenty of coverage,''' Mrs. Carroll recalled. ''She had me convinced my house could burn or fall down in the canyon under heavy rains and, yeah, it's covered.''
 At the time of the fire, the Carrolls' house was insured by State Farm for $126,000, which, following standard practice, did not reflect the value of the land. Their annual premium was $730.
 With 20 percent in extended replacement coverage and other standard features including a built-in adjustment for inflation and coverage on their two-car garage, fences and driveway as well as an additional 25 percent for anticipated building code changes -- upgraded by Mrs. Carroll from the usual 10 percent -- the Carrolls estimate their policy will pay them about $222,000. But Mrs. Carroll said a contractor hired by State Farm estimated that replacing their losses, not including their clothing and other personal things, would cost nearly $400,000. 
 Bill Sirola, a spokesman for State Farm, said it was not clear whether the Carrolls were underinsured. ''We are working with that family,'' Mr. Sirola said. ''We are working with other builders on their behalf to get other estimates of their rebuilding costs.''
 As the insurance companies see it, if people are underinsured it is primarily their own fault.
 ''It's the homeowner's responsibility to see that his home is properly insured,'' said Mr. Hartwig of the Insurance Information Institute.
 Insurers say the terms of coverage are clearly spelled out in their policies. In California, insurers are also required to mail a statement annually specifying the terms of coverage along with renewal notices.
 But many homeowners burned out by last year's fires say they made clear they wanted to be able to replace their homes. In interviews, they said they had no way of knowing how much insurance they needed and relied on the agent to set the proper value and charge the appropriate price. Many say they would have been willing to pay more to assure themselves that their losses would be fully covered.
 ''They're the experts,'' said Donald McCormick, a high school math teacher, who lost his home in the Scripps Ranch section of San Diego. ''I don't go to the doctor and tell him how to do surgery.''

 BODY:

AIRLINE FOOD -- Two years after free meals became largely a memory (good or bad) in the coach cabins of many domestic flights, American Airlines is considering joining competitors that started selling meals to passengers after eliminating free meals during the post-9/11 slump in business. American said it would begin testing in-flight food sales in September on selected flights, including some between Dallas and New York and New York and Phoenix. Meals will cost $5 to $7. If the tests are successful and American expands the service throughout its domestic schedule, the airline, the world's largest, will join most major airlines and a handful of low-cost carriers in selling food in coach on some or all flights. (In business and first class, free meals are still the norm.) Among the major carriers, only Continental still serves free meals in coach on most domestic flights.

FUEL PRICES -- The airlines insist they are not crying wolf about the trouble that high oil prices are causing. ''While the soaring price of fuel is a huge problem for the economy, it is rapidly becoming a catastrophe for the airline industry,'' according to a letter to Congress signed by the chairmen of most domestic airlines. The letter states that at current prices, the fuel bill this year for the nation's airlines will be $6 billion more than it would have been with last year's prices. The letter, sent under the aegis of the Air Transport Association, asks for oversight hearings to review the ''feverish speculation'' in oil markets. ''We are convinced,'' the letter says, ''that the only thing that will stop the wild increase in prices is fear by the speculators that the U.S. government is ready to step in with actions that could either increase supply or reduce demand.''

BIGGER LITTLE PLANES -- Relief is on the way for frequent fliers who hate regional jets, which typically have about 50 seats crammed into a cabin with little legroom or overhead space. Airlines are kicking the tires on a new breed of higher-capacity 70-to-120-seat regional jets with more comfortable interiors (and more efficient engines). Manufacturers will produce 387 regional jets this year, and that number will include ''a progressively higher proportion of larger capacity aircraft'' than in recent years, says Forecast International, an aviation research company. During the next 10 years, production of 70-to-120-seat regional jets will be ''particularly dynamic,'' it says. Two aircraft makers, Bombardier and Embraer, have recently introduced such aircraft: the Embraer 190 and 195, now in production, and the CRJ-900. Boeing's 717-200 and Airbus's A318 aircraft are also designed to compete in that growing market, Forecast International says.

BUSINESS IN VIETNAM -- Millions of Vietnam veterans passed through the dusty Tan Son Nhut airfield in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, in the days when it was mostly a busy military base. In a further sign that Vietnam has now become a business-travel center in Southeast Asia, construction started last week on a $220 million terminal that will increase the airport's capacity to as much as 17 million passengers a year, according to the news service Asia Pulse.

LABOR DAY CROWDS -- AAA is predicting ''potentially record high'' travel this Labor Day weekend. That includes an 11 percent increase from a year earlier in the number of air travelers, to 3.9 million, the automobile association says. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Such Clean-Living, Early-to-Rise Delegates. Don't They Know There's a Minibar?

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Behold the Republican delegations. They make such a nice impression as they parade around town, neatly coiffed and tailored. But what are they really like?
 In search of the answer to this question, a highly unscientific survey was conducted yesterday at the service entrances of four of the delegates' hotels. The respondents -- heavily weighted toward smokers, as they were more likely to venture into the muggy air on their breaks -- were pretty much unanimous: so far, in their hotel rooms anyway, the ladies and gentlemen in red are leading very clean lives indeed in New York, in every sense of the word. 
 ''They're drinking only water,'' said Daniel Kelly, the minibar attendant at the W on Lexington Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, temporary home to the delegations from Arkansas and Maine. ''I sold one beer so far'' -- an Amstel Lite at that, to a delegate from Arkansas. ''It's not what I expected.'' 
 What did Mr. Kelly, who has been catering to the alcoholic tastes of conventioneers of all sorts for 13 years, expect? ''Partying. It's a free ride, you're in New York. But everybody's out of their rooms already.'' It was a few minutes after noon. ''No 'Do Not Disturb' signs.''
 A woman who works in the laundry at the W, who gave her name only as Mrs. Kelly, no relation, reported that the delegates' linens were ''very, very clean.'' At the Park Central on West 56th Street, Martin Benjamin, a building engineer, said the delegates from Idaho, Kansas and Maryland were not putting any undue strain on the plumbing system.
 ''They're about average,'' he said. Mr. Benjamin, 40, said he had noticed something else: even before last night's opening bell, the delegates were really, really busy. ''Whenever I come into their rooms, they're always on the phone,'' he said.
 Carla Randau, a floor supervisor at Roy's, the restaurant at the Marriott Financial Center, concurred. ''I have to admit a couple of them seem a little hectic,'' Ms. Randau said. ''They seem like they're on a very tight schedule. We get a lot of orders to go.''
 Many hotel workers took the delegates' apparent industriousness as a positive sign.
 ''It's a good thing that they're not ordering liquor,'' Ronald Epps, a housekeeping worker, said as he stood among the smokers. ''It's good for the country. It means they're taking care of business.''
 Mr. Kelly, a Republican from Woodside, Queens, agreed. ''They've got something to prove,'' he said. ''They've got to show the other side that they're not the beasts people think they are.''
 A man who works in reservations at the W, who gave his name only as Robert, said that in fact, the delegates were an improvement on the normal customer. ''Our regular guests are a lot more obnoxious,'' Robert said. ''They demand a lot of upgrades. These guys don't.'' 
 At worst, said Flor Barrera, a housekeeper at the Park Central, the delegates were unremarkable guests. ''They look like regular tourists,'' she said. ''They don't bother me at all.''
 Carlos Nieves, who restocks housekeeping supplies at the Roosevelt on East 45th Street, said the delegates at her hotel, from Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Oregon, seemed to be supporting the local economy. ''They're doing a lot of shopping, by the looks of their garbage,'' he said. ''A lot of souvenirs, a lot of clothing.''
 And notwithstanding their full schedules, the delegates were not too busy for small kindnesses. On his breast pocket, Mr. Nieves wore an Arizona state flag pin, a gift from a delegate. ''He said, 'Would you like a pin from Arizona?''' Mr. Nieves recalled. ''I said O.K. Then he said, 'What do you think of the president?' I said, 'No disrespect, but I don't care about politics.'''
 As for whether the delegates will be willing to part with more than pins, the jury was still out. ''Nothing yet,'' said Mr. Benjamin, an immigrant from Guyana who is supporting his wife and 1-year-old twins from his wages at the W hotel and says he sometimes receives tips from guests. 
 Of course, just because the delegates are making nice does not mean that the average hotel employee will vote for their leader. A middle-aged woman with a ponytail coming out the back of the Sheraton Manhattan at 51st Street and Seventh Avenue yesterday, where delegations from four states are quartered, sported a rather vulgar anti-Bush button on her purse.
 She did not seem to care who saw it. ''That's my personal feeling,'' she said, holding a lighter to her Newport.

HEADLINE: Oil Futures Fall Nearly $1; Price Is Lowest Since Late July

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Crude oil futures dropped nearly $1 a barrel yesterday despite pipeline sabotage in Iraq that has delayed exports from a southern port, reinforcing the view among traders that prices rose too quickly this summer.
 There were also signs yesterday that a peace deal reached in Najaf, Iraq, last week could spread to other parts of the country, raising hopes that saboteurs might stop attacking oil pipelines. 
 Light sweet crude for October delivery dropped by 90 cents, to settle at $42.28, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude futures are at their lowest level since July 27 and roughly 14 percent below the record settlement high of $48.70 on Aug. 19. When adjusted for inflation, oil prices are about half the level reached in 1981 after the revolution in Iran.
 Oil markets have been extremely volatile this summer because of traders' concerns that global supplies would be inadequate if a prolonged output disruption occurred in Iraq, Russia or Venezuela.
 But with the exception of sporadic drops in Iraqi oil exports because of attacks on the industry's infrastructure, none of these fears have materialized.
 Regardless of how badly the oil flow was hindered in Iraq yesterday, ''two weeks ago, with that news, we would have been up more than $1,'' said Tom Bentz, a trader at BNP Paribas Futures in New York. ''The tide has definitely turned.''
 Oil price speculation by institutional investors, including hedge funds, magnified this summer's surge in prices, as well as the latest retreat, traders said.
 Also yesterday, the president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the cartel was ''doing everything it can to restore and stabilize oil prices.''

HEADLINE: Shares Are Broadly Lower in Extremely Light Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday in extremely thin trading as security concerns surrounding the Republican National Convention in New York and worries about earnings kept investors on the sidelines.
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had closed at a six-week high on Friday, fell 72.49 points, or 0.71 percent, to 10,122.52. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 8.62 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,099.15. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index fared worse, losing 25.60 points, or 1.37 percent, and closing at 1,836.49. 
 Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered those advancing by about 3 to 2, and by more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. The light volume is expected to continue this week as many New Yorkers are staying out of the city during the convention, which opened yesterday. The week before Labor Day, on Sept. 6 this year, is also popular for summer vacations on Wall Street.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the lightest so far this year, at 847 million shares, down from 865 million on Friday, and well below the 1.4 billion share daily average last year. Just over one billion shares were traded in the Nasdaq market, well below its 1.69 billion daily average last year. With volume so low, traders were unwilling to read much into the decline in prices.
 ''There really is not much going on, but there's been slightly more negative news than positive news,'' said Rick Meckler, the president of LibertyView Capital Management. ''A lot of traders picked this week to take off, with the convention in town and all the transportation problems.''
 Data released yesterday provided a mixed view of the economy. Consumer spending rebounded sharply in July, bolstering hopes that the economy had come out of its recent softness. But personal income advanced at a more modest pace than expected, with July's reading the weakest since late 2002.
 ''Any slightly negative news could be moving things down,'' said Ozan Akcin, chief market strategist at Puglisi & Company. ''Our view is that fundamentals have been generally looking very good. Corporate earnings are good, and economic growth is coming in nice and solid. But we have a lot of factors that investors are trying to get past, such as terrorism, Iraq and the Republican convention, and I think some of those factors are keeping investors at bay.''
 In corporate news, Tyson Foods, the country's largest meat company, lowered its forecast for the year. Its shares fell $1.47, or more than 8 percent, to $16.26.
 Among stocks weighing on Nasdaq were those of computer chip manufacturers, which had moved higher on Friday.
 Intel, the largest chip maker, fell 42 cents, to $21.60, in advance of its midquarter business update on Thursday. In a preview of the update, Smith Barney said there was a risk that Intel could lower its revenue forecast. Altera declined 22 cents, to $19.08, while Texas Instruments dropped more than 3 percent, down 63 cents, to $19.71. 
 Other technology issues were also lower. Microsoft fell 16 cents, to $27.30. The company said on Friday that the next version of its operating system would not be introduced until 2006, and it scaled back plans for an important feature.
 On the bond market yesterday, Treasury prices rallied after an inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve, the core personal consumption spending price index, was flat in July, suggesting no need to accelerate interest rate increases. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 12/32, to 100 18/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.18 percent from 4.23 percent on Friday. Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.601	99.103	High Rate	1.580	1.775	Investment Rate	1.607	1.815	Low Rate	1.560	1.745	Median Rate	1.565	1.765	Total applied for	$44,426,075	$42,313,417	Accepted	$26,132,275	$23,448,767	Noncompetitive	$1,405,436	$988,197	

Both issues are dated Sept. 02, 2004. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 02, 2004 and the six-month bills mature on March 03, 2005.

HEADLINE: A Salute to James Doohan, Who Beamed People Up as Scotty

BYLINE: By WILLIAM S. KOWINSKI

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Could ''Star Trek'' be dying? It's enough to make Mr. Spock laugh.
 ''This is so funny,'' said Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock, directed two ''Star Trek'' feature films and produced another. '''Star Trek' has died several times and come back stronger than ever.''
 Over the weekend Mr. Nimoy joined others from the cast of the original ''Star Trek'' television series at a fan convention here organized by Planet Xpo to honor James Doohan, who played Scotty, the Enterprise engineer, in his last convention appearance. Mr. Doohan, who is to receive his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Tuesday, is showing signs of Alzheimer's disease, a family spokesman said. So with the exception of DeForest Kelley, who played Dr. Leonard McCoy and died in 1999, the Enterprise crew gathered one last time on Sunday. 
 There are reasons to question ''Star Trek's'' continued viability. Though the feature film series has grossed more than a billion dollars for Paramount, the last two outings have sputtered at the box office. The most recent release, ''Star Trek Nemesis,'' could not hold its own against installments of the ''Lord of the Rings'' and ''Harry Potter'' film series in the summer of 2002. 
 And since ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' received an Emmy nomination as best dramatic series and left the air a legitimate hit in 1994, subsequent ''Star Trek'' television dramas have slowly lost ratings ground. Completing its third season last spring after a generally rough ratings year for television drama, the current series, ''Star Trek: Enterprise,'' faced cancellation by UPN. 
 In an echo of the original series's fate, it was saved after a fan letter-writing campaign but rescheduled on Fridays at 8 p.m. for the coming season, beginning in October. Both the UPN president, Dawn Ostroff, and the Paramount television president, Garry Hart, point to the example of ''The X Files,'' a series aimed at similar viewers, that found its audience on Fridays. (They are also happy that ''Enterprise'' will no longer be competing with ''American Idol.'')
 Still, Friday has also been a graveyard for shows meant to appeal to young adult viewers, including the original ''Star Trek'' in 1969.
 Even Mr. Nimoy sees cause for concern. He likens the current situation to the period after the first ''Star Trek'' feature film, when ''I felt that 'Star Trek' was like a beached whale,'' he said. ''I think something similar is happening now. 'Star Trek' is in this stranded situation. The ideas that were propelling it have run dry.'' 
 Some people suggest the problem is audience fatigue. Some say it is creative exhaustion. One solution to both, several actors, writers, producers and directors of past ''Star Trek'' incarnations say, may be to stop making new ''Star Trek'' stories for a while. 
 ''As soon as one series ends, the next one begins right away,'' said Denise Crosby, an actor in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' as well as executive producer of the new documentary ''Trekkies 2.'' ''How can you sustain that? The bar has been raised so high with sci-fi films. I'm not talking just about special effects but interesting, elaborate tales. You need to step back and refocus on what's pertinent to this moment in time.''
 LeVar Burton, who directed 27 episodes of four ''Star Trek'' series and was a star of ''The Next Generation,'' also favors a hiatus. '''Star Trek's' just not special enough, not anymore,'' he said. ''They need to shut the whole thing down, wait five years, create an interest, an excitement, a hunger for it again.'' 
 The convention here offers an opportunity to look back at a 40-year cultural phenomenon that has produced 10 movies, hundreds of hours of 5 TV series and some of the most devoted fans in entertainment history. On Tuesday Paramount is releasing ''Trekkies 2'' on DVD. it is about those fans, and the DVD set of the first season of the original ''Star Trek'' series.
 Trekkies are of two minds' about the franchise's trajectory. ''There's a large group that thinks it's time to give ''Trek'' a rest,'' said Michael W. Malotte, president of the International ''Star Trek'' Fan Association, with 230 chapters worldwide. ''There's another group that says, 'I enjoy Trek, I don't agree with a lot of what they're doing, but I still enjoy watching.'''
 Those who are rooting for more new ''Star Trek'' are buzzing this summer about Manny Coto, the new co-executive producer of the current series, ''Enterprise,'' which is set in the century before Capt. James T. Kirk, the original commander. ''My goal is to deepen and expand its relationship to the 'Star Trek' universe,'' Mr. Coto said, ''to fulfill its promise as a true prequel series.'' 
 This relationship will be made visible with the appearance of Brent Spiner (who played Mr. Data in ''The Next Generation'') in a story told over three episodes, the coming season's preferred format. Mr. Burton is to direct the third of these episodes. Negotiations are under way for a similar appearance by William Shatner, perhaps even playing Captain Kirk.
 Another arc of stories will concern civil war on Vulcan, Mr. Spock's planet, which Mr. Coto says will covertly examine ''the war in Iraq and the direction of the country.'' That story line reflects ''Star Trek's'' longstanding commitment to, as Mr. Burton puts it, ''comment on our present condition by examining it in a future context.''
 Even if a pause could be creatively useful, commercial calculation will probably determine ''Star Trek's'' fate, and its recent problems may not be decisive. 
 ''Movies cost so much to make that apparently the only thing that strikes the studios as worth doing is franchise-related,'' said Nicholas Meyer, who directed ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' and ''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.'' ''Whether it's other movies, comic books, video games, it doesn't matter, as long as there is some presale. Which is not to say they can't turn out a good movie. A lot of good things are done for the wrong reasons.'' 
 Though he acknowledges that the performance of ''Star Trek Nemesis'' was disappointing, Rick Berman, the film's producer and the executive producer of the current ''Enterprise'' television series. noted that it was the 10th film in the series, ''and I highly doubt it was the last.'' Discussions about the next film are ''in a very preliminary stage,'' he said, adding that the story being considered ''would not involve any of the casts that have existed in previous films and television series.'' 
 Mr. Hart, the Paramount executive, said that while another ''Star Trek'' television series was not being planned, he doubted that there would be more than a season or two pause after ''Enterprise'' before the next incarnation. 
 '''Star Trek' has been the most successful franchise in the history of television,'' he said. ''I have no doubt there will be a demand for more 'Star Trek' on television.'' 
 Even if ''Star Trek'' pauses or stops, most people agree that the fan clubs and conventions will continue. In some ways, fandom has become self-sufficient. For years fans have created and disseminated their own ''Star Trek'' stories, first on mimeographed pages, then on fan fiction Internet sites. Now, with increasingly accessible digital technology, they are creating their own films. 
 ''They are no longer bound by what the TV tells them to do,'' said Eugene Roddenberry, the 30-year-old son of ''Star Trek's'' creator, Gene Roddenberry, who recently agreed to help produce a live-action fan film. ''They can go do it themselves, which I love.''
 Eugene Roddenberry is also working on a documentary called ''Trek Nation,'' which highlights ''Star Trek's'' impact on world culture and its fans' lives. Fan organizations typically do charity work and public service, and some require it. 
 ''Many fans live their lives by these philosophies like the Prime Directive and I.D.I.C.,'' said Roger Nygard, director of ''Trekkies 2.'' The Prime Directive was to avoid interfereing with less advanced cultures, and fans have adopted it as a principle of noninterference. I.D.I.C. stands for ''infinite diversity in infinite combinations,'' the Vulcan motto adopted by fans to summarize Star Trek's commitment to diversity and equality.
 Over the weekend the original ''Star Trek'' actors emphasized those themes to their convention audiences, as they usually do. 
 ''Because the fans are loyal to Gene's dream, we are loyal to the fans,'' Nichelle Nichols said on Sunday. She played Uhura, the communications officer. 
 The bond goes both ways. ''In a society with so much violence and stupidity, the conventions are an oasis where you can find some genuinely good people who believe in humanity and respect the rights of others,'' said Walter Koenig, who played Ensign Pavel Chekov, the assistant navigator on the Enterprise.
 ''Star Trek'' is notable for having created its own elaborate history of the future, which together with its themes, best stories and strongest characters add up to a modern mythology. ''You'd be hard pressed to find anybody who doesn't know what a Klingon is, or doesn't know what 'Beam me up, Scotty' is all about,'' Mr. Berman said. ''It is a phenomenon that will continue to exist, and whether it will continue to exist after a pause or not, probably in the long run doesn't matter.''
 Just one indication of ''Star Trek's'' intersection with real life came at the convention on Saturday night, when the featured speaker at the banquet honoring Mr. Doohan was Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon. 
 Ending a talk full of ''Star Trek'' references, including a wish for a Federation starship for his next command, Mr. Armstrong addressed Mr. Doohan: ''From one old engineer to another: thanks, mate.''

HEADLINE: Overtime Rules Dispute Is a Numbers Game

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
As a sous-chef at a premier Washington hotel, James Ware has won acclaim for creating succulent dishes like rockfish in a Chablis sauce with capers.
 But Mr. Ware fears that his inventiveness could cost him dearly, because under new federal labor rules it might cause him to be classified as a learned professional, making him ineligible for overtime pay. Since overtime is often one-third of his paycheck, Mr. Ware is fuming about the new rules, which the Bush administration put into effect last week. 
 ''It's bad for workers; it seems like a step backward,'' Mr. Ware said. 
 Over the past week, the new regulations have become a hot political subject, as Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, has asserted that six million workers will lose overtime coverage under the administration's new rules. The Democrats contend that the regulations show that President Bush is once again rewarding his corporate friends at the expense of workers.
 But the administration insists that the new rules will help workers, not hurt them, and enable 1.3 million more workers to become eligible for overtime. Officials argue that the regulations will help employer and employee by reducing ambiguous language and costly litigation.
 ''Anyone who looks at this objectively will see this is a tremendous benefit to workers and is a big benefit to businesses even though they will have to pay more for overtime,'' said Howard M. Radzely, the Labor Department's top lawyer.
 The new rules are so complex and the arguments from the two sides so fierce and contradictory that it is hard to determine how many workers will gain or lose eligibility. The answer may depend on how aggressively corporations use the rules to reclassify workers as exempt from overtime, meaning that they will receive no extra pay when they work more than 40 hours a week.
 Many business groups and management lawyers back the administration and say the rules will cause few workers to lose eligibility. But some nonpartisan experts, seeing a pro-business tilt in the revised rules, say the administration is wrong to assert that more workers will gain overtime coverage than lose it.
 ''The data isn't there for the Labor Department to say 1.3 million workers will gain eligibility,'' said John R. Fraser, the federal government's top wage-and-hour official under the first President Bush and President Bill Clinton. ''By my analysis, under the new regulations, 3, 4 or 5 million Americans could easily lose overtime coverage.''
 The new rules, which interpret the Fair Labor Standards Act, apply to salaried white-collar workers only and spell out criteria to determine which executive, administrative and professional employees are ineligible for overtime pay.
 Mr. Fraser, who headed the Wage and Hour Administration of the Labor Department in the 1990's, estimates that 20 percent of the nation's 72 million white-collar workers are already exempt from overtime pay, including many executives and learned professionals like lawyers. 
 ''I would fearlessly predict that under these rules, within three years or five years, instead of 20 percent of workers being exempt, it will be 25 or 30 percent,'' Mr. Fraser said.
 Jay Whitehead, publisher of HRO Today, one of the leading magazines for human resources executives, agreed that many more workers would be exempted under the new rules. He said that because of the more expansive criteria, 130,000 more cooks would be exempted as well as 90,000 computer workers and 160,000 mortgage loan officers. 
 ''The administration's numbers are clearly just wrong or they forgot to include a bunch of people,'' he said. ''There's no question that fewer people will be eligible. About 4 million people will lose eligibility, 1.3 million will gain, so the net will be 2.7 million more ineligible.''
 The nation's corporations would save billions of dollars yearly if millions more workers lose their right to overtime. With job growth slow and wages stagnant, labor unions have attacked the rules, asserting that companies will be able to order more employees to work overtime without paying extra and that this may discourage companies from hiring more workers. 
 The Bush administration and many corporate lawyers assert that the Democrats and unions have systematically misrepresented the effects of the new rules. They lambaste in particular the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, for estimating that six million workers would lose overtime eligibility, an estimate that Mr. Kerry and labor leaders have invoked repeatedly to criticize President Bush. 
 ''These attacks, which suggest that this is some sort of a partisan effort to undo overtime, are ridiculous,'' said William Kilberg, a Washington lawyer who advises corporations on wage-and-hour matters.
 Labor Department officials insist that the revamped criteria for who is ineligible are no more business-friendly than the old rules and prevailing case law. These officials say the regulations are merely an effort to update outmoded rules and to eliminate ambiguities that have generated mountains of litigation over who deserves overtime.
 In the biggest pro-worker change, no employee earning less than $455 a week ($23,660 a year) can be exempted from overtime. The old rule, last updated three decades ago, when the minimum wage was far lower, stated that no worker earning less than $155 a week could be exempted. The administration estimates that 1.3 million workers, like once-exempt $11-an-hour assistant store managers, will become eligible under this provision, although administration critics say at most 500,000 will.
 Another change makes it easier to exempt white-collar workers earning more than $100,000: the test for exemption has been greatly weakened for this group. The administration estimates that 107,000 of these high-paid workers will lose eligibility.
 Administration officials say it is too hard to estimate how many workers earning between $23,660 and $100,000 will lose or gain eligibility, but the administration's critics insist that millions will. These critics say the rules are full of revised language that makes it easier to exempt workers in this group. 
 Critics note that the rules say that chefs with four-year culinary degrees can now be classified as exempt learned professionals, just like lawyers. Under the rules, inventive chefs might also be exempted as creative professionals. Critics also question why the new rules say funeral directors and athletic trainers can be exempted as learned professionals.
 The administration says the courts have already held that funeral directors and athletic trainers can be exempted as learned professionals because they often require years of college for certification. 
 ''I think some employers are going to take advantage and try to fit into some of the loopholes, and some will take an ultraconservative stance to make sure they don't misclassify anyone as exempt,'' said Nancy Shallow, a specialist in employment practices with Mercer Human Resource Consulting. ''And some of these issues are still going to be litigated.''

HEADLINE: In Iraq, a Quest to Rebuild One More Broken Edifice: Science

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
An ancient fan rattles away in a window as chemical fumes waft by rotting laboratory benches and corroding racks of tubes. A young graduate student, Farah Yassien, perspires in the oppressive afternoon heat as she labors over an experiment involving the drip, drip, drip of benzene and hexane.
 This is a chemical engineering laboratory at Baghdad University, the most respected institution of higher education in Iraq. And striding through the ruined lab is Dr. Hussain Shahristani, an Iraqi nuclear physicist, who in a nation of impossible dreams and broken infrastructure may have picked the most quixotic task of all. He hopes to restore Iraqi science to its former pre-eminence in the Middle East, and he has founded an Iraqi National Academy of Sciences to help him do so.
 Unlike the well-financed, prestigious academies of the West, Dr. Shahristani's has only 16 members, about half of them foreigners, and no budget to speak of. The academy members have no regular meeting place and at present huddle in an office at a university computer center. They have been largely ignored by both Iraqi and American officials, who presumably feel that they have more pressing problems. Furthermore, Iraqi research labs, like this one, are a crumbling, looted, odoriferous mess. 
 The most unlikely element in Dr. Shahristani's quest may be his decision to undertake it in the first place. He came within a hair's breadth of being named prime minister of Iraq last spring. He was tortured by Saddam Hussein's government for refusing to work on an atomic bomb and spent 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement, before escaping during the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
 Born in 1942 and educated in London and Toronto as well as Iraq, Dr. Shahristani often draws comparisons to Andrei Sakharov, the Russian physicist who was persecuted in the former Soviet Union for his outspoken views on human rights during the cold war. A Shiite Muslim, he is said to be close to Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the powerful Iraqi Shiite cleric.
 He has a strong commitment to democratic rule and pulls few punches on any topic.
 Jammed in the back of a car with no air-conditioning as he rushed to an appointment after the visit to the lab, he said there was little hope of quelling the continuing violence in Iraq without free and fair elections, planned for early next year. So far, he said, average Iraqis see the American-installed government here as just another unrepresentative regime and therefore they have no incentive to act against insurgents.
 ''If they mess up the election, then the country is down the drain,'' he said. ''Because, quite frankly, I think the Iraqi people have been too patient.''
 Dr. Shahristani briefly became the top contender for interim prime minister of Iraq in May, when it was leaked to journalists that he was favored by Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations envoy to Iraq, as a nonpolitical compromise choice. He withdrew because of opposition by various Iraqi political parties, but he did not rule out running in democratic elections.
 ''I will try to avoid it, as I did the first nomination,'' he said, but added that if he construed it as a personal duty, as defined by his Islamic faith, then he would run.
 For now, Dr. Shahristani, with the help of a handful of Iraqi, American and British colleagues, is trying to resurrect a scientific establishment that once pursued illicit weapons -- weapons the United States suspected were still under development before the recent invasion. Instead, by the time of the American-led invasion of Iraq last year to remove Mr. Hussein, that establishment turned out to be a crushed remnant of what it had been in the 1960's, 70's and 80's.
 ''The state of the science today is just abominable,'' said Dr. Farouk El-Baz, director of the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University and a board member at the Arab Science and Technology Foundation, which participated in a major assessment of Iraqi science in June. ''It is shameful. You cannot add to today's knowledge a penny if your state is like that.''
 Decades of authoritarian rule have left Iraqi science in even worse shape than meets the eye. Many scientists here have lost the ability to generate fresh ideas independently and then seek money to carry out the research.
 ''The whole science structure in the previous regime was based on isolating groups of scientists and telling them exactly what to do, without access to outside scientific groups,'' Dr. Shahristani said in an interview at his home in Baghdad. 
 ''For people who have been brought up in such a system,'' he added, ''it would be very difficult to say, 'O.K., you decide.'''
 Some analysts are harsher, suggesting that many Iraqi scientists are proving to be incapable of responding to the leadership of Dr. Shahristani and a few other academics and researchers.
 ''There doesn't seem to be the kind of motivation that you'd expect,'' said Stuart Schwartzstein, an official at the American Embassy in Baghdad who is an adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Science and Technology. ''There still seems to be a sense that they're waiting for orders to come down from on high, with the requisite resources. And that's probably not going to happen.''
 But a more democratic form of leadership is just what Dr. Shahristani hopes his academy will provide. He would also like to see the organization help restore the country's shattered medical infrastructure, address enormous pollution problems -- some left over from the nuclear and biological weapons programs of the 1980's -- and establish an ethical framework for scientific research.
 ''We wanted to be sure that science was never again misused in Iraq,'' he said.
 As the United States pours billions of dollars into reconstruction projects, there are other reasons to nurture scientists, engineers and medical researchers, said Irving Lerch, an American physicist and human rights advocate who has pressed for quicker action. ''We've got to give that country the intellectual capacity to rebuild itself,'' he said. ''If we want Iraq to be dependent on the United States for its security, for its rebuilding, for its life, then all we have to do is continue what we're doing.''
 By the early 1950's, the University of Baghdad had asserted itself as Iraq's leading institution of higher learning, according to an assessment by the Arab Science and Technology Foundation, based in the United Arab Emirates, and by Sandia National Laboratories in the United States. During that time, Iraqi-born scientists with degrees from Britain, the United States, France, Egypt, Lebanon and elsewhere streamed back to their homeland, invigorating academic fields from physics to economics. 
 New universities and about 80 technical institutes were established in the 1960's and 70's, and Iraq's technical infrastructure was the envy of the Middle East, Dr. El-Baz said.
 But then there was the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, which cost Iraq an estimated $100 billion. By the 1991 gulf war, most major research institutes had been shuttered or severely damaged. Scientists were drafted into the Iraqi Army and many died, or their careers languished. Economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 made it impossible even to stock the labs where scientists remained.
 After the invasion last year, almost everything that was left was gutted. ''On many campuses, every computer, light fixture, every stick of furniture, ceiling fans, doors, windows, in short everything of value was looted and then followed by devastating fires,'' a team of visiting university presidents from the United States wrote in a report last year for financial and educational advisers at the Coalition Provisional Authority, since dissolved.
 Attempts by the American occupation authorities to remedy some of the damage were delayed by the worsening security situation.
 Last November, Dr. Shahristani and his colleagues, including people like Mosa Aziz al-Mosawe, the president of Baghdad University, formally established the academy in a ceremony at the Royal Society in London. 
 There could hardly have been anyone in Iraq whose credentials, both moral and scientific, were better suited for making the proposition a success. It was in July 1980 when Barazan Tikriti, Mr. Hussein's half-brother and the head of the secret police, visited Dr. Shahristani as he lay on the floor, partly paralyzed after being tortured. Mr. Tikriti informed Dr. Shahristani that it was every man's duty to serve his country, and that anyone who did not had no right to be alive. Then he urged Dr. Shahristani to work on the Iraqi atomic bomb program.
 In one of scientific history's great acts of defiance, Dr. Shahristani said he served his country better by not working on the bomb. In the interview at his home, he said he feared Mr. Hussein would end up using an atomic weapon against his own people.
 Dr. Shahristani remained in prison for the next decade and managed to remain very much the scientist. Worried that Mr. Hussein would use chemical weaponry and harm the inmates where he was confined as the first gulf war approached, he taught them how to improvise gas masks with wet rags and charcoal. When the inmates began asking visiting family members for chunks of charcoal, prison officials suspected an effort to make a strange sort of bomb and began an investigation.
 But once again there was no bomb, and Dr. Shahristani escaped. On the strength of his remarkable reputation, he formed the national academy and quickly secured a promise from the Baghdad municipal government for the academy to occupy a modest three-story building at 6 Haifa Street if he could raise the money to renovate its looted interior.
 Then things started to go wrong. He managed to raise the money, only to be told by the Baghdad authorities that the building had been given to the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, which already had a headquarters building.
 Both the city's real estate department and the chairman of the Olympic committee, Ahmed A. al-Samarrai, said the committee simply got its paperwork in first. The building is to become an Olympic museum, Mr. Samarrai said.
 Dr. Shahristani asserts that the real estate department conspired with the Olympic committee to secure the building. 
 Finally, in May, Mr. Schwartzstein, of the United States Embassy, tried to secure the right to take over one of the hundreds of government-owned buildings controlled by the occupation authority.
 But the Americans took until July to process the request, and then an Iraqi claimed ownership, saying Mr. Hussein's government had wrongfully appropriated the property. So that building, too, slipped out of the academy's hands. 
 Ms. Yassien, the student at the Baghdad University lab, is forced to buy chemicals for her own experiments. She goes to a market called Bab al-Muadham and often sees other students trolling for bargains.
 The professors at the university, she said, ''can't do anything for us.''

HEADLINE: Swing-State Delegates Confident in Bush and Don't Much Like Kerry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Thomas Crampton, Mark Glassman and Marc Santora contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
They exude serene confidence about President Bush's re-election prospects. They talk of his likability and say the Iraq war and the economy should help him, not hurt him. And they plain don't like Senator John Kerry -- or his wife. 
 They are the president's front-line warriors in the battleground states, the Republican delegates and alternates from those too-close-to-call states that will decide the next election. And as the Republican National Convention got under way in New York yesterday, they spoke with great confidence about how they see the race shaping up.
 Several of the conventioneers spoke disdainfully of Senator Kerry in terms that were strikingly reminiscent of the way Al Gore was described by Republicans four years ago when he was the Democratic nominee, drawing contrasts between what they said was Mr. Kerry's ''flip-flopping'' on issues and Mr. Bush's ''integrity.'' 
 ''He's such a flim-flam fellow,'' said Barbara Wise, an alternate delegate from Brunswick, Ohio. ''That opponent of George Bush's is not to be trusted, and Ohioans can see that. He's just not a suitable person for the job of presidency. Nor is that wife of his; she's crass.''
 In interviews in and around Madison Square Garden with two dozen delegates and alternates from swing states, several brought up their dislike of Teresa Heinz Kerry without prompting. Joseph Bongiovanni, 60, a law professor from Philadelphia, said he did not believe that Mr. Bush needed to do much more to win over Pennsylvania voters because he thought the Kerrys -- especially Mrs. Kerry -- would undermine themselves.
 ''As soon as the people get to re-meet her, that will be the biggest help for Bush,'' he said, adding, ''although, she is a very attractive lady.''
 For the most part, the issues that the delegates said were important in their states were the issues that candidates have been talking about all year: fighting terrorism, the war in Iraq, education, the economy, health care. Some lauded Mr. Bush's opposition to gay marriage and urged him to stake out more conservative positions. Others said local issues would help decide the November election.
 In West Virginia, a state that had voted for only three Republican presidential candidates in the 70 years before Mr. Bush carried it in 2000, the big local issue is coal. 
 ''He is so involved in the energy issue, and coal is such a big part of it, that he packs Beckley, W.Va., when he comes to visit, which is unheard-of for a Republican,'' said Bob Ashley, 51, an insurance agent and member of the West Virginia House of Delegates who took a 12-hour bus ride to New York with the other delegates on Sunday. ''Those are things that count in our state, and he is big in trying to help.''
 Mr. Ashley said the recent attacks on Senator Kerry's Vietnam War record by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth had also increased Mr. Bush's prospects in the state. He said one member of the Swift boat group, Jack Chenoweth, had West Virginia roots, and had been interviewed recently on a local talk radio station.
 ''I think, with a West Virginia veteran who was a captain in the Swift boat ahead of him, it's been real interesting, his story,'' Mr. Ashley said, adding that he had been seeing more Bush-Cheney bumper stickers than Kerry-Edwards stickers on West Virginia's roadways. ''They're starting now to think, hey, this guy flips all the time, now maybe he's flipping on that. So that seems to have had an effect.''
 Delegates from several states say the best thing the president can do between now and November is visit their states again and again. 
 Gerald Pritchard, a 65-year-old delegate from Wallenport, Pa., said he thought the president would be able to make Pennsylvania a red state again simply by showing up. ''He's got to show up there and do the town hall meetings,'' he said, ''because if you meet George W. Bush, he's the most down-to-earth president we've ever had.''
 On the economic front, a delegate from Michigan urged Mr. Bush to outline more plans to help small businesses, and a delegate from Iowa said he should take the opportunity to show the American people that the Republican Party is not elitist.
 ''The president needs to convey that the Republican Party is not a party of the rich,'' said Bill Clark, 64, a delegate from Clive, Iowa, who is a psychotherapist. ''Outsiders may think differently, but when you are in the party you don't feel everyone is well-to-do.''
 Others urged Mr. Bush to stake out more conservative positions.
 Ferrell Blount, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, said, ''All George Bush has to do in North Carolina is basically turn his conservative base out.''
 Debbie L. Warner, 46, a homemaker and delegate from Morgantown, W.Va., who has four children, said, ''He needs to emphasize his Christian and his family values.''
 And Ahmed Kabani, 54, a delegate from Miami who runs his own travel agency, said: ''He needs to emphasize his agenda on conservative social issues. The most important of those issues is making sure there is no same-sex marriage.''
 As they walked through the hallway outside the convention floor as the morning session wound down, two members of the Pennsylvania delegation, Donna Cupp, 48, a homemaker from Indiana County, and Michele Mustello, 40, a recorder of deeds in Butler County, north of Pittsburgh, said they felt some pressure to help Mr. Bush win Pennsylvania in 2004, after he lost it narrowly in 2000. 
 ''At breakfast this morning, they were saying that if every precinct could just get 30 more votes, it wouldn't be a problem,'' Ms. Cupp said. ''We have to get new registrations, get people to cross over.''
 But she noted that there was a reason some commentators call Pennsylvania -- a state that is neither red nor blue -- a purple state.
 ''I think that there's a real polarization amongst people, because I have a lot of Democrat friends, and they are very hateful of Bush,'' Ms. Cupp said. ''But the Republicans just love him. And there's a real difference of opinion over how to do the war. And that's what we're hearing. So it always gets down to the middle. And everyone's going for the middle.''
 Ms. Mustello said she thought the president's positions on the economy, education and health care should help him win -- particularly the new prescription drug benefit for Medicare, which she said was a good thing even if it was so complicated that local officials have been holding seminars to teach elderly people how to use it.
 Ms. Cupp said the Pennsylvania delegates got a pair of flip-flops in their welcome packet, a reminder of the Republican view of Mr. Kerry.
 ''It's a joke, because he does flip-flop on every single issue,'' she said. ''You can't pin him down. He'll say one thing one time and completely reverse himself on another occasion. So who really knows what he stands for?''
 But Ms. Mustello said Mr. Kerry was hardly mentioned at all in the speeches to their delegation. ''It's not like, 'Kerry, he's a loser,''' she explained. ''It's not like that. It's just like, 'President Bush is the man, and we want to keep him in another four years.'''
 Brad Sinnott, who is the central committee chairman for the Franklin County Republican Party in Ohio, said people there, like Americans everywhere, were worried about Iraq. He said the Bush-Cheney camp has done a good job getting out the word about American success in Iraq, but they still needed to do more. And that means, he said, more appearances by the candidates in Ohio.
 Franklin County is split evenly for the two major candidates, he said, with about 40 percent favoring each and the remaining voters undecided. 
 ''There needs to be an emphasis on getting out the Bush vote,'' Mr. Sinnott said. 
 To that end, he said, Republicans are mounting an aggressive registration campaign until Oct. 4, and will run an intense get-out-the-vote effort in the final 72 hours before Election Day. 
 ''It's neck and neck in Franklin County, which mirrors the whole country,'' he said. ''But I'm optimistic.''

HEADLINE: The Natural: Giuliani Plays Role of Backer With Relish

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani's spirited address last night at Madison Square Garden followed weeks of marathon campaigning for President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. From personal appearances on the campaign trail to television spots and radio and newspaper interviews, Mr. Giuliani seemed to be everywhere aiding the re-election effort, a role that is tailor-made for the former mayor.
 The speech was a high point for Mr. Giuliani as he repeatedly brought the crowd to its feet, trying to take the moral high ground, invoking the memories of Sept. 11, while also throwing the crowd political red meat, attacking the Democratic nominee John Kerry. 
 ''Maybe this explains John Edwards's need for two Americas -- one where John Kerry can vote for something and another where he can vote against the same thing,'' Mr. Giuliani said at one point, drawing a huge roar from the crowd.
 It was the return of the combative, in-your-face mayor whom New Yorkers had come to know well, and whom the nation may be hearing more from.
 The last few weeks have been the highest public profile Mr. Giuliani has had since he left City Hall. His role as cheerleader-in-chief has fueled speculation that Mr. Giuliani hopes to emerge as the party's strongest presidential hopeful in 2008. Polls show that Mr. Giuliani has tremendous support among the party faithful and among voters nationwide, though he says it is too soon to begin thinking about 2008.
 ''I may run for office again, but I will wait until after this election to see what makes sense, what works, what do I want,'' Mr. Giuliani said in an interview before the speech. [Excerpts, Page P10.]
 But no matter who wins in November, there will be a crowded field of Republicans in 2008, not to mention another New Yorker who could be vying for the same contributor and voter base, Gov. George E. Pataki. So as Republicans renominate Mr. Bush to what would be a second and final term, the jockeying for a future shot at the presidency has already begun.
 That has led to signs, however subtle, of frustration among some Republicans at Mr. Giuliani's ability to sit on the sidelines and remain so popular. 
 ''Giuliani has a unique role in the country as a hero, as a strong leader and he has the added option of not having to vote on anything, which allows him to have very high approval ratings because he doesn't have to take tough positions,'' said Scott Reed, a Republican political strategist. ''He is about to face a fork in the road if he wants to run nationally: how he deals with the social and economic conservatives which are the base of the Republican Party.''
 The answer may begin with the Bush-Cheney campaign and the convention. Helping to re-elect Mr. Bush, and helping to promote a Republican agenda, can only help Mr. Giuliani with the party faithful. He worked hard last night to paint Mr. Bush as a strong, resolute leader, but also as a warm, sensitive human being.
 In his speech, Mr. Giuliani invoked images of the Sept. 11 terror attacks in a way that few political figures can. He laced his address with personal experiences, like when he saw a body plummet from the World Trade Center, and partisan attacks on the Democratic nominee, Mr. Giuliani touched on some of the most fundamental issues of the campaign. 
 Mr. Giuliani applauded the president's decision to invade Iraq, saying that Saddam Hussein was himself a ''weapon of mass destruction.'' He emphasized the themes of leadership and compassion, and he compared the president to the wartime British prime minister, Winston Churchill, and the last American president of the cold war, Ronald Reagan.
 In his remarks, he recalled how President Bush ''stood amid the fallen towers and said to the barbaric terrorists who attacked us, 'They will hear from us.'''
 He said they did hear from the United States in Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries that may now be reluctant to sponsor terrorism. To keep that campaign going, Mr. Giuliani said, the president must be re-elected. ''We owe that much to our loved ones and heroes we lost on Sept. 11,'' he said.
 Mr. Giuliani, more than anyone else, can talk about Sept. 11 in a political context, while simultaneously inoculating the Bush-Cheney ticket against accusations that it might be trying to exploit the national tragedy for political gain, political consultants said. 
 But Mr. Giuliani did more as well.
 With the race very close, and a few key states in play, Mr. Giuliani spoke last night to a potentially important swing vote, Jewish voters who see United States policy toward Israel as paramount. While small in numbers, they can play pivotal roles in places like Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, analysts said. 
 ''Terrorist acts became a ticket to the international bargaining table,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''How else to explain Yasser Arafat winning the Nobel Prize when he was supporting the plague of terrorism in the Middle East that undermine any chance of peace.''
 Mr. Giuliani, despite his harsh rhetoric, also served the convention as a symbol of moderation, which dovetailed with the dominant theme of the week. Republicans working to re-elect the president see the convention as a chance to win over undecided voters.
 Where Mr. Giuliani helps the most is with the central issue of the convention, and the campaign: leadership. In his remarks, Mr. Giuliani sought to imbue Mr. Bush with his own imprimatur, again recalling the day of the attacks.
 ''Without really thinking, based on just emotion, spontaneous, I grabbed the arm of then-Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik and said to him, 'Bernie, thank God George Bush is our president.'''

HEADLINE: Excerpt From McCain on Rightness of War

 BODY:
Following is an excerpt from Senator John McCain's speech last night to the Republican National Convention, as recorded by The New York Times. The full transcript and video are at nytimes.com/campaign.
 This week, millions of Americans, not all Republicans, will weigh our claim on their support for the two men who have led our country in these challenging times with moral courage and firm resolve.
 So I begin with the words of a great American from the other party, given at his party's convention in the year I was born. My purpose is not imitation, for I can't match his eloquence, but respect for the relevance in our time of his rousing summons to greatness of an earlier generation of Americans. 
 In a time of deep distress at home, as tyranny strangled the aspirations to liberty of millions, and as war clouds gathered in the East and West, Franklin Delano Roosevelt accepted his party's nomination by observing: ''There is a mysterious cycle in human events. To some generations much is given. Of other generations much is expected. This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.'' 
 The awful events of Sept. 11, 2001, declared a war we were vaguely aware of, but hadn't really comprehended how near the threat was, and how terrible were the plans of our enemies.
 It's a big thing, this war. It's a fight between a just regard for human dignity and a malevolent force that defiles an honorable religion by disputing God's love for every soul on earth. It's a fight between right and wrong, good and evil. And, my friends -- and my friends, should our enemies acquire for their arsenal the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons they seek, this war will become a much bigger thing. 
 So it is, whether we wished it or not, that we have come to the test of our generation, to our rendezvous with destiny. And much is expected of us. We are engaged in a hard struggle against a cruel and determined adversary. Our enemies have made clear the danger they pose to our security and to the very essence of our culture: liberty.
 Only the most deluded of us could doubt the necessity of this war. Like all wars, this one will have its ups and downs. But we must fight. We must. 
 The sacrifices borne in our defense are not shared equally by all Americans. But all Americans must share a resolve to see this war through to a just end. We must not be complacent at moments of success, and we must not despair over setbacks. We must learn from our mistakes, improve on our successes and vanquish this unpardonable enemy.
 If we do less, we will fail the one mission no American generation has ever failed -- to provide to our children a stronger, better country than the one we were blessed to inherit. 
 You remember how we felt when the serenity of a bright September morning was destroyed by a savage atrocity so hostile to all human virtue we could scarcely imagine any human being capable of it. We were united. First, in sorrow and anger. Then in recognition we were attacked not for a wrong we had done, but for who we are -- a nation united in a kinship of ideals, committed to the notion that the people are sovereign, not governments, not armies, not a pitiless theocracy, not kings, mullahs or tyrants, but the people.
 In that moment, we were not different races. We were not poor or rich. We were not Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative. We were not two countries. We were Americans. 
 All of us, despite the differences that enliven our politics, are united in the one big idea that freedom is our birthright and its defense is always our first responsibility. All other responsibilities come second.
 We must not lose sight of that as we debate among us who should bear the greatest responsibility for keeping us safe and free. We must, whatever our disagreements, stick together in this great challenge of our time.
 My friends in the Democratic Party -- and I'm fortunate to call many of them my friends -- assure us they share the conviction that winning the war against terrorism is our government's most important obligation.
 I don't doubt their sincerity.
 They emphasize that military action alone won't protect us, that this war has many fronts: in courts, financial institutions, in the shadowy world of intelligence and in diplomacy.
 They stress that America needs the help of her friends to combat an evil that threatens us all, that our alliances are as important to victory as are our armies. 
 We agree.
 And, as we've been a good friend to other countries in moments of shared perils, so we have good reason to expect their solidarity with us in this struggle. 
 That is what the president believes. That is what the president believes. And thanks to his efforts, we have received valuable assistance from many good friends around the globe, even if we have, at times, been disappointed with the reactions of some.
 I don't doubt the sincerity of my Democratic friends. And they should not doubt ours.
 Our president -- our president will work with all nations willing to help us defeat this scourge that afflicts us all.
 War is an awful business. The lives of a nation's finest patriots are sacrificed. Innocent people suffer. Commerce is disrupted, economies are damaged. Strategic interests shielded by years of statecraft are endangered as the demands of war and diplomacy conflict.
 However just the cause, we should mourn for all that is lost when war claims its wages from us. But there is no avoiding this war. We tried that, and our reluctance cost us dearly. And while this war has many components, we can't make victory on the battlefield harder to achieve so that our diplomacy is easier to conduct.
 This is not just an expression of strength. It is a measure of our wisdom.
 That's why I commend to my country the re-election of President Bush, and the steady, experienced, public-spirited man who serves as our vice president, Dick Cheney.

LENGTH: 1267 words

HEADLINE: Social Conservatives Wield Influence on Platform

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
Republicans approved a platform yesterday that puts the party firmly on the record against legalized abortion, gay marriage and other forms of legal recognition for same-sex couples, reflecting the political clout of social conservatives and setting up a stark contrast with the Democrats for the fall campaign.
 The platform also hails President Bush's fight against terrorism, advocates making his tax cuts permanent and calls for the creation of personal investment accounts in Social Security as part of a new ''ownership society'' that Republicans assert will give Americans more responsibility and control over their financial lives. 
 The 93-page document, produced under the tight control of the Bush forces, tries to accomplish several political tasks: promoting and defending Mr. Bush's record, particularly on national security; sketching a domestic vision for a second term; and energizing the party's conservative base. 
 Democrats and their allies immediately denounced the platform as extremist and at odds with the moderate image the party is trying to project this week.
 ''It's the truth behind the facade of their convention,'' said Stephanie Cutter, spokeswoman for Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee. ''It reflects the divisiveness and extreme policies of the last four years, while the public speakers paint a very different picture.''
 Gay rights and abortion rights groups restated their dismay. Cheryl Jacques, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization, declared, ''It's one of the most discriminatory platforms in modern history.'' She added, of Mr. Bush, ''He's counting on the fact that most people won't be reading the letter of the law of the Republican platform.''
 Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader and chairman of the Republican platform committee, hailed the platform, titled, ''A Safer World, A More Hopeful America,'' as a tribute to Mr. Bush when he presented it to the convention yesterday.
 ''Our platform highlights the principles that unite our party,'' Mr. Frist said. ''We stand squarely, fully and firmly with President George W. Bush in a time of profound national and historic consequence.''
 Reflecting the altered world since the last Republican platform was written four years ago in Philadelphia, half of the document is devoted to national security, and what it asserts are Mr. Bush's sweeping achievements in the fight against terrorism. ''The president's leadership has achieved successes once deemed impossible to realize in so short a time,'' it declares. 
 Hailing the president's ''steadfast resolve'' in response to the attacks of Sept. 11, the platform declares: ''There is no negotiation with terrorists. No form of therapy or coercion will turn them from their murderous ways. Only total and compete destruction of terrorism will allow freedom to flourish.''
 The platform also describes the war with Iraq, which brought hundreds of thousands of protesters to the streets of New York this week, as justified and successful. ''Iraq, which once had the worst government in the Middle East, is now becoming an example of reform to the region,'' it says. 
 Republicans also used the platform to promote the ownership society and ''reformed'' government that are expected to be a highlight of Mr. Bush's speech Thursday night as he tries to offer a conservative approach to such bread and butter issues as retirement and health care. 
 Mr. Kerry has proposed rolling back the Bush tax cuts for those making more than $200,000 a year and using the money for new health care initiatives. The Republican platform echoes Mr. Bush and says the cuts must be made permanent. ''We believe that good government is based on a system of limited taxes and spending,'' it says. ''The taxation system should not be used to redistribute wealth or fund ever-increasing entitlements and social programs.''
 The platform describes the current deficit of $445 billion as ''unwelcome but manageable,'' and argues that it should be reduced by cutting spending, not limiting tax cuts. 
 Republicans also called once again for ''strengthening Social Security with ownership,'' allowing workers to direct part of their payroll taxes to personal investment accounts. Critics assert that the transition costs of such partial privatization would be huge because tax revenues would be diverted from the Social Security system into the private accounts.
 The Democratic platform declares that the party opposes the creation of private accounts that are ''subject to the whims of the market or the economy.''
 Party platforms are not binding on a candidate, but are generally considered a snapshot of the party's ideological and political imperatives in an election year. The current platform shows the critical role that social conservatives are playing in the Republican Party as it heads into an extremely competitive race in which each party must turn out its core supporters.
 On abortion, the Republican Party restates its longstanding commitment to a constitutional ban and an end to legal abortion. It hails Mr. Bush for signing and defending the ''Partial Birth Abortion Act'' -- a ban on a type of second and third trimester abortions. That law was recently held unconstitutional by two federal courts.
 Social conservatives, who pushed Mr. Bush to endorse a federal constitutional amendment against gay marriage earlier this year, pushed for even stronger language in the platform, and succeeded. Mr. Bush has indicated that he embraced a constitutional amendment opposing same-sex marriage only as a last resort to prevent courts from deciding the issue and said that states should be free to recognize same-sex civil unions or domestic partnerships. But the platform, as amended by the conservatives on the platform committee, condemns not only gay marriage but also state recognition of other same-sex unions as well.
 At a news conference yesterday, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a group of social conservatives, said that the push to strengthen the platform's opposition to same-sex civil unions was partly a response to Vice President Dick Cheney's statement last week that he personally favored leaving the issue up to the states. 
 ''We are obviously troubled by the vice president's comments last week, which in ways led to the strengthening of the language in the platform,'' Mr. Perkins said. 
 Mr. Kerry has said he opposes gay marriage, but also opposes a constitutional ban on it. The Democratic platform declares, ''Marriage has been defined at the state level for 200 years and we believe it should continue to be defined there.'' 
 Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, said Republicans were divided on the importance of the gay marriage issue, with only a third of Republicans who are not evangelicals describing it as a top voting priority, versus nearly three-fourths of the Republican evangelicals.
 On another volatile issue, the platform applauds the president's decision to restrict federal financing for research using embryonic stem cells. Again, some conservatives tried to call for additional restrictions on privately financed research, but Dr. Frist, a close ally of the White House and a medical doctor, fought off that effort.
 In a gesture to moderates, the Republican platform added a ''unity plank,'' acknowledging that party members of good will might disagree. But the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, and Republicans for Choice faulted the plank for failing to specify the divisive social issues: abortion, stem-cell research and same-sex marriage.

P4)Chart: ''Excerpts From the Party Platforms''The war in IraqRepublican PlatformAs Republicans, we do not equivocate, as others have done, about whether America should have gone to war in Iraq. The best intelligence available at the time indicated that Saddam Hussein was a threat. On that point, President Bush, members of both parties in Congress, and the United Nations agreed. While the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction we expected to find in Iraq have not yet materialized, we have confirmed that Saddam Hussein had the capability to reconstitute his weapons programs and the desire to do so. ... President Bush had a choice to make: Trust a madman or defend America. He chose defending America.Democratic PlatformPeople of good will disagree about whether America should have gone to war in Iraq, but this much is clear: this administration badly exaggerated its case, particularly with respect to weapons of mass destruction and the connection between Saddam's government and Al Qaeda. This administration did not build a true international coalition. This administration disdained the United Nations weapons inspection process and rushed to war without exhausting diplomatic alternatives. Ignoring the advice of military leaders, this administration did not send sufficient forces into Iraq to accomplish the mission.Tax cutsRepublican PlatformWe believe that good government is based on a system of limited taxes and spending. Furthermore, we believe that the federal government should be limited and restricted to the functions mandated by the United States Constitution. The taxation system should not be used to redistribute wealth or fund ever-increasing entitlements and social programs. ... Our party endorses the president's proposals to make tax relief permanent, so that families and businesses can plan for the future with confidence.Democratic PlatformFirst, we must restore our values to our tax code. We want a tax code that rewards work and creates wealth for more people, not a tax code that hoards wealth for those who already have it. With the middle class under assault like never before, we simply cannot afford the massive Bush tax cuts for the very wealthiest. We should set taxes for families making more than $200,000 a year at the same level as in the late 1990's, a period of great prosperity when the wealthiest Americans thrived without special treatment.Gay marriageRepublican PlatformWe strongly support President Bush's call for a constitutional amendment that fully protects marriage, and we believe that neither federal nor state judges nor bureaucrats should force states to recognize other living arrangements as equivalent to marriage. We believe, and the social science confirms, that the well-being of children is best accomplished in the environment of the home, nurtured by their mother and father anchored by the bonds of marriage.Democratic PlatformWe support full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation and seek equal responsibilities, benefits, and protections for these families. In our country, marriage has been defined at the state level for 200 years, and we believe it should continue to be defined there. We repudiate President Bush's divisive effort to politicize the Constitution by pursuing a Federal Marriage Amendment. Our goal is to bring Americans together, not drive them apart.AbortionRepublican PlatformWe say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the 14th Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions.Democratic PlatformBecause we believe in the privacy and equality of women, we stand proudly for a woman's right to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, and regardless of her ability to pay. We stand firmly against Republican efforts to undermine that right. At the same time, we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives. Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.Stem cell researchRepublican PlatformWe especially welcome and encourage a stronger emphasis on adult stem cell and cord blood stem cell research. ... We recognize that President Bush made a carefully considered decision to allow federal funding for stem cell research for the first time, and did not affect stem cell research in the private sector. We strongly support the president's policy that prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to encourage the future destruction of human embryos.Democratic PlatformPresident Bush has rejected the calls from Nancy Reagan, Christopher Reeve and Americans across the land for assistance with embryonic stem cell research. We will reverse his wrongheaded policy. ... We will pursue this research under the strictest ethical guidelines, but we will not walk away from the chance to save lives and reduce human suffering.

He's a Diplomat, Not a Strategist
 ''NO, I'm not the next Karl Rove,'' Eric Hoplin, the chairman of the College Republican National Committee, insisted yesterday, moments before the real Karl Rove was to address a gathering of the student organization's leaders in a wood-paneled bar on 39th Street. ''But I do share a couple of distinctions with Karl.''
 Mr. Hoplin, an apple-cheeked, 26-year-old in blue oxford-cloth shirt and gold tie, is the first person since Mr. Rove to ascend from executive director to chairman of the group. 
 While the real Mr. Rove is busy telling reporters he is not President Bush's brain, Mr. Hoplin did not seem entirely convinced.
 ''I don't know,'' Mr. Hoplin said, before quickly turning the conversation in a more diplomatic direction. ''Here's what I do know: The president is a smart man. He's a strong leader.'' 
 And Mr. Rove? ''Karl is brilliant,'' he said.
 But Mr. Hoplin seems to be no slouch himself. When Mr. Rove ran the College Republicans, the group operated as an arm of the National Republican Committee, which gave it a budget of $100,000. With the new campaign finance rules, Mr. Hoplin said, he decided to split off from the national party. Now a separate entity, the College Republicans expect to raise $10 million this year.
 But unlike his predecessor, Mr. Hoplin says he has no plans to work behind the scenes as a political mastermind. ''I'm going to run for office,'' he said.
 If he needs a good strategist, he knows where to find one.

Here, Conservatives Have Many Slots
 WHILE the Republicans were throwing up their big tent in Madison Square Garden, a little tent was pitched yesterday across the street at the New Yorker Hotel in a stuffy suite festooned with posters of Ronald Reagan. There, a group of conservatives celebrated the publication of a new book, ''Thank You, President Bush,'' featuring essays by notables like John Ashcroft, Phyllis Schlafly and Ed Meese.
 ''We are the Republican wing of the Republican Party,'' proclaimed Richard Engle, president of the National Federation of Republican Assemblies, which was co-host of the event. ''Our intent is to see to it that the concepts, the ideals and the principles of the Republican platform are enacted into public policy.''
 You wouldn't know that by what's going on inside the Garden this week, where some of the hottest speakers -- Rudolph W. Giuliani, John McCain, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the like -- are not exactly sporting a red letter C on their lapels. The heavy representation of moderates in the convention lineup has not made people like Mr. Engle happy, but at the book reception, the conservatives were trying to make the best of it.
 ''We're not left out at all,'' insisted Star Parker, the former welfare mother turned Christian social commentator who is a contributor to the book. ''It's not about who's speaking to America. It's what the party stands for.''
 Stephen Moore, who runs the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group, and is also a contributor, tried hard to be equally sanguine. ''Do you think the Democrats would ever let someone who is pro-life speak at their convention?'' he asked before dashing into the book party. 
 But not everyone was so chipper. William J. Federer, the Republican candidate who is trying to win the Missouri seat held by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the former House Democratic leader, said Republican strategists were making a mistake. Mr. Federer is the author of several books, including ''Three Secular Reasons Why America Should Be Under God'' and ''America's God and Country Encyclopedia of Quotations.'' 
 Asked why he thought the moderates had such a hold on the speakers' slots, Mr. Federer offered a two-word answer that may not endear him to the Republican powers that be: ''political posturing.''

A Moderate Who Went Too Far
 NO one expects the Republican moderates to defy party leaders by advocating abortion rights from the Garden stage. Christine Todd Whitman once did, and it wasn't pretty.
 ''I was to give one of those four-minute throwaway speeches,'' Ms. Whitman, the former governor of New Jersey and former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said yesterday, recalling the year, 1996, when she was co-chairwoman of the Republican convention with then-Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. 
 She continued: ''I included a line to the effect of -- I don't remember the exact words -- that 'even though we may disagree on issues such as choice,' and I ran into enormous push back from people who didn't want that line in there. We took it out of the formal speech; I ad-libbed it in.''
 The response? Some delegates ''stood up and turned their backs.''
 The lesson? ''If we're going to be a national party,'' Ms. Whitman said, ''we can't be about excluding people.''

Of Marriage Vows And No-Tax Pledges
 WHY, at the tender age of 47, did Grover G. Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and the scourge of tax-raising legislators on Capitol Hill, finally decide to get married?
 ''I signed up because I was promised there was a tax credit involved,'' Mr. Norquist said yesterday, standing with his fiancee, Samah Alrayyes, 31. ''Was I misinformed?''
 Mr. Norquist was getting ready to celebrate the legislators who have signed his group's no-tax pledge at the kind of place where a tax cut comes in handy: the New York Yacht Club. He dismissed the idea that the venue might confirm Democratic stereotypes about Republicans.
 ''The Democrats always talk about rich Republicans, but there are always more furs and Cadillacs at their events,'' said Mr. Norquist, who announced his engagement at one of his recent Wednesday meetings, the weekly strategy session of the Washington conservative establishment. 
 As much as Mr. Norquist approved of President Bush's tax cuts, he said he wanted to hear about new topics in the president's speech on Thursday night.
 ''What he has to do in the speech,'' Mr. Norquist suggested, ''is say, Here's what we did, and we were right and they were wrong, and then pivot quickly around to the future. You don't get re-elected as a thank-you. ''
 Miss Alrayyes, a public affairs officer at the United States Agency for International Development, said she too was a Republican believer in tax relief, though that did not guide her marital choice. 
 Under prodding, Mr. Norquist conceded that a tax credit hadn't really guided his decision either.
 ''No,'' he said, giving her a hug and kiss, ''it wasn't about a tax credit. I would have done it even if it was just a deduction.' 

Lessons Learned At the Convention
 SOME things we learned yesterday: 
 Arthur B. Laffer, the guru of supply-side economics, voted for Bill Clinton twice. ''Clinton was the single most conservative president I have ever seen,'' the former adviser to President Ronald Reagan said, speaking of Mr. Clinton's economic policies. But the 64-year-old Dr. Laffer quickly added that Mr. Reagan really made his heart flutter. Speaking to a gathering of Bush supporters, he called Mr. Reagan ''the real president.'' 
 Senator John McCain didn't mean to insult Michael Moore in person. ''I had no idea he was sitting there,'' the senator said after his reference to the ''disingenuous filmmaker'' brought the house down on Monday night. But then who knew disingenuous was a red meat word?
 Republicans are psychedelic, man. The giant graphics that kept popping up on the screen last night looked like an unfortunate sequel to ''Yellow Submarine.'' When Ed Gillespie, the Republican National Committee chairman, spoke, an enormous electric-blue elephant appeared behind him, raising and lowering its trunk as if it were whacking him on the head. Maybe it was a message from all those disenchanted conservatives.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy to Iraq Urges Shift of Money to Security

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; John F. Burns contributed reporting from Baghdad for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The new American ambassador in Iraq, concerned about the problems of unemployed Iraqis and by attacks on the country's oil fields, has urged the Bush administration to shift money away from infrastructure improvements and use it to improve security and job opportunities, Bush administration officials said Monday.
 The officials said that under a proposal submitted last week by the ambassador, John D. Negroponte, more than $3.3 billion in aid that had been set aside for improvements in Iraq's utilities, electricity, water and sewage needed to be spent for other purposes to show quickly results that could be seen by discontented Iraqis.
 The recommended policy shift, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is to be discussed at an interagency meeting as early as this week. Administration officials said that Mr. Negroponte's suggestions also would have to be discussed with budget officials in Congress, which appropriated $18 billion for Iraq's reconstruction last year. 
 The Negroponte recommendation was seen in the administration as a sign of the State Department moving to take control of the nonmilitary agenda in Iraq. During the occupation, which ended June 28, officials at the State Department were incensed over being sidelined by Defense Department officials then in charge of reconstruction.
 ''The recommendations are the result of a review that Negroponte began even before he arrived in Baghdad,'' a State Department official said. ''He's reached the conclusion that a lot of the infrastructure improvements that Iraq needs simply cannot go forward unless the security situation is improved.''
 Of the money proposed to be shifted, $1.8 billion is to help pay for 45,000 new Iraqi police officers, 16,000 new border patrol officers, 99 new border outposts and an additional 20 Iraqi National Guard battalions. A battalion is about 1,000 people. On top of these expenditures, money is proposed for training and equipment. 
 Another $140 million would be used to provide assistance for elections that are to be held at the end of this year or the beginning of the next. The United Nations is supposed to be in charge of arranging for the elections, but an administration official said there was a growing feeling the United Nations may not have the resources to do the job.
 At the time of the American transfer of power to a newly sovereign government in Iraq in late June, American officials said one of their greatest disappointments during the occupation after the ouster of Saddam Hussein was the failure to be able to spend reconstruction funds rapidly enough.
 Of the $18 billion appropriated by Congress following the end of major combat, only about $600 million had actually been spent on contracts with companies hired to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure. 
 As a result, just before the transfer of power, the occupation shifted $2.5 billion in Iraqi oil revenues, which were nominally under control of the Iraqi oil and finance ministries, to construction projects that would provide a quick payoff to Iraqis increasingly skeptical about American intentions.
 On a visit to Baghdad during the summer, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told Americans at the new embassy that he wanted a thorough review of procedures on spending. Aides to Mr. Powell said that more specifically, he wanted to know why there had been so many delays.
 Administration officials say the delays were a result of many factors, including cumbersome contracting regulations imposed by the Congress and a heightened sensitivity over the fact that early in the occupation several contracts were awarded without competitive bidding to the Halliburton Company, once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.
 When they went into Iraq, many administration development experts approached the aid programs in a traditional way. The idea was that improvements to power generation capacity, electricity lines, water and sewage would be ''precursors for larger economic investments'' down the road, an administration official said.
 But that view did not take into account the problems arising from the spread of the anti-American insurgency. Rebels were also attacking oil fields, making it clear that without security it made little sense to keep spending money to improve oil production equipment.
 In Baghdad, a senior military commander said Monday that some of the newly shifted money could be spent in unstable parts of the country, such as the section of Baghdad known as Sadr City, where supporters of Moktada al-Sadr are able to keep their insurgency going because of local anger at the failures of the American presence.
 The commander said that while it would be ''wonderful'' to clean up the banks of the Tigris River, as originally envisioned by some American planners, it was much more urgent to clean up local sewers and get jobs for the people firing rocket-propelled grenades at American troops.
 ''Right now it's not long-term projects that matter,'' the commander said. ''What matters is cleaning up Ahmed's sewer.'' 
 The American effort is to be supervised in coming weeks by William B. Taylor Jr., a State Department diplomat who until recently oversaw the reconstruction and plans for elections in Afghanistan. In the 1990's, Mr. Taylor was involved in similar projects in the Balkans.
 American officials in Washington and Baghdad say their priority now is to stabilize as much of the country as possible in order to clear the way for the elections. Elections for a constitutional convention are to take place in December or January.

HEADLINE: Suncor Energy Is Turning Canadian Tar Into Energy

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: FORT McMURRAY, Alberta 

 BODY:
From the moment that Suncor Energy's sleek corporate jet takes off from Calgary each morning, it is obvious that the plane is headed for a boom town. What was once one of the sleepiest corners of Canada's energy industry is going through a spurt of frenetic development. 
 The geologists, roughnecks and recently minted M.B.A.'s being ferried north by the Suncor jet are all focused on one objective: an unconventional approach to producing oil by sucking the viscous tar out of the sandy soil around Fort McMurray, a city of 50,000 where the temperature can dip to 40 degrees below zero in the winter. 
 It is not easy and it is not cheap, and through most of the 1980's and 1990's, it was not attractive to pursue, because there was plenty of crude oil available from more convenient sources and the market price was too low to reward large-scale tar sands development.
 Both sides of the equation have now changed. North America's crude oil resources have been so thoroughly explored and developed that experts say there is hardly any left to find, except perhaps in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In the rest of the world, most of the best places to drill for new oil are off limits to the Western energy industry for political reasons, and existing fields are already pumping every barrel they can. 
 So, with roaring global demand driving energy prices up to record levels over the last few years and fresh supplies of crude oil so hard to find, Suncor and more than a dozen other energy companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco and Royal Dutch/Shell, are pursuing projects here. 
 Their output is already crucial to the United States' energy supply. The flow of oil extracted from Alberta's tar sands, also called oil sands, surpassed one million barrels a day at the end of 2003, and it is expected to double to two million barrels by 2010, matching the output of significant members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries like Libya and Indonesia. Much of the oil goes south across the American border.
 Yet while the United States deepens its reliance on Canadian energy -- Canada is already the country's largest supplier of both oil and natural gas, ahead of Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela -- the frenzy of tar sands development in Alberta highlights an uncomfortable fact about the search for unconventional sources of oil to replace dwindling conventional supplies: it depends on petroleum prices staying high for decades to come. 
 Energy economists in Calgary, the freewheeling commercial capital of this sparsely populated but energy-rich province of three million, say that most tar sands projects are viable only when oil is selling for more than $30 a barrel. [Light low-sulfur crude for October delivery settled in New York yesterday at $42.28 a barrel, down 90 cents for the day.] 
 It often costs as much as $15 a barrel to get bitumen, a thick, sticky form of crude oil, out of the sands, compared with recovery costs as low as $2 a barrel for crude oil in parts of the Middle East. Refining the bitumen also costs much more than refining light crude. Many energy companies ignored the sands when light crude was fetching just $10 a barrel in the late 1990's, but no longer. 
 ''The attractiveness for a country like the U.S. is that we're right next door, politically stable and friendly to private enterprise,'' said Peter Tertzakian, chief energy economist at ARC Financial, a Calgary investment firm. ''The downside is that it's costly to produce, and open to criticism from environmentalists, who view the oil sands as a great polluter.'' 
 Anywhere in the world, of course, it takes energy to produce energy. But tar sands operations are especially voracious, consuming about 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas to convert a barrel of bitumen into the light crude that refiners want. 
 Every cubic foot of gas used to support oil production around Fort McMurray is one less that Canada can export to the United States, where gas, too, is in short supply. The rapid run-up in demand here was cited last year by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, as one reason that natural gas prices remain high in the United States. 
 Suncor's operations offer a glimpse of how great an undertaking it is to produce oil here. The company, based in Calgary, was a pioneer in oil sands exploration in the 1960's, but it has been in only the last few years that its growing production made it influential in the North American oil industry. Its oil sands output averaged 248,000 barrels a day last month. Suncor recently acquired a refinery in Denver capable of processing the oil so it can be sold throughout the United States. 
 Most of Suncor's production comes from an operation resembling an immense open-pit mine. Huge Caterpillar and Komatsu dump trucks weighing 240 tons or more carry loads of soil scooped out of the earth with large shovels. The trucks and shovels run around the clock throughout the year, barreling over the frozen soil in winter and struggling through the sticky sand in the summer. 
 Suncor's management, led by its Colorado-raised chief executive, Richard L. George, emphasizes productivity in a push to bring down recovery costs. Interruptions are expensive: halting a dump truck costs the company as much as $50 a minute. 
 Employees at the mine, bused out daily from Fort McMurray, normally work six consecutive 12-hour days, then have six days off; starting pay is about 25 Canadian dollars (about $19) an hour. The rapid development of the oil sands has brought thousands of newcomers to Fort McMurray and pushed up housing prices to some of the highest in Canada: one-bedroom apartments rent for 1,300 Canadian dollars or more a month, and single-family homes average more than 300,000 Canadian dollars.
 ''After high school, I moved away, but the money brought me back,'' said Cynthia Deutsch, 29, a truck driver and a rare born-and-bred McMurrayite. Ms. Deutsch also said that she liked the view from the cab of her 360-ton truck. 
 Once drivers like Ms. Deutsch deliver the soil to the crushing machines, hot water is used to separate the bitumen from the sand, in a process not unlike an old-fashioned butter churn. It generally takes about two tons of sand to yield one barrel of oil. Different methods are used at projects where the bitumen is extracted underground. 
 So much natural gas and electricity is used to run machinery and melt away mud that the oil sands operations have become significant contributors to Canada's total emissions of global-warming gases. Since Canada endorsed the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, committing it to reduce such emissions, energy companies here have taken steps like investing in emission-reducing technology and buying ''carbon credits.'' 
 Suncor, for instance, has become one of Canada's largest developers of wind-generated electricity, and it has acquired tracts of rain forest in Belize to protect them from clearing and logging, offsetting the effects of its tar sands operations, according to Brad Bellows, a company spokesman. 
 Environmentalist critics say such efforts are little more than window dressing and do nothing to relieve North America's dependence on oil. 
 ''They're turning silk purses into sows' ears, rather than the other way around,'' said Thomas Adams, executive director of Energy Probe, a Toronto-based group that promotes energy conservation. ''Those who think this is the Saudi Arabia of the month are bound for a shock.'' 
 Environmentalists are not the only tar sands skeptics. Some of the major oil companies, like BP, have steered clear, noting that for nearly a century, attempt after attempt to extract heavy oil from the sands on a commercial scale foundered, littering the area around Fort McMurray with abandoned technologies. The city even has a museum with old equipment, the Oil Sands Discovery Center, on the outskirts of town. 
 Yet many in the oil industry are betting that the tar sands moment really has arrived this time. 
 According to the Athabasca Regional Issues Working Group, an organization representing energy companies, some 28 billion Canadian dollars in oil sands investments are planned over the next decade. By next year, the sands are expected to account for half of Canada's crude oil output and about 10 percent of overall oil production in North America. 
 The believers received a boost last year when statisticians at the United States Department of Energy started counting oil sands in their estimates of Canada's oil reserves, raising them more than thirtyfold at a stroke, to 180 billion barrels from 4.9 billion. That vaulted Canada to second in the world rankings, behind Saudi Arabia. 
 The other country with significant known bitumen reserves is Venezuela, but its efforts to step up oil production have been hindered in recent years by internal political tensions. Suncor, in fact, has begun recruiting Venezuelan technicians who are familiar with bitumen technology and who lost jobs at the Venezuelan state oil company when President Hugo Chavez moved to purge his political opponents from its ranks. 
 Other analysts have also begun to see promise in oil sands, despite the widespread view that traditional oil wildcatting is still more profitable. Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm, noted in a recent report that internal rates of return on oil sands projects average 13.6 percent, compared with 33.4 percent for offshore oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico and 18.2 percent in the waters off West Africa, which are also attracting large amounts of new investment. But while production in those areas is expected to peak in a decade or so, the oil sands are expected to remain robust for 30 years or more. 
 The oil sands have transformed Fort McMurray, whose population has quintupled since 1970. It now has its own Harley-Davidson dealership, even though it is far too cold here to ride a motorcycle for much of the year. Fast-food restaurants and other service companies have trouble keeping workers, who quickly jump to the oil sands whenever jobs open up. A local outlet of the Tim Hortons coffee and baked goods chain displays a sign promising help in paying health benefits, free meals, free uniforms and paid training. 
 Typically for an oil boom town, most of Fort McMurray's new residents are men. The marquee over the doors of the Oil Sands Hotel advertises a telling range of services: check cashing, gambling with slot machines, and ''4 exotic dancers.''
 The political risks associated with the oil sands would seem to be tiny compared with volatile places like the Middle East or Venezuela. But that does not mean that the oil boom here has come without revealing a bit of tension between prosperous Alberta and the rest of Canada. 
 Ralph Klein, the premier of Alberta, said in July that surging royalty payments from oil and natural gas production would allow the province to pay off all its debt by next spring, even as it continues to forward revenue to the national government to support social spending in other parts of the country. 
 Resentment over those payments has led to a few calls from fringe groups for Alberta to secede from Canada, or at least to collect its own income taxes, organize its own pension plan and replace the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with a provincial police force. 
 Though far-fetched, such ideas are not entirely foreign to those engaged in the race for oil here.
 ''Our political guys just like to remind the rest of the country where the money comes from every once in a while,'' said Brenda Erskine, a director for community relations for Suncor in Fort McMurray.
