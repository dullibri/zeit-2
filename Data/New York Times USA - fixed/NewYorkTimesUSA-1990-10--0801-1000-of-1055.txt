HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Providing Some Guidelines On Campaigns for Children

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
ADVERTISING to children is anything but child's play, and the Children's Television Workshop, which produces the "Sesame Street" television show and a number of children's magazines, wants to help advertisers learn the ropes.
This help for advertisers, offered at a meeting on marketing to children sponsored by General Foods, comes when a number of critics say some advertising to children is practically a form of child abuse. Congress last week restricted the amount of advertising allowed on children's television programming, and some consumer advocates and lawmakers are seeking stricter limits on what can be advertised to children and when.
"We've been trying to help set the standards for advertising to children," said Dr. Renee O'Leary, the director of research for the Children's Television Workshop. "Depending on their age, children have varying abilities to discriminate about advertising and that makes them very vulnerable."
The Children's Television Workshop, a not-for-profit organization based in Manhattan, has an interest in helping advertisers. It accepts advertising for its magazines, which include 3-2-1 Contact, Kid City and a Sesame Street parents' guide. The Sesame Street show, which is broadcast on public television, does not accept ads.
"Children change so quickly, the only way to know what appeals to them and what they will understand is to continually talk to them," Dr. O'Leary said in a recent interview.
Her research has found that in some ways, children are more sophisticated than many people would imagine. A recent survey of children 6 to 10 years old found they were concerned about the possibility of war in the Middle East, AIDS, crime and the economy, as well as the lastest adventures of the Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles. Most considered the environment the most important issue.
Dr. O'Leary cautioned that advertisers should not try to appeal to children by trying to be hip. Ads that show children who have "super cool" spiked hair and clothing to match may misfire. "Children generally aren't as hip as the media makes them out to be," she said. "We've found they aren't growing up faster today than in the past."
Using the slang common to rap music lyrics may also be a mistake. Dr. O'Leary said that surveys found that children like rap music because of the beat, but many have no idea what the lyrics are about.
Children also have a hard time understanding ads that rely on parody. They usually do not get the joke at first, Dr. O'Leary said, and when they finally do, they feel betrayed. She said it was generally best to signal children that there was a joke. "Irony won't work on a lot of children," she said. "They take things too literally because they're trying to figure life out."
When it comes to print ads, the simplest approach is often the best, she said. The company's research has found that many children are intimidated by large blocks of type and complicated layouts.
The company's researchers also found that the growing use of so-called kids' clubs in ads -- like the one for Burger King -- may create problems because it can take unfair advantage of most children's natural tendency to want to feel they belong.
Not surprisingly, the images children respond to most readily are cartoons, Dr. O'Leary said. But studies found that what is even more appealing to most children is a combination of cartoon and real-life images. "They like the mix because it's like their lives," Dr. O'Leary said, "a combination of the real and the imaginary."

Who Will Pay For the Big One?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE earthquake that slammed through the San Francisco Bay area in October 1989 killed 62 people and destroyed $5 billion worth of property. The next time the earth's giant tectonic plates slip a few yards, both people and property may be at far greater risk.
By Government estimates, a quake hitting the wrong place at the wrong time of day could kill up to 95,000 and leave a $100 billion cleanup bill. Los Angeles and San Francisco are prime targets, of course. But the peril is hardly confined to California: the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that Seattle, Salt Lake City, Memphis and Charleston, S.C., are also at "major" risk.
If the Big One hits -- make that "when" it hits -- who will pay? Even in California, relatively few property owners are covered by earthquake insurance. But Robert E. Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution, estimates that damage from quake-related fires and injuries could still result in up to $50 billion in insurance claims. Honoring these claims, he argues, could severely deplete insurers' reserves, driving some into bankruptcy and turning others into risk-taking zombies.
Mr. Litan's preferred fix, described in the latest edition of The Brookings Review: mandatory Federal earthquake insurance, with premiums set to cover actuarial risks.
Just one California property owner in four carries earthquake insurance; nationwide, the figure is below one in 20. If such insurance is available and most people choose not to buy it, why should the Government insist?
One reason, Mr. Litan suggests, is that the private market overprices the product. Only those atgreatest risk currently buy coverage, and insurers are apparently unwilling or unable to attract lower-risk customers with lower premiums.
Another reason is that owners have insufficient incentives to pay for insurance because the Federal Government stands ready to reimburse them for a portion of their losses. American taxpayers, Mr. Litan reckons, shelled out $17 each for disaster relief in last year's San Francisco quake.
Uncle Sam could play hardball, giving legal notice that in the future the Treasury would help only those who help themselves. But the threat would probably not be credible: Americans are no more likely to deny relief to uninsured victims of an earthquake than they are to deny medical care to injured motorcylists who did not wear helmets.
A third and perhaps most compelling reason is that casualty insurers are poorly geared to bear the earthquake risks already on their books. A not unlikely $50 billion hit, Mr. Litan calculates, would drain the industry of about 40 percent of total reserves. Some insurers would go bankrupt; others would be forced to raise rates sharply to meetregulatory requirements.
The process might be manageable in theory, but would certainly be problematic in practice. Mr. Litan, a longtime analyst of the savings and loan debacle, worries that earthquake losses would be injurious to the casualty insurers' financial health, much the way the interest rate squeeze of the early 1980's started savings and loan associations down the path to collective ruin.
When faced with the alternative of double-digit premium increases, he believes, vote-conscious regulators might allow insurance companies to operate with low (or negative) net worths. And once insurers were deep in a financial hole, they would have powerful incentives to generate premium revenues by taking ever greater chances.
Mr. Litan favors legislation that would effectively require anyone who wanted a home mortgage to buy Federal earthquake coverage. The bill, sponsored by Representative Al Swift, a Washington Democrat, and David Dreier, a California Republican, would set premiums according to actuarial risk. Buildings designed or modified to minimize quake damage would get a break on rates.
The average premium in California for a no-deductible policy, Mr. Litan believes, would run between $104 and $194. In Memphis and Charleston, the same coverage would run from $15 to $28.
Federal earthquake insurance would still leave private insurers with enormous exposure to quake-related claims for fire, disability and death losses. The Swift-Dreier bill would cover the gap with Federal reinsurance, giving private insurers years to spread the costs across their premium base.
Federal involvement is no panacea. If Washington's record in insuring farm crops is a precedent, setting premiums at actuarily sound levels would prove very difficult. But one way or another, Mr. Litan argues, Washington is going to bear a lot of the cost of the Big One. Any step that forces property owners to protect themselves is probably a step in the right direction.

HEADLINE: In Lean Times, Caterers Trim Parties to Fit

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
AT a black-tie benefit at the Plaza Hotel last week, a $750 ticket bought a three-course dinner featuring beef Bourgignon, a dish also known as stew; at the same March of Dimes benefit last year, the same price brought four courses, including salmon and duck.
Also this month, a group of formally attired revelers who paid $200 or $350 ate white-bean salad and chicken with tapenade at a benefit for the Prospect Park Alliance in Brooklyn. 
 In an era of fiscal sobriety, organizers of benefits and bashes have had to rethink not only the menus but every aspect of the catered affair, and caterers have been more than accommodating.
Many caterers, but especially those in the East, report that after a slow start, bookings for the fall and winter social season are ahead of last year but that their clients -- corporations, charities, arts organizations, politicians and social groups -- are spending less on parties. "People are more price-conscious than ever," said Sandy Sobel, director of catering sales in Lincoln Center for Restaurant Associates . "They want to spend $60 or $65 a person on the same menu that cost them $75 last year, and we're trying to accommodate them in order to keep the clients."
One of the cost-conscious is Pam Sarnoff, who is the chairwoman of the Winter Antiques Show preview party, to be held on Jan. 25 in New York for the benefit of the East Side House Settlement, a South Bronx social-services organization. While the ticket prices, $500 and $250 each, are the same as last year, Mrs. Sarnoff said, "This year we're hoping to spend less on a per-person basis, but we want to make it just as good as in the past. It's up to the caterer to make it happen."
Caterers say they have had to be more creative. "You cut costs, shave your profit, because you want to do the business no matter what," said William Homan, an owner of Design Cuisine in Washington. "I want to be here for them now, so they'll be back when they have a lot of money."
But some caterers have seen clients who once entertained generously go out of business or try to weather tough times. Several caterers on both coasts lamented the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert. "Losing Drexel Burnham and a major retail client was real blow," said Dounia Rathbone, an owner of Remember Basil Ltd., which catered the Prospect Park party.
"I feel something of the same impact as the restaurant industry," said Henry Dinardo, owner of Windows Catering in Rosslyn, Va., just outside Washington. "Instead of a four-course rack-of-lamb dinner for $40, they'll go with three courses and roast breast of capon for $30 or $35."
But unlike restaurants, caterers, even hotel banquet departments, can be flexible about pricing. Their overhead for rent, utilities and payroll are lower. And they have more options than just food and wine for adjusting the price. For example, if a restaurant changed glassware it would not affect the cost of dining there, but a caterer can trim as much as $4 a person by using plain stemware instead of cut crystal.
"We're in a value-oriented economy and a caterer can deliver what a client needs by individualizing," said Steve Zagor, a former caterer who is manager of restaurant consulting for Laventhol & Horwath, an accounting and consulting firm.
Charities and arts groups in particular have much tighter budgets. "They can't raise the ticket price in this economy and they're having a harder time selling tickets, so they have to cut costs in order to have a successful fund-raising event," said Liz Neumark, owner of Great Performances, a New York caterer.
Carlyn Berghoff, owner of Carlyn Berghoff Catering in Chicago, said some clients are delaying commitments. "People are booking their parties later, no more than three months in advance, compared with as much as a year in the past," she said. "They obviously do not want to submit that 50 percent deposit so far ahead, and they're waiting until they have a better fix on what they can afford."
Some caterers have already seen evidence that many companies are thinking twice about Christmas parties. "Instead of a $25,000 Saturday-night bash, they're going to arrange a party in-house with the secretaries ordering the food, and they're spending one-tenth as much," said Cynthia Colman, a corporate-event planner in San Francisco.
Harriette Rose Katz, a party planner in New York, said she has already had Christmas party cancellations.
Most businesses still have to do some entertaining, though, and some caterers are finding that this creates opportunities if they can meet the need for simpler, less expensive fare. Chip Fisher, an owner of Fisher & Levy, which specializes in delivering elegant sandwich and salad platters to offices in midtown Manhattan at lunchtime, said his business is up. "We've replaced the business lunch in a restaurant for a lot of companies," he added. "The most you can spend with us is about $22 a head."
Changing tastes have made tailoring the cuisine to the budget perhaps the easiest adjustment of all for caterers.
"It's now the rage to do simple but tasty food," Mr. Homan said. "You do not have to serve the most expensive veal and lamb anymore. You make up for it with style, by serving stuffed capon over polenta, and by calling the beans flageolets." In fact, he added, "It's more interesting for us when the client is willing to bend."
Paula LeDuc of Paula LeDuc Catering in Oakland, Calif., said, "Food has changed. People want more for their money and we're serving abundant Mediterranean-style food instead of skimpy designer nouvelle things."
But typically, food accounts for no more than 50 percent of a catered party's costs, and often only about a third. Labor is a major expense and Nancy Kirby Harris, owner of Aller Cuisine Ltd. in Chicago, said clients have asked her to cut back on staffing. "One woman suggested her husband could be the bartender," she saId. "Then I reminded her that we were talking about 150 people and he was also supposed to be the host."
Most caterers are reluctant to cut their staffs. "Without adequate staff, the affair will not run smoothly and we'll lose the client," said Ms. Rathbone of Remember Basil.
Many clients are instead changing the formats of parties. "With some of our corporate and private clients, cocktail buffets are replacing seated dinners," Miss Harris said.
In Washington, Mr. Homan reported, clients are sometimes giving a single reception for 400 people instead of two or three seated dinners for 150 to 200 people each.
Caterers are also compromising on equipment, wine, flowers and music. "Some people are thinking twice about gold chairs at $10 each and ordering something simpler, going with plainer tablecloths, and making do with a five-piece orchestra instead of seven," Miss Harris said.
Ms. Neumark said, "We are pouring a lot of Hawk Crest these days," referring to a well-made California wine that sells for around $6 a bottle.
Miss Colman in San Francisco said some clients are saving up to $1,000 by eliminating valet parking.
Becky Tiegler, a flower arranger in Chicago, said she was sometimes able to halve the price of the flowers for a party by changing the design. She buys her flowers wholesale, and said the price of imported flowers has escalated in the last few weeks because of the increase in fuel prices to the airlines. "This season, people have started calling me wanting to buy the flowers but saying they will do their own arranging," she added. "I won't do that."
Robert Isabell, who handles the floral decorations for some of New York's most highly publicized parties, said he was frequently substituting less-expensive but excellent California-grown flowers.
Not all parts of the country or all segments of the industry have been hit hard. In Oklahoma and Texas, some caterers say business has improved. "Since the price of oil started going back up, things have started picking up and it's better than it was the past couple of years," said John Bennett, a caterer in Oklahoma City, who also does parties in Texas.
There has also been no limit on lavishness when it comes to parties in the entertainment industry. "They're still throwing extravaganzas," said Julie Loshin, president of Parties Plus Inc. in Los Angeles.
And people are still pulling out all the stops for weddings, bar mitzvahs and similar private celebrations as well. "Families have long budgeted the money for these once-in-a-lifetime events and they're prepared to go ahead as planned," said Mrs. Katz, the New York party planner. Ms. Rathbone agreed that many caterers "can still make good money on outrageous events like weddings."
Perhaps there is another explanation for why some people are entertaining as if there were no tomorrow, suggests one caterer.
"Maybe what we're seeing is the Titanic effect," Mr. Zagor suggested. "Having one big bash before things really get bad."

HEADLINE: Environmental Bond Means Too Much Pain for Too Little Gain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The New York Farm Bureau, with 23,000 members, New York State's largest farm organization, urges New York City voters to reject the 21st century environmental quality bond. Though our farm families strongly support efforts to safeguard the environment, we believe this $2 billion bond is long on debt and short on quality. 
 Proponents of the environmental bond fail to mention that it will cost taxpayers in excess of $1.5 billion in debt service. The state-level debt, for which taxpayers are directly or indirectly responsible, has already reached $25 billion. The state is placing an incredible tax burden on both current and future taxpayers, by this "run to the bank" fiscal policy we practice.
In addition, I'm certain that New Yorkers will not soon forget the fiscal crisis that the state experienced last spring. It took nearly $2 billion of new taxes and fees to cover the budget shortfall. Early reports indicate that last year's fiscal woes will likely rear their ugly head again next year.
 New York State can ill afford a further decline of its economic position. This state's credit rating is the third worst in the nation -- only the financially distraught states of Massachusetts and Louisiana have a lower standing.
The overwhelming majority of the borrowed dollars, $800 million, would go to buy more land. New York State already owns four million acres, or about 13 percent of the state. Simply buying more land is not necessarily the best or most efficient way to protect the environment.
This environmental bond is misleading. It would allocate $201 million to maintain environmental and recreational facilities. Going deeper in debt to paint picnic tables and other caretaker chores is not good fiscal policy. These dollars were diverted from the budget when the state fiscal crisis was in full gear this year.
Protecting the environment is important. However, the dollars that would go for debt service and land acquisitions dwarf the environmental-quality programs, like solid-waste management and water-quality activities.
To retard the growth in the tax burden and in state debt, tough fiscal management is needed. New Yorkers should vote "no" on this bond and send Albany a clear message -- enough is enough.

HEADLINE: Racism Has Always Been an Economic Issue;
Forgotten Inventor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Inspirational Black History Draws Academic Fire" (front page, Oct. 10), you treat "black history" as "inspirational," rather than of value for the school curriculum. This dismisses the many African challenges to the Eurocentric curriculum and their vast documentation, and leaves the impression that they are exaggerations or fibs. This is a disservice to the truth and racial harmony. 
 Let's take one example. You appear to scoff at the statement that Lewis Howard Latimer had "drawn up the plans for Bell's telephone." Later you call "farfetched" the "implied suggestion that he invented the telephone." No such suggestion was made. In a glowing tribute issued on Latimer's death on Dec. 11, 1928, the Edison Pioneers gave him full credit: "It was Mr. Latimer who executed the drawings and assisted in preparing the applications for the telephone patents of Alexander Graham Bell." Latimer was an inventor to be remembered, yet how many high school graduates have ever heard of him?
The attack on the multicultural curriculum comes at a time when the public is beginning to learn that large numbers of African-Americans were cowboys on the frontier, members of great Indian nations and brave Union soldiers in the Civil War. Tens of thousands of African-Americans may have actually turned the tide of battle because they arrived when both sides had used up their white reserves. President Abraham Lincoln thought so and said so, but until the movie "Glory," few had any inkling of this.
Eurocentric public school history courses are filled with lies and exaggerations of the role of whites and omissions about the role of nonwhites. Indeed, the school curriculum itself has been a major if subtle obstacle to racial unity and peace in this country. Whites learn each day that nonwhites were evil redskins, sullen slaves or ghetto gangsters. Why should they not drift toward the David Dukes of this country? Nonwhites learn their ancestors never did anything anyone would respect.
We need a curriculum of inclusion and truth, that does not exaggerate anyone's role.

HEADLINE: Racism Has Always Been an Economic Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In assessing David Duke's defeat in Louisiana (Op-Ed, Oct. 9), Leonard Zeskind observes: "Mr. Duke's campaign themes echoed those of George Wallace in his 1968 Presidential bid: racism combined with a resentment of white elites." 
 It would have been more accurate to say "racism as an expression of resentment of white elites." Caste and class have consistently been confused on this issue.
Historical evidence supports the argument that the origins of slavery lie not in racism, though in the 17th century the English saw Africans as different from themselves, but rather in an effort by the white elite of Virginia to rid itself of the social turmoil that was created by land-hungry young white males who had served their indentures and called for economic compensation (not unlike the young white males in Louisiana of whom Mr. Zeskind speaks).
If more black servants were imported and their servitude was lifelong, the problem of lower-class white demands could be eliminated. (Of course, the willingness of Virginia's leaders to take this tack demonstrates their placing self-interest before the interest of black labor, not a classic racist stance.)
Although there was obviously a contradiction between the egalitarian ideals of the United States and the reality of slavery, a contradiction that helped create the Republican Party, nevertheless Abraham Lincoln's major concern about the extension of slavery seems to have been its threat to free white labor. With his typical clarity, Lincoln recognized the importance of the class issue.
The emancipation of the slaves did not lead directly to segregation, as it should have if American society was primarily and fundamentally racist. Rather, segregation arose in response to a threatening biracial political challenge from black and white farmers in the 1890's to the white elite -- which capitulated to racism after paternalism failed. Segregation collapsed in the face of a civil rights movement sustained by post-World War II prosperity, while racism is now resurgent in an era of economic decline.
This oversimplified summary is meant to document the assertion that racism has been and continues to be fostered by competition for limited resources, that is, it is primarily a class issue. It can best be fought by policies for economic and, hence, social justice.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Landlord's War For Enterprise In East Harlem

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Harley Brooke-Hitching looked, well, different from most attending Monday's luncheon at the Women's National Republican Club. She wore jeans and a baggy sweatshirt. Two young employees accompanying her wore the same.
"We're not going to steal nothing," one of the employees told a nervous woman at the front desk. 
 Make no mistake, Mrs. Brooke-Hitching was more than welcome in this staid bastion. She had arranged the refinancing of the club when its books were shaky. The Republican women had figured that if Mrs. Brooke-Hitching could secure loans to buy dilapidated buildings in East Harlem, she just might do the same for anybody.
The red-haired, 45-year-old whirlwind isn't a registered Republican, but vehemently supports business enterprise. Her mission for the last five years has been to try to make money renting decent apartments to some of New York's poorest people. She owns 180 units of low- and middle-income housing, mainly on 111th Street between Second and Third Avenues.
She had come to hear Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown speak. The Commissioner declared the root of the crime crisis is "the pervasive use of illegal drugs." Not news to Mrs. Brooke-Hitching.
Drugs are pandemic and pernicious on East 111th Street. She has found windows broken, been threatened and been hit in the face. So she compiled a list of drug dealers and drug apartments in her and others' buildings and sent it to city officials, including Mr. Brown.
There was the name of a man who holds drugs and guns, a woman who holds drugs for street runners (her children) and a man who sells drugs on weekends when he is released from jail. Despite her specificity, months have passed with no action.
Mrs. Brooke-Hitching mentioned this to the Commissioner after the speech. He thanked her and suggested she call her precinct.
"We're in contact with them a lot," she said wearily. "We just don't get any response."
 That morning, in her Upper East Side apartment, it had become clear that Harley Brooke-Hitching is an almost indescribable woman. There were exquisite antiques, leather-bound books, row upon row of fine wine. Country music, Don Williams to be specific, filled the room. Four large cats, once strays, lounged about. The coffee was instant.
One set of great-grandparents had been in the Oklahoma land rush; another carried British titles. She was educated in Britain, France and Italy -- that being "what a young girl did." At age 24, she was managing Sotheby's Amsterdam branch. There was marriage, divorce and one son, now 17. She lived in Bangkok, made a bundle from Asian art. A decade ago, she came to New York in search of "a bigger pond."
She couldn't find an apartment as large as the one she had left in Chicago. So she used her savings as a down payment on an entire building, converted it to co-ops and made a killing. She did even better with a bigger one.
In 1985, Mrs. Brooke-Hitching decided to invest in East Harlem. Part of the reason was economic: the real-estate boom had wildly inflated prices but the tawdry area remained cheap. Part was trying to link profit and altruism: That this landlord is of good heart is evident in her 1982 founding of City Harvest, which distributes food to the hungry.
There was a third factor. "I must say it's exciting," she said. "The adrenaline pumps."
Mrs. Brooke-Hitching had no illusion about her purchase. Not only did some of the 11 buildings not have locks, they lacked doors. "I was buying garbage."
But she scrambled and got financing. She painted the walls fanciful colors. Then, the value of her investment climbed. New tenants seemed more responsible. Her vision was confirmed: "Things can work for everybody."
Lately, though, she has become pessimistic. Drugs and crime are the most obvious scourge. But taxes, utilities and oil are going up faster than income. And she has learned to gripe the gripes of landlords. One is that no matter what a tenant does to your property, he is almost impossible to evict. Another is that housing court is "a zoo."
Unexpected expenses have included recycling fines. "I am now responsible for the recycling of the garbage of people who defecate in hallways," Mrs. Brooke-Hitching sighed.
All this comes while property owners' assets are crumbling in front of them. Her once pristine hallways are now marked by grafitti and dirt. She frets about banks' patience. She is tired of fighting City Hall.
But she hasn't given up. This unlikely landlord treasures remembering climbing Kilimanjaro on the morning of her 43d birthday. Just as she reached the top, the sun popped out.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Fell by 1.7% Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Orders to factories for "big ticket" durable goods fell 1.7 percent in September from August, the Government said today. Analysts said the report foretold a further slump in production and employment in the industrial sector, which has lost 500,000 jobs since January 1989.
"It was another report indicating the economy is slowing down," said Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, New York. He added that it probably showed "that we're in a recession -- but probably indicating the recession will be mild." 
 The Commerce Department said the value of orders for durable goods -- items expected to last more than three years -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $124.9 billion last month.
 
 Slump in Vehicles
 Transportation orders slid 6.8 percent, to $32.8 billion. Declines in motor vehicles more than offset an increase in aircraft.
"The main message is that dealers are not ordering 1991 model cars," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, Lexington, Mass.
Durable goods orders have fallen three times in the last four months and the Commerce Department said today that the August decline was even steeper than previously reported: eight-tenths of 1 percent rather than five-tenths of 1 percent. In the first nine months, it said, orders were off five-tenths of 1 percent compared with the first nine months of 1989.
Durable goods orders are a key barometer of the manufacturing industry's plans for production. A decrease in orders can result in production cutbacks and layoffs.
 
66,000 Jobs Lost
 In fact, the Labor Department reported earlier that 66,000 factory jobs were lost in September. Since reaching a post-recession peak in January 1989, the manufacturing sector has lost 500,000 jobs.
"The industrial sector is just muddling along," Ms. Latta said. "I expect industrial output to decline in the fourth quarter because of a lack of orders."
But Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist with Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago, said that while the report reflected continued softness in the manufacturing sector, it contained no "confirming" evidence that things would get worse.
He noted that excluding the transportation category, orders actually inched up three-tenths of 1 percent.
Orders in the key category of nondefense capital goods jumped 6.3 percent, to $38.2 billion, but failed to regain the 9.9 percent loss of August. While these orders are often a barometer of business plans to expand and modernize, Mr. Platt suggested that many of them might have come from overseas.
"The strength in exports probably will be one of the factors that will keep a recession relatively mild," he said.
Orders for nonelectrical machinery rebounded 5.4 percent, to $22.5 billion, from a 5.1 percent drop in August. Office and computing equipment had the largest gain.
But orders for electrical machinery fell 7.7 percent, to $19.1 billion, after advancing 2.2 percent the previous month. Both communications equipment and electronic components were down sharply.
Orders for primary metals also declined, by eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $11.4 billion. They had fallen 2.5 percent in August.
The often-volatile military orders were off 9.6 percent, to $7.6 billion, following a 12.5 percent increase the previous month.
Shipments of durable goods were down 3 percent, to $124.7 billion, losing a 2.8 percent advance in August. Unfilled orders were unchanged at $499.5 billion, following a three-tenths of 1 percent loss the previous month.

U.S. Joins in 2d Vote At U.N. to Criticize Israel Over 21 Slain

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The United States voted with the rest of the Security Council tonight to deplore Israel's refusing to cooperate with an investigation of the killing of 21 Palestinians in a clash with Israeli security forces two weeks ago.
The unanimous council vote, the second to criticize Israel in 12 days, had been postponed for 24 hours at the request of the United States so that President Bush could send an appeal to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel to reconsider his Government's refusal to cooperate with the United Nations inquiry into the Oct. 8 killings. 
 Israel rejected the appeal today, and after promising members to make "another serious attempt" at changing Israel's position, the United States representative, Thomas R. Pickering, returned to the council chamber empty-handed.
Diplomats said that as with the earlier council resolution against Israel Washington's vote was largely influenced by its desire to preserve the international coalition opposing the seizure of Kuwait by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
On Oct. 12, the Security Council voted unanimously to approve a resolution condemning Israel for using excessive violence four days earlier in suppressing stone-throwing demonstrators at Al Aksa Mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem.
The new resolution "deplores" Israel's refusal to receive an investigative team that Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar planned to send to Jerusalem at the Security Council's behest. The mission was to report on the Oct. 8 incident and suggest ways to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories from further violence.
The new resolution urges Israel to reconsider its refusal and "insists that it comply fully" with the Oct. 12 resolution, which authorized the inquiry.
Last week, the Israeli Government said that although the United Nations investigators could come to the country it would not receive them or give assurances that its members would be able to meet Palestinian leaders. Mr. Perez de Cuellar responded by saying that he would not send the team.
 
U.N. Role on Israel Seen
 The resolution adopted today instructs the Secretary General to submit his report by the end of the month as planned even though his team will not be visiting Israel. The council "affirms its determination to give full and expeditious consideration to the report."
This means that later this month the Security Council will begin discussing possible new ways that the United Nations could help protect Palestinians against Israeli mistreatment.
Though it voted for the resolution tonight, the United States has said that in its view the process outlined by the Security Council does not give it the right to involve itself in the quest for a permanent peace settlement in the area.
But most other members see the Secretary General's report as opening the door to precisely such United Nations involvement. Some are likely to argue that the best way to protect Palestinians from further violence is to summon an international conference under United Nations auspices to settle the Palestinian question -- a gathering the Israeli Government has long opposed.
While irritation with the present Israeli Government's policies may partly explain the Bush Administration's endorsement of two anti-Israeli resolutions this month, diplomats believe another powerful factor is the need to preserve the unity of the moderate Arab coalition Washington has built up against the seizure of Kuwait by Iraq.
An American veto would embarrass the Arab states by casting the United States in the role of Israel's protector. It would also allow President Hussein to present himself as the true ally of the Palestinians.
As a result, the Security Council's campaign to oust Iraq's forces from Kuwait is becoming linked with the Palestinian question in the minds of most council members. They accept the Arabs' contention that the council cannot preserve its credibility if it punishes Iraq's aggression while turning a blind eye to Israel's continued occupation of Arab lands.
In a bitter address tonight, Israel's acting representative, Johanan Bein, accused the Palestine Liberation Organization of deliberately sidetracking the council from the Persian Gulf crisis by involving it in the Palestinian question. "It appears Saddam Hussein has been let off the hook," he said.
But Yemen's representative, Abdullah Saleh al-Ashlaf, the council's only Arab member, said the council should impose trade sanctions on Israel if it continues to disobey its orders just as it imposed them against Iraq.
The P.L.O.'s acting observer, Nasser al-Kidwa, also asked the Security Council to institute a stronger link between its handling of Iraq and Israel, saying it should be prepared to impose economic sanctions on Israel.

In Case of War, Congress Wants Right to Meet

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Congressional leaders said today that they would reserve the right to reconvene Congress in case the Bush Administration decides to go to war against Iraq after the current Congressional session ends.
Under usual procedures only the President can call lawmakers back to Washington. But the House Speaker, Representative Thomas S. Foley, and the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, said that a provision would be included in an adjournment resolution allowing them to reconvene the Congress. 
 They also said that an 18-member bipartisan group of lawmakers was being set up to consult with President Bush after the session ends, probably before the end of the week.
Some members of Congress have expressed strong concerns about the prospects for war in the Persian Gulf as a result of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait . The Bush Administration has repeatedly refused to yield to demands by lawmakers that Congress should have a say in its decision on whether or when to initiate military action against Iraq.
 
'Only Thing We Can Do'
 "I think it is about the only thing we can do at this point," said Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
"It does not exactly do the trick, but it is as close as we can get," he added.
The Congressional steps were suggested by Representative Dante B. Fascell, Democrat of Florida, who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney declined to make any commitments to lawmakers on consultation over possible action in the gulf at unusual closed-door meetings with House and Senate members today.
Even though Administration officials have suggested that they are emphasizing economic sanctions and that war is not imminent, some lawmakers believe that there are increasing pressures for war against Iraq.
 
'Headed Toward Conflict'
 Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, senior Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said today that the United States and other members of the multinational force were moving toward war with Baghdad.
"The fact is that we're headed toward conflict," Mr. Lugar said on the NBC News program "Today."
At the meetings on Capitol Hill, Mr. Cheney said that the Administration was considering whether to send additional troops to the Persian Gulf, what rotations to establish for American troops in the region and what to do with the Army's 82d Airborne Division.
Some Army officials believe that two more divisions should be sent to Saudi Arabia if the United States decides to take offensive. And some military planners say that the 82d Airborne, which was deployed early in the American operation to protect airfields in Saudi Arabia and get troops on the ground in a hurry, should be replaced by a heavier, mechanized unit.
 
Baker Tells of Overtures
 Mr. Cheney reportedly also told House members that the Pentagon would be prepared to send combat reserve units to the Persian Gulf, as some lawmakers have demanded, if Congress would amend the law so that the units could be called up for more than six months.
Mr. Baker said at his meetings on Capitol Hill that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had made a number of overtures to Western officials in an effort to split the coalition against him.
Mr. Baker said President Hussein had invited the German Foreign Minister and Canadian officials to Baghdad, suggesting that they would be rewarded with the release of German and Canadian hostages. Mr. Baker said that the Germans and Canadians had refused the overtures.
Iraq announced today that all 327 French citizens in Iraq and Kuwait could leave within days and recently allowed the departure of 33 Britons and 14 Americans.
 
Arms Sale Details Disclosed
 In other comments, Mr. Baker emphasized that American and other hostages were being poorly treated by the Iraqis and added that President Bush takes very seriously his responsibility to protect American citizens. Mr. Baker's comments on this point were so strong that some lawmakers later said they wondered if he was stating a rationale for military action.

HEADLINE: U.S. Raises a Question IN Brazil's Dept Talks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
A top United States Treasury official told Brazil's central bank president yesterday that he was worried about the more than $8 billion in unpaid interest owed to commercial bankers.
The remark is an indication that Brazil cannot expect to get approval of a $2 billion emergency loan until it reaches an acceptable arrangement with the banks to pay the arrears. 
 The dispute over the unpaid interest is also souring the debt negotiations with Brazil's commercial bankers, which began earlier this month. Bankers were angered to find out that the Brazilian Government was quietly buying back its debt at a huge discount in the open market, using money that could be used to pay interest on its loans.
 
 World's Biggest Debtor
 Continuing problems with unpaid interest, as well as with proposals made by Brazil and rejected by its bankers, could mean the negotiations will be long and drawn out. Brazil is the developing world's biggest debtor, with a total debt of about $113 billion, including $60 billion owed to commercial banks, and difficulties in the negotiations would undermine the Bush Administration's debt strategy of the last year and a half.
In addition, if nothing is resolved on the loan interest, which Brazil stopped paying in April 1989, American banks could be forced by Federal banking regulators to write off an additional 20 percent of the value of their loans to Brazil, which could force losses at a time when bank earnings are already declining.
David C. Mulford, Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, made the comment about the unpaid interest in a meeting with Ibrahim Eris, the president of the Brazilian central bank, Mr. Eris said in an interview. Mr. Eris also met with the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The comment appeared to reflect a feeling in Washington that Brazil's reluctance to make a substantial commitment to erasing the arrears is sending a bad signal to other debtor nations.
Although the I.M.F. and the World Bank modified their policies in 1989 to allow debtor countries to get some financial assistance while still in arrears on bank loan interest, Brazil's position now seems to be pushing this accommodation too far, officials said.
But Mr. Eris said Mr. Mulford did not directly say that Brazil had to pay more of its arrears.
Mr. Eris said he came to the United States to explain the Brazilian proposal, convince officials that the country is serious about negotiating and "win hearts and minds for the Brazilian case." He said Brazil could make limited interest payments because the Government could raise the money only by cutting spending and increasing revenue.
But the bankers argue that Brazil has at least $8.5 billion in dollar reserves, generated through trade, which means it can make larger interest payments.
 
'A Positive Attitude'
 Mr. Eris also said Brazil was "open to any proposal" from its bankers on the interest arrears. One banker suggested that remark reflected "a positive attitude."
William R. Rhodes, senior executive-international at Citibank and the head of the bank negotiating committee, said its economic subcommittee would return from Brazil tomorrow. He said the full committee would then meet.
In the first proposal made to commercial bankers when negotiations began earlier this month, Brazilian officials said that they could pay no more than $1.4 billion in interest next year and that there would be no payments until January. The banks have rejected this proposal.

HEADLINE: Fernandez and Teachers Union: Are 2 Sides Too Close?

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
As New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez has maintained a relationship with the teachers union that strikes some educators as uncommonly close and visible given the city's history of often-fierce labor-management wars.
The alliance has benefited both sides, and it may also benefit the education of New York's children through more attractive salaries for teachers, cooperation in decision-sharing programs between teachers and principals and a number of legislative changes that could improve the accountability for all professionals in the system. 
 But some city officials and educators are concerned about possible perils, saying that the salary increases that this alliance negotiated may strain the city's finances and that Mr. Fernandez will not work hard enough to remove ineffective or abusive teachers.
At no time has the alliance seemed stronger than since a new one-year contract gave teachers a 5.5 percent raise. On Tuesday, when an article in The Daily News suggested that the economic pain unleashed bythe contract might lead to teacher layoffs, both Mr. Fernandez and a spokesman for the union reacted with the same angry tone and both blamed City Hall.
"The story coming out of City Hall is not accurate," Mr. Fernandez said.
"This kind of game playing goes to the heart of why the City Hall budget people have no credibility with us," said Bert Shanas, a spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers.
Mr. Fernandez, aides said, has also called City Hall to complain that he is receiving mixed signals about the merits of a contract both he and the administration helped negotiate. Aides said the Chancellor was being told to promote the contract publicly even though newspaper stories stemming from City Hall suggest that it was too generous. Yesterday, Mr. Fernandez, after being asked by City Hall to prepare $94 million in possible cuts from the board's $6.5 billion budget, said he had decided to offer roughly half the cuts he was asked for, without, he pointedly said, a single teacher layoff. His position was endorsed by the Board of Education last night in a letter sent to Mayor David N. Dinkins.
For now, Mr. Dinkins appears not to see Mr. Fernandez's attitude as one of defiance but rather as a desire for more time to work with the numbers.
"A program that gives you only half the cuts that you are responsible for probably will not get you a passing grade," said Lee Jones, a spokesman for the Mayor. Robert F. Wagner Jr., former president of the Board of Education, says that while Irving Anker, who was Chancellor in the mid-1970's and Dr. Bernard E. Donovan, who was Chancellor in the mid- and late 60's, had closer but less open friendships with the union, Mr. Fernandez's alliance with Sandra Feldman, the union's president, is perhaps the most visible in memory.
"Joe has not been afraid to be public with the U.F.T. as opposed to other chancellors," Mr. Wagner said.
In some ways, the relationship is a marriage of convenience. Noreen Connell, executive director of the Educational Priorities Panel, a coalition of advocacy groups, pointed out that the city government and the Board of Education depended on the union, with its 107,000 politically astute members, to get their programs and financing schemes approved in Albany, and that the union depended on the board to treat its teachers kindly and pay them well.
Charles I. Schonhaut, a former deputy chancellor who is now dean of the Long Island University School of Education, said the relationship had enabled Mr. Fernandez to win enactment of laws limiting tenure for principals and abolishing the Board of Examiners.
"Realistically, the most powerful group in education today is the U.F.T., so by making them his allies he got their support for legislation," he said.
 
'Enlightened New Management'
 Ms. Feldman applauds her working relationship with Mr. Fernandez and argues that "all enlightened new management is involving its workers in decision-making."
James S. Vlasto, press secretary to the Chancellor, asserted that the relationship had given Mr. Fernandez "a lot of strength in relating to teachers." He said Mr. Fernandez had extracted more than 200 changes in the contract, "all positive," laying a contractual groundwork for school-based decision-making and tightening discipline. The relationship, he said, will make it easier for Mr. Fernandez to get teachers to work a longer day.
Mr. Fernandez won the union's backing as the leading candidiate for chancellor largely because of his warm relationship with labor as superintendent of Miami's schools. Indeed, Mr. Fernandez sometimes reached for a joke to deflect criticism of his tight bond with Pat Tornillo, the head of the teachers union there.
"I want to reassure you that because we wear the same color suits, the same color socks and because I roll over in the morning and say, 'Pat, what are you wearing today?' doesn't mean we are in bed together," he was reported -- by Mr. Tornillo -- to have said in jest.
 
Variety of Issues
 Returning to New York City with few powerful acquaintances, Mr. Fernandez has had to rely on the union as his political bedrock. But Mr. Fernandez and Ms. Feldman also came to their relationship with a strong convergence of philosophies: a desire to give teachers a greater voice in the running of schools through the plan, which Mr. Fernandez started in Miami, called school-based management.
But the union has gone out of its way to support him, even on issues that may not affect teachers directly. On Tuesday, both Mr. Fernandez and a union representative testified at an Assembly committee hearing in favor of a greater role for the chancellors in the selection of superintendents. The proposal will have no immediate benefits for teachers, though ultimately, its advocates claim, it will improve management systemwide. It threatens to alienate school board members who were elected with union support.
"It shows the union's trust in him," Mr. Schonhaut said.
 
Matter of Timing
 By contrast, the principals union, the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, has been arguing that the Chancellor should only set minimum qualifications for superintendents and not be allowed to veto candidates.
"From our point of view," said Donald Singer, president of the principals union, "there are going to be issues which you don't agree about."
The relationship between the teachers union and Mr. Fernandez was made possible by fortuitious timing. Under Mayor Edward I. Koch, Mr. Schonhaut says, the city administration dictated management terms in labor negotiations, regardless of what the Board of Education's members or the chancellor wanted to do. Mr. Koch believed that all unions should get equivalent raises, with no preferences for teachers.
In 1984, Mr. Schonhaut recalled, Chancellor Nathan Quinones testifed at a City Council hearing in favor of pay raises for teachers. "City Hall jumped all over him," saying. " 'That's not your business. We will decide what the raise will be,' " Mr. Schonhaut recalled.
 
Misgivings About Alliance
 But under Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Schonhaut said, Mr. Fernandez was able to take "a role in the negotiations which no chancellor had taken before."
Even those who see benefits in the alliance between the central school administration and the teachers union have some misgivings about it. One former board official who asked for anonymity said Mr. Fernandez did not receive anything in return for the pay raise. A key concession by the union -- a new binding-arbitration procedure set up to speed the handling of disciplinary cases against teachers -- turned out to be not compulsory, but an option that teachers facing charges could choose.
Disappointed, Ms. Connell contends that Mr. Fernandez "could be very much more tough about" seeking the ouster of incompetent teachers. Although she sees many merits in the amicable relationship, she worries that even when Mr. Fernandez takes a principled position he will be seen as currying favor with the union.
She noted that the Chancellor, in seeking 5.5 percent pay raises, was genuinely concerned about the drain of experienced teachers to higher-paying suburban districts. But again, she says, his position happened to converge with that of the union and the perception of its integrity was undercut.

HEADLINE: Bankers Face Increasing Skepticism Among Investors

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Oct. 24

 BODY:
The high dividend that Citicorp was forced to pay today on a preferred stock issue served as a reminder that many investors are skeptical about the strength of large banks despite assurances by bankers and regulators that they are solvent.
Bankers gathered here for a meeting of the American Bankers Association noted that data of the Federal Reserve through mid-October show that Citicorp and other large banking companies like Chase and Chemical have not been hit with enough deposit withdrawals to force them to borrow at the Fed's discount window. 
 But problems with bad real estate loans and weak earnings at the large banks have made investors and depositors more nervous than at any time since the Federal deposit insurance program was created in 1933.
Short-term deposit ratings for the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company are all lower than the highest grade assigned by Moody's Investor Services, which many investors require. Citicorp, however, still has a top Moody's rating.
 
 Demanding Higher Yields
 In the financial markets, corporate treasurers are demanding high yields in return for taking the risk of holding bank securities, whose values might decline in the current weak banking climate. Still, analysts are not predicting that any large banks will become insolvent anytime soon.
Corporate treasurers are not the only American financiers to feel uneasy about large New York City banks. The chief credit officer at one large regional bank with more than $15 billion of assets said he recently stopped making overnight and short-term loans to some New York banks and has sharply cut back lending to weaker New York banks with which he does large amounts of other business. "I don't get paid enough to take the risk," he said, adding that there are many lower-risk alternatives.
Michael Esposito, chief financial officer at Chase Manhattan, said that "some lines have been cut," referring to credit lines from banks that in years past routinely lent their excess cash to Chase. In the Eurodollar market, where large New York banks are heavy borrowers from foreign institutions, Mr. Esposito said interest rates paid by Chase had moved up relative to that paid by some other banks. Things have jumped around for a month or two, he said, "but they will come back to normal."
Bankers and regulators meeting here also expressed concern that talk about changing the Federal Deposit Insurance System could intensify the fears of depositors, possibly prompting them to withdraw their funds from banks. About 35 percent of the public believes that the banking system is unhealthy, according to a recent survey by the American Banker, the trade newspaper.
 
Regulator Calls for Caution
 "In this environment, we need to be awfully careful when talking about deposit insurance reform," said Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, the top regulator for most of the nation's largest banks. "Let's not spook people, depositors, into making irrational decisions," he said in an interview here.
Many recent proposals, like cutting the amount of deposits covered by insurance or requiring automatic losses for large depositors at failed banks, can be dangerous, Mr. Clarke said. "They all sound like a pulling away of the support system that traditionally existed for the banking industry," he said.
Robert H. Smith, chairman of the Security Pacific Corporation in Los Angeles, said that "if there is change in deposit insurance, it is important that it be done with a great deal of caution, and over time."
A key aspect of deposit insurance for large banks is the extent to which Federal insurance protects deposits above the ceiling of $100,000 per account. Last month, Federal Reserve officials urged the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to protect all foreign deposits at the failed National Bank of Washington. If those deposits were not fully protected, Fed officials said, foreigners might be prompted to withdraw a large part of the $380 billion they have on deposit in American banks.
 
Concern at Small Banks
 Smaller banks are also concerned that changes in deposit insurance could disrupt their business. "Deposit insurance is our biggest advantage when it comes to competing with the money market mutual funds," said Robert E. Marling, executive vice president at the Woodforest National Bank, Houston.
Proposals to limit coverage to a total of $100,000 a depositor rather than $100,000 an account "would chase a lot of people away from the bank" to investments like Treasury bills, Mr. Marling said.
David W. Mullins Jr., a Federal Reserve governor, said the Treasury might propose next year that bank customers be limited to no more than three insured accounts of a maximum of $100,000 each, rather than the unlimited number of $100,000 accounts at present.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
Aides Say Bush Faced Choice: A Deal on Taxes, or a Fiasco

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
In a tense Oval Office meeting late Tuesday night, the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, and the House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, bluntly told President Bush that he had to choose between a deal or a fiasco.
The President's advisers and Cabinet were split on whether to stop talking to the Democrats or continue the search for a path out of the budget impasse. 
 According to officials close to the White House budget deliberations, a number of White House figures, including Vice President Dan Quayle, had recommended that the bargaining be halted. In earlier meetings and discussions, they argued that the President had given too much ground and that no deal was better than a bad one.
 
Arguments for a Deal
 But weighing in on the other side were the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu; the budget director, Richard G. Darman, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who attended the meeting with the Republican leaders. Too much was at stake, they contended, to pull the plug on the negotiations over the issue of how to tax people with adjusted annual incomes above $1 million.
Mr. Dole then gave the President a general description of a plan that appeared to offer a way out. The plan, which is incorporated in the current compromise, would combine a smaller limit on itemized deductions for taxpayers making more than $100,000 with a phaseout of personal exemptions for that income group.
Mr. Dole knew that such a plan had the backing of the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and that he stood a fair chance of persuading other Democratic leaders as well as the chairmen of the two Congressional tax committees to go along if the President would also agree. He also knew that the plan had passed political muster with Mr. Darman.
If the deal being negotiated tonight holds together, officials said, the Tuesday night meeting will be looked upon as a watershed. In any event, it provided a clear picture of the intense political pressures generated by the budget crisis and the growing willingness of Congressional leaders to confront Mr. Bush.
Armed with counts from party whips of how the House and Senate votes would line up, the Republican leaders made clear that a surtax on the very rich, favored by Democrats and some House Republicans, could not pass the Senate and that a stiff limit on itemized deductions for the wealthy, favored by the Administration and the Senate, could not pass the House.
"I gave him the whole picture," said Mr. Michel. "The President has to know that, not just what the numbers are, but how members feel. I spelled it all out to him."
Administration and Congressional officials said another factor was that, at some point in the preceding 24 hours, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who had until that time steered clear of involvement in the budget, added his voice to the faction advising the President to make a deal. Several officials suggested that Mr. Darman, a former top aide to Mr. Baker in the Reagan Administration, may have had something to do with enlisting Mr. Baker as a political counselor.
 
Baker Warns Bush of Damage
 Officials said that Mr. Baker told the President that he faced considerable political and economic damage if he did not find a way to make a deal.
On Tuesday night, as Mr. Dole and Mr. Michel were meeting with the President at the White House, House Democratic leaders were mulling the possibility of proceeding with their own budget package, surtax on millionaires and all, even if it meant rejection by the Senate and the White House.
With that prospect in mind, Senator Dole laid out the possibility for a face-saving compromise involving the phaseout of the exemptions taxpayers can claim for themselves and their dependents.
The phasing out of personal exemptions, dubbed PEP by the Democrats and POPE by Mr. Dole as it began to take on life today, was the brainchild of Lindy Paull, the chief tax aide to Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee. Mr. Packwood said he began looking at the idea late last week, before it had become clear that budget negotiations between the House and the Senate were bogged down over the issue of a surtax on millionaires.
His first thought was to try the idea out on William Diefenderfer, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget who is a former chief tax counsel to the Finance Committee. When Mr. Diefenderfer signaled that the Administration response would be positive, Mr. Packwood broached the plan with Senator Dole.
 
'Fly in the Ointment'
 "I saw it as a way to raise taxes on the wealthy that was workable," Mr. Packwood said. "But there was one fly in the ointment. It took all day Monday to get estimates for how much revenue it would produce." According to Congressional Democrats, the initial estimates were hardly promising, showing that the exemption phaseout would raise only $2 billion over five years, far short of the amount that could be produced by placing a surtax on people earning more than $1 million a year or limiting itemized deductions.
Although Mr. Mitchell was quick to endorse the plan, or some variation of it, as the basis for a compromise, other Democrats, including Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, were skeptical.
Among the White House figures who lobbied against a deal were Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher; the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Jack F. Kemp, and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Michael J. Boskin.
By Tuesday, the prospects for a deal appeared to be deteriorating in both the House and Senate alike, and while leaders in both chambers were aware of Mr. Packwood's plan, rank-and-file members were not even aware that such an idea had been floated.
Mr. Dole made his final pitch to House Democratic leaders at a meeting this morning, armed with both the President's consent for the plan to phase out exemptions and revenue estimates showing that at least one variation of it could produce as much as $8 billion in new revenue over five years. Mr. Packwood said it was all a question of timing.
"When you're looking for the piece that puts the deal together," he said. "You don't want to come too early."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS: Shooting Their Feet;
Sure, Some Officials Can Exult Now, But Government Itself Lies Wounded

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The Democrats won the political battle over the budget, almost all the Washington score-keepers were saying tonight, and gave President Bush some nasty bruises in the process, but in the deepest sense, there were no victors.
 The shaky compromise that apparently ended five months of confusion and conflict between the White House and Capitol Hill, between Democrats and Republicans, came far too late to avoid severe damage to the reputations of President Bush, the Congress and the Government itself. To a degree unparalleled since the late 1960's, the ability of Washington to discern and promote the common weal -- in effect, to govern -- is being widely questioned. 
 The doubt is demonstrated in the proliferation of proposals to limit the terms of legislators, but also in the election-season comments of voters.
A Democrat in Pensacola, Fla., challenged a visitor from Washington this month to "name a single person up there who really cares about helping the average guy," and a Republican in Cleveland argued that "if every public official in the city lost his job, and every job was filled by someone just out of college, the government couldn't be any worse than it is right now."
 
Anti-Government Bandwagon
 Even Mr. Bush, whose flip-flops on tax policy over the past few weeks helped to deepen the evolving crisis of confidence in government, has been trying to identify himself with the heartland and not the capital. A man who has spent most of his adult life on a governmental payroll, the President exclaimed the other day that it was wonderful to be out campaigning among "real people" who had nothing to do with politics.
The constant denunciation of politicians and process -- by journalists, scholars, the public and even by politicians themselves -- can only weaken the already feeble public inclination to participate in politics by voting.
But in the short term, the President and his party were clearly more heavily damaged than the Democrats.
With the mid-term elections less than two weeks away, Republican candidates are reeling. Republican Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota and Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, all of whom had seemed headed for easy re-election a couple of months ago, are all in peril now, at least partly because of the events in Washington. Representative Tom Tauke of Iowa, who had been given a good chance of ousting Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat, appears to have fallen back in the latest polls.
 
An Image That Hurts
 David Keene, a Republican political consultant, said "the bottom has dropped out" for G.O.P. candidates.
As Bob Dole, the canny Kansan who leads the Republicans in the Senate, foresaw weeks ago, the Democrats have succeeded in reviving the imagery of the 1930's, when Herbert Hoover and the Republicans were stigmatized as the party of the rich. Sensing a populist rebellion against the easy money and ostentation of the 1980's, the Democrats have seized upon the code word "fairness" and painted themselves as the champions of the middle class.
President Ronald Reagan's political alchemy -- persuading almost everyone that lower taxes meant more money for almost everyone -- appears to have lost its magic with Mr. Reagan's retirement.
Inevitably, opposition control of both houses of Congress, by a larger margin than faced by any other incoming President, meant that Mr. Bush would have to yield some ground if he wanted to push through a deficit-reduction package. Although many Republicans still dispute the point, others believe he had no choice but to abandon his cherished "no-new-taxes" pledge.
 
Bush's Unruly Troops
 But tactical ineptitude has meant he had to abandon more than that. He fell back from his insistence that there could be no tax increases unless there was a cut in capital gains taxes, then from his insistence upon some other sort of "growth initiatives," then from his bottom line that while he could accept other tax rises, there could be no increase in basic income tax rates.
By this morning, his negotiators were reduced to negotiating not about the substance but about the form of a "soak-the-rich" element in the package. A White House aide commented sourly, "The Democrats have redrawn the battlefield so thoroughly that we couldn't fight for the millionaires any more."
Mr. Bush's job was made much harder by his inability to control the Republicans in the House, who voted against the first package he helped to negotiate and showed little sign today of backing the latest one. Their willingness to defy the President in an election year was greatly increased by the defection of Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a crucial figure in the Republican leadership in the House, who made it all too clear early on that he, leadership or no leadership, would support no tax increases at all.
Mr. Bush let him get away with it, in a way Lyndon B. Johnson or Richard M. Nixon would never have dreamed of doing. They would have been on the phone themselves, threatening unspeakable sanctions; this time, the White House has said little beyond the mild comment today by his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, that there would be penalties for the rebels. What kind of penalties? "Can't tell you," he said. "If we told you, it wouldn't be a surprise."
 
Democrats Elated, for Now
 The President's strength on other issues will undoubtedly be affected by his leadership failures on the budget. Today, for instance, he barely mustered a third of the Senate, losing a half-dozen Republicans as he averted an override of his civil-rights veto.
The budget compromise finally became possible because the Democrats, none too early, realized that they had won and had better declare victory. Their mood was nicely caught by Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk County, who commented, "It's one thing to tax people's pocketbooks, another to tax their patience."
It is a heady moment for the Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill, which has been ridiculed in the last few years for inept tactics of its own. In particular, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, have enhanced their reputations.
But the partisan tides will ebb and flow often between now and Mr. Bush's re-election campaign in 1992. What happens in the Persian Gulf and what happens to the economy as a whole will probably have more to do with his prospects than what has happened in Washington this summer and early fall; indeed, some Republican members of Congress suspect that he purposely has invited opprobrium now to get the budget fracas behind him and give the economy every possible chance to rebound by 1992, putting his own re-election interests ahead of theirs.
Still, it seems unlikely that Mr. Bush will ever recover the aura of omnicompetence that he had for his first 18 months in office -- one of the longest Presidential honeymoons on record. And it seems equally unlikely that the American public will quickly regain faith in the competence of their government and its leaders.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 10.15; High-Tech Stocks Strong

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, although a sharp rise in profits at Compaq Computer, a high-tech favorite, gave several technology stocks a lift.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.15 points, to 2,504.21, while the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose just 0.24 point, to 312.60. 
 The disparity suggests that traders and investors, still wary of third-quarter earnings reports, were concentrating on the blue chips and on a few other stocks likely to weather a market selloff.
Compaq jumped 4 1/8, to 47 1/2; Honeywell 4 1/4, to 83 3/4; I.B.M. 1 7/8, to 108 5/8; Digital Equipment 1, to 51 3/4, and NCR 1 5/8, to 51 1/4.
Program trading was heavy but moved the market ahead less than a point, Birinyi Associates said.
In the wake of a big drop in durable goods orders in September, sentiment grew that inflationary pressures were weakening and could mean that short-term interest rates would be coming down soon.
Of course, nothing is likely to happen on interest rates until some kind of budget package is adopted. But while traders long ago gave up trying to guess when that would happen, "we know it'll happen one of these days," one trader remarked.
That sentiment helped lift the Dow a bit but gave little help to the rest of the market.
While several market technicians are beginning to talk of the market touching bottom soon and then starting to build for an upturn, many still saw yesterday's rise as just another rally in a bear market.
 
 Volume Rises to 149.3 Million
 Volume rose to a relatively slow 149.3 million shares, from an even slower 146.3 million on Tuesday. Advances barely outnumbered declines, 762 to 728, and 10 stocks reached new highs while 95 fell to new lows.
With investors watching bank stocks closely in the wake of weak earnings, mounting real estate difficulties and big job cutbacks, Chase Manhattan and Citicorp, two leading money center banks, topped the Big Board's list of the 10-most-active stocks.
Hibernia, the Louisiana and Texas banking company, was the sixth-most- active stock. Among the three stocks, nearly 13 million shares changed hands.
Chase fell 3/8, to 11 7/8, on 5.7 million shares. Citicorp fell 3/4, to 11 7/8, on 5.3 million. Although Hibernia recently trimmed its dividend to 60 cents a year from $1, its stock rose 3/8, to 7 1/8, on 1.7 million shares. Traders said a brokerage firm, possibly Japanese, had bought two big blocks to get the dividend and would probably resell the stock.
Although oil prices ended the day ahead $1.71, to $31.08, analysts said traders had anticipated the increase along with continuing delays on the budget, both of which have been big factors in the market.
More important yesterday, traders said, was that durable goods orders continued to drop, reinforcing Wall Street feelings that the economy is now in a recession.
A recession would bring lower interest rates, a rise in bond prices and a better stock market.
"That's why the selling dried up and buyers are nibbling," one trader said.
In other moves, General Electric, the third-most-active Big Board stock, fell 2 1/8, to 51 7/8, in what appeared to be continued reaction to an article in Barron's on Monday saying it could be vulnerable because of its huge real estate portfolio. G.E. called the article misleading and said it expected double-digit per share growth this year.
On the Amex, Continental Airlines Holdings plunged 1 5/8, to 4, in heavy trading after S.& P. cut its debt ratings because of higher fuel prices and a heavy debt schedule. Reports had also circulated that the company had considered, but rejected, a bankruptcy filing. It was the day's most active stock, on 904,000 shares.
 
NIKKEI INDEX RISES
TOKYO, Thursday, Oct. 25 (Reuters) -- Stocks in Tokyo were higher at midday today, helped by a stronger yen. At the end of the morning session, the 225-share Nikkei index was up 319.87, or 1.3 percent, to 25,196.75.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Post Small Gain

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved slightly higher and interest rates dipped in light trading yesterday, as dealers bought some securities on signs that agreement on the Federal budget was imminent.
The generally positive news on the budget outweighed a rise in oil prices. 
 "It was a mirror image of Tuesday," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "The news on the Middle East and the budget has been contradictory on an almost daily basis, and that has sort of frozen investors and the dealer community. People just don't know what is going to happen."
On Tuesday dealers sold securities when it appeared Congress had reached another intractable impasse over the budget.
It was unclear late yesterday whether Congress would approve yet another stop-gap increase in the Federal debt ceiling that would allow the Government to continue its operations. Unless it does so, the Government will be shut down today.
Failure to raise the debt ceiling yesterday forced the Treasury to postpone an auction of $12 billion worth of new two-year notes. Traders were struggling to compose a strategy to use once the new budget is passed and a flood of new Treasury issues hits the market.
"People are grappling with what to do once a budget gets passed," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Goverment Securities.
"Because of the on-coming supply, the consensus says sell. But I'm not sure that's the right thing to do, because it is virtually certain the Fed will ease policy after the budget gets passed."
In that regard, Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, commented yesterday that any significant move by the Fed to reduce short-term interest rates would probably cause long-term bond rates to rise. Mr. Capra and other market participants interpreted those remarks to mean that the Fed is not likely to move the overnight Federal funds rate down by more than 25 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, once a budget agreement is signed.
Mr. Parry was speaking to a business group in Stockton, Calif.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds were offered in late trading at a price of 99 3/4, up 5/32, to yield 8.77 percent, compared with 8.79 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 25/ 32, up 5/32, to yield 8.62 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 18/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.80 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly. Traders said bills might have been helped by yesterday's auction of Citicorp 49-day money market preferred stock, where yields skyrocketed to 12.50 percent.
"There could well have been a flight to quality into bills as a result of the Citicorp sale," Mr. Sullivan said.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.21 percent, unchanged on the day. Six-month bill rates dipped by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.16 percent. And one-year bill rates slipped by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.02 percent.
In the corporate bond market, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for two offerings of asset-backed securities.
In its first asset-backed deal ever, First Interstate Bancorp offered $623 million worth of securities backed by retail auto loans.
The 9 percent securities were priced at $99.687, to yield 9.14 percent, 1.30 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, based on a surety bond issued by the Capital Markets Assurance Corporation.
In addition, a subsidiary of the Chrysler Financial Corporation priced a $500 million offering of floating rate securities backed by auto loan receipts.
The securities have a final maturity of April 10, 1996. Interest rates were set at 17.5 basis points, above the 30-day commercial paper rate. The initial rate for the securities will be set tomorrow.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Also in the corporate bond market, Dow Chemical B.V. offered $150 million of three-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Lehman Brothers.
The 8 3/4 percent notes, which mature Nov. 1, 1993, were priced at $100, or par, 77 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the Texas Public Finance Authority sold $138 million worth of serial bonds at competitive bid.
A group led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets won the bonds, which range in maturity from 1991 to 2010. The securities were priced to yield 5.80 percent in 1991, 6.30 percent in 1995, 6.80 percent in 2000 and 7.30 percent in 2010.
The issue is rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues had risen by about 3/8 of a point.
In the secondary tax-exempt municipal bond market, prices of most widely quoted issues moved higher by about 1/8 of a point, market participants said.

HEADLINE: Skills-Training Policy Opening Doors to Jobs

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 17

 BODY:
For the last eight years researchers have clocked and gauged the experiences of several thousand single mothers here and in three other cities, trying to answer one of the most elusive questions in social policy: how to turn welfare recipients into workers.
As a result they are praising the approach of a San Jose program that stresses tangible job skills, rather than the popular back-to-basics regimen of remedial English and mathematics. No matter how well the women here are able to read or compute, they quickly get their hands on circuit boards, printing presses, typewriters and frying pans. 
 This approach is markedly different from the one that most states are using to carry out the Federal welfare-to-work law that took effect this month.
Early reports show most states are emphasizing basic education. The backers of the experiment here say the basic-education approach may prove less productive and undermine the efforts at welfare reform.
 
Praise for the Approach
 "There's something that's so motivating about thinking you are going to be in the real world, doing a real job, earning a real wage," said Phoebe Cottingham, an associate director at the Rockefeller Foundation, which paid for the $12 million study. "That, to an adult, is so much more important than going back to a situation where you've failed before: sitting in a classroom."
Ms. Cottingham said the San Jose program in some ways recalled the vocational training in vogue decades ago, before the rise of the basic-education movement. But the program eliminates aptitude tests, she said, and offers counseling, child care and other supportive services that help disadvantaged adults adapt to the workplace.
Three of the four cities' programs supported by the Rockefeller Foundation stressed the basic skills, but made no difference in the women's lives, according to an independent evaluation. Those programs were run by private organizations in Atlanta, Providence, R.I., and Washington. The single mothers there who received the training were no more likely to be employed, or to see their earnings rise, than a control group of similar women who did not join the program.
By contrast, women at the Center for Employment Training in San Jose were 27 percent more likely to have jobs a year later than those in a similar group who received no training. And their earnings were 47 percent higher.
The women in all four programs were members of minorities, and all had young children.
The San Jose gains are much larger than those reported from welfare-to-work tests in the early 1980's that were hailed as successes and were used to garner support for the training requirements in the law passed by Congress in 1988 to overhaul welfare.
 
Wide Latitude for States
 That law, now being carried out, requires that by October 1990 each state enroll some welfare recipients in training or education programs. But states have wide latitude over the kind of training or education they provide.
Many experts have called the San Jose results impressive, but caution that they may be difficult to replicate. The program may have benefited, for instance, from being in Silicon Valley, where narrow vocational skills may be more marketable than in other regions with fewer jobs.
The women trained here were disproportionately Hispanic, like Maria Melendez and Marie Guzman, and many had substantial work histories. It is unknown whether the same approach would work as well for women of other ethnic groups or women more accustomed to long-term dependency on welfare benefits.
The researchers acknowledged these factors, but argued that the stress on particular job skills was decisive.
Among the success stories is Francisca Covarrubias, 42 years old, who enrolled three years ago after a separation from her husband forced her and her four daughters onto welfare.
While she had little English and few skills, Ms. Covarrubias, a Mexican immigrant, had much determination. She had received welfare for only two months when she sought the training and she had a work history that included seven years in a laundry.
The San Jose program put her directly in a vocational class -- for sheet metal workers -- despite deficiencies in English and math resulting from a Mexican education ending in the sixth grade. Rather than pursue a full-time study of remedial education, she fit it in for two hours a day, between stints on sheet metal machines.
"If I study English, it takes me two years maybe -- I like to work," she said this week, in a fluency subsequently achieved in night school.
After six months Ms. Covarrubias graduated to a $5.25-an-hour job at Saucedo Metal Products, making parts for computer cabinets. She now earns $9 an hour as head of the stockroom there.
Some welfare experts, particularly liberals, argue that the remedial education is important because the modern economy needs workers who are literate and can adapt to changing technology. But in the Rockefeller study, many women in basic education classes grew discouraged and dropped out before the job training.
 
Difference in the Approach
 Some others have argued that actual work, even at low-paying, unskilled jobs, is preferable since it provides motivation and forces people to come to terms with the reality of the workplace. They say basic education or skills training should come later.
A year after joining the San Jose program, 46 percent of the women had jobs, according to Mathematica Policy Research Inc., a private company that evaluated all four sites. By contrast, the employment rate was only 36 percent for those San Jose women who applied for the program but were assigned at random to a control group and given no training.
The trained women earned an average of $416 a month, as against $283 for the others, or an hourly wage of $6.11, as against $5.39.
Some analysts speculate that stress on vocational education produces higher short-term gains while those given remedial education may thrive more in the long run. But the researchers say early studies show that the pattern persists after 30 months.
The center started in 1967 with a small grant from a church. Now it operates out of a sprawling former junior high school with a budget of $17 million and an alumni list reported at 50,000.
Its courses, which are supported by a variety of Government grants, include carpentry, child care, microelectronics assembly, printing, typing, cooking and shipping and receiving. Russell Tershy, who started the center and still runs it, lists several other keys to its success beyond the immediate immersion in tangible training, which costs about $3,500 per person.
 
Strengths of San Jose Method
 One factor, he said, is the reliance on an industrial advisory board, with representatives from dozens of the valley's top corporations. They keep the program current on what skills are needed and how to teach them. They also form a de facto placement network.
A second strength is the counseling and placement services, and here Ms. Covarrubias's experience is instructive.
Intimidated by the difficulty of running the sheet metal machines, she told her counselor, Ted Gonzales, that she wanted to try something easier. Mr. Gonzales, who has applied his you-can-do-it ethos here for two decades, told her she couldn't give up.
Ms. Covarrubias caught on.
Six months later, Mr. Gonzales donned the hat of the deal maker, inviting a supervisor from the metal products company to the school where he observed Ms. Covarrubias at work.
She was hired the next day.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Costly Citicorp Move To Win Over Investors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
In another sign of investor concern over the safety of investments in many major banks, Citicorp said yesterday that it would pay an unprecedentedly high rate on an important part of the capital it needs. The move will raise the company's costs substantially.
In agreeing to pay a dividend rate of 12.5 percent on a $100 million issue of preferred stock, the nation's largest banking company accepted a rate that is far higher than the dividend it was legally required to pay. The move was aimed at bolstering investor confidence, but it led to another drop in the company's stock price, to an eight-year low. 
 Concerns over real estate loans that might go bad if the nation enters a substantial recession have raised doubts about the credit quality of many major banks in recent weeks, and the rate action yesterday showed that those qualms have not receded. At the American Bankers Association meeting in Orlando, Fla., bankers said they were aware of a rising sense of unease among investors and depositors. [Page D2.]
 
High Rates Might Spread
 Citicorp has almost a billion dollars of such preferred shares outstanding, and the high rates are likely to spread to other Citicorp issues durng the next two months.
The 12.5 percent rate was set on an issue of "auction rate" preferred stock, and will remain in effect for seven weeks, when a new auction to reset the rate on that stock will be held. Had Citicorp wished to do so, it could have paid only 9.75 percent, but that would have meant that some investors who already owned the security would have been unable to sell it, angering those investors and damaging Citicorp's reputation.
Instead, Citicorp changed the rules of the auction, so that it could have been forced to pay a dividend rate as high as 16.25 percent. The auction produced a rate of 12.5 percent, which was well below the maximum level but still extraordinarily high. Since investments in preferred shares have tax advantages for corporate investors, the 12.5 percent rate is equivalent to a taxable rate of 17 percent.
By contrast, J. P. Morgan & Company, deemed by investors to be the healthiest of the major bank holding companies, auctioned a similar preferred issue yesterday at a rate of 6.069 percent, less than half the rate Citicorp will pay.
A Citicorp official called the 12.5 percent rate "a little high," but said the company would make a similar change in the rules on another preferred stock issue, whose rate is to be reset tomorrow. "We raised the cap to respond to investor concerns and see what would happen," said Nancy Newcomb, a senior corporate officer. "I think it will take some time for the markets to settle down."
The fact that Citicorp paid substantially less than the ceiling it had set was an indication that investors are not totally unwilling to accept the risk of investing in Citicorp. Yesterday's move will help to reassure investors that they will be able to sell such preferred stock at face value at the end of every seven-week period, because the company appears to be able to attract new investors at rates well below the new ceiling.
The Citicorp move was remarkable in that it represented an offer to pay more than it was contractually obligated to pay. It is roughly equivalent to Citibank, the banking subsidiary, telling an owner of a long-term certificate of deposit that the bank would raise the interest rate, out of the goodness of its heart.
If a similar policy is extended to all the company's preferred issues and Citicorp's credit standing continues to deteriotate, the additional annual dividend expense could be about $60 million, based on $950 million of such preferred outstanding. During the next seven weeks, yesterday's auction will cost Citicorp about $365,000 more than it was contractually obligated to pay on the $100 million issue.
Ms. Newcomb said Citicorp would "keep its options open" regarding whether it would make a similar offer on other issues. But the company is expected to do so.
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, shares of Citicorp fell 75 cents, to $11.875, after trading as low as $11.75, the lowest level for the shares since 1982.
What Citicorp did yesterday was announce plans to raise the maximum dividend rate on $100 million of auction rate preferred stock. Previously, that maximum was 1.2 times the commercial paper rate; the new limit is two times the commercial paper rate. Yesterday's auction resulted in a rate of 1.54 times the effective commercial paper yield of 8.128 percent. By contrast, the Morgan rate was only 0.75 times the commercial paper yield.
Here is how auction rate preferred stock works: The stock itself is perpetual, meaning the issuer has no obligation to redeem it, at any time. But holders are expected to view it as short-term paper, because the interest rate is reset at an auction every 49 days. At that auction, new buyers are supposed to indicate the minimum rate they would accept for the following 49 days, and the rate that is actually set is the lowest one that attracts buyers for all the stock at face value. Current holders have the choice of accepting the new auction rate or of selling out at face value.
That is, they have that option unless the auction fails, in which case the new rate is set at the maximum allowed under the auction rules. In such a case, some or all of the old holders would be unable to sell the paper.
On Monday, a Citicorp auction came very close to failing, as the auction produced a yield of 9.4 percent, or 1.15 times the commercial paper rate then prevailing. The belief in the market is that the auction probably would have failed had not the original underwriters of the issue, Goldman, Sachs & Company, stepped in and bid.
The reason that auction rate preferred stock has a 49-day reset period is to allow corporate holders to gain tax advantages that come only if stock is held for at least 45 days. With those advantages, a corporation pays only a 10.2 percent tax rate on the dividend, far below the 34 percent tax rate on regular corporate income.
Because of the tax aspects, the usual buyers of such securities are corporate treasurers, but in recent weeks they have shied away from the auctions, apparently because of fears about deteriorating credit quality at Citicorp and worries about liquidity if an auction should fail.
Although yesterday's auction was a success in that the Citicorp securities found buyers, the rate of 12.5 percent was above the range of 11 percent to 12 percent that had been cited by traders as the probable rate.
In the stock market, bank shares have been falling since early summer as worries over real estate loans have increased, but Citicorp's preferred stock auctions had gone relatively smoothly, with dividends of about 0.8 times the commercial paper rate until mid-September. But then, as Citicorp halted public auctions of its own commercial paper, and Chase Manhattan suffered the indignity of having to pay 13 percent on a bond issue that had a similar auction procedure, buyers began to back away.
Citicorp was forced to pay dividends that were higher than 0.9 times the commercial paper rate at several auctions from Sept. 19 through Oct. 10. On Oct. 12, the rate moved above the commercial paper rate. Market sources say that at all the auctions since then some of the shares were bought by investment banks that did not wish to see harm done to their customers who had previously bought the shares. In most cases, the investment banks later found other buyers. In addition to Goldman, the original lead underwriters of various issues were Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.

HEADLINE: In Connecticut Race for Governor, the Focus Is Economic

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 24

 BODY:
In speech after speech the candidates for governor talk about Connecticut's bleeding economy, often to the exclusion of all else.
It is an obsession, they say, that reflects reality: nothing else comes close in importance, especially in the minds of voters, to the question of which man is best equipped to lead during the recession that all three major candidates agree is here or probably soon will be. 
 Economists say balancing the state budget alone will present a herculean task. With companies earning less and peoplespending less, tax revenues have plummeted. This week, legislative analysts projected a shortfall of $1.5 billion over the next 18 months, or about 20 percent of the state's budget of just over $7 billion.
Housing starts continue to fall, down 34 percent in August from the same period a year ago; banks and insurance companies have been hit with stunning losses from real-estate investments, and defense contractors, a major part of the Connecticut economy, have laid off hundreds of workers. Defense industry forecasters see little likelihood of a return to the spending that marked the Reagan years.
A constant refrain from all the candidates is that Connecticut lost its competitive edgein the 1980's as a desirable place for companies to expand or relocate. And all three candidates portray themselves in varying degrees as the answer to the mistakes of the past.
 
'Tomorrow Is Here'
 "The crises that we confront today in the state of Connecticut are that everything was postponed until tomorrow, and tomorrow is here," said former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican who is running under his own Connecticut Party banner. "I don't know whether the person on the street is prepared for what needs to be done."
Mr. Weicker and his opponents -- Representative Bruce A. Morrison, the Democrat,and Representative John G. Rowland, the Republican -- agreed in a series of interviews with The New York Times that some pain will be necessary next year, in terms of spending cuts or tax increases or perhaps both. But there were sharp disagreements about where the next governor should start and what rays of hope could reasonably be expected.
Economists and business leaders similarly disagree about what the candidates have proposed, though most people who have analyzed the state's budget say whoever is elected will almost certainly have to go beyond what has been said in the campaign, given the depth of the state's problems.
"They're not open, and to tell you the truth, I don't think they know what they'll do," said Jean-Paul Valles, a senior vice president at Pfizer, one of the state's largest employers.
Among the main points of dispute are how best to protect and create jobs in the state, and halt the rising unemployment rate, which hit 5.1 percent in August, up from 3.7 percent in the summer of 1989.
The three candidates are running to succeed William A. O'Neill, the Democratic Governor, who decided not to seek re-election.
 
First Priority
 Mr. Morrison, who has represented New Haven and the Third Congressional District since 1983, said his first priority would be to stimulate the availability of credit and increase local business lending, which he believes has been restricted too harshly by Federal bank regulators called in to supervise the region's troubled banks.
His mechanism would be a partnership between banks and the state, which would guarantee some loans issued by the banks to businesses.
Without credit, he argues, businesses cannot expand and the recession spiral will deepen. He said he would also consider short-term borrowing, through bond sales, to bridge the state's budget gap next year.
Mr. Rowland and Mr. Weicker, by contrast, reject the idea of selling short-term bonds to tide the state over. Mr. Rowland, who has represented Waterbury and the Fifth Congressional District since 1985, said deep cuts in state spending, including renegotiation of all state-labor union contracts, must be the first order of business. He said the only alternative was to raise taxes, which he fears would deepen the recession and drive employers from the state.
Mr. Rowland specifically argues that state employee health benefits, which now pay 100 percent of a worker's medical expenses, are too generous. Reducing the state's portion to 80 percent, he said, would save hundreds of millions of dollars. If the unions refuse the givebacks on health care and other issues, including an extended workweek, thousands could be laid off, he said.
 
Corporate Tax Reduction
 Mr. Weicker, who was defeated for re-election in 1988 by Joseph I. Lieberman after 18 years in the United States Senate, proposes as his "first steps" a reduction in corporate taxes, which are the highest in the nation. He said immediate tax cuts, even if not financially significant, would send the message that the state wants to help employers weather the "economic winter" that he envisions.
All three candidates said they would put into place other mechanisms to ease the burden on businesses during the downturn -- like Mr. Rowland's pledge to businesses that "we'll leave you alone for two years" through a moratorium on new state business regulations -- and all three men said they would vigorously oppose any increase in taxes.
But Mr. Weicker appeared to come closest to saying tax increases of some sort might be required if the situation reached extremes. If the rising price of heating oil threatened poor families with freezing, for example, he said, "the decision is either to do nothing and allow that tragedy to occur or turn to the state and say, 'Here's the situation, will you support me?' "
Both Mr. Morrison and Mr. Rowland said cuts in business taxes, while a long-term goal in both their camps, were impractical for a least a year or perhaps longer. Cutting the rate sooner, as Mr. Weicker has suggested, would balloon the deficit further, they said.
Economists differ on whether Connecticut will be in better or worse shape than the rest of the region over the next few years. The state's economy, for example, has a greater diversity in its employment than much of the rest of New England, with major manufacturing plants existing alongside corporate headquarters and insurance towers. Unemployment, though rising, has still, except for one month earlier this year, been below the national average, as well as below the rate in New York City, which hit 7 percent this summer.
 
Risky Measures
 Many Connecticut residents also believe that new leadership in Hartford will in and of itself be a boost because a new governor could be more likely to take risky measures that just might work.
Then there is the theory that greater gloom could be good.
"One of the better things that might happen for Connecticut is an impending national recession," said Edward J. Deak, a professor of economics at Fairfield University. "If the whole United States economy were in recession, there would be efforts to prop it up by the Federal Government -- no action is going to be taken on just a regional basis."

HEADLINE: Southland In Chapter 11

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The Southland Corporation, owner of the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain, filed today for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, clearing the way for a takeover by the Ito-Yokado Company, a Japanese grocery chain, for $430 million in cash.
The filing came after seven fruitless months of trying to lighten Southland's massive debt load, taken on in the $4.9 billion leveraged buyout by its founding Thompson family in 1987. 
The Dallas-based company's drive-up stores will remain open as it tries to win approval from a bankruptcy court for a bankruptcy reorganization plan. In a Chapter 11 filing, a company wins protection from its creditors while it works up a plan to cut its debt.
The sale of 70 percent of Southland's stock to Ito-Yokado, which operates Southland's 7-Eleven stores in Japan, is contingent on completing the reorganization plan by next March 15.
As part of the plan, the company had been trying to get its bondholders to approve trading $1.8 billion in debt for stock and new bonds with lower interest rates.
But despite months of meetings, full-page newspaper advertisements and warnings that bankruptcy could not be avoided, holders of only 80 percent of the company's outstanding debt agreed to a swap, short of the required 95 percent.
Company officials said they believed the Bankruptcy court would approve its restructuring plan because it had secured enough exchange offers from bondholders to satisfy most court requirements.
Southland has asked that a bankruptcy court hearing for the confirmation of the plan be scheduled for Dec. 10. But analysts cautioned that once the court gets involved, the plan could be derailed.

Disney Forecasts Park Plan's Impact

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., Oct. 24

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company projected today that a proposed ocean theme park would attract 10 million visitors in its first year and employ 12,400 people. In July, Disney announced plans for Port Disney to be built here. The company is also considering building another park in Anaheim, home of the original Disneyland. Disney said it expected to decide next year whether to proceed with both plans.
The expected economic impact of a park in Long Beach was detailed in an independent analysis delivered to city and port officials. The Long Beach complex would include at least 3,700 hotel rooms and 250,000 square feet of retail space, the report said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Amid Pressure On Oil and Budget Fronts

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday against major foreign currencies after a string of recent gains.
"It was another failure for the dollar in its great struggle to go higher," said Robert White at First Interstate Bank. 
 The dollar bought 1.5055 German marks late in New York, off from 1.5190 late Tuesday. It fell to 126.50 Japanese yen from Tuesday's 128.15 yen.
The dollar came under pressure on several fronts: fresh signs of economic weakness, signs of progress on the budget in Washington and uncertainty in the Persian Gulf.
The belief that a Congressional pact to cut the Federal deficit would soon be reached pushed the dollar lower. A budget pact is expected to lead to lower interest rates, which would tend to make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
The Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has said the Fed will ease its grip on credit if a credible budget pact is reached.
Signs that the economy is weakening also put pressure on the dollar. The Government's report that durable orders tumbled 1.7 percent last month was also seen as increasing the need for lower interest rates.
"You really can't look for any reasons to buy dollars," Mr. White said.
After dropping sharply for several weeks, the dollar began to bounce back last Friday. But the rebound halted early yesterday, as traders began selling dollars, especially against the yen.
The dollar also weakened against the British pound, with the pound rising to $1.9595, from $1.9430 Tuesday.
The dollar fell against the Swiss franc, to 1.2695 from 1.2825, and the French franc, to 5.0400 from 5.0850.
The currency slipped to 1.1685 Canadian dollars, from 1.1720 on Tuesday.

Copper Prices Fall Sharply As Precious Metals Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures prices fell sharply yesterday, ending a four-day run-up, and precious metals rallied as a bounce in oil prices rekindled worries about the economy.
Copper futures settled 1.4 cents to 3.5 cents lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for spot delivery at $1.29 a pound, down 3.2 cents.
The selloff erased more than half of Tuesday's gains, which had been fueled by fears of a tight supply and perceptions that a drop in crude oil prices meant the United States economy might not be heading into a severe recession.
 
 Responds to Signals
 The copper market tends to respond to economic signals because copper is used widely in construction and manufacturing.
But oil prices leaped yesterday on several factors, including a reaffirmation by United States and Saudi Arabian leaders of their position that Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally.
Tim Evans, a copper trader with Deak International Inc., said copper's decline also reflected profit taking after a gain of about 9 cents a pound in four days.
Anne Orton, Deak vice president, said Far East demand for precious metals had increased as the dollar declined in value against other major currencies in the last few weeks.
 
 Spot Gold at $373.50
 Gold futures settled $2.10 to $2.30 higher on the Commodity Exchange, with the spot price at $373.50 a troy ounce, up from $371.20 on Tuesday; silver was 0.2 cent to 0.4 cent higher, with October at $4.223 a troy ounce.
Orange juice futures rose sharply in their fourth straight daily advance on the New York Cotton Exchange as the market continued to rebound from a collapse precipitated by an Oct. 11 prediction for a bumper Florida orange crop.
Orange juice rallied despite a prediction from the Florida Department of Citrus that retail prices for orange juice would drop nearly 12 percent in the coming year because of high Florida production and record world supplies.
Frozen concentrated orange juice futures ended 3.25 cents to 4.10 cents higher, with November at $1.19 a pound.
 
 Rumors Lift Grain Price
 Export sales rumors lifted corn and wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade but soybean futures fell slightly.
Reports that the Soviet Union has chartered freight vessels were regarded as an indication that Moscow will soon be shopping for grain, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
Wheat futures settled unchanged to 1 3/4 cents higher, with December at $2.64 3/4 a bushel. Corn was 1 1/4 cents to 2 1/2 cents higher with December at $2.33 a bushel. Oats were 1/4 cent lower to 1/4 cent higher, with December at $1.24 1/4 a bushel. Soybeans were unchanged to 3 3/4 cents lower, with November at $6.10 3/4 a bushel.
Cattle futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, helped by strong cash fundamentals including reports that steers fetched prices as high as $80.50 a hundredweight in western Kansas.

HEADLINE: The Bleak Numbers at Continental

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Even as Continental Airlines appears at last to be overcoming a reputation for bad service, financial problems are catching up with it.
The airline, the nation's fifth largest, built up a large debt in the mid-1980's as its parent company acquired troubled carriers, including People Express, Frontier Airlines and Eastern Airlines. But business was good enough for Continental to carry the burden of high acquisition costs, huge expenses to integrate the carriers, the defection of many travelers exasperated by lost bags and canceled flights, and employees still bitter about the mergers. 
 Now, however, industrywide problems are taking their toll. Fuel prices have more than doubled in the last two months, summer traffic was unusually slow and the parent company, Continental Airlines Holdings, was forced to pay $80.5 million last month as part of a settlement on liability for Eastern's pension plan.
Suddenly, the airline's $2.2 billion debt looms larger; it is about twice that of each of the three largest United States carriers, American, United and Delta, which are as much as twice Continental's size.
Among the alternatives the airline has considered was to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. But at a meeting on Monday, the board of the parent company rejected a bankruptcy filing. Hollis Harris, the president and chief executive of Continental Airlines Holdings, said yesterday that the board had unanimously rejected a bankruptcy filing and was now committed to exploring ways to cover additional expenses. In the short term, he said, Continental may borrow against aircraft orders; later, it may sell assets, like international routes.
Continental's worsening financial numbers stand in contrast to its improving figures for service. The complaint rate as compiled by the Department of Transportation has fallen from 38.6 per 100,000 customers in August 1987 to 9.74 in 1988, to 3.14 in 1989 and to 1.71 last August. In one category, baggage handling, Continental had the second-lowest complaint rate in August; it ranked sixth in August 1988.
Chris Witkowski, the director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Washington group that deals with complaints and issues of airline passengers, said that a few years ago Continental had the highest complaint rate but that it has dropped noticeably.
With such progress, Continental has in the last year or two won back a growing number of business passengers, having earlier attracted pleasure travelers through low fares. Among those business travelers is William S. Holland, who is in charge of international sales at Telesystems Source, a communications company in New Jersey. Until a year ago, he said, he tried to avoid Continental whenever possible. Now, said Mr. Holland, who travels about 100 days a year, he seeks out the airline.
"They have the best on-time record for my flights," he said. The service on board, he added, is now comparable to that of such carriers as United and American.
 
 The Food Wins Praise
 David Iby, another businessman who was picking up his bags at Newark International Airport, said he had also begun to take Continental whenever possible. "The girl was nice," he said, referring to the flight attendant in first class on his flight from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "The food was excellent, the flight was on time." Several other business travelers, who asked that their names not be used, also praised the carrier's service.
Continental's strategy of growth through the acquisition of ailing airlines was the work of Frank Lorenzo, who stepped down as chairman in August and sold his stock to Scandinavian Airlines System. Mr. Lorenzo won bankruptcy-court protection for the airline in 1982 and brought it out as a mostly nonunion carrier with lower operating costs.
The acquisitions have provided Continental with assets that have enabled it to remain in the race with the major carriers.
The acquisition of Eastern gave Continental access to a computer reservation system called System One. Continental's parent company, formerly the Texas Air Corporation, recently agreed to sell System One to Electronic Data Systems for $250 million; Eastern's unions are contesting the deal.
The acquisition of People Express gave Continental a major hub at Newark.
 
 A Link With S.A.S.
 The airline has linked up with S.A.S., which now owns 16.8 percent of the parent company. The link has borne results. Continental now brings connecting passengers to S.A.S. flights that leave from Newark's Terminal C.
Since the link with S.A.S., many of Continental's employees have attended the Swedish carrier's Quality Service Institute for two days of seminars and training on serving the traveler.
But Continental's growth has come at a price. The airline's annual interest cost is about $475 million while that of American, which is twice the size of Continental by revenue, is about $300 million.
It does not help Continental that much of its debt stems from acquisitions of other carriers; by contrast, American's debt is mostly for the purchase of new planes that are more fuel-efficient and can expand the carrier's service.
Mr. Harris would not disclose the airline's cash position yesterday, but said the carrier would have enough money to keep operating.
He said the cost of fuel for Continental was $80 million more than expected this month and had become a larger operating expense than labor. If fuel prices continue at present levels, he said, the airline would consider selling assets like some international routes.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Stay Strong, Up 10.9%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Sales of domestic vehicles rose 10.9 percent in mid-October, in sharp contrast with other indicators that point to a softening economy.
Several analysts said they continued to be puzzled by the relatively strong sales of vehicles since August, particularly when the economy appeared to be slowing down, based on economic indicators like declining disposable income and a sharp drop in housing starts. 
 On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 7.2 million, well ahead of the 6.1 million rate recorded in the period last year, and slightly ahead of the 7 million trend for 1990 to date.
Ten manufacturers sold 183,316 cars between Oct. 11 and 20, up 15.4 percent from 158,863 last year. Auto makers sold 98,633 light trucks, including mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles, a gain of 4.3 percent over last year's sales of 94,543. The figures exclude sales of imported cars and trucks, which are reported at the end of each month.
 
 Slump Did Not Materialize
 When the Persian Gulf crisis caused a run-up in gasoline prices and hastened a decline in consumer confidence, many analysts expected sales of cars and light trucks to deteriorate.
Instead, demand for new vehicles has remained fairly robust since mid-August. Vehicle sales have been helped by cash rebates and favorable financing, fleet sales and relatively modest price increases on 1991 models. Many people who bought vehicles in 1985 and 1986, when sales were strong, are in the market to replace their cars and light trucks.
But analysts said none of those factors fully explained the current strength.
"We don't know what is keeping the market up," said Harvey Heinbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "It goes against every indicator we are looking at."
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said he believed the soft economy would eventually cause auto sales to turn down. "We've seen a major deterioration in consumer confidence, and job formation has ground to a halt," Mr. Harris said. "But spending does not respond simultaneously to these factors. Historically, when these economic fundamentals go down, the demand for autos weakens. There's no reason that won't happen this time around."
 
Big Three Share Erodes
 The Big Three domestic auto makers continued to lose market share to Japanese auto makers with factories in the United States. The share of the car market claimed by the Big Three in mid-October fell to 84.7 percent from 87.7 percent last year.
The General Motors Corporation sold 80,571 cars, a gain of 15.1 percent from last year. G.M.'s light-truck sales rose 7.5 percent, to 40,691 units. Among G.M.'s divisions, Oldsmobile and Buick both posted sizable sales gains over last year, an increase that analysts attributed to new models and aggressive customer rebates offered on many 1990 and 1991 model cars and trucks.
The Ford Motor Company sold 51,357 cars in mid-October, up 9.3 percent from last year. Ford's light-truck sales increased 11.4 percent, to 34,707 units, carried by strong sales of its Explorer four-wheel-drive vehicle and Aerostar van.
 
Ford Cut Rebates
 Ford cut customer cash rebates to an average of $500 a model on Oct 1. Many Ford dealers complained that the move hurt showroom traffic and sales, and Ford subsequently offered dealer cash incentives on many cars and trucks. "There is still a large incentive for dealers to spur their sales by returning cash to customers," said Bill Carroll, a Ford spokesman.
Aggressive rebates lifted the Chrysler Corporation's car sales 5.6 percent over last year's levels, to 23,581 cars. But Chrysler's light-truck sales plunged 18.7 percent, to 18,631 units.
Chrysler said sales in its light-truck category were hurt by the changeover to new mini-van models, which caused the supply of Chrysler minivans to dwindle while factories shut down for retooling. Chrysler has also suffered a sharp drop in Jeep sales. Sales of Jeep's flagship Cherokee model are down 21 percent this yer, while sales of Ford's Explorer are 52 percent ahead of the Bronco II, the model that the Explorer replaced.
The Honda Motor Company sold 12,037 cars made at its factory in Marysville, Ohio, an increase of 44.1 percent over last year. The Toyota Motor Corporation increased sales of cars made in its Georgetown, Ky., plant by 47.3 percent, to 9,213 cars.

HEADLINE: Profit Slips 2.6% at Du Pont

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., Oct. 24

 BODY:
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company today reported a 2.6 percent drop in its third-quarter earnings, with increases in its petroleum operations offset by slower growth in the company's chemicals businesses.
The company reported net income of $533 million in the quarter, down from $547 million a year earlier. Earnings per share were flat at 79 cents and reflected the lower number of shares this year because of a stock-buyback program.
Revenues for the quarter were up 15.6 percent, at $9.93 billion, compared with $8.59 billion in 1989.
"Third-quarter results reflect strong performance from our petroleum operations," Du Pont's chairman, Edgar S. Woolard Jr., said. "At the same time, earnings in several of our chemical businesses continued to be adversely affected by the slowdown in the U.S. economy."
Du Pont said the improvement in petroleum earnings was partly a result of higher oil prices, which soared after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The company said 70 percent of the overall improvement was a result of operations overseas, where there was a strong demand for petroleum products and greater efficiency at the company's refineries.
Du Pont also said its quarterly results included gains of 8 cents a share from the sale of an interest in a North Sea oil property and an instrument systems business.
The company's shares were unchanged today at $34.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Ford's Credit Rating Drops a Notch

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service yesterday lowered by a notch the long-term rating on about $45 billion in securities issued by the Ford Motor Company, the Ford Motor Credit Company and subsidiaries.
The change leaves the car maker's rating at a high investment grade, but still serves as a signal that Moody's is concerned about the weakness in auto operations, the company's large capital requirements and the sizable acquisition debt that Ford accumulated during the year. 
In the last year Ford acquired the Associates Corporation of America for about $3.5 billion and Jaguar P.L.C. for about $2.5 billion. Moody's had placed Ford under review with negative implications on Sept. 18.
Moody's said the deterioratiing economic outlook in North America and the continuation of buyerincentive programs in the United States, expectations of continued soft demand in several European markets and the effect of volatile fuel prices heightened uncertainties about Ford.
Moody's said it had lowered the senior debt rating of the Ford Motor Company, the Ford Motor Credit Company, Ford Holdings Inc., Ford Capital B.V. and Ford Credit Funding P.L.C. to Aa-3, from Aa-2.
Analysts at Moody's said they do not have the General Motors Corporation or the Chrysler Corporation under review. The last rating change on Chrysler debt was in June, when it was downgraded to Baa-3, from Baa-2.
The Standard & Poor's Corporation said it does not have Ford under review. It lowered the auto maker's unsecured debt to AA-, from AA, in June.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money-Fund Yields Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday.
Analysts at Donoghue's said investors appeared to be unwilling to invest until a Federal budget was wrapped up. Then, they said, investors will likely wait for some interest-rate direction from the Federal Reserve in the form of some action on short-term rates. 
 Managers of tax-exempt money market funds said the average number of days that securities are held in portfolios remained at 56, where it has hovered for the last month.
Assets declined by $31 million, to total $82.7 billion, as the average seven-day tax-exempt compounded yield dropped 7 basis points, to 5.48 percent. The decline in yields is the result of a number of factors, analysts said, but mostly it is short-term rates have been softening, aided by a general relaxation of tension in the fixed-income market, by lower oil prices and by less negative news from the Middle East. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The 30-day compounded average yield slipped 3 basis points, to 5.66 percent. The equivalent taxable seven-day compounded yield is 7.61 percent for investors in a 28 percent tax bracket, and 8.44 percent for investors in the 33 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets of better than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Calvert Tax Free Reserve California portfolio fund produced the best return for the week, with a compounded average yield of 6.20 percent. The fund is distributed by the Calvert Group, Washington, D.C.
Elsewhere, assets of taxable funds rose by $802 million, to $407.7 billion, with institutional funds off by $2 million, to $87.9 billion, and consumer funds up by $804 million, to $319.8 billion. Analysts said that virtually all the gains in the taxable categories were in Treasury funds, where investors sought the soundness and stability of Government securities over the uneasiness of financial sector.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios rose one day, to 46.
Donoghue's said the seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund rose 2 basis points, to 7.73 percent, while the 30-day average yield is unchanged at 7.74 percent.
Of the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million, The Alger Money Market Portfolio had the best return for the second consecutive week, with a yield of 8.56 percent, up 3 basis points. The fund is managed by Fred Alger & Company, Jersey City.

Times Mirror Net Off 40.2%; Knight-Ridder Slides 3.2%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Company said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings dropped 40.2 percent from a year before, while Knight-Ridder Inc. reported its profit for the period slipped 3.2 percent from 1989 results, which included a one-time gain.
Times Mirror cited falling classified and retail advertising at The Los Angeles Times as well as at its newspapers in the economically troubled Northeast. 
 Knight-Ridder said that its newspaper operations were softer than expected and that newspaper ad revenue had worsened steadily. The company said its earnings from continuing operations were up from last year, excluding one-time gains on asset sales in 1989.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Times Mirror
Times Mirror, which is based in Los Angeles, earned $41.9 million, or 33 cents a share, on revenue of $895 million for the three months. That compared with $70.1 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue for the quarter rose 2.4 percent, to $895 million, from $873.9 million in last year's third quarter.
In addition to the ad decline at The Los Angeles Times and the continuing softness of advertising at newspapers in the Northeast, the newspaper publishing division had higher newsprint costs, said Times Mirror's chief executive, Robert F. Erburu.
"Our non-advertising-dependent businesses, led by our professional publishing operations, turned in solid third-quarter performances and should achieve revenue and earnings growth through the remainder of the year," Mr. Erburu said.
 
Knight-Ridder
Knight-Ridder, which is based in Miami, earned $36.6 million, or 73 cents a share, in the three months, compared with $37.8 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings per share were up because there were fewer outstanding.
Revenue rose 5.5 percent, to $570.5 million, from $541 million a year earlier.
The 1989 results included a $4.2 million gain from the sale of television stations. Earnings from continuing operations this year were up 7.7 percent if that gain is excluded from the comparison.
Operating profit in the newspaper division was up 5 percent, to $82.4 million, while the business information services division had an operating profit of $3.9 million compared with $2.5 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: 'Great Books' Takes In Moderns and Women

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Almost 40 years after the "Great Books of the Western World" was published to wide critical acclaim, the collection of many of the seminal works of almost 3,000 years of Western civilization has been given an editorial facelift. Homer, Shakespeare, Plato and John Stuart Mill are still represented, but for the first time they will share the grandeur with 20th-century writers. And for the first time, women will be included. The 60 volumes that make up the revised "Great Books," published by the Encyclopaedia Britannica , is to be introduced this morning at the Library of Congress. Later today, William F. Buckley Jr. is to lead a panel of scholars in a discussion of the impact of 20th-century authors on Western thought. 
 But with no blacks represented among the 130 authors and only 4 newly chosen women -- Jane Austen, Willa Cather, George Eliot and Virginia Woolf -- the revision seems likely to intensify criticism that any such claims to greatness are expressions of Western cultural bias by and in behalf of white males.
Of the 20th-century authors chosen for the "Great Books," 43 are men, including Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, William Faulkner, Samuel Beckett, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Thomas Mann, George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway.
 
Twain and Nietzsche Added
 The revised "Great Books" also adds 15 notables who were passed over last time, among them Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Anton Chekhov, Henrik Ibsen, John Calvin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Alexis de Tocqueville and Voltaire.
"It distresses me that the editors couldn't find more women and persons of color to include in this new edition," said Henry Louis Gates Jr., a professor of English literture at Duke University. "Especially after all of the debates over the last few years about the relationship of historically excluded voices to the reshaping of the canon for the 21st century. Obviously, there's still a 'whites only' sign on what precisely constitutes a great thinker."
Professor Gates said he was especially disturbed by the failure to include W. E. B. Du Bois. "He was not only one of the pioneering figures in the creation of American sociology," he said, "but he was arguably the most important African-American intellectual in history."
Mortimer J. Adler, the editor in chief of the "Great Books," agreed that Du Bois was a prominent intellectual. "But his most important book, his autobiography, does not meet all three of the criteria established for inclusion," he said.
Those criteria are that the books be relevant to the contemporary world, be worth re-reading and deal with the great ideas that confront mankind in every age. Those ideas are arranged in 102 categories in 2 volumes titled the "Syntopicon," a word chosen by Dr. Adler meaning a collection of topics. The categories range from angel to world, and include democracy, infinity, life and death, metaphysics, punishment, theology and war and peace.
 
Denies Elitism
 Dr. Adler pointed out that books by Du Bois, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Alice Walker and other black writers are cited as recommended reading at the end of many chapters in the "Syntopicon." He predicted that blacks will be represented in the "Great Books" themselves in subsequent editions, and women in larger numbers. "But they came very late into the picture," he said. "Before the 19th century, for instance, there were almost no women and black writers."
Dr. Adler also denied that the selection was elitist, but said that it was Eurocentric, reflecting much of the accumulated wisdom of the Western world. "In the 22d or 23d century," he said, "we may get around to publishing the Great Books of the World."
The revised edition drops four people: Henry Fielding and Laurence Sterne, the English writers; Apollonius, the epic poet of Alexandria and Rhodes, and Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, the French mathematician and physicist. It also offers newer translations of 57 works by 13 authors, including "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" by Homer.
Until now, the "Great Books of the Western World" was unchanged since its original publication in 1952. That edition was edited by Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, the president of the University of Chicago, with the assistance of Dr. Adler. It consisted of 54 volumes, 74 authors and 443 works.
Reviewing the original edition on the front page of The New York Times Book Review, on Sept. 14, 1952, Gilbert Highet, a professor of Latin at Columbia University, wrote, "Taken all together, they are a noble monument to the power of the human mind." But he said that it was an "arbitrary collection." And as if anticipating present-day criticisms, he wrote, "In times like ours it is plainly impossible for 10 or 12 men, working in one single tradition, to select and to explain all the greatest books of the 3,000-year-old and 10,000-mile-wide West."
 
Editorial Advisers
 That first edition evolved under an advisory board of seven American scholars as well as one consultant each from Canada, England and Australia. The editorial board for the current "Great Books" was Douglas Allanbrook, senior tutor and associate dean of St. John's College, Annapolis, Md.; Jacques Barzun, provost emeritus of Columbia University; Norman Cousins, professor of medicine, University of California at Los Angeles; John Kenneth Galbraith, professor of economics, Harvard University; Heinz R. Pagels, who died in 1988, director of the New York Academy of Sciences, and Lord Quinton, former chairman of the British Library in London. Clifton Fadiman and Philip W. Goetz served as associate editors.
The current 16-member committee of consultants includes Mr. Buckley, Stephen Jay Gould, Daniel Bell and Isaac Asimov, as well as Octavio Paz, the Mexican poet and writer who earlier this month won the Nobel Prize in Literature, along with scholars from England, Australia, Canada, France and Japan. Among the consultants is a woman, Dame Leonie Kramer, professor of Australian literature, University of Sydney, and an African, Prof. Alexander A. Kwapong, a Ghanian who teaches international development at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia.
The books, sold only in sets, cost about $1,400 in their least expensive binding. Like the Encyclopaedia Britannica, they are sold by subscription and will also be sold by Britannica representatives in many supermarkets and in about 120 stores of the Waldenbooks chain.

HEADLINE: Give Tax Incentives to Hire the Unemployed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics through August 1990 show 1.842 million white-collar workers unemployed, an increase of 364,000 in 12 months. With an average wait between jobs of 7 months, the prospect for most of an early return to employment is not good.
These figures show a large continuing waste of the country's trained intellectual talent. Much of this talent has been fine-tuned over the years to meet the needs of a particular corporate situation. This specialization makes job changing at the same level of skill difficult.
The obvious reason for the slow return to employment is an economy in the doldrums, without clear movement toward growth. The deeper reasons for prolonged unemployment are important to grasp, if the United States is to set its course toward full employment of both white-collar and blue-collar workers.
To be kept in mind are implications of the familiar truism in economics that corporations are governed by short-run self-interest. With a slump in sales, streamlined operations from mergers or improved technology, corporations cut their employment to make as much profit as they can. They are unmoved by the problem of those pushed into prolonged unemployment or by the economic principle that such cuts bleed the purchasing power that generates full employment and prosperity.
Why should corporations share economic opportunity with those out of work unless it is profitable to do so? Somehow, in the decade of the 1990's, we must develop a strategy for using our full work potential within the framework of self-interest.
What started pulling the economy out of the Great Depression was sharing enough money with the jobless through unemployment compensation and made-work projects for consumer spending to rise, and thatbrought the jobless back to their regular work. Then World War II generated full employment.
Giveaways or wars are costly ways of getting out of a recession. The same result can be gained by providing immediate incentives for each corporation to hire those out of work and qualified to work. Such employer incentives are easily understood and readily enacted as part of tax laws.
(1) The incentive can take the form of giving the employer credit against the tax for unemployment insurance for each unemployed person hired.
(2) Or, as a stronger incentive, let the employer receive a tax-credit amounting to 10 percent or 20 percent of salaries paid to the unemployed people they hire. This credit can be provided as a deduction allowed from the tax on corporation profits during the first year of fresh employment.
The costs of such incentives are not much more than the costs of prolonged unemployment, not to mention the human price paid by families thus unjustly devastated.
In the tax-offset proposal, instead of money handed out to those who are idle, people are paid for productive work, increasing the security and prosperity of others. What is paid out in increased payrolls generates increased purchasing power and comes back to producers in a rising spiral of corporate profits and higher incomes for people generally. With a happy, industrious and creative work force, the United States can meet and excel business competition elsewhere on the globe.

HEADLINE: Coleman's Agent Reports Accord With Nets

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The Nets and Derrick Coleman have agreed in principle to a five-year, $15 million contract that will make Coleman the highest-paid rookie in the history of the National Basketball Association, Coleman's agent said tonight.
 Harold MacDonald, Coleman's agent, said that the two sides would make the contract language final on Thursday, and added that his client must also pass a physical examination. 
 "It's done," he said. "It's business and it's not fun, but it's done."
Willis Reed, a Nets senior vice president, said tonight when reached at home: "I'm not going to say 'yea' or 'nay' until it's done. We can't comment on that."
The agent said the first four years of the proposed contract were guaranteed and the Nets had an option for the fifth year. He said Coleman could wind up making as much as $16 million with incentives for benchmarks such as being voted the league's rookie of the year and his totals for blocked shots and rebounds.
"We have basically come to an agreement in terms of economics," said MacDonald in a telephone interview from his Bloomfield Hills, Mich., home tonight. "It's just lawyers talking to talking lawyers now. There shouldn't be any sticking points."
Coleman, the No. 1 selection in the college draft this year, missed rookie camp and the first 19 days of training camp while disagreeing with the Nets over his contract. The team was reluctant to pay an unproven rookie $3 million per year, but MacDonald said he and Jerry Cohen, one of the Nets' owners, agreed to the economic terms of the contract this afternoon.
John Mertz, a Nets spokesman, said team officials were wary of making any statement because they thought Coleman had been signed on two other occasions.
MacDonald left no doubt that Coleman would soon be on his way from his home in Detroit to East Rutherford, N.J.
Reed, Cohen and Bob Casciola, another senior vice president, were supposed to attend tonight's exhibition game here with Minnesota. When the executives did not arrive at Knickerbocker Arena, it signified that something was in the air.
Bill Fitch, the Nets' coach, hinted at a possible Coleman signing after a 90-83 victory.
"They're not down here, which means they're working," Fitch said. "I take that as a good sign."
MacDonald said Coleman had an offer from Europe that would have paid him $1 million per season after taxes but that the former Syracuse star was intent on playing in the N.B.A.
"At this point, it's a good contract," MacDonald said. "It gets him his $15 million. and he could get another million with incentives. It's what we've wanted all along."
If the contract details are sorted out by Thursday, Coleman will accompany the Nets to Calgary, Alberta, where they have preseason games against the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday and Saturday nights.
"He's ready to get fitted for a uniform and get on a plane and go to Canada," MacDonald said. "We got him the best deal possible."

HEADLINE: Boat People Lacking in Teachers of English

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A few days ago I visited the Pillar Point camp in Hong Kong, which houses 5,000 Vietnamese boat people who have qualified for resettlement in the West.
It seems probable that the great majority of the Vietnamese living at Pillar Point will almost certainly be resettled in English-speaking countries. Between Jan. 1 and Sept. 1, 4,100 of the 5,100 refugees who left Hong Kong for settlement in the West went to English-speaking countries -- Australia, Canada, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.
The accommodation at Pillar Point is adequate, and many of the refugees have obtained temporary jobs in Hong Kong for wages that are opulent by Vietnamese standards. Unfortunately, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is facing a severe financial crisis in Hong Kong, and all adult education at the Pillar Point camp has stopped.
Many future readjustment problems could be eased if the Vietnamese refugees at Pillar Point could be given training in English. Many of them are eager to learn, but they have no teachers.
In the past, a number of American organizations concerned with the plight of the Vietnamese boat people have been critical of the way in which the camps in Hong Kong have been run. If these organizations were now to help finance the provision of a few competent teachers of English at Pillar Point, they would be making a constructive gesture that would help smooth the path of many men, women and children who are going to live in America.
The Government of Hong Kong is otherwise heavily committed to providing basic education in its other camps for the Vietnamese boat people.

HEADLINE: After Nearly 2 Years on a Tightrope, Elizabeth Dole Resigns Labor Post

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

 BODY:
There were not many workplace issues that Labor Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole failed to make a speech about: the rights of women and minorities, pension rights, child labor abuses, worker safety, worker training, the minimum wage. And to proponents of workers, she said most of the right things, too. But little of what Mrs. Dole said before she resigned yesterday as the highest-ranking woman in the Bush Administration brought noteworthy changes in Government policies.
Mrs. Dole, who will become president of the American Red Cross, was caught up in the conflict between being part of a pro-business Republican Administration, on the one hand, and the head of a department that historically has served as an advocate for organized labor. She set a warmer tone toward labor and its Congressional partisans, who saw Mrs. Dole, rightly or not, more as one of themselves than the White House would let her be. 
 The president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, Lane Kirkland, said yesterday that Mrs. Dole "did her best to represent the working people and their unions in a Republican Administration."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Senate labor committee, praised her for many worthwhile achievements and said, "It cannot have been easy serving as a pro-labor Secretary in an anti-labor Administration."
Mrs. Dole is receiving such salutes even though she resisted organized labor's appeals to intervene in two bitter strikes, at Greyhound and Eastern Airlines. She intervened in just one, the Pittston coal strike in Appalachia last year, and was instrumental in helping to settle it. But she ignored labor's biggest complaint: strikebound management's growing use of substitute workers to replace permanently those who walk out.
 
Rapport With Labor
 Perhaps it is more her manner than her views that accounted for her easy rapport with labor. In dealing with organized labor, she said in an telephone interview today. "There are issues where you have to disagree. But there's a lot of common ground."
William H. Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, said, "She's the type to sit down with you and give you an opportunity to change her mind."
The issue that Mrs. Dole considers the most important of her 21-month tenure is the quality of the American work force and evidence that American youth have fallen behind Japanese and European youth in skills. This topic is also one that opens her to criticism for more talk than leadership.
Since midway through the Reagan Administration, Cabinet agencies have been studying the issue, and Mrs. Dole has appointed yet another commission. "So far," said Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, the research organization, "that issue has not resulted in any concrete or specific policy proposals." But Mrs. Dole said her commission was now about to produce "actionable items and concrete proposals."
Labor leaders and Congressional aides say that Mrs. Dole, despite a low profile, led the Administration in negotiating last year the increase in the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $3.80, which took effect in April, and to $4.25, effective next April. But the increase was far less than Democrats and organized labor had sought -- so small, indeed, that few workers have been affected.
Women's groups say that while Mrs. Dole shows a sound grasp of the problems facing them -- the cost of child care, the average gap of 30 percent between women's pay and that of men, a family's cost of having children -- she has taken little initiative to help. Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington, said the White House had steadfastly opposed helping out in those areas.
"I sort of think she could have done more," Ms. Hartmann said. "We would have wished she had been more effective in arguing for these policies, but that might have been an awful lot to expect of this Administration."
Where Mrs. Dole could use the administrative powers of her office, she was able to be more responsive, many people said. She moved women, blacks and Hispanic people into the top levels of the Labor Department. An official there said today that more than 60 percent of the department's 200 or so political appointees were women.
Mrs. Dole strengthened enforcement of the child labor laws with four nationwide raids on employers to uncover cases of children's working excessive hours or with dangerous machines, and she increased the fines for violations. She also increased the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's corps of compliance officers, the first additions in nearly a decade, and proposed the biggest fine ever for a company's abuses of safety regulations: more then $7 million against the USX Corporation.
To the praise of women's groups, Mrs. Dole recently started an initiative to use the the civil rights laws and the Government's power to award and withhold contracts to induce businesses to move more women and minorities into the upper reaches of management.
Mrs. Dole declined to say whether the frustrations of getting such initiatives off the ground drove her out. The presidency of the Red Cross, she said, provided an opportunity to make a difference in people's lives. "It's an opportunity that's here, right now," she said. "It won't be here next year."
 
Speculation on Candidacy
 Mrs. Dole and President Bush appeared together yesterday in the White House briefing room, where Mr. Bush announced that he was accepting her resignation "with real deep regret." The President praised Mrs. Dole, saying that as Secretary of Labor, "she's made the workplace safer, healthier and more secure."
After Mrs. Dole thanked Mr. Bush for his "faith and confidence," she was asked if she was now going to run for governor of North Carolina, as has been speculated. "I am on my way to the Red Cross," she said. "I have no plans to run for anything."

HEADLINE: Chicago Opera's Chief Has a Mission

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Last October the Lyric Opera of Chicago shocked the American opera world with a bold announcement. Starting this season -- on Saturday, to be exact -- the company would present a decade-long "celebration" of 20th-century opera, offering 20 major scores from both Europe and the United States, including three commissioned American world premieres.
The program, entitled "Toward the 21st Century," was a shock because for most big American opera companies, dependent on presumably conservative subscribers, innovation beyond tokenism has been very rare. The Houston Grand Opera has a reputation for boldness, but not on this scale. For the most part, it has been left to such compact, festival-like operations as Santa Fe and St. Louis to carry the torch for operatic innovation. 
 None of which daunts Ardis Krainik, who has spent her entire professional life with the Lyric Opera. Its general director since 1980, she is an old-style operatic impresario, meaning that she and no one else makes the final artistic decisions. She has an artistic director, the Italian conductor Bruno Bartoletti. But it is the 61-year-old Miss Krainik at whose desk the buck stops. Such centralized authority compares sharply with the situation at New York's Metropolitan Opera, which aside from its genteel conservatism of policy has had to contend with a muddled administrative structure in recent years.
Miss Krainik's initiative involves both the main company and its adjunct Lyric Opera Center for American Artists. The center has already presented Hugo Weisgall's "Six Characters in Search of an Author," in June, and in the spring will perform a commissioned world premiere of its own by Bright Sheng, the company's composer in residence.
 
Argento Work Is First
 But it is the main-stage activity that naturally commands the greater attention. That gets under way on Saturday evening with a new production of the Minnesota composer Dominick Argento's 1976 opera, "The Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe." The first of the big company's commissioned premieres, William Bolcom's "McTeague," is scheduled for the 1992-3 season.
In person, this innovative impresario hardly seems an avant-garde firebrand, determined to ram 20th-century opera down the unwilling throats of a dwindling band of disgruntled subscribers. She was raised in Manitowoc, Wis., and attended Northwestern University. She also studied singing, to the annoyance of her parents, and signed on as a secretary at the fledgling Lyric Opera in the hope of being allowed to sing. She did sing, in the chorus and in small solo parts, but she soon discovered she had a flair for administration.
By 1975, she had become artistic administrator under the general director, Carol Fox. But in 1980, with Miss Fox ill and the company in financial straits, Miss Krainik almost became the director of the Australian Opera in Sydney. At the last moment -- to hear her tell it, she was poised on the tarmac, Qantas ticket in hand -- the Chicago board pursuaded Miss Fox to retire and offered Miss Krainik the chance to stay at home.
In talking with her, one gets the impression that while the 10 European operas on her docket are important, that her heart is with the American scores.
"I want American opera to reach its zenith," she said, almost as if she were leading a pep-talk at a business seminar. "I think it can blossom in the next 10 years. We have to have our own, unique American opera, not just a hashed-over European art form. I think now is the time, and I want to be behind making it flower."
 
Challenges Audiences
 American opera impresarios, bereft of the government support and innovative tradition that their European counterparts enjoy, typically justify their conservatism by portraying themselves as the humble servants of their audiences.
Miss Krainik will have none of that. She has already offered her audiences challenging novelties, from operas by Alban Berg and Philip Glass to productions by Peter Sellars and, this year, Robert Wilson.
"I don't think of myself as a humble servant," she said. "I want to bring this public along. After 'Satyagraha' and 'Lulu,' they're ready for this program. 'Poe' is a good show; people are going to come as if it were 'Les Miserables.'
"I want my audience to be happy with what I do; I want them to have a good time. That's the only hope for American music -- that audiences will love it. My job as the steward of this company is to present to Chicago audiences the best in this field. If I don't do that, I'm cheating my public. I turn handstands to get the best people here, following the principle that the audience must be served, and that way you serve your art form."
 
Barenboim and Mehta
 Although "Toward the 21st Century" is conceived as a 10-year program, only the first few years have been announced. In addition to "Poe" and "McTeague," Miss Krainik will offer a new production of Samuel Barber's "Antony and Cleopatra." Plans for the European portion of the venture include Prokofiev's "Gambler," Debussy's "Pelleas et Melisande," and a Berg 'Wozzeck' to be conducted by Daniel Barenboim, the music director-designate of the Chicago Symphony, and staged by Patrice Chereau. Miss Krainik calls that one "hands across the Loop." Almost in passing, when she announced this project last fall, she also mentioned that there was to be a new Wagner "Ring" cycle conducted by Zubin Mehta.
Beyond that, however, she has kept her cards close to her vest. That reflects in part a desire to keep her options open. But it also counts as a reality check in a recessionary economic climate.
"Every smart manager has to have a fallback position, and we do," she said. "No matter what happens, we will still have an opera company, and I don't think anything will happen to this initiative, either, because we have it funded already for the first four or five years." That financing includes an unusually large $1 million challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.
With the acclaim her company's success has brought her and with her growing impact in the cultural life of Chicago and the nation (she is the new president of Opera America, the organization of American opera companies), one might think Miss Krainik would betray hints of arrogance. She fights against that, and her weapon is religion. Since 1961, she has been a devout Christian Scientist, and she is eager to tell listeners of her faith.
"In every opera company, there are things over which you have no control," she said. "When a crisis comes along, you listen to your colleagues, but you also listen to that still, small voice. It's leveling. You don't think you're the big cheese, because the big cheese is up there."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
New Group Makes the Case for Black Agencies and Media

 BODY:
SOME of the biggest black-owned advertising agencies and media companies have formed a trade organization, the African American Marketing and Media Association, hoping to increase advertising to black audiences, alter what it sees as stereotyping and find more work for its members.
The group plans to get in touch with advertisers that it thinks could use black representation on the account and creative sides. 
 "We know instinctively what will offend our audience, because we are our audience," said Ken Smikle, president of the organization and publisher of Target Market News, a national trade publication about black marketing. "What works creatively for whites won't necessarily work for blacks. It's time to say we are the experts and will no longer be ignored."
The members of the Chicago-based organization include New York and Chicago advertising and public relations firms, as well as publishing houses and black radio networks.
Through its research, the organization hopes to encourage advertisers to place more advertising in media intended for black audiences.
"Our media has always been underutilized," said the association's chairman, Clarence O. Smith, president and co-founder of Essence Communications. "There probably is no media more persuasive with its audience than black media."
The group will soon begin substantial research about black consumers that it plans to disseminate widely. "The data on black consumers has been no more than an asterisk," Mr. Smikle said. "You cannot go to a mall and interview a thousand consumers and have the 10 percent who happen to be black reflect accurate information about the group."
Black Americans spend an estimated $63 billion annually.
"The need for this organization was exacerbated by the growing number of so-called experts who have no track record in this area of marketing," Mr. Smikle observed.
He mentioned BBDO, which released a report last year entitled "Black Readers of Consumer Publications" that drew what he thinks were inaccurate conclusions.
"The BBDO study concludes that advertisers can reach black consumers just as effectively with white publications such as Parade as they could with such publications as Ebony," Mr. Smikle said. "As in most studies of the black consumer, their methodology is inadequate. There's no psychographic data that gets to the heart of why black consumers make certain purchasing decisions."
Doug Alligood, vice president of special markets for BBDO, New York, who was in charge of the analysis for the study, denied it undermined the importance of black media. "What we found was that Parade reaches as many black readers as Ebony, but that it wouldn't make economic sense to use just Parade if you want to reach black consumers exclusively," he said. "We freely acknowledge that it was an analysis of numbers only."
Another goal of the new organization is to find ways to combat sterotypical portrayals of blacks in advertising or what some executives at black-owned media companies see as insidious racism in advertising.
"For example, there is a Nike public service anti-drug ad that features basketball player David Robinson," Mr. Smikle said, "in which words like stupid and garbage are used to describe people in the target audience. We would never speak to ourselves like that."
Liz Dolan, a spokeswoman for Nike, denied the ads were patronizing or the language even accidentally inappropriate. "We were trying to be very strong and we wanted the ad to be strong," she said. "The ad is powerful because it's clear how David Robinson personally feels about how dangerous drugs are.
"The ad is addressed to anyone who watches television. None of our ads are targeted at a specific racial group. The appeal of athletes is universal."

Bell Atlantic Plans Earnings Charge

 BODY:
The Bell Atlantic Corporation said it would take a one-time charge against its fourth-quarter earnings of about $40 million, or 10 cents a share. The charge will reduce the value on Bell Atlantic's books of the company's non-telephone financial services, which include equipment leasing and lending to other companies and real estate projects.
Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, said that the businesses were doing well and had no credit problems but that their market value had fallen. Marion M. Boucher, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., said Bell Atlantic's investments outside the telephone industry now appeared more vulnerable to an economic downturn than many investors had thought. Bell Atlantic's stock fell 87.5 cents yesterday, to $50.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.

A Budget Accord None Too Soon

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH and the leaders of Congress have decided to end the bruising battle of the budget, though some right-wing guerrillas have vowed to take to the woods and go on fighting against any tax increases as long as they can hold out. But the President and Congressional leaders have grown increasingly wary of the anger of voters over the inability to reach agreement on governing the nation's finances. And they are worried about the danger that the protracted political warfare poses for the weakened national economy.
Legislators who vote for this legislation will do so holding their noses for varying reasons. Some will say it raises gasoline taxes too much, others that it raises them too little to improve conservation and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Some dislike the plan because it hits Medicare too hard, others because it does not hit Medicare and other entitlement programs hard enough. And the plan defers the question of how to reorganize the military budget in light of the reduced Soviet threat and new threats like those in the Middle East. 
 Nevertheless, the budget agreement does deal with one of the most serious threats to the American economy: rising uncertainty that the United States has the will to tackle the deficits that have undermined its productivity and growth, hampered its ability to finance its commitments and made it dangerously dependent on foreign capital.
By reducing Government's drain on national savings, this budget plan will curb the upward pressure on interest rates. The Federal Reserve is now in a better position to ease monetary policy and help bring down interest rates. The ability of the Fed to move fast is complicated by the weakness of the dollar, the rise of interest rates abroad and inflationary pressures from higher oil prices. Still, the Fed may wait for the markets' response to the budget agreement before it steps in forcefully to relax monetary policy.
But if the markets do register approval of this move as a decisive step toward fiscal discipline, the ability of American banks and corporations to finance their heavy debts will be markedly enhanced, and interest rates will begin to fall.
The budget agreement, assuming it is voted into law, will eliminate only one of the big uncertainties hanging over the domestic and world economy. Another is the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the oil shock. It is hard to foresee an early return to normalcy that would bring oil back to its pre-invasion average price of $16.40 a barrel. The oil price has become a yo-yo, jerked up and down by rumors of war or a peace that might flow from an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
Anxieties are widespread inside the Government that if a deal is made that permits Saddam Husseinto remain the leader of Iraq, he would use the next few years to strengthen his position and his weapons, and would continue to use the oil weapon. But war would be economically costly, too. It would send the price of oil soaring -- to $65 a barrel, according to one World Bank study, and to $100 or more, according to some oil experts, who fear the threat to Saudi oilfields and refineries.
The United States military buildup in Saudi Arabia is intended, in part, to safeguard the world's oil supply at prices that would not wreck the world economy. In addition, Washington could use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep oil prices from going to the sky.
So the United States is still keeping the war option open. Some officials maintain that a war, drawing on overwhelming American military strength, would quickly eliminate the Iraqi threat. The effect on oilfields in the area, they say, would not be long-lived. Nevertheless, the uncertainties about American intentions are likely to keep the oil market nervous and jumpy for months.
Differences with France and Germany over how to handle Iraq together with trade conflicts are straining American relations with Europe. The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, under the General Agreement on Tarriffs and Trade, is in jeopardy mainly as a result of the European Community's opposition to changing its agricultural policy as well as Japan's resistance to importing rice. If the Europeans and Japanese refuse to move on agriculture, American officials foresee a "bumpy" end to the talks in two months -- and powerful pressures for protectionism in Congress.
A deep recession and mounting unemployment would worsen protectionist pressures and deal a severe blow to world trade. That is why the budget agreement, in clearing the way for lower interest rates, is so crucial as a counter-recessionary force and a measure to build confidence in America, here and around the world.

Moody's Upgrades Debt of Duquesne

 BODY:
The rating on about $2 billion of debt issued by the Duquesne Light Company, Pittsburgh, was raised yesterday by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
The company's first-mortgage bonds and secured pollution-control securites were increased to Baa-1, from Baa-2.
Moody's cited a strengthening of the company's financial picture and its belief that Duquesne's earnings were likely to remain above the level needed to finance the company's modest construction program and permit steady reductions in outstanding debt.
The rating agency said diversification in the company's service territory should counter the potential effects of a weak economy.

HEADLINE: Plant Sale Aids Whirlpool Net

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BENTON HARBOR, Mich., Oct. 25

 BODY:
The Whirlpool Corporation said today that its third-quarter profits rose 27.6 percent but that the gain resulted from the sale of a Kentucky plant.
For the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, the appliance maker said net income totaled $60 million, or 86 cents a share, up from $47 million, or 68 cents a share, from the comparable period a year ago.
Without the sale of the vacuum cleaner plant in Danville, Ky., profits would have plummeted 21 percent, to $37 million, the company said. The plant is now part of a venture between Whirlpool and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company.
Revenue in the quarter grew 10.6 percent, to $1.66 billion, from $1.5 billion in the 1989 period.
David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool's chairman and chief executive, attributed the decline in profits to the weakening North American economy, which has softened the demand for appliances. He expects industrywide United States shipments of appliances to be down about 8 percent for the year.
Whirlpool's stock fell 12.5 cents today, to $19.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Poor Results in Two Sales
 The auction results at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York this week were up one day for jewelry and way down on another day for 19th-century European art. For the first time in years, in fact, dealers described the art sales at the major New York houses as "disasters."
The numbers were indeed grim: the totals realized for the European art auctions at both Sotheby's and Christie's were about half or one-fourth of what these houses had estimated they would be. 
 At Sotheby's, two 19th-century art sales of almost equal value were held on Tuesday, offering European paintings, drawings and sculpture in one and Scandinavian art in the other. These sales were expected to bring, in all, $29.4 million to $39.3 million; the combined total was $7.7 million. Of the two, the Scandinavian sale was more disappointing: 28 works were sold of the 107 offered, for a total of $1.5 million in a sale that was expected to bring $15.2 million to $20.3 million.
Hans Dylens, who heads Sotheby's office in Stockholm, attributed the problems of the sale to the sharp downturn in the Swedish economy in recent weeks. "Inflation has increased 5 percent in recent days," he said. "Wages are up, foreign trade is down."
Christie's auction of 19th-century art on Wednesday offered 356 works estimated by the house to bring $9.5 million to $13.8 million. At the sale, 191 works were sold for a total of $4.9 million.
"A lot of speculative 19th-century pictures have met their maker," said Guy Stair Sainty, a New York dealer. "The speculators have disappeared like the sun goes down at night. This is a great time to buy. Now you no longer have to double the top estimates to buy what you want."
Mr. Sainty questioned the presale estimate of $400,000 to $600,000 on Jean-Leon Gerome's "Marcus Botsaris," a painting in Sotheby's sale that did not sell on Tuesday. "The owner bought it a few months ago in Chicago for $250,000," Mr. Sainty said. "There is obviously a feeling of caution in the market. You can sell great international masters -- Corot and Delacroix. But Gerome is very much a second-rate painter. He has a certain place in 19th-century art, but it is nonsense that a Gerome should be estimated to bring $400,000 to $500,000."
Diana D. Brooks, the president of Sotheby's North America, said one major problem at this sale was that dealers did not support this market. "Right now they do not want to invest in inventory," she said. "They are not going to buy unless they have a buyer for a painting."
What will Sotheby's do about future sales of such art? "They will be much smaller," Mrs. Brooks said. "People aren't going to be as willing to sell in this market."
"Most of the pictures were known to the trade," said Adam Williams, the director of Newhouse Galleries in Manhattan. "They were offering second-rate pictures with ridiculously high estimates. Business is still very good for something that is good. Scandinavian art is, quite frankly, a very small market. There are no real collectors of Scandinavian art outside of Scandinavia, where the whole economy is in appalling condition."
Polly Sartori, who heads 19th-century art sales at Christie's, said she had been disappointed by the auctions -- especially when the Geromes failed to sell: "I don't think the market for 19th-century European art will be volatile in the future. If very good pictures by very good artists are offered, they will do well and find homes."
The good news for the auction houses came in the jewelry sales. At Christie's sale on Tuesday, 298 of the 362 pieces of jewelry offered were sold for a total of $31 million, a record for such a sale at this house. The total was above the estimate of $23 million to $29 million. At Sotheby's, 143 of the 156 jewelry lots offered were sold for a total of $2 million in the first sesssion of a sale that was estimated to bring $1.4 million to $1.8 million.
 
Photos in the Forefront
 Sotheby's and Christie's in New York had their ups and downs last week as well. At the photography auctions held at both houses, high prices were paid for a few images in sales that otherwise did not do well for the auctioneers or consigners. The highest price realized was $126,500, paid at Christie's on Oct. 17 for Man Ray's 1920's Rayograph of a double brush, an image that looks like a ragged bowtie, suspended over a candle. The price, a record at auction for any photograph, was paid by a New York collector and dealer, Michael Senft of the One Bond gallery.
Other works did not command high prices at Christie's auction, in which only 497 of the 769 offerings were sold, for a total of $1.6 million. The house had expected the sale to bring $2.2 million to $3.6 million. Claudia Gropper, who heads photography sales at Christie's, said: "The main problem was there were far too many images presented to the market in a four-day period. It's a clear indication that we have to cut back."
At Sotheby's on Oct. 16, an Alfred Stieglitz portrait of Georgia O'Keeffe was sold for $99,000 to the SoHo dealer Min-Lowinsky Ltd. The price paid was a record for a photograph by Stieglitz. Sotheby's sale otherwise was a disappointment for the auction house. Of the 748 lots offered, only 465 were sold for a total of $2.3 million in a sale that was expected to bring $2.9 million to $4.3 million.
"They shouldn't have had such gigantic sales," said Timothy Baum, a New York photography dealer. "To have 700 and 800 lots is totally unnecessary when you have such a small audience. What good is volume if the percentage of what is sold is so disappointing?"
Beth Gates-Warren, who heads photography sales at Sotheby's, said: "It makes sense to approach the market selectively now. But this was the first sale in which this was the case. Our sales have doubled in size in three years. Until this sale, the material was easily absorbed into the market. I think in the future we have to be more selective, do smaller sales and concentrate on material that is fresh to the market."
 
Kennedy Jottings
 On Flag Day in 1947, John F. Kennedy addressed the Boston chapter of the Jewish War Veterans on "The Flag's Meaning in the Postwar World." His penciled draft of that speech, written on 15 yellow legal-pad pages, is one of the rare offerings in an auction of Americana manuscripts and printed material to be held at 2 P.M. on Tuesday at Sotheby's in New York. The presale estimate is $35,000 to $50,000.

HEADLINE: Staten Islanders Brace for Vote on Secession

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Waiting in line to drive onto the Staten Island ferry and go home, Gene Redondo drummed his fingers on his steering wheel and offered one indisputable fact about the island's referendum on secession that will take place Nov. 6. "Maybe it won't lead to secession," Mr. Redondo said, "but it will at least excite people to pay more attention to us."
The "us" Mr. Redondo referred to are the nearly 400,000 people of Staten Island who on Election Day will share a cathartic experience all too rare in political life -- a Declaration of Independence that the signers can retract if they later determine that they don't like the terms.
After decades of feeling neglected and exploited, New York City's most isolated borough will for the first time measure how most residents really feel about secession, a move that has been opposed by officials in the rest of the city as long as island residents have dreamed of it.
 
Long March to Freedom?
 But because Staten Island will be obliged to reconsider independence three years down the road, the true weight of marking "yes" on the ballot next month is largely in the eye of the voter.
To some, choosing "yes" would be the first step in a long march toward independence. For others who fear the economic consequences of secession, "yes" would provide a relatively safe means of expressing disdainfor the rest of the city -- a Staten Island version of a Bronx cheer.
Yesterday, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo told a group of Staten Island citizens, "It's very simple: you deserve the right to study and say whether or not you wish to secede." He explained that as Governor, he would not take a position on secession until a charter, approved by Staten Island, was presented to the State Legislature. "Should you?" he asked himself, "I don't know."
Mr. Cuomo, who was speaking at a forum on secession at Wagner College sponsored by The Staten Island Advance, also warned his audience that they should not assume that New York City would freely hand over city prop erty to a newly independent Staten Island. "The city will be furious with you if you secede," he said, "why should they make it easy for you? Why wouldn't they come down on you like an absolute ton of coal and say you can't have anything?"
Staten Island, which refers to itself as the forgotten borough as automatically as Indiana answers to the name the Hoosier State, has long simmered with discontent. Residents complain about problems like tolls, unreliable bus service and the presence of the Fresh Kills landfill, the world's largest outdoor garbage dump.
The island and the city seem to be forever at cross-purposes: City Hall recently enraged Staten Island by trying to block the Navy from building a port for warships there in the belief that some vessels would be nuclear-equipped; currently, Staten Island residents are outraged by the city's plan to build a new jail on the island.
The most popular refrain echoed throughout the island's mainly white, middle-class population, is "Why us?"
 
'Let's Dump the City'
 John McLaughlin, a 25-year-old trading floor reporter for the New York Stock Exchange, called it, "the dumping issue." He said caustically: "Whatever the city doesn't want gets dumped here. I say, let's dump the city."
If, as is widely expected, voters reply affirmatively to the question, "Shall a charter commission to provide for the separation of the Borough of Staten Island be created?" theirs would not necessarily be a binding cry for secession. Many consider the referendum as clearing the way for a serious examination of the merits of independence.
The 13-person commission would have three years to draft a new charter for the City of Staten Island. Three subcommittees would study the impact on finances, education and municipal employment. Even then, if Staten Island were to vote in favor of a new charter, independence would have to be approved by the State Legislature. New York City, moreover, maintains that any legislation putting secession into effect would first have to be approved by the City Council.
"The referendum will only raise false hopes among the people of Staten Island -- secession will not occur," Victor A. Kovner, the city's corporation counsel, said sternly, "That's why it is such an unfortunate misappropriation of public funds." The charter commission's work is expected to cost the state hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The secessionist movement on Staten Island gained noticeable momentum last year when the United States Supreme Court ruled that the city's form of government was unconstitutional because it gave Staten Island, the least populous borough, as much power on the Board of Estimate as Brooklyn, the most populous. Staten Island residents feared changes in the city's charter that would reduce their voice in municipal affairs.
"It's the same as the Revolution in 1776 -- taxation without representation," said Michael Biondo, a sanitation supervisor at the Fresh Kills landfill. Mr. Biondo, 55, who has lived on Staten Island for 25 years, said he thought his tax dollars were being sucked up by the city, instead of improving the quality of life in his borough. "Staten Island is putting a lot of money in the pot, and we're not getting anything back."
Maria Dawson, a 37-year-old hairdresser who works in a salon in the Staten Island Mall, echoed Mr. Biondo's sentiments, but proved less eager to gamble on independence. "Secession would be great, if all our problems could be solved -- but they never will be," she said, "I'll stay undecided until the economics of it are studied further."
 
Cost of Freedom Unclear
 There are no widely accepted assessments of what secession would cost Staten Island -- or the city and state.
Nor are there sure answers to questions about how services, like transportation, or police and firefighting protection, currently provided by the city, would be managed by an independent Staten Island. The charter commission would be responsible seeking some solutions, but the city would not be included in the process.
Some residents say they are sanguine about the cost of freedom. "I would be willing to pay more taxes," said Mr. Redondo, a director of facilities at New York University, "if it would prevent the overflow of city crime and homelessness from washing onto the island."
Even the most ardent secession advocates say they prefer to wait for the charter commission to outline realistic plans before leaping. "I don't even know if secession is a good idea," said Daniel Singletary, a Staten Island painter who created the Secession Party in 1989. "I'm just damn sure we should take a look at it."
Mr. Singletary has seceded from the Secessionist Party -- complaining that his grass-roots organization has been taken over by political candidates -- but he remains an advocate of the referendum. "We are saying that middle-class voters have a right to study the issue for themselves."
Mr. Singletary's assumption that Staten Island could have the final say in its destiny is bitterly disputed by opponents of the referendum. Brendan Sexton, a former city sanitation commissioner, who is now a professor at the Wagner Graduate School of New York University, called the Nov. 6 vote, "an exercise in wishful thinking" that would only lead to disappointment.
"The State Legislature will determine the terms of the separation, and I cannot believe they would be advantageous to Staten Island." he said. "It's like thinking that Flushing could secede and take Shea Stadium with them."
Mr, Biondo was not as cynical. "I look at this vote as a pressure-valve release," he said, "for once, and at last, Staten Island will have its say."

Tuning In on College Radio Bands at Clubs Around Town

BYLINE: By KAREN SCHOEMER

 BODY:
The college-radio industry is something like a small town: it's an insular, self-sufficient community with its own trends, rules, economy and morality. Within that community, there are different subgroups of musicians who find different ways of addressing what they feel is their particular audience. This weekend, the College Media Journal Music Marathon, an annual convention focusing on college-radio issues, brings dozens of college-radio bands to clubs throughout New York City. Some of them, like Redd Kross and Bob Mould, are favorites on the scene; others, like the Shams and Blackbird, are still at its fringes.
Redd Kross, a trio from Los Angeles, is perhaps the archetypal college-radio band of 1990. Originally formed as a punk band in 1978 when the McDonald brothers were 11 and 14 years old, Redd Kross now plays Monkees-style pop with a harder post-punk guitar edge. The group's third album and major-label debut, "Third Eye" (Atlantic), is stocked with in-jokes about pop culture that will appeal almost exclusively to people who grew up in the 1970's. 
 The three band members, the brothers Jeffrey and Steven McDonald on guitar and bass, and the guitarist Robert Hecker, have long, straight hair that comes straight from Marcia Brady of the television series "The Brady Bunch." They wear platform shoes, floppy hats and colorful shirts with designs that look like linoleum. The songs on the album are piled with references to 60's and 70's trash culture: "1976" describes "afros and apple pie/Camaro sports cars and gasoline lines," while "Zira (Call Out My Name)" is a love song directed to the heroine of the science-fiction film series "Planet of the Apes."
As silly as they seem, Redd Kross's incessant allusions are not the mindless retro posturing of current English groups like the Soup Dragons; rather, Redd Kross is attempting to make sense of its own cultural condition. To the band, the 70's represents a time of youthful innocence, when children were encouraged to watch "The Brady Bunch" instead of the Learning Channel. It was only in the 80's that such styles and entertainment were reinterpreted as "trash." The jokes and references on "Third Eye" are meant as a bond for those who still feel a connection with the passe, and to exclude those who don't share the experiences. Redd Kross never explains its jokes. "Zira (Call Out My Name)" will be understandable only to those who remember the names of the characters in "Planet of the Apes."
"We didn't want to say 'ape,' " said Jeffrey McDonald in a recent phone interview from Michigan. "We wanted it to seem like a regular love song, but the people that were cool enough would figure it out."
 
Three-Part Harmonies
 If Redd Kross's music is generation-dependent, then the songs of the Shams, a trio from New York City, are perhaps more sex-dependent. The Shams are a kind of post-modern Roches, minus the cabaret stylings; the group consists of three women who sing in delicate three-part harmonies (accompanied by guitar, bass and drums) about the peculiar problems facing the post-adolescent female. Although currently without a label, the Shams have released a single on S.O.L. (Singles Only Label), "3 A.M.," which contains the chorus, "It's only 3 A.M./The baby's waking up again/And I just want to smoke and drink and stay out late with men again."
Other Shams songs, like "File Clerk Blues" and "Texaco," their ode to a gas-station attendant, also combine description and delicate irony with mundane situations, giving them a vindication and realism not often heard in pop music. "I think a lot of people don't write about these things because they don't fit into the perfect fantasy of what a girl should be," the principal songwriter, Amy McMahon Rigby, said in a recent interview. "Either you're free and easy-living, or you're a boring, drab housewife, as though there's nothing in between. These things just aren't as easy for people to think about or hear about."
 
Personal Questions
 The singer and songwriter Bob Mould's second solo album, "Black Sheets of Rain" (Virgin), also touches on some difficult personal issues. Mr. Mould has earned a place in the college-radio pantheon based largely on his work with the Minneapolis punk trio Husker Du, which underwent a traumatic breakup following the release of its 1987 album "Warehouse." Much of Mr. Mould's first solo album, "Workbook," in 1989, was a musical reaction against his previous band, substituting acoustic guitars and cello for Husker Du's brusque, flat guitar noise. "Black Sheets of Rain" is something of a reaction against "Workbook," going back to Husker Du's forceful approach and fitting it into a more straight-ahead rock context.
The songs on "Black Sheets of Rain" use almost exclusively private metaphors. Each is a detailed account of a particular state of emotional turmoil bred by isolation. In "Hanging Tree," the narrator drives around alone trying to regain his balance after a relationship disintegrates; "Stand Guard" recounts a man's attempt to protect the few shreds of truth he has left in his life. In Mr. Mould's universe, the only audience that exists is the self. "Most of the songs are born from frustration," he said in a recent telephone interview from Massachusetts. "Some are just me trying to find out something that's wrong with my life, or somebody else's life that I see going on. The songs are always questions; some have better answers than others."
 
Guitar Noise and Pop Chords
 Like Mr. Mould's work, the albums by the Los Angeles duo Blackbird (the independent label Fundamental has just released a compilation of the two) are reactions to the band members' history. Made up of Chip Kinman on guitar and vocals, his brother Tony Kinman on bass, and a drum machine, Blackbird plays sub-rock -- an epic, enthralling tonic of guitar noise melded into broad pop chord progressions.
Although Blackbird has only existed since 1987, the Kinman brothers have been musically active since the late 70's. They began in a punk-rock band called the Dils, which released three singles before evolving into the country-rock band Rank and File. With its supple melodies and leathery twang, Rank and File's 1982 debut album, "Sundown," was a critical and cult success. But by 1987, record-company disputes, internal disagreements and creative lethargy had sapped the band; all the early promise had come to nothing, and the group broke up.
"We did the last Rank and File tour, and it was basically miserable," said Chip Kinman in a recent telephone interview from Los Angeles. "Tony and I had done van tours since 1977, and we thought to ourselves, 'Why are we playing every empty club in the United States?' We got back home and formed Blackbird. Musically, it was like, 'Let's do something decidedly alternative.' "
Blackbird caters to no particular audience: not the insular college-radio crowd, nor mainstream rock, nor even the underground noise scene. The albums have no titles and few graphics; the songs, which run into each other without a break, are structured on simple chord changes repeated with bulldozing power, over which Chip Kinman intones spare pop lyrics about love and desire. "We're way into minimalism," he said. "We're just trying to reconstruct and deconstruct pop music. We've learned a lot about the music industry the whole time. The things that new bands are told they can and can't do are just incredible. With Blackbird, we just decided to forget all that."
Redd Kross will perform tonight at the Ritz, 254 West 54th Street (956-3731). Show time is 9 P.M.; tickets are $14.50 to $15.50. The Shams will perform tomorrow night at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J. (201-798-4064). Tickets are $10; show time is 11 P.M.

HEADLINE: Bank of Boston Reports Large Loss

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
The Bank of Boston posted a loss today of $254.9 million for the third quarter, as it continues to experience declines because of the deteriorating Northeast economy and a weak real estate market.
For the corresponding quarter last year, the Bank of Boston's loss was $125.1 million. 
 The banking company last month predicted a heavy loss of at least $200 million in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30.
The company said it had set aside $200 million for bad loans in the third quarter, bringing its total loan-loss provision this year to $450 million. That compareswith a $370 million provision for 1989's third quarter and $442 million over all last year.
Bank officials said most of the bad loans were for real estate.
The Bank of Boston, New England's largest bank, had shown signs of recovery earlier this year. After posting huge losses last year, it turned a slight profit in the second quarter of this year, and officials said the volume of its bad loans decreased.
But last month, the bank cut its dividend to 10 cents a share, from 31 cents, as have other banks.
Bank of Boston slipped 25 cents yesterday, to $6.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Diner's Journal

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill

 BODY:

Can
 New York restaurateurs sound a little like politicians these days. They bridle at the word "depression," preferring instead to describe the dwindling number of guests in their dining rooms and the new abstemiousness of diners as a "restaurant recession." By any name, the change in the prevailing winds has stirred up wildly varied responses in the form of recently opened dining spots.
Can, which opened two weeks ago in SoHo, is a Spartan, tony place whose artful French-Vietnamese cooking (and steep prices) defies the current belt-tightening, back-to-basics trend. With its white-washed brick walls and contemplative jazz, the dining atrium looks more like a West Broadway art gallery than a restaurant. The art buyers and gallery owners who are beginning to trickle in to claim the 65 black lacquered chairs must feel right at home; certainly the food-serious do. Can's fare is cerebral, carefully crafted and, even for a non-aficionado of East-meets-West cooking, often very good.
At a recent lunch, the translucent rice dumplings were tender and tasty. Squid was perfectly sauteed on a mound of lettuces, fresh dill and opal basil, tossed with little taste-shocks of shredded ginger. The spring roll flanked a food sculpture of all its pure-tasting contents: carrots and bean threads, lettuce, shrimp and omelet. Unfortunately, the tuna-sushi pizza on a Jackson Pollock squiggle of yellow and red pepper puree was a flat-tasting, thick-crusted disk. Chicken, marinated in orange and raspberry vinaigrette, was nicely grilled. Smoked salmon was delicious, wrapped around a mousse of fresh salmon, crab meat and shrimp with a caviar sauce. Lunch, with coffee and dessert, was $140 for two. (Can, 482 West Broadway, at Houston Street, is open for lunch and dinner Tuesday through Sunday; 533-6333.)
 
Cafe Cassis
 In closer concert with the current no-frills mood, Cafe Cassis, a Provencal remake of the former Carolina, opened two weeks ago and offers a variety of lusty charcuterie as well as decent pizzas, roast chicken, fish stew and cod cakes at moderate prices (about $60 for two with wine, tax and tip) for pre- and post-theater dinners. (Cafe Cassis, 355 West 46th Street, is open for lunch and dinner Monday to Saturday; 245-0058.)
 
Vince & Eddie's
 Farther uptown, a similar back-to-basics mode reaches its apogee at Vince & Eddie's, a cozy neighborhood spot that opened last week. Mussels baked in garlicky herb butter and a lusty white-bean-and-ham soup recalled simpler times (and less-threatening prices: dinner for two is about $50, with wine, tax and tip).
The soggy crusted onion tart and misbegotten squid salad were forgiven, in fact forgotten, at the first bite of the main courses. Lamb shank, stewed with dried cherries; garlicky fried pork chops; pan-roasted chicken on a bed of cabbage and a waft of garlic and herbs could not have been better. (Vince & Eddie's, 70 West 68th Street, is open for lunch and dinner daily; 721-0068.)

HEADLINE: Home Resales Decline 8%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes in September fell 8 percent, to their lowest level in nearly three years, a real estate trade group said today. It attributed the decline to faltering consumer confidence in the economy.
"Consumers don't know what to expect," said Norman D. Flynn, president of the National Association of Realtors. "When people don't know what's coming, they tend to delay big-ticket expenditures."
The realtors said house resales totaled a seasonally adjusted 3.22 million, slowest since a 3.2 million rate in January 1988. The August rate had been 3.5 million. All regions posted sales declines except for the Northeast, which was unchanged.
The median price of an existing home nationally fell 2.9 percent in September, to $94,300. The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
Fixed-rate 30-year mortgages averaged 10.19 percent to 10.22 percent in September, generally higher than in the first half of the year.
Sales fell 10 percent in the South in September, to an annual rate of 1.26 million units. The median price of a home in the South was $85,900, down 1.2 percent from August.
The West posted a resale rate of 520,000 units, down 8.8 percent. The median home price was $134,700, a 3.9 percent decline from August.
Sales in the Midwest were off 7.1 percent, to 920,000 units. The median price was $74,000, a 1.7 percent drop.
Sales in the Northeast remained unchanged at 520,000 units, despite a 5.6 percent drop in the median price to $137,100.

HEADLINE: Drexel Deal Is Described By Witness

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
A former salesman of high-yield "junk bonds" with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. testified yesterday that Michael R. Milken once told him that securities owned by the firm were sometimes secretly held by the Columbia Savings and Loan Association, one of Drexel's largest clients.
The testimony by the salesman, James Dahl, came in the pre-sentencing hearing for Mr. Milken and was the first public evidence that Columbia may have "parked" securities for Drexel. 
 According to the testimony, Columbia held securities for Drexel's "undisclosed economic benefit" shortly after the arrest of Dennis B. Levine, a former investment banker with Drexel, on insider trading charges.
 
No Other Transactions
 But Mr. Dahl, who represented many of the large savings and loans that worked with Drexel, said he did no similar transactions with any other institutions.
Columbia is now struggling to avoid being seized by the Government as part of the savings bailout. Thomas Spiegel, a close friend of Mr. Milken's, resigned last year as chairman of the California savings institution.
Mr. Dahl also provided vivid testimony about a meeting he had with Mr. Milken after the announcement that Ivan F. Boesky, the former arbitrager, had agreed to settle insider trading charges and cooperate with the Government in its investigation of Wall Street abuses. At the meeting, held in a Drexel bathroom, Mr. Milken told Mr. Dahl, cryptically, "Do whatever you need to do."
The testimony came as the Government presented evidence in the last of three transactions it says were part of a pattern of securities violations by Mr. Milken. In this last transaction, the Government contends that Mr. Milken used inside information in the purchase of bonds in Caesars World Inc., which was readying a debt-for-equity exchange at the time of the purchase with Drexel as the underwriter.
Although a series of possible crimes were described yesterday, the testimony was the murkiest about the Government's allegation of insider trading in the Caesars World bonds. Mr. Dahl testified that although Mr. Milken told him to purchase the bonds, he could not say when that directive was given. Further, the trades by Mr. Dahl that were the focus of testimony yesterday took place several days after Mr. Milken left the country for a vacation.
Also, under cross-examiniation, Mr. Dahl said that he had done the Caesars World trade as part of a debt-swap with clients who needed cash to purchase two new issues of junk bonds. Mr. Dahl said he had not remembered that the purchase of the Caesars bonds were part of a debt-swap until he saw all the trading tickets from the transaction yesterday.
 
Contradictions in Testimony
 In addition, the two Government witnesses who testified on the transaction contradicted each other on key elements, such as whether Mr. Dahl told clients there was a market rumor that Caesars World would do a debt-for-equity swap.
Testimony on other issues, however, were damaging to Mr. Milken and included a number of apparent references to illicit activities similar to those he has already admitted.
Prescott Crocker, a portfolio manager with Colonial Group Inc., testified that Mr. Milken had offered to do a series of compensatory trades after Mr. Crocker complained that he believed Drexel had used inside information in its purchase of Caesars bonds from him. Mr. Crocker said that he did not do the compensatory trading because it "is an irregular practice and it is perhaps illegal."
 
Called on Sunday
 In his testimony, Mr. Dahl said he was called at home on a Sunday by Mr. Milken, who summoned him to Drexel's office in Beverly Hills, Calif. Mr. Dahl testified that after arriving, he sat across from Mr. Milken for several hours waiting to speak to him.
The former salesman said that when he indicated that he wanted to leave, Mr. Milken took him to the men's room and began running water at a sink. Leaning closely to the sink, Mr. Milken was said to have then told Mr. Dahl in hushed tones: "There haven't been any subpoenas issued, so whatever you need to do, do it."
Under cross-examination, Mr. Dahl said that he did not think Mr. Milken was asking him to destroy documents or not to cooperate with the Government's inquiry.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 1, 1990, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transmission error, an article in Business Day on Friday about the pre-sentence hearing of Michael R. Milken misstated the period during which an illegal securities trading scheme was said to have taken place between Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the Columbia Savings and Loan Association. A witness said it began before 1983 and ended shortly after the 1986 arrest of Dennis B. Levine, a former Drexel investment banker, on charges of insider trading.

HEADLINE: Laventhol & Horwath Seeks 10% Pay Cut

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Laventhol & Horwath, the nation's seventh-largest accounting firm with $345 million in revenues last year, told its nearly 3,500 employees yesterday that they would have to take a 10 percent pay cut for three months because the firm is under financial pressure.
The cuts come when several mid-sized firms are struggling under unusual competitive pressures. Spicer & Oppenheim, a New York firm with $75 million in revenues last year, is said to be reeling. 
 "My understanding is that the firm is breaking up and partners are seeking new alliances," said a partner of a competitor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said he had been been interviewing Spicer partners looking to leave the firm. The partner added that Spicer, the nation's 17th-largest, would probably last no more than three weeks.
Although Laventhol blamed the deteriorating economy for its salary request, it is well known that the Philadelphia-based firm has seen its profits hurt in recent months by adverse judgments or settlements in various lawsuits contending that the firm had performed poor audits, only some of which were covered by insurance.
Earlier this week, for instance, a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Laventhol and Deloitte & Touche over their role as the former auditors of the PTL ministry, which was founded by Jim Bakker and later collapsed, went to trial in Charlotte, N.C. Some people in the profession say that an adverse judgment in the case could cause Laventhol to shut down.
"What Laventhol & Horwath has instituted is simply a sound and prudent business policy," the firm explained in a statement yesterday. "The softening economy may affect our projected future revenues, and we, like hundreds of other firms, are making adjustments to preserve the financial integrity and underlying strengths of the firm.
"Our policy is to avoid terminations whenever possible, and we think this 2.5 percent of annual income taken out over a three-month period is a much better solution than across the board job cuts," the statement said.
Because the 2.5 percent cut in annual pay is being withheld in the next three months, employees will see their net pay drop by 10 percent, starting immediately.
 
Firm Is 'Optimistic'
 Louis J. Grossman, a spokesman for the firm, said Laventhol was optimistic that improved conditions would allow the firm to restore pay levels by February. He declined to say whether the firm's partners were experiencing any decline in their take-home pay.
At Spicer, the chairman, Stephen Oppenheim, denied yesterday that his firm was about to break up, but he and two other members of the firm's senior management were said yesterday by several senior partners of other accounting firms to be talking seriously about joining a Los Angeles firm, Kenneth Leventhal & Company, in anticipation of Spicer's imminent breakup.
Spicer, with headquarters at 7 World Trade Center, where it occupies nearly three floors and employs about 500 people, is late in paying its rent, but its partners have guaranteed the obligation, bankers and real estate executives confirmed yesterday.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
Lawmakers Take Stock Of Winners and Losers

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
As their leaders put finishing touches on the deficit-reduction compromise, rank- and-file members of Congress today began toting up the winners and losers in the five-month struggle to make the deal.
Although House Democrats loyally praised their top leadership -- the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, and the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt -- many thought the clearest Democratic hero was Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who heads the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 A year ago, Mr. Rostenkowski faced open rebellion on the panel and suffered a humiliating defeat on the House floor over the question of cutting the capital gains tax rate.
This year, as chief architect of a tax-the-rich plan for deficit reduction, he was a leader in helping the Democrats reassert themselves as protectors of middle-class economic interests. Not surprisingly, the most effusive praise for the Ways and Means chairman came from members of his own panel, particularly liberals who shared the embarrassment of last year's capital gains debacle.
 
Praise for Rostenkowski
 "It was Rosty's plan and Rosty's strategy to focus on fairness," said Representative Marty Russo, an Illinois Democrat. "We've shown the difference between our party and the Republicans, and we're finally beginning to change what's been happening over the past 10 years."
Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Long Island Democrat and another Rostenkowski protege on the committee, put it more broadly: "After years of trying and failing, we have shifted the debate from whether to tax to who to tax. The bottom line is that a Democratic candidate can now be a Democratic candidate in the true sense of the term."
Among Democrats, Mr. Gephardt, of Missouri, also fared pretty well. As chairman of the Congressional team that negotiated the budget package with the White House, he passed his first real test of leadership, demonstrating that he could keep the process moving, hold the warring factions together and bring the deal to a close on terms satisfactory to most of the party.
That has clearly raised his stock among Democratic colleagues who feared he would never leave the campaign trail, but it is not yet clear whether the institutional victory translates into brighter Presidential prospects down the road.
 
G.O.P. View on Gephardt
 "In the extreme short run, Gephardt's stature is enhanced," one Republican strategist said a little grumpily. "But if the recession is deep and people blame the Democrats for raising taxes, by 1992 he may be damaged goods."
In the eyes of some Democrats, Mr. Foley, of Washington, was mildly tarred by his association with the failed budget summit. While liberals give him grudging credit for doing what he had to do to make a deal with the White House and the more conservative Senate, they remain uneasy with his conciliatory approach and suspicious that he would have settled for less in the final deal if those with more partisan instincts had not weighed in.
"There is no question that the leadership is hurt by its commitment to the summit," said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat. "I think next time they try to tell us about doomsday scenarios, they won't be able to convince us so easily. They lost credibility on that and on stragegy."
The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, a Democrat of Maine, whose aloof public manner irritated many House Democrats during the months of budget negotiating, nonetheless got high marks from his party colleagues for being a tough partisan behind closed doors.
 
Dole, the Deal Maker
 On the Republican side, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, stands out as Mr. Rostenkowski's counterpart as a consummate deal maker. But his hopes for cutting into the Democratic majority are slim in 1990 and perhaps for 1992 as well.
"The Democrats have had the advantage so far, but if we can make the case that they are raising taxes and not cutting spending, it will be to our advantage in the long run," said Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
In regard to political reputations, the major development on the Republican side came in the final, bitter weeks of budget negotiating. The White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and the budget director, Richard G. Darman, settled firmly into their roles as the pair that everybody on Capitol Hill loves to hate. Much of the animosity has less to do with politics than with personalities that lawmakers find arrogant and abrasive.
Privately, some Republicans now say that the President's men were only doing his bidding. "You can quibble with the execution here and there, but I don't think the President's agents ought to be held accountable for carrying out the President's instructions," said one House Republican strategist.
 
Bush as Possible Winner
 Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who was part of the original budget negotiations, but who now says he has not made up his mind about whether to support the final package, said even the President might eventually come out a winner. "In the short run, the Democrats have benefited, but in the long run, the President has put behind him the only real threat to his Presidency -- a huge and growing budget deficit," he said.
Conservative House Republicans, who torpedoed the initial budget compromise that would have given their President more of what he wanted, were less convinced and less forgiving.
"Our people are distancing themselves from Medicare cuts and tax increases," said Representative Vin Weber, a Minnesota Republican.
He added: "Everybody loves George Bush, but unfortunately George Bush has been identified with those policies. Two weeks before the election, you don't want to be associated with unpopular policies."
For Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip and the leader of the rebellion, the reviews of his colleagues are mixed. In the corridors of the Captol today, some Republicans talked of the "Gingrich tax," convinced that his disloyalty cost the President crucial leverage that could have produced a better deal.
On the other hand, Mr. Gingrich has earned the kind of national name identity that is beyond the fondest dreams of most House members. Some House Republicans who already feel themselves irrelevant to the legislative and political process say the gamble may have been worth it.

HEADLINE: Some Tax Analysts Doubt Rich Would Be Hard Hit

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
A number of independent tax specialists who have reviewed the budget package negotiated by Congressional Democrats and the Bush Administration said today that the "soak the rich" rhetoric accompanying it was largely a misrepresentation.
These experts did not dispute figures, provided by Congressional tax specialists on Wednesday, showing that the package would raise the level of all Federal taxes on those earning $200,000 or more annually by an average of 6.4 percent, a larger increase than for the average of any income group below them. 
 But the experts said that only those whose earnings run substantially into six figures would be likely to suffer a major blow and that the complexity that the plan would add to individual returns meant so many fluctuations that even among this group, some people would actually receive a tax cut.
They also stressed an element of the plan that has not been nearly so widely publicized as the taxes on the rich: that most middle-income people would pay more than they do now.
 
No Dearth of Variables
 The tax practitioners cautioned that the new package, whose final touches were still being applied today, would affect taxpayers in a variety of ways, so that whether a couple paid more or less would depend not only on the amount of income received but also on such factors as family size, the source and division of income, and whether one is salaried or self-employed.
But rough calculations performed today by the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company showed that for two hypothetical families, neither an extreme case, the effects of the new package were not as advertised by many of its advocates.
A two-earner, childless couple with adjusted gross income of $184,200 and $20,000 of itemized deductions, for example, would find their Federal income tax levy falling by $1,136 and their Medicare taxes rising by $1,183, a net tax increase of only $47.
A one-earner couple with two children, earning $83,400 and claiming deductions of $8,300 would see no change in their income tax but would see their Medicare levy rise by $465, according to the calculations, which were performed by Marc D. Levy, a member of the accounting fir's Washington office of Federal tax services.
 
'That's Where It Is'
 The talk about the Treasury's obtaining big revenue from the rich "is all garbage," asserted Norman Ture, a Reagan Administration official who now heads the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation. "You've got to get it out of the middle-income people, because that's where it is."
Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-oriented group, said that by its calculations, a family of four with gross income of $300,000 could, through heavy deductions, wind up with a tax cut of $5,000. The reason is that the deductions could push such a family's taxable income down to a level that now falls within "the bubble" -- the portion of income, roughly $80,000 to $200,000, that is currently taxed at 33 percent. Under the new plan, the top tax rate would be 31 percent (a two-point drop for such a family) and the ceiling on the capital gains tax would be 28 percent (a five-point drop).
Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, said the plan would cut the taxes of "well-off doctors, lawyers and executives" -- and those of Congressional and Administration negotiators as well.
 
One Firm's Calculations
 The calculations by Arthur Andersen assume 4 percent inflation and place at $81,550 the level at which the 28 percent income tax rate would end and the new maximum rate of 31 percent would begin. They ignore capital gains, whose rate preference, eliminated by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, would be restored in a small way by capping the tax on gains at 28 percent. But the calculations do take account of the plan's other major tax provisions: limits on the value of itemized deductions and the phasing out of the value of personal exemptions.
The family with $184,200 in income would lose the value of $1,026 in itemized deductions -- 3 percent of the amount exceeding $150,000. (The cut-off for single filers would apparently be $100,000.) This family would also lose $115 from personal exemptions, now $2,050 each, which would be worth progressively less for joint filers with incomes between $150,000 and $275,000. But, being within the bubble, where income is now taxed at 33 percent, this couple would benefit from the new top rate of 31 percent.
Over all, including their Medicare increase, their tax levy would rise only slightly, though it would increase somewhat more if the couple were self-employed or one partner earned far more than the other.
The $83,400 family -- which is assumed to have $8,300 in itemized deductions, about the same percentage of income as the wealthier family -- does not earn enough to be affected by the deduction limits or by the changes in personal exemptions or tax rates. But it would pay $465 more over all than at present because the 1.45 percent Medicare tax would be levied on its entire income instead of only the first $51,300. The new plan's maximum base for the Medicare tax is said to be $125,000.
There are other anomalies as well in the plan. While the top income tax rate would nominally be 31 percent, some people might find themselves paying a somewhat higher rate on their last dollars earned.
For example, the limitation on exemptions for high-income families means that for each child or other dependent, the marginal rate would in effect be raised by half a percentage point. As a result, a family of 10 could find itself paying 36 percent of its final earnings in taxes. It was not clear tonight whether there would be any limit on how much a high-income couple might be disadvantaged by having a large family.
Further, the limitations on itemized deductions would raise the statutory 31 percent maximum rate to an effective 31.93 percent and the new 28 percent capital gains rate to 28.84 percent, according to Randall Weiss, director of tax economics at Deloitte & Touche and a former top aide to the Joint Tax Committee of Congress.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
U.S. DECIDES TO ADD AS MANY AS 100,000 TO ITS GULF FORCES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has decided to expand the number of American forces in the Persian Gulf and may send as many as 100,000 more troops to the region, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today.
The United States has sent more than 210,000 troops to the gulf, as part of a planned deployment of 240,000 troops. In announcing that more forces would be sent, Mr. Cheney said the exact number had not been worked out, and he gave no date for completing the American military buildup in the region, the largest since the Vietnam War. 
 Mr. Cheney said some of the additional forces might be drawn from among the 50,000 American troops that are being withdrawn from Western Europe.
 
Seeking to Increase Pressure
 Officially, the Administration maintained that the move did not signal a policy change. But by announcing that it was sending more combat forces and that the complement might be substantial, the Pentagon seemed to be trying to increase pressure on President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and accept a peaceful settlement on United Nations and American terms.
The additional deployment of large numbers of troops would transform the American ground force in Saudi Arabia from a largely defensive military formation to one better suited for offensive action. Some military planners, including Army officials, have been saying for weeks that the United States should deploy two additional heavy divisions if it wanted to open an attack to evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait, which Iraq invaded on Aug. 2.
 
Little Boycott Effect Seen
 The decision to send more troops came as William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, said the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations have had little effect on the Iraqi military. Answering questions after a speech in Washington this morning, Mr. Webster said he had "no real confidence" that stability could be achieved in the Middle East if Mr. Hussein remained in power -- unless Iraq disarms or is constrained by a regional military alliance.
Taking note of the large number of Iraqi troops in Kuwait, Mr. Webster said that President Hussein's strategy "is to sit tight if he can unless he is threatened with imminent peril."
Mr. Cheney, who met with President Bush on Wednesday, disclosed the decision to send more combat troops in a series of morning interviews with four television networks, and his spokesman reaffirmed the decision at the regular Pentagon briefing for reporters.
Mr. Cheney said the United States had never set an "upper ceiling" on the number of troops that would be sent, and he added that the Pentagon had not formally decided precisely which additional units to send.
Asked on the CBS News program "This Morning" whether the Administration might send 100,000 more troops to the Persian Gulf, Mr. Cheney said, "It's conceivable that we'll end up with that big an increase."
Pete Williams, the chief Pentagon spokesman, reaffirmed that statement at the Pentagon's regular news briefing for reporters today, saying a deployment of that magnitude was possible.
The units to be sent will be selected after Mr. Cheney confers with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who met with military commanders in Saudi Arabia this week. Officials said additional units would augment the troop total in the region, and would not end up simply substituting for American forces recalled home as part of a troop rotation.
 
Original Ceiling of 240,000
 The Pentagon's original plan, decided on in August, called for sending about 240,000 troops, a force that include four and a half Army divisions and 45,000 marines, some 11,000 of whom are on ships for a possible amphibious landing.
That deployment is nearing completion, and the Pentagon has said that more than 210,000 American troops are already in the region, including Navy and Air Force personnel.
The last Army combat unit that was previously scheduled for deployment, the last elements of the First Cavalry Division, arrived in Saudi Arabia this week, and only support troops and logistical items remained to be sent until today's announcement.
The original Pentagon plan to send about 240,000 troops was based on earlier contingency planning by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of all American forces in the region, for defending Saudi Arabia against a possible Iraqi invasion.
 
Attack Plan Was Missing
 General Schwarzkopf's contingency plans were not complete when Iraq invaded Kuwait, said a military official who asked not to be identified. He said one missing element was a plan for an American counterattack against Iraqi forces.
Iraq has had about 430,000 troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq for more than a month. Administration officials have said the Iraqis have been strengthening their position by laying mines, building sand barrers and digging in their tanks, a development that Mr. Cheney suggested has encouraged the Pentagon to send more troops.
Explaining why the Administration was continuing the buildup, Mr. Cheney said the United States needed to have enough forces in the gulf "to deal with any contingency."
Reiterating Administration policy, the Defense Secretary said that American forces were sent to Saudi Arabia to deter Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia, to prepare to defend the Saudi kingdom in the event of an attack and to enforce the United Nations sanctions against Iraq.
 
Seeking 'Range of Options'
 But he added that the deployment of American forces was also intended "to give the President a range of other options should another option be necessary," an apparent reference to possible offensive American action to drive the Iraqi forces out of Kuwait.
"The fact is that Saddam Hussein has continued his buildup in Kuwait," Mr. Cheney said on the CBS program.
"He's dug in in a very permanent-looking sort of way, gives no indication of being willing to withdraw from Kuwait," he added. "And we think that it's necessary to make certain that we've got the forces over there to deal with any contingency."
There are a number of ways to build up the American force in the region. Mr. Cheney suggested that the Pentagon would replace the lightly equipped 82d Airborne, which was deployed early in the operation, with a heavier mechanized division, a move long advocated by military planners.
Both Mr. Cheney and his spokesman said the United States might send some of the 50,000 troops to be withdrawn from Europe this year to Saudi Arabia. This announcement surprised some Army officials, according to Pentagon officials.
 
Europe Units Called Unready
 The officials said the Army units being withdrawn had already stopped some combat training, were not at full strength, and might not be the best suited to build up American military power in Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Cheney's disclosures also surprised some members of Congress. The Defense Secretary had only hinted at the moves at a closed-door meeting with House members on Wednesday, saying the Administration had set no upper limits on American forces.
Administration officials said that Washington was still committed to using economic sanctions to try to compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, and that the decision to send additional forces did not mean that the Administration had decided on military action.
Mr. Webster said economic sanctions against Iraq were having little visible effect on President Hussein's military and probably would not for some time.
 
Iraqi Stockpiling Described
 "The sanctions are beginning to have an effect in a number of areas, but very few of them are in the military," Mr. Webster said, "He knows the value of stockpiling, and has done so."
The steps taken by the Iraqi military, like retreading truck tires, may be efforts to avoid shortages and not a reaction to them, he said.
Intelligence data suggest that some of Mr. Hussein's military advisers may be starting to chafe under his leadership, he said, but Mr. Webster held out little hope for either a revolution or a high-level coup in Baghdad.
"We had all that in place in Panama," he said, "but it took something else." He referred to the American invasion to remove Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power in December.
 
Deployment Compared
 Pentagon officials have repeatedly described the dispatch of more than 210,000 American soldiers, marines, airmen and sailors in the gulf as the speediest military deployment in history. In the Vietnam conflict, the United States had dispatched 23,000 advisers by 1964; by the end of 1965, it had 184,300 troops in Vietnam, excluding sailors in the South China Sea. By the end of 1966, the total had risen to 385,000.
In addition to the American forces, close to 200,000 troops from Saudi Arabia, Britain, France, Egypt and other nations allied with the United States are also in the Persian Gulf. Arrangements have been made in recent days to transport a Syrian armored division to Saudi Arabia.
Iraq has steadily expanded its forces in Kuwait and southern Iraq, reaching a level of about 430,000 troops more than a month ago.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
Experts Expect Stimulus to Economic Morale but Little Else

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The budget agreement now before Congress might make the hard times engulfing the American economy slightly harder next year, economists say. But the damage will probably be too small to measure.
What many experts hope is that the budget agreement will have a psychological impact far beyond the economics involved. Should confidence be restored in the Government's ability to control the budget deficit, this in itself might stimulate the economy, some economists argue. The stimulation would come in part because lenders, being more optimistic about the economy's health, would demand lower interest rates. 
 "The biggest problem with the budget deficit is that we have lost public confidence and trust," said Representative Lee Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. "This five-year agreement should restore that trust; it is a genuine, creditable attack on the deficit problem."
 
 Hoping for Action
 In the view of Mr. Hamilton, other politicians and economists, the Federal Reserve should regard the agreement as credible and behave accordingly, pushing down interest rates. That would more than offset any negative effect of the budget agreement.
Lower rates encourage people to borrow for consumer spending and investment, canceling out the Government's reduced role as a source of spending and economic stimulus.
Federal Reserve officials declined to say whether they considered the latest budget agreement acceptable. "We have no comment," said Joseph Coyne, a spokesman for Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Greenspan has suggested in the past that a "credible" deficit reduction package -- one that reduces the Government's borrowing requirements -- would automatically ease the pressure on interest rates and thus permit the Federal Reserve to hasten the process by using its power to manipulate rates.
 
 The Arithmetic of Rates
 Many economists say that to reverse the economy's slide toward recession, the Federal Reserve would have to be more decisive in reducing interest rates than it has been over the past year, as the economy weakened. Specifically, the Federal Reserve would have to shave at least one percentage point off the charges now imposed on many loans. Consumers, for example, pay 10 percent or more today for most auto loans, home mortgages and other financing.
"Most people feel that the contractionary impact of the budget agreement, if there is to be any, will come in the first year," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office. "The reason is that the Fed will have less leeway to push down rates and more room to adjust its policies in the ensuing years."
If Mr. Reischauer is correct, then any recessionary impact of the budget package would be greatly reduced in 1992, a Presidential election year.
So far this year, the Federal Reserve has shown more concern about controlling inflation than avoiding recession. Although the economy was weakening when the Middle East crisis began in August, Fed officials said they would hold rates unchanged because they considered the inflationary potential from the crisis a greater immediate problem than any recessionary impact.
The central bank fights inflation by raising interest rates or keeping them high, which discourages the borrowing that finances spending and puts pressure on prices.
 
 Concerns About Weakness
 If the Federal Reserve does not act, some economists and politicians worry that an economy already close to recession would be further weakened as the Government reduces its role in an effort to cut the budget deficit.
But the new proposals to lower spending and raise taxes would reduce the deficit by only $35 billion over the next 12 months. That is a minuscule amount in an economy that will generate $5.4 trillion in new wealth this year.
The budget deficit in the 1990 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, was about $220 billion, or roughly 4 percent of the $5.4 trillion gross national product. And the budget deficit at the end of fiscal 1991, even if Congress and President Bush approve the new package, would be $250 billion to $260 billion -- still 4 percent of the G.N.P.
Budget deficits as a percent of the total economy often rise during economic downturns and then shrink as the economy recovers and once again produces growing quantities of wealth and tax revenue to pay for Government spending. The 1981-82 recession, for example, pushed the deficit to 6.3 percent of G.N.P. in 1983. The deficit then slowly declined to 3 percent in the late 1980's before rising again as the economy weakened in 1989 and tax revenue began to fall.
 
 Reducing Government's Role
 The budget agreement might change this pattern over a five-year period by steadily reducing the Government's role in the economy through $500 billion in spending cuts and tax increases. The shrinkage might indeed reduce the budget deficit to 2 percent or less of G.N.P., the levels that prevailed until the early 1970's -- unless the cure removes so much stimulation from the economy that recession develops.
Mr. Reischauer and many other economists are counting on the private sector to prevent this from happening. As they argue, a lower budget deficit means the Government can cut back on its borrowing to finance the deficit. The reduced borrowing, in turn, frees national savings for use by the private sector, which then borrows the money, at relatively low interest rates, for investment and spending.
That is the theory that Congress, the Administration and many economists often invoke to help justify proposals that would sharply reduce the budget deficit. But the problem is that the Federal Government has operated in deficit almost every year since World War II, and during this period, interest rates, investment and savings have often failed to behave according to theory, economists note. As the deficit rose in the mid-1980's, for example, interest rates fell and investment by the private sector rose, although the Government was commandeering ever larger portions of the nation's savings.
The connections might break down again, economists say, for several reasons. One is that the savings and loan bailout accounts for 30 percent of the deficits in 1990 and 1991. Many economists argue that the bailout has an essentially neutral effect. The Government, according to this view, is borrowing from the savings of some Americans to replenish the savings of others, who had kept their money in savings institutions that failed.
 
 'A Stabilizer'
 "You would think that a deficit that has pushed above $200 billion would have a dramatic impact on the economy," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities. "But mostly the deficit is acting as a stabilizer, offsetting the shrinkage in national savings that would have occurred without the thrift bailout."
The tax proposals in the budget agreement also ameliorate the impact on the economy by putting a big portion of the new tax burden on people with high incomes. Some economists say that when a wealthy person pays slightly higher taxes, the impact on his income is too small to inhibit spending.
"To the extent that the tax pain is spread across income groups, the negative impact on the economy should be fairly limited," Mr. Yardeni said.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
ELDERLY SHIELDED FROM BIG INCREASE IN MEDICARE COSTS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
House and Senate budget negotiators said today they had agreed on how to shield the elderly from any large increase in Medicare costs, one of the last outstanding issues in the deficit-reduction package Congress and the White House have been laboring on for nearly two months.
The agreement involves only a modest increase in Medicare costs for the elderly but substantial cuts in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals. 
 The negotiators also agreed on a significant expansion of Medicaid to cover all poor children through the age of 18 by the year 2001. Many governors have opposed Federal requirements for Medicaid expansion, fearing they would saddle the states with enormous new costs, but Congress concluded that poor children are entitled to health insurance coverage even in a time of austerity.
 
Compromise Nears Completion
 The agreements on Medicare and Medicaid came as Congressional leaders neared completion of a compromise tax-and-spending package in preparation for votes Friday on the largest deficit-reduction plan in history. [Page A20.]
At the White House, Marlin Fitzwater, the press secretary, said President Bush was satisfied with the overall measure, which is supposed to cut the deficit by $40 billion this year and $500 billion over five years. But a senior Administration official attacked the Democrats, asserting they had forced the President to raise taxes. And the White House objected unsuccessfully to "the mandatory expansion of Medicaid" to cover additional poor children.
The relatively favorable terms toward beneficiaries, particularly the elderly, in the agreements on Medicare and Medicaid were essential to win political support among Democrats, the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, said.
 
Higher Payroll Taxes
 Over all, the changes in the Medicare program would save roughly $43 billion over five years, substantially less than the $60 billion target in the budget summit agreement negotiated by White House officials and Congressional leaders at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. But much of the extra cost would be offset by new revenues, resulting from a dramatic increase in the amount of earnings subject to the Medicare payroll tax.
Mr. Foley said the agreement would include provisions of the House-passed budget bill intended to "reduce the burden on Medicare beneficiaries." The summit agreement and a budget bill passed last week by the Senate would have required the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries to share more of the program's costs. Democrats, who often campaign as protectors of the elderly, demanded a reduction in that burden as a condition for supporting the deficit-reduction plan.
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a lobby for the elderly, said, "The compromise on Medicare is beginning to look much more like the House package than the Senate package, and that is good news for Medicare beneficiaries of moderate income."
Under the tentative agreement, the monthly Medicare premium for insurance covering doctors' bills, now $28.60, would rise gradually over five years to $46.20, as provided in the House bill. The $75 Medicare deductible, which is paid once a year by users of physician services, would rise to $100 in 1991 and would stay at that level in later years. The summit plan called for further increases in the deductible, to $125 in 1992 and $150 in 1993.
 
Doctors to Get Less
 While the elderly would pay less than envisioned in the summit plan, doctors and hospitals would pay more. The new agreement would save $32 billion to $33 billion over five years by paring Medicare payments to such health-care providers, as against $30 billion envisioned in the budget summit accord.
Lawmakers and lobbyists are still fighting over details of payments to doctors and hospitals. But they said it was clear that the final bill would trim reimbursements to them in myriad ways: reducing the inflation adjustment in hospital payments, reducing the allowance for the cost of hospital equipment and construction, cutting payments to doctors for "overpriced procedures" and freezing payments for physician services other than primary care.
Authoritative studies done for the Government concluded that Medicare payments for primary care, such as routine office visits, were inexplicably low when compared with national norms for all physician services.
As an example of the payment cuts to doctors under the compromise emerging from Congress, reimbursements to radiologists would be cut 6 percent to 7 percent below the amounts they would otherwise receive for treating Medicare patients in the current fiscal year.
 
Power of the Elderly
 Gary W. Price, director of government relations at the American College of Radiology, said, "When members of Congress decided it was impossible to raise Medicare beneficiary premiums much, they looked to health-care providers for additional savings."
"Our group, with slightly more than 20,000 members, and other health-care providers do not have nearly as much influence as a group like the American Association of Retired Persons, with more than 30 million members," Mr. Price said.
House and Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed to mandate Medicaid coverage of poor children through age 18. Current law requires coverage of poor children through age 5. Starting in 1991, state Medicaid programs would have to cover poor children 8 years old and under. The pool of eligible youngsters would expand gradually over the next decade until it includes all poor children through age 18.
 
An Extraordinary Coalition
 Federal and state governments share Medicaid costs, with states paying an average of 44 percent of the total. The National Governors Association has argued against mandatory expansion of Medicaid. But an extraordinary coalition of doctors, hospitals, insurers, business groups and children's advocates lobbied for it.
"This is exciting, more than we could have hoped for, and we are very pleased," said Kay Johnson, director of health issues at the Children's Defense Fund, a private group that lobbies for assistance to children.
The House-Senate compromise on Medicaid would also permit states to cover children through the age of 5 in families that are not poor but have incomes no more than 85 percent above the official poverty level. That would permit coverage of a family of three with income up to $18,287 this year. (A family of three earning less than $9,885 in 1989 was classified as living in poverty.)
 
Fast-Growing Program
 Even with the proposed cutbacks, Medicare would remain one of the fastest-growing programs in the Federal budget for several reasons: The elderly population is growing, health care costs are rising faster than the Consumer Price Index and the volume of physician services is growing even as the Government controls prices by limiting Medicare fees to doctors.
The new budget agreement continues the trend of the last eight years toward mind-boggling complexity in the formulas used to calculate Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals. House and Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed to reduce the inflation adjustment in payments to hospitals for in-patient care by 2 percentage points this year, 1.5 points next year and 1.4 points in 1993. At the same time, they would pay hospitals only 95 percent of the recognized costs of out-patient services.
A volatile political issue, still unresolved, is how to compensate inner-city hospitals and isolated rural hospitals that have exceptionally high costs. House negotiators are fighting for $2.5 billion in extra Medicare payments to urban hospitals, while Senate negotiators want to distribute $1.4 billion to rural hospitals.
Members of Congress said they had made progress in settling disagreements between the House and the Senate over a proposd child-care program, which would provide $2.5 billion in Federal grants to the states over three years. Negotiators have agreed on who will be eligible for the program, meant to help low-income families. But they have yet to work out such details as how to expand the Federal income tax credit for low-income working families with children.
Many Democrats contend that an increase in the tax credit is essential to make the overall deficit-reduction package more progressive.

HEADLINE: Ex-Owner Of S.& L. Is Indicted

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 25

 BODY:
The former owner of the Western Savings Association, who led the Texas institution through a period of stunning growth in high-risk ventures, was indicted today by a Federal grand jury on 37 charges of bank fraud, misuse of funds and conspiracy. The failure of the savings institution is likely to cost taxpayers more than $1 billion.
The criminal charges against Jarrett E. Woods, who controlled Western between 1982 and 1986, were announced late this afternoon in Washington, nearly a week after Federal regulators filed a sweeping civil lawsuit seeking $560 million in damages from Mr. Woods for what it said were actions that defrauded the institution. 
 The damage amount listed in the civil case against Mr. Woods is one of the largest sought by the Government from former owners or executives of failed savings institutions. The civil case was filed in a Dallas Federal court last Friday, but its contents were not disclosed until this week.
 
Biggest Savings Bandits
 "The indictment of Jarrett Woods means that we have corralled one of the biggest savings and loan bandits in Texas," Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said. "The free-wheeling life style and fraudulent management practices that led to Western's collapse helped set the trend for our national thrift crisis."
A lawyer in Dallas representing Mr. Woods, Shirley Baccus-Lobel, said she was under a Federal court order not to discuss the criminal charges announced today.
Like dozens of Texas savings institutions that grew rapidly on savers' deposits attracted by high interest rates and gathered through brokerage firms, Western Savings had modest roots. Mr. Woods acquired its predecessor, Gatesville Savings, a small institution with $34 million in single-family mortgages, with a $2 million loan in 1982.
 
Real Estate Projects
 He changed the institution's name to Western Savings and began pouring deposits by the millions into several commercial real estate projects. Before Western was seized by regulators in 1986, Mr. Woods controlled nearly $2 billion in deposits.
The civil suit accused Mr. Woods of taking $7 million from Western's deposits in the waning months of his rule and using it to refinance his home, place money in his children's trust funds, retire a personal loan and pay himself an $800,000 bonus and a monthly salary of $41,667.
Western was closed by regulators in August 1988, and merged along with four other crippled institutions into Sunbelt Savings. Sunbelt, with more than $10 billion in assets, is now operating under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's control.
The charges focus on four transactions, continuing a strategy adopted by Federal prosecutors to present narrow, reasonably straightforward cases that they believe will persuade jurors. The maximum penalty on the 37 counts brought against Mr. Woods amount to 185 years in prison and $8.3 million in fines.
In one transaction, Mr. Woods was accused of diverting $15.8 million from a $60 million loan intended for the purchase and development of Houston properties through Baypointe Investments Inc., a company operated by one of Western's large borrowers, James Reagin. Instead, the $16 million was transferred to Mr. Reagin who used that money to meet payments on several delinquent loans at Western and other financial institutions.
In another case, Mr. Woods is said to have diverted $2.6 million in profit that Western was to receive from a property sale in Cedar Hill, a suburb of Dallas, to make additional payments on overdue loans held by Mr. Reagin.
Marvin Collins, the United States Attorney for Northern Texas, said Mr. Reagin's troubled loans of $64 million would have been sufficient by themselves to collapse Western in 1985 if the deficiencies had been found by Federal regulators.
"The indictment shows the great lengths to which people will go to deceive regulators," Mr. Collins told reporters.
 
Borrower Cooperates
 Mr. Reagin was not in the indictment. Richard Fishkin, the Government lawyer who heads the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force, said Mr. Reagin had agreed to cooperate with Federal prosecutors after pleading guilty to six charges involving savings institutions in Illinois and Wisconsin, as well as Western Savings.
In another dealing described by Government lawyers, Mr. Woods was accused of directing a subsidiary of Western Savings to pay a $48,000 commission to a company that had done nothing to earn the money. The payment covered a gambling debt Mr. Woods owed to that company's president, the Government said.
Mr. Woods is the 90th person formerly affiliated with savings institutions and banks accused of illegal activities by the Dallas task force since the group was organized in 1987.
In two years, the Justice Department has obtained convictions of 338 defendants in the largest savings industry prosecutions in the nation. Of those, about 255 have received jail sentences as well as court orders to repay $208 million to the Treasury.
Mr. Thornburgh applauded Congress for increasing the department's budget for pursuing savings-and-loan fraud and related crimes to $160 million for the 1991 fiscal year, a threefold increase over the $50 million committed in the last fiscal year.

Magazine Ad Pages Fell Again in September

 BODY:
Magazine publishers anxious about ad dollars have received more bleak news: Advertising pages for magazines monitored by the Publishers Information Bureau continue to decline.
In September, ad pages fell 4.5 percent. For the first nine months of this year, ad pages dropped 3.3 percent from a year earlier. 
 "We see that the softness has bottomed and that the top 10 advertising catagories are growing significantly," said James R. Guthrie, executive vice president for marketing development for the Magazine Publishers of America, which runs the Publisher Information Bureau.
"My guess is that by the end of this year ad dollars will be up about 3.5 percent," Mr. Guthrie said. "We're on an upswing with pages, which will probably be off between 2 and 2.5 percent for the year. As long as the economy doesn't get any softer, next year will be a slow-growth year."
Even as ad pages go down, ad rates continue to rise, so revenues for magazines measured by the Publishers Information Bureau were up 2.6 percent for the first three quarters, and 4.8 percent for September.
The revenue leaders for the first nine months were, in order: Time, TV Guide, People, Sports Illustrated, Newsweek, Business Week, Good Housekeeping, Fortune, Forbes and U.S. News & World Report.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail;
Democrats See Gains In the Polls

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Around the country poll takers are recording a swing to Democrats in the closing days of the election.
Incumbent Republican senators in Minnesota and Oregon, who seemed safe a few months ago, are suddenly threatened. Harvey Gantt, the Democrat seeking to unseat Senator Jesse Helms in North Carolina, was ahead in one recent poll, although the poll takers said skepticism was advisable in this race, as in others where a black candidate faces a white one. 
 Some Republicans talk about the "bottom dropping out" and fear double-digit loses in the House, where just a few weeks ago, buoyed by the Iraq confrontation, they had hoped to hold their own against the normal midterm losses of the party in the White House.
"I think it's going to be an anti-Republican vote, not anti-incumbent," said Curtis Gans of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
Some of the shift reflects the historically predictable response to rising economic anxiety. But the budget debacle has worsened the situation, shifting attention to economic issues at the worst possible moment for the Republicans.
President Bush is going out on the road, hoping he can stop the slide.Some Republican poll takers say their candidates hit bottom a few days ago and are bouncing back. But Representative Beryl Anthony Jr. of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, "The tone has been set for this election cycle."
Candidates for governor get more individual attention, and campaigns usually focus on more local issues.
But in Ohio, the Democrat, Anthony Celebrezze, has gotten back in the race with a campaign that echoes the national theme that the Democrats are being so succesful with: the Republicans are unfair to the middle class. Mr. Celebrezze attacks his opponent, former Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, for approving tax breaks for wealthy real estate developers.
In Texas, a spokesman for Clayton Williams, the Republican candidate for Governor, says the budget battle in Washington has hurt Mr. Williams and other Republicans. Ann Richards, the Democratic candidate, has pulled even with Mr. Williams in one new poll. She had been trailing badly a few weeks ago.
 
Cuomo Becomes A Punching Bag
 Maybe it's because things are not going so well for the Republicans in this year's elections that the chief party spokesman took an early swipe Wednesday at a potential Presidential contender in 1992, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York.
Charles Black, who is also a White House political adviser, said that Mr. Cuomo's record as Governor was filled with potential for the Republicans. "Cuomo looks like Dukakis without the competence," Mr. Black told a group of reporters at breakfast.
In Albany, Mr. Cuomo's chief spokesman, Gary Fryer, said Mr. Black was just the latest in a series of Republicans, including Vice President Dan Quayle and William J. Bennett, Director of National Drug Control Policy, to criticize the Governor.
"Based on the frequency with which this has happened in the last five or six months and based on the diversity of people involved this is clearly not a coincidence," Mr. Fryer said. "I think they're just trying to think of anyone to talk about other than them."
 
 Political War Erupts In Chicago Streets
 Has politics become too rough? Try the South Side of Chicago, where a dispute over campaign posters turned into a street brawl. One campaign worker was shot three times and then run over by a van.
The police say the argument was "politicially motivated," an outgrowth of a bitter race for sheriff of Cook County.
Supporters of Alderman Michael Sheahan, a Democrat who is challenging Sheriff James E. O'Grady, a Republican, were working on South Halstead Street early in the morning. Depending on who is telling the tale, they were either putting up Sheahan posters or tearing down O'Grady posters.
A group of O'Grady supporters spilled out of a local establishment, the Surf Lounge. Bottles and other projectiles were exchanged. O'Grady's camp says one of the Sheahan men swung a tire iron. The police say one of the O'Grady supporters drew a pistol from an ankle holster. Shots were fired.
Irving Bell, A sheriff's department guard who is supporting Mr. Sheahan, was hit three times. As he staggered down the street he was struck by the van, driven, depending on the version, by his friends trying to escape or by O'Grady backers. Three men, including a sheriff's deputy who supports Mr. O'Grady, were questioned in the shooting.
Mike Royko wrote in his columan in The Chicago Tribune on Wednesday: "We've been told that politics have become nothing but slick commercials, fast sound bites and mind manipulation by poll-juggling media advisers. Maybe so. But this is still Chicago. So once in a while we see the return of true grass-roots involvement."
From Gun Opponent To Gun Backer
 When she was in the Washington State Legislature, Jolene Unsoeld received failing grades from the National Rifle Association for her stands on gun control. But as a freshman Democratic Rrepresentative, struggling to keep her seat in a district that supports gun ownership, Ms. Unsoeld embraced legislation to insure the continued domestic production of semi-automatic rifles. The N.R.A. changed its view of Ms. Unsoeld, endorsing her in her tough re-election fight and contributing $5,950 to her re-election campaign. "We always accept battlefield conversions," said Jim Baker, the association's director of Federal affairs.
 
 Republicans Face Replacing Atwater
 Lee Atwater, the ailing Republican National chairman, continues to battle a brain tumor. His condition is improved, but leading Republicans say that after the election both Mr. Atwater and President Bush will have to face the question of whether a new chairman will be needed to handle the party's public duties through the 1992 Presidential campaign. Some names mentioned: Lynn Martin, who seems to be losing her bid to unseat Senator Paul Simon in Illinois, and Robert A. Mosbacher, the Commerce Secretary who is one of Mr. Bush's big fund-raisers. If the change is made, Republicans said, Mr. Atwater would be given a new title.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil-Related Inflation Fears Push Gold Prices Up Again

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices continued to climb yesterday as the resurgent oil market fanned inflation fears.
But platinum prices dropped sharply, reflecting declining Japanese investor interest and worldwide economic jitters. 
 Gold futures settled $2.30 to $2.40 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for spot delivery at $375.80 a troy ounce, up from $373.50 on Wednesday.
The increase marked gold's sixth daily advance in the last seven sessions, following a plunge to a three-month low of $360 on Oct. 16.
Silver futures settled 1.9 cents to 2 cents lower, with the spot price at $4.204 a troy ounce in lackluster trading on the Commodity Exchange.
Platinum was $6.60 to $8 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the spot price at $415.80 a troy ounce.
Analysts said demand for gold had increased as a result of lower prices for the metal and higher prices this week for crude oil, which has bounced back sharply amid intensifying Middle East war rhetoric.
"The war drums were beating today," said William O'Neill, a precious metals expert with Merrill Lynch.
Higher oil prices could portend higher inflation, which typically spurs investor demand for gold.
Higher oil prices also could tip industrialized nations into recession and reduce industrial demand for platinum, which is widely used in automobile pollution-control systems.
James Steel, an oil and metals analyst with Refco Inc., a commodities brokerage, said platinum was also under pressure from lower Japanese stock prices. The Japanese value platinum as an investment and jewelry metal.
In petroleum trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude oil settled $2 to $3.17 higher, with December at $34.25 a barrel.
Grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly in light trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting slack export demand and harvest pressure.
Speculation about possible Soviet purchases of United States corn cooled amid reports from Moscow indicating the Soviets might not make any more purchases to fulfill a one-million-ton corn agreement by the end of the year without United States credit.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Prices Up Slightly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
With a batch of weak economic data and Congress approaching agreement on a new Federal budget, credit market participants were persuaded to buy Treasury securities yesterday. Another sharp rise in oil prices was all but ignored.
While market participants fully expect the Federal Reserve to ease short-term interest rates once the budget is passed and signed into law, traders yesterday did not provide a ringing endorsement of the pact. Bond prices rose only slightly, and long-term interest rates dipped. 
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said recently that the Fed will fashion its response to the budget on how the credit markets react to a credible agreement.
The economic reports issued yesterday, which showed a sharp rise in initial unemployment claims for the week ended Oct. 13 and an 8 percent decline in existing home sales in September, helped to lift prices early.
So, too, did a slight dip in a key inflation measure, the Employment Cost Index. The figures, which are compiled quarterly, showed that inflation rose 5.2 percent for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, down from 5.4 percent at the end of the second quarter.
 
Backdrop for Auction
 The figures also provided a positive backdrop for the weekly auction yesterday of three-month and six-month Treasury bills, a sale that had been delayed since Monday by the impasse over the budget.
With a budget agreement apparently in hand, Congress late Wednesday approved another temporary increase in the Federal debt ceiling, which allowed the Treasury to hold the auction.
Abetted by the Federal Reserve, which had some $6 billion from bills that matured yesterday, traders said that demand for the new $17 billion worth of securities was very strong.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.20 percent, up slightly from an average 7.18 percent rate at the last sale on Oct. 15.
Bids on six-month bills produced an average rate of 7.16 percent, down from 7.22 percent at last week's sale. It is the lowest rate on a six-month bill since the auction of Sept. 1, 1988.
"There was a definite appetite for short-term securities," one Treasury bill trader said.
 
Sale of One-Year Bills
 An auction of one-year bills that has been delayed since Oct. 18 will be held today, the Treasury said.
Traders and analysts said they were relieved the struggle over the budget was coming to an end.
But applause for the reported substance of the agreement was muffled.
Though lacking details, analysts said the new budget, which appears to be long on tax increases and short on spending cuts, was likely to be a long-term negative for the fixed-income market.
"The markets are likely to be depressed by the shift toward higher taxes and more spending," said Susan M. Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
"In the 1980's, the problem that caused the deficits was that outlays soared and revenues were static. This budget looks like it will do little to reverse that trend."
Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities, said the economic effect of the budget cuts in the current fiscal year, reported to be around $35 billion, would be minimal.
"The effect on the economy in the short run is minor," he said, "because the amount they are talking about is small relative to the total economy."
 
Savings Are Doubted
 Mr. Levy added that would "bet anything" that the $500 billion in budget savings projected over the next five years will never be realized.
Nevertheless, the budget agreement, which still faces a problematic future when it comes to a vote in the House, was enough to spur some buying of Treasury securities yesterday.
In late trading, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 100, up 9/32, to yield 8.75 percent, compared with 8.77 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 29/ 32, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.60 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 19/32, up 1/ 32, to yield 7.78 percent.
A number of corporations offered new issues to investors in the investment-grade corporate bond market.
By far the largest issue was a $1.257 billion sale of securities backed by car loans by the Ford Motor Credit Corporation.
The 8 3/4 percent notes, which have an average life of 1.92 years, were priced at $99.28, 1.20 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In addition, Goldman, Sachs acted as lead manager for an offering of $200 million worth of four-year notes by Associates Corporation of North America.
The 9 percent securities were priced at $99.97 to yield 9.02 percent, 1.08 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent four-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AA-3 by Moody's and AA-minus by Standard & Poor's.
In other developments, prices of widely held high-yield "junk bonds" moved sharply higher yesterday, traders said, reversing some of the recent sharp declines.
Traders said the gains, which amounted to 2 to 3 points for some issues, were recorded on very thin trading.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, dealers said prices of most issues rose by about 1/4 point, in line with Treasuries.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, prices of widely quoted issues moved up by 3/8 point to 1/2 point, dealers said, pushed higher by clear signs that Federal income taxes are about to be raised.

HEADLINE: Price of Oil Surges by $3.17, Continuing on Erratic Path

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Oil was up sharply yesterday for the second consecutive day, continuing on an erratic path.
Crude for December delivery closed at $34.25 a barrel, up $3.17, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In trading yesterday and Wednesday, the price of oil was up $4.88, or 16.6 percent, and many traders expect it to go back toward the $40 range. 
 "I don't think there's much point trying to make sense out of the thing," said Ken Miller of the OPEC Listener, an energy newsletter. "It's just more of the same of what's been going on throughout this crisis, just total fluctuation on the latest rumors. You can go through the wire and pick out which one favors your viewpoint."
Yesterday's rumors included one that pushed prices up by about 80 cents in the last few minutes of trading: that American troops had entered Kuwait. Traders also said a story in The International Herald Tribune, quoting an associate of Francois Mitterrand as saying that the French President expects a war, also pushed up prices, despite a denial from French officials later in the day.
Prices were also pushed up by a statement from Dick Cheney, the Defense Secretary, that more troops would be sent to the Persian Gulf and that the United States did not rule out forcibly evicting Iraq.
Clearly the war worries that waned last Friday and Monday were growing again yesterday. At SHB Commodities, Carl A. Cunneff, an oil trader, said, "It's more tension than anything."
Mr. Cunneff said Monday's drop, which came to about 15 percent in oil for November delivery, had overshot the mark. A lot of people who regretted that they had not bought contracts in September and October when the price was lower were lured into the market this week when the price went below $30, he said, and that rush has helped drive prices higher.
Thomas P. Blakeslee of Pegasus Econometric Group said, "The market is hungry for rumors." But he said he doubted that the market would go back to $40 without "some military justification."
"I don't think it has enough steam to reach the high of $41.15 without guns being fired," he said. That price, the peak in trading on the exchange, was reached on Oct. 10.
But Victor S. Yu at Prudential- Bache securities said the market could test its previous high soon.
"The market's undergoing a period when it's trying to figure out what it wants to do," he said.
The factors driving crude pushed product prices even harder; wholesale gasoline for delivery next month was up 8.21 cents a gallon, or about $3.45 a barrel, to 93.60 cents a gallon, and heating oil was up 6.55 cents a gallon, or $2.75 a barrel, to 91.67 cents.
 
Demand for Heating Oil
 Demand for heating oil has been lower than expected lately, perhaps because of unseasonably warm weather in the Northeast and a decision by consumers and dealers who remember last December's cold to stock up early. But inventory figures on gasoline released Tuesday evening showed a substantial drop in inventories, a bullish factor. Some analysts said yesterday that speculators were selling heating oil futures contracts and buying gasoline contracts.
The volatility in prices has caught the attention of consumer advocates. Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, complained in a letter to the United States Department of Justice that crude prices had fallen $10 from their peak on Oct. 10 but that gasoline and heating oil prices had not; gasoline, in fact, rose 2.4 cents a gallon in New York last week, reaching $1.474, he said, up 32.5 cents since Aug. 3. Home heating oil prices fell a fraction of a penny last week, to to $1.343 a gallon, he said, up 38.8 cents since the beginning of the crisis. Product prices rose immediately when crude prices did in August, he said, and now they should fall immediately.
Oil companies say that the price of gasoline never caught up with crude oil at the peak.

Races to Watch: An Update

 BODY:

Major races around the nation that polls how to be close or nearly even.
 
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR
 
No one issue is the central battleground. A debate was canceled last night because the federal budget battle has kept Senator Pet Wilson, the Republican, in Washington. Another debate with Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat, is unlikely, so the main factor in the final days will be a new barrage of television advertising.
 
FLORIDA GOVERNOR
 
Lawton Chiles, a Democratic and former United States Senator, is running an anti-big money, anti-special interest campaign. The incumbent, Bob Martinez, a Republican, is using an expensive television campaign that portrays him as a dynamic governor from humble beginnings who can admit he made mistakes.
 
MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR
 
Things are turning nasty. John R. Silber, the Democrat, has accused his Republican opponent, William F. Weld, "back stabbing" for having left the Justice Department to protest the policies and leadership of Edwin Meese 3d. Mr. Weld is calling the Democratic a "Dr. Know-It-All" who is doing nothing bu "spewing venom." The economy remains the key issue. Mr. Weld supports a mandatory cut in taxes; Mr. Silber opposes it.
 
NORTH CAROLINA SENATOR
 
Harvey Gantt, the Democrat, has matched Jesse Helms, the three-term Republican incumbent, in fund raising over the past three months and has managed to do what none of Mr. Helms' other opponents have done - put him on the defensive on issues like education and the environment.
 
TEXAS GOVERNOR
 
The Democrat, Ann Richards, who was behind when she was short on funds, raised enough money to keep her ads on television. Clayton Williams, the Republican, seems to have trouble painting the race as a clear-cut choice between a conservative and a liberal.

HEADLINE: Warts and All, a Budget Victory

 BODY:
It took four months, a Government shutdown and the threat of two more, and the pressure of public disgust to get the job done. But now, finally, Congress is about to approve a credible and fair budget bill that will drive the deficit downward over the next five years.
The bill is full of quirks and half steps. And it makes two glaring errors, on capital gains and public investment. Yet it achieves substantial deficit reduction without hurting the poor or ravaging domestic programs. On balance, it will help the economy and open the way for Congress to get on with other pressing business.
 The quirks and half steps need candid appraisal. The bill promises to cut the deficit by $40 billion next year and $500 billion over five years. It won't. Next year's hit, counting expenditures in the Persian Gulf, will be closer to $30 billion. And the $500 billion estimate is based on improbable projections.
The package would hike the gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon; a boost of 20 cents or more would conserve energy. The legislation does not eliminate a single weapons system. Entitlements were barely nicked. The ugly tax bubble -- whereby some families are hit with a higher marginal tax rate than other families with higher incomes -- remains.
None of these flaws, however, are fatal. What comes close is the provision concerning capital gains. Wednesday morning, the Bush campaign to lower the tax on the profit from selling stocks, bonds and other investments was declared dead and buried. But by evening a strange, stunted version was back on the docket. For wealthy families, the budget conferees would lower the capital gains tax to 28 percent, even though ordinary income would be taxed at 31 percent.
Why? No serious economist would argue that a cut this small could raise national saving, investment and growth. Its only purpose would be to hand wealthy families windfall profits on past investments. At a time when everyone else will be paying higher taxes, this provision is unconscionable.
The other unforgivable provision is a three-year cap on discretionary domestic programs. A provision that would require Congress to pay for new spending by raising taxes or cutting programs would make sense. But the budget bill veers irresponsibly in another direction. It would forbid Congress from spending more on child nutrition even if it would decide to spend less on missiles. In short, the bill would prevent Congress from doing what it is elected to do: make choices.
Despite these provisions, the budget deal makes subtantial progress. Over the next five years, it will push the deficit down decisively, and this time the budget cuts are real. Gone are the one-shot tricks and accounting scams Congress has routinely used in the past.
Six months ago, the agriculture committees were figuring out how to raise farm subsidies; the budget package will cut them by a whopping 25 percent. Well-to-do families will pay more for Medicare, setting a constructive precedent. And the package denies Mr. Bush his destructive proposal to cut the capital gains tax all the way to 15 percent.
For all the public disgust over dissembling and delay, Congress labored to make the budget package fair. It succeeded. Taxes on the poor will fall. Taxes on the very rich will rise by more than 6 percent. Everyone else will face a modest tax increase of roughly 2 percent.
Perhaps the finest part of the package is a decision to heap tax benefits on a segment of the population that hires no lobbyists: the working poor. Congress is prepared to approve an unprecedented increase in tax credits for poor parents who work as a way of helping them pay for quality child care and insulating them from excise tax increases.
The process wasn't noble. The product isn't exactly pretty. But, with the exception of two glaring flaws, Congress has done its duty.

HEADLINE: Financial World Will Give New York City Time for a Good Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
After Mayor David N. Dinkins reached a settlement with the United Federation of Teachers, outlined an omnibus criminal-justice program, imposed an immediate hiring freeze and instructed New York City agencies to propose options to cut spending by up to $800 million for the Nov. 8 modification of our financial plan, you argue ("New York's Fears Won't Wait," editorial, Oct. 10) that Nov. 8 is too long to wait for a plan that protects the city's financial stability.
"What makes City Hall think a worried financial world will wait?" you ask.
Consider the views of members of that financial world. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have said it is reasonable for the city to be given until Nov. 8. The private members of the Financial Control Board agree.
You believe we should put all negotiations with municipal unions on hold until fiscal concerns are addressed. But if we achieve satisfactory settlements, doesn't it make sense to conclude those agreements before Nov. 8? That insures that the modification is as full and accurate an accounting of our fiscal position as possible.
This is not a planner's esoteric exercise. The city must enter the credit markets in November to meet its cash flow requirements to pay employees' wages and for services rendered by contractors. Before it does, doesn't it make sense to have as credible a financial plan as possible?
Uncertainty might ultimately reduce our access to the market and, even worse, spark a resumption of the Financial Control Board in running the city's fiscal affairs. Having sacrificed so much to restore New York's fiscal independence, we should avoid any steps that might cause us to lose it.
"The surest way for Mr. Dinkins to restore confidence in his administration and in the city," you argue, "is to present a financial plan quickly." Only, if "quickly" is synonymous with "completely." Which it isn't.
In recent weeks, the Mayor has consulted with private members of the Financial Control Board, with his Council of Economic Advisors, with Standard & Poor's and Moody's, with municipal unions, with the Comptroller, the City Council Speaker and daily with his deputy mayors and budget director. These meetings are proving invaluable as we prepare a complete, credible, achievable and balanced Nov. 8 modification.
You hint such meetings are a waste of time. The Mayor, you argue, should move full steam ahead, not consulting the experts, ignoring those experienced in fiscal crises. That approach runs the great risk that the plan will be seen as a new, unconnected event, triggering a new round of criticism and devastating consequences to the city's well-being.
Were balancing a budget like a horse race, your counsel might make sense. But what wins at the track doesn't necessarily prevail in the financial markets.

HEADLINE: The Founders Dreamt of a Classless Society;
Grow Up, America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In writing about the myth of classlessness (Op-Ed, Oct. 10), asserting that much of our governmental structure and purpose is heavily biased in favor of wealth and the well born, Benjamin DeMott exhibits proper liberal outrage but blurred focus. Republican Party adulation for the dollar in the last dozen years has suffered from neither subtlety nor restraint. Questions of fairness and even logic have not been permitted to interfere with conservative orthodoxy. Yes, we have become a very classy society. But where's the myth?
The far larger threat is the direction we have taken, the garden path down which we have increasingly been led, in the manifest and growing immaturity of all of us, leaders and followers, Democrats and Republicans, the United States.
The most interesting example of our immaturity is to be seen in taxation, the necessary lubricant of government. Hundreds of thousands of the new-rich wallow in a largesse created by a genial benefactor, Ronald Reagan, who had more savvy about make-believe and mob psychology than economics. He chopped the top income tax rates of our luckiest or wealthiest from 70 percent to 28 percent. At the same time, he borrowed trillions of dollars from those same
people, as well as from the Japanese and Germans, to pay for the monstrous, quickly ballooning, deficits.
With an ever-growing population in this country, with the almost ceaseless toll of inflation and with ever-developing social needs, taxes must increase. We cannot avoid or repeal that reality. But we must, too, accept that the need for hope in our ghettos and homes for our homeless exceeds the need for greed of the most fortunate among us.
George Bush quibbles about whether top tax rates should be raised from 28 percent to 31 percent or 33 percent, while he expresses no concern for increasing the tax burden of the couple struggling with an income of $30,000 or $40,000 a year. Restoring the top rates to the 90 percent they once were might be a bit too much and too sudden. But a return to a rate approaching the pre-Reagan 70 percent, for income exceeding $200,000 or $500,000, could signal a return to fairness and adult responsibility. With those rates we once were the economic world leader, before Ronald Reagan (with the compliance of the Democrats and a supine Congress) gave away the store.

Unisys Had Big Deficit In 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Citing "the pronounced softness of demand in the worldwide computer industry," the Unisys Corporation yesterday reported a third-quarter deficit of $356.8 million. The troubled computer maker also said it would eliminate 5,000 jobs.
The company, based in Blue Bell, Pa., said a fourth-quarter loss was now very possible, contrary to its recent expectations. 
The deficit for the quarter ended Sept. 30, included a $181 million charge to cover the cost of the reductions.
 "Given this difficult business environment, we are sizing our operations on the assumption that order activity will continue to be weak," said James A. Unruh, the company's president and chief executive who yesterday added the additional title of chairman.
 W. Michael Blumenthal resigned from the non-executive post in order to spend more time at the Paris headquarters of Lazard Freres & Company's international group. Mr. Blumental, who retired as the Unisys chief executive in April, is a limited partner in the investment banking firm and co-chairman of its international coordinating group.
 
$200 Million Savings Seen
 Mr. Unruh said the job cuts and other stringent cost control actions would save the company more than $200 million a year.
 Unisys stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $3.375, down from a 52-week high of $17.125 in March.
 In the third quarter a year ago, the company reported a loss of $648.2 million. The 1989 third quarter included a $231 million restructuring charge to cover the cost of eliminating 8,000 jobs. At the end of 1989 the company had 82,300 employees, according to the company's annual report.
 Revenue for the third quarter was $2.4 billion, compared with $2.35 billion a year ago.
 Mr. Unruh attributed the third-quarter loss to a weakening of general business conditions and a slump in worldwide computer sales. "Order growth in the United States continues to be weak and orders have slowed significantly in Europe in recent weaks," he said.
 Unisys said the weak economy would hamper its efforts to reduce its $2.59 billion in long-term debt. The company had said it planned to reduce its debt by $600 million to $800 million this year, but Mr. Unruh said yesterday that that would be difficult, but not impossible.
 The company has hired Lazard Freres and another investment banker, James D. Wolfensohn Inc., to sell assets to reduce debt.
 It has been a difficult fall for Unisys, which was created in 1986 by the combination of the Burroughs Corporation and the Sperry Corporation. In September, the company's board voted to omit the 25-cent-a-share quarterly dividend in a move intended to save the company $160 million a year. Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service downgraded its rating of the Unisys debt to below investment grade.

HEADLINE: Anti-Florio Fever Is Giving A Headache to a Democrat

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
By many traditional political measures, Rob Andrews ought to be running away in the race for the First Congressional District seat.
He has been campaigning virtually nonstop for more than a year, while his opponent, Dan Mangini, took time off from work only this month to campaign full time. Mr. Andrews is the Democrat in a heavily Democratic district, and he has raised more than $300,000, to Mr. Mangini's $30,000. 
 The 32-year-old Mr. Andrews spits out answers on issues like a computer; Mr. Mangini, who is 57, called in an issues adviser from Washington a couple of weeks ago, and his position on the emotional issue of abortion seems to be all over the place.
And finally, Mr. Mangini has a "resume problem": he claims to have studied at aninstitution that has no record of him. Yet Rob Andrews is running hard, and he admits, "I'm running scared."
The reason is voters like Mary Natale, who stopped to talk with Mr. Mangini as he shook hands in a shopping center in Woodbury.
 
A Man in Trenton
 "Florio did us in good," said Mrs. Natale, who voted for Jim Florio for Governor last year. "I'm ashamed of myself. He was not going to raise taxes. And he was not even in office before he knew what he was going to do."
Mr. Mangini encouraged her. "You were lied to, you see."
"He made fools of us!" Mrs. Natale said with some heat.
"You send them a message," Mr. Mangini said. "Put me in office. I'm the opposite party."
Mr. Florio represented the First District for 16 years, and he was enormously popular. But that ended when he became governor and, having said in his campaign that no new taxes were necessary, promptly rammed through a $2.8 billion tax increase.
"Jim Florio doesn't have a tax problem; he has a credibility problem," concedes Mr. Andrews, who is perceived as Mr. Florio's hand-picked successor. "Jim Florio in the First District was thought of as somebody different, somebody you could trust. Now, the thought is, we got duped."
Mr. Mangini, a Gloucester County Freeholder who agreed to run for the seat only when assured he would have no Republican primary opposition, seemed unprepared three weeks ago when a poll commissioned by the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee early this month showed him virtually even with Mr. Andrews, the odds-on favorite. The poll showed the main reason to be voter resentment of the Florio tax increase.
Mr. Mangini acknowledged at a news conference called to announce the poll results that an adviser was coming up from Washington to brief him on issues. Now he loses no opportunity to refer to his opponent as "a Florio clone." And the issue, he says, is "taxes, taxes, taxes."
"The guy's not running for Congress," Mr. Andrews said. "He's running on a protest vote."
 
Mangini Has Problems, Too
 "For obvious reasons," Mr. Andrews said in an interview, "we want the race to focus on me and on my opponent, and not on Florio. Even if Florio were exceedingly popular and we brought him in to campaign, the perception would be, 'He's Jim's caddy; he's Jim's understudy.' People want their own man."
Since the poll, Mr. Mangini has run into some political problems of his own.
On his resume, he has for years stated that he attended Drexel University, but the school has no record of his attendance. Mr. Mangini has conceded that he was never enrolled as a student.
In an interview, Mr. Mangini, who works for Glencoe Star, a commercial refrigeration manufacturer in Philadelphia, said, "I worked for General Electric when I got out of high school, and our training was we went to school a couple of hours a week, and we were told what we were taught there was the same as being at Drexel."
"What happened was I quit there, some kind of difficulties with the boss, and I guess they never transferred it over. I never questioned it for 38 years."
 
Approval Withdrawn
 Mr. Andrews, a lawyer who is a summa cum laude graduate of Bucknell and a magna cum laude graduate of Cornell Law School, says, "The first responsibility of a candidate is to tell the truth."
Mr. Mangini has also had some trouble with the abortion issue, first identifying himself as "pro-choice" but later saying that he did not favor allowing abortion after the first trimester under any circumstances.
The Women's Political Caucus of New Jersey, which had intially approved the positions of both candidates on abortion, last week withdrew its endorsement of Mr. Mangini and now supports only Mr. Andrews, who fully supports the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision on abortion, which allows abortions after the first three months with some restrictions.
"Mangini is not pro-choice, he's multiple choice," Mr. Andrews said.
Both candidates say the economy is the major issue and that New Jersey is in a recession. Mr. Andrews pledges not to vote for any tax increase in his first term and to return to voters with his position before the next election. Mr. Mangini says he would oppose any tax increase while in office, except for a major emergency like war.
Mr. Mangini would bring most United States troops home from aboad, while Mr. Andrews would ask host countries to pay for them.
Both candidates say the Florio tax increase is a state issue, but Mr. Mangini says it should be rolled back, while Mr. Andrews opposes the sales tax increase but supports the income tax increase on wealthier taxpayers to provide property tax relief.

HEADLINE: Rally in Oil Is Short-Lived; Crude Closes $1.24 Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices seesawed on the futures market yesterday, closing more than $1 a barrel lower after a rally based on war fears ran out of steam and traders began to sell.
"They've taken it all over the place," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "The market is so hungry for news, and without the rumors and news it's come off slightly." 
 Crude oil fell $1.24 a barrel, to $33.01, for December delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil had traded as high as $35.40 a barrel yesterday before the selloff began.
 
 Other Contracts Fall
 Contracts for delivery in later months all closed lower after they also retreated from previous gains.
Oil began the day by moving up about $1 as speculators again bet that war was likely in the Persian Gulf. Crude then began to tumble on hints of possible diplomatic solutions.
Traders were responding partly to a news report that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq sent a conciliatory letter to President Francois Mitterrand of France, although French officials said they had no knowledge of such a letter.
The market was also moved by news of Soviet diplomatic efforts in the Mideast.
Prices also declined as many traders expressed reluctance to hold too many oil contracts over the weekend. Fresh in their minds was the record plunge of $5.41 a barrel on Monday, the last day of trading for the November contract.
After that tumble, oil rebounded strongly with gains of $1.71 on Wednesday and $3.17 on Thursday. But for the week, crude was down 78 cents for next-month delivery.
 
 Refined Products Also Seesaw
 As crude prices shot up and then tumbled yesterday, futures contracts for refined petroleum products moved in a similar pattern.
Wholesale home heating oil closed down 3.42 cents, at 88.25 cents a gallon, for November delivery contracts, with most later contract months moving lower. For the week, heating oil dropped 0.15 cent.
November contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 2.13 cents a gallon, to 91.47 cents, with most other delivery months trading lower. For the week, gasoline was up 3.56 cents.
Oil's big swings seemed to be coming closer together, analysts said, sending the market further in less time than it had been moving in recent weeks.
"The volatility's been extremely high," said William Byers, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. "There is some sense that time is running out on the situation. Whether that's a correct perception, I don't know."
Many traders have asserted that any military action against Iraq is likely to occur shortly before or shortly after the United States elections, which are less than two weeks away, Mr. Byers said.
Mr. Blakeslee of Pegasus said the wild swings had occurred on light volume, as small traders felt the need to make trades quickly based on news developments and rumors.
"The market will move very quickly on their panicking -- if you want to call it that -- or buying," he said. "Someone with deep pockets will withstand these moves."

Baker Visiting Saudis Soon To Coordinate Next Steps

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The White House said tonight that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d would soon go to Saudi Arabia to coordinate with the Saudis on the next steps toward resolving the Persian Gulf crisis.
Speaking to reporters in Los Angeles, where President Bush was on an election campaign swing, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the visit would involve "a general discussion of the situation in the gulf." 
 The Baker trip is expected to begin late next week. His visit, coupled with the decision to send as many as 100,000 more American troops to the Persian Gulf and to add hundreds of advanced tanks to the American force there, suggest that the Bush Administration has determined that it needs to make its threat of force against Baghdad more credible.
 
Actions Speaking Louder
 Judging from what Washington is doing, more than from what it is saying, it appears that after several weeks of relying on sanctions and diplomacy alone to move Baghdad, the Administration has concluded that a more threatening posture is needed.
Relying on diplomacy alone has led to a loss of momentum, has invited President Hussein to believe that he might be able to split the coalition by freeing some hostages, like the French, has encouraged some Saudi officials to put out compromise feelers to Baghdad and has undermined Washington's coercive diplomatic approach.
The approach is designed to drive President Hussein to an unconditional withdrawal by convincing him that if he stays in Kuwait he will face a war and lose.
The White House said today that President Bush telephoned President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on Thursday to discuss developments in the region. Late on Thursday, Congress approved the President's request to forgive Egypt's $7.5 billion military debt.
Administration officials said the call to King Fahd was to thank him for his unambiguous statements in the last week, which, in contrast to those of the Saudi Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, made it unambiguously clear that Saudi Arabia still insists on an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. Officials said the President emphasized to the Saudi King that it was important that the countries speaking in one voice.
 
No Final Plans
 Earlier in the day, as the State Department refused to confirm the Baker trip publicly, officials said privately that a trip to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and London with other stops was likely, but that the itinerary had not yet been made final for two reasons.
First, the White House has not decided what Mr. Baker's message to the allies should be. Will he simply go out to bolster the coalition, or will he go out to line up their backing for a military operation or other steps against Baghdad? The question, officials say, has not yet been resolved.
The Baker trip "should tell us which way the Administration is heading," one Arab diplomat said.
The other, less important, reason that the itinerary has not yet been made final is because at the moment Israel is not on the tentative schedule, Administration officials are concerned about potential negative domestic political consequences of yet another Baker visit to the Middle East that would not take in Israel.
Mr. Baker traveled to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in September, but did not stop in Israel, where he is yet to visit.
Administration officials said Mr. Baker would consider a stop in Israel if the Israeli Government could find a way to resolve the dispute with the United Nations Security Council, which has asked Israel to cooperate with an investigation of the killing of 21 Palestinians at Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem on Oct. 8. Israel has refused.
Israeli and American officials say they believe a Baker visit to clear the air between them could be useful now, but only if it comes in the context of a resolution of Israel's differences with the United Nations. Otherwise, officials fear, a visit could make things worse. Washington joined other Security Council members in condemning Israel this week for not accepting the United Nations mission.
In another matter relating to the gulf crisis, Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said today that the Bush Administration believed Jordan was complying fully with the sanctions against Iraq and deserved Western assistance for its ailing economy.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
Major Legislation Moves Ahead in Both Houses of Congress

 BODY:

Clean Air
The House approved a House-Senate-White House agreement to amend the air pollution law for the first time in 13 years. The action is widely considered to be one of the major achievements of the 101st Congress.
It makes important changes in regulations of emissions of chemicals into the air by factories, electric utilities, automobiles and other sources of pollution. Economists estimated the cost to industry and individuals at $25 billion to $35 billion a year.
 
Military Budget
 The Senate passed a House-Senate agreement to set military spending at $268 billion, $17 billion less than last year. Only $3 billion of the $35 billion in research and development goes to the "Star Wars" anti-missile system, the lowest level of spending on it in several years.
The Senate is also set to take up a military authorization bill setting broad policy guidelines and allowing $288 billion in programs, including some money to be spent in later years.
The Stealth bomber program continues, but at sharply reduced levels. The Pentagon is directed to spend more on fast ships and heavy cargo planes for deployments like the one in the Arabian Peninsula. The measures would allow money to be spent that had been contributed by foreign nations for the Arabian operations.
 
Money Laundering
 The House passed by voice vote an anti-money-laundering measure that passed the Senate earlier.
It permits Federal agencies to revoke charters of banks and other financial institutions in which an employee is found guilty of obscuring the source of money.
The Treasury Department will complete guidelines by Feb. 15 on discouraging money laundering by electronic transfer. A study will be performed on whether bar codes on paper money can help track narcotics transactions.
 
Food Labeling
 The House, on a voice vote, adopted the Senate version of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, which curtails disease-prevention claims on food packages and requires more nutrition information for virtually all grocery foods.
 
Foreign Aid
 House and Senate negotiators agreed on $15.5 billion in foreign aid, allowing the Administration to forgive Egypt's $6.7 billion military debt, in exchange for Egypt's joining in the buildup in Saudi Arabia.
But military aid to El Salvador would be cut in half, to $42 million, in a blow to Central America policies.
In a break from past practice, a set sum is not earmarked for Pakistan, usually the third-largest recipient of military assistance. The United States has expressed concerns over nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
Cash military and economic aid of $3 billion is given to Israel , and $700 million worth of military equipment would be transferred from American stockpiles. Egypt gets $2.1 billion of cash aid.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
U.N. Council Appears Close to Accord on a Tougher Stance Against Iraq

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council appeared close to agreement tonight on a new resolution declaring Iraq responsible for financial losses caused by its invasion of Kuwait and ordering governments to present evidence of war crimes committed by its forces there, diplomats involved in the negotiations said.
This new resolution, designed to increase pressure on President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait and focus world attention on the gulf crisis again, threatens Iraq with further punitive mesures if it refuses to obey. But it also asks the Secretary General of the United Nations to make another effort to find a peaceful solution. 
 The emerging agreement, confirmed by American, Cuban and Malaysian diplomats, is expected to reassert the Security Council's unity in the crisis by bridging a potentially serious split that had developed between some of its 15 members.
Led by the United States and Britain, the five permanent Council members with veto powers wanted a tough new resolution calling on all countries to draw up financial claims against Iraq and collect evidence of human rights violations. The three other permanent members with veto powers are the Soviet Union, France and China.
But four of the nonaligned members -- Columbia, Cuba, Malaysia and Yemen -- favored a more moderate approach, a resolution merely asking the Secretary General to use his "good offices" to promote "a peaceful solution" to the gulf crisis. The final compromise is expected to combine both approaches, diplomats said.
 
Negotiating Through the Night
 In addition, the new omnibus resolution demands an end to all hostage-taking, pillaging and looting by Iraqi forces in Kuwait. And it says that Baghdad must resupply the handful of foreign embassies still holding out there with food and water. If Iraq fails to comply, the Council threatens "further enforcement mesures under the Charter."
Western diplomats say this can only mean a resolution invoking Article 42 of the Charter, which allows the Council to enforce its decisions by military might if it believes economic sanctions have failed.
Article 41, under which the Council has already imposed such sanctions on Iraq, also allows it to sever all telecommunication links with an offending country as well as diplomatic relations. But Council members say they do not want to do this.
The emerging agreement follows prolonged negotiations lasting throughout Thursday night and all of today. The Council's other nonaligned members -- Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Zaire -- have supported the tougher permanent members' draft all along, as have the three other northern rotating members, Canada, Finland and Romania.
The United States is seeking quick approval of its resolution tonight so it can refocus the Council's attthe on the gulf crisis after the two resolutions it approved earlier this month criticizing Israel over the killing of 21 Palestinians in Jerusalem on Oct. 8.
 
Speedy Action Sought
 Another reason for acting speedily, diplomats say, is to keep the debate over the new gulf resolution from running into next week, when it might become intertwined with discussion of a report the Secretary General is to present on ways of safeguarding Palestinians against further Israeli violence in the occupied territories.
The four dissidents include the Council's only two predominantly Muslim members and its two Latin American members. They argued that President Hussein may now be willing to compromise over Kuwait and that the Council should therefore give priority to seeking a negotiated solution.
The five permanent members disagreed, saying that adopting a mild resolution now that does not put additional pressure on Baghdad will only encourage President Hussein to believe the international coalition against him is crumbling.
Although they already have the nine votes needed to pass their resolution, the five are also striving to keep the Security Council as unified as possible in its approach to the gulf crisis.

KEEP TO HARD LINE, SAUDI KING ORDERS

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 26

 BODY:
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has ordered an end to further conciliatory-sounding remarks to Iraq like those made early this week by his brother, the Saudi Defense Minister.
Apparently seeking to stop speculation about a possible shift in the Saudi position, King Fahd signaled a more hawkish stand on the Persian Gulf crisis when he issued an unusually harsh statement Wednesday night in which he said there could be no compromise in the demand for total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. 
 The remarks by the King, who has made few such substantive comments since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, had the effect of banning any dissenting views from public discussion here. His intervention was apparently prompted in part by concern expressed by Washington about comments from Saudi Arabia suggesting less than complete adherence to the anti-Iraqi coalition's demand for a total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
King Fahd's statement outlined principles for a settlement with Iraq including the pullout from Kuwait, the return of the Kuwaiti Government that was deposed in the invasion, the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from positions near Saudi borders and guarantees that no future aggression by the "ruler of Iraq" would be carried out against any gulf nation.
 
Defense Minister's Remarks
 On Sunday, the Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, answering a question from a journalist, said, "Saudi Arabia has said, and says now, that giving rights, including territorial brotherly concessions -- given willingly -- is a matter of pride for the Arab nation."
He later issued several statements clarifying his remarks and saying they had been misinterpreted. Although he stressed that any negotiations could not begin before an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, he apparently failed to put to rest suspicions of weakening Saudi resolve.
King Fahd, in his statement Wednesday, stressed that Saudi demands for an Iraqi withdrawal "are not subject to bargaining or misinterpretations" and that "any understandings or predictions that fall outside those clear parameters" emanating from any individuals "or are yet to be uttered in the future" are "untrue and should be paid no attention at all."
The King's comments were followed by many comments from various senior officials and a stream of editorials in the semi-official Saudi press that used language so aggressive that they caused Saudis as well as foreign diplomats here to speculate on when, not if, war with Iraq would begin.
Departing from the usually ambiguous phraseology that characterizes most Saudi pronouncements, the King's statement affirmed in clear language Saudi Arabia's determination that "invading Iraqi troops must withdraw unconditionally and immediately from all Kuwaiti territory, where the legitimate authority must be reinstituted" in the person of the Emir of Kuwait and the ruling Sabah family.
Saudi officials and newspaper editors said they took the King's statement to mean that any talk of conciliation with Iraq by any of them must end immediately.
"To the degree that there was a debate about various options to resolve the gulf crisis, the King has put an end to it," a Saudi newspaper editor who asked not to be identified said in an interview tonight. "It was a signal to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq not to mistake various appeals for a peaceful withdrawal as a weakness of our resolve to fight him."
Indeed, the King's remarks, which one official described as "practically a countdown to war," appeared intended not only to reassure foreign allies of Saudi Arabia, including the United States and Egypt, about Saudi positions on Iraq, but also to signal to the Saudi people that if war breaks out, hard times may follow.
 
Sharp Change in Tone
 The change in the tone of Saudi public discourse on the gulf crisis over the last several days contrasted sharply with what had been a far more complacent attitude that was dominant over the last few weeks.
Several prominent Saudis as well as ordinary citizens said they had become convinced that a peaceful settlement with Iraq was the Saudi goal and an imperative alternative to what could be widespraed economic dislocation in case of war. In private conversations, these Saudis had started to call upon Kuwait to sacrifice some of its territory for the sake of a settlement.
On Sunday Prince Sultan, who is second in line for the throne, suggested that Kuwait might grant Iraq an outlet on the Persian Gulf in return for its withdrawal from that country. The episode stood out as highly unusual in a country intent on projecting in its policy declarations an image of steady, calm and controlled decision-making.
 
Questions Asked Privately
 While the King's edict has mobilized the Government and semi-official press, it has not stilled questions asked privately by business and other leading Saudi figures about the wisdom of letting matters slip into a war that could be devastating to Saudi institutions, the economy and social welfare.
But in this country, where obedience to the King is paramount, his statement will insure that other public fiures, like Prince Sultan, will refrain from expressing further views on the matter.
In his remarks, disseminated by the official Saudi News Agency in the form of answers to questions, the King outlined four "fixed and unchanged" principles to correct what he described as the "sinful Iraqi aggression upon our sisterly Kuwaiti nation."
He said the points were the condemnation of the Iraqi aggression "and the rejection of all consequent measures" that have resulted from it; the application of resolutions adopted by the Arab summit meeting, the Arab League and the United Nations Security Council; an unconditional Iraqi pullout from Kuwait; the return of Kuwait's legitimate Government, and the "withrawal of all Iraqi troop concentrations on the Saudi borders, accompanied with guarantees that the aggression of the Iraqi ruler will not be repeated against any other gulf nation."
 
Iraq's Allies Denounced
 The Saudi press followed the King's remarks with articles in Thursday's and today's papers strongly criticizing Arab countries allied with Iraq, including a harsh campaign against Yemen, Jordan and the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
In a typical comment directed at Jordan, the daily Al Riyadh in a front-page editorial today said that Jordan had never contributed much to the Arab nation, whether it knew which course to take or "continued to flounder as it is now."

HEADLINE: ACCORD REACHED ON RIDDING SKIES OF NOISY PLANES

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
After nearly a week of intense negotiations, Congressional leaders and the Administration agreed today on major legislation that would eliminate most of the airlines' noisier passenger jets from the nation's skies by the turn of the century.
In return for quieter airplanes, the agreement would restrict the ability of most cities and towns to impose noise regulations of their own. And local governments could impose arrival and departure fees on passengers and use the money for expansions and improvements at local airports. 
 The agreement will be attached to the broad budget measure that is being presented to Congress,said Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota, the House's principal negotiator on the issue.
 
New National Policy
 "The policy issues have been decided," Mr. Oberstar said. Staff members of the House, the Senate and the Department of Transportation were told to write the provision immediately so it could be adopted this weekend, before the Congress adjourns.
Mr. Oberstar and Senator Wendell K. Ford, a Kentucky Democrat, agreed late in the day to establish the national policy on airport noise. The agreement would protect existing local anti-noise regulations, and a few airports that were in the middle of imposing new rules would be allowed to do so. But for most communities, new regulations will have to be negotiated with the airports and airlines, and the Federal Government will arbitrate any disputes.
Unlike previous versions of the legislation, the agreement reached today would not increase the number of daily flights allowed at La Guardia Airport in New York.
The new noise regulations would not require that any particular models of airliners be taken out of service, since most jets can be modified to make them quieter.
There has been an increasing trend in which local airports have established their own noise policies, like banning flights by noisy aircraft, especially at night. The new law would seek a uniform Federal policy, one that would also encourage better planning by local officials of land use around airports.
The Secretary of Transportation, Samuel K. Skinner, who has called for both a national noise policy and a system of local passenger fees, was actively involved in negotiations with the Mr. Ford and Mr. Oberstar by telephone all afternoon.
At the end of the day, Mr. Skinner said that passage of the compromise would accomplish his most important objectives for aviation in the current legislative session.
 
Dealing With 3 Major Issues
 "It is the most comprehensive piece of aviation legislation since deregulation," he said. "It deals with three very prominent issues: capacity and congestion and environmental noise."
Among the interested parties that have lobbied all sides frenetically since last weekend are the airlines, which will have to spend billions of dollars to comply with any new noise regulations; the nation's biggest airports, which will be able to borrow billions of dollars on the strength of expected collections of fees from passengers; and residents of communities surrounding the airports, who wanted the Federal noise limits in the law to be as tough as possible, because local communities would have a hard time imposing tougher ones under the new law.
As important as the noise provisions, and likely to be noticed by passengers before quieter air traffic is noticed in communities near airports, are the new provisions for local airport fees.
 
$1 Billion for Airports
 Mr. Skinner said the availability of those fees "puts over a billion dollars a year into enhancing capacity and airports all over the country."
During the negotiations, Senator Ford accepted the House's formulas for how the passenger fees would be imposed. The fees, of up to $3 at any given airport, could amount to up to $12 on a round-trip ticket if the trip involved connections along the way. The charge would appear on the passenger's ticket, and the money would be controlled by the local airport, not the Federal Government.
Partly because airline passengers already pay a Federal ticket tax of 8 percent, which would be increased to 10 percent under the new budget proposals, local communities in the past have been prohibited from raising money from travelers.
The most difficult part of the negotiations dealt with how to phase in the replacement of noisier planes that are now in service. The agreement says that these planes must be replaced with new, quieter jets on a schedule that will retire at least 85 percent of them by July 1999, and the rest of them a few years later.
Airlines with financial problems will be given the most leeway in how quickly to replace their fleets.
Mr. Oberstar said that of the nation's commercial fleet of 4,800 airliners, some 2,350 are the noisier variety, known as Stage 2 because they replaced even louder planes in the 1970's. About half these will be replaced by quieter Stage 3 aircraft by the end of the 1990's he said.
 
Quieter Craft On Order
 He estimated that the nation's airlines had already ordered $150 billion worth of Stage 3 airplanes, and would order another $50 billion. One purpose of the law is to assure that the airlines do not face new local restrictions on these quieter aircraft after they are bought.
The Transportation Department estimated today that despite the high cost of new airplanes, the economic burden on the industry would be slight, because many planes could be fitted with "hush kits," at an estimated total cost of $870 million. Based on current travel projections, the department said, the cost of those modifications per passenger during the 1990's would amount to less than 25 cents.
The department estimated that three million people now live in areas around airports where noise is a serious problem. It said this number could be reduced to about one million by the year 2000.
Foreign airliners will be required to meet the same noise standards as American aircraft when flying in the United States.
"We have done a pretty decent job," said Mr. Ford, who took the first step in working out the compromise when the Senate Commerce Committee's aviation subcommittee, of which he is chairman, drafted the broad outlines of the bill and persuaded the full Senate to attach it to the budget bill with very little debate a week ago.

HEADLINE: Dime Posts Loss and Halts Payout

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Dime Savings Bank, one of New York City's most active mortgage lenders in the late 1980's, said yesterday that rising losses on residential real estate loans had led to a loss of $153.6 million in the third quarter and prompted the company to suspend its common stock dividend.
"I am fairly pessimistic about a rebound or recovery for the local economy in the near term," said Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of Dime. As real estate prices fall, he said, the bank suffers larger-than-expected losses when it sells houses and cooperative apartments acquired through foreclosure. 
 The loss in the quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of $2.1 million, or 9 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter of last year.
Dime's stock fell $1.25 yesterday, or 32 percent, to $2.625 a share. It was the third-largest percentage loser on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Real Estate Investors Default
 Most of Dime's foreclosures have been on one-to-four-family houses and cooperative apartments with mortgages made in 1987 and 1988 when real estate prices were peaking, Mr. Parsons said. Foreclosures have been most common, he said, on properties that were not occupied by their owners but were bought by individuals or partnerships who expected to sell them at a profit.
From 1986 to 1989, Dime made $12 billion of residential mortgage loans in New York, many of them "low-documentation" loans, in which the bank, for competitive reasons, asked buyers for less information about their income and financial condition than banks normally required.
"Dime was a very aggressive competitor, and now they are paying for it," said Peter Treadway, a banking analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham. Because Dime's business is heavily concentrated in the New York area, Mr. Treadway said that it is vulnerable to the ill effects of job cuts by banks and securities firms and the increases in city taxes that have squeezed some homeowners.
Some of Dime's efforts to diversify turned out to be badly timed. Its mortgages in Massachusetts, which accounted for a large part of a $110 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1989, are still causing problems.
Because of rising losses on foreclosed properties, and an increase in delinquent or seriously troubled loans to $857.2 million, from $754 million at mid-year, Dime set aside $167.9 million in a reserve in the third quarter to cover possible losses. About $45.2 million of that amount was for commercial and multi-family real estate and $121.4 million was for loans on co-op apartments and one-to-four-family houses.
Mr. Parsons said that he expected Dime to become profitable again in the fourth quarter but that it would not stop preparing for difficult times. "This is not a time when we should be doing anything other than husbanding our capital," he said.
Dime's capital was cut by a $92.3 million loss in 1989 and will be further reduced by the loss that is certain for all of 1990.
To conserve the $497.5 million of shareholders' capital, which serves as a cushion to absorb future losses, Dime suspended its quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share. Although the institution is in compliance with capital standards set by regulators, Mr. Parsons said he was planning other steps to strengthen Dime's financial condition by reducing its size and cutting expenses. One option, he said, is the sale of some of its 50 offices in New York and 8 in New Jersey.
Before the announcement yesterday, Dime had cut its staff to 2,600, from 3,600, closed all sales offices outside the New York area, and it had adopted tougher loan standards for potential home buyers.

HEADLINE: Default Fears Depress Bank Stocks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Banking companies continue to be mauled in the financial markets as investors worry about rising losses from real estate lending and the growing risk of defaults on other loans.
Five of the 10 most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday were banking companies, and all of them declined. Some of the sharpest drops were for California banks, as some analysts warned that losses on real estate loans in that state will soon begin to rise. 
 At Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, investors continued to demand high dividend rates for variable-rate preferred issues. Preferred stock with a 49-day maturity sold yesterday at 12 percent, down slightly from the 12.5 percent of Wednesday. Citicorp's common stock also fared poorly, falling 50 cents a share, to $11.125, a low for the year.
 
 Manufacturers Drops the Most
The sharpest decline among bank stocks was for the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corporation, whose stock fell $3 a share, or nearly 18 percent, to $17.
At a meeting with analsyts on Thursday, Peter J. Tobin, the company's chief financial officer, refused to rule out the possibility that the company's common stock dividend might be reduced -- an action widely predicted for weeks. Mr. Tobin said Manufacturers' financial condition was not deteriorating, but noted that the economy was fragile enough to raise questions about the bank's future prospects.
Among California banks, the Security Pacific Corporation's shares fell $1.625 each, to $18.625, and Wells Fargo & Company's stock fell $3.625, to $47.875. First Interstate Bancorp's stock dropped $1.375, to $18.125, and BankAmerica Corporation lost $1.125, to $18.75.
At yesterday's re-marketing of Citicorp's variable-rate preferred stock, an official at Merrill Lynch Money Markets said high dividend rates were starting to attract new kinds of buyers. She said that instead of the corporate treasurers who usually buy variable-rate preferred because the dividend is 85 percent tax-exempt, many new buyers who did not benefit from the tax-exemption were attracted by the dividend rates, which are far higher than they could earn on alternative investments like commercial paper or certificates of deposit.
Merrill Lynch set dividend rates of 12 percent for investors who chose to hold the stock 49 days, and 9.25 percent for investors who chose a 7-day investment period. At the end of 7 or 49 days, investors have the option of accepting new rates for another 7 or 49 days, or selling their stock.
The dividend rates were set at levels that Merrill Lynch officials estimated would attract enough buyers for the more than $100 million of stock that was turned in for sale yesterday.
While Citicorp's 12 percent rate for the 49-day preferred was down from Wednesday, it was far higher than the 6.13 percent paid yesterday by General Electric Capital or the 6.24 percent paid by Ford Holdings, a unit of the Ford Motor Company.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
U.S. Deficit for 1990 Surged to Near-Record $220.4 Billion, but How Bad Is That?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Closing the books on 1990, the Treasury Department made it official yesterday: the budget deficit, after dwindling to manageable proportions in the late 1980's, surged to a near-record $220.4 billion in the last fiscal year.
But while the prospect of $200-billion-plus deficits is scaring Congress and the White House into working out a record deficit-reduction package, economists say the huge number suggests more damage to the economy and to the well-being of Americans than has actually occurred. 
 They argue, for example, that the deficit is temporarily overstated because of the savings and loan bailout. What's more, they say, the deficit is still manageable; in fact, not much more of a burden than a $3,000 a month mortgage is to a family earning $85,000 a month. The problem is that the deficit, the mortgage, is rising, and the national income isn't.
Or, as David A. Stockman, former President Ronald Reagan's first budget chief, put it, "The deficit does not cause short-run domestic catastrophy, but over a long enough time it is poison."
 
Trend of Rising Deficits
 The announcement yesterday underscored the trend of a rising deficit in a period of stagnant income. While the $220.4 billion in 1990 barely missed the record of $221.2 billion in 1986, that high-water mark almost certainly will not survive another year.
Even if the budget proposals now before Congress are approved, the deficit for 1991, the current fiscal year, will be at least $250 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. And this at a time when the national income, the Gross National Product, is barely growing because of the weak economy. The G.N.P. is running at about $5.4 trillion this year.
That makes the deficit equal to 4 percent of the G.N.P., roughly the annual average for the 1980's, but well below the 2 percent or less that prevailed from 1950 until 1975, when the deficit suddenly shot up to 3.5 percent of G.N.P. and became a national issue.
Many economists applaud the efforts of Congress and the White House to work out a budget accord that would reduce the deficit by $500 billion, with the goal of once again making it a shrinking percentage of G.N.P. But some economists, like Robert Heilbroner, the economics historian, or Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache, question whether the day of reckoning will ever arrive.
 
A Skeptical Economist
 "We really don't know how to measure the deficit," Mr. Heilbroner said. "The numbers by themselves don't tell the story and in a world economy, to separate the American balance sheet no longer really works."
The numbers released by the Treasury Department yesterday underscore some of the difficulties. After the deficit fell to $152 billion in 1989, several factors reversed the trend, making the deficit rise by a whopping 45 percent in a single year.
At the head of this list of factors that continue to swell the deficit in 1991, are the weak economy and the savings and loan bailout.
The weak economy held down corporate profits and household incomes, reducing total tax receipts to $1.032 trillion. That was $30 billion less than the Bush Administration had expected to collect, according to Sidney Jones, an Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the Treasury Department.
Tax revenues, however, always fall and the deficit rises in periods of economic weakness. In the 1981-1982 recession, the deficit nearly doubled, to 4.1 percent of G.N.P. The problem is that after the 1981-82 recession, four years of robust economic growth passed before the deficit finally again subsided to less than 4 percent of G.N.P.
 
Advent of Huge Expenses
 In the 1950's and 1960's, the Government balance sheet shook off the effects of a recession in only months. But that changed with the 1974-1975 recession. The advent of Medicare and huge increases in Social Security and other entitlement programs more than tripled the deficit as a percentage of G.N.P. in 1975 and it did not subside to a more standard level for nearly four years.
The savings and loan bailout is also becoming a major long-term Federal expense, costing the Government in 1990 $58.1 billion, or 4.6 percent of total outlays of $1.252 trillion, to reimburse people whose bank deposits had disappeared in thrift institutions that failed. Economists argue that rather than being a true expense swelling the deficit, the $58.1 billion is a bookkeeping item -- temporarily borrowing or transferring money from the savings accounts of some Americans to replenish the accounts of others.
Mr. Stockman and others argue that there will be a loss from the bailout some day. The deposits the Government had to replenish were used to finance the construction of white elephant hotels and other ventures that today fail to earn an adequate return on the investment, if they earn anything at all.
The real loss in 1990, then, will not be the $58.1 billion announced yesterday, but only the $4 billion to $6 billion a year that might have been generated if the $58.1 billion had been invested in successful ventures. "There are all sorts of estimates," Mr. Stockman said, "but we don't know yet what the true loss will be from the ill-conceived ventures of the thrifts."
For this reason, some economists would reduce the deficit by the amount of the thrift bailout, in calculating the impact on the economy. In 1990, that would leave a net deficit of $162 billion, which represents a less alarming 3 percent of G.N.P., although in the view of Mr. Jones at Treasury, it is still too much.
"That is why some of us, zealots, believe we have to do something about the deficit," he said.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS: Not a Big Tilt In Tax Policy;
Plan Doesn't Revive The Era of Loopholes

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
On first glance, the income tax changes cobbled together in Washington seem an ungainly mix of partly concealed rate increases and new fiddles for the wealthy -- a return to the old days when the only real issue in tax policy was who got soaked, and a thousand and one tax shelters made a mockery of the progressive tax system.
Certainly the language of the debate fit the mold, as Democrats took every opportunity to tar President Bush as a defender of the privileged, and everybody gave short shrift to questions of how tax changes would affect productivity and growth. But surprisingly, that is not the way some tax experts see the result. 
of simplicity, efficiency and equity," said Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat who was the principal architect of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 but who apparently was shut out of the latest negotiations because his colleagues consider him too straight to deal. In Senator Bradley's view, the balance struck in the 1986 tax act has survived largely intact.
 
 Of Brackets and 'Bubbles'
 A gap between taxes on capital gains and other sources of income has indeed been reopened, allowing a little oxygen to permeate the comatose tax shelter industry. And upper-middle-income families will indeed be enveloped in yet another tax "bubble," raising their marginal bracket above the level of the truly rich.
But the resulting economic distortions are not likely to be large, experts say. And the scheduled increase in the alternative minimum tax -- what Joseph Minarik, a senior staff member on the Joint Economic Committee, not so affectionately calls the tax code's "spare tire" -- will make it more difficult for the wealthy to exploit tax gimmicks, new or old.
Rudolph G. Penner, an economist at the Urban Institute, said the thrust of tax changes in the 1980's was to "broaden the definition of income as much as possible in order to lower the tax rate as much as possible." The idea was to collect sufficient revenue to pay for the Government, but to collect it in a way that equalized the burden on families with similar incomes while having the least possible impact on incentives to work, save and invest.
 
 A Bare-Bones Approach
 Pure reforms, like the one proposed in 1983 by Robert Hall of Stanford University and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution, would have cut the maximum bracket below 20 percent by disallowing deductions for everything from home mortgage interest to fringe benefits to state tax payments. The Hall-Rabushka rules were so simple that the tax form would have fit on a postcard.
The bill actually shepherded through Congress in 1986 by Senator Bradley and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, was far from pure. Many forms of untaxed income, everything from employee fringe benefits to mortgage-financed housing, remained untaxed. And the revised tax system was hardly simple: those who used the remaining tax preferences spent more time than ever documenting expenses and filling out forms.
But the law was widely regarded as a triumph for tax reform because it did broaden the tax base sufficiently to cut the maximum tax on an extra dollar of income from 50 percent to 33 percent. Moreover, by eliminating the lower rate on capital gains, it reduced a notable source of distortion in investment decisions.
 
 Some Confusion Expected
 The deal struck this week will raise the maximum tax bracket for a family of four by just one percentage point. But because of what Emil Sunley of Deloitte & Touche calls President Bush's "penchant for subterfuge," it will do so in a way that many are likely to find both confusing and unfair.
Under pressure to take a whack at wealthy families who got the lion's share of benefits from the big tax cut of 1981, Congress insisted on raising the top tax rate. But the highest nominal rate President Bush would accept was 31 percent. To raise more revenue at the expense of the affluent, negotiators agreed to limit itemized deductions for families earning more than $100,000 and to phase out personal exemptions for families earning between $150,000 and $275,000.
The itemized-deduction limit is roughly equivalent to a one percentage point surcharge, raising the effective maximum income tax rate to 32 percent. The exemption phase-out offered by the negotiators (but apparently still subject to modification) is equivalent to an extra half-percentage point for each family member -- three percentage points for a family of six. Uncle Sam will thus take roughly 35 cents of the last dollar earned by a family of six reporting an income of, say, $175,000, and just 32 cents of the last dollar earned by a family of six with an income of $400,000.
 
 Assessing the Effects
 The incorporation of this new bubble in marginal tax rates has been widely interpreted as a defeat for tax rationality. But Senator Bradley is not so sure.
Bubbles may be awkward artifacts of a complicated tax system, he argues, but their intent and impact are often benign. The working poor who are eligible for the earned income tax credit, he notes, currently pay 25 cents in tax for every extra dollar earned, while those who are slightly better off pay just 15 percent.
This new bubble, by comparison, opens a gap of just three percentage points in marginal rates -- too little, in the view of most tax analysts, to affect economic incentives very much.
Nor, Senator Bradley argues, does the new bubble do much violence to the equity of the tax system. Large wealthy families will end up paying a bit more tax than small wealthy families with the same income. But the bubble will not interfere with the progressivity of the income tax: the higher a family's income, the higher the percentage of income it will pay out. No taxpayer, moreover, will end up paying more than 31 percent of earnings in income tax.
 
 Worries About a Precedent
 Fans of the 1986 tax changes are less sanguine about the new 28 percent maximum tax rate on capital gains. They fear this concession to President Bush is the nose under the camel's tent -- an invitation to come back next year or the next with a bid for a still lower rate. But they worry less about the plan than the precedent.
For the very richest taxpayers -- the ones who in the past made greatest use of the capital gains preference -- the new capital gains rate will be only three percentage points lower than the marginal rate on other income. And that seems a modest rock on which to build new tax shelters. "A differential this small," Mr. Penner concluded, "shouldn't distort incentives very much."
The negotiators added tax breaks for small insurance companies, energy producers and developers of low-income housing -- breaks that amount to backsliding from the 1986 law. But negotiators also raised the alternative minimum tax to 23 percent, from 21 percent, making it more difficult than ever for the wealthy to use personal deductions to lower their tax burdens below that of the middle class.
On balance, experts believe, it will probably be harder for high-income families to avoid taxation: preliminary Government estimates show that Americans earning more than $200,000 will on average pay about 6 percent more tax, while those with incomes of $20,000 to $200,000 will see their taxes rise about 2 percent.
The resulting redistribution of tax burdens, Mr. Minarik notes, only partly offsets the tilt created by the 1981 tax cuts. But the fact that the negotiators were able to make the tax system more progressive -- as the public apparently wanted -- without significantly undermining its efficiency surely must count as a modest triumph for the spirit of tax reform.

HEADLINE: Loss Shown By Cummins In 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Cummins Engine Company, citing a sharp decline in demand for its truck engines, said yesterday that it had a third-quarter loss of $33.7 million, compared with a loss of $39.7 million in the corresponding quarter last year.
Cummins, the largest independent maker of diesel engines in the world, said that it expected no improvement in the North American heavy-truck market anytime soon and that it planned to continue to reduce its work force. Painting a grim picture of the future, the company said that truck sales could decline by up to 10 percent next year. 
 Cummins, which is based in Columbus, Ind., seemed poised for a turnaround this year after two years of consecutive losses. But the company said yesterday that it expected a loss in the fourth quarter also, and analysts said the company was likely to lose more than $50 million this year.
 
 Sales Up by 2.8 Percent
 Sales in the third quarter were up by 2.8 percent, to $829.8 million from $807.3 million.
Faced with slumping demand, the company said it planned to trim expenses, causing some analysts to wonder if Cummins would be forced to cut its quarterly dividend of 55 cents to save money. Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said that "one has to realize that the current payout ratio is suspect." However, Ann C. Smith, a Cummins spokewoman, said that "the company has no plans to adjust the dividend."
The company's stock fell $1.125 yesterday, to $37.125 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Cummins earnings report for the quarter ended Sept. 30 included a one-time $22.1 million gain resulting from the repurchase of debt. The company also set aside $18.2 million for the cost of repairing products under its extended warranty program.
In response to weak demand for truck engines, its main product, Cummins is cutting costs and capital spending. In recent months, the company has reduced its worldwide work force by 300 employees. The company said yesterday that it was cutting 210 production jobs in the Columbus area and that additional layoffs were expected in coming months. The company has 25,000 employees.
Cummins recently reduced its Columbus engine assembly plant to one shift and analysts said the plant was running at 50 percent of capacity.
 
Improvement in 1991 Seen
 Steven J. Colbert, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, said, "I think that they are going to have to do more to cut costs." Cummins told analysts in a conference call that it planned to break even or make a profit in 1991, despite its projection of a continued softening of the truck market.
Analysts agree that it will be difficult for Cummins to achieve profitability in the difficult economic climate. Mr. Lustgarten of Paine Webber said, "It is going to be a real challenge for the company to make money next year."
In July, Cummins, which has fought off two takeover attempts in recent years, sold a 27 percent stake to three friendly investors, the Ford Motor Company, Tenneco Inc. and the Kubota Corporation.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Hoards His $5 Million Fund

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
After spending $1 million on campaign advertising in the last month, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo still has $5 million available for the last two weeks of his re-election campaign -- and any future campaigns, according to campaign financial reports filed yesterday with the State Board of Elections.
But none of the Cuomo money went to the hard-pressed Democratic candidates for the State Senate, who are borrowing money for the final stages of their effort to win control of the upper house of the Legislature, a campaign in which they have been outspent by the State Senate Republican Campaign Committee by at least 4 to 1. 
 Mr. Cuomo has argued that it would be breaking faith with his contributors to divert his campaign money.
In contrast, the Democratic state committee reported spending $213,000 for postage, polls, advertising and literature, mostly for the State Senate candidates.
Any excess Cuomo funds that fall within the $1,000-per-donor Federal limit on contributions could be used in a Presidential campaign.
The Democratic state chairman, John A. Marino, said an earlier $400,000 transfer from the Cuomo committee for "get out the vote" mailings would "indirectly benefit" the party's State Senate candidates, as well as other Democrats.
 
Abrams Borrows
 For other candidates, fund-raising efforts were considerably more difficult. Attorney General Robert Abrams, one of the top fund-raisers in the state, borrowed $250,000 to maintain his $1.1 million television campaign. He has raised about $1.6 million, well short of the $2.5 million goal he had set.
Mr. Cuomo's Republican opponent, Pierre A. Rinfret, was able to raise only $135,255 in the last three weeks, despite his pressure on Republican county organizations to donate and an unusual 900 telephone number to raise money, in which $3 of each $5 call goes to the Rinfret campaign.
Mr. Rinfret reported $239,307 in unpaid bills, which he said earlier this week he believed he was "morally obligated" to pay himself, although candidates often hide behind their committees and disclaim responsibility for campaign bills.
Herbert London, the Conservative candidate, trailed behind Mr. Rinfret, and although his contributions picked up slightly to $66,1365 in the last three weeks for a total of $182,070, and he did not receive the major infusion of conservative Republican money for which he had hoped.
Politicians in both parties attributed the fund-raising difficulties to a depressed economy and the lack of competitive statewide races except one, the campaign for state comptroller.
 
From Shepherd to Poodle
 In that contest, the Democratic challenger, Carol Bellamy, was competitive in fund-raising with the Republican incumbent, Edward V. Regan. But neither has raised $1 million yet, although their original goals were $2.5 million each.
Ms. Bellamy actually had more cash available for the final push to Election Day and was using it in her first television advertising that attacked her opponent directly, in a commercial using four dogs to depict Mr. Regan's watchdog role.
The commercial starts by showing a German shepherd as watchdog and ends by showing a poodle.
The message was to question whether Mr. Regan was an effective watchdog and to highlight criticism of his fund-raising tactics by the State Government Integrity Commission.
Mr. Regan's media adviser, Maureen R. Connelly, said she was not impressed.
"It looked like a dog food commercial," said Ms. Connelly, adding that Ms. Bellamy "is barking up the wrong tree."

HEADLINE: Daily News: The Combatants

 BODY:

Michael J. Alvino
President, Deliverers Union
 Michael J. Alvi no, 54 years old, the president of the 700-member Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union, is not happy about the walkout at The Daily News. "I needed a strike this weekend like a hole in the head," he said the other day. Mr. Alvino has a specific reason, a family wedding in Maine. But his irritation expresses the sentiments of most of the employees at The News who are now out of work.
"This is New York City," Mr. Alvino said. "It's a union town -- and The Daily News right now is attacking our union, bringing in these hired guns from out of town to take jobs away from my men."
Mr. Alvino, who has been president of the drivers union for 16 months, has a reputation for outspokenness. Testifying under immunity at the Federal trial of one of his predecessors, Douglas LaChance, Mr. Alvino readily acknowledged being a conduit for payoffs to Mr. LaChance from News wholesalers who wanted to lay off drivers. Mr. LaChance, the union's president during the 1978 newspaper strike, later was imprisoned for corruption.
But it was Mr. Alvino who brought the drivers into the Allied Printing Trades Council, and the drivers are generally acknowledged to be the most powerful of the 10 unions now battling The Daily News.
 
Charles T. Brumback
President, Tribune Company
 Charles T. Brum back, president and chief execu tive of the Trib une Company, which owns The Daily News in New York and The Chicago Tribune, is an ac countant by training who shuns the spotlight and who made his mark in the Tribune organization as a cost cutter, a decisive manager and a tough man on unions.
"Union leaders vilify him. Newspaper analysts lionize him. Shareholders are going to love him," said a profile in Crain's Chicago Business magazine just before Mr. Brumback, 62 years old, added the title of chief executive on Aug. 1, taking over from Stanton R. Cook, who remains chairman of the Chicago-based company.
Mr. Brumback, who graduated from Princeton in 1950, won a Bronze Star as an Army lieutenant in infantry fighting in Korea. Returning to his hometown of Toledo, Ohio, he studied accounting in graduate school at the University of Toledo while working for Arthur Young & Company. In 1957, he took a job as controller for the Star Sentinel Company in Orlando, Fla. The Tribune Company purchased the newspaper in 1965.
Mr. Brumback turned the Orlando paper into a money maker and caught the eye of Chicago headquarters. He was named chief executive of the Florida company in 1976 and in 1981 was brought to Chicago as head of The Chicago Tribune.
Mr. Brumback succeeded in breaking three unions at The Tribune in a 1985 strike of pressmen, printers and mailers. He was named president of the parent company on Jan. 1, 1989.
 
James Hoge
Publisher, Daily News
 James Hoge, 54 years old, be came publisher of The Daily News in 1984 after a mercurial career in Chicago journalism in which he became city editor of The Chicago Sun-Times at 29, managing editor at 31 and publisher at 44.
He came to The News two years after its parent company, the Tribune Company of Chicago, had nearly closed it and has presided over six years of continuing economic difficulty.
Last year he signaled the newspaper's new tough stance toward its unions by retaining the Nashville law firm of King & Ballow to represent it in talks that Mr. Hoge said could determine the survival of the paper. The law firm has frequently been used by companies looking to break unions or vastly renegotiate their contracts with them.
He called for renegotiations with the paper's 10 unions that would dramatically revamp work rules and overhaul salaries, benefits and other compensation so that the company could save what has been estimated as more than $100 million annually.
Mr. Hoge grew up on Park Avenue and was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale. He is married to Sharon King Hoge, a former television consumer reporter, and has three children from an earlier marriage. His brother Warren is an assistant managing editor of The Times.
He has been quoted as saying, "I want to be the man who has on his epitaph that he saved The Daily News."
 
Barry F. Lipton
President, Newspaper Guild
 Barry F. Lipton, president of the Newspaper Guild of New York since 1985, rose to power during a period of bitter factionalism and financial difficulties within the union. He was renominated on Thursday night for another two-year term.
Previously an advertising salesman for The New York Times, Mr. Lipton became active in the union as a grievance officer. In 1982, he was elected to the full-time post of secretary-treasurer, which led to the presidency. Mr. Lipton, 48 years old, is separated and has one son, and lives in East Hills, L.I.
His local has about 5,500 members working at 33 newspapers and magazines in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The guild's jurisdiction is broad, covering most white-collar jobs, including those in the news, advertising, circulation and business departments.
Mr. Lipton has encouraged cooperation with leaders of unions in the industry that represent various production and delivery departments. Relations between such unions in the past were sometimes characterized by rivalry, at times including crossing each other's picket lines.

HEADLINE: Turning Profits Hand Over Wrist

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Social scientists have long puzzled over fads, those brief, extraordinarily popular obsessions with peculiar objects and clothing. They have pondered their causes in late 20th-century America and their meaning for Western civilization.
But Tara Murtha is not puzzled. The 10-year-old likes the latest fad because it lets her do a neat trick with her big toe. 
 Her father, Eugene Murtha, is behind the latest craze among the schoolyard set. As president of the Main Street Toy Company, he makes and markets Slap Wraps, a long, thin piece of fabric-covered steel that curves into a bracelet when slapped around the wrist or ankle. It is basically a Venetian blind with an attitude. In the last three months alone, Main Street Toy has sold more than a million Slap Wraps, all of them by word of mouth.
 
 Short-Lived Craze Expected
 Like other crazes in the toy business, slap bracelets are almost certainly doomed to a short life. But Main Street Toy, based in Simsbury, Conn., is led by experienced executives from Coleco Industries, the marketer of Cabbage Patch dolls, which is now bankrupt. They say they learned lessons from Coleco's mistakes about managing windfall profits from selling to 10-year-olds, like keeping corporate overhead lean. Meanwhile, they ride the rocket.
Last November, when her father showed her a prototype Slap Wrap, Tara went crazy over it, endlessly snapping it around her wrist. Her coolest trick was to balance one on her big toe, flip it into the air, and let it fall onto her ankle with a giggle-provoking snap.
Under the perplexed gaze of adults, millions of Taras are slapping the metal slats on their limbs. Main Street says it has orders for five million of the bracelets, which sell for about $1.30 wholesale, or about $2.50 retail in Toys "R" Us, Kay Bees and other toy stores.
And like other companies with a hot toy, Main Street has found itself watching helplessly as competitors cash in on the frenzy. Main Street estimates that other companies have sold another 10 million to 15 million cheap and sometimes shoddy imitations for as little as 70 cents each. Some Federal and state regulators, schools and parents have acted to stem the tide of the bracelets, concentrating on the knockoffs, which have been blamed for causing some minor injuries to children.
Main Street, whose sales may have benefited from negative publicity about the imitators, says it is planning legal action against the competitors for trademark infringement.
Although in business just two years, Main Street Toy knows a lot about the vagaries of the toy field. The 10-person company is led by five refugees from Coleco, once based in nearby West Hartford, Conn. At its peak in 1985, Coleco had sales of $776 million, mostly from Cabbage Patch dolls and an ill-fated personal computer called Adam. Coleco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1988 after children started relegating its products to the toy graveyard next to Hula Hoops and Teddy Ruxpin.
Main Street was founded by Mr. Murtha, 39, a former vice president for marketing at Coleco, where he helped sell the games Scrabble, Parcheesi and Trivial Pursuit -- products that Coleco had obtained through its purchase of Selchow & Righter. He also held senior positions at toy companies like Fisher-Price, the General Mills toy group and Milton Bradley. He recruited to his fledgling concern senior Coleco officials with skills in order processing, accounting and marketing.
"Slap Wraps is interesting because it shows how conservative the toy business has become," said Larry Carlat, editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine, a trade publication. Large toy companies, he explained, had turned down the product, which a small company was able to market successfully.
Mr. Murtha knew the slap bracelets would be the latest rage. "Big numbers was what I was thinking," he said. "It would make a perfect counter-seasonal product with multiple-purchase possibilities," meaning that a lot of people would buy a lot of Slap Wraps at times other than Christmas.
 
 Cheapest Craze Since Pet Rocks
 So far he's been right. Slap Wraps is the biggest cheap-novelty craze since Pet Rocks in the late Paleozoic Era, circa 1975, Mr. Carlat said.
Of course, Slap Wraps at perhaps $15 million in retail sales this year will not come close to Barbie dolls (about $680 million annually) or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (perhaps $1 billion for all merchandise). But slap bracelets only cost $2.50 -- a cheap chotchke for recession-haunted times.
Orders are pouring in so fast that Main Street has stopped counting them -- it simply weighs them, about 30 pounds a day. The company might post 1990 revenue of $6 million to $8 million compared with $2.5 million last year.
Main Street plans to come out with new lines of Slap Wraps, covered with cartoon characters and Valentine's Day greetings, for example. But for the moment, it wants to put a brake on expanding corporate overhead. "If we need to hire two people, we'll only hire one," Mr. Murtha said.
 
 Invented by Shop Teacher
 Slap Wraps was invented by Stuart Anders, a high-school shop teacher from Sun Prairie, Wis. In 1983, he was fiddling around with steel ribbons in his father's shop when he invented what would eventually become Slap Wraps.
By chance, he showed his invention to Philip Bart, an agent who represented toy inventors. Last November, when Mr. Bart got in touch with Mr. Murtha, the three men formed affiliated companies.
Mr. Murtha had hundreds of prototypes made for the Toy Fair held in February in New York, the industry convention where manufacturers sell wares to distributors and retailers.
Rival companies, seeing Slap Wraps at Toy Fair, saw their potential, too. Mr. Murtha was not worried then because Main Street expected to have its version out on the market as early as April. But the company did not introduce Slap Wraps until July.
 
 Safety in Gauge of Steel
 When Main Street started testing the product to conform with Federal safety regulations, it discovered that the steel could break and slice through the fabric, exposing sharp metal edges. By making Slap Wraps out of thicker gauge steel -- 0.006 inch thick, instead of the prototype's 0.004 inch -- it was less likely to break.
Introduction was postponed while the company developed a safer product and awaited shipments from its Hong Kong factory.
Meanwhile, competitors were able to bring out similar products at the same time as Main Street because they had copied the thin-steel prototype. Millions of knockoffs, made in Taiwan, flooded the Northeast.
 
 Injury to a 4-Year-Old
 In Wallingford, Conn., earlier this month, 4-year-old Nicole Tomaso was playing with a cheap knockoff when she ran screaming into the family living room. An exposed edge had cut her finger and nail.
Outraged, her father, Joseph N. Tomaso, filed a complaint with Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection, which began an investigation. The agency is now asking Connecticut retailers to recall the imitations and has alerted its state counterparts, as well as the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, about the knockoffs' dangers. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Minnesota are contemplating action.
Mr. Anders, the inventor, is fatalistic about his product's future. "I'd like to think Slap Wraps will last 30 years," he said, "but I know it won't. I hope to be somewhere between Pet Rocks and the Hula Hoop."

HEADLINE: Macy Says It Might Sell Sizable Stake to Trim Debt

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
R. H. Macy & Company told its investors yesterday that it might sell a more substantial stake in the debt-laden company than it had previously sold to other investors. Some speculation centered on a Hong Kong company as a possible buyer.
In a quarterly letter to investors in Macy's 1986 leveraged buyout, top management did not identify a potential buyer. The company did not say whether it was already negotiating with one buyer or was still exploring the field. But a Macy spokeswoman said, "This is not a veiled reference to a specific buyer, but it is stronger than merely exploring the possibility." 
 Macy said in its letter: "The buyer would be one who shares our view of Macy's value and future. We believe such a sale would be in the company's best interests as it will allow us to make a major reduction in our interest costs."
In the 1986 buyout, Macy took on $5.6 billion in debt, and the interest on that debt has put a severe strain on the company's finances with the slump in retailing.
Executives in mergers and acquisitions said that in view of the current difficult times in American retailing, it was likely that a buyer would be a foreign company. Among the possible buyers mentioned was Wharf Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong shipping and real estate concern. Myron E. Ullman 2d, Macy's executive vice president since November 1988, is a former managing director and chief operating officer of Wharf. But the Macy spokeswoman said the company had no comment on the reports that it was negotiating with Wharf.
Efforts to reach Wharf by telephone last night were unsuccessful.
"It's obvious that Macy's will need a large equity infusion to pay interest on its debt principal and for working capital," said Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo Inc., a mergers and acquisitions specialist in New York. "I would estimate such an infusion would be at least $200 million to $300 million and perhaps even more."
Earlier asset sales by Macy have been relatively small ones, including the sale of 1 percent equity to buy $50 million of Macy high-yield bonds; a proposed sale of the former Bullock's office building in Los Angeles, with the proceeds going to reduce senior debt, and a sale of Macy's credit card finance subsidiaries, the Macy Credit Corporation and the Macy Receivables Funding Corporation.
Macy said it had reduced expenses in line with anticipated slower business conditions and also cut its inventory levels to $600 million less than they were a year earlier at retail.
While Macy said it expected the Christmas season to reflect the continued sluggish economic conditions, it also said the low level of inventories would prevent a "repetition of the heavy markdown activity of last fall."
Macy distributed its investor letter with the release of its financial statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended July 28. As previously reported, Macy had a much higher net loss in the recent year, totaling $215.3 million, against a net loss of $63 million the year before.
"Our fiscal 1990 performance was certainly not satisfactory," Macy said. But it added that its conservative approach had produced benefits. Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for the second half rose to $339 million from from $321 million in 1989. In the fourth quarter, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation increased to $179 million from $167 million.
Remuneration during the 1990 year for Macy's top executives was listed in the company's financial statement. Edward S. Finkelstein, chairman and chief executive, earned $1,134,149; Mark S. Handler, president and chief operating officer, $864,707, and Mr. Ullman, $519,886.

HEADLINE: 2,600 Jobs To Be Cut By Aetna

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The Aetna Life and Casualty Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 2,600 jobs as part of a program of broad changes. Coming on the heels of similar reports by other leading American insurers, the announcement is a sign of continuing problems in the industry.
The Hartford-based insurer said the move would save the company $50 million next year and more after that. The job reductions were announced along with the company's third-quarter earnings, which were down sharply. 
 Analysts praised the move as necessary although painful. They said it reflected a retrenchment across the industry after nearly two decades of rapid growth. Insurance companies have been experiencing some of the credit problems of banks and other financial institutions in the face of falling real estate values and a decline in high-yield "junk bond" portfolios.
 
 Decade of 'Retrenchment'
 "Other than the people losing their jobs, I think it's terrific," said A. Michael Frinquelli, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. "The decade of the 1990's will be one of retrenchment. The whole economy is going through that, and insurers, since they reflect the overall economy, are retrenching, too. This isn't just Aetna. It's a foregone conclusion industrywide."
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Aetna's shares gained 25 cents, to $31.
James T. Lynn, Aetna's chairman, said the move had been made "to best position the company for success in a rapidly changing marketplace. He added, "Our goal is to build on the many areas of excellence Aetna must retain, and to solidify our position as a leader in insurance, related financial services and managed health care."
Most of the job eliminations will come from Aetna's three Hartford-area offices. Essentially, the company is disbanding one layer of corporate management that consisted of three domestic divisions. These divisions will be replaced by a single corporate unit. The changes are effective March 4.
As part of the plan, the company announced a $90 million one-time pretax charge to cover the costs of severance, benefits and other costs of reorganization. This charge pushed down third-quarter earnings by 51.5 percent, to $88.6 million, or 80 cents a share, on revenues of $4.8 billion. In the 1989 third quarter the company earned $182.6 million, or $1.63 a share, on revenues of $4.9 billion. The 1989 performance, however, was aided by $42 million in one-time gains.
Aetna has 45,200 employees nationwide, with 17,400 in the Hartford area. Some of the jobs will be lost through attrition. But the company gave no specifics on the number of employees affected.
 
Others Trimming Also
 Similar changes have been taking place at the Travelers Corporation, also based in Hartford, and the Philadelphia-based Cigna Corporation announced recently that it would take a restructuring charge when it reported its third-quarter earnings. The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States is also pledged to a $100 million cost-cutting effort.
Aetna said yesterday that the retrenchment would provide after-tax savings of $50 million in 1991, $90 million in 1992 and $95 million a year after that.
"This is a good move," said G. Alan Zimmerman, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc. "It's imperative for the whole insurance industry and for corporate America to stay as lean as possible."
The industrywide moves are a reversal of the strategy of the 1970's and 1980's, when insurers grew quickly by writing policies and investing the proceeds in a broad array of new financial products. During that time, the industry grew to have more than $1.8 trillion in assets. But, as the economy has faltered, so has their business. Insurance company failures have been on the rise, and questions have been raised in Congress about the industry's solvency.
"What's going to happen in the 1990's is that the industry will focus on profits and not on size," said Mr. Frinquelli of Salomon Brothers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mixed Showing for Dollar; Gold Stumbles in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday in quiet trading on world currency markets amid some nervousness over the United States military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
Gold prices slipped overseas, and the decline accelerated in United States trading. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell $4.90, to $370.90 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted gold at $371, down $5.25. 
 Currency traders said there was occasional dollar-buying as some investors sought a haven in the United States currency ahead of an uncertain weekend in the Middle East. Adding to their concern was the disclosure on Thursday that the United States plans to send up to 100,000 more troops to the area.
"It appears, with the situation in the Persian Gulf very, very tense, that people wanted to buy back a few dollars," said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer with Barclays Bank. The dollar typically is considered the currency of choice in times of global turmoil.
But countering the advance was an underlying bearish sentiment toward the dollar based on the expectation of lower interest rates and a weakening economy. The market is anticipating that the Federal Reserve will act to lower interest rates once the deficit-reduction budget package proposed this week is enacted. Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
Michael Malpede, a senior analyst with Refco Group Ltd., characterized yesterday's trading as trendless. There was no commitment, he said, to either buying or selling dollars.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.35 yen, to a close at 128.50 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 128. In New York, the dollar settled at 128.25 yen, unchanged from Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9555, from $1.9545 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.9565 to buy a pound, up from $1.9505 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5130 German marks, down from 1.5185; 1.2810 Swiss francs, down from 1.2845; 5.0670 French francs, down from 5.0820; 1,134.00 Italian lire, down from 1,136.50, and 1.1644 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1657.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $373.75 an ounce, from $376.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal slipped to a closing bid of $373.40, from $374.80. Financial markets in Hong Kong were closed for a holiday.
Silver prices also declined. On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery settled at $4.050 an ounce, down from $4.204 on Thursday. Earlier in London, silver fell to a late bid of $4.14, from $4.24.

Alaska Air Group To Reduce Staff

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Alaska Air Group Inc. said it was reducing its management staff by 46 and leaving 39 other positions unfilled because of high jet fuel costs and a weakening economy. The cuts, effective Nov. 9, are expected to save about $3.3 million a year.
"Unfortunately, dramatic increases in jet fuel prices triggered this action,' said an official of Alaska Airlines, the company's main operating unit. He said no further reductions were expected. Alaska Airlines currently employs 6,500 people, including 980 managers. The company's stock fell 62.5 cents today, to $16.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Escalation, 1990 Style

 BODY:
Does it make military or political sense to add 100,000 or more American troops to the 210,000 already deployed in Saudi Arabia? Though the buildup announced by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney is unexpected, that does not mean it is imprudent. But if Americans are to support this new commitment, the Administration needs to explain its purposes and to allay fears that the collective forces in the Persian Gulf are becoming excessively Americanized.
The buildup may be essential to persuade Saddam Hussein that he has no choice but to withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally. But since Vietnam, Americans have been wary of escalation, and slippery official justifications for it. Pentagon analysts say that even 100,000 additional troops may not be enough, that more backup is required. As the risks and sacrifices swell, so will the pressure to initiate use of force soon, when the desert is cooler and dark nights favor surprise. 
 Administration officials insist there is no change in the declared strategy of multilateral collaboration to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Tough U.N. resolutions have imposed sanctions against Iraq that already seem to be producing results. This collective effort has prevented Saddam Hussein from defining the conflict as a U.S. vendetta inspired by a thirst for cheap oil. Increasing the U.S. component in the multilateral effort risks Americanizing the siege to his advantage.
Creditably, the Bush Administration seems alert to the danger and is finally taking up a Soviet proposal to upgrade the long-moribund U.N. Military Staff Committee. For the first time in memory, senior military officers representing the five permanent members of the Security Council will meet to discuss joint action.
Success, however, will require more than multinational unity. To nurture American understanding and support, the President needs to explain why more American troops must be deployed when there is no commensurate increase by European and Arab allies.
Saudi Arabia has 60,000 troops in the force. France has reportedly agreed to put its 13,000 under U.S. command. Britain has done the same with its 15,000 troops. Syria has pledged 19,000, Egypt 20,000. Other countries are sending detachments or ships. But so far, there's been not even a token military contribution from Germany or Japan.
No one can say for sure that war will be avoided, or that economic sanctions and the multinational force will induce Saddam Hussein to disgorge Kuwait. But the terrible cost in lives, and the risk of enduring Arab hatred of America, are powerful arguments for restraint. Impatience alone is no argument for initiating war. The burden is on President Bush to show that a significant increase in American forces will make less likely their use in battle.

HEADLINE: Teachers' Pay Raise Tests Our Commitment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Divisiveness during a time of increasing fiscal crisis in New York is unfortunate. Nevertheless, the controversy surrounding the 5.5 percent increase in the teachers' contract presents the city and state, the public, and business and civic leaders with the opportunity to make a clear and fundamental choice: What are truly our highest priorities? Where will we put our money? 
 All of us say that education is among the city's highest priorities and is the key to our long-term economic health. Indeed, all of us have cried out for better quality education for New York's young people. We have a dynamic new Chancellor who is beginning the process of change. We have a new Mayor who has clearly and ringingly stated his belief in children as the city's future.
No one doubts that a well-recruited, well-trained, motivated and dedicated teaching force is the key element in the strategy for educational improvement. None of us can be naive enough to think that simply a 5.5 percent increase will accomplish that end overnight. But when areas surrounding the city and districts all over the state that have higher entry salaries to start with are granting 8 percent increases and more, we must respond. If we don't try to be competitive, how can we expect to attract, retain and motivate the best available teachers?
The choice is clear: If we value education as much as we say we do, we must value teachers accordingly. But if education is not truly our top priority, then by all means let's rescind the teachers' contract and live with the consequences. If educational improvement is a top priority on the city's agenda, the contract must stand.

HEADLINE: And in Bergen, Add Anger at School-Aid Loss

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

DATELINE: HACKENSAC

 BODY:
THE $2.8 billion tax increase Gov. Jim Florio whipped through the Legislature in June has cast a long shadow over the contest for Bergen County executive.
The candidates, Jeremiah F. O'Connor, a Democrat, and William P. Schuber, a Republican, have scrambled for weeks to capitalize on the deep voter hostility to the taxes and the millions of dollars Bergen's schools will lose under the state's revised school-aid formula. In debates, television and radio ads, and fliers, each has extolled efficiency in government, trumpeted his own budgetcutting plan, and painted the other as having willingly raised taxes in the past. 
 These themes have dominated the campaign to run the $320 million government of the state's most populated county and detracted from talk about major issues facing the county in the 1990's.
On many of them, Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Schuber agree. Both favor open space and regionalization of municipal services like road repair, firefighting and public works. Both oppose construction of the $400 million incinerator for garbage from Bergen's 70 towns and the $1 billion tunnel proposed by the Army Corps of Engineers to divert flood waters from the Pompton and Passaic Rivers in Wayne to the lower Hackensack River and Newark Bay.
In recent interviews, their sharpest disagreement dealt with steps the county executive could take to ease the deep financial losses county schools face under the Governor's new Quality Education Act.
The law, enacted in late spring, shifts hundreds of millions in state education aid from the state's wealthiest districts to middle- class and poor districts. Bergen's schools will lose nearly $89 million in state aid from mid-1993 to mid-1996 and are required to pay another $97 million in teachers' pension and Social Security costs, starting next fall. These changes will mean deep cuts in education programs or sharply higher local property taxes, school superintendents say.
Mr. O'Connor testified against the new school-aid formula last spring before it was enacted. Only the Legislature can change it now, he said.
Mr. Schuber, a five-term State Assemblyman who voted against the formula, said: "The next executive has to work with the legislative delegation. It's incumbent to exercise leadership to get a better share for Bergen in school funding. We'll focus public attention on it."
By that, he said, he meant that as next fall's legislative elections approach, he will publicly challenge Bergen's Democrats in the Legislature to either side with the Governor and the new formula and its deep cuts or fight in Trenton for changes benefiting Bergen schools.
Seven of Bergen's 15 state legislators are Democrats and their votes were crucial to the passage of the higher taxes and the revised school-aid formula in June.
Politically, it would be a simple matter for Mr. Schuber, if elected executive, to campaign next year against those Democratic legislators who helped enact the taxes. To do the same, Mr. O'Connor would be forced to break ranks with fellow Democrats and jeopardize both their re-election to the Legislature and the slim majorities the Democrats now hold in the Assembly and Senate.
Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Schuber are vying to succeed Bergen's first Executive, William McDowell, a Republican, who is not seeking re-election. Mr. McDowell quietly guided the county over the last four years through a historic charter change and transition from a weak form of government overseen by a board of freeholders to a stronger, more centralized form run by an executive.
 
Re-Entry to Politics
 For Mr. O'Connor, long a power in Bergen's Democratic Party, the campaign is a re-entry to elective politics after a decade's absence. Now 57 years old, he served as a State Senator in 1966 and 1967, a freeholder from 1974 to 1980 and freeholder director from 1975 to 1979. Currently, he is vice chairman of the board of Interchange State Bank, a 12-branch chain with headquarters in Saddle Brook.
Mr. Schuber, a 43-year-old lawyer here, was first elected to the Assembly in 1981. He represents Bergen's 38th District, which includes the central Bergen communities of Bogota, his hometown; Hackensack; Paramus; Lodi, Maywood and Oradell. He was re-elected last year in a blitz of ticket-splitting that overcame a Florio landslide in the 38th District. Although Mr. Florio carried the district by about 13,000 votes, Mr. Schuber won his contest by nearly 5,000 votes.
He is trying to depict Mr. O'Connor as a big spender by saying Mr. O'Connor endorsed Mr. Florio's tax increases and oversaw an increase in county spending to $184 million from $84 million while freeholder director in the late 70's.
Mr. O'Connor cries distortion. On the tax issue, he said he endorsed the idea of raising the income tax for individuals earning more than $100,000 as an equitable way to cut the state budget deficit. As for the county spending record of the late 70's, he said much of the increase came from Federal grants. He argues he held county property tax increases below the inflation rate.
 
'Not Business as Usual'
 And, Mr. O'Connor says, Mr. Schuber voted for 21 different tax increases during Thomas H. Kean's two terms as Governor.
Both insist they are now against tax increases.
"Hard decisions will have to be made," Mr. Schuber said in an interview. "This is not business as usual. People have had it with spending and taxes."
Mr. O'Connor said: "The day of raising taxes is over. We have to keep spending under inflation."
 
Plans on Budget Cuts
 Mr. O'Connor said he would cut about $15.5 million from the $320 million county budget -- $9 million through a hiring freeze, reduced overtime and an increase in the work week to 40 hours from 32 hours for mid- and upper-level managers in county departments, $6.2 million through consolidation of departments and cuts in the county's car fleet and $250,000 through cuts in trips and conventions for county officials. In addition, he said, his department heads would be required to cut their budgets for an additional $7 million.
Mr. Schuber has outlined $3.4 million in budget cuts, including about $1.4 million in the county motor pool; $1.2 million in county grants to nonprofit groups; $500,000 in county printing costs, $200,000 in trips by county officials and $150,000 in summer jobs.
Both promised a savingsto property-tax payers from the state's pending takeover of $10 million in county costs for welfare and mental health sites and care.
On the issue of garbage disposal, which affects every county household and property-taxpayer, both opposed construction of the proposed $400 million incinerator in Ridgefield. As an alternative, Mr. Schuber proposed increased recycling and construction of a non-burning, composting operation, similar to one in Dade County, Florida, that pulverizes organic trash into a form of topsoil and metals and other non-organic trash into a gravel-type substance for road beds. Mr. O'Connor proposed more recycling and shipping the remainder to a new incinerator in Newark that is too big for Essex County's volume of garbage.

HEADLINE: Water Chief Meets Friends and Foes

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: KATONAH

 BODY:
THE New York City reservoir system occupies 18,000 acres of county land, pays taxes to 20 different communities and for 156 years has affected the development of large parts of Westchester because of its authority over its watershed. After a long hiatus, the city is on the move again.
Last week, the man who supervises the seven-county reservoir system came here to discuss strict new proposals to protect the quality of the huge water-supply network, the first changes contemplated in 37 years. 
 The proposals were designed to preserve the purity of the drinking water of nine million people -- including most county residents -- into the next century by severely limiting "irresponsible development," city officials said. They would prevent thousands of acres in the watershed from being developed, place strict and costly limitations on existing and proposed sewage-treatment systems and impose new restrictions on the disposal of snow and road runoff into local waterways.
If the proposals are not put into effect, the city says, it will be forced to build a $4 billion filtration system to comply with new state and Federal requlations to insure the safety of the water supply.
 
Creativity Is Called For
 "Nothing substitutes for pristine, natural water," Albert F. Appleton, New York City's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, said last week. "We are going to have to be enormously creative and spend a fair amount of money -- some of it ours and some of it money that will add to the costs of development here -- to protect what is a priceless resource, your resource and our resource."
The city is already building a $600 million filtration plant for the Croton system, which lies in Westchester and Putnam Counties and which municipal officials say has been contaminated by over-development. Commissioner Appleton said the proposed regulations "are our tool for insuring that the Croton contamination won't spread" to the much larger Catskill and Delaware systems, which provide 90 percent of the total water supply.
While environmentalists in the New York region and several northern towns who oppose continued development here have been pleased by the city's proposals, developers in the county have criticized them as a severe limit on the county's growth and a threat to an already shaky economy.
 
A Walk Through the Woods
 In an unusual meeting last week called by State Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Westchester developers and environmentalists joined county municipal officials and Commissioner Appleton on a tramp through the woods past a section of the Muscoot Reservoir here polluted by the seepage of phosphorous. The group then sat down at the Katonah Library to discuss the draft regulations published last month.
"We are in the fascinating position of having people sitting here chatting comfortably while they are suing the hell out of each other in court," Mr. Brodsky told the group, in a reference to litigation between developers and municipal officials.
One opponent of tighter restrictions warned that county residents would have to pay higher water bills, and increased septic and sewage costs under the proposals. The opponent, Joseph Baratta, president of Par-Bar Associates, a real estate-development company based in Elmsford, confronted Mr. Appleton in the library:
"New York City is imposing regulations that will cause certain hardship for the citizens of Westchester County. What gives New York City the right to do this?"
 
It All Dates Back to 1834
 "This watershed has been here since 1834," the Commissioner replied. "Nine million people depend on this water and have for well over 150 years. Water is a fundamental health need, and that's what gives us the right."
The city also has the law on its side. There were a number of lawyers at the meeting, including Mr. Brodsky and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who represents the Hudson River Fishermen's Association and is also senior staff lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. In a 1905 state statute, the city won the right to take upstate lands, flood them for reservoirs and create and enforce rules protecting water purity.
Mr. Kennedy said: "I don't look at New York City as any kind of Big Brother telling us what to do. This is our water, which goes to our residents, and I am grateful to New York City for coming and helping us to protect it."
 While the 85-year-old law did create hostility toward the city's water system and its overseers in the past, a mood that lingers in less-developed parts of the watershed, residents in more urban areas have begun to see the city and its water system as providing needed protection against development pressures.
 
Past Mistakes Conceded
 "Thank you for coming to Westchester," said Richard Knabel, president of the Federated Conservationists of Westchester County, a coalition of environmental groups,to Mr. Appleton. "We have been trying for years to get the city's attention."
If the city had exercised its mandate for protecting the watershed more aggressively, Mr. Knabel said, development issues would not be as critical as they appear to be now.
One mistake, Mr. Appleton said, was the city's failure to buffer the reservoirs properly when they were built. "Now, in the late 20th century, we are going to have to play catch-up," he said. "I expect we'll buy some land."
In addition to new regulations, the city has broadened its watershed-protection strategy to include legal action to force compliance with existing regulations, Mr. Appleton said, and renewed pressure on state agencies to require higher standards for sewage-treatment permits.
Developers at last week's meeting said that they agreed with the city's objectives but that the proposals targeted them unfairly.
"We thoroughly recognize the very severe problems existing today in the water supply, problems that will be exacerbated in the future," said Norman Judelson, a principal in the White Plains real estate partnership of Glickenhaus Judelson.
While water quality is deteriorating, fertilizer and road salt are "probably the biggest offenders," he said, and asked, "Why aren't there regulations limiting the use of fertilizers?"
 
Plan Is Called One-Sided
 Mr. Baratta, a member of the board of the Builders Institute, a trade association of several hundred builders in Westchester and Putnam Counties, agreed. "Something has to be done but it shouldn't be so one-sided," Mr. Baratta said. "We don't have any affordable housing; we don't have the means to house the people who work here. These regulations have wide-ranging implications."
Municipal officials from the county who attended the meeting appeared to welcome the city's renewed interest in their localities but many wondered what the cost of the proposals would be and who would pay for them. "Local communities simply can't achieve what the city wants by themselves," said Theodore H. Chase, deputy supervisor of Lewisboro. "We simply do not have the resources."
Guy L. Gagne, Town Engineer of Somers, said he was concerned about the communities with older homes and small septic systems that are draining into the Amawalk Reservoir. Sanitary sewer systems need to be installed in these areas, he said, but "it would be very, very cost- prohibitive to place the entire financial burden on these small communities."
When the town of Bedford recently proposed a $12.6 million referendum to build a sewer system for the downtown hamlet areas of Bedford Hills and Katonah, it was soundly defeated by voters not living in the affected area.
"The city's reservoirs are being polluted slowly but surely by Katonah," the Bedford Town Planning Director, Jeffrey Osterman, told Mr. Appleton. "We really need help."
The informal draft of the proposed regulations will be reviewed by the many communities and constituencies that would be affected, Mr. Appleton said. The results of those discussions will form the basis of a formal draft of the regulations, which is to be published before public hearings planned for early next year. After the hearings, a final proposal will be submitted to the State Department of Health and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection.

HEADLINE: More Urban Enterprise Zones Sought

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD program that provides sales tax exemptions to businesses and customers in the state's most economically depressed cities has proved so successful, officials say, that they are considering asking the Legislature to expand the program to include additional municipalities.
The New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zones Act of 1983 exempts qualifying businesses in parts of 11 cities and towns from paying the state sales tax on purchases and allows shoppers in seven of those municipalities to pay a 3.5 percent tax, or half the normal rate, which is then retained by the municipality. 
 Besides wanting to increase the number of cities and towns participating in the program, officials say they also hope to see some of the present zones expanded, and all the qualifying localities given the right to offer the 50 percent sales tax exemption on consumer purchases.
But while nearly everyone agrees that the program is helping to revitalize deteriorating downtowns by stimulating development, generating employment and increasing reliance on local businesses, some merchants outside the zones say that they are being hurt by the competitive edge stores in the zones hold.
 
Impact on State Budget
 In addition, state officials acknowledge that the success of the program must also be weighed against its impact on the state budget: every sales tax dollar saved by businesses and customers in an urban enterprise zone is a dollar lost to state government.
That impact takes on even greater significance in light of the recent increases in the income tax and the sales tax itself that were adopted to balance the state's $12.4 billion budget.
"The Urban Enterprise Zones Act was passed to improve the economic life of the inner cities," said S. Charles Garofalo, state administrator of the Urban Enterprise Zones program, "and it's doing that job beautifully."
 Mr. Garofalo said that since its inception in 1983, the program has helped create more than 15,000 new jobs in participating cities. In addition, he said, more than $1.5 billion has been privately invested in those cities for commercial construction and rehabilitation. The program, which by law expires after 20 years, is considered a model for similar programs across the country, Mr. Garofalo said. "We get calls from all over the world asking about our program," he said.
 As a result of the program's success, he said, a committee of the state Economic Development Authority recently recommended that the number of participating cities be increased and that the current zones be expanded.
 
Enthusiastically Received
 The Urban Enterprise Zones Act originally allowed for the designation of up to two enterprise zones each year. The first zones were in Camden and Newark -- the two cities deemed by state officials the most in need of assistance.
The program was so enthusiastically received, however, that by 1985 all 10 zones permitted under the act had been designated. There are currently 11 municipalities participating in the program, with Millville and Vineland sharing one zone. Besides Camden and Newark, the other municipalities are Bridgeton, Elizabeth, Jersey City, Kearny, Orange, Plainfield and Trenton.
Each zone covers on average about 30 percent of the city it lies in, with the zone area designated by municipal officials. Municipalities are selected for the program on the basis of need. Businesses in each zone must apply to join the program. To qualify, a business must create at least one permanent full-time job for a resident of the area or, if the business employs 10 or fewer employees, it can qualify by making a capital expenditure of as little as $5,000.
 
'Saved Close to $1,000'
 Once qualified, the business is exempt from paying state sales tax on purchases of equipment and on renovation expenses. And that, business owners say, can mean substantial savings.
"We renovated our store a couple of years ago and saved close to $1,000," said Robert G. Johnston, owner of Johnston Jewelers on West State Street in downtown Trenton. "And I think a lot of other merchants in the area are taking advantage of the program."
Indeed, the savings resulting from participation in the program is limited only by the amount of money a business owner wants to invest. Essentially, a qualified business receives what amounts to a 7 percent discount on almost all purchases.
The savings on new construction, Mr. Garofalo said, can amount to as much as $1.70 a square foot. And that, he said, is at least partly responsible for an increase in the number of new commercial developments and a decrease in the unemployment rate in the cities participating in the program.
 
Luring Suburban Customers
 In Trenton, for instance, the unemployment rate in the city was 8.8 percent in 1984, the year before the program became effective there. By 1988, Mr. Garofalo said, 912 new full-time jobs had been created in the zone, and the unemployment rate in the city dropped to 5.2 percent. Other cities in the program are experiencing similar results.
"In Newark we're doing pretty good," said Rafael Zabala, the coordinator of the city's enterprise zone program.
"As we speak, close to two million square feet of office space is being built within the urban enterprise zone here, and we project an additional 300 jobs will result from that development," Mr. Zabala said.
While one goal of the program is to persuade businesses to remain in the cities, officials say, another is to entice customers to return there from the suburban malls to shop, lured by the 50 percent sales tax reduction on their purchases, on everything except vehicles. The strategy appears to be working.
"It's been an unbelievable boon to us," said Stan Demski, sales manager for the Chopin Piano Company in Trenton. "We have people coming in from all over the place just to save the 3 1/2 percent tax," he said.
 
Street Lights in Trenton
 Besides increasing sales and saving customers money, the program also allows each city to retain the 3.5 percent tax that is collected by participating merchants.
Municipal officials can then use that money to make additional improvements in the zone in conjunction with developers and area businesses.
West State Street between North Broad Street and North Warren Street in Trenton, for example, was formerly a series of privately owned older buildings, said Thomas McGough, coordinator of the city's urban enterprise zone program.
Now, the area contains a pedestrian mall with thriving retail shops on one side and a recently completed $35 million office and retail complex on the other. Part of the money for the street and lighting improvements, Mr. McGough said, was taken from the sales taxes retained by the city.
Trenton's enterprise zone, which encompasses 2.3 square miles, was designed to include as many businesses as possible. Some cities, however, were not able to include all of their commercial areas within the zones.
 
Unfair Edge, Merchants Say
 In those municipalities, some business owners feel that the zones create an environment of unfair competition.
"I think it's totally outrageous," said Joseph DeBrito, an owner of Newark Hardware and Paint Company Inc., a retail business in the Ironbound section of Newark. "One block away from here they're charging 3 1/2 percent tax," he said, referring to the fact that the enterprise zone ends at Pennsylvania Station and does not include the Ferry Street shopping area where his business is situated.
A business in an enterprise zone, he said, has an unfair edge over those businesses not in the zone.
"It's like an invisible barrier," Mr. DeBrito said.
Officials, however, disagree.
"I don't think it gives a business an unfair advantage," said Joseph G. LaMonica, director of communications for the Newark Economic Development Corporation, the city agency that manages the enterprise zone program. "It puts the merchants on a more level playing field."
 
'Justifiable Reward' for Merchants
 Indeed, some experts say, the program was intended to help the businesses that needed help the most.
"It's a device to rebuild the urban centers," said Gerald D. Hall, vice president of the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce. Merchants who enjoy the program's benefits, he said, may be reaping a "justifiable reward for remaining in the worst part of the city."
 Perhaps the best indicator of the success of the program is the desire of municipalities to participate.
Of the 11 municipalities that now have urban enterprise zones, four -- Kearny, Jersey City, Elizabeth and Orange -- are not permitted to offer the 50 percent sales tax exemption on customer purchases. All, however, want to.
"The four zones without the 50 percent sales tax amenity are at a complete disadvantage as they relate to the other zones," said Thomas V. Henderson, the coordinator of Orange's urban enterprise zone program. "We are hopeful that this discrepancy will be rectified in the very near future."
 
Salem County as Urban Zone
 Indeed, State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, Democrat of Elizabeth, has introduced legislation that would extend the 50 percent reduction to qualified businesses in all urban enterprise zones.
In addition, several other bills have been introduced to expand existing zones or create new ones. One bill, proposed by Assemblyman Frank A. LoBiondo, Republican of Vineland, would broaden the definition of eligibility for the program. Another, sponsored by State Senator Raymond J. Zane, Democrat of Woodbury, would designate all of Salem County as an urban enterprise zone.
"It may be parochial," Mr. Zane said of his proposal, "but with great justification." Salem County, he said, is just across the river from Wilmington, Del., where no sales tax at all is charged on purchases.
But while legislators, municipal officials and business owners support the idea of increased or expanded enterprise zones, state officials are wary of taking any steps that might decrease state revenues.
 "This is a very sensitive area now," said James N. Albers, chief of staff of the state Department of Commerce and chairman of the state Economic Development Authority. "We're talking about taking revenues out of the state treasury."
 
Report Finds Revenue Increase
 Before the authority could endorse such an idea, Mr. Albers said, the members would have to be satisfied that the benefits outweighed the potential loss of revenue.
Officials are encouraged, however, by a recent study of the state's program conducted by Dr. Marilyn Marks Rubin, associate professor of public administration and economics at John Jay College in New York. The study was paid for by the New Jersey Department of Commerce.
Dr. Rubin's study concluded that the state's urban enterprise zone program "is a cost-effective economic development tool." For every $1 of state sales tax revenue foregone as a result of tax exemptions, almost $2 more is gained from state and local taxes on the economic activity generated by the program, the study said.
 In addition, Dr. Rubin said, her study indicates that the economy of the 11 municipalities in the program showed improvement when compared with the economy of the seven others that applied to participate but were not chosen.
"Urban enterprise zones are not a panacea," Dr. Rubin said. "But if they can keep a city like Newark alive, then they're doing what they're supposed to be doing."

HEADLINE: Budget Fight Hinders Races for Congress

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE shortest election campaign period in the modern history of the House of Representatives has frustrated incumbents fearful of an angry electorate, impeded the efforts of challengers facing long odds under the best of circumstances and aggravated the organizers of debates.
Members of Congress, who had planned on at least a month of uninterrupted campaigning in their bids for re-election, have only 10 days to convince voters that the "mess in Washington," as challengers described the bitter and drawn-out negotiations over a Federal budget, was not their doing. 
 In the 20th Congressional District, where the Democrat Nita M. Lowey is seeking a second term, her two opponents, Glenn D. Bellitto, a Republican, and John M. Schafer, a Conservative, have grown accustomed to debating each other in the presence of a substitute for Ms. Lowey.
Mr. Bellitto, who has taken a leave of absence form his job at General Foods to campaign, said he feels there is "a growing anti-incumbency vote" among voters. "I go to train stations and supermarkets, and more and more people ask, 'Are you in or out?' When I say I'm out" -- the challenger -- "they say, 'Great. You have my vote.' "
 
85-Year-Old Opponent
 Benjamin A. Gilman, the nine-term Republican seeking re-election in the 22nd Congressional District that includes only Greenburgh in Westchester County, decided weeks ago not to use substitutes in debates he could not attend, so his 85-year-old Democratic opponent, John G. Dow, has faced an empty chair or a "speaker box" linked by telephone to Washington.
Mr. Dow is a former three-term Congressman whom Mr. Gilman defeated in 1972 to win the seat and again in 1974 to retain it. Mr. Dow said he "did not care whether Gilman comes to debates or not" because "I can say what I want whether he's here or not." Mr. Dow said he was "a reformer by tradition and reputation."
The district, which includes Rockland County and parts of Orange and Sullivan Counties, also has a Right to Life Party candidate, Margaret M. Beirne. Andrew J. Zarutskie, who is press secretary for the 67-year-old Mr. Gilman, offered an example of the campaigning acrobatics forced on incumbents by the budget debate.
He said the Representative had made two round trips from Washington last weekend, on Friday and Saturday nights, to attend events. "He had planned a third trip on Sunday night to attend a Monday-morning editorial debate, when he learned that the House was going to reconvene at 10 A.M. on Monday, so he had to stay."
The newspaper canceled the debate, which was intended to help determine an election endorsement, Mr. Zarutskie said, "but some groups are not quite so understanding." Mr. Gilman, his spokesman said, "would rather be on the hustings; he's down here and doesn't know what the other fellow is doing."
William J. Gouldman, a Bronx Republican who is seeking to replace Eliot L. Engel, a freshman Democrat, in the 19th Congressional District, said he felt people had "become apathetic about what's going on in Washington." Mr. Gouldman, who is in the insurance business and has an office in Tarrytown, said he had counted on debating Mr. Engel to get the political exposure "because I know it's an uphill battle."
 
'Voters Tired of Congress'
 "Two years ago," Mr. Gouldman said, "98 percent of the Congressional Representatives who wanted to be re-elected were re-elected, but only 50 percent of the electorate voted. This gave me a positive outlook that the voters throughout the nation were getting tired of the way Congress was doing its job and would like to see new leadership."
The 19th District was represented by Mario Biaggi until the Democrat's conviction in 1987 for accepting an illegal gratuity, a paid vacation and for obstructing justice. The district reaches into Westchester to include about two thirds of Yonkers , but is predominantly in the northeast Bronx, stretching from City Island and Coop City to Riverdale. The Conservative candidate, Kevin Brawley, also has Right to Life endorsement.
Mr. Engel's spokesman, John Calvelli, said, "We've spoken at seminars and forums with Mr. Gouldman and have had people filling in for the Representative at debates and meetings he could not attend. We thought it was important for the budget crisis to be resolved before the members of Congress could go home."
In the 21st Congressional District, which includes the northern third of Westchester as well as Putnam, Dutchess and part of Orange Counties, Hamilton Fish Jr., the 11-term Republican incumbent who has Conservative Party endorsement, is being challenged by Richard L. Barbuto. Mr. Barbuto, a Democrat, said he had "no hope that Mr. Fish will attend any of the debates we've scheduled."
Mr. Barbuto, who served one term as a Croton-on--Hudson Trustee and has been unsuccessful in other election campaigns at village, town, county and state levels, said he had "taken over from Larry Grunberger, who ran three times against Mr. Fish, and I intend to go again" if the current bid to unseat Mr. Fish fails. The Right to Life Party candidate is Richard S. Curtin.
Mr. Barbuto, a banker, said he favored a tax on imported oil as a means of providing the incentive "for a true energy alternative," and is generally against what he says is "the tyranny of the status quo." He said Mr. Fish had not dealt with "pocketbook issues" of the district.
 
'Not Much Difficulty'
 Mr. Fish's press spokesman, Fred Stokeld, said the Representative had returned to the district "when he could" during the intense negotiations over the budget and in the meantime was using advertisements on radio and in newspapers to keep his constituents informed. "With 22 years in office," Mr. Stokeld said, "he's not in as much difficulty as other Congressmen."
The only Congressional District entirely within Westchester, and thus the one affecting the most voters in the county, is Ms. Lowey's. She won narrowly in 1988, ousting the Republican incumbent, Joseph J. DioGuardi, in part through the disclosure just before the election of irregularities in his campaign financing. Employees of an auto dealership were allegedly reimbursed by their employer for their donations to Mr. DioGuardi's campaign.
Last week, Aldo V. Vitagliano, a Rye lawyer who said he had intended to run against Ms. Lowey this year, charged her with "gross violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act" in 1988 by "failing to properly disclose contributions of $250,000 to her campaign within the 48 hours required by law." He said the money had come from Ms. Lowey within the last 12 days of the campaign.
Robert Bauer, a lawyer with the Federal Election Commission, said the 48-hour rule applied to special-interest groups, "to make available to the public 11th-hour contributions from private interests." He said that since Ms. Lowey "was a candidate, she was not subject to those limitations, because the Supreme Court has ruled that you cannot corrupt your own campaign."
 
Lowey's Defends Herself
 Mr. Vitagliano said: "She bought the seat with the huge sums and is repaying herself this year with money from political action committees. She has raised $540,000, or 60 times more than her opponents combined."
Ms. Lowey said that "the charge will be proved empty, as a similar charge of illegal contributions was proved empty two years ago."
Mr. Schafer, the Conservative candidate opposing her, who also has Right to Life backing, said he did not think Ms. Lowey had spent anything close to the $500,000 she has raised, "although I suppose we'll see some television ads soon." He added that she had not attended scheduled debates in the district.
He said, "It's not like saying the dog ate her homework -- she can't show up if there are votes or other matters keeping her in Washington -- but she's made no great effort" to debate her two opponents.
Ms. Lowey said she had "agreed to every debate, over a dozen," and had attended two of them. Nothing would please her more, she said, than dealing with her opponents face to face.
"The challengers have been out there with no responsibilities, distorting members' records," she said. "They can say whatever they want; they don't have to produce and they don't have to vote." Ms. Lowey said that before the budget debate she had voted to cut back on farm subsidies and to make "serious cuts" in the military budget.
 
'Worst of All Scenarios'
 Mr. Schafer said Ms. Lowey represented "the worst of all possible scenarios, a recession that could turn into a depression with taxes being raised, and a war we could lose with cuts in defense spending."
She said the round-the-clock budget negotiations leading to a final package "were intended to make sure that the taxes President Bush said would have to be raised were distributed fairly and evenly."
Mr. Bellitto said he had focused on "the mess in Washington, which Ms. Lowey's absence from the district highlighted," claiming that "the incumbent is part of the problem." He said that "our NATO allies and Japan should start sharing our common defense costs." Congress, he said, had made some cuts in farm subsidies and in other areas, "but the cuts are too little; costs have to be slashed."
He said he also favored a 12-year limit, or a maximum of six terms, for United States Representatives "to avoid a class of professional politicians -- or bureaucrats turned politician -- like Ms. Lowey." Ms. Lowey left an Albany post as assistant secretary of state to run for Congress in the 20th District, which includes all of southern and central Westchester except the Greenburgh and Yonkers parcels in Mr. Gilman's and Mr. Engel's districts.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
ON the corner of Court Street and what once was known as High Street, now Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, in the Central Ward of Newark, there stands one of the grandest houses ever built in that rawboned community, a symbol of what Newark once was and a rallying point for what it might someday become.
It does not look like much now. The roof, three stories above the sidewalk, is blanketed with black plastic. Windows are boarded up; brownstone lintels are cracked and broken;, steps list so badly that were they not made of stone they would have slipped into the mud a long time ago. 
 Still, beneath the wrinkles, grandeur peeks out. It is not hard to imagine old Gottfried Krueger, the German beer baron who built the place in 1888, gazing contently over the city from the 50-foot-high observatory at the prow of the masonry mansion. Or to imagine the measured voice of Louise Scott, who is said to have been Newark's first black millionaire, greeting guests beneath the stained-glass dome in the central corridor of the house she bought in 1958.
After Mrs. Scott died in 1983, the city took over the mansion, a ransom for unpaid back taxes. In a little while the vandals took over, trashing the place and stealing every mahogany mantel, life-size wooden statue and panel of cherry wainscoting. Packs of wild dogs gnawed their way in, and pigeons roosted in the elevator shaft. Vagrants lighted fires that nearly burned the place down.
As recently as last winter, city officials were saying that Newark could not afford to keep the 25-room Krueger-Scott Mansion standing. But under pressure from people in the neighborhood, and with the help of a $436,000 state grant, Newark came up with $2.8 million and commitments from private interests in the city to save the house and turn it into a cultural center of black history.
This is an important step for a city that sometimes has been at war with its past and unable to come to grips with what it has become. A modest ceremony was recently held to begin rehabilitation of the mansion. Louise Scott, the 30-year-old daughter of the former owner, was there, puffed up with pride and close to tears as she walked through the badly deteriorated remains of the house, in which she had been raised.
"This is not the house I left," she said, inside for the first time since 1983. "It hurts to see it this way."
There is something about old houses that makes them intensely evocative. They are like old people, rocking on a sunny porch, who have seen much, been through much. If only they could talk.
It is that way in the Krueger-Scott Mansion. Poking around its eccentric rooms and strange corners with Ms. Scott, a visitor glimpsed several layers of a city's history unfolding. The entrance foyer was dark, almost black, but in the diagonally cut tiles on the floor were clearly displayed the initials G and K, still as arrogantly indelible as when they were first laid in wet cement 102 years ago.
The initials are those of Gottfried Krueger, who arrived almost penniless in Newark in 1852 and by 1875 was sole owner of Krueger Breweries, a major producer of beer that operated until 1960 and was the first major brewery to sell beer in a can. Like Peter Ballantine and Christian Fiegenspan, other wealthy Newark brewers, Mr.Krueger delighted in showing off his success. On the highest point in the city, along the grandest street, he built a house so splendid that everyone would see that he was successful.
Charles F. Cummings, Newark's historian, said Mr. Krueger represented the very essence of the 19th-century, rags-to-riches success story.
"He went from poor immigrant to rich burger in just a lifetime," Mr. Cummings said.
In 1925, well after Mr.Krueger had died, his house was sold to a Masonic lodge. Then in 1958, at the start of Newark's social and economic dissolution, the house was sold again, this time to Louise Scott. She, like the brewer, had started with almost nothing, having come from South Carolina to New York to work as a domestic during the day, studying to become a beautician at night.
In 1940 she moved to Newark and opened her first beauty parlor. Soon she had five salons, a guesthouse and a hotel. When she purchased the Krueger Mansion and made it the Scott College of Beauty Culture and the center of her civic and business enterprises, she was said to be a millionaire.
Although they were as different as two people could be, Gottfried Krueger and Louise Scott shared the same diligence, vision and drive to pay back in some way the community in which they had once struggled. Thus, since 1888, the mansion on the corner of High and Court Streets has been a focus of community activities. Mr. Krueger was an assemblyman, a judge and a founder of a home for the aged. Mrs. Scott started a nursery and baby clinic and accommodated groups of the elderly, disadvantaged and those searching for hope.
Mrs. Scott also raised a family there, and her daughter remembers what it was like growing up in the house at the center of the city. "This was my room, this was my baby sitter's room and this was my other room later," Ms. Scott said, sweeping quickly through the mansion's second floor.
She remembers her mother throwing the house open on many a day and night. She remembers her mother broadcasting messages of hope from a first-floor drawing room. She remembers weddings held there, and anniversaries and the other important occasions that blow life into a neighborhood.
Now that the house will again become a center of city culture, she sees hope reviving in the debris that remains. "There's so much blood and fighting on the streets now," she said. "If we give our black youth some history, maybe tomorrow will be a better day."
Speaking at the public ceremony, Mayor Sharpe James said the city was committed "not only to renovating a building of mortar and bricks but to bringing people and ideas together."
For many in this city of empty lots and vacant buildings, saving the grand house on High Street counters, in small measure, Newark's past disasters, like the high-rise public housing projects just a block away that were blasted to pieces, a final, deafening confession of government's inability to care for its own.
"This building," Mr. James said, "shows what Newark was like in the past during its greatest history and what Newark can become if we all work together."
Ms. Scott stood quietly on the back of the dais while the officials went on about the importance of preserving her former home. She held in her hands a book of poems by Langston Hughes, a bookmark next to one poem entitled "History." The poem, she said, expressed her feelings on that most important and exciting day. The poem was for Newark.
 
 The past has been a mint
 Of blood and sorrow.
 That must not be
 True of tomorrow.

A Wicked Witch, an Orange Moon and the Snarled Traffic

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

 BODY:
WOODCLIFF LAKE
ALONG a half-mile stretch of Chestnut Ridge Road, traffic backs up, the lines are long and a steady wind ripples the tattered dress of a wicked witch against the backdrop of an orange moon on display at one of the farms in the distance.
And yet for all the drumming fingers on steering wheels and anxious glances, once the drivers get to the farms, a glass of fresh apple cider, a dozen doughnuts and pumpkins the size of many small children help to relieve the tension. 
 Like Halloween itself, the traffic that snarls roads here on October weekends is as much a tradition as hayrides and Indian corn tacked onto doors..
For two working farms and the families that operate them, this season mixes the hope of a profitable harvest with the long hours and children's laughter. Yet it was not always so.
Several years ago, before Chestnut Ridge Road was widened in 1988, traffic lights installed and a new exit, 171, opened nearby off the Garden State Parkway, it was not uncommon for families bound for these farming outlets, once roadside fruit and vegetable stands, to sit and wait in their cars for hours until parking spaces appeared. At its worst now, the wait can be from 20 minutes to a half-hour. Tempers often frayed and local police officers, hired by the farms, would find themselves as useful as the limp scarecrows guarding adjacent corn fields.
"There came a time when we needed change and that change helped out a great deal," said Richard F. Tice, 61 years old, a partner in the 10-acre Tice Farm, run by the family since 1910. "As this area has grown, so have we all and growth here means traffic," he said.
The congestion forced local officials to call for county and state aid to widen the road, even though borough residents for years had learned to use back roads to get from one end of town to another.
Both Mr. Tice and Peter Van Riper, a co-owner with his brother, Arthur, of Van Riper's Farm just down the road, say that their agricultural operations were not responsible for the improvements.
Borough officials disagree. They point out farmland sold off by the families over the last 15 years and developed as office parks and hotels increased traffic year-round and forced the widening of the road.
Mr. Tice and Mr. Van Riper, who are cousins, shrug off the suggestion. "It's my understanding that the improvements were made so that emergency vehicles could get in and out without having to battle the traffic," Mr. Van Riper said. "We still get those tie-ups, but it's a matter of minutes now, not an eternity."
While the families' business interests have branched out to real-estate development, they both see themselves as simple farmers who have melded into the 20th century. Farms in the state are declining in record numbers, according to the state Department of Agriculture, partly because of the financial lure of developers offering huge sums for land that was once home only to rich crops and weeping willow trees.
"I guess we could have sold out years ago but some things are hard to get out of your blood," Mr. Tice said. "There's a satisfaction from it that few people today will ever know because hard work comes from working the fields and growing and harvesting and passing on those things to others."
For Mr. Van Riper, 56, the grip of the land is hard to release for much the same reasons. He represents the 10th generation of his family to toil the earth; his forebears came from Holland and settled in the area in 1791. "This is the life that I know, that I have always known," he said. "And it's what I want to pass on." But for both families, modernization has helped the farming tradition compete in hard economic times that have forced others in the state's 21 counties to abandon their land.
In October 1979, an electrical fire destroyed a building that the Tices used to sell their fruit and vegetables just as the weekend crush began. "A day and a half later, we cleaned up the mess, pitched a circus tent and were back in business," Mr. Tice said.
What he chose to rebuildthe next year was a "country mall" complete with space for fruit and vegetables as well as some 30 stores including a dry cleaners, a gourmet cheese shop and an arts and crafts store. While it may have diminished some of the farm's country charm, Mr. Tice says it provided the means to stay in business. Both families say there is no rivalry between the two; a tractor-pulled hayride transports customers to both locations.
Yet the families' need to cultivate the soil is both bitter and sweet. For Mr. Tice, the dream of passing on the business from father to son ended when his oldest child died of cancer several years back. Today his daughter and son-in-law help to manage the operation. Mr. Van Riper's children have sought careers other than farming.
 "I'd like this to remain a family business," he said, "but I don't know what the future holds."
But to the thousands who visit the two farms as Halloween nears, the holiday tradition is a family affair and more. At Van Riper's the greenhouse is transformed into a scene from "The Wizard of Oz" and a mock graveyard complete with a dozing Dracula and amplified ghostly shrieks tantalize both the young and old.
"We're all having a grand time here, just look at the smiles," said Ray Pitt of Leonia looking at his two granddaughters, Emily, 4, and Isabella, 2, at Mr. Van Riper's farm. "It wasn't that long ago that we took our own kids here."
"Look, Mommy! The pumpkin patch!" said a chestnut-haired 3-uear-old boy, pressed into his mother's arms. "Is the great pumpkin here? Mommy, is he here?"
For Debra L. Fox of Mahwah and her two children, Adam, 4, and Michelle, 9 months, Halloween pumpkins cannot be picked in a supermarket.
"When I was little this was where Halloween came alive for me and now as a mom with my own, it's twice as good, twice as special," she said as her children cradled small pumpkins.
One sign of a strained economy, Mr. Tice and Mr. Van Riper noted, are customers who would traditionally decorate one pumpkin and buy another for display but are now buying only one to do both jobs. An average pumpkin costs from $8 to $10.
"The prices are a little high this year, but maybe I'm just feeling it more because I'm on the giving end now instead of the receiving end," said Jackie Manzi of Hasbrouck Heights as her two children, 4 and 17 months, looked at the rows of pumpkins. Her friend, Ruth Botto of Maywood, told her children : "Don't touch! Please put that back on the table! Get off the pumpkins, please, guys!"
For Mike Lotito, 30, of Wyckoff, the choice of a Halloween pumpkin was the excuse to take the day off from work and share an afternoon with his 4-year-old son Thomas. "This is our day together," he said, recalling that when he was a child, "things were a lot different."
Mr. Lotito recalled: "I remember that around Halloween, we'd come here and get stuck in traffic and my dad would get so mad that he'd mutter, 'We're getting out of here,' and my mom and us kids in the back would holler 'Oh no we're not!Those were good memories and this guy here and I are creating our own."
For some farm family members, the rewards of their work are in the wide eyes and cotton candy stains on children's fingers.
"It moves me to see regular customers who were kids back then come back with their own now," said Bonnie Van Riper, Mr. Van Riper's sister-in-law. "The faces change a little, but that glow is always in their eyes."
For Mr. Van Riper, the weekend chaos is never dull.
"A few years ago, before they widened the roads, I asked a guy why in the world he waited three hours in traffic to get here," Mr. Van Ripersaid. "He said, 'It's a hell of a lot better than raking leaves.' "

Seeking Women To Protect Others After Dark

DATELINE: SWARTHMORE, Pa.

 BODY:
As students leave Swarthmore College's library or social center late at night, a woman may offer to walk them home. This semester, five women are acting as escorts in the college's Safewalk service, a security program in which students offer to accompany men and women back to their dormitories.
While Safewalk has hired women in the past, typically only one or two apply and work each semester. The low turnout may have been traceable to a belief that only men could become escorts, said Christina M. Saunders, the program's first female coordinator. 
 Miss Saunders, a senior from Olney, Md., majoring in sociology/anthropology and psychology, said she publicized Safewalk's nondiscriminatory policy when she became coordinator this spring. However, the number of women seeking the jobs did not increase until this fall, when all who applied were hired.
"The philosophy of the program has been prevention rather than protection," Miss Saunders said, explaining that having two students walking together may deter potential attacks. For that reason, she said, women can be as effective as men.
 
 Are Women Patronized by Men?
 Although most of the 31 Safewalk staff members are men, the presence of women should encourage more women to use the service, Miss Saunders said. Currently, the majority of Safewalk's users are women, she noted. Escorts usually work about two and a half hours a week and are paid from $4.30 to $4.55 an hour.
Nicoletta Karam, co-coordinator of Friends of Survivors, a campus group dedicated to promoting awareness about sexual assault, said many women feel patronized when men offer to escort them home.
"You feel as though they question your ability to help yourself," said Ms. Karam, a junior history major from San Francisco.
Ms. Karam said that with the presence of female escorts, she would be more inclined to have someone walk her home, be it a man or a woman. She said Safewalk has become less a perpetuation of the stereotype of the helpless woman.
"The pressures are much lower in accepting a woman escort," said Heather Blair, a first-year student from Seattle who was recently hired as an escort. "You don't feel as if you are being weak or being protected."
Miss Blair said that although she was subjected to occasional laughs when she offered to escort men, most of the feedback from men as well as women has been positive.
Brian J. Zikmund, a fourth-year Safewalker from San Bruno, Calif., majoring in economics, said having female escorts "makes it very clear to all concerned that their Safewalk service is a security-related program and does not have an inherent gender issue."
Nevertheless, some at Swarthmore have raised concerns about the use of women, since the escorts must return alone after dropping off a student at a dorm. Most students agree, however, that the campus is generally safe.
Carolyn Fay, in her second semester as an escort, said she felt "very omfortable walking by myself" in a campus where very few incidents take place.
Ms. Fay, a junior from Gradyville, Pa., majoring in French literature, said she applied as an escort to break traditional gender roles. "I thought it would be neat to do something that a lot of women don't do," she said.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Escaping the Capital Shortage

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
THE Bush Administration and leaders in the House and Senate finally cobbled together a budget agreement last week. And if it sticks, it might even have a real -- although small -- shrinking effect on the nation's budget deficit.
But for the equity investor, the reduction will not be enough, by any stretch, to ease the growing capital supply problem that is coloring the economic outlook for the next year. Nor will the situation be helped even if the Middle East crisis is resolved relatively quickly. 
 That is because the United States, which has become the world's largest debtor, will still need billions of dollars in foreign capital to cover its trade and budget deficits. And Eastern Europe will also be screaming for capital to rebuild itself after more than 40 years of Communist rule.
Yet the world's two main creditors, Japan and Germany, have less to lend, perhaps much less. Japan, the largest exporter of capital, is pulling back as money is brought home to help recapitalize banks and cushion their losses from the Tokyo stock market's decline this year of nearly 50 percent. And Germany has to pay for the rebuilding of the old East Germany.
This capital imbalance, at least for now, is the reason for the bear market outlook of David C. Roche, the co-director of research for Morgan Stanley & Company in London. It accounts for his predisposition to invest in cash or bonds in Europe.
Mr. Roche is worried that bankruptcies of major companies suddenly may start to pop up, shaking the financial markets. And he concludes that the worsening outlook for growth and inflation in Europe will aggravate the capital problem by enlarging deficits there next year.
The consequence of meeting this capital demand, he said in an interview last week, is going to be a rise in overall savings. The attraction of high interest rates diverts consumer spending into savings, which in turn slows economic growth. This rise in savings and resulting slowdown was already under way before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Mr. Roche expects consumers to continue saving because rates will remain relatively high for the next few months.
The question is just how severe the slowdown will be. Mr. Roche expects "recessionary periods," or quarters, next year in which growth will decline in Italy, Scandinavia and possibly in France and Spain. A recession is likely in Britain. Germany is still growing the most but it is not the engine it might have been for the rest of Europe. Because of its central role in the European economy, Germany has exported its high interest rates to its neighbors and that has been enough to offset the growth generated by rising European exports to Germany.
Mr. Roche has cut his forecast for growth in Europe in 1991 to 1.9 percent, from 2.7 percent. And he predicts earnings per share will drop by 2.6 percent, a dramatic shift from his previous forecast of a 4.5 percent increase.
But because Mr. Roche believes the economic slowdown in Europe is being caused by rising savings, he also thinks a turnaround can come quickly with a decline in interest rates. He notes that household income in Europe has been rising this year, so consumers are not losing buying power. They are just deciding to save more because of the high rates they can earn.
This all combines to form an approach to equities that inspires caution but also encourages investors to be ready to pounce.
So while Mr. Roche still likes cash, he has reduced his cash position to 13 percent, from 19 percent, in order to buy bonds in Europe, especially Germany and France, because he feels interest rates are near their peak.
And he has a new interest in Japan, where the recent rise in the yen and a small drop in interest rates have sparked a nice rally. "I just feel that the relative strength of Japan to Europe no longer directs such a strong overweight to Europe," he said.
In Europe, Mr. Roche is staying away from chemicals, automobiles, machine tools, airlines (except for Germany's Lufthansa) and hotels. These will all suffer in the slowdown. He is also staying away from many banks for now, selling Credit Lyonnais in France and Banco Commerciale Italiana, among others. (But he is keeping his banks in Germany.) As for countries, he is avoiding investments in Italy (except for telecommunications), Greece, Turkey, Spain and Sweden; he does not think they will rebound quickly. Italy has deep budget problems, for example, and Sweden is facing an economic overhaul.
Mr. Roche likes companies that will play a role in the remaking of the old East Germany and the rest of Eastern Europe: road builders, telephone companies, office suppliers and utilities, among others.
This theme has piqued his interest in Germany although he expects a 4 percent overall decline in earnings there next year. He thinks most of this decline will be borne by the chemical, auto and other stocks that he is avoiding. On his "buy" list: Siemens, Hochtief, Mannesmann and Bilfinger & Berger. He also likes CGE and Saint Gobain in France.
"I can find stocks," he said, "that are doing things that can get done despite the economic cycle."

HEADLINE: All About/Elevators;
Building Business on a Few Seconds' Edge

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
TODAY'S concrete urban jungles owe their characters not only to architects and engineers, but to the unassuming electric elevator. Its invention in 1889 by Otis Elevator Inc. ushered in the age of the skyscraper. The 20-story Flatiron Building in Manhattan, built in 1902 with five electric lifts -- still operating -- was one of the early structures to use the new technology.
Today, elevator researchers are not after revolutionary advances but incremental jumps -- speedier rides for passengers and shorter waits. For manufacturers, any edge can make a difference in what has become a hotly competitive market. 
 Consolidation has kindled competition. The top three companies, Otis, the Swiss-based Schindler Group and Kone of Finland, now control 50 percent of the worldwide market, up sharply from 1980. Kone and Schindler have expanded to stand taller against the world leader, Otis. And all three have widened their reach in an increasingly global business and participated in the robust growth of the last decade.
Sparked by a building boom that has spread from the United States to Europe and Asia and by the development of third world cities, the worldwide elevator market expanded by about 15 percent a year through the early 1980's, and reached $17 billion in sales last year. About 40 percent of those sales came from maintaining and modernizing elevators; new installations accounted for the rest.
But installations have recently begun to taper off, stoking rivalries. Orders have suffered from the decline in office construction in the United States, the biggest outlet for new elevators. Second-quarter sales of the leading elevator companies fell by an average of 5 percent, and some dropped by as much as 20 percent.
"It is no secret that there is a recession, or something like it, and that the construction sector has been hit harder than any other," said David J. Bauhs, president and chief executive of United States operations of the Schindler, the world's No. 2 elevator maker. The unavailability of financing and high vacancy rates have hurt us, too."
Elevator prices, which range from $25,000 to $500,000 apiece, have started to slip. "We're seeing heavy price pressure and we anticipate that prices will fall 2 to 6 percent in 1991," said James Cocca, vice president of marketing in the United States for Schindler.

 
 
Greener Markets

 
Stability in Europe, A Boom in Asia
 To cope, companies are stressing less mature markets like Asia, Europe and Eastern Europe. While the United States market has expanded by only about 2 percent a year since 1986, to about $4.2 billion last year, annual growth in Europe has remained strong, at 10 percent a year, for total sales of $5.9 million in 1989.
The industrialization in Asia has also kept momentum building. "We have seen 30 percent annual growth in new elevator orders in Japan for each of the last four years," said George A.L. David, chairman and chief executive of Otis, a subsidiary of the United Technologies Corporation. Last year, Otis built an engineering center in Japan and recently introduced a new, space-saving elevator motor there.
Manufacturers are also chasing the market for elevator maintenance, repair and modernization, which has grown by 25 percent since 1985, to about $7 billion last year. While big manufacturers like Schindler have grown by concentrating on installation, they have lately pushed harder in the service business. They calculate that as new construction slows and investment in older buildings shrinks, property owners will have no choice but to modernize elevators.
That will put new pressure on the small elevator companies, which have largely been pushed out of manufacturing by bigger rivals and which have turned servicing into their specialty. The big manufacturers may deem some of them attractive acquisition targets.

 
 
Shifting Strategies

Turf Battles On a Global Scale
Acquisition, in fact, has been the main mode of growth for the three largest elevator makers -- and has dramatically reshaped the industry in the last two decades. In the 70's, dozens of elevator manufacturers were scattered throughout the world, each typically with a dominant market share in its home country. Only one, Otis Elevator, had plants and operations around the globe.
Today, Otis remains the foremost elevator manufacturer, with sales of $3.3 billion in 1989, up from $1.6 billion in 1980. But it faces far stronger competition.
The bulging elevator market in the United States beckoned foreign elevator producers to challenge Otis on its home turf in the early 80's. With sales of $2.3 billion last year, Schindler, for instance, has expanded its share of the global market to about 15 percent, from 7 percent in 1980.
Last year, Schindler acquired the elevator and escalator business of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, giving Schindler a large research center in the United States, in addition to one in Switzerland. Schindler had already purchased elevator companies in Japan, India, Kenya, Chile and Hungary.
Kone, with $1.6 billion-a-year in sales, has followed a similar tack. Five years ago, it bought the Armor Elevator Company of Louisville, Ky., a specialist in service and modernization. It has since purchased two of Italy's largest independent elevator companies: Fiam and Sabiem.
In recent years, Mitsubishi and Hitachi, large producers in Japan, have also become more visible, although they have yet to establish a global presence and their manufacturing plants are based primarily in Japan. Still, Otis and Schindler expect them to acquire elevators companies in the United States and Europe. At the same time, Otis has been expanding as feverishly as its rivals, invading many of their home markets. It has bought four small Italian elevator makers, three in Britain and one in Germany in the last 15 years. In the last year, it has solidified its presence in Eastern Europe, the development of which, Otis claims, could double its sales.
But Otis is unlikely to have the market to itself. Both Schindler and Kone have been setting up joint ventures and buying major interests in elevator companies in East Germany and in Hungary.
Meanwhile, these changes in the market have pushed out many small American companies and have driven others into niche markets, like elevators for small apartment houses or freight elevators. "There is always a niche for smaller companies who might focus on the two- and three-story buildings," said George R. Strakosch, an editor at Elevator World, a trade publication in Mobile, Ala.

 
 
Shaving Off Seconds

The Mighty Microprocessor
The difference between a 20-second wait and a 15-second wait is of little consequence for the average elevator passenger. But for manufacturers, it can mean the difference between winning and losing a contract.
As rivalries have grown, so have the research outlays by companies to develop ways to improve response and delivery times. Otis, for instance, will spend $80 million on research this year, up from $26 million five years ago.
Microprocessors have already allowed elevator control systems to be programmed for dispatching, and their uses are being broadened. Researchers at the major companies are developing computerized systems that dispatch elevators to floors according to traffic patterns detected by a control system during the course of a week. In addition to microprocessor technology, this system depends on perfecting the complex algorithms in an elevator's computer system that decide, for instance, how best to distribute cars in a high-rise building that has more than one elevator.
At Otis and Schindler, researchers are also working on a system that can determine the number of people waiting for an elevator. Now an elevator is unable to detect, once a call button is pushed, whether there is one passenger or 40 waiting on a floor. But engineers at Otis have found that lasers can count the number of people waiting in an area and relay that information to the dispatching system, which would then use it to decide the number of elevators to send to the floor.
In addition, elevator companies are developing systems that would shave seconds off their performance times. Researchers at Otis are close to selling systems that will place sensors near the elevators on each floor of a high-rise building which can determine whether people are moving toward the elevator as it approaches a floor. If no one approaches, the doors will close quickly rather than remain open for several seconds.
 
 
THE REMNANTS OF A GENTLER AGE

 A GENERATION ago, the men and women who operated elevators were almost fixtures in office buildings, apartment houses and department stores. But in the last 30 years, with the evolution of elevator technology, the profession has virtually vanished.
Indeed, in New York City, which has historically had the largest number of elevator operators, the number of unionized elevator operators has dwindled to 1,000, from 20,000 in 1950. "There was a time when you could walk into almost any high-rise building in New York City and see an elevator operator," said John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union in Washington. "But this is an area that technology has done away with."
The feature that put many operators out of business were the elevator buttons that allow riders to designate their own destinations. Previously, operators actually drove the elevators, guided by a combination of lights, bells and landmarks to line up the elevator door with the door onto a given floor.
The largest number of elevator operators, Mr. Sweeney said, is in New York and Chicago; there are fewer in the West and Southwest, where skyscrapers were built only after technology had made operators obsolete.
There are a few elevator operators left, but they tend to be in luxury apartment apartment buildings and sometimes, in department stores.
"I keep elevator operators in some of my buildings because it lends a certain air of luxury and elegance," said the owner of several apartment buildings on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The owner, who insisted on remaininganonymous, added that he had also continued to employ elevator operators because he uses older, manual elevators in those buildings.

THE ECONOMY
 
 
A Tisket, a Tasket, Taxes in a Basket

 After five months of nettlesome negotiations, Congress and President Bush finally seem to be of one mind about how to reduce the Federal deficit. And not a moment too soon: After dwindling to manageable levels in the late 1980's, the budget deficit surged in this fiscal year, which just ended, to a near-record $220.4 billion. The budget accord reached by Congressional leaders on Wednesday, which has the tacit approval of the President, is similar to the rejected plan announced in September, placing a burden on drivers, liquor drinkers, smokers and the wealthy. But this package would ask the rich to pay more than the first accord did and would give the poor a bigger break. Among the winners are the energy producers, which get a tax break for drilling and for making ethanol. One big loser: life insurers, which face the biggest tax increase of any industry.
 
Cleaner Air, but Count the Cost
 Cleaner air is in sight, but it may cost consumers as much as $50 billion. Settling a decade of differences, Congress was expected to approve this weekend amendments to the Clean Air Act that are intended to clear the sky of smog and harmful fumes by limiting emissions from cars and factories. The chemical, steel, utility and auto industries will bear much of the estimated $30 billion in compliance costs but may have little luck passing them onto customers if a recession causes demand for their products to shrink.
 
All-New Labeling for Food
 Food packaging designers may be in for boom times. In the most sweeping revision of food labeling laws in 20 years, the Senate approved a bill, a version of which has already passed the House, that would require nutritional labeling on all packaged foods and strictly regulate disease-prevention claims on labels. An estimated 40 percent of last year's food product introductions made such promises. Under the bill, which is bound for Presidential approval, manufacturers have two years to relabel products and grocers would be expected within a year to post nutritional information on 20 popular fruits and vegetables.
 
Oil-Price Respite Proves Brief
 Oil prices dropped to their lowest level in weeks on Tuesday, to $28.38 a barrel, on news that Saudi Arabia was mulling concessions to Iraq to end the Persion Gulf stalemate. But crude rose the rest of the week, closing at $33.01 on Friday, driven up by President Bush's plan to deploy 100,000 more troops.
 
Milken Takes the Fifth
 Michael Milken may have decided to quit while he was ahead. Rather than taking the stand in the hearing ordered by Judge Kimba Wood to help decide his sentence for six felonies, Mr. Milken took the Fifth Amendment on Friday, bringing the two-week hearing to a close. The hearing cast doubt on the probity of Mr. Milken's "junk bond" operation at Drexel Burnham Lambert, but whether Mr. Milken ever traded on insider information is murky.
 
 S.&L. Examiners and 'Bandits'
 In further evidence that regulators played a part in the downfall of the savings industry, a former examiner at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle testified in Congressional hearings last week that she was harassed and dismissed for questioning $300,000 in bonuses paid to management by the Far West Federal Bank, the largest savings institution in Portland, Ore., which is now in Government hands. An official of the Office of Thrift Supervision said the evidence backed up her position.
Described as "one of the biggest savings and loan bandits" by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Jarrett E. Woods was indicted last Thursday on 37 charges of bank fraud, misuse of funds and conspiracy in connection with one of the largest bank failures in Texas, Western Savings Association. Federal regulators had filed a civil lawsuit against Mr. Woods, its former owner, seeking $560 million in damages, one of the largest sums sought by the Government from a savings executive.
 
INTERNATIONAL


 
 
R.T.C. Finds Japanese Investor
 Despite the skepticism among the Japanese about investing in the United States and the decline in the fortunes of Japan's financial firms as the stock market there has slipped, the American subsidiary of the Nomura Securities Corporation is negotiating to purchase $1 billion in commercial loans from the Resolution Trust Corporation. If the deal is finalized, it would represent the largest sale yet by the agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout and one of its first involving a Japanese investor.

 
 
Philips Keeps Trimming
 N.V. Philips is continuing to slim down in an effort to become a more nimble opponent for the Japanese. The Dutch electronics conglomerate announced a bold plan to eliminate by year-end up to 45,000 jobs, or 16 percent of its work force. The company also said it would pay no dividend this year and its annual loss would be more than its projected $1.18 billion. A cost-cutting program to trim 10,000 jobs from its work force of 286,000 was already under way before the announcement, and follows another move by Philips to pare itself down: earlier this year, it sold far-flung operations in toothbrush and a garage-door opener manufacturing.

 
 
Little Success in Trade Talks
 President Bush has gone to bat for the American farmer. But Washington's negotiators are striking out in talks aimed at getting trading partners to reduce farm subsidies, as part of a four-year round to liberalize world trade. Division in the European Community on the level of reductions caused the group to miss an Oct. 15 deadline for a proposal, raising the specter that the talks would collapse. Washington was pushing for a 90 percent reduction in subsidies, which it says make it difficult for Americans to compete. But France and Germany refused to shave them by even 30 percent, the level favored by their fellow members.
 
COMPANIES


 
 
Fat Gas Profits? Not Yet

 Price-gouging among gasoline marketers? You'd never suspect it from oil companies' third-quarter results. For most, refining and marketing operations were a hinderance, not a help. Analysts say that honoring the President's request for price restraint at the pump allowed oil companies to recover only about half of their higher crude costs through gasoline price hikes. Companies relying most heavily on outside crude supplies for its refining and marketing operations took the worst hit. They include the two largest oil concerns: the Exxon Corporation, which, without a one-time gain, would have seen quarterly earnings drop slightly, and the Mobil Corporation, whose profits did drop, by nearly 29 percent. Both purchase roughly half of their crude from foreign sources. In contrast, Texaco Inc., which produces more than half of its crude needs, enjoyed a 25 percent rise in earnings.

 
 
UAL's New Spunkiness
 Despite a downturn in travel and an upswing in fuel prices, the UAL Corporation is splurging. After the protracted takeover battle for its United Airlines came to a close early this month, the company placed a $22 billion aircraft order, the biggest ever. And it agreed last week to pay Pan American World Airways $400 million in cash for several vaunted routes from the United States to Europe. If approved by regulatory authorities, the purchase would give United a big lead in Europe over its archrivals, American and Delta. United's renewed spunk has perked up its stock, which had dropped to the mid-$80 after the failed buyout bid but closed Friday at $96.75. And UAL was among the best-performing airlines in the third quarter, noticing only a slight fall in earnings while other carriers took losses.

 
 
Continental Sheds Top Brass
 The Pan Am Corporation is hurting for cash. But it is the parent of Continental Airlines that apparently brushed with bankrupty last week. Although it has been beaten down by unexpected losses, rising fuel prices and a payment of $80.5 million to the pension fund of its sister, Eastern Airlines, Continental decided against filing bankruptcy proceedings after preparing the documents. But another overhaul took shape. In an apparent attempt to clear the decks of close allies of Frank Lorenzo, its former chairman, Continental said four top executives would leave the company.

 
 
Citicorp, Paying Dearly
 Concerns over mounting loan losses are exacting a toll on banking companies' cost of capital. Citicorp agreed to pay higher dividend rates on its preferred stock to keep its auctions from failing. Monday, it paid 9.4 percent on a $75 million issue, nearly three percentage points higher than that paid at an auction earlier this month, before Citicorp released disappointing third-quarter earnings. On Thursday, the bank agreed to another three-point jump, to 12.5 percent on a $100 million issue -- about double the yield paid by one of the strongest banks, J.P. Morgan.
Weighty loan losses are forcing some banks to part with their most precious assets. The MNC Financial Corporation of Baltimore, Maryland's biggest banking company, was forced to put its $1 billion credit card business, the nation's fourth largest, up for sale to offset losses. Pining to expand in plastic, industrialist like A.T.&T. and General Electric may try to pick up the prize.

 
 
The Reds' Win is CBS's Loss
 The Cincinnati Reds' four-game sweep over the Oakland Athletics in the World Series may saddle CBS with a loss of $100 million or more in the first year of its high-priced, four-year, $1.06 billion baseball contract. The series ran shorter than the six-game average, depriving CBS of advertising revenues.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A New Test Of Buffett's Reputation

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
JUST when oil prices started to fall last week, the United States Government began talking tough and hinting of a possible military action to liberate Kuwait, pushing crude quotes higher again. And as the week ended, a deal to raise taxes significantly seemed to be near.
With actions like that, one could conclude that the Government wants a recession. And, from President Bush's perspective, why not? The 1981-82 recession cost the Republicans some Congressional seats but it paved the way for an economic recovery that made Ronald Reagan the most popular President in a generation. 
 With that last recession having ended eight years ago, many on Wall Street now worry that the excesses built up since then -- especially in debts that will not be paid back -- make a new recession potentially a very damaging event. Real estate -- the most popular of assets for much of the last decade -- now is seen as a curse that could bring down the American banking industry.
Wall Street's worries last week came through both in the movement of the Dow Jones industrial average, which declined 84.65 points to 2,436.14, and in the further erosion of confidence in bank securities. The flight from most New York money center banks -- J. P. Morgan is a conspicuous exception -- took on a new impetus just as the banks were having their annual convention in Orlando, Fla., down the road from Disney World. Unfortunately, investors are beginning to realize that Mickey Mouse cartoons have sometimes been closer to reality than were bank estimates of possible loan losses.
Citicorp, the biggest bank holding company in the country, was forced to pay a 12.5 percent dividend to find willing owners of its preferred shares. Considering the tax advantages of preferred stock, that means corporations buying the shares are demanding the equivalent of a taxable 17 percent yield, a "junk" rate if ever there was one.
Into that glum setting came word that Warren Buffett, the boss of Berkshire Hathaway, a student of the legendary Ben Graham and a man renowned for investment judgment, was loading up on shares of Wells Fargo, a California bank that is far from being a basket case but whose stock price has nonetheless fallen sharply amid fears of losses from its aggressive real estate lending. Mr. Buffett's companies now have almost 10 percent of Wells Fargo's stock.
Almost by definition, the best time to buy is also the most difficult time to make the decision. It is when things look bleakest, when almost everyone is bearish, that prices hit bottom. For the entire stock market, that time may not have arrived yet. But in bank securities, it is to be fervently hoped that a bottom is near, if not at hand, and that Mr. Buffett, who built his reputation by buying insurance and newspaper stocks at a time when few wanted them, will be proved right again.
The alternative conclusion is that the banking industry will go the way of the savings and loans, becoming a Government ward. If that is to happen, it is hard to be bullish about anything.

A Company Gives Up on New York

BYLINE: By CHARLES L. SCHULTZE; Charles L. Schultze, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration.

 BODY:
THE budget agreement that is now working its way toward enactment is a good one. It will not achieve all that is claimed for it, but it will make substantial cuts in the deficit that are real. The tax increases and some of the entitlement cuts will be locked into substantive law, and, barring a shooting war in the Persian Gulf, future defense spending is likely to be less than what the budget agreement promises.
We Americans are finally facing up, if only partially, to correcting a decade of public and private profligacy, during which the country borrowed massively at home and abroad to finance a consumption boom. As a nation we now save and invest only 3 percent of our national income. Our economic future depends on raising national saving, mainly through getting rid of the Federal budget deficit and ultimately turning it into a surplus. The budget agreement is a major step in that direction. 
 The magnitude of the sacrifices the American people have now been asked to make is actually quite small. The sum of all the tax increases, about which such a titanic struggle has been waged, will amount to something like seven-tenths of 1 percent of national income. Yet listening to months of rhetoric about "fairness" -- on the part of the Democrats -- and "the need to preserve incentives," on the part of the Republicans, made it seem that the country was engaged in some massive economic restructuring, a perestroika of our own.
The progressivity of the latest tax agreement makes it better than the original proposal. And establishing the principle that progressive income taxes are not off-limits when taxes have to be raised is worthwhile.
But most of the political fights that erupted were not worth bringing the whole agreement to the brink of defeat. Reducing the gasoline tax increase from 12 cents to 5 cents a gallon, for example, will mean a savings of only about $1.40 a week for the average family. Inequality in the United States has indeed increased over the past 15 years, but the tax code was not the principal culprit.
The Republican position in the recent squabble was particularly silly. Does anyone really believe that American productivity and efficiency will be seriously affected by whether upper-income executives and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs pay a top-bracket rate of 28, 31 or 33 percent? Do our German and Japanese competitors appear to be severely handicapped by the fact that one has a top income tax rate of 53 percent and the other of 50 percent? Only in the heat of an ideological passion, could grown people make so much of so little.
The payoff from reducing the budget deficit will not be immediate. It will not rescue us from the recession we are apparently entering. Rather, it will come from larger national savings and investment, whose benefits in the form of higher economic growth will show up only gradually.
It is terribly hard to muster political support to do painful things for such subtle and distant goals. And for eight years the country has had two popular Presidents who have not only failed to use their office to mobilize public opinion toward that goal, but have actively blocked the modest tax increases that were obviously necessary to reach it.
Small wonder that the Congressional troops concentrated on bickering about how the costs were to be divided. The bully pulpit had never been used to educate the troops' constituents on what the benefits would be.
In the end what is truly remarkable is the fact that the system ended up doing the responsible thing. President Bush deserves credit for reversing his stand on taxes. But the real heroes are the Congressional leadership. Ultimately, even the troops in the trenches look as if they will respond with an act of political courage. The majority will vote for a tax increase two weeks before an election. It is not such a bad system after all.

Opportunities in Soviet Disintegration

BYLINE: By VLADIMIR KVINT; Vladimir Kvint, the U.S.S.R. Professor of Political Economy, resides in Manhattan and advises companies about doing business in the Soviet Union.

 BODY:
DESPITE the Soviet Parliament's approval of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan to create a market economy, the Soviet Union will not live to celebrate its 70-year anniversary in 1992. The Soviet Union's political and economic crises are intensifying and if the forces of disintegration continue -- as I expect they will -- the Union will come apart. By 1992, there will be no country called the Soviet Union.
In place of the old Soviet Union, new states will appear. These states will welcome foreign investment. For Europe and the United States, these resource-rich republics could become the new Klondike. But to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise as the Soviet Union disintegrates, investors will have to think in terms of several diverse markets -- not one country. 
 My own assessment, as a regional economist, is that the safest place to invest will continue to be the Russian Republic. Even without its empire, Russia will remain the largest country in the world. Siberia alone, which is a part of Russia, is bigger than the United States. Russia contains not only 92 percent of the Soviet Union's oil, but also 85 percent of its natural resources. According to my calculations, it would cost one-fifth to one-third as much to transport oil to the United States from Russia as from the Middle East.
But Russia is not homogeneous. That is why the degree of political and economic risk varies depending on the territory.
The region of Russia called Dagestan, on the Caspian Sea, is largely Muslim, but is also home to 36 other ethnic groups. Dagestan is very stable and open to foreign investment, unlike its neighbor, Azerbaijan, where ethnic fighting is rampant.
Moscow and Leningrad are attractive places to invest. In the Soviet Far East, the Sakhalin and Primorski territories near Japan are especially attractive as markets. Political risk there is minimal and a basic infrastructure is already in place. The Pacific region in general is becoming the center of world business activity and the Russian Far East, with its tremendous resources, can play a major role.
So far, the Parliament of Russia is the most full-blooded and reliable in the Soviet Union. Next comes the government of the Ukraine and then, with more reservations, the governments of Estonia and Latvia. Guarantees coming from the other Republics are not worth much now.
The 1990's will see the re-emergence of Russian companies, after nearly 70 years. The 1990's will also see these companies become integrated into the world economy through alliances with foreign companies. What will be created, as these changes unfold, is a new nation, devoid of empire, but with the potential for creating abundant wealth.

The Global Strategy of Fiona Biggs

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
ON Aug. 3, Fiona Biggs received the news in a routine 1:55 A.M. telephone call from her Japanese stockbroker: Iraq had invaded Kuwait. After she hung up, she stumbled over the freeweight equipment and the Reuters and fax machines that crowd the bedroom of her New York City apartment and sat in the kitchen impatiently until 4:30, when the European markets opened. Then she quickly sold all of her British stocks and bought shares in Royal Dutch Petroleum.
This bet paid off handsomely, like many others she has placed in the past. In 1989, her first full year managing the $25 million Dreyfus Strategic World Investing fund, and in 1990, too, Ms. Biggs far surpassed the other 10 global flexible funds. Global flexible funds invest in stocks, bonds and money-market securities, with at least 25 percent of the portfolio invested outside the United States. 
 So far this year, the 28-year-old Ms. Biggs has posted a 5.4 percent gain while other global flexible funds have lost nearly 7 percent. For the 12 months ended Oct. 11, her fund was up 7.3 percent while her competitors as a group posted a 5.6 percent drop and all stock funds plunged 15.3 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
 "She's had a great deal of success," said John A. Rekenthaler, a senior analyst at Morningstar Inc., Chicago-based mutual fund consultants. "You can't argue with the results for the last two years."
Ms. Biggs's own philosophy is simple: "I don't like to gamble with my money or with my investors'," she says. To that end, she operates her fund as a defensive play, using hedging and trading techniques to minimize her downside risk, techniques that force her to move nimbly across different markets and to maneuver through a world of risk and opportunity. Unlike many of her rivals, who often just stick to stock and bond picking, she sells stock short, leverages her portfolio and invests in interest rate futures contracts or stock index futures.
How did she build this year's spectacular record? "I was cautious on the U.S. and Japan all year," she said. She bought companies with strong balance sheets and sold short the shares of cyclical companies with weak balance sheets. (In a short sale, you sell stock that you do not own, hoping to deliver the promised shares by buying the stock later at a lower price.)
She began 1990 with 50 percent of the fund in cash -- the smallest cash position that she's had all year. The rest was divided among stocks: 5 percent in Japan, 25 percent in Europe and 20 percent in the United States. Sensing a free fall in the Japanese market because of the weakening yen, she sold all the Japanese stock by the beginning of February and then began to buy put warrants on the Nikkei index, a proxy for the Japanese stock market. (A put warrant is an option to sell stocks at a set price for a set period.)
In May, concerned about Japanese liquidity problems and how they could affect the American market and about America's troubled real estate and financial services sectors, she sold some American holdings short, primarily leveraged companies and those in financial services and consumer goods. In August, after the Iraqi invasion, she sold European stocks, bringing that sector to about 7 percent, from 25 percent, and raised cash to nearly 65 percent. "I thought the invasion would have a short-term negative effect on worldwide stock markets," she said.
The fund can buy bonds but she held only small amounts of American debt for short periods in 1990. Why didn't she tap into the fat returns of foreign short-term paper? "I should have, but I didn't," she said. "We had a lot of other bets already." Her biggest oversight, she thinks, was not selling more Japanese stocks short because "that was the most obvious way to make money this year."
Ms. Biggs, who earned an M.B.A. from New York University and joined Dreyfus in 1987, splits her work day between her Dreyfus office and her four-bedroom Manhattan apartment, navigating markets that operate in different time zones. She usually sleeps between 10 P.M. and 5 A.M., with two wake-up calls from stockbrokers -- one at 1:55 from Japan, the other at 4:30 from Europe.
She has a dour view of things to come, believing the "U.S. market will continue to decline, reaching 2200 or lower." She now has 63 percent in cash, 35 percent in American and European stocks, and the rest in short positions and Japanese put warrants. In mid-October, she closed out many of her Japanese short positions "because the strength of the yen is a new positive for that market."
 Her American stock holdings are split among food, drug and energy companies. Her biggest position is Beckton Dickinson, a Franklin Lakes, N.J.-based medical supply company. Another favorite: Philip Morris. Her European portion is split between food and capital goods companies. She likes Nestle, the Swiss food conglomerate; Siemens, a German industrial conglomerate, and C.G.E., a French transportation, communications and energy company.
Many of her hunches have proved right and depending on how much money was at risk, she probably has pulled in profits. So how much is she paid for her acumen? She won't say.

 
 
THE WIDENING YIELD SPREAD ON 'JUNK'

 AFTER peaking in February, the spread in yields between "junk bond" funds and corporate A-rated bond funds drifted downward until August. At that point, the trend reversed as the yield spread neared the February high, and in September, surpassed that high.
What happened? The last time there was a big jump in the yield spread -- late in 1989 -- Drexel Burnham Lambert, the dominant junk bond force, was unraveling and there were growing concerns about whether there would be a market for junk issues. This time, investors are worried about whether companies, unable to meet their huge interest payments during a recession, will default. Indeed, junk bond defaults are already at record levels and show no signs of slowing. Yield spreads are likely to stay wide, then, as investors demand high rewards for assuming high risk.

HEADLINE: The News Strike Shows Shifting Labor Relations

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
With nonunion workers crossing picket lines in large numbers, the strike at The Daily News has underscored the new realities for labor and management in New York City. Labor experts say these realities illustrate why, 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, the strike would not have unfolded the way it has in what was long considered to be one of the nation's last big union towns.
"There are no union towns any more," said Esther Fuchs, a professor of political science at Barnard College, who is completing a book on labor relations in New York and Chicago. She and other labor specialists, as well as some labor leaders, said that changing public attitudes have played the largest part in why that is so. The air-traffic controllers' strike in 1981, crushed by President Reagan, gave credibility to antiunion attitudes that had been growing a long time. 
 "Since the controllers' strike," said Theodore W. Kheel, a lawyer and longtime adviser to unions at The News, "employers have been emboldened to take more and more militant stands."
Management's increasing boldness at once reflected and reinforced the perception that unions no longer seemed focused on safeguarding workers from unfair management, but on fulfilling the economic desires of an increasingly well-paid work force.
"It's more dramatic in New York, as everything is more dramatic in New York," said Professor Fuchs, "and the old coalitions die hard. Unions are still part of the politcal fabric of New York City, but I would easily guess that the public is not going to be particularly distressed that The Daily News is considered to be antiunion in this particular dispute."
Dick Netzer, a professor at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, said newspapers waited longer than other businesses to try to put unions on the defensive. "It's inconceivable to me that a newspaper employer would have been this tough 10 or 12 years ago," he said.
At The News, where labor had long said it believed that it was on reasonably good terms with management, the more strident approach was also built on economic necessity. Despite New York's boom of the 1980's, The News was a losing operation. In trying to sell the paper in 1982, management acknowledged that the paper was awash in red ink. Circulation declined by more than 700,000 copies a day between 1983 and 1990.
 
Victim of Demographics
 The News's increasingly weak position forced the unions to react in a way that was almost the polar opposite of what was familiar to them."Twenty years ago," said Mr. Kheel, "unions struck at drop of a hat. Here, the union was determined not to."
Newspaper analysts say The News was a victim of changing demographics. "Large numbers of the people who were traditional readers of The Daily News moved up and out and ceased being readers of daily newspapers at all," Professor Netzer said.
The changing work place was more of a factor in the erosion of union support. The city's old manufacturing base, which once provided vast numbers of unionized jobs, gave way to nonunionized information and financial services. "Twenty or 30 years ago, you could find a labor movement with clout, backbone and visibility," said Sumner Rosen, formerly a high-ranking organizer at District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "That's gone."
Unions now account for less than 20 percent of the working population nationally, labor specialists say.
Now, with the New York economy on shakier ground and the city threatening to lay off more than 30,000 workers, there is, Professor Fuchs said, little public support for striking workers like those at The News.
"The general public tenor is, 'If I'm not protected, so why should you be?' " she said. "There are hundreds if not thousands of people waiting on line to take blue-collar jobs, so the ability of unions to rally people in their favor has declined."

HEADLINE: U.S. Says It Sent No Signals To Expel Lebanese General

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has taken the view that while Syria's ouster of Gen. Michel Aoun from the presidential palace in Beirut was particularly violent, it was the only solution that offered any promise of a more stable Lebanon.
Questions have arisen on what signal the United States may have sent Damascus before the confrontation between Syrian troops and supporters of the renegade general. About 750 Lebanese and Syrian soldiers and civilians were killed in the fighting two weeks ago, and unconfirmed reports say that dozens of the dead were executed after they surrendered, or were victims of revenge killings long after combat ceased. 
 Administration officials, still smarting from accusations that they sent the wrong message to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and may have inadvertently encouraged him to invade Kuwait, say they went out of their way to notify Damascus that the United States did not endorse a Syrian military operation to oust General Aoun.
But officials make clear that they did not flash any red lights at Damascus either, since the Syrian-supported Lebanese Government was inviting the Syrians to remove General Aoun. He had entrenched himself in the Presidential Palace in Baabda and refused to stand aside for the legally elected President, Elias Hrawi, or to recognize the constitutional changes approved by the Lebanese Parliament last year in Taif, Saudi Arabia, that put Lebanon's Muslims and Christians on a more equal political footing.
 
'Not Approving Anything'
 "We had conversations with both the Lebanese and the Syrians," a senior Administration official said. "We made clear that we were not giving anyone a green light. We did not give any red lights either. You couldn't, because the Lebanese Government was inviting the Syrians to take action. We just made clear that we were not approving anything."
But the question Administration officials asked themselves, he said, was "whether the fighting might lead to a process where they begin to put Humpty Dumpty back together again."
"The process was dead in the water before," he said. "Now at least there is a glimmer of hope."
As Lebanon's Ambassador to Washington, Nassib Lahoud, put it: "The Lebanese Government has neither sought nor received any green lights from the United States. We asked for Syrian intervention in accord with the Taif agreement, which allows us to seek their assistance in recovering Lebanon's sovereignty."
 
A Protest in Washington
 That view is not shared by some groups in the United States that view General Aoun as a Lebanese patriot who was fighting to keep the country independent of Syria. The National Alliance of Lebanese-Americans demonstrated across from the White House on Friday, carrying placards reading: "Middle East Double Standard. Iraq Invades Kuwait: Outrage. Syria Invades Lebanon: Silence."
But far from creating any friction between the Administration and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, the Syrian effort to oust General Aoun seems to have added momentum to the improvement in relations resulting from Syria's commitment of troops to the American-led coalition against Iraq.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, in his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Oct. 18, was asked to comment on relations between Washington and Damascus.
"We are appreciative of the role that Syria is playing in support of the international coalition in the gulf," he said. "Its commitment of troops to that effort is particularly welcome. We would like to think that this could lead to a more constructive Syrian role on other issues."
He added: "I spent a fair amount of time in my visit with President Assad in Damascus emphasizing the fact that we have some serious differences with the Syrian Government, pertaining primarily to the issue of terrorism. Better relations between Syria and the United States are really going to depend upon their being willing to take action to curb some of the activities of terrorist groups."
 
Refusing to Expel Terrorists
 The pro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command, is suspected of involvement in the December 1989 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, in which 189 Americans were killed. The Syrians have refused to expel the group from Damascus.
Representative Edward F. Feighan, Democrat of Ohio, then asked Mr. Baker for his attitude on the loss of life in the Syrian operation in Beirut.
Mr. Baker responded: "We've condemned violence in Lebanon for a long time. Most recently, we argued against that in President Bush's meeting on the 29th of September with the Prime Minister of Lebanon in New York, so suggestions that somehow we've given a green light for this are wrong. That's not the case. I do think we should recognize that Syria was there at the request of the legitimate Government of Lebanon, a Government that we recognize and a Government that we support."
 
Demanding His Trial
 The Hrawi Government has said that General Aoun, who has taken refuge in the French Embassy in Beirut, and his aides should stand trial for crimes against the state, as well as on charges of embezzling as much as $75 million in public funds.
France is refusing to turn General Aoun over for trial, and the United States is quietly advising the Lebanese Government to let him go and focus its energies on reconstruction.
After 15 years of civil war, no one in the Administration is prepared to predict that Lebanon has finally turned the corner, but there is a sense that it now has probably the best opportunity in years to achieve some stability. This is a result of several factors: the relative weakness of the militias, Iraq's preoccupations elsewhere that limit its capacity for trouble-making in Beirut, the new Constitution that divides power more equitably between Moslems and Christians and the fact that the Syrian-backed Government appears to be bringing all of Beirut under its control.
Much depends, though, on whether the Syrians will continue to support the Hrawi Government fully or will, as they have in the past, play off one Lebanese faction against another to keep them all off balance and dependent on Damascus.
Another major factor is whether Lebanon's Shiite Muslims, who are the single largest religious group but whose economic and political shares were always the smallest, will be made to feel that they have a stake in a "new Lebanon."

Kremlin Signals Hope in Standoff By Sending an Envoy to Baghdad

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The Soviet Union indicated today that it was mounting a new effort to end the standoff in the Persian Gulf and hinted that it hoped for some progress soon.
The Soviet Union abruptly postponed a Security Council vote on a new resolution pressing for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, saying that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had sent a special emissary to Baghdad for talks with President Saddam Hussein. 
 Mr. Gorbachev, commenting while in Spain on an official visit, said: "There are some signs the top leadership in Iraq has understood that a solution cannot be found through ultimatums. Perhaps I am wrong. In the next days things will become clearer."
The mission by Mr. Gorbachev's personal envoy, Yevgeny M. Primakov, marks his second visit to Iraq this month.
"His mission is not finished," Mr. Gorbachev said at a news conference in Madrid. "The Soviet Union has this possibility of finding a solution."
 
Gorbachev to Visit Paris
 Mr. Gorbachev is to fly to France on Sunday, where he is expected to discuss the gulf situation with President Francois Mitterand at a dinner in the evening. On Friday night, a spokesman for President Mitterrand denied any knowledge of a letter rumored to have been sent by President Hussein to the Mr. Mitterrand.
Unconfirmed reports in London and Paris suggested that Mr. Hussein had sent a letter to Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Gorbachev saying he was willing to enter discussions on the future of Kuwait.
At the United Nations, the Soviet representative, Yuli M. Vorontsov, said that Mr. Primakov would meet with President Hussein and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz this weekend.
 
Soviet Hints at Progress
 "We have great hopes for the success of his mission there," he said, adding later, "We all expect he will have very fruitful and important discussions."
He refused to provide further details on the mission.
In a speech at the United Nations last month, the French President sought to tempt President Hussein to give up Kuwait, declaring that withdrawal could lead to a diplomatic settlement of the Palestinian question for which Mr. Hussein could then take political credit.
The hints by the Soviet Union that progress toward resolving the gulf crisis might come soon elicited plenty of skeptical reactions at the United Nations and in Washington.
 
Bush Comments in Hawaii
 The United Nations move by the Soviets clearly caught the United States and other natiions by surprise, and American diplomats at the United Nations left the headquarters building without commenting on it.
In Washington, Bush Administration officials said late today that the Soviets had contacted the State Department to ask for the postponement of the vote.
They said that while the Soviets were not entirely explicit about their motivation, they left the impression that they did not want Mr. Primakov to have to go into a meeting with President Hussein in the wake of yet another Soviet vote imposing sanctions on Baghdad.
The officials noted the Soviets' cooperation with Washington at the United Nations in recent months, but said that pressing for an immediate vote would emphasize their lack of enthusiasm for any kind of Primakov compromise solution.
But at a news conference in Honolulu today, where he was meeting with the leaders of Pacific island nations, President Bush seemed to reflect a trend toward using diplomatic means to get President Hussein out of Kuwait.
 
Bush Sees 'No Softening'
 He knew of the actions in the United Nations, according to his aides, when he said: "In terms of a peaceful solution, I'm told that the economic effects are taking hold. I'm told that he now sees that he's up against a substantial force that clearly could prevail in any battle. So I'm hopeful that there will be a peaceful solution to this question. But there can be no preconditions. There can be no rewarding of aggression."
Asked if he agreed with Mr. Gorbachev's comment in Spain on a new Iraqi attitude, President Bush said: "I have not noticed a softening. But I've heard more kind of little threads of talk of quote, negotiation, unquote. That's all. Maybe that's what President Gorbachev is talking about."
Although optimistic about Mr. Primamakov's forthcoming talks with President Hussein, Ambassador Vorontsov admitted to the Security Council that past efforts to find a settlement have got nowhere, saying, "Reports from the Persian Gulf show Iraq has not given a positive response to efforts by many countries to settle the conflict."
Ambassador Vorontsov also said Moscow fully supports the new council resolution tightening sanctions on Iraq and plans to join a majority of members in voting for it next Monday.
Earlier this week, Ambassador Vorontsov told nonaligned Security Council members that Mr. Primakov had found no evidence that President Hussein is prepared to give up Kuwait when he visited Baghdad earlier this month, as he sought to persuade them to support the council resolution.
The Security Council's current President, Sir David Hannay of Britain, was openly skeptical about reports of a new Soviet peace initiative, describing them as "quite speculative."
He said there was "no indication that anything is cooking at all," pointing out that Iraq has consistently refused to obey the Security Council's call for total and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. He also recalled that the Soviet Union fully supports the new resolution against Iraq and intends to vote for it on Monday.
"I dont't think you should read very much into this short postponement," he said.
Kuwait's United Nations representative, Mohammad A. Abdulhassan, was equally skeptical. He stressed that the Soviet Union had little negotiating room because it is bound by Security Council resolution 660, which demands Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal.
"I doubt that this effort will lead anywhere," he said.
The Soviet Union's sudden request for a postponement threw the Security Council into confusion this afternoon, just as it was about the adopt the new resolution. It appeared to catch everyone by surprise including the Soviet delegation, who had been negotiating the new resolution throughout Thursday night, all day Friday and until 2:30 this morning.
An Arab diplomat said he believed President Hussein had been resisting a new visit by Mr. Primakov as late as Friday, but then for no clear reason suddenly changed his mind.
The new resolution the council will vote on next is intended to increase pressure on President Saddam Hussein by calling on all nations to begin collecting evidence of Iraqi human-rights violations in Kuwait and preparing their financial claims against the regime for losses suffered as a result of the invasion.
The resolution also demands an immediate end to Iraqi hostage-taking, looting and pillaging in Kuwait, calls on Baghdad to resupply the few remaining foreign embassies there with food and water, and warns President Hussein that if he fails to obey those orders, the Security Council will "take futher measures under the Charter."
But in deference to a determined campaign by four of its seven non-aligned members, the Security Council is also planning to authorize the United Nations Secretary General to make another attempt to find a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis.
The Bush Administration has toned down the reference to a negotiated settlement, however, and early this morning even rejected language already accepted by the United States representative, Thomas R. Pickering, because it felt the passge in the resolution put too much emphasis on the case for a diplomatic solution.
The expectation is that it will be overwhelmingly approved if there is no dramatic breakthrough in the gulf before next Monday, with diplomats predicting that 14 of the Council's 15 members will support it. Only Cuba is expected to abstain or vote against.
The strong support the resolution now enjoys is widely seen as reaffirming the impressive unity the Security Council has displayed in its handling of the gulf crisis so far, following some signs of strain who much emphasis on the case for a diplomatic solution.

The strong support the resolution now enjoys is widely seen as reaffirming the impressive unity the Security Council has displayed in its handling of the gulf crisis so far, following some signs of strain when Yemen, Cuba, Malaysia and Colombia urged the council to adopt a different text that called for a negotiated settlement.
But the threat of a serious split was overcome by combining both points of view into a single document that authorizes another peace initiative by the Secretary General while simultaneously increasing international pressure on Baghdad.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
Lawmakers Agree to Curb Exploration for Offshore Oil

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators agreed today to keep vast tracts of coastal waters off limits to oil and gas drilling, rejecting arguments that domestic fuel production should be increased because of the crisis in the Middle East.
But Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said he would recommend that President Bush veto the measure if it cleared the full House and Senate. Because it is attached to the 1991 spending bill for the Interior Department, it is not clear what effect a veto would have on other operations of the department.
In the past, Cabinet members have recommended that Presidents veto bills with similar provisions, but the threat has never been carried out, and appears unlikely to be this time. 
The lawmakers' decision was the first clear sign that oil disruptions caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait had not reversed the decadelong aversion to offshore drilling in Congress.
 
Jubilation and Dismay
 It drew expressions of jubilation from environmental groups and dismay from the oil industry.
"I am bouncing off the ceiling," said a happy Lisa Speer, a coastal expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. But Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said in a statement that he was dismayed.
Steven Goldstein, the spokesman for the Interior Department, said the Administration was "extremely disappointed." The decision can only lead to more imports, Mr. Goldstein said, adding, "If the image of troops over in Kuwait that people see in the nightly news and the morning newspapers is not strong enough to change people, then I am not sure what is."
 
House Position Wins Out
 The decision came at a meeting to resolve differences between House and Senate bills appropriating money for the Interior Department, which manages the sale of offshore leases to the oil industry. It was not a compromise but a clear decision to accept House positions over a Senate bill that included no such terms.
Although the moratorium on leasing lasts only one year, it will probably be extended in the future, given the decision today in the face of high oil prices and military crisis.
For 10 years, Congress has stymied development of extensive areas off the nation's coasts by refusing, in annual appropriations bills, to allow the Interior Department to conduct lease sales.
In June, President Bush tried to break that pattern by unilaterally imposing a selective set of protections for the West Coast, the Florida Keys, and New England's Georgia Banks in hopes that the restrictions on other areas would then be dropped. The protection would last 10 years but could be reversed by the White House.
Mr. Bush's move, meant in part to help Republican candidates for the governorships of Florida and California, broke from the policy of the Reagan Administration, which had tried to make the entire 1.4-million-acre outer continental shelf available to industry.
 
135 Million Acres Affected
 Before the invasion of Kuwait, the first sign appeared that the Administration's ambitions would be thwarted, when Congress put restrictions on drilling off the coast of North Carolina.
Today's action is much more extensive, affecting 135 million acres of the continental shelf and significantly expanding the area protected by Mr. Bush's unilateral decision last June.
The oil industry had opposed Mr. Bush's earlier action, and expressed dismay at the latest development.
"Given the situation in the world today, where our supply of fuel is threatened and we are asking foreign producers to increase their output of oil to help the world, it is disturbing that Congress acted to close off huge supplies of oil and gas off our shores that could help our energy security and would be produced in an environmentally sound way," said Mr. DiBona of the petroleum industry group.
But Ms. Speer, the environmental activist, said, "Opening these areas is not going to solve either the immediate problem or the long term problem."
She said that the restrictions would affect areas containing about 2 percent of the nation's economically recoverable oil and gas reserves, and that even if leasing resumed it would take years to develop wells.
The areas that have been put off limits, she acknowledged, contain reserves that could easily be produced, and in amounts that would be profitable to individual oil companies. But she said the bulk of offshore drilling, in the western Gulf of Mexico near Texas and Louisiana, is unrestricted.
Aside from the areas protected by Mr. Bush's action this summer, the Congressional action would restrict leasing or drilling in the Bristol Bay, Alaska, where it would extend the current delay on leasing and exploration and seek a report on the potential impacts of a catastrophic spill there and in Florida's eastern Gulf of Mexico, where it would delay for one year preparatory steps leading up to a sale of leases off Florida's Gulf coast.

HEADLINE: 14 of 15 Jersey Lawmakers Reject Federal Budget Plan

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
With New Jersey's huge tax increases -- and raging taxpayer revolt -- uppermost in their minds, 12 of the state's 13 members of the House of Representatives voted early yesterday against the Federal deficit-reduction plan, as did both its Senators last night.
Representatives said their votes reflected concerns about the economic strains and political repercussions of Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion in increases in state income, sales and excise taxes. 
 "It's clear evidence of the reaction to the Florio tax package," said Representative Marge S. Roukema, Republican of Ridgewood. "There is a tax revolt going on in New Jersey of major proportions, and this plan will only add to it."
Although most House Democrats voted for the budget plan, Representative William J. Hughes, Democrat of Ocean City, said the party's leadership did not try to sway New Jersey Democrats from their opposition to the measure.
"Everyone knew we had a unique situation because of the Florio package," Mr. Hughes said. "It was probably one of the most difficult votes we had to make."
 
Courter Supports Measure
 In fact, the only House member from New Jersey to vote for the plan was the man whom Mr. Florio defeated in last year's race for governor, Representative Jim Courter, Republican of Hackettstown. Mr. Courter is not running for re-election.
Mr. Courter could not be reached for comment, but many of his colleagues in the delegation attributed his vote to his close ties to the Bush Administration.
"The one person to vote in favor of this bill is the one person who is not going to come back to deal with the practical application of this budget," said Representative Frank J. Guarini, Democrat of Jersey City.
The state's two Democratic Senators, Frank R. Lautenberg and Bill Bradley, opposed the measure. Mr. Bradley, who is up for re-election on Nov. 6, said in a statement that the final agreement was an improvement over the earlier versions but still reflected "a mistaken version of our nation's priorities" for the next five years by failing to take advantage of reduced military needs.
The tax increases in the Federal budget plan duplicate many of the increases approved in June for New Jersey, Ms. Roukema and other representatives say.
"People in New Jersey have been hit with an increase in excise taxes, an increase in the sales tax and a doubling of the state income tax," said Representative Matthew J. Rinaldo, Republican of Union. "Imposing additional Federal taxes on this state tax burden on the residents of New Jersey would be unconscionable, in my view."
 
Boat Builders Affected
 In particular, New Jersey Representatives cited the Federal plan's elimination of some itemized deductions and personal exemptions. New Jerseyans with higher incomes could be faced with one of the highest tax rates in the nation, they said.
The plan affects New Jersey residents in both general and specific ways. Like residents of other states where housing costs are high, New Jersey residents will be penalized more by the limits on deductions for state and local property taxes than residents of states where real-estate prices are lower.

HEADLINE: New York Fiscal Woe Doubted as Talks Stall

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
At the core of the stalled New York City municipal labor talks is the union leaders' growing distrust of the claims being made about the city's financial plight.
Union leaders acknowledge that the city has a financial problem, but they are dubious about its extent. In their eyes, the city's credibility is undermined by the discrepancies in revenue estimates and by work-force reduction warnings that have jumped in the last two weeks from 15,000 to 53,000. 
 After a decade of dire financial predictions that never materialized, union officers are skeptical that the problems are as stark as portrayed.
Public officials and fiscal watchdog groups insist they are not crying wolf about plummeting revenues and the specter of mass layoffs. But the unions say they have heard that song before, particularly from Mayor Edward I. Koch in the 1980's.
 
'Wacky' Projections
 "Mayor Koch always cried wolf," said Stanley Hill, executive director of the 140,000-member District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
"Past history has shown their projections are way, way out -- wacky," Mr. Hill said. "Now, my God, every day the figures are changing. We know the situation is not good, but we feel very strongly there is still money there to fund the contract without bankrupting the city."
Negotiations with two major unions intensified 12 days ago but have so far failed to yield agreements. Talks continued Friday night at Gracie Mansion.
Throughout the 1980's, budget gap predictions were an annual routine. They ranged from $237 million to $870 million. But those budget years ended with handsome surpluses, ranging from $288 million to $570 million.
Felix G. Rohatyn regularly criticized labor settlements, decrying each raise as excessive. He spoke as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a financing agency that helped the city recover from the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's.
The current gloomy predictions remind union leaders most strongly of 1982. As the nation slipped into a recession, falling tax revenues prompted Mr. Rohatyn to call for scaling back existing contracts, and Mayor Koch prepared for thousands of layoffs. Instead the local economy reversed, revenues rebounded, layoffs were averted and another surplus was recorded.
"You can always say that somebody was overly conservative in the past, and in that case I plead guilty," Mr. Rohatyn said last week. "But that doesn't mean I'm wrong today." This time, he and most other experts say, the city's economy is worse.
The crisis of the mid-70's -- when the city was forced into drastic cuts and layoffs -- left a lurking fear of a relapse. But it also left a legacy of many fiscal safeguards, including projections to warn of possible deficits and prompt early action to prevent them.
Mr. Koch defended the process recently as "a very good system," although he said that the forecasts may err. He and others argued that union leaders knew full well that the projections were of potential problems, not actual deficits.
 
'Crying Wolf'
 Norman Steisel, Mayor David N. Dinkins's first deputy mayor, who also served under Mr. Koch, said that the current problems are real, but that "It's no wonder they are suspicious of the enormity of the problem."
Barry Feinstein, president of the 12,000-member Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who is negotiating with Mr. Hill, said: "Any number of times the former administration would bring us in and say: 'This time, it's really true.' We would say, 'What makes this night different from all others?' On every occasion we were right, and the city was wrong."
Mr. Feinstein called the city budget director, Philip R. Michael, "more full of it than a Christmas turkey." Mr. Michael insists his estimates are sound.
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, an organization financed by businesses, says the current talks are seriously hampered by past oratory and actions.
"The city pleads poverty and shows big deficits, and everybody says, 'Oh, that's the way the game is played,' " Mr. Horton said. "But there are consequences for not being more honest."

HEADLINE: Voters' Unhappiness Aside, Most Incumbents Seem Safe

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The election is still 10 days away, but in much of the country the races are already over, or never even began.
For all the signs of anger among voters, and the near panic among Republican politicians that the budget debacle has brought the wrath of the electorate down on them, most lawmakers are certain of re-election, either because they are unopposed in the balloting on Nov. 6 or because they face an opponent so underfinanced as to be out of contention. 
 About 375 members of the House of Representatives fall into this category, as well as at least 16 senators and 90 percent, or about 5,600, of the state legislators. Four senators, two from each party, and 81 members of the House, 35 Republicans and 46 Democrats, are running with no major party opponent at all. Gary Jacobson, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, said this is the largest group of House members to be unopposed in a general election since the 1950's, when Democrats in the solid South rarely drew a general election opponent.
So, all the discussion in the next 10 days about last-minute campaigning, partisan shifts and voter anger will actually be about battles for a relatively small percentage of the nation's political offices.
"Even if you had some big throw-the-bums-out surge or a huge anti-incumbent trend, you're never going to turn over more than 10 percent of the House seats and 20 percent of the Senate seats that are up," said Charles Black Jr., a senior political adviser to the White House and chief spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
A combination of forces has produced a decline in electoral competition: House and state legislative districts in many places have been drawn in such a way that they are full of supporters of one party or the other, thus making it almost impossible to elect an opposition candidate; the campaign finance system routinely produces incumbents with war chests 10 times as large as their opponents'; political parties are so weak that they cannot effectively recruit candidates, or at least recruit effective candidates, and incumbents are bolstered at home by government-financed staff and mailing privileges.
When the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Representative Beryl Anthony Jr. of Arkansas, was asked this week to list Republican incumbents in the House whom he expected to defeat, he could name only three -- and this in a year when the frustration of voters with government has been described as an "anti-incumbent mood" and Republicans, in particular, seem to be taking the blame for a budget deal that raises taxes and squeezes Medicare.
Mr. Anthony said he preferred to focus his committee's efforts on the seats left vacant by members who retire, die or move on to other ambitions. "We get our wins not by defeating incumbents but by those open seats," he said. But there are only 29 such open seats this year (11 held by Democrats, 18 by Republicans) in a House of 435 members.
 
Political Fatalism
 A kind of political fatalism has developed in which the belief that incumbents are hard to beat begins to fulfill itself. Political strategists concede that in making their plans for this election they did not foresee the volatile mood that voters would be in and the political opportunities this might create.
Many potential challengers in both the House and the Senate, convinced a year ago they could not win, walked away from races they might now do well in. Professor Jacobson, a student of Congressional campaigns, said this year's crop of House challengers is the weakest he has ever seen.
"You have a situation where there might be opportunities to defeat incumbents if there were challengers out there with skills and resources to exploit them," Professor Jacobson said in a telephone interview from California, "But in the absence of challengers with skills and resources to exploit public disaffection with incumbents, here will be few defeated."
 
'Don't Have Real Elections'
 Incumbent politicians argue that the lack of competition generally reflects an electorate which, for all its frustration with government in general, is still basically satisfied with individual representatives.
But critics of the system vehemently disagree. "We're at a point were we don't have a real electoral process," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a lobbying group. "If you don't have real elections, you do not have the basic accountability our political system is based on. This is a major part of the public frustration and backlash. You have a combination of public anger and no real electoral process for it to play out in. That's very dangerous."
Common Cause thinks the solution is stripping the incumbents of their financial advantage through public financing of political campaigns, spending limits and other campaign finance reforms. Others, particularly Republicans, agree there is a lack of political competition but disagree that public financing will change that. Mr. Black argued that in a race between an incumbent and a challenger with roughly equal amounts of money, the incumbent will almost always win because of other advantages, like the way districts are drawn, the incumbent's larger staff and free mail.
 
Change in the South
 The decline in competition is not an across-the-board phenomenon. For one thing, an entire area of the country, the South, is far more competitive than it was 50 years ago, when virtually all elected officials were Democrats.
But even with this change, there are fewer competitive elections now than at the end of World War II. Consider Senate elections won by the incumbent with more than 60 percent of the vote. From 1984 to 1988, 54 percent of incumbents won by that margin; four decades earlier, only 39 percent did.
If the increasing competition in the South is removed, the number of senators from the rest of the country re-elected with more than 60 percent of the vote increased from 22 percent in the 1940's to 55 percent in the 1980's.
This year there are four Senators, an unusually large number, who have no opposition at all from the other major party. They are Sam Nunn of Georgia and David Pryor of Arkansas, both Democrats, and John W. Warner of Virginia and Thad Cochran of Mississippi, both Republicans.
"Nobody wanted to run," said Paul Goldman, chairman of the Democratic Party in Virginia, explaining why Mr. Warner had no Democratic opponent. "I set up a search committee to find someone. They searched for weeks. They couldn't find anyone."
In the 31 other Senate races this year, a dozen senators are what Common Cause describes as "financially unopposed." That is, as of Sept. 30, when financial documents were last filed, they had outraised their opponent by at least 9 to 1.
Money, of course, isn't everything. In Minnesota, Paul Wellstone, a Democrat, has a chance to unseat Senator Rudy Boschwitz, even though he had spent $600,000 and the Senator $6 million as of Sept. 30.
But Senate races in states like Minnesota that do not have highly expensive media markets are considerably more competitive as a group than Senate races in big states or races for the House. For instance, Harry Lonsdale, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Oregon, is having a lot more impact with a $1.5 million campaign than Representative Lynn Martin, the Republican, is having with $6 million in her Senate race in Illinois.
A major factor that has strengthened the hand of House members in recent years is the rising importance of their role as case workers for constituents who want help with Government -- finding a social security check, say, or getting a relative admitted to a veterans hospital. The number of Congressional staff members working in district offices has grown much faster than the number working on Capitol Hill, and the typical member now has about 40 percent of his or her staff working back in the district, as against about 25 percent 15 years ago.
Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee, said this has strengthened the connection between individual members and their districts and weakened the power of national political trends on Congressional midterm elections.
Races for governor remain more competitive. Governors are more visible than either senators or House members and tend to have their image shaped more by news coverage, which they cannot control, and less by newsletters, which they can. Voters also hold them individually more responsible for taxes, spending and the state of their state's economy. But even here several governors, including Mario M. Cuomo, Democrat of New York, and Carroll A. Campbell Jr., Republican of South Carolina, are coasting to re-election because the opposition party could not mount a serious challenge.
In this year of discontent, many poll takers and politicians are predicting that more incumbents will be ousted from office than has been the case. Charles Cook, who monitors Congressional races, said 16 House incumbents are in danger of losing their seats.

HEADLINE: National Party Wins New Zealand Vote; Improved U.S. Ties Sought

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WELLINGTON, New Zealand, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Jim Bolger, a conservative who has pledged to patch up relations with the United States, easily captured the Prime Minister's job today as his National Party won by a landslide in national elections.
The party capitalized on a faltering economy to end six years of rule by the Labor Party in this South Pacific nation of 3.5 million people. 
 Final unofficial results projected that the National Party would capture 68 seats in the 97-member Parliament, with Labor taking 28 and the New Labor Party winning 1. A few seats were close enough that they still could be decided by absentee ballots.
In the campaign, both Labor and the National Party had pledged to continue the anti-nuclear policy that badly frayed military relations with the United States after it took effect in 1984; under the policy, nuclear-powered ships and ships with nuclear weapons were barred from making calls at New Zealand ports.
The National Party, however, has said it seeks some sort of reconciliation with Washington, and Mr. Bolger was welcomed there at a time when other top New Zealand officials were rebuffed.
[A State Department spokesman, Adam Shub, said that the United States welcomed Mr. Bolger's election but that it did not know what kind of reconciliation he might have in mind. The spokesman said the United States looked forward to cooperating with the new Government "on issues of mutual interest such as international trade and the environment."]
In today's voting, the National Party won 49 percent, and Labor 35 percent. The Green Party, a relatively new political group that as part of its policy has no official leader, was third with 7 percent; New Labor drew 5 percent.
The defeated Prime Minister, Mike Moore, had held the post for only two months.
Mr. Bolger, the 54-year-old son of Irish immigrants, immediately spoke of reconciliation. "As far as I'm concerned, from tonight, the politics of inclusion begins," he said.
Several Cabinet ministers were among the Labor casualties.
 
Range of Economic Ills
 Labor had a 56 to 40 majority in the old Parliament, with New Labor holding 1 seat.
The National Party, which suffered a stinging defeat in 1987, has dominated opinion polls the last two years. The party's support has grown as disenchantment with Labor set in over high unemployment, slow growth, high interest rates and other economic woes.
Mr. Moore, 41 years old, took over as Prime Minister when Geoffrey Palmer resigned with polls indicating Labor trailing by 21 points and heading for a landslide loss.
 
'Selling Off the State Silver'
 Labor was dragged down by a sagging economy and its unpopular privatization efforts, which National branded as "selling off the state silver to pay the bills."
The top concern of voters was an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent, the highest since World War II.
David Lange, the Labor Prime Minister who instituted New Zealand's antinuclear policy, resigned 15 months ago, citing health reasons.
The United States cut high-level contacts with New Zealand in 1986 in response to the antinuclear policy and dropped the country from the Anzus military alliance, which also includes Australia.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE IN CONGRESS;
Ambitious Air Pollution Bill Sent to White House

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The Senate granted final Congressional approval today to the 1990 Clean Air Act, a measure that transforms the 20-year-old original law from a path-breaking but narrow statute into an ambitious plan to cut contamination from every sizable source of air pollution in the nation.
The Senate vote, 89 to 10, means the legislation now goes to the White House, which has indicated that President Bush will sign it. 
 Almost everyone who negotiated the final accord agreed that the new legislation is one of the exceptional achievements in the current session of Congress and the most inclusive environmental statute ever approved by Congress. It is the first to tackle an immense environmental problem with equally broad legislation. The first Clean Air Act in 1970 was written on 41 pages; the 1990 act may take up more than 700 pages.
"I'm convinced that people will look back at the 101st Congress and say, 'God bless them,' " said Representative Gerry Sikorski, a Minnesota Democrat who played a major role in developing provisions to end acid rain and to limit air pollution from toxic substances. "I'm not so sure they'll look back at the tax and budget fights. I know they'll remember the clean air legislation."
 
New Ways of Cutting Pollution
 Lawmakers said the measure offers imaginative and, in some cases, experimental provisions to reduce environmental contamination, like economic incentives to polluters that are aimed at gaining greater cooperation from companies.
The legislation will serve as a model for updating in the 1990's the other 1970's-era statutes that form the foundation of the nation's environmental program, the lawmakers said.
The largest economic incentives are in a provision on acid rain. The provision sets an overall annual level of emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants, of 8.9 million tons, by the year 2000. That level is less than the half the current emissions. The measure sets a specific emissions limit on 111 utilities in 22 states. Under this plan, if a utility reduces emissions below the required level, it can sell the difference as a credit to new power plants or plants that are planning expansions. Those plants have to buy the credits to win permission from the Government to emit all their pollution.
The lawmakers said they believe they can meet their goal of cutting emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide by 12 million to 14 million tons annually. The pollution credits will help offset the cost of installing equipment in power plants in the those states.
For instance, a power plant in Ohio, required to release no more than 30,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a year by the year 2000, has the option to install equipment that would reduce its emissions to 20,000 tons. That plant could then sell the 10,000-ton difference as a pollution credit to a new plant in Utah. The Utah plant, which expects to produce 10,000 tons of sulfur dioxide each year, would have to buy the 10,000-ton allowance to operate. The incentive, then, for both buyer and seller is to reduce their emissions as low as possible.
The proposal for credits was developed by the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group based in New York and was included in the Clean Air legislation that President Bush submitted to Congress last year.
It is a departure from the traditional environmental requirements, which commanded the environmental agency to develop new limits on pollutants and then required the agency to manage a program to enforce the new controls. Lawmakers hope the new approach will lead to more cooperation from utilities and decrease the burdens on the environmental agency, which has been criticized by Congress for failing to manage or enforce the nation's environmental law aggressively.
"This approach cut the cost of achieving substantial reduction in acid rain pollution in half and made it possible for the President, Congress and environmental groups to negotiate a strong Clean Air bill after 13 years of gridlock," said William J. Roberts, legislative director in Washington for the Environmental Defense Fund.
 
Specifics in Legislation
 The legislation is also more precise in specifying the limits on pollution for industries and businesses and in setting timetables for meeting those limits. No other environmental statute is as precise. The agreement requires oil companies to develop new types of gasoline that burn more cleanly by 1995 and names nine cities, including New York, where the only gasoline available for sale will be the new fuel. Cities are required to reduce concentrations of ozone, a principal component of smog, to a level considered safe, and the act includes penalties if cities miss the deadlines.
By writing the specific requirements into the legislation, lawmakers reduced the role the environmental agency would play in developing standards. The original Clean Air Act gave the agency such broad discretion to develop new rules and to enforce them that the effectiveness of the old law was severely limited, particularly in controlling toxic pollution from factories.
The original law called on the environmental agency to identify chemicals that were toxic and to set limits on the amounts of these chemicals factories could release into the air. In 20 years, the agency completed work on just seven compounds.
"We have to be more direct and more clear in environmental legislation than we were in the past," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who was one of the most influential negotiators on the measure. "We wanted to minimize the number of things we could leave to the E.P.A.'s discretion because we've seen that the E.P.A. became more interested in protecting polluters than the environment."
Mr. Waxman and other lawmakers were cautious about predicting the success of the new approach. The Environmental Protection Agency is still charged with writing hundreds of new rules and with enforcing many provisions. Environmental leaders noted that hidden within the bill were waivers and exemptions that would reduce its effectiveness.
And industrial executives said they were concerned whether they could meet the new guidelines and about the cost of putting the plan into effect. Various estimates have put the annual bill at $20 billion to $50 billion. Under the best of circumstances, Mr. Waxman said, the nation will not begin to breathe significantly cleaner air until after the turn of the century.
 
Bridging Differences
 The agreement was possible, lawmakers said, because a formula was discovered to bridge the political divisions caused by an environmental threat that has multiple causes, crosses state boundaries and thus puts powerful groups and entire regions at odds.
The most important factor in the new formula, they said, was the overwhelming public concern about the deterioration of the environment and broad popular support for measures to stem that decline, even if those measures resulted in higher costs for cars, electricity and consumer goods.
"The equalizing factor that is unique to the environmental movement is that the American public has said overwhelmingly that they want the environment cleaned up, be it water or air, hazardous wastes or nuclear contamination," said Representative Mike Synar, a Democrat of Oklahoma. Earlier this year, Mr. Synar helped to establish the coalition between environmentalists and industrial leaders that led to agreements on reducing urban smog and toxic air pollution.
A final factor in reaching political compromises, said environmental leaders and industrial executives, is that much more is known about the causes and effects of pollution. And lawmakers, especially House members elected in the mid-1970's and early 1980's are now experts in understanding environmental problems and in developing solutions. Many have also achieved enough prominence and seniority to defend their proposals.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
GAS PRICE PROTEST CRIPPLES HUNGARY

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Angry taxi drivers and truck drivers blockaded the streets and bridges of Hungary's capital today to protest the government's decision to raise gasoline prices by 65 percent.
Protesters also snarled traffic in dozens of other cities and towns, closed border crossings and brought much of the nation's economy to a standstill.
The protests began on Friday morning when the new gasoline prices took effect, but the Government has vowed not to bow to the protesters' demands to roll back the increases. 
 "The Government has reached a decision, and it is irrevocable," said Interior Minister Balazs Horvath.
It remained unclear today when the barricades would be removed because Government officials said they would not forcibly end the roadblocks. The blockades usually took the form of taxis and trucks parked to shut bridge and highway entrances, railroad crossings and key intersections in dozens of towns and cities.
 
Army Ordered Not to Interfere
 In his capacity as commander in chief, President Arpad Goncz ordered that the army and its vehicles not be used to settle the dispute. According to MTI, the Hungarian press agency, Budapest's police chief, Sandor Barna, said he would resign if he were ordered to use force against the taxi drivers and truckers.
Political commentators said that after decades of repression under Communism, the Government was loathe to be seen as heavy-handed and stifling democratic expression. To try to end the crisis, the center-right Government was negotiating with representatives of Budapest's 40,000 private taxi drivers.
The public seemed displeased with both sides in the dispute. Many Hungarians criticized the Government for raising gas prices to about $3.80 a gallon, from $2.30 a gallon. That is equal to Western European prices and far higher than American prices, even though the average Hungarian earns less than $50 a week at current exchange rates.
At the same time, many Hungarians condemned the taxi drivers and truckers for causing chaos. Many people could not get to work, many food deliveries could not be made, and there was a rush of panic buying for essentials like break and milk.
 
Hundreds Slept in Cars
 Hundreds of people had to sleep in their cars because the blockades prevented them from reaching home. Army trucks helped bring them food and drink this morning.
For much of Friday and today, five and sometimes all six of Budapest's bridges across the Danube were blocked. The highway to Budapest's main airport was also blockaded much of Friday but was reopened sporadically today. Hundreds of passengers missed their flights, and a charter helicopter service was begun between downtown hotels and the airport.
Government officials said they were forced to raise gasoline prices because the Government has had to start buying large supplies of oil at world prices after the Soviet Union cut its heavily subsidized oil shipments to Hungary by 30 percent this summer. Officials also said Hungary was down to just four days of gasoline reserves, and prices had to be increased to reduce consumption.
But the taxi drivers contended that the 65 percent increase was more than they could afford and more than was justified by the higher price the government pays for crude oil. Some economists said much of the price increase was designed to balance the nation's budget and reduce consumption to help keep the nation's oil bill from ballooning and its trade balance from worsening.
 
Protests Reflect Impatience
 Many Hungarians said the protests reflected a growing impatience with the Government of Prime Minister Jozsef Antall for failing to make tangible improvements in economic conditions. There was also frustration that the price increase could add one or two percentage points to inflation, which has hovered near 30 percent for the past year.
The main opposition party, the Free Democrats, lashed out at the price rise. "We condemn the way the price increase has been implemented as well as its size," said Miklos Haraszti, a leader of the Free Democrats. "We fully understand the reaction. This price increase does not fit into any kind of economic strategy and will increase inflation."
In parliamentary debates, Gabor Fodor, a member of the Young Democrats, said the government would have a hard time wriggling out of the trap it had stepped into.
Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania have also raised gasoline prices, partly as a result of the cutbacks in Soviet oil shipments. But none of those countries had huge protests like those in Hungary.

HEADLINE: Women's Group Seeks Environmental Role

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Alarmed by the deteriorating health of the planet, women from around the world have come together to demand a bigger role in all levels of decision-making on the environment and development.
In a four-day session that ended Monday, 50 women met at the United Nations Church Center to establish a worldwide network for bringing their agenda into the environmental debate. Their immediate goal is equal representation at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in 1992. 
 The international committee includes leading environmentalists like Vandana Shiva of India; Wangari Maathai of Kenya, a grass-roots organizer; Dr. Rosalie Bertell of Canada, an environmental health specialist, and radical environmentalists like Claire Greensfelder of the Earth Island Institute in California.
Women have been "invisible in policy-making on environmental and development issues," said Bella Abzug, a founder of the Women's Foreign Policy Council, the meeting's sponsor. The participants put together a plan to mobilize their local constituencies and lay the groundwork for their own congress in Miami in November 1991, the Brazil conference in 1992 and other efforts over the next decade.
 
'A Real Learning Process'
 Although they came from diverse cultures in Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe and North America, the women had little difficulty in reaching a general consensus on their basic goals, principles and plan of action. They differed mainly in style, with some of the more radical campaigners fiercely attacking governments viewed as anti-environmentalist.
Libby Bassett, an American environmental consultant, said the congress did not become a regional debate or a struggle between the first world and the third. She described it as "a real learning process in which we worked out an alternative way of planning the planet."
The plan of action sets these main goals:
*Full participation by women in environment policy at all levels.
*Freedom of choice in family planning.
*Redefinition of development on the principle that investment must not destroy the environment.
*Increased education and information on the environment and development.
*Protection of natural systems.
*Development of a code of earth ethics.
The conference took health as its central theme, inspired by the work of Dr. Bertell, who heads the International Institute of Concern for Public Health, based in Toronto. For the last 12 years, Dr. Bertell has helped organize communities and individuals whose health is threatened by industrial and military pollution.
"Everybody agrees that the environment is sick -- the Earth and air, water, forests -- and that what we want is a healthy, balanced environment," said Chodchoy Sophonpanich, president of the Thai Environmental and Community Development Association.
 
Keeping 'Systems in Balance'
 Maria Eugenia de Cotter, director of the Arias Foundation of Costa Rica, said that healthy development means "keeping the natural systems in balance, whether it be the human system or the ecological system."
Tamar Eshel, a former member of the Israeli Parliament, said that up to now, women have been out of the environment policy process. She felt that this would change now, adding that her own government had asked her to report on the results of the meeting.
Brief reports from the industrialized and developing world on the health of the environment were equally grim.
"What we have today is maldevelopment, wealth and poverty," said Dr. Rosina Wiltshire of the Caribbean Conservation Association in Barbados. "This distorted concept of development will ultimately lead to the de struction of the planet."
In Thailand, people either don't know or don't care about environment, Ms. Sophonpanich said. She stressed that many laws have not stopped deforestation, either at the hands of businessmen or villagers.
 
'The War of Resources'
 In India, economic development has not improved the quality of life, said Vanaja Ramprasad, a consultant on ecology. "New technologies have increased food production but the majority cannot afford to buy."
"In Africa we have no choice; we know we're doing the wrong thing but what else can we do?" said Gertrude Mongella, a member of the Central Committee of Tanzania's governing party. She said impoverished women were among those who routinely exploit the environment, cutting down trees for firewood, growing tobacco, allowing overgrazing and using pesticides.
"Even if there's a woman at the top, they can still destroy environment very thoroughly," said Bernadette Vallely of the Women's Environment Network in Britain. She pointed to a crisis in the country's health service, as well as acid rain, poverty and high levels of pollution.
Concern over "the war of resources" was voiced by Perdita Huston, an American writer on women in development. Noting that most natural resources are found in the third world, particularly in the south, she warned that "the world is heading for a real south-north confrontation."
But Ms. Maathai, founder of Kenya's Green Belt tree-planting movement, cautioned, "It's easy to accuse the north, but they have brothers in the south who make it possible to exploit our resources." She said that members of local power elites must be made aware of "threats to all forms of life, even the butterflies."

HEADLINE: Peru's Leader Proposes A Market to Fight Coca

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Peru's new President has proposed a novel approach to fighting coca-leaf production: the creation of a free-market environment where peasants would find alternative crops to be economically attractive.
In a speech in Lima on Friday, the leader, President Alberto Fujimori, rejected military and police repression, which until recently was the dominant anti-coca strategy in Peru, the world's largest source of the raw material for cocaine. 
 Instead, Mr. Fujimori, an agronomist by training, proposed granting land titles to coca growers and radically slashing state controls and private monopolies that currently make cultivation of legal export crops unprofitable for small farmers.
"There is now no possibility of moving to other crops because of the restrictive regulatory environment," Hernando de Soto, a free-market theorist and contributor to the plan, said today in a telephone interview. Mr. de Soto, a key adviser to the new Government, is to travel to the United States on Monday to promote Peru's new approach.
 
Fear of Civil War
 Last month, Mr. Fujimori angered United States officials by rejecting a $35.9 million military aid package. The aid included training and equipping six Peruvian Army batallions for operations in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, an area responsible for most of Peru's annual $1 billion coca-leaf harvest.
During the presidency of Alan Garcia, who stepped down July 28, the United States financed an aggressive program in the Upper Huallaga of blowing up jungle laboratories and of eradicating fields of coca.
But fear of setting off a full-fledged civil war with the one million Peruvians involved in coca-leaf cultivation was a recurring theme in Mr. Fujimori's speech on Friday.
"Efficient repression, which leaves peasants without alternatives, could easily unchain a civil war of unsuspected dimensions," the President warned of the Upper Huallaga. The region is already heavily influenced by guerrillas of the radical Shining Path movement.
 
Plan to Revive U.S. Talks
 "Let us not repeat the errors of President Ngo Dinh Diem of Vietnam," the President continued in the speech, which was delivered to foreign diplomats, including Ambassador Anthony Quainton of the United States. "Here in Peru, we are not going to run the risk of being defeated because we put the peasants, their innumerable relatives, friends and countrymen on the side of the drug traffickers and terrorists."
Also on Friday, Mr. Fujimori sent President Bush a letter proposing renewed talks on military and economic aid. The military aid money rejected by Mr. Fujimori last month will now be reassigned to Bolivia and Colombia, two countries regarded by Washington as more cooperative in the war on cocaine.
In a sharp break with conventional discourse in the Andes over coca production, the Fujimori policy speech did not discuss specifics of military aid, economic aid or even potential alternative crops.
After the speech, Mr. Quainton told reporters that United States official would closely study the new anti-drug strategy before commenting.
 
Issuing of Land Titles
 In August, American officials were angered when Mr. Fujimori moved into retirement Juan Zarate, the police general most closely identified with American anti-drug efforts.
In early August, at the time of a visit to Lima by Vice President Dan Quayle, the United States Office of National Drug Control Policy called Peru's drug fighting effort "the most problematic" of the three Andean producers.
A report by the agency said the Bush Administration was evaluating the efforts of Peru's new Government to see if they "justify the provision" of more aid next year. The Administration has proposed sending $700 million in military and economic aid to Peru over the next five years.
Mr. de Soto estimated this week that land titles could be issued within a year to coca growers in the Upper Huallaga, the source of about one half of the world's clandestine coca harvest. But violence from guerrillas will undoubtedly be a major obstacle.
 
Army Commander Wounded
 In the last month, heavy fighting in the area has claimed the lives of over 160 people -- Army soldiers, peasants, and Shining Path guerrillas. On Oct. 19, guerrillas ambushed and severely wounded the regional army commander, Gen. Mario Britto Romero. The general's jeep driver and two bystanders were killed.
Even with peace, a free-market environment and access to rural credit, peasants may not be interested in dropping cultivation of coca leaves, which are the most profitable crop in Peru.

The Budget Battle Reflects The Strain in the System

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE 101st Congress began its two-year tenure in January of 1989 with a simple but lofty goal: to govern.
But as the weary and frustrated lawmakers struggled toward a close this weekend, days before the midterm elections, governing seemed almost beside the point. For some, the question was whether a bitterly divided legislative branch and a frantic White House could even function. 
"What we are seeing is a very good illustration that divided government doesn't work anymore," said Senator Warren Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican. "Our system of checks and balances that worked in a simpler time is now an obstruction to governing. The American people don't know who to blame because nobody is accountable."
The criticism was heartfelt, but perhaps unduly harsh. The 101st Congress will leave behind some bipartisan accomplishments: an overhaul of the 1970 Clean Air Act, a redesign of farm programs, new anti-discrimination protections for the disabled, a new child care program and, most important, a five-year regimen of spending cuts and tax increases aimed at cutting the Federal deficit by nearly $500 billion.
But it is a record tarnished by legislative disorder more severe than any in recent memory and all but obscured by five chaotic months of indecision and partisan warfare over the budget.
That assessment is especially galling to the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington.
"We ought to have some credit for the fact that this is not an agreeable or easy job to do," he said, his voice rising in anger. "It's courageous. It's heroic in some ways that the members of Congress can, in a representative government system, stand up immediately before an election and do unpopular things. People ought to take some hope from that process instead of dumping all over it, instead of saying that it isn't quite as tidy as some think it ought to be."
In many ways the battle of the budget was emblematic of everything else Congress did or was unable to do over the last two years. The lesson of divided government and splintered political parties is that it is impossible to simultaneously maintain partisan identities, make coherent policy and cut a deficit in the hundreds of billions. At each step in the legislative process, one or more of these objectives had to give way.
 
Better Than Expected
 "You have to judge the disorder and the chaos of the process by the magnitude of the economic and the political problem they were trying to cope with," said Tom Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. "On balance, the 101st Congress may have acheived more than anyone had a right to expect."
Given the mismatch between Government resources and the pent-up demand for Government services, the most striking characteristic of this Congress's legislation is that it directs others to do what the Federal Government is unwilling or unable to pay for. The Clean Air Act, the Americans with Disablities Act and the increase in the minimum wage are ways of requiring the private sector to achieve social objectives. Congress can claim credit for expanding the Medicaid program, but state governments will have to bear a heavy share of the cost.
Early on, this Congress was persuaded that the voters were not in a mood to pay for their programs. Landmark legislation providing catastrophic health insurance was adopted by the 100th Congress in 1988, but a year later the 101st repealed the law when angry senior citizens refused to pick up the tab. Budget negotiators' efforts to even consider linking Social Security or Medicare to recipients' incomes were squelched before they left the bargaining table.
Intent on addressing domestic needs long neglected, Democrats and Republicans alike struggled to produce the first overhaul of housing programs in more than a decade. But the measure was primarily symbolic, since the appropriation is expected to be small.
 
An Old-Fashioned Bill
 Of all the new initiatives, the child care program bears the closest resemblance to legislation molded the old-fashioned way. Financed partially by grants to the states and expansion of an existing tax credit, it was the centerpiece of both Democratic and Republican agendas this year despite a price tag of more than $20 billion over the next five years. The great majority of the benefits would go to low-income families through the tax credit.
But as the Senate Majority Leader, George Mitchell of Maine, noted, it can take decades to build the political support for such a huge undertaking. "The first child care bill was brought up 22 years ago," he said.
If the child care initiative was a success of divided government, there were also casualties. Despite their majorities, the Democrats failed to override a single one of Mr. Bush's 15 vetoes, including those on civil rights legislation and requirements for employers to provide unpaid leave for working parents.
Lawmakers had hoped for major surgery on the military budget. But events abroad dictated otherwise. Although military spending is supposed to decline by $170 billion billion over the next five years, the much anticipated "peace dividend" may be long in coming if American troops remain in the Persian Gulf.
Institutional reforms will also have to wait. Despite months of talks on overhauling the campaign finance system, Democrats and Repubicans remain stalemated over the central issue of spending limits for candidates. In the House, where an ethics scandal toppled Speaker Jim Wright of Texas in June 1989, Mr. Foley moved quickly to contain the damage. By the end of that year, House members had approved a previously defeated Congressional pay raise and a ban on outside speaking fees. The Senate would not ban the outside fees and settled for a small pay increase pegged to inflation.
For all their travails in negotiating a budget deal with the White House and their worries about Congress's image, both Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Foley are reveling in the recent polls that show Democrats on the winning side of the tax issue for the first time in a decade. Nine months ago, the Democratic leaders vowed firmly and frequently that they would not allow their party to be trapped into calling for tax increases.
But the President's acquiescence to new taxes last summer and the resulting fracture in the Republican Party has allowed them to shift the terms of the debate from whether to tax to whom to tax. Mr. Mitchell said he was not worried about a backlash even though Democrats had to provide the majority of votes forthe deficit reduction package.
"The President said there had to be new taxes, and he didn't just say it, he wrote it down," the Senator said with a grin.
But as the House Republican leader, Bob Michel of Illinois, said on the House floor in Saturday's predawn debate, the larger issue of governing was at stake. "We're attempting to turn our backs on instant political gratification, the curse of this institution," he said, pleading for Republican votes. "If you want to play you've got to pay."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
In Some Places Gentrification Is A Weekend Guest

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
JUST over a decade ago, Frenchtown was simply another boarded-up town on the Delaware River, a greasy spoon and a pizza parlor its only businesses. Today, it bustles on weekends with tourists who come from the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas for a day or two to enjoy its small-town charms and patronize its antique shops, boutiques and cafes.
Frenchtown represents a growing national trend in which once-depressed towns have transformed themselves, sometimes with professional advice, into magnets for lovers of expensive, creative merchandise and historic architecture. The disposable income of the 1980's, the numbing sameness of shopping malls and a reaction against bruising big cities have all helped feed the gentrification, redefining municipal identities almost overnight and sometimes stoking class frictions. 
 Changes have also come to Hudson River towns like Cold Spring, N.Y., in Putnam County and Piermont in Rockland County. In New Jersey, there are Frenchtown and Lambertville, both on the Delaware in Hunterdon County. Nor is the phenomenon limited to isolated towns: in Connecticut's sixth-largest city, the waterfront area known as South Norwalk -- and in recent years by the more trendy SoNo -- has become a popular weekend destination.
Most of these towns shared certain characteristics that made them ripe for revitalization. They had historic buildings dating from before the Revolutionary era through the Victorian. They were built on the waterfront and within an hour's drive of New York. Hurting economically, they were all open to new ideas.
Take Piermont, a town with a population of 2,500. Its main street, Piermont Avenue, consists of two- and three-story brick buildings, with elaborate lintels and cornices, and clapboard houses with wide porches. They provide the setting for the dozen antiques and crafts stores. But it wasn't always this way.
"It was a wild town where people would go to the bars on Saturday night and fight," said Anna Duzzi Stafford, the owner of Mistral, a shop selling European country furniture.
"In the past five years, there's been a renaissance as buildings changed ownership," said Vivian Harnett, a retailing pioneer who opened Goose Cove Antiques in 1981, shortly before the town's paper factory closed. "It's a step back in time."
Some native Piermonters, whose fortunes were most recently linked to those of the local paper mill, which closed in 1983, had a hard time adjusting to the upscale evolution. Piermont's gentrification hadn't brought displacement per se; many of the hardware shops and supermarkets had already closed from chain-store competition in a nearby town.
"There was a strain between your mill-town blue-collar workers and your so-called professional people," said Don Cocker, Piermont's deputy mayor, fire chief and highway commissioner, "but that's mended itself over time."
 
A Reaction to Malls
 Piermont's property taxes remain unchanged primarily because property values haven't been reassessed since 1967. But old-timers mind the crush of people on weekends, swarming around stores many residents can ill afford. "We're glad to see the buildings restored, but no one's ecstatic about how crowded the streets are," said one Piermont native. "And I can only window-shop."
The erosion of manufacturing has not been the only catalyst in the makeover of some towns. Historic preservationists and urban planners say the advent of the shopping mall also helped pave the way for small-town revivals nationwide by not only supplanting the middle-range retail market in many towns, but also by dulling shoppers' senses.
"For the past 20 years, towns have been trying to figure out where to go from here," said Kennedy Smith, the acting director for the National Main Street Center, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a non-profit organization in Washington. "And a piece of that has been discovering that people like to visit quaint small towns.
"Tourism is something that a lot of communities have latched onto -- capitalizing on their historic buildings and ambience -- to provide some general economic support," she added. "People are becoming a little tired of the artificial mall environment where you can almost pick out the Orange Julius blindfolded. They are looking for something that is real and authentic."
The 10-year-old center has worked with more than 650 towns and cities in 31 states in an effort to breathe new life into their communities while saving historic structures. Many have followed the path to tourism. Other towns that have attracted weekend explorers, Ms. Smith said, include Benicia, Alameda and Petaluma outside San Francisco; Tarpon Springs near Tampa, Fla., and Media and West Chester in Pennsylvania. Paradoxically, one of the great preservers of historic buildings is economic decline itself, since there is little pressure to raze them to make way for new structures.
The robust economy of the 1980's also contributed to the rebirth of certain towns. "People don't appreciate how rich this country got in the last 10 years, particularly in the three states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut," said Lawrence O. Houstoun Jr., president of the Atlantic Group in Cranbury, N.J., which advises cities and towns. "There was an incredible amount of disposable income, and people indulged themselves."
 
'Stress Victims'
 In keeping with the trend in travel toward people choosing to take a series of mini-vacations, some of them are heading to these towns for a night or two, using them as a base to view the fall foliage or visit historic sites. According to the United States Travel Data Center, the averge length of vacations has dropped from 5.7 nights in 1985 to 4.7 nights in 1989.
"We get a lot of stress victims from New York," said Gloria Cappiello, the owner of the Frenchtown's Old Hunterdon House, which offers four-poster beds and candle-lit breakfast for up to $115 a night.
Like Piermont, Frenchtown's transformation happened suddenly. Both the Old Hunterdon House and the Frenchtown Inn, considered one of the best restaurants in the state, opened in the last five years, as did most of the antique and gift shops.
"When we moved here in 1976, the town was basically boarded up," said Palmer Ward, the owner of Blackburn & Ward, a fine arts and antiques shop that opened in 1979. "The town was cheap, and arty people could afford to live here."
Some worry, however, that if the popularity streak continues for towns like Piermont and Cold Spring, they could become so big and slick they lose their small, old-fashioned feel. "Right now it's riding that fine line," said Leslie Farrell, a 28-year-old writer who grew up near Cold Spring. "But if Main Street gets any more developed, forget it."

U.N. Sponsorship of a War in the Gulf Is No Simple Matter

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
IN the nearly three months since Iraq invaded Kuwait, President Bush has assembled a most impressive international coalition in favor of punishing Baghdad. But now the United States and the other four permanent Security Council members are beginning to wonder if the United Nations could ever agree on terms that would give sponsorship to the use of military force.
The United States, Britain and France, which have the largest military deployments in the gulf, used to claim that they already had all the authority they needed to fight President Saddam Hussein -- Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which says one member can ask others for help against aggression. 
 But recent developments are pushing Washington to seek the Security Council's explicit blessing if it decides on military action.
Most other United Nations members, including the Soviet Union, have made clear that only if the Security Council authorizes force could they support it, send troops themselves or help defray the cost.
Some experts also dispute the claim that the use of force is condoned under Article 51, which Kuwait and Saudi Arabia invoked when they asked Washington and other capitals to send military units to the gulf.
Thomas M. Franck of New York University Law School and Abram Chayes of Harvard Law School said in Washington recently that the United States has lost that right because Article 51 only establishes the right of "collective self defense" until the Security Council takes measures "to maintain international peace and security." In their view, the sanctions and the authority to enforce them are such measures.
Pressure is also building among some members of Congress for the Administration to obtain Security Council approval for a war. Some Congress members, anxious to clip the President's foreign policy wings, believe the United States cannot fight without a formal Congressional declaration of war. As it prepared to recess, Congress appointed 18 members to watch developments and summon it back if fighting looks imminent.
But some experts say that even without Congress, an American President can fight once the Security Council orders a decision enforced by military might under Article 42. That provision allows the council to order "action by air, sea or land forces" to enforce an embargo.
Indeed, the legal route the Security Council has embarked on in the gulf crisis leads directly to the authorization of the use of force. The trade sanctions against Iraq were imposed under Article 41, which says the council can enforce its orders by economic pressure. If these prove inadequate, there is Article 42.
 
Complications Arise
 But there are difficulties. China or the Soviet Union could veto an American attempt to invoke Article 42. And the Pentagon worries that if the matter of going to war is discussed in the Security Council, the element of surprise will be lost.
In addition, another charter article threatens foreign interference in the command structure. Article 46 says "plans for the application of armed force shall be made by the Security Council with the assistance of the Military Staff Committee." That is a panel, long moribund, comprising the chiefs of staff or their designees of all five permanent members, which Moscow wants to revive, and which will meet this week. But to American military planners, who insist that their forces are independent and must remain so, it conjures up the specter of an international committee of generals running a war out of New York.
The United States side-stepped this difficulty in Korea by using the Soviet Union's absence from the council to have itself appointed commander of the international war effort. But that would be harder in this post-cold-war world. In addition, the United States and its allies insist on keeping control of their own forces in the gulf.
So if force is to be used in the Persian Gulf, the challenge is for the Security Council to find a way to authorize it under Article 42 in terms that are acceptable to Congress, maintain the international coalition against Saddam Hussein, preserve an element of surprise and satisfy Moscow's desire to activate the Military Staff Committee -- but leave the United States, Britain and France in command of their own forces.
Since the charter never says who shall command a United Nations force, this is technically possible. But whether the political will exists is another matter.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Governors Talk About Taxing and Spending

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
GOVERNORS in states from Alaska to Louisiana say that while they are fundamentally opposed to many of the ways Congress is raising and spending money in its new budget, their overriding concern is whether the effort in Washington can stabilize the slumping national economy.
Their views, given in interviews last week with 17 Governors, indicate how much state economies have become tied into national and international patterns. Their views also reflect the fact that 33 states are facing budget deficits this year. 
 Most of the Governors, Republicans and Democrats alike, said Washington had not gone nearly far enough in reining in the Federal debt, which now stands at more than $3 trillion and is projected to grow to $4.7 trillion by 1995 despite the new deficit-reduction measures. Although economists differ widely on the effects of the growing debt, the Governors said it is soaking up savings, causing interest rates to rise, depressing local economies and raising fears of a deep recession.
"It is not enough to simply reduce the rate at which the Federal debt is growing," said Gov. Steven Cowper of Alaska, a Democrat who is not running for re-election. "We need to balance the Federal budget this year and every year from now on. You won't find me whining and complaining about Federal cuts in programs and funds."
A handful of Governors gave Washington credit for starting to cope with the deficit. "The good news is that this is the first indication that they are facing reality," said Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont, a Democrat whose term ends in January.
"It's a step, but not a giant step, in the right direction," said Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican who is running for re-election. "But Congress has been on a spending binge for 30-some years."
At the same time, all of the Governors interviewed, as well as the budget directors of seven other states, expressed concern about the way the Federal Government has shifted more and more expensive responsibilities, particularly in health care, to the states.
 
More for Medicaid
 "Over the last three years," said Daniel M. Sprague, executive director of the Council of State Governments, "Congress has passed $2.5 billion worth of Medicaid mandates on to the states, and this latest budget is going to add another $2.5 billion in the foreseeable future." The added costs largely come from the mandated extension of Medicaid benefits and increased costs for states that pay Medicare premiums for some people to keep them out of the Medicaid program.
"When they talk about belt-tightening in Washington, they are talking about tightening our belts," said Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, who is in political trouble for raising taxes. He said that the state's $12 billion budget this year includes $1.2 billion for Medicaid and that he expects Medicaid costs to rise sharply next year.
Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio, a Democrat who is not running for re-election, gave as an example a requirement in the new budget that would cost Ohio $30 million a year by forcing the state to stop contracting out to the lowest bidder all of its prescription drug purchases, and start purchasing from manufacturers that give discounts on individual drugs. "At the Federal level this policy may look like a cost saving, but it's obviously not for us," Governor Celeste said.
The new budget also advances what the states view as Federal encroachment on their sources of revenue: excise taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and alcohol. In addition, the new Federal taxes are expected to reduce consumption and cause the state tax revenues to decline.
"It appears as though Washington expects the people to drive, to smoke and to drink their way out of this deficit situation," said Gov. George Deukmejian of Calfornia, a Republican who is not running for re-election.
In Indiana, Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat whose term ends in 1993, said: "They are just shifting the budget crisis from Washington out to the states. Congress can't rein in their political appetite for spending and, since they don't have any money, they have to look for the states to pay their bills."
The new budget also raises the hackles of state and local officials by subjecting more people to double taxation. In 1986, the Government started down this path by eliminating the deduction of state and local sales taxes on Federal forms; the new budget now eliminates a small portion of all deductible expenses for high-income taxpayers. Before long, state officials gloomily predict, Congress will disallow all deductions for state and local taxes -- a prospect especially painful in such high-tax states as New York, New Jersey and California.
"For Congress and a President that can't agree on raising taxes, the beauty of raising money by limiting deductions is that it is very difficult for us to explain to taxpayers what is happening," said Susan J. White, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Counties. "It's also being portrayed as a New York problem. Everybody likes to be anti-New York, but it clearly affects everybody because all states have property taxes and over 40 states have income taxes."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
A Traditionally Insular Community Begins to Reach Out

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
YU KIM LY was buried last week in his faded blue jeans. At his wake, near his coffin, the photograph of the winsome-looking 16-year-old and the small crowd of black-clad teen-age mourners offered few hints of the violent death he met the previous week on a street in lower Manhattan.
The boy was shot three times in the head along with two other teen-age friends, all members of the Vietnamese gang Born to Kill, a violent group that has increasingly encroached on the territory of established Chinese gangs, terrifying the Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean communities throughout New York. 
 Although law-enforcement officials said the three deaths were not officially gang related, the murders galvanized more than 20 Asian community groups, traditionally wary of outsiders, to meet recently with the police and protest increased gang violence and insufficient police protection.
Their protest differed from similar protests in past decades. Not only did it demonstrate a new pan-Asian solidarity, but it also appears to have been ignited by the changing random pattern of gang violence and the rise of the drug trade. The meeting also pointed up the chasm between Asian-Americans and the police department -- as well as conflicts within their own communities.
"Now is the time to fight back," Paul Mack, the executive director of the Brooklyn Chinese-American Community Association, said. "But without any assistance from higher up, we just can't do it. But also look at it this way, without cooperation from the community, there isn't much police can do."
The dramatic rise in the number of Asian immigrants over the last 20 years has been reflected by an increase in gangs. "The stakes are higher now," said Ko-lin Chin, a senior research analyst at the New York City Criminal Justice Agency, a private nonprofit organization, who wrote "Chinese Subculture and Criminality" (Greenwood Press, 1990). "More immigrants mean more business, more money, more power. There's more heroin trafficking. And when the gangs in the 90's now send a message, they kill people."
An estimated 300,000 Chinese live in New York, 150,000 in Chinatown. In the 1980's, as new groups from Taiwan and Hong Kong flowed in they settled in Flushing in Queens and along Eighth Avenue in Brooklyn, each area with Chinese populations of over 60,000. More recently, Chinatown has felt the influx of a wave of 30,000 undocumented immigrants, mostly from China's Fukien Province, according to Virgo Lee, the director of Mayor David N. Dinkins's office of Asian Affairs. The Vietnamese population has jumped from 5,000 to 40,000 since 1980.
A possible indication of increased gang activity is reflected in police statistics for Chinatown. The data for the first six months of 1990 show robberies up by 30 percent over 1989. In the Fifth Precinct, which patrols Chinatown, 13 people have been murdered so far, compared with 12 homicides for all of 1989. This month alone, five gang members were murdered in three separate incidents in lower Manhattan.
At the heart of the violence is Born to Kill and its rivalry with more traditional Chinese gangs. The gang, made up of young Vietnamese immigrants, is extremely unpredictable and violent and primarily involved in robbery, extortion and burglary of Chinese retail stores and restaurants.
"One merchant in Brooklyn was hit six different times in one day by gang kids who wanted money," Mr. Mack said, referring to different gangs.
The Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese gangs are linked to their community's social and economic life. The Chinese gangs especially rely on their relationship to certain large, established social and political associations. These groups use the youths to protect illegal activities like gambling, Mr. Chin said.
The leaders of the groups that have an association with the gangs "have an ambivalent and very subtle relationship with their gangs," said Mr. Chin. "They cannot dismiss them because they are the nuclear power of the adult organization. If they let them go, another will recruit them, and they will be left without street soldiers."
 
A Little Progress
 The communication gap between the police and the community only assists the gangs. The police claim that Asians are easier victims because they are scared or unwilling to report crimes; the community groups say the only solution in the short term is more police on the streets and in the long term school programs to discourage children from gangs.
The language barrier and the innate distrust of authority add to the unwillingness of the Asian community to work with the police or even appear in court. The police say they cannot make arrests and prosecute unless the attitudes change.
"The community has to make a difference," said Sergeant Michael Collins of the Fifth Precinct's Asian Gang Intelligence Unit. "They have to report the crimes. They have to stop participating in extortion. They have to be willing to follow through the system."
Community leaders, like Paul Yee, president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, a group of more than 60 community organizations, argue that the legal system quickly frees criminals, who take revenge on their victims, who lack police protection.
"We feel the system is just too ridiculous," Mr. Yee said. "The police blame the community people. They don't blame the crime."
Both law-enforcement officials and community leaders claim some progress. The police say they are increasing the number of uniformed patrol officers in the precinct and upgrading the gang surveillance unit.
Still, many present at the meeting were skeptical. To some, it recalled the old Chinese saying, "When alive don't go to authority. When dead don't go to hell."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
For Vietnam, The Price Of Progress Is Cambodia

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
THERE are two Southeast Asias, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan of Thailand is fond of saying: one thriving and capitalist, the other socialist and stagnant.
So it should be no surprise that even the famously stubborn Vietnamese leadership, despite its divisions over the pace of change, has realized that it must join the development race now or be forever left behind, floundering in a politically unstable swamp of unemployment and inflation. 
 That is the prime reason Vietnam finally decided to cut a deal on Cambodia and withdraw the bulk of its troops after an occupation of 11 years -- to end its international isolation and attract Western investment. And it is the prime reason that Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, went to Washington recently, the highest-ranking Hanoi official to do so since the north became independent in 1954.
That year, when the French left Vietnam, Hanoi was the most modern city in Southeast Asia. In 1975, when the Americans left, the region's most advanced city was Saigon. Both cities today have a sort of aspic charm, with moldy French provincial buildings in Hanoi and American DeSoto buses still grinding through the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.
The isolation and stagnation have been the price of both war and ideology. But now Hanoi, like the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, needs the West, and seems more willing to pay the price.
Vietnam eased central controls on the economy beginning as early as 1987. But a Cambodia-related embargo on aid, investment and trade with Vietnam, led by Washington, has successfully blocked vital loans from multilateral agencies like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
While more countries now trade with Vietnam, the American veto on the lending agencies has forestalled significant Western investment and stifled domestic development, particularly as Soviet aid declines.
A settlement in Cambodia, much more than the emotional and easily manipulated issue of the American M.I.A.'s, has always been the key to economic and diplomatic normalization between Washington and Hanoi. And only normalization will open Vietnam in a serious fashion to the West.
So it is Washington's main card with Vietnam, and even the American Chamber of Commerce, eager to do business with Vietnam, should not be surprised that the Bush Administration will continue to play it, at least until a Cambodia settlement is ratified.
Cambodia is also the main obstacle to normal relations between Hanoi and Beijing, whose support for Vietnam's revolution soured quickly over its Cambodian adventure. Hanoi's expulsion in 1979 of China's allies, the Khmer Rouge, no matter their crimes, was an insult for which the Chinese, especially Deng Xiaoping, were eager to extract the severest pain.
But China's own isolation over the killings near Tiananmen Square, coupled with the collapse of Eastern Europe and Moscow's sudden retrenchment everywhere, have also pushed Vietnam and China closer together.
Both leaderships are intensely aware of being socialist holdouts, but hope that Asian socialism will be a more lasting brand. They cite the communitarian nature of Asian societies and the fact that Communist rule rose from revolution and nation-building, and was not merely imposed, as in Eastern Europe, by a conquering army.
Still, there is an element of whistling in the dark. Vietnam's aging leaders, like China's, hope to embrace Western aid, investment and private enterprise while preserving the one-party nature of the Leninist state. But increasingly, younger intellectuals and those with more experience in southern Vietnam are expressing doubts that economic and political development can be separated -- or that the country can walk with one leg shorter than the other, as one Politburo member, Tran Xuan Bach, put it before being purged in March.
All this is taking place in the context of a leadership struggle. The party General Secretary, Nguyen Van Linh, has begun the reforms but lacks the time and strength to see them through. He has said he will retire at the next party congress, probably in May, and the battle between conservatives and reformers has gathered bite.
The conservatives, who had been grouped around Le Duc Tho, who died two weeks ago, and his brother, Interior Minister Mai Chi Tho, have used the collapse of Eastern Europe to try to brake any move toward even a Soviet-style multiparty system.
In the last five months, the Vietnamese have had a security crackdown, arresting as many as several hundred people, some for just a few days, especially in the south. They include retired soldiers of the old National Liberation Front, religious figures, businessmen and others with what the Government calls "too much" contact with Westerners.
While the internal crackdown has now eased somewhat, there continues to be a public campaign about the reported efforts of "reactionary forces overseas" to sabotage the state and socialism. Two weeks ago, a court in Hanoi convicted 38 people of trying to overthrow the Government with the help of Thailand and of Vietnamese exiles based in the United States.
While these people represent no real threat to the regime, the trial is apparently being used to justify the crackdown and serve as a warning to others, including the Western-leaning reformers in the leadership, among them the urbane Mr. Thach.
But while some might see his international prominence as a stepping stone of sorts, he will almost assuredly not be Vietnam's next General Secretary. Even in a collective leadership, there are other, less congenial forces at play.

HEADLINE: The Governor, the Folk Hero

 BODY:
"The Decade of the Child." "The Family of New York." Government with "a heart and a head." Mario Cuomo's language encapsulates the political man. He moves audiences with his oratory; he articulates the most humane goals. It's small wonder, as he runs against token opposition for a third term as Governor of New York, that Democrats consider him Presidential timber.
Closer to home, however, where the problems are great and the Cuomo magic familiar, New Yorkers see a sometimes maddening political figure who is, yes, better than most -- but who could also be so much more. If he would close the gap between oratory and accomplishment, he might become the folk hero his Democratic champions around the country think he is.
 The 58-year-old Mr. Cuomo is more comfortable with himself and his job than he used to be, less inclined to pick petty fights or to throw his intellectual weight around. With the economy weakening and tensions high, he is a soothing presence who never divides or appeals to base instincts.
He can be breathtakingly candid. At the recent dinner of an Italian-American organization, he could easily have given a dutiful speech but instead challenged his audience: "Wouldn't it be a sin if we, having heard those cruel epithets -- guinea, dago, wop -- were to sit back now and talk about 'the spics' and 'the niggers'?" That was Mr. Cuomo at his best, a moral leader.
Yet he is not, even after eight years on the job, a masterful political leader. He chooses competent but rarely outstanding staff. He portrays himself as a reformer but bows to the dictates of patronage. His policies brim with compassion but his programs often fall short.
Three years into his vaunted Decade of the Child, budget constraints have drained his ambitious plans to help needy children. It is no small achievement that next year, needy college students will be able to apply for Liberty Scholarships. But the Decade, so far, does not meet expectations.
The same is true of drug treatment: after announcing he wanted to create drug treatment "campuses" for 2,000 addicts, he backed off in the face of legislative and local opposition. The 2,000 new treatment beds will become 300 -- if Federal funding materializes.
The Governor's flaws will not prevent him or his sound running mate, Stan Lundine, from winning, nor should they. The Republican candidate, businessman Pierre Rinfret, has made a mockery of the campaign, failing to show any respect for the elective process. The Conservative, Herb London, appeals to a narrow electorate.
The public loses because there is no real campaign, no challenging scrutiny of the Cuomo record, so important now that the state is in bad economic trouble. The Governor has a point when he blames Washington and the Republican State Senate. But while he has produced some budget reforms, he has chronically underestimated the problem. He was a year late in seeking an essential delay of an income tax cut, and his failure to produce a convincing budget plan contributed to a reduction in the state's credit rating.
Neither has he helped New York City with its fiscal morass. He has the stature to mobilize business and labor leaders and politicians, but Mr. Cuomo has done little more than pronounce. To do otherwise risks making enemies, not his favorite strategy. Long Island would be saving 20,000 barrels of oil a day if Mr. Cuomo hadn't played to the unreasonable fears that closed Shoreham, the nuclear power plant.
On issues of profound principles, the Governor has admirably withstood withering opposition. He has repeatedly vetoed the Legislature's efforts to reinstate the death penalty and maintains a pro-choice stand on abortion.
On many other matters, though, Mr. Cuomo is loath to spend his political capital. He's likely to have many more opportunities. The economy will demand painful choices about how best to use shrinking resources. With crime worsening, he will have to go beyond his successful effort to double the state's prison capacity: the problem also demands effective drug treatment and more judges.
In a third term, he can work to meet the perceptions of those who know him only from his words. We endorse Governor Cuomo with the hope that, whatever the future brings him, he will resolve to match word with deed.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Republicans From Afar Glare at Washington

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REPUBLICANS always knew that history was working against them this year, that a President's party was almost bound to lose Congressional seats in a midterm election. But before Labor Day, with a popular President buoyed by Americans rallying around the troops in the Persian Gulf, many Republicans hoped to beat the odds.
Since then, in large part because of a worsening economy and the tumultuous budget negotiations, the political terrain has become far more perilous for Republicans. A week before Election Day, many are dismayed over the losses they expect, disgusted with the lack of political acumen displayed by the White House in the budget talks and deeply divided over their party's philosophical direction. 
 Democrats are downright gleeful. "We're more upbeat, no question about it," said Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee.
White House officials were scrambling to repair the political damage, sending President Bush out on the stump last week to claim that the Democrats made him do it -- made him raise the taxes that he promised not to touch. But there was considerable doubt within his own party as to whether that could overcome weeks of Democratic agitprop depicting the Republicans as the guardians of the rich and the plunderers of Medicare.
There was no clearer sign of Republican distress than the public feuding of recent days, extraordinary for a party that had prospered in togetherness for a decade while "Democrat" became synonomous with disarray. During the 1980's Republicans of all ideological hues shared a stage with Ronald Reagan.
But last week, Mr. Bush found himself on the campaign trail for Republicans who kept him at arm's length. It was a taste of what his Democratic counterparts have known for years: the loneliness at the top of a divided party. "Never get between a Congressman and re-election, even if you're the President of the United States," said one Republican strategist.
An embarrassing memo to Republican candidates from Edward Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, was published in The Washington Post. "Do not hesitate to oppose either the President or proposals being advanced in Congress" on taxes, it said. The White House was reduced to public complaining about a party official.
These little humiliations were just part of payback time for Mr. Bush. Throughout the budget negotiations, some Republicans felt that the White House was taking a very cavalier attitude toward the fate of the Congressional wing of the party in the 1990 elections.
 
A Strategy Gap
 Since Lee Atwater, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, fell ill with a brain tumor last March, Republicans have worried about the political instincts of this White House. Without Mr. Atwater, and with James Baker consumed by his duties at the State Department, Mr. Bush has lost the two men who guided him to the Presidency in 1988. John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, has tried to step into the void, but recent weeks have hardly been a testimony to his political skills.
Still, there are deeper passions at work. The glue that bound the Republican Party over the last 10 years was the charismatic leadership of Ronald Reagan, a fierce anti-Communism and an abhorrence of new taxes. This budget agreement is no mere issue dispute, but painful heresy to many conservatives.
"Republicans at every level are being asked to abandon what they thought was the heart and soul of the Republican message for at least the last 12 years," said Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota. "We've been asked to follow a path down which we cannot go."
The Republicans' angst has an added edge because their political fortunes seemed to shift so quickly. Many have watched in horror as the budget negotiations raised such unpopular ideas as higher gasoline taxes and Medicare cuts while the economy continued to sour. The public debate often became a kind of morality play, adroitly scripted by the Democrats: millionaires versus Medicare recipients, Republicans versus Democrats.
The polls began to show a worrisome erosion in support for the party and some of its candidates, as well as a sharp decline in Mr. Bush's popularity.
One of the more disturbing trends for Republicans in recent weeks has been a shift toward the Democrats among the elderly, who tend to vote in high numbers in midterm elections."Older voters pay more attention," said Mr. Tully of the Democratic National Committee, "especially when you get a budget package where their program is on the line."
Election Day predictions are now being adjusted. Democratic voters "are going home," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll-taker. But Mr. Hickman, like some of his Republican counterparts, says the movement is not on the scale of 1982, when Republicans lost 26 House seats at the height of a recession, or 1986, when the party lost control of the Senate. "In '82 and '86 it was a tidal wave," Mr. Hickman said. "This year, it's a big breaker."
This is a time when both parties try to lowball expectations, but Republican campaign officials say they will be happy to keep their losses in the House to single digits. Even small losses in the House would hurt. In 1982, the party began with a base of 192; this year, because George Bush carried no Republican House members into office with him in 1988, the party starts with just 175.
In the Senate, some analysts say the Republicans will be hard-pressed to meet their goal of picking up two or three seats and thus being well positioned to regain control in 1992. Equally worrisome for them is the tightening of several critical Governors' races where Republicans had strong leads, including Texas and Ohio.

HEADLINE: FILM VIEW;
Horror '90: They're Taking Your Home

BYLINE: By Caryn James

 BODY:
"LADY," SNARLS A HIGH-INTEREST moneylender as he refuses to help Melanie Griffith pay the mortgage. "You're sitting on a $750,000 piece of property. Sell it and keep the change."
Sounds like good advice, but being practical about home ownership is a villainous trait in "Pacific Heights," the sloppily plotted but commercially successful new film about the romance of real estate. Ms. Griffith and Matthew Modine play an unmarried couple who buy a Victorian house they can scarcely afford. Michael Keaton is the tenant from hell, who farms cockroaches on the premises in one of many improbable schemes to steal their property out from under them. 
 The moneylender, in his single scene, evokes decades of movie bankers who threaten to foreclose on the farm. And Ms. Griffith's whiny plea, "It's our home!" is the film's most heroic line, for she is the virtuous homesteader. But something more than a cinematic convention is at work in this mediocre thriller.
"Pacific Heights" may be the harbinger of the recession-era movie, preying on the legitimate and timely 90's fear of losing one's home. In a larger-than-life way, it touches the same nerve as some chilling economic news reports. In the last year, there has been a record number of foreclosures in the northeastern United States; the middle classes from New York to Tokyo are finding it next to impossible to buy homes; many economists talk about recession as inevitable, and some say it's already here.
So in several current films, the sacred house is invaded; and that action evokes the worst economic fears of the middle class. Superficial plots suggest the lost dream of home ownership and give films a topical edge.
In both "Pacific Heights" and "Ghost," an unmarried couple find romance in renovating their home (for white-collar workers, they're awfully handy with nail guns), only to have that home invaded by sociopaths and killers. The idyllic country house in "Arachnophobia" is overrun by lethal spiders. The unlucky house behind a "For Sale" sign in "Desperate Hours" is invaded by Mickey Rourke as an escaped killer. And unlike the spirited westerns of old, these contemporary stories of beleaguered homeowners are often as pessimistic as today's economic forcasts.
The movie home has always been a sanctuary and a symbol of the American dream, of course. "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940) is the quintessential Depression-era movie, with its homeless Joad family carrying the weight of a decade of economic desperation. "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946) shows that if George Bailey (James Stewart) had not been born, the townspeople would have been left at the mercy of the heartless banker played by Lionel Barrymore.
More recently, foreclosure movies have flourished in times of economic crisis. In 1984 alone, when American farmers were struggling fiercely for survival, three major films dealt with losing the farm. Sissy Spacek and Mel Gibson in "The River" and Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard in "Country" were contemporary farmers who fought the elements and the banks to keep their homes. Sally Field played a Depression-era single mother struggling to maintain her cotton crops in "Places in the Heart," but its story clearly echoed the contemporary farmer's situation.
"Country" was the strongest and most realistic in portraying the wearying psychological battle and isolation of the embattled farm couple. "The River" offered a more cliched view of neighbors pitching in to help save the farm. There, when a flood threatens the crops, the community turns up to salvage them. And Danny Glover as a drifter and John Malkovich -- a blind boarder, he is the tenant from heaven -- pick enough cotton to keep the family going in "Places in the Heart," whose title suggests the sentimental yet willful spirit that informs all three films.
Like "The Grapes of Wrath" and "It's a Wonderful Life," they were defiant movies about the triumph of the human spirit over the forces of big business and an uncaring government. The 1984 films were such strong activist statements that Ms. Spacek, Ms. Lange and Ms. Field testified before the House Agriculture Committee the next year to support increased Government aid to farmers. These movies tapped into a feisty sense of social activism, the spirit that led to the pop-rock benefit concert Farm Aid.
But it's hard to imagine Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine being asked to comment on the savings and loan bailout. The 90's real-estate films are not only escapist, they also reflect a cynical social mood. With characters pitted against economic and social forces far beyond their control, these films are informed by a sense of helplessness and doom. As the characters fight for their very lives, it seems both inevitable and secondary that they may lose the house along the way.
Like most tragedies, "Pacific Heights" and "Ghost" start by establishing the idyllic world soon to be lost. For both couples, love means renovating together. "Ghost" begins with Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore breaking through a wall in their new home, the first they have shared. Great care is given to the decoration of this artsy loftlike apartment, which holds a huge statue of an angel and a
potter's wheel. But while Mr. Swayze's character may be great at moving furniture, he never manages to get out the L-word and say, "I love you."
The couple in "Pacific Heights" lavishes more care and attention on their house than on their decision to have a child. When Ms. Griffith's character announces she's pregnant, presumably not by plan, Mr. Modine says, "Congratulations," and that's that. The next time the matter is discussed, over dinner at a restaurant and in the presence of a friend, Ms. Griffith says casually, "I don't have to be pregnant." Mr. Modine replies of course she does; he won't sacrifice their child for the mortgage, and that's that again.
Given the muddled script of "Pacific Heights," it's hard to say whether these scenes were meant to be the entire "Let's have the baby" conversation. But whatever the intention, as in "Ghost," the home seems a repository of emotions and perhaps a substitute for more difficult personal issues.
These too-perfect lives, of course, are soon shattered. In "Ghost," Mr. Swayze is murdered, only to reappear as a specter. One of the more effective scenes in this thriller-comedy-romance takes place when the murderer invades their apartment and the newly-dead Mr. Swayze isunable to warn Ms. Moore of her danger. He is helpless and invisible in his own home.
And the couple in "Pacific Heights" is at times equally helpless, at the mercy not only of the demonic invader but also of more ordinary evils; once more, the government works against the struggling homeowner. The couple is morally right but legally wrong in trying to force the tenant out, so the police and the courts offer them no protection. Finally, the all-American dream of home ownership becomes a lethal nightmare as the tenant battles the landlords to the death.
Throughout "Pacific Heights," you might expect a lack of sympathy for these overextended yuppies; they are, after all, sitting on a $750,000 piece of property. Instead there is a sense that they don't deserve their troubles, for Ms. Griffith's "It's our home" echoes a similar helpless cry by thousands of middle-class men and women sitting on less valuable property. Whether they are symbolic movie characters or real-life homeowners, they are pitted against a gigantic, failing economy, worrying about how to pay the mortgage.
Even a lighthearted film such as "Arachnophobia" evokes a similar sense of not being in control in one's own home. When Jeff Daniels moves his wife and two small children from the city to a small town, he gets a house and a barn full of poisonous spiders. He saves his family almost single-handedly, though he is enough of an urban sophisticate to think twice before smashing a spider with an expensive bottle of wine. But here Dad saves the homestead only to leave it, with great relief. At the film's end, the family heads back to San Francisco, where even the threat of earthquakes seems less ominous than the unknown dangers of the country.
"Desperate Hours," Michael Cimino's commercially disastrous remake of the 1955 Humphrey Bogart film, also plays to the fears of invasion, though without much effect. If Mickey Rourke takes over a house and holds a family hostage, it should make for an intense experience. Instead, this film is laughable and overwrought. But in conception, at least, it suggests that the 90's home is not the secure haven it was in the 50's. The happy husband and wife of the original have become a divorcing couple, and the old homestead is now on the market.
Mimi Rogers, who plays the mother held hostage, is quoted in the film's publicity material as saying, "What is truly frightening is the thought of someone invading your home, violating that space. Even in a dangerous world, it's the one place where you're supposed to be safe from whatever craziness or violence is happening outside." If "Desperate Hours" had been more successful in conveying that sense of violation, perhaps it would be doing far better commercially. And the film's happy ending -- the family reunited once more in their own home -- is one of its least convincing, least timely touches.
For the message of the more popular films is fearful and nervous, as in "Pacific Heights" and "Arachnophobia," or at best bittersweet, as in "Ghost." In all of them, some emotional understanding or moral truth is gained, some justice restored; Patrick Swayze heads toward a better afterlife and all those spiders go to the great beyond, too. But something is definitely lost. Usually it's real estate.

HEADLINE: A Directory of Cruises Worldwide;
Casting Off in the Spice Islands

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; STEVEN ERLANGER is head of the Bangkok bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
There is apparently something about a tropical cruise that encourages a California Republican to put orchids in the tops of his knee-length black socks, a Canadian accountant to don a tribal sarong cum dagger and a New York epidemiologist to sit down to dinner in drag.
Unavoidable collegiality on a small ship, aided by alcohol, will do that to the stiffest of people. But the extraordinary landscapes of Indonesia's most primitive islands, hugging the Equator in eerie, barren magnificence, must bring out and distort the tribal instincts, no matter how attenuated, in all of us. 
 This offering of P & O Spice Island Cruises, which moves among the 10 or so main islands of Indonesia's Lesser Sundas, stretching from lush Bali to parched Timor, is not merely for those tired of the usual journeys.
These are some of the most varied and unspoiled waters in the world, free of Thailand's sewage and Penang's murky waters, with psychedelic fish and startling reefs of coral as yet unsmashed by human hands. These cruises, which began five years ago, thus bring to a much wider group the possibility of travel to a part of the world long limited to backpackers with visions of Joseph Conrad, young graduates eager to find material bizarre enough to carry a first book, or what is usually and eumphemistically referred to as "the hardy traveler" -- the kind who enjoys a good steamer, the trampier the better, and a night out in the village goat shelter.
For a week in early October, with the hope of amusement in my heart and 27 other passengers, I sailed with the company's latest purchase, a 121-foot Australian-built passenger catamaran called the Spice Islander. It can hold 42 passengers (62 if people triple up) in 4 suites and 17 attractive, well-designed cabins. The ship, which on three levels includes a dining room, two lounges with bars and a sundeck with a weak Jacuzzi bath, rides on twin hulls; these hulls lend stability and let it roam in shallower waters.
The company's other catamaran, the Island Explorer, is similar: 134 feet long, with 12 cabins, 5 suites and a stunning dining room, with large windows, at the bow. The ships are represented in the United States by Abercrombie & Kent.
I chose to sail west from Kupang, on West Timor, back to Bali along a southern route, hitting Suwa, Sumba, Komodo, Satonda, Moyo and Lombok islands, although one can also chose the eastern and northerly route, from Bali to Sumbawa, Komodo, Flores, Lembata and West Timor, or spend 16 days and make the entire circle.
The cruises try, sometimes awkwardly, to mix culture, commerce, wildlife and a lot of water sports, with at least one shore excursion every day. While the anthropology is hardly serious, with mock ceremonies performed by islanders and good-natured but amateurish slide lectures on board in the evenings, this is still rather far from the beaten track of boutiques and Balinese "dinner and dance" performances. The cruise offers a relatively leisurely look at remote and intricate societies on Sawu, Sumba, Sumbawa and Flores that not too many others have seen, and at some weird wildlife too, like the Komodo dragon, one of the world's oldest surviving species and its largest, smartest and most bloodthirsty reptile.
Meanwhile, between astounding sunrises and sunsets, you can sleep comfortably as the ship sails each night, eat safely if unexcitingly, buy as much of the local ikat fabric as you can carry and absorb as much sun and saltwater as you're likely to be able to stand. And you are spared the usual social director and bingo games common on larger cruises.
You can swim or snorkel from pristine beaches on uninhabited islands, fish for red snapper and tuna, scuba dive, if trained, with a crewman divemaster, windsurf or water ski or simply cruise around looking at the fish and coral from a glass-bottomed boat. This is stored on board, along with two smaller Zodiacs, to take passengers to shore.
 The 21 crew members, all Indonesian,are generally so solicitous and sweet-tempered that they'll allow you to do almost anything within reason, and there are no extra charges except for drinks and laundry. The crew's only real fault, discounting some disorganization on this early shakedown cruise for this ship, is that its members may forget what they promised you if someone else asks them for something else a few minutes later.
 The extremely good-natured and varied group of fellow passengers included six nationalities; the bulk were American. There was also a pleasant range of ages, and only one passenger who seemed regularly unhappy, having expected a more leisurely and traditional sort of cruise.
The cruise operates in a fascinating part of Indonesia, which stretches over 3,000 miles from east to west and encompasses over 13,700 islands, of which some 6,000 are named and 1,000 inhabited all year. This is also a far cry from swarming Jakarta or the intensely settled and detailed societies of central Java, parts of Indonesia that should also be seen. These islands, which are known locally as Nusa Tenggara, stretch some 700 miles and are the peaks of two submerged mountain ranges. The southern one, running from Sumba to Timor, is nonvolcanic, while the northerly one, stretching from Bali to the Alor Islands and dominating Sumbawa and Flores, is intensely volcanic, with the steaming plumes of Mother Earth's digestive system often visible from the ship. With deep waters and fast currents between them, the islands are vastly different from one another. The landscapes are similar, but get drier and more parched moving eastward, with steep hills, narrow coastal plains, savanna and grassland, and scattered lontar palms that provide food, drink and shelter.
But the inhabitants live very distinct lives, often speaking different dialects and sometimes ignorant of the national language, Bahasa Indonesia. Depending on their varying histories -- some islands were discovered by Arab traders, others claimed by the Dutch or the Portuguese -- their religions vary, too, from Hinduism in Bali, Islam next door in Lombok and Sumbawa, Roman Catholicism in Flores and Timor and Protestantism in Sawu, Sumba and many of the rest.
Yet not very far beneath this layer of "foreign" beliefs is a healthy dose of animism, with firm faith in magic, spirits and animal sacrifices tied in to a sophisticated tribal society of ceremony, ritual and negotiations.
These mixed beliefs, with their varying symbols and totems -- from local animals and plants to the lion's heads and tulips taken from old Dutch coins and porcelains -- give interest and value to the highly distinctive warp ikats of these islands, Sawu, Roti and Sumba in particular. Ikat means to tie, and the threads of the warp are patterned by being repeatedly dyed, after different sections have been protected by being tied with dye-resistant fibers.
The results can be magnificent, and even if the villagers you see are primed for your arrival, with their wares on display for purchase after they do some traditional dances of welcome or ceremony, many of the ikats are worth their modest, post-bargaining price.
It is, perhaps, an unavoidable compromise, given your intrusion and their performance, and it helps them survive in a harsh but slowly modernizing landscape, where the cash economy becomes more important. P & O's cruise ships are the only ones to come to these villages, and then only once a week, so some sense of proportion is maintained.
Still, judging from fellow passengers, a lot of people like to buy as much as travel, a sentiment caught by the ship's chief steward, Yusdi Diaz, who announced after a village dance performance on Sawu, "Now it's buying frenzy time."

 The Wallace line cuts through these islands, which the great 19th-century naturalist Sir Alfred Russel Wallace saw as the break between the fauna of Asia and Australasia. West of Lombok, he suggested, are the tropical vegetations, monkeys, elephants, tigers and straight human hair of Asia, while east began the arid plants, cockatoos, lizards, parrots, marsupials and curly human hair of the Australasians and Melanesians. The islands of Nusa Tenggara are considered transitional, with examples of both types, and some unique species.
The fierce and peculiar Komodo Dragon is one. Often 10 feet long, with a forked tongue and hinged jaw like a snake, a thwacking, heavy tail, sharp, sawlike teeth capable of quickly hacking a goat or deer into three or four digestible chunks, it is worth the short trek to its austere habitat.
Huge monitor lizards believed to date from the Jurassic Age and to be extinct everywhere else, the dragons survived because of Komodo Island's inaccessibility. They have no competition as predators and live protected in a huge national park that covers Komodo Island and bits of Flores. Visitors are guided by rangers whose only protection is a cleft stick.
There are always stories of tourists who disappear except for their cameras and gnawed footwear; the week before we arrived, one ranger got bitten because he hung on to a goat a moment too long for the dragons' liking.
The rangers also like to tell disgusting dragon tales for the delectation of visitors, as lizards hiss below in a pit. One grinning ranger, after stirring up the dragons by imitating the bleats of a goat, said: "One time the mother, she eat her baby still in the shell, and she eat shell, too -- she eat everything."
You won't be tempted to do the same on the ship, which serves an awkward mixture of bad Western and indifferent Indonesian food. Some of the best meals were made from fish or lobsters caught by the passengers or crew, although given the expanse of the ocean around us, there wasn't enough fish on offer. The Australian beef is of excellent quality, though usually overcooked. But the desserts are fine and so is the wine list, which offers sensible French and Australian wines for nearly duty-free prices.
Breakfasts and lunches are buffet and offer reasonable choices. But the breakfast buffet is heavy on bacon, sausage and eggs, with heated frozen croissants and danishes and white bread near a toaster, while the cereals were all stale, a hazard of the sea. There was fruit and cheese, however, and very good Balinese coffee available almost around the clock.
But the notion of a relatively stiff, four-course dinner every night in this part of the world is silly, and most passengers said they would be happy with lighter, less pretentious fare, with fewer canned vegetables and canned sauces. There is a choice of two main courses, but except for the last, festive evening, which produced the Republican in orchids, the cooking is Western, and there are some nights on which no fish is offered. One can sit where one likes and needn't dress for dinner, so the atmosphere is pleasant enough. After days filled with so much exoticism, there probably is something reassuring about a simple hunk of beef and some frozen french fries.
 
GETTING SHIPSHAPE FOR A VOYAGE
 
 What You Get
The Spice Islander's cabins are attractive and comfortable, with simple wooden appointments.
There are built-in drawers, cupboards and a closet to cut down clutter. Well-designed bathrooms allow you to take a shower without getting everything drenched.
The ship makes its own fresh water for washing, and there is also laundry service.
So-called suites are only marginally larger and are not worth the extra money. But if you want a queen-sized bed instead of twin beds, insist on it when you reserve. The cabins also have a pulldown twin bed for families.
 
What to Take
The islands covered by the cruise are close to the Equator and the sun is very strong. It's important to take a good sunblock (hard to find in Indonesia), a hat, and T-shirts to swim, snorkel or dive in. You can buy aloe vera on the boat, which has a small stock of drugstore items (though best take your own). A male nurse doubles as a cabin steward.
Also take cotton clothes that are easily washable, at least two swimsuits and clothing suitable for visiting temples and for village ceremonies; for shore visits, culottes for women are fine, but not short shorts or tank tops.
Thin nylon diving boots provide good protection from sea urchins and sharp coral, and take at least one pair of comfortable walking shoes.
The ship provides fins, masks and snorkels, plus a few sets of diving gear. But if you like to dive, say so when you book, and take your own equipment (minus the tanks, of course).
 
Tipping
 There are no extra charges for diving or anything else save drinks and laundry, and those can be settled at the end by credit card.
The company suggests anonymous tipping at $4 per passenger per day. -- S. E.

HEADLINE: TV VIEW;
Soothing Bromides? Not on TV

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
TELEVISION ENTERTAINMENT has a knack for sticking close to current headlines, not only with those inevitable docudramas rolling hastily off the more sensational stories (Leona Helmsley's in "The Queen of Mean" or Charles Stuart's in "Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston") but also in the seemingly pedestrian plotting of weekly series.
If the news is dominated by reports of economic decline, rampant crime, drugs, homelessness and official corruption, many prime-time shows -- especially the law-and-order ones -- waste little time catching up, reflecting what has already happened and, in some instances, anticipating what could happen. This season, from NBC's "Law and Order" and Fox's "Against the Law" to CBS's "Trials of Rosie O'Neill" and ABC's "Cop Rock," passing images of the nation's social order can be remarkably scathing and unsettling. 
 Not too long ago, television was thought to be the Great Unifier. Back then, before the cable boom of the 1980's, the three commercial networks alone could command the loyalty of more than 90 percent of prime-time viewers. It was not unusual for most of the country to be found snuggling up together for an episode of "I Love Lucy." For the most part, depictions of society's basic institutions were comforting. Formats were simple, with the good guys clearly identified. The police and other law enforcers, certainly, could nearly always be counted on to be brave and incorruptible. The influence of "Dragnet" stretched over decades.
Today? A police officer can turn out to be a sadistic executioner ("Cop Rock") or a reactionary lug ("The Trials of Rosie O'Neill"). No institution, it would appear, is exempt from an unblinking and sometimes brutal diagnosis. Far from being a noble Marcus Welby, doctors can turn out to be alcoholic blunderers ("Law and Order") or scheming crooks ("Against the Law"). Even representatives of the clergy, long sacrosanct in the gallery of pop images, can become targets, with some priests being exposed as sex offenders (HBO's "Judgment"). The former Great Unifier is, evidently, no longer a reliable source of soothing bromides.
Several reasons can be cited. Like the industry itself, television programming has become more fragmented, appealing to narrower audience targets and, at the same time, more subject to the pressures of innumerable ethnic, racial and special-interest groups, all eager to get their viewpoints represented and promulgated. On a broader level, now that the profligate 1980's have given way unmistakably to the sobering 1990's, a certain sourness is becoming pervasive in the national psyche, as politicians have recently been discovering.
National deficits, budget battles, savings-and-loan scandals, ominous economic developments, the lot, are adding up to a nasty hangover that encourages a hostile "us vs. them" mentality. Even George Bush is not immune. Campaigning for Republicans these days, the President attempts to portray himself as a Washington outsider doing valiant battle against insider Democrats.
In TV entertainment, meanwhile, there is an escalating cynicism about figures of authority. Mayoral candidates, for instance, are openly corrupt on at least two series, "Cop Rock" and ABC's "Gabriel's Fire." In the Showtime movie "Rainbow Drive," an honest police officer does battle with villains ranging from his fellow policemen to manipulating politicians to the town's most powerful newspaper publisher, all of them involved in multimillion-dollar drug deals.
When finally exposed, the publisher is unfazed, arrogantly echoing Mrs. Helmsley ("Only the little people pay taxes") with a remark that "nobody who counts ever pays." For good measure, the wealthy titan adds: "Do you really think that billions of dollars in trade can pass through this country without involving people at the highest levels?"
Perhaps the most startling development in weekly-series scripts over the last year or so has been the emergence, on several levels, of a pronounced class consciousness. Americans generally are not supposed to be overly concerned with class distinctions. In fact, in his new book, "The Imperial Middle: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Class," the social and literary critic Benjamin DeMott argues that a persistent denial of fairly rigid class lines prevents many of us from considering issues honestly. Yet that denial is now being vigorously challenged in, of all places, prime time.
The trend began evolving last season with NBC's "Shannon's Deal" -- now scheduled as a midseason replacement -- and the decision of its John Sayles hero to leave the lucrative world of corporate law and become a private detective, struggling to put his values and shattered life back into reasonable order. This season we have, among others, the title character of "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," a socially connected lawyer who, dumped by her wealthy husband, becomes a public defender after realizing that at the age of 43 she has nothing to show for her life except credit cards and a Mercedes.
At the other end of the social scale there's Simon McHeath, the lawyer hero of "Against the Law." Raised in a Bronx tenement and now being divorced by his wealthy wife, Simon can't resist defending assorted social rejects. His father-in-law, head of a very Establishment law firm and unable to recruit the brilliant maverick, is snootily contemptuous: "You went to the wrong school, lived on the wrong side of town and divorced the wrong wife." Simon grins mischievously.
A growing awareness of class may well be an unavoidable byproduct of the Reagan era when, as the statistics keep telling us, the rich got richer and the poor poorer. The process and possible consequences have been described forthrightly by the conservative analyst Kevin Phillips in his book "The Politics of Rich and Poor." Here again, surely, is an underlying cause for the proliferation of us-vs.-them attitudes, whether they concern haves and have-nots or, as Mr. Bush would have it, official Washington and "real people," presumably meaning himself and his supporters.
On television series, the phenomenon can take odd turns. On a recent episode, Rosie O'Neill (Sharon Gless) was advised not to put her defendant, a mechanic from El Salvador, on the stand because "the jury will see just another wetback." Winning an acquittal for her client on the robbery charge, the triumphant Rosie is stunned when the mechanic shows up at her home and, in a vaguely threatening manner, begins talking resentfully about the rich women who bring him their BMW's and Jaguars for repair ("I'm nothing to them stuck-up bitches").
Then he begins directing his anger at Rosie -- "I'm not good enough to sit in your living room. You are not better than me. You are as bad as all the rest of them." Rosie is horrifed at the thought that maybe the man was indeed guilty, yet disturbed by the possibility that his accusations are on target. The man disappears, but Rosie ends up feeling like a hypocrite.
Another theme running through many of the newer series is the conviction that the system, not just criminal justice but all institutions, simply do not work. On "Law and Order," for instance, an investigation of a hospital and its staff finds that "when they don't catch their sometimes fatal mistakes, they just bury them." Medicine, someone observes, is "part science, part lottery." In "Against the Law," hospitals are described as "mills -- push 'em in, shove 'em out." The justice system, its prisons bursting at the seams, appears mired in ineffectual but expedient compromises. After a subway vigilante case in "Law and Order," a Jesuitical district attorney grimly observes: "This is not a question of win or lose. It's just a deal -- suspended sentence and probation. The right thing? Seems to be all we did was make two wrongs seem like a right."
Police have been a traditional source of rich programming material, and there seems to be no change imminent on that score. On current schedules, police can be found as first-rate crime-fighters (the detective team on "Law and Order"), as buffoons (the would-be-cowboy police chief on "Cop Rock" and weepy Andy on "Twin Peaks") and as dangerous killers (seething LaRusso in "Cop Rock" and the prison guards in "Gabriel's Fire"). And when it comes to class stratifications, police happen to be, rather uncomfortably, near the very middle.
Those police officers who work in urban ghettos are often mired in apathy, cynicism and low morale. Several weeks ago, a Brooklyn patrolman, 25 years old, offered this comment to a newspaper reporter: "In the five years I've been here, I've been spit at, kicked, sent to the hospital once and shot at on two different occasions. If you are going to be in a high-crime area, you're not going to have a great opinion of the people who live there." This kind of real-life situation was perhaps captured most vividly on television this season in several scenes on "Cop Rock" in which busted drug dealers sang out their fury in rap: "He calls you son, he ain't your dad, he's just a cop, and you make him mad." Back at the station house, bitter cops booking suspects had their own song: "Garbage In, Garbage Out."
At the same time, the police can find themselves suddenly thrust into the upper reaches of society. Again on "Cop Rock," officers investigating a burglary at a luxurious home are treated like low-paid help ("Have you ever been to Machu Picchu?" the elegant wife asks), which prompts a musical fantasy on their access to the "good life" ("Take a look, but don't touch").
Television entertainment still has its old-fashioned formats and formulas. CBS's "Top Cops," for instance, uses a new "reality" veneer to portray the police in familiar and almost exclusively heroic terms and, despite soaring crime statistics across the nation, doles out warm weekly assurances about the effectiveness of our crime-fighters. But then the nightly news comes on with stories of subway killings and innocent children being caught in the cross fire of drug shoot-outs. Uncertainty, at the very least, is inevitable, stretching from urban streets to the corridors of established institutions. Television's standard bromides are bound to be no more comforting these days than society's.

HEADLINE: POP MUSIC;
A New Respect for Folk - But Black Tie Optional

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
This Saturday at Weill Recital Hall, a sold-out house is to hear the syncopated clatter of a buckdancer, the plunk and twang of a string band and the fingerpicking guitar and train-whistle harmonica of a blues duo. The concert is produced by Carnegie Hall itself, the first of a dozen Folk Masters concerts featuring music of the Americas. It isn't the only traditional music in town; both the World Music Institute and the Ethnic Folk Arts Center will be busy this weekend presenting music from four continents. But when Carnegie Hall puts its clout behind down-home sounds, it signals a sea change among what Nick Spitzer, the folklorist who assembled the Folk Masters series, calls the "blue-chip institutions."
For those institutions, classical music in the European tradition is still their staple. But a declining classical audience, changes in urban demographics, new goals set by government and private financing sources and broader ideas of musical quality have made the world's folk music a new resource for concert-hall programmers. "This year," says Robert Browning, who runs the World Music Institute, "every institution in New York -- Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, Town Hall -- bought our mailing list." 
 "There is some pressure from foundations for presenting institutions to respond to the community that lives around them," says Ethel Raim, co-director of the Ethnic Folk Arts Center. "There is pressure to widen their programming, as well there should be."
While many academics debate the wisdom of Eurocentrism and define the late 20th century as a postcolonial era, musicians and listeners have been exploring remote styles. Recent generations were likely to hear folk songs from collectors and interpreters like Pete Seeger and John Jacob Niles, but current fans turn directly to the source. Some seek the thrill of exotica; others are looking for cultures with unmistakable roots. Record stores now have "world beat" bins, while clubs have been skimming off the styles with the closest kinship to rock, like Louisiana zydeco and West African pop.
But plenty of traditional music will never be right for the pop market. It is the music of, say, Mohawk long-house singers, who pass on tribal lore with drums, rattles and chants, or of Turkish Sufi musicians, who perform the ancient songs that help whirling dervishes achieve their ecstatic trance. One of the glories of folk music is that it is anything but a museum piece. Los Pleneros de la 21, a Puerto Rican bomba and plena group, uses age-old rhythms and poetic forms to carry up-to-date lyrics.
More often than not, traditional music is being presented on something close to its own terms -- not as a quaint sociological artifact, not adulterated for the pop market, not too gussied up for outsiders, but as vital music with rigorous standards. Fewer people are asking "But is it art?" Bluegrass fiddlers and Indian raga masters have shown there's more than one way to be a violin virtuoso. "We're trying to get rid of the idea that Western classical music is serious and everything else is entertainment," says Mr. Browning of the World Music Institute. "Many cultures don't draw a line between serious music and popular music, and when an African drummer is drumming, that is definitely serious, although it's also entertaining. But it's entertaining for me to listen to Beethoven."
Traditional music has come to 57th Street before, notably in a short-lived 1984-85 series at Carnegie Recital Hall, co-produced by Mr. Browning. But with a $225,000 budget for Folk Masters, and an additional $100,000 to record the series for broadcast next spring on American Public Radio, Carnegie Hall becomes one of New York's main presenters of traditional music, at least this year. The series includes North Carolina fishermen's sea chanteys, New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian chants, Mexican harp music and what may be the last underdiscovered accordion music of this hemisphere, Colombian vallenato. "Carnegie Hall has to reconcile multiculturalism with excellence," Mr. Spitzer says, "and folk is a great way to do it."
The Folk Masters program follows through on research and audience-building begun nationally by the Smithsonian Institution's Folklife program and the National Council for the Traditional Arts, and in New York by the Ethnic Folk Arts Center (founded as the Balkan Arts Center in 1966), the World Music Institute (which had its beginnings at the Alternative Museum in the 1970's) and smaller organizations like CityLore and the Caribbean Cultural Center. Now, major institutions are endorsing what folklorists, ethnomusicologists, musicians and fans have been saying for years: traditional styles should be prized and preserved.
Alan Lomax, the ethnographer whose "American Patchwork" documentaries enlivened the Public Broadcasting Service this season, has long advocated what he calls "cultural equity." He argues that local cultural forms should not be allowed to die out under a barrage of electronic media, because they represent survival strategies for humanity; each form that disappears is as irreplaceable as a biological species. Mr. Lomax has urged that all cultures, not just economically powerful ones, be given access to media, providing a cultural interchange instead of a one-way flow of information.
That hasn't happened yet. While pop pays for itself and jazz straggles along with occasional subsidy, the music and dance styles of the social elite -- primarily European-based classical music, ballet and modern dance -- still receive the bulk of government support. The National Endowment for the Arts current annual budget for orchestras alone is $9 million, while the entire folk-arts program, which includes crafts as well as music, receives $7 million. "In Carnegie's program book, the folk series is on page 18," says Nick Spitzer, "and it's the only page where the musicians aren't wearing evening gowns, tuxedos or black turtlenecks."
On a broader scale, home-grown styles are beleaguered by all the pressures of assimilation. Generations of immigrants and rural migrants to cities have received signals that old tunes and dances are too foreign, too lower class, too "country." Who wants to listen to grandpa's fiddle when Madonna is on TV? And who will admit to loving Serbian brass bands when the boss attends the Mostly Mozart Festival?
Luckily, traditions die hard. Because folk music is tied to the folks themselves -- to people for whom certain melodies and rhythms and dance steps measure out daily life (births, weddings, funerals) -- immigrant enclaves hold on to traditions, at least for a generation or two.
The Ethnic Folk Arts Center got started because Martin Koenig, a dancer, and Ethel Raim, a singer, loved the music of the Balkans; the music led them to the communities, where they found that preserving it meant showing immigrants that their music was prized by "Americans." From Balkan enclaves, they fanned out to Italian, Central Asian, Irish, Haitian and other communities, seeking out musicians, largely by word of mouth, and introducing them to the wider public.
The idea, Mr. Koenig says, is to bolster carriers of traditions by showing that "you can still get access to what's available in America and you don't have to give up what you come from. In fact, if you do give up what you come from, you're scarred."
The nonprofit Ethnic Folk Arts Center, whose current budget is approximately $600,000, presents about 30 concerts a year, including an annual multiethnic jamboree every September at a Queens beer garden. But its research programs, with recordings to document traditional styles, are equally important. "The hard work will still be to support musicians in the community," Ms. Raim says. "Maybe more people will have their eyes opened to the relationship between these musical forms and the community and their quality of life, but it hasn't happened yet."
The World Music Institute grew out of the Alternative Museum, a Lower East Side art gallery that later moved to TriBeCa. To use the gallery space at night, Mr. Browning brought in jazz and traditional music; by the mid-1980's, audiences grew too big for the room. Mr. Browning started the nonprofit World Music Institute in 1985, with a budget of $65,000; its annual budget is now $700,000. It presents about 70 concerts a year -- mostly ethnic music, but with some avant-garde jazz and cross-cultural experiments -- in places like Washington Square Church, Merkin Hall and Symphony Space.
Like other presenters of traditional music, Mr. Browning sees the need for a new kind of concert hall. The proscenium stages of blue-chip institutions put a distance between audience and performer and presume the seated, silent audience that goes with European styles of music.
"I'd like to see a place for 500 to 600 people maximum, with people in a semicircle, close to the musicians," Mr. Browning says. "It would have a sound system built in that would sound as natural as possible. And the performing space would also have a cafe with a dance floor. Most traditional music is people's music, and it has always been performed in the context of family, ritual, rites of passage, where food and drink are usually part of the celebration."
 Mr. Spitzer, who was the state folklorist in Louisiana and is currently a folk-life consultant to the Smithsonian, created his Folk Masters program to take the music's new context -- Weill Hall -- into account. It emphasizes solo performers and small groups rather than amplified dance bands. "Any new context you put traditional artists in strengthens them," he says. "They can say, 'I've been to Carnegie Hall,' and the echo back into communities means a lot.
"I always say cultural conservation is really cultural conversation. The only way it's going to happen is if there are ways of talking to each other between different spheres and classes. For folk traditions to survive they invariably change. The question is, who controls the change? Is the change dominated by people from outside the tradition who want to put up hothouse flowers, to say, 'Gee, we took care of that pluralistic impulse'? Or is it dominated by people from within the communities looking for ways to mediate between modern, international, multicultural, professional society and the deep sense of needing to belong to a community?
"When I look around Carnegie, at all the busts and portraits of famous composers," Mr. Spitzer adds, "they seem to me like home altars, holding all the received wisdom of the elders of the elite. But hearing this music humanizes classical music. It reminds you that everybody came from somewhere, that classical music has long drawn on the folk tradition, and folk performers have always been influenced by establishment sources. But if you only see it from the top down, then you're missing the other direction of flow."
Bringing folk music into established concert institutions represents a challenge, especially if the music is to be something more than tokenism. (It will be interesting to see whether Carnegie Hall renews the Folk Masters series next year.) Separate the music from an audience that knows how to respond -- dancing, laughing at in-jokes, recognizing a hot solo, speaking in tongues, all of which in turn cues the performers -- and the music may falter, just as a string quartet would have problems at a Cajun fais-do-do party.
But with an audience of insiders who know the music and outsiders eager to understand, folk music offers glimpses not just of different musical structures and techniques, but of different ways for musicians and listeners to share their art -- ways so old they may seem new.

ANGLO TO ZYDECO
 In celebration of its centennial, Carnegie Hall launches a 12-concert folk series this week, while New York's progenitors of folk music, the Ethnic Folk Arts Center and World Music Institute, offer a kaleidoscope of programs.
"The Americas: Traditional Music in a New World," at Carnegie's Weill Recital Hall (247-7800), showcases the musical legacies of Indian, European and African cultures in the Americas. The series opens Saturday with an evening of string-band music, barrel-house piano, tap dance and Piedmont blues with John Cephas and Phil Wiggins. Other concerts feature Cajun music, French fiddlers and a Quebecois chanteuse (Nov. 6); Colombian vallenato and Puerto Rican bomba and plena (Nov. 10); gospel (Nov. 13); cowboy poets, mountain ballads and bluegrass (Nov. 17); Hispanic string music and storytelling songs from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Louisiana (Nov. 20); African-roots music (Nov. 27); Creole music and Mexican jarcoho (Dec. 1); North American Indian song and dance (Dec. 4); zydeco and New Orleans jazz (Dec. 8); folk violin (Dec. 11), and guitar masters (Dec. 15).
The Ethnic Folk Arts Center (691-9510) introduces a "First Fridays" series this week at its Performance Space, 179 Varick Street, with a lineup that includes the Zlatne Uste Brass Band (folk dance), Wretched Refuse String Band (bluegrass) and Los Conquistadores del Sur (conjunto). The series, presented in a coffeehouse spirit, runs the first Friday of each month.
This week, the World Music Institute (545-7536) brings the sounds of India (Friday) and Turkish Sufi (Saturday) to Washington Square Church, 135 W. Fourth Street. Future concerts focus on gospel (Nov. 10 and 11) and the folk music of Russia (Nov. 16), the Mideast (Nov. 17), East Asia (Nov. 18), South India (Nov. 18), the Celts (Dec. 1), West Africa (Dec. 8), Brittany (Dec. 15) and the Andes (Dec. 22).

HEADLINE: A Directory of Cruises Worldwide;
Ships Decked Out With Amenities

BYLINE: By VERNON KIDD; VERNON KIDD frequently writes about ship travel.

 BODY:
Destination: Crown Princess. Side trips to: San Juan, St. Thomas and Nassau. More than ever, cruise ships themselves are the main attraction as sleek new vessels are launched or old ones renovated, each offering constant on-board activities, menus supervised by noted chefs and an increasing number of such amenities as soaring atriums, health clubs and sidewalk cafes.
New or refurbished ships this year will add nearly 11,000 berths, according to Cruise Lines International Association, an increase of 16 percent over 1989. As a result of this increased capacity, a cruise may be the best vacation value around, with the fall season offering the real bargains. 
 In this highly competitive environment, cruise lines are working hard to please. All the big ships launched this year were developed with amenities in mind. Princess Cruises christened its newest ship, the 70,000-ton Crown Princess, at a Brooklyn pier Sept. 25, with a thousand guests applauding as Sophia Loren shattered a bottle of champagne against the white bow. The ship has a combination observation lounge, dance floor and casino in the forward dome, her most recognizable feature, which offers a view usually reserved for the bridge. A disco is deep inside the ship on the first passenger deck next to the health club, where the sound is isolated from most of the cabins.
Between these extremes is an enclosed sun deck with two pools, indoor and outdoor Jacuzzis and a pizza parlor. In the center of the ship is a three-story atrium with waterfall surrounded by shops, as well as lounges, a nightclub, two theaters, a library, a casino that includes baccarat and roulette, a pastry shop, a piano bar and eight other bars, including one that serves caviar and wine. The ship carries 1,596 passengers, considerably fewer than most ships her size, which allows more room for the full gamut of amenities.
In March Carnival Cruise Lines introduced the 70,367-ton Fantasy, which carries 2,600 passengers; her sister ship, Ecstasy, is due next March. In addition to having a six-deck atrium with glass elevators and constantly changing lighting effects, the Fantasy offers individually controlled air-conditioning and wall safes in her cabins. Though identical in physical layout, the two ships differ in decor and theme.
On Costa Cruise Lines' new CostaMarina, the Tropicana Theater is paneled in mother-of-pearl, the Galaxy nightclub is capped by a glass dome, and huge window walls enclose three decks at the stern.
The new superships will find stiff competition from the Norway, the former France. After a major renovation supervised by the marine architect Tage Wandborg, she emerged this month with two new glass-enclosed decks, a proscenium theater now featuring the Broadway production of "Meet Me in St. Louis," 135 luxury suites and two owner's suites of 760 square feet each, said to be the largest afloat (available at $5,085 to $5,495 a person for a seven-night cruise). At 75,000 tons, the Norway remains the world's largest cruise liner. According to Douglas Falk, executive vice president of marketing for Kloster Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line's parent company, duplicating the Norway today would cost more than $500 million.

MORE emphasis, too, is being placed on entertainment, with large theaters capable of presenting Broadway musicals and revues, movie theaters with first-run films, late-night discos with light shows, and nightclubs with well-known entertainers. This year, for the first time, there will be a Newport Jazz Festival at Sea, part of Crystal Harmony's inaugural trans-Atlantic sailing on April 1. Crown Cruise Line inaugurates its newest ship, the 15,000-ton, 556-passenger Crown Monarch, next month, and "Sophisticated Ladies" will open its cabaret.
Atriums are perhaps the most striking of the new amenities. Reception areas on the larger ships have been designed as dramatic, sometimes glitzy, central meeting points that recall splashy hotel lobbies. The Nordic Empress, introduced in May by Royal Caribbean Cruises, unveiled an atrium 40 feet across and nine decks high, filled with tropical plants. A split staircase on either side is covered by a skylight, and two glass-enclosed elevators connect with each level.
Ships are offering more options for dining, with live combos and dancing, and indoor-outdoor buffets, usually on the sun deck, as an alternative to the regular dining room. A la carte restaurants, attended by master chefs, provide still more choices, some at an additional charge.
The first ship to start the trend was the Seaward in 1988, with its 82-seat Palm Tree Restaurant high up on the sun deck. On the Crystal Harmony there are two alternative restaurants: the Kyoto, specializing in a variety of Asian cuisines, and the Prego, offering Italian cuisine. Many ships also offer 24-hour room service. A name chef as consultant is almost de rigueur. Paul Bocuse supervises the menu for the Royal Viking Sun's Royal Grill, and Michel Roux is consultant chef for the multilevel dining room on Chandris Celebrity Cruises' new Horizon.
Dining rooms, instead of being placed in the middle of the ship, are now designed to offer views from floor to ceiling windows, and some are set in the front of the ship. Design innovations include split levels or balconies.
Cabins are generally somewhat roomier on the new ships, with windows instead of port holes, particularly in suites and deluxe accommodations. Private balconies, marble bathrooms with tub and shower, color television, video cassette recorders, stocked minibars, generous drawer and closet space and butler and concierge service are among the amenities offered. And although many lines have been reluctant to make the necessary changes, more new ships are at least partially accessible to the handicapped, with low sills, ramps and at least a few wheelchair-accessible cabins and bathrooms.
For the sports enthusiast and health-conscious, the seagoing spa is increasingly available, with health menus and personal exercise programs for an extra cost. There is a range of choices from gyms, saunas, fitness centers, swimming pools, whirlpools, aerobics classes, diving lessons, jogging tracks, skeet shooting, shuffleboard, tennis, golf practice areas and a popular new development, the Golf-Simulator, which by means of electronics allows passengers to "play" famous courses.
On the Norway, the health-club amenities give new dimension to Norwegian Cruise Line's slogan, "Athlete's Fleet": there are a 4,000-square-foot health and fitness center with floor-to-ceiling windows, a new 6,000-square-foot Roman spa with computer-controlled hydrotherapy baths and a jogging and walking track that encircles the 1,035-foot ship.
Not to be left out, smaller luxury-oriented ships are entering the amenities wars. For example, Seabourn Cruise Line's ships have some of the most attractive suites. They also have an observatory for stargazing, a glass-bottom port for underwater viewing and a sports platform with a steel-net-protected saltwater swimming pool for use in small coves and inlets. Even the somewhat spartan Nile River boats have been upgraded, with Swan Hellenic's new Nile Monarch offering all outside, air-conditioned accommodations with television, refrigerator, minibar, shower or bath, and a bar and pool on the partly covered sun deck. The new Renaissance Cruises' ships, numbered I to V (with more on the way), are notable for their use of hardwood paneling and brass trim in the cabins, all of which have sitting room, bedroom and marble bath with teakwood vanity. The ships carry only 100 to 114 passengers, but each has a pool, a library and a piano bar.
Reflecting the influence of the environmental movement, Salen Lindblad's Frontier Spirit, which next month will become the first expedition cruise ship to enter service in 16 years, is one of a new breed designed to leave areas unpolluted.
Despite a general flattening of American tourism, cruise operators are optimistic for 1991. The feeling is that people have become accustomed to taking an annual vacation no matter how bad the economic outlook, and those who have sailed previously are likely to continue doing so, even if it means taking a shorter cruise. The three- and four-night market is one of the fastest growing segments of the cruise industry. The larger ships, those carrying 2,000 or more passengers, are entering that market, and at least one, the Fantasy, is sailing at more than 100 percent capacity, which means that some cabins are carrying three or more passengers. While the overall growth rate may start to turn flat next year, the industry expects that when the figures are in for this year 3.7 million people will have taken a cruise. That will be an increase of 400,000 over 1989 and 525,000 over 1988, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.
The Persian Gulf crisis came at a time when the Mediterranean cruise season was drawing to a close, and there were not large numbers of cancellations. Ships operating in the area are maintaining their published schedules and taking a wait-and-see attitude, but the increase in oil prices raises the specter of possible fuel surcharges.
This, coupled with the need to fill the ships will make an interesting if naervous beginning for 1991.

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
Still Strangers: My New Neighbors Have Exotic Customs

BYLINE: By MARCIA BYALICK

 BODY:
WHEN my husband and I left Brooklyn and moved to the suburbs 17 years ago to buy a house, to own a backyard and to raise a family, I remember worrying about whether my children would suffer from growing up in such a homogeneous environment. There was no one around who looked or spoke or dressed any differently than we did.
Even though the children I grew up with in my East Flatbush neighborhood had remarkably similar backgrounds, I was always aware that a bus ride away there existed the colors and accents and economic realities of a larger world. We traveled the subways and were often exposed to the melting pot that was New York City. But I feared my children would miss the excitement, the wonder, the spiciness that comes with diversity. 
 I need not have worried. Slowly, over the years, my neighborhood has absorbed the largest Asian population on Long Island, including a sizable percentage of families of Korean, Chinese, Indian and Persian backgrounds. And while the lessons learned are quite different from the fairy-tale sharing of customs and traditions I might have wished for, they are nevertheless valuable additions to life experience.
Asian families now live in 2 of the 10 houses that surrounded mine . I grew up defining a neighbor as someone you borrowed ketchup from, shared leftover birthday cake with, and held an extra key for in case they lost theirs. I am embarrassed to admit I have never even introduced myself to these new families. I guiltily wonder if the situation were reversed and I moved to where they came from whether they would be more hospitable.
But the language barrier, the fact that we never run into one another and a hectic working-mother style of life that allows me a 10-minute phone call to my sister on a good day, puts being a warm welcoming neighbor on my permanent list of things I should try harder to accomplish.
As the names in each grade began to change, so did the roster of the school newspaper, the orchestra, the math and science honor programs and the top 5 percent of the graduating class. In addition to these achievements, I admired the great haircuts and cutting edge of fashion sense I noticed on the Asian children when I drove my kids to school.
And I wondered why my daughters never invited Myung, Indu, Manish or Haejin home. "You don't understand," they say. "We're friendly in school. But out of school, it's just different. They stay to themselves, work with their parents and go to Korean or Japanese or Chinese school on the weekends. We like each other fine. We're just different."
My new neighbors are always out of sight. Just as their children seem to disappear when they are not in school, except for those at the library, their parents seem to do no more than eat and sleep at home. I never meet them in the supermarket, at a restaurant in the cleaners.
 They are still tied to their "old neighborhood," and like all new minorities resist assimilation by clustering together in self-enforced ghettos. Many of the homes house three generations, with grandma fulfilling the role of the family's "wife." She walks the young children to school, does the laundry and makes dinner. Rarely does she speak any English. Although her life may be comfortable in the beautiful home that the 100-hour workweek her children put in affords, I wonder how she handles the alienation and the loneliness. And I wonder how she feels seeing her grandchildren wearing Bart Simpson T-shirts and listening to heavy-metal music.
Of course, not every Asian child plays the violin and wins Westinghouse Scholarships. I have noticed the price paid by some who are less accomplished, who need more supervision. Years ago my daughter told me of the existence of the O.D.S., the Oriental Domination Society, a gangthat cut classes, smoked in the courtyard and encouraged the spread of scary myths about themselves.
This last year the neighborhood was shocked by the brutal murder of a Korean boy and the vicious stabbing of his sister by a 17-year-old who gave as his motive that he was spoken to disrespectfully. It was the knowledge we gleaned from the press of this tragedy that gave those of us who live down the block and around the corner our first opportunity to reach out and behave like neighbors.
 It's going to take a while before any "melting" goes on in the pot that makes up my community. I admire my new neighbors for their courage. I can't imagine what it must be like for them negotiating the frantic frustrating Long Island Expressway, confronting a new alphabet and trying to keep tradition intact while at the same time assimilating into a wildly different culture. I hope that one day life slows down just a bit for all of us, so that the similarities between us become as obvious -- and praiseworthy -- as our differences.

HEADLINE: Abandonment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The real estate industry seems to have the same answer -- higher rents -- for New York's housing problems no matter what the question is. Now that the 1980's real estate boom is over, landlord groups are threatening building abandonment because of rising operating costs. ("Will Landlords Desert Their Buildings Again?", The New York Times Week in Review, Sept. 30.)
While it is true that some costs have risen recently, New York City's tenants have been much harder hit by the slowdown in the local economy. Yet we don't see any articles about tenants refusing to meet their already inflated rent bills.
Operating cost increases in the 1980's were extremely limited, interest rates fell and the local economy boomed. During all this time, the city's Rent Guidelines Board granted rent increases far in excess of the amount that would have been necessary to compensate landlords for increased operating costs, and widespread major capital improvements allowed enormous jumps in rent. These factors resulted in massive increases in real estate values, which were quickly siphoned off through sales, refinanceing and co-op conversion.
New York's lower- and middle-income tenants have been subsidizing landlords for years enabling some of them to reach the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans. It's about time that landlords put some of this wealth back into the buildings which have made them rich and famous.

HEADLINE: Apartments Designed For Pragmatic Goals Economics Holds Key to Esthetics

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
On East 72d Street a new apartment tower of red brick, bristling with balconies, is nearing completion. It is ringed by decorative courses, with an amply arched entrance at the base, and the four great lanterns at its top are soon to be illuminated, vaguely recalling the residential skyscrapers of the early 20th century.
Thirty-three blocks to the south, work is about to begin on a new apartment tower of green glass, with no balconies at all. Sleekly devoid of ornamentation, it will have a sheer curtain wall and a flat top that repudiate the architectural trend of post-modern historicizing. 
 These buildings' differences and similarities illuminate the way in which the marketplace, the government and the developer shape an apartment building. And what makes the contrast between them instructive is that both were designed by the 87-year-old family firm of Emery Roth & Sons.
Beginning in 1903 with the Hotel Belleclaire, at Broadway and 77th Street, the Roth firm produced chunky red-brick flats, encrusted in decoration; then limestone and buff-brick buildings in Renaissance Revival and Art Deco styles during the 20's and 30's (epitomized by the San Remo on Central Park West, between 74th and 75th Streets); bulky, boxy, white-brick piles in the 50's (exemplified by 215 East 68th Street, at Second Avenue) and the freestanding apartment skyscrapers that began to rise in the 60's.
Now Roth has designed the red-brick Oxford at 422 East 72d Street, near York Avenue, a 46-story tower with 204 condominium units. It is being built by Burton P. Resnick of Jack Resnick & Sons. And Roth also is designing the green-glass tower, St. James's Plaza, at 240 East 39th Street, near Second Avenue, with 250 condominium units. It is being developed by Peter deSavary and Michael Sarch.
If there has been a uniting principle behind these works, it is economic -- not esthetic.
The Roth family has always been candid on this point, to judge from an Emery Roth axiom quoted in "Mansions in the Clouds," Steven Ruttenbaum's 1986 book on the architect:
"The primary purpose of building apartment houses is to create the best possible return on the investment. A building that does not pay is poor architecture, no matter how interesting the design, costly the construction or clever the layout."
Today, Emery's grandson, Richard Roth Jr., says: "There is no way a developer will not want to build what he's entitled to. What he's paying for the land is based on the maximum F.A.R. he can build."
A floor-area ratio for an apartment building might range as high as 12-to-1 in some areas of Manhattan. That means, for example, that a 20,000-square-foot lot can contain a building with 240,000 square feet of space. The mass of the building, however, can be arranged very differently. If the structure covers 80 percent of the lot (16,000 square feet), it could have 15 floors. If it covers 40 percent of the lot (8,000 square feet), it could have 30 floors.
Richard Roth designed New York's "first sheer tower residence," as the 35-story Tower East apartment building advertised itself in 1962. The site takes up a full blockfront on Third Avenue, between 71st and 72d Streets, but above a one-story commercial base, the tower occupies only 25 percent of the lot area.
The tendency in zoning today is to discourage that tower-in-a-plaza approach and encourage lower, bulkier structures that are meant to reinforce the existing physical context of a neighborhood. Nonetheless, Mr. Roth said, tall towers have adherents.
"View seems to be an important sales point," he said. "Towers are popular and seem to sell to a particular group of people."
The Oxford reflects the older tower-in-a-plaza approach, particularly in the asymmetrical front it presents to 72d Street. The eastern part of the tower comes almost to the lot line but the western part is set back behind a deep plaza. That open space generated part of the building bonus that allowed the Oxford to rise as high as it does.
The plaza bonus is available in an R-10 zoning district, which applies to the north half of the lot on which the Oxford was built. The southern half of the lot is within a lower-density R-8 district and that portion of the building facing 71st Street is about half as high as the 72d Street side.
Had the Oxford's overall bulk been evenly distributed across the two zoning districts, the building would have had only 20 to 22 stories. But such a structure would have "overburdened" the R-8 zone and "underburdened" the R-10, Mr. Roth said. "Zoning really guided the tall tower," he said.
As city planners have shaped exteriors, the City Council has shaped interiors -- particularly with Local Law 58 of 1987, which requires that new residential construction be accessible to physically handicapped persons. "Kitchens are bigger today because of handicapped requirements," Mr. Roth said.
KITCHENS are also assuming a bigger role in people's lives. "Windowed kitchens are a big selling point," Mr. Roth said. "People are eating in more, doing more entertaining at home. I think entertainment space in an apartment is very important. There are large living rooms and smaller bedrooms."
Closets, however, have not been the same since the 50's. "The minute the bi-fold door was invented, closets got smaller," Mr. Roth said. "The walk-in closet disappeared."
Finishes in apartments, he said, are generally getting "cheaper and cheaper," in part because of the expectation that they will not be retained by purchasers. "Twenty to 30 percent in most buildings will come in and change things radically," Mr. Roth said. "You may offer them marble floors for the foyer or bathrooms, but most people will generally bring in their own marble, gut them and start over."
Within the last decade, Mr. Roth said, a practice has emerged in which layouts are designed to be different, with larger apartments on the upper floors, rather than being duplicated throughout a structure.
"At the top of buildings," he said, "apartments get to be more expensive. Therefore, the areas should be bigger. To pay more, you should get more, besides the views." The strategy seems to be attracting buyers. "The first apartments to go are at the top of the scale and at the bottom," Mr. Roth said.
One of the most obvious features -- the balcony -- is regarded as an asset by some builders, a liability by others. Take the case of Roth's two latest towers.
"Burt Resnick presses our architects for the maximum amount of outdoor space possible," said Dennis P. Brady, vice president of the Resnick concern, builders of the Oxford. "It's something people like. We feel it's a valuable asset and, if it were up to us, every apartment would have one."
But the lawyer for the developers of St. James's Plaza, Peter Siviglia, said: "We think they detract from the elegance of the structure, especially here, where you have a tall, slender, graceful building. It's a combination of the air quality in Manhattan and the fact that balconies -- of necessity -- aren't that large, so they aren't that functional."
Balconies are not the only things separating St. James's Plaza and the Oxford, which have utterly different facades.
"A tall, elegant curtain-wall building in this location is extremely attractive," Mr. Siviglia said. "We're going to be 56 stories high. A curtain wall will add a sense of grace and lightness to something that tall, as opposed to a brick building."
But bricks were called for at the Oxford. "This is a classic New York brick building," Mr. Roth said. "It is more traditional because Resnick is a more traditional builder." At the urging of the Roth office, Resnick also added bands of cast-stone decorative courses under the window sills. "You do want to give a building some distinguishing features," Mr. Brady said.
St. James's Plaza, which has a series of setbacks, is flat-topped. But the Oxford culminates in a bulkhead topped by four large lanterns at each corner that are soon to be illuminated. "We have been very interested in doing something with the top of the building," Mr. Brady said. "Maybe it's back to 'Mansions in the Clouds.' It's something that should be somewhat distinctive. I would hope for people to say: 'Oh, the Oxford. That's the one with the beautiful lights on top.' "
Prices at the Oxford begin at $250,000 for the least expensive studio apartment, with one-bedroom units beginning at $287,000 and two-bedroom units at $395,000. The developers of St. James's Plaza are not yet ready to make their price list public, Mr. Siviglia said.
No one would mistake the Oxford for the beacon-topped San Remo, but it does have more flourishes than most of Roth's postwar buildings, a number of which were built for the family development concern once led by Samuel Rudin and now headed by his sons, Jack and Lewis.
AMONG nearly two dozen structures designed by the Roth office for the Rudins were such archetypal, white-brick apartments houses as 215 East 68th Street, which looks as antiseptic as a hospital pavilion.
Although white brick is long out of fashion, Jack Rudin still rises to its defense, in explaining why it was preferred at the time.
"White brick was a glazed brick, the most expensive brick around," he said. "Red brick was cheaper. White brick was brighter, more reflective, more attractive. Red brick looked like a housing project." And Mr. Roth said, "It's not white brick that's the devil, it's the lack of articulation or decoration."
Besides that, Mr. Rudin added, a discussion of facades misses the point of Roth's workings. "They believe in designing buildings from the inside out," the developer said. "Usability comes first. Layout is everything. That is what's going to get leases renewed in the future. That is the product."
As for esthetics, Mr. Rudin said, the idea has always been "keeping it simple," to help hold down both construction and maintenance costs. "We are manufacturers of apartment buildings," he said. "We have to price apartments so they will rent. What good is having an architectural monument that doesn't rent?"

HEADLINE: Perspective: Zoning;
Controlling Scale Near Historic Districts

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THERE is an uncomfortable relationship between New York City's zoning law and its historic districts. The shape and scale of the building that zoning permits is frequently considered inappropriate to the already-built environment that the district seeks to preserve and enhance.
The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission can insist on a satisfactory design within the district -- often in lengthy and contentious negotiations -- but it is powerless to encourage "sympathetic" buildings outside the districts. Jarringly contrasting specimens of new construction have emerged just outside some historic districts. 
 Last week the Municipal Art Society, whose president, Kent Barwick, is a former chairman of the landmarks agency, came forth with a far-ranging zoning proposal designed to correct these presumed deficiencies. The proposals appear in a study called "Zoning and Historic Districts," prepared for the Planning Center of the Municipal Art Society by the planning firm of Abeles Phillips Preiss & Shapiro.
The cover of the report carries a photograph of the immense tower that Citicorp has built in the downtown commercial center of Long Island City, juxtaposed in the background with the old stone-stooped town houses of the Hunters Point Historic District in the foreground.
The body of the report mentions the straight-tower Madison Green condominium on Broadway just south of Madison Square, near the Ladies Mile Historic District, and One Pierrepont Plaza, the office building that Morgan Stanley & Company, the Wall Street investment house, built on land acquired from the city on the border of the Brooklyn Heights historic district, as examples of what it considers inappropriate structures near historic districts.
Mr. Barwick described the report as a discussion paper rather than a policy statement by the society. It is an outgrowth of the Historic City Committee's 1989 report, "New York: the Historic City," and it breaks new ground in its ideas on the substance and process of rezoning to strengthen historic-district preservation by forcing new development to conform to shapes and sizes of the past.
The zoning proposals are predicated on furthering the fairly one-dimensional goal of design conformity to past forms. The report advocates, for example, the mapping of "contextual" zones within and around historic districts, in what are described as transition areas. The contextual zones, already mapped in many of the city's residential locations, would be extended to manufacturing districts and other areas where office buildings and commercial facilities can be built.
The report suggests the elimination of plazas, arcades and urban open-space bonuses in historic districts. It proposes the adaptation of zoning within districts to the already-built style. It would introduce absolute height controls into historic districts, a direct approach that New York City zoning so far has avoided. The concept would probably render unbuildable various projects long in planning, among them the Milstein Properties office building on the border of the South Street Seaport Historic District.
The study also calls for institutionalizing the working relationship between the landmarks agency and the Department of City Planning. Staff officials should meet regularly to discuss the zoning requirements of the districts, the report says.
IN an interview, John R. Fawcett, the project manager of the study, and Brian Kintish, the project manager for Abeles Phillips, elaborated on the recommendations. The original director of the study, Carol Clark, has left the Municipal Art Society to become assistant executive director for intergovernmental relations in the Department of City Planning.
"The zoning in historic districts is not suited to what realistically can be built there," said Mr. Kintish. "What the zoning allows is usually nothing that the Landmarks Commission would or should approve."
Around a historic district such as Ladies Mile west of Madison Square Park in Manhattan, for example, they advocate a contextual zone that would encourage buildings to rise about eight stories from the streetline and then step back sharply through the use of both a front and rear sky-exposure plane. The sky-exposure plane determines the sunlight and shadow that a building allows to reach the street. It is used as a control on the shape and size of buildings.
Critics say current formulas sometimes lead to excessive open-space requirements, and consequently excessive building height to achieve permissible floor area. Others point out that severe height limitations would indirectly impose severe use limitations as well, and thus restrict redevelopment of the land.
A specific example of a building near a historic district that was shaped by an excessive open-space requirement, the planners say, is the Memphis, a 20-story 80-unit apartment house built in the 80's at 140 Charles Street, west of the Greenwich Village Historic District.
Its architect, Bernard Rothzeid, agreed that he would have preferred a more compatible 12-story building, but he said the above-ground open-space requirements of the zoning law at the time forbade it. "Many people gnashed their teeth at what we built," he said, "but surprisingly it's not that bad."
In the city's Planning Department it is pointed out that under housing quality zoning adopted since the Memphis was built the open-space requirements could be waived.
Whether Citicorp Center in Long Island City or the Morgan Stanley building in Brooklyn Heights would have gone forward at all under contextual zoning requirements proposed in the study is questionable. Both were projects widely hailed as keeping thousands of office jobs in New York City.
But the Planning Center's study is not concerned with economic or locational planning goals. It implies a willingness to mandate flat, bulky building shapes in central commercial districts in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens for the first time, possibly reducing redevelopment opportunities by narrowing flexibility by developers.
An example of this effort occurred last year, when the City Planning Department itself proposed a contextual C6-1A zones adjacent to the Brooklyn Heights Historic District. Mr. Kintish was project director for the study in the Brooklyn office of the Planning Department.
The land is along Court Street from Atlantic Avenue to Livingston Street, potentially a future office-development location. Currently it is a general-purpose commercial district zoned C6-1, allowing a maximum floor-area ratio, or F.A.R., of six.
The Planning Commission adopted the recommendation. But Community Board 2, the Brooklyn Heights Association and Borough President Howard Golden opposed it in the Board of Estimate and it was withdrawn.
The Borough President's office said that Mr. Golden felt that the zone would be detrimental to new office or commercial development. With an extreme height limitation, multiplex movie theaters might be buildable, and this might emerge on Court Street in any event. In areas where it is planning policy to encourage headquarters-oriented office growth and the job growth that goes with it, developers will look for height in new buildings to justify land costs. The contextual low-rise office building in a high-land-cost location in Manhattan is not a probable new-building form. Accordingly, transitional zones around such actual or potential historic districts as Ladies Mile, SoHo or NoHo would in effect restrict redevelopment opportunities.
There are currently no contextual zones in locations that have been developed with office buildings, city planners said. Nor are they prepared to criticize a building such as One Pierrepont Plaza, which many consider remarkably contextual for a high-density building and a successful design compromise between the residential and commercial character of the location.
In any event, the Municipal Art Society study is one of many serious zoning proposals that can be expected in the months to come. Others most likely will be community-sponsored, with help from the newly expanded planning offices of the Borough Presidents. Each has a specific agenda rather than a balanced and comprehensive planning objective.
And while there is an argument for compatibility of building types, there is also an argument for preserving flexibility is design so that New York City can remain competitive for both commercial and residential occupancy. Balancing these objectives is the task of the City Planning Commission.

HEADLINE: Focus: Corporate Transfers;
The Struggle to Sell Employees' Houses

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: WILMINGTON , DEL.

 BODY:
IT'S tough enough to have one house to sell these days. But America's largest companies are ending up with hundreds, as the stagnant real-estate market swells their inventories of houses they buy from employees they are relocating.
E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, , which moves 4,000 employees a year, has watched its inventories double in Delaware and Pennsylvania in the last year, to 160 houses. To sell those houses without driving prices down further, Du Pont has adopted a program of incentives to lure home buyers, including low-interest mortgages and a chance to win prizes just by looking at a house. 
 Buyer incentives and other ways of coping with the soft real estate market were a major topic at the fall meeting of the Employee Relocation Council held last week in Los Angeles.
"Dealing with high inventories certainly is a concern," said Anita Brienza, communications director with the thousand-member relocation council.
Du Pont is not alone. Eastman Kodak Company has also seen its stockpile in of houses in the Rochester area double, and its national inventory increase by 10 to 20 percent. And at ICI Americas, the United States arm of the international chemical giant, the company, which is based here, is now carrying 58 houses, compared with half that number a year ago.
Still, the sluggish real estate market has not cut down on the number of corporate transfers, according to Ms. Brienza, who said that some companies move more than a thousand employees each year.
Transfers this year are at about last year's level, she said, although 1989's activity was down somewhat from a peak the year before.
"Companies view it as a cost of doing business," Ms. Brienza said. "It's worth it to them to get their first choice on the job. They're making an investment in employees."
The cost of relocation can be large, averaging $50,000 for each employee moved. Steven E. Rogers, supervisor of corporation relocation for Du Pont, which has its headquarters here, said that cost is "certainly" a concern." But Du Pont is in the business to make sure the right people are in the right jobs," he said.
The chemical company's program of buying houses from employees it was relocating began in the recession of 1974, when the market was also sluggish. Kodak began its program in the mid-60's. According to the Relocation Council, 84 percent of the council's members now either buy an employee's house during a transfer or assign it to a relocation company like Prudential Relocation Management of White Plains, N.Y., up from from 48 percent in 1974.
"We want to take that worry off the employees, because worry takes away from productivity," said Mr. Rogers. "You can't put a value on it, but we believe it makes a difference for the company and the employees."
Under most programs the company offers to buy a house for the average of two or three appraisals. Many programs allow the employee a certain period, generally 60 days, to sell the house independently or with a broker. Some companies discourage employees from trying to market the house themselves.
"WE don't want them improperly marketing the property," said Thomas B. McLaughlin, assistant manager for finance and real estate for ICI Americas.
Corporate real estate managers say that in the current unstable market they are having difficulty getting employees to accept appraisals of their house as accurate. Similarly, the relocation council says that assessments are a key concern of employees today as well.
"They think the appraisals are low ball," said Warren Dungee, property manager for Du Pont.
For that reason, some companies tell employees that if they find a buyer at a better price themselves or through a broker, the company will step in and handle complications of the closing once a contract is signed.
COMPANIES also offer loss protection plans that reimburse employees for capital improvements they have made to their properties. Under some programs, the company will pay 100 percent of the cost of major additions, and 50 percent of luxury improvements, like swimming pools.
Once a house becomes the property of a company, the carrying costs can be substantial -- 1 or 2 percent of its price a month, by the industry's rule of thumb. This includes interest charges, taxes, maintenance and repairs. Nearly all the companies make whatever repairs are needed to put the house in move-in condition.
While houses Du Pont owns in Louisiana, Oklahoma and other oil-patch states are beginning to move after a few rough years, the properties it and other companies are holding in the Northeast are becoming harder to sell.
"We're taking a major loss in Rochester," said Mee Wing, director of corporate relocation for Kodak. "The Northeast is bad."
For this reason, companies are starting to offer incentives to buyers. The Du Pont company recently announced a special program to sell its stockpile of homes in Delaware and Pennsylvania. The purpose of the incentive program, the company says, is to sell homes without bringing prices down throughout the community.
Buyers of a Du Pont home in Pennsylvania and Delaware will be eligible for below-market financing through a mortgage company with which Du Pont has made a special arrangement.
Anyone who even tours a Du Pont home is eligible for a drawing for a free trip to Cancun, Mexico, and real estate agents who show a corporate listing will have their names in a drawing for a $10,000 prize.
While some homeowners have complained that this use of the financial muscle of a Fortune 500 company leaves them at a disadvantage, real estate agents praise such programs as the only way to keep a community's price structure from tumbling.
In any case, the incentives are working: Du Pont has sold a house a day since the program was announced earlier this month.
"It's put people in the looking mode," said Daniel B. Henderson, director of corporate relocation with Gilpin, Van Trump & Montgomery Inc., a real estate agency in Wilmington.
Du Pont first tried the incentives program in Hobbs, N.M., where Conoco, the company's oil subsidiary, has an operation. Since it was begun in the early summer, 45 of the company's 65 homes in Hobbs have been sold, most within two months, said Anneta Cheney, associate broker with Newman & Company in Hobbs.
The Hobbs real estate market, which fluctuates with the oil-based local economy, has been depressed since 1982. Prices were "devastated" when many of the oil companies pulled out back then, Mrs. Cheney said.
Many of the companies simply told their employees to "slash prices," she said, with the result that values throughout the area went down.
Incentives are a much more community-minded approach, she said.
"Activity breeds activity," Mrs. Cheney said, adding that home shoppers "might start out by looking at a corporate listing and end up buying a house with no special financing."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: 875 Third Avenue;
No Longer That 'Building Behind the Liquor Store'

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
TO say that it has taken a very long time to complete 875 Third Avenue may be understating the matter a bit.
As Madison Equities began assembling the development site, between 52d and 53d Streets, Lyndon B. Johnson was in the White House, a five-room apartment in the Imperial House on East 69th Street rented for $675, Rogers Peet and De Pinna were selling on Fifth Avenue and a new musical called "Hair" was playing on Broadway. Subway riders were paying 20 cents and looking forward to a new Second Avenue line. 
 Today, in a different world, steps are finally being taken to finish 875 Third Avenue. Within the past few weeks bulldozers have cleared away the last of four small tenements at the southeast corner of 53d Street. On that site is to be built an open-air, granite-paved plaza, flanked by a one-story extension of an existing cafe, including outdoor seating, and by a planting area, pergola and new entrance to the IND subway station.
Robert Gladstone, a partner in the family-run Madison Equities concern, said he expects the plaza to be open in 1991, meaning that 875 Third Avenue will have taken 24 years from beginning to end.
The heart of the project, a 29-story office tower with 667,000 square feet, was built eight years ago. Major tenants include Grey Entertainment and Media, and the law firms of Debevoise & Plimpton, Fish & Neave and Sidley & Austin.
"We have never had a vacancy in the building except for 10,000 square feet for two months," Mr. Gladstone said. "Tenants in the building have grown, renewed their leases and are very happy."
But the overall development of the site has long been held up by Ryan's liquor store at 873 Third Avenue, whose proprietor made it plain that he would settle for nothing less than a small fortune -- more than $20 million, as Mr. Gladstone recalled it -- to vacate the building before the lease ran out in 1992.
Rather than pay the price, Madison Equities decided in 1980 to proceed with a tower that would wrap around No. 873 and its three companions. The Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed one of the more unusual office buildings in New York: a 14-sided structure whose long axis is turned at a 45-degree angle to the avenue.
That angle created a 6,400-square-foot notch to accommodate the little cluster of tenements. As originally planned, they were eventually to be replaced by a two-story, 11,000-square-foot, glass-enclosed shopping pavilion, joined to the concourse at the base of the new tower. "We thought Third Avenue would develop as a great retail thoroughfare," Mr. Gladstone said.
After the tower was finished, the shabby and diminutive tenements looked more conspicuous than ever. Although Ryan's was not quite in the league of celebrated holdouts like P. J. Clarke's saloon at Third Avenue and 55th Street, Mr. Gladstone said his family "heard a lot of jokes about how we owned the building behind the liquor store."
"We finally gave them cash in 1988," he said. At that time, the cost of the buyout had shrunk to $3 million.
By then, it was also clear that Third Avenue's retail potential was limited, so Madison Equities chose instead to build a plaza, designed by David Kenneth Specter of Manhattan. The developers are not losing rentable area by sacrificing the pavilion. Instead, space on the sixth floor that was to have been used for the pavilion's cooling equipment will be given over to commercial tenancy.
Was it worth the wait? "You've got to think in the long term," Mr. Gladstone said. "And a great entrance has long-term value."
Almost everything about 875 Third Avenue requires a long-term perspective. It was in late 1967 that Mr. Gladstone's parents, Lucille and Kenneth, and their partner, Edwin J. Glickman, began assembling parcels on the block between Third and Second Avenues, 52d and 53d Streets. They had just built the 45-story Excelsior, at 57th Street and Second Avenue, which was then the tallest apartment building in New York.
WHAT they had in mind for their next venture were cooperative apartment towers on both avenues, one of them 50 stories tall. Between them were to be four-story, one-family town houses, priced up to $500,000. The project would have increased the residential density on the block sixfold.
By 1971 they controlled about half the block. But resistance was growing. The opposition was led by the East 50's Association, which The New York Times described as a "group of newly militant residents hitherto dedicated mainly to tree-planting."
"Who is Mr. Glickman to decide what makes a better community?" demanded Marion Reider, president of the association. Residents complained of harassment, misrepresentation and secrecy on the part of site assemblers hired by Madison Equities. They also assailed the developers for placing drug addicts in vacant apartments. Mr. Gladstone said the drug abusers were pregnant, unwed women under the supervision of a social worker. Their placement on the block, he said, was part of his family's ongoing charitable work for Odyssey House.
Neighbors also worried that the Third Avenue site would be used for commercial development, threatening the area's residential quality. In response, Mr. Glickman said in 1971, "Anybody who proposed another office high-rise on Third Avenue now should have his head examined."
As efforts to assemble and empty the block bogged down in the mid-70's, so did the economy. And in 1976, with the city in the middle of a fiscal crisis, Mr. Glickman announced that "we've put the block development plan on the shelf, so to speak."
"By the end of the 1970's, the market changed precipitously to office buildings, which is what my preference is," Mr. Gladstone said. Ground was broken in 1980.
A year later, Madison Equities reached an agreement with the city: the developers would build a retail arcade on the mezzanine level of the 53d Street subway station, together with new entrances to the station. In exchange, they would be allowed a bonus of 90,000 square feet in the office building.
The developers were required to keep certain space vacant in the tower until they had either completed the subway project or demonstrated that they had tried to buy out the lease holders in the tenements, which stood above and impeded the subway improvement project.
City officials contended that the 28th and 29th floors constituted the space that was to be withheld. But the Gladstones believed they had more leeway to choose, and kept the third, fourth and fifth floors off the market. When it came to light in 1983 that the top two floors had been rented, a legal battle began.
"THIS is a classic case of a developer, once he gets approval for his plans, looking to get out of his agreements," said Philip Hess, then counsel to the Planning Commission chairman. "If the city can't prevail in a situation like this, you have to believe it's open season. If that's the way developers are treating promises made to the city, I don't think we have a workable system."
"I think I'm being horsed around with," Mr. Gladstone said at the time. "We always thought we were doing everything in cooperation with the city. We are providing more amenities than anyone else I know about. And we have already completed everything except the subway, which we're working on. That's what makes this ridiculous."
The matter was settled in December 1983, when the developers agreed to pay the city $750,000 in damages and formally apologize.
Mr. Gladstone prefers now to emphasize cooperation instead of contention, saying that city planners had been "very helpful" in the final redesign of the project.
Mrs. Reider, who stays active in community affairs, said she still wishes the Gladstones had built an apartment building rather than an office tower. But she also said: "I think they've been good neighbors at 875 to the community. I think we find it an asset having the stores there. It's a nice building and I think they try very hard to maintain it."

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
Entrepreneurs Offer an Answer

BYLINE: By RONALD S. COOPER; Ronald S. Cooper is managing partner of the Long Island office of Ernst & Young, the Big Six accounting firm.

 BODY:
IN the late 80's, when many people on Long Island were enjoying the luxurious life, we were lulled into a false sense of security. The seeds of our current problems were all there.
The Shoreham debacle was occurring, with our politicians' jumping on the bandwagon of hysteria, and our business leaders did not take enough initiatives to stem the rising ride. In my opinion, the closing of Shoreham will one day be marked as the single worst event that affected the Island's economy. 
 Our real-estate values climbed at a dizzy pace, closing out many of our sons and daughters from returning to Long Island and making it extremely difficult to attract employees. Manufacturers found it increasingly difficult to maintain their labor force, and many operations moved out of state or offshore.
Affordable housing became a buzzword, and indeed a number of initiatives were started. But it became apparent that such initiatives, while important, could not readily solve the issue. We had difficult transportation issues, and taxes were increasing.
Through it all, I remained relatively optimistic. After all was said, we were still one of the most affluent areas in the country. Although I believed our economy had peaked, it did not appear to me that we were in an all-out recession.
Indeed, I saw a number of opportunities for Long Island, with our high-tech base and the entrepreneurial spirit that seems pervasive.
We now have focused on the issues and, whether we like it or not, they must be addressed. And we are beginning. In the private sector, organizations like the Long Island Association and the Long Island Forum for Technology have taken leadership roles, not only in attacking issues but also in suggesting solutions. Our politicians have awakened to the facts of the day and are striving to provide initiatives. I applaud them all, but there is a tremendous amount of work ahead.
The negativism that we have become used to will continue in the short term. Long Islanders are beginning to hurt. Newspapers have reported that foreclosures on Island homes have doubled since last year, and there are a number of developers in serious trouble. Banks are pulling back because of large loan losses, principally in real estate.
Retailers are feeling the pinch because consumers are afraid to spend. Companies continue to explore leaving Long Island. The New York City economy, to which we are tied in many ways, is on the decline, with little prospect for immediate improvement.
All of this erodes our tax base, making it more difficult for our governments to provide services and, on top of that, to continue to offer economic incentives for companies to stay or be attracted to the Island. Law firms are beginning to set up or to enlarge their insolvency practices. The talk has turned from, "I wish I didn't have to read about all our problems," to, "We are in deep trouble and we are not going to get out of it for a number of years."
The awareness of our problems is only the beginning. We must use initiatives in a unified way. And it is the business community that must lead. We must realize that we are a region in change, and we have to quicken the pace of the change.
I believe that our future lies in turning Long Island into a high-tech think tank. We have the talent, we have a good base of high-tech companies and we have the research sites.
Initiatives have already begun. As an example, biotechnology has become a buzzword. The Association for Commerce and Industry has begun an initiative with the new Biotech Association.
Considering all the resources on the Island, I believe that biotechnology companies will help boost our economy. But it is not the key, nor is it the single most important ingredient to return to past successes.
I believe that the key will be to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit that has brought us our past successes. We must formulate a program that attracts and retains entrepreneurs with the vision to turn small companies into large companies.
My accounting firm recently conducted its Entrepreneur of the Year program. We visited more than 75 companies, and I can report that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well on Long Island. They were basically not manufacturing companies, but their entrepreneurs have either created new ideas, breathed life into old companies or found a market niche that could be exploited. They are not leaving Long Island.
While they understand the issues, they uniformly are anxious to stay. And their ranks number in the hundreds, if not the thousands. They are the future of Long Island.
Whether they are biotechnology companies, computer-software companies, financial-service companies, retailers or plain nuts-and-bolts companies, they are here will be the backbone of the economy for many years.
I have a theory that everything is cyclical. I look at Long Island like a forest fire. In a fire, old trees burn and new seedlings are given life. Over the years, the forest is rejuvenated.
That is what will happen to Long Island. New companies will be born, companies like Computer Associates, which started not that many years ago and is now a giant of its industry.
People with the entrepreneurial spirit working at declining large companies will leave them to start their own. Other forces will foster their development.
Real-estate values will decline to the point where they become affordable to the people we are trying to attract. Our politicians will streamline government because they will have to reduce taxes or else find re-election difficult. We will support initiatives like the Calverton airport, and perhaps one day we will travel on an eight-lane Long Island Expressway.
Certainly focusing attention on these budding companies helps to provide an optimistic feeling. While I think we have enough business groups, we must allow initiatives of organizations to foster growth in industries like biotechnology. Local governments must strengthen the initiatives already started to attact young companies and to foster entrepreneurs who are already here.
Entrepreneurs are capital hungry. It would be wonderful if Long Island, through a partnership of the corporate, banking and public sectors, could set up an Entrepreneur Superfund. This fund could recycle capital to entrepreneurs and serve as an important hook to attract entrepreneurs. I know this concept has many pitfalls, but we must think in terms of new thoughts and innovations.
I continue to remain optimistic about Long Island, but not in the very near term. We have been traveling along the economic highway at 100 miles an hour; we are now doing 70. That is not so bad, but the reduction in speed is apparent and troubling. I believe that, if we all pull together, the cycle will return us to being the state's economic engine.

HEADLINE: Proposal on Ballot Backed for L.I.

 BODY:
There are few who would argue that one of the most important issues to be faced for our future is the protection and preservation of our natural environment. This is especially pertinent on Long Island, where our economic and individual survival is dependent upon the protection of our underground aquifer, the only source of drinking water for 2.6 million residents in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and on the preservation of our environmentally sensitive lands.
In my four years in the State Legislature, I have seen and continue to see an ever-increasing awareness of, and commitment to, protecting the health of our environment by the citizens of New York State. 
 Recognition of the importance of Long Island's environmentally sensitive watershed areas, like the pine barrens in Suffolk and the Oyster Bay and North Hills Special Groundwater Protection Areas in Nassau, has been particularly strong. Accordingly, all levels of government have responded by implementing a variety of measures that attempt to safeguard these most important and necessary natural areas.
In fact, the preservation of our precious natural resources -- our environment -- is no longer a luxury to be taken for granted, but is now recognized as an individual obligation and a governmental responsibility. Toward this end, programs that bring such lands into public ownership are of great significance.
In a year in which there could be no agreement on a number of notable issues, the State Legislature overwhelmingly passed, and the Governor signed into law, the 21st Century Environmental Quality Bond Act. Itwill appear as Proposal One on the statewide ballot Election Day.
If we are to preserve our irreplaceable natural and historic heritage, create and improve our municipal parks, provide assistance to local municipalities for closing unsafe landfills, safely handle medical waste and domestic sewage and establish regional recycling facilities, each of us must take affirmative action when we enter the voting booth this year.
For a cost of less than 2 cents a person a day, we will have come one step closer to leaving a living legacy for future generations of New Yorkers.
Vote 'Yes' on Proposal One.

HEADLINE: Northeast Notebook: Burlington, Mass.;
Small Town, Huge Project

 BODY:
A COMPUTER software company has leased 70,000 square feet of space space in Burlington Center, a large mixed-use project with five office buildings that is rising in this town of 23,000 people 15 miles north of Boston.
The company, Easel Corporation of Woburn, Mass., will move into the first of the buildings, a $21 million four-story, 125,000-square-foot concrete, granite and glass structure now nearing completion. The building was designed by the Urban Design Group of Chicago.
Trammell Crow Company of Dallas, the developer of the $95 million project, is planning 635,000 square feet of office space, 35,000 square feet of retail space and 75 to 100 town- house units. Construction of the town houses is to begin next year, said Richard A. Galvin, vice president of Trammell Crow's Boston office, but no date has been set for the remaining buildings.
Planning for Burlington Center began in 1984 when the developer proposed an office park of about 1 million square feet. The town denied the permit, objecting that the project was too large.
The developer went to court but decided instead to become the first to use a local planning tool introduced in 1987, the Planned Development District, which allows a variety of uses on land zoned for a single use on a case-by-case basis.
Trammell Crow, town officials and abutting residents came up with the final design, which includes housing on land zoned for industrial use. The plan added the retail and residential space and, at the town's request, extensive traffic, sewer and drainage improvements. The plan was approved in January 1988.
There was little commercial or industrial development here until the 1970's. Since then, businesses and institutions have been attracted by the abundance of commercially and industrially zoned land and the town's convenient location on Route 128, the high-tech beltway around Boston. In the last two years, about 1.5 million square feet of commercial projects have gone up, according to the Planning Director, Terry S. Szold. But since 1987 the town has imposed stricter controls to limit the density of some projects and has introduced greater local scrutiny in planning.
Financing for land acquisition and infrastructure work was provided through Kennedy Associates Real Estate Advisers of Seattle.
The Bank of New England provided the $21 million construction loan for the first building and permanent financing will come from the Multi-Employer Property Trust, a pool of union pension funds advised by Kennedy Associates, Mr. Galvin said.

N.B.A. Has Money to Burn in Lean Time

BYLINE: By SAM GOLDAPER

 BODY:
IN 1968, Dick Bloch paid $2 million to put a National Basketball Association franchise in Phoenix. In 1987, Bloch sold the Suns to a group headed by Jerry Colangelo, the team's general manager, for $44.5 million. Three weeks later, Colangelo said recently, he was offered $60 million for the team.
"Last December," Colangelo said, "one of the Big Eight accounting firms appraised the team's worth at $98.9 million." 
Such is the state of the economy in the N.B.A. While governments at all levels and corporations of all sizes struggle with deepening deficits, the N.B.A. has offer sheets to burn. Owners, players and even Commissioner David Stern (in the form of a multimillion-dollar contract) are reaping the benefits.
The Suns are not alone in benefiting from the skyrocketing values of N.B.A. franchises. In 1988, Paul Allen, a leader in the personal-computer industry, purchased the Portland Trail Blazers for $70 million. Last year, the Denver Nuggets were sold for $60 million.
By comparision, the Boston Celtics were sold for $19 million in 1983, before the N.B.A. began enjoying its current popularity and financial health. Three years later, the owners went public by offering 40 percent of the team in a limited partnership, and that move brought in $45 million.
Last February, an appreciated group of owners rewarded Stern, who took over in 1984, with a five-year contract that includes an annual salary of $3.5 million plus a bonus package worth $10 million.
Here are some of the assets of what has become one of the world's hottest sports business:
*With the league's network and cable television contracts totaling $875 million in the next four years, its revenues are projected to grow from $500 million to $650 million this year.
*N.B.A. Properties generated $750 million in retail licensing sales last year.
*N.B.A. Entertainment has produced two of the three best-selling sports video tapes: Michael Jordan's "Come Fly With Me," and "Dazzling Dunks and Basketball Bloopers."
*Other than the Olympics, N.B.A. International has become the world's most widely distributed sports property, selling and distributing league television rights to more than 75 countries.
*With some three dozen players earning $2 million or more this season, the average player's salary has skyrocketed from $750,000 last season to more than $900,000.
Indeed, nowhere has the league's wealth become so evident than in the huge salaries being given -- even thrown at -- players of all abilities. John Williams, likely to be the Cleveland Cavaliers' backup power forward, will earn $5 million as part of a $26.5 million package. Patrick Ewing, the Knicks' center, will be paid $3,750,000, the league's biggest salary this season. Not only are big stars earning huge salaries, but marginal players like Atlanta's Jon Koncak have become millionaires as well.
Despite the lack of a player capable of turning around a franchise, last June's first-round draft choices have contracts 38 percent richer than those of the 1989 first-round picks.
Pervis Ellison, the first pick over all in 1989, signed a five-year contract worth $11.5 million with the Sacramento Kings. Derrick Coleman, the first player chosen in 1990, asked the Nets for a 5-year, $16 million contract, then settled for $15 million.
"The league has never been healthier," said Colangelo, whose first N.B.A. job was doubling as chief scout and director of marketing for the 1966 expansion Chicago Bulls. He recalled that back then that team's total payroll was $180,000, and ticket prices were scaled at $2, $3, $4 and $5.
In the 1989-90 season, led by the Minnesota Timberwolves, an expansion franchise that drew 1,072,572 fans, the league enjoyed its seventh consecutive season of growth in attendance, drawing more than 17 million fans to its 1,107 games. The average attendance was 15,690 people.
To appreciate the success the N.B.A. now enjoys, one must understand the trying moments the league had to overcome.
Spurred by the Knicks winning N.B.A. titles in 1970 and 1973, Madison Avenue hypes tagged pro basketball as the Sport of the Seventies.
"They were a decade too early,"' said Paul Silas, a Knicks assistant coach who was president of the National Basketball Association Players Association from 1974 to 1980.
Before a 1976 merger with the American Basketball Association, the salary battles for top players sent salaries zooming to outlandish heights and many teams drowning in red ink.
By 1982, when the All-Star Game was played at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, the N.B.A. owners were greatly concerned. Neither the Denver Nuggets nor the Utah Jazz appeared capable of supporting themselves. The Indiana Pacers were up for sale but there were no takers. As many as five franchises, including the Clippers, then based in San Diego, and the Kings, in Kansas City, Mo., were in trouble.
A committee of owners was appointed to study cutting the league from 23 to 19 teams by merging the problem franchises.
While the owners wrestled with finances and the Players Association were equally concerned over the possible loss of 48 jobs, a more sinister problem emerged: drugs.
Stern, then the league's executive vice president, remembers those troubled times well.
"Those were the dark days," Stern said in a recent interview at his office high above Fifth Avenue. "There were underlying reasons why the N.B.A. got to where it was. When you're fighting off the possibility of a strike, drugs, high salaries and bad ownerships, they pushed their way onto newspaper pages. Once we solved those problems, we pushed the game back to the forefront where it belonged."
Charles Grantham, then the executive vice president of the Players Association and now its executive director, also remembers the bleak time.
"A story in The Los Angeles Times charging that 80 percent of our players were using drugs gave the public the perception that the N.B.A. was too black, drug-crazed and its players overpaid," Grantham said. "The image hurt. Game attendance dropped; television ratings and revenues fell. Things got so bad in the early 1980's that the championship playoffs were aired on tape delay, after the 11 o'clock news."
With Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan doing their bit on the court, coupled with the amicable collective-bargaining relationships that developed between Stern and Larry Fleisher, the general counsel of the Players Association, two landmark agreements were forged six months apart in 1983. Those pacts, more than anything else, set the stage for the N.B.A.'s dramatic turnaround.
On March 31, 1983, the N.B.A. and its players' union reached an agreement that guaranteed the players 53 percent of the gross revenues in exchange for a salary cap.
"The salary cap has provided the league with stability," Stern said. "Nobody who has been successful in business wants to buy a team that can't make money and can't win. With the cap, old and prospective new owners had a chance to project their costs."
Six months later, the two sides forged a wide-ranging drug program that called for lifetime suspension, with review after two years for players caught using drugs. It was the strongest stance taken against drug use by any professional sports league.
With the fans concentrating on the game again, Stern turned his attention to selling it. Corporate sponsors are eager to link their names with the world's fastest-growing sport.
Although Stern is concerned about the impact of the current economic climate in this country, he thinks the N.B.A. is in a strong position, even should a recession happen.
"I think our industry would be somewhat impaired, but probably much less than others," he said. "There would be a softening of advertising and sponsorship markets, but attendance would not be adversely affected in the short run. Regardless, we expect our growth to continue."
That growth could come from conquering new fields abroad. Phoenix and the Utah Jazz will play their first two regular season games Friday and Saturday in Japan and Stern won't be happy until everyone in Tokyo is wearing something with an N.B.A. logo.

THE AGE OF DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS
U.S. Economic Policy
in the 1990s.
By Paul Krugman.
204 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
The MIT Press.
$17.95. 
IN the introduction to this slim volume, Paul Krugman, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, divides economics prose into three categories: "Greek letter, up-and-down, and airport." The first, "formal, theoretical, mathematical," is for dedicated members of the cult only. The second, up-and-down economics (as in pork bellies are up, sterling is down), "has a reputation for being stupefyingly boring, a reputation that is almost entirely justified." The third, the gloom-or-boom prose endemic to the sort of economics books found next to the latest Tom Clancy on airport newsstands, "is usually fun, rarely well-informed and never serious."
As one might guess, Mr. Krugman's writing in "The Age of Diminished Expectations" fits none of the above. He is the rare professional economist who knows how to explain the essence of policy issues to a nonprofessional audience, and he manages it without a hint of condescension. "The Age of Diminished Expectations" is a remarkable achievement; a painless quick read that tells you much of what there is to know about the great economic issues of the day.
Mr. Krugman's central thesis is as simple as it is depressing: The American economy isn't doing very well, and no one is likely to fix what ails it any time soon. This country's biggest economic problem, and, arguably, the economy's only fundamental problem, is slow growth in productivity. Unless output per person grows, personal income can't grow very much. And without rising incomes, there will be no way for individuals to make better lives for themselves and no room in their hearts to make life better for others.
But productivity is not an issue that Washington cozies up to, Mr. Krugman notes, and for good reason. No one has a sure-fire way to get out of the productivity slump because no one knows how we got into it. The few things that just might make a big difference, such as a larger investment in intellectual and physical capital, would require sacrifice. And no politician worthy of his media consultant is ready to ask Americans to suffer in the name of an abstraction.
Mr. Krugman may be too pessimistic. It is certainly true that no President has lost points in recent decades by underestimating Americans' willingness to delay gratification. But it is also true that the one President who tried to sell sacrifice, Jimmy Carter, made it sound like an end in itself. The real problem may be that American politics no longer attracts serious characters with serious ideas. If and when we do get a leader with the vision thing, the public might well get the picture.
But you don't have to buy into Mr. Krugman's pessimism to recognize the value of his book. Each chapter is a bite-sized brief on a big issue, artfully compressing a remarkable amount of sophisticated economics. And in some cases, his analysis may even surprise those people who stay on top of the economic news.
Mr. Krugman argues, for example, that the real cost to American banks of writing off third world debts would be a tiny fraction of the $400 billion the deadbeats actually owe. Forgiving, say, half of the debt might actually prove costless because partial relief would sharply increase the value of the debt that remained.
He also offers an unusual take on the debate over whether the wave of corporate restructuring of the 1980's made American enterprise more efficient or simply transferred income from workers to investment bankers bearing spread sheets. Mr. Krugman thinks both forces were at work. Restructuring was immensely costly to the heavily unionized blue-collar elite, but it also allowed Rust Belt industries to adjust rapidly and efficiently to increased international competition.
The only time Mr. Krugman seems to stumble is when he takes on the question of what Japan's looming economic presence means for Americans. He serves up all the right arguments, but can't quite bring himself to the logical conclusion: Japan's failure to play by the rules has had little impact on America's economic prospects.
But this is a minor blemish. It is hard to think of another work of popular economics that asks so little of readers, yet delivers so much.

Dipping Into the Deficit: Should We Make a Federal Case of It?

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle; Louis Uchitelle reports on economics for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE year was 1938. The Great Depression had taken a turn for the worse, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, through the previous five years, had tried repeatedly to balance the Federal budget, finally gave up the effort. Among other steps, he reversed a cost-cutting order to disband the Public Works Administration. Instead, he pumped $1 billion into the agency -- all borrowed funds -- to pay the salaries of thousands of newly hired workers.
 The story is recounted in "Balanced Budgets and American Politics" by James D. Savage, a political scientist and the author of one of half a dozen books published in the last several years that analyze the present national aversion to deficits. Rarely in American history has the outcry against deficits been as strong as it is today, especially during this fall's messy battle in Washington over deficit reduction. In response, most of the authors of this sampling of books try to calm the citizenry. 
 They succeed, chiefly by offering their readers insights and history that don't often show up in daily news coverage. Roosevelt's experience is part of Mr. Savage's argument. Although the 32d President could never bring himself to acknowledge that deficit spending in peacetime was good policy, he accepted the practice in 1938 "as a positive and necessary activity if the economy were to recover," Mr. Savage writes. The strategy worked; the economy expanded in 1939 and kept right on growing. And for the next 40 years deficit spending became a proven and legitimate tool for regulating the economy. Not until the final year of Jimmy Carter's Presidency did the White House abandon, as standard policy, the sort of stimulation of the economy through Government programs proposed by the British economist John Maynard Keynes and first adopted in this country by F. D. R.
What would move Mr. Carter to abandon one of the New Deal's hallmark economic policies? Inflation frightened him into budget cutting. As big deficits developed, Mr. Carter and others came to blame them for inflation and other problems -- arguing cause and effect relationships that do not hold up well when deficits are examined more closely, as they have been in a number of recent books. That is certainly the case when deficits are placed in a historical context, as Mr. Savage does particularly well, and also Herbert Stein, in his "Governing the $5 Trillion Economy." While Mr. Savage traces various Government budgets back to 1690, Mr. Stein, a leader among the nation's conservative economists and one of his profession's most lucid and succinct writers, covers the pertinent history in a few pages.
The principal insight to be gathered from these accounts, and many others, is that a deficit should not be a nation's greatest concern; economic growth should be. Mr. Savage gives a five-page table of Government finances going back to 1789. It shows that deficits have been standard operating practice for two generations and the Federal Government has reported surpluses in only seven years since 1930.
Deficits simply were not considered a problem as long as the economy generated more than enough new wealth to pay for the shortfalls. The deficit might rise by, say, $10 billion from one year to the next. But if national income went up by $15 billion, then Americans could finance the shortfall -- through tax payments or the purchase of Treasury securities -- and still have $5 billion in new wealth left over for other purposes.
Until early in this century, the White House and Congress did not even think in terms of not having enough funds to pay for Government outlays. Only in 1911 did formal budgeting, as a means of allocating scarce resources, get under way, Mr. Stein notes. "The situation prior to that is something of a mystery," he writes. "The usual description is that, except in wartime, the Federal Government did not live with scarcity." In fact, from the end of the Civil War until the beginning of the 20th century budget surpluses were normal. As the nation spread rapidly westward in that period, the rising output of expanding agriculture, industry and railroads furnished more than enough wealth to pay for whatever services the Federal Government chose to offer.
Except during the two world wars and the Great Depression, Government spending did not outstrip the capacity of the nation's economic expansion to provide revenues until the early 1970's. The rebirth of other industrial nations and stiff competition from foreign corporations then cut into the American market and into the American share of the global market. And in the 70's and 80's Social Security, Medicare, military outlays, farm subsidies, highway and airport construction, welfare, education and many other Federal outlays that had blossomed after World War II became a burden.
What the recent books on the deficit reflect is that at that point the deficit became a political issue. Given an economy that no longer expands at its old, rapid rate, today's budget deficits represent a bigger percentage of the national wealth than they have at any time in the 20th century, except for the war and Depression years. That scared Americans into accepting the imposition a few years ago of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, which imposes a general sequestering of a percentage of the budget if Congress and the President cannot agree on certain levels of cuts in the deficit. And the fear of deficits explains why the recent struggle between President Bush and Congress, and among members of Congress, was so painful and disorderly as the two branches of Government tried to cut back services that are deeply entrenched in American society.
As the political scientists Joseph White and Aaron Wildavsky, authors of "The Deficit and the Public Interest," put it: "The budget has been to our era what civil rights, communism, the depression, industrialization and slavery were at other times. Nor does the day of the budget show signs of ending." Mr. White and Mr. Wildavsky devote most of their 575-page text to an account of the annual budget negotiations since 1974 -- a history that helps to explain why the push for cutbacks has finally become such a crisis issue. Making the choice to reduce the deficit is more difficult than anyone seems to admit, the authors declare.
BUT while budget deficits might be mostly a political issue, the daily debate highlights economics. Here the new budget literature is particularly useful in sorting fact from fiction. Nearly all the nation's economic ills are blamed these days on the deficit. It is linked to inflation, high interest rates, wasteful spending, lackluster investment, low productivity, the trade deficit and what is often presented as a fatal overdependence on foreign lenders.
F. D. R. had also associated deficits with inflation, although deflation was the big problem in the 30's. Fear of inflation, in fact, had made him reluctant before 1938 to use deficits to regulate the economy. As the reader will find out from these books, the essence of the view that deficits cause inflation and other dire economic consequences is this: to finance the big deficits the Government has to borrow so much money through the sale of Treasury securities that not enough is left over to invest in expansion of the private sector. Inflation inevitably erupts because without strong new investment the economy can't grow fast enough to supply all that people demand, particularly the demands of a big-spending Government. And with investment funds scarce, interest rates rise to ration loans. The high rates, in turn, discourage many companies from investing in factories, offices and machinery, further inhibiting the creation of new wealth. Foreign lenders, attracted by the high interest rates, then step in, becoming big lenders to the Government. Paying the interest in the future on the debt held by foreigners means a further drain on the national wealth.
In "Day of Reckoning," Benjamin M. Friedman, a Harvard University economist, lays out emphatically these doomsday economics of deficit spending. The other economists represented in this group of books mostly seem to disagree. They note, for example, that inflation and interest rates have been both high and low during years of big deficits, and so has investment. The deficit-doomsday links are hard to find in the record, they maintain.
Robert Ortner, in "Voodoo Deficits," is particularly sarcastic about the alleged dire economic consequences of deficits. Mr. Ortner was the chief economist at the Commerce Department during the Reagan Administration, which made deficit cutting a major goal -- even though it took no substantive action to reduce the deficit. Among other arguments, Mr. Ortner notes that the annual deficit would be much lower if it weren't for the nearly $200 billion a year the Government spends on interest payments to service the $3 trillion accumulated national debt. Such big interest payments mean that less is available for Social Security, the military and other programs. But, Mr. Ortner argues, nearly 85 percent of the national debt is held by Americans, so the interest payments go mostly to them rather than to foreigners. They stay within the national family, so to speak, ameliorating the shortage of funds in the private sector.
The accumulation of such arguments in most of the new deficit literature helps to explain why the deficits, big as they are, haven't yet produced much noticeable economic damage. Even Mr. Friedman, committed as he is to cutting the deficit, suggests that the American economy can still find ways to finance it, although it is approaching $300 billion in the current fiscal year, roughly 5 percent of the total economy, as measured by the gross national product. Only in the late 1940's, in the aftermath of World War II, and during the recession of the early '80's, has the percentage been that high.
THE issue, then, is how to reverse the trend and make the deficit shrink as a percentage of the total economy, or least to prevent its rise. Most of these authors devote a chapter to their favorite proposals, and the last chapter of Mr. Friedman's book is eloquent. Among other ideas, he would as a last resort reverse Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts, which reduced Federal revenue by hundreds of billions of dollars in the 1980's. If other measures prove politically unacceptable, he writes, "Then the best way to right our fiscal policy -- the way most likely to promote public understanding and thereby command public support -- is to admit that with Kemp-Roth [the name of the Reagan tax bill] we cut taxes too much, and fix our mistake."
But raising taxes to reduce the deficit just as the American economy is sinking toward recession runs counter to the old Keynesian thesis that in hard times Government should be encouraging people to spend and invest, not restricting spending through higher taxes or cutbacks in outlays. Keynesian stimulus might be gone from the Administration's box of policy tools, but the principle involved remains very much in people's minds. Most politicians and economists are reluctant to cut Government spending in a weakening economy.
Robert Eisner's "How Real Is the Federal Deficit?," first published in 1986 and now the granddaddy of the deficit books, stands today as a sort of classic reference work for those who want to restore the Keynesian approach to politics. Mr. Eisner, an economist at Northwestern University, argues that to a large extent, the deficits represent productive investments that increase the national wealth. For him, spending for highways, education, research, airports, even health care, increases the nation's productive capacity, just as the output from a new factory increases a corporation's revenues and profits. A well-educated worker, for instance, can produce more goods of better quality than a poorly educated one, and a wide new highway gets goods to market faster and less expensively than an older, rutted one.
And just as the corporation uses the earnings from its new factory to repay the bonds floated to build it, the Government draws on the new wealth that flows from the nation's productive investments to finance the deficit. Separate the Government's "capital expenditures" from its outlays for consumption (including most military spending), and the startling deficits of the 80's shrink toward insignificance, Mr. Eisner argues.
Mr. Eisner makes his case in somewhat technical language, while the economists Robert L. Heilbroner and Peter Bernstein, in "The Debt and the Deficit," covering the same ground, assume that their reader comes new to the deficit issue and they make it easier to grasp. The liberal Mr. Heilbroner and the conservative Mr. Stein, however much they differ in ideology, seem to agree that deficits are not the greatest dangers to society. The two men are probably the profession's easiest-to-read and most entertaining writers and their deficit books, each less than 140 pages, cover the ground well enough for most readers. What does the Heilbroner-Bernstein book conclude? "In normal times we favor a 'deficit', by which we mean growth-promoting expenditures . . . of 2 to 3 percent of G.N.P. -- perhaps $100 billion to $150 billion at today's values," they write. "And that is all. The lesson is over."

THE GREATEST-EVER BANK ROBBERY
The Collapse of the Savings and Loan Industry.
By Martin Mayer.
354 pp. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. $22.50. 
 FOR the past several weeks, Representative Bill Schuette, the Republican Senate candidate in Michigan, has been accusing Democratic Senator Carl Levin of accepting campaign contributions from a law firm that worked for Charles H. Keating Jr., the former savings and loan executive who has become a symbol of the nation's worst financial scandal. When the two candidates debated in early September, Senator Levin fired back, saying that Mr. Schuette had accepted funds from a major accounting firm that had been implicated in another savings and loan failure. The next day Mr. Schuette escalated again, accusing Senator Levin of accepting funds from six accounting firms that are "being sued by the Federal Government in connection with the S.& L. scandal."
Such is the extent to which the bottomless savings and loan disaster has diminished the reputations of many of our leading professions. To the veteran financial journalist Martin Mayer, that story, the failure of accountants, lawyers, Wall Street brokers, politicians and most regulators to rein in fast-dealing S.& L. executives, is the real scandal in the industry's spectacular collapse. "What makes the S& L outrage so important a piece of American history is not the hundreds of billions of dollars [lost] but the demonstration of how low our standards for professional performance have fallen in law, accounting, appraising, banking, and politics -- all of them," he writes in his awkwardly titled book, "The Greatest-Ever Bank Robbery."
That tone of sustained moral outrage at the professions that acquiesced in, and often encouraged, the looting is Mr. Mayer's real contribution to the swelling shelf of books on the savings and loan disaster. Over all, this is only a workmanlike effort that adds little to the existing literature. He revisits the familiar story of the savings and loans' descent into financial hell. Squeezed by inflation in the late 1970's, the industry -- which had traditionally anchored itself in the unglamorous business of accepting savings from small depositors and writing home mortgages -- won from Congress and the Reagan Administration the authority to bid aggressively for larger deposits and to invest the money in speculative ventures. With that new freedom, an astounding variety of schemers and dreamers pilfered, lost and gambled away immense sums, leaving the Federal Government with a tab that may exceed $500 billion by the year 2020.
Other books -- including "The Big Fix" by James Ring Adams and the best-selling "Inside Job" by three financial journalists -- Stephen Pizzo, Mary Fricker and Paul Muolo -- have already recounted the sheer picaresque lunacy of this conflagration with far more enthusiasm than Mr. Mayer. Mr. Mayer does his usual thorough reporting job, but he has little flair for storytelling or characters; his politicians are all cardboard figures, his regulators and industry executives distant and vague.
His preferred milieu is the intricacies of Federal law and banking regulation. Mr. Mayer knows his way around this arcane territory, but his focus on it leaves the book with the dry feel of a legal brief -- and a somewhat disorganized one at that. The book has an unfortunate tendency to begin stories and then drift away to other subjects. If there is an organizational scheme here, it is as complicated as any of the bizarre loan arrangements savings and loan executives used to evade their regulators.
For all its defects, the book has important virtues. Mr. Mayer's asides are often eye-opening: he chides newspapers for unquestioningly running advertisements soliciting deposits for S.& L.'s that were clearly on the verge of collapse. And Mr. Mayer performs a service by shining the spotlight of outrage not only on the crass and colorful hucksters who crashed previously sleepy thrifts, but the pin-striped pillars of prominent law offices and accounting firms who profitably cloaked the hucksters' schemes in respectability.
What Mr. Mayer illustrates is complete institutional myopia on all sides, the dispiriting inability of almost anyone who interacted with the thrift industry -- even those in public service -- to think for a moment about the implications of their actions for the public interest. The exceptions -- a few courageous savings and loan regulators in Texas, California and Washington who tried to slow down the rush to disaster -- found themselves harassed by some of the most powerful members of Congress, from Senator Alan Cranston, the majority whip, to former Speaker of the House Jim Wright, who relied on the industry for substantial campaign contributions.
Mr. Mayer has waded through this financial swamp searching for the correct moral. "We are farther along than anyone thought on our road to a Hobbesian society: These days you can't trust anybody," he writes. "Americans really don't want to live this way. But they have forgotten that there are other ways." That is a sobering lesson from a dizzying calamity.

THE NEW RIGHT AND THE CONSTITUTION
Turning Back the Legal Clock.
By Bernard Schwartz.
310 pp. Boston:
Northeastern University Press. $32.50. 
 WHEN Judge Robert H. Bork was nominated for a seat on the Supreme Court three years ago, Senator Edward M. Kennedy warned that he would "turn back the clock" on civil rights and civil liberties if confirmed. Few phrases could have served as a more potent call to opposition. Liberal constitutionalists have viewed the Supreme Court in recent decades as the agent of ineluctable, enlightened progress, intervening to protect the outnumbered and the powerless from abuses of majority power. A vote for Judge Bork would be a vote to go back to the bad old days. Who wanted to "turn back the clock"? Not the Senate, which ultimately defeated the Bork nomination by a vote of 58-42.
Bernard Schwartz, a New York University law professor, is a strong subscriber to the liberal faith in constitutional progress. The subtitle of his new book, "The New Right and the Constitution: Turning Back the Legal Clock," echoes the refrain of the Bork defeat. His earlier books, "The Unpublished Opinions of the Warren Court" and "The Unpublished Opinions of the Burger Court," gained him unusual access to the Court's normally secret internal correspondence and memorandums. His new book surveys the work of a handful of "new right" judges and law professors who, in Mr. Schwartz's view, have wrought a dangerous influence on the law by seeking nothing less than "a repeal of the twentieth century."
What is the great constitutional accomplishment of the 20th century that Mr. Schwartz would preserve against this onslaught? The transformation of the Supreme Court from reinforcer of existing hierarchies to agent of social change. At the beginning of the century, as Mr. Schwartz tells it, the Supreme Court upheld Jim Crow and capitalism and struck down progressive labor legislation in the name of economic liberty, while leaving oppressed groups and personal liberty at the mercy of the state.
Three great constitutional moments, however, brought deliverance. At the height of the New Deal in the mid-1930's, the Supreme Court retreated from the field of economic regulation, leaving to elected officials the whole business of distributing wealth. As the civil rights movement gained momentum in the mid-1950's, the Supreme Court renounced the doctrine of separate but equal and declared an end to racial segregation in the schools. And as the 1960's brought on the sexual revolution, the Supreme Court acknowledged a right of privacy that would bar the state from regulating what goes on behind the bedroom door.
Along the way, constitutional priorities were reversed to value personal liberty over the protection of property. Government now may freely regulate economic transactions, but it may not act so readily when it comes to sex or speech. Liberty of contraception has replaced liberty of contract in the pantheon of fundamental rights.
Mr. Schwartz treats such developments as a kind of evolutionary necessity. The Court's abandonment of doctrines of "self-devouring individualism" permitted government to "control the excesses and relieve the oppressions of the rising industrial economy." With Brown v. Board of Education, the Court launched a process of desegregation that, as a practical matter, "could not realistically be left to elected representatives." By permitting the post-New Deal growth of independent agencies into a fourth branch not originally contemplated by the Framers, the Court made it possible for "modern government . . . to exercise the functions that public opinion has required it to assume."
In the face of such progress, Mr. Schwartz argues, the "new right" constitutionalists are radical reactionaries who would have us take a constitutional "quantum leap backward." To confine the Constitution to the Framers' original intent, for example, "could mean a return to an era characterized by Jim Crow, the rack and the pillory, and no paper money." To read the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause as narrowly limiting Government's power of eminent domain "would have all but rendered effective urban planning impossible in this country." To insist on a rigid separation of powers in the Federal Government would "strike at the very heart of the administrative state." Taken together, these arguments are "conservative only in a Pickwickian sense," as the "new right" in fact aims "to uproot established doctrine and replace it with principles long repudiated."
"The New Right and the Constitution" usefully gathers and explicates in a single volume a variety of "new right" constitutional arguments. Some have been well ventilated beneath the glare of lights in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room. But while the nation watched closely as Ronald Reagan and George Bush filled four Supreme Court seats, it paid little attention as they also appointed over half the sitting Federal judges in the lower Federal courts. Mr. Schwartz performs a useful service by reporting on what some of those lesser-known judges are up to.
HIS book, however, is less successful as a critique. Mr. Schwartz contemplates the implications of "new right" constitutional jurisprudence with an air of disbelief and mild shock, like the hero of a work of science fiction rubbing his eyes incredulously as he witnesses the unexpected resurrection of a hardy band of aliens he thought had been eliminated. His response is to reassure himself and his fellow earthlings that it can't happen here. Why not? Because there is too much settled law under the bridge. Having cast the "new right" as radicals, Mr. Schwartz slips too easily into the conservative role of defending the status quo.
But surely it is not enough to defend a practice simply because it exists, for that it exists does not mean that it is good. After all, one man's progress is another man's decline and fall. The challenge for those of us who defend the liberal constitutional order is to articulate why the right of privacy deserves stronger protection than the right of contract, why sex and speech should not be regulated like commerce, and why desegregation orders are not legislation from the bench. Mr. Schwartz's book leaves off where those tasks for liberal constitutional scholarship begin.
At the same time, Mr. Schwartz credits "new right" constitutional theorists with more influence than they have actually had: however extraterrestrial their origins, he seems to say, they have landed, spread and "altered the American jurisprudential landscape." This is an overstatement.
FOR one thing, "new right" legal scholars are not an army or even a political party. Reagan era Republicans may have been united on a party platform of decreasing economic regulation while increasing social control, but "new right" legal thinkers are hardly so monolithic. Some are libertarian on both the economic and the social fronts. The University of Chicago law professor Richard A. Epstein, for example, would revitalize property rights in part to protect privacy -- to exclude the moral judgments of others in the absence of material harm. Judge Frank H. Easterbrook of the Chicago-based Federal Court of Appeals, for another example, can hardly have endeared himself to the Reagan Administration by striking down an Indianapolis antipornography ordinance on classic First Amendment grounds. And Judge Easterbrook and his colleague Judge Richard A. Posner both recently voted to invalidate a work-place "fetal protection" policy as sex discrimination because it treated women as potential pregnancies rather than as individuals who know their own minds.
Moreover, Mr. Schwartz barely mentions that some of the targets of his book have proved flatly unappointable to the courts. He sounds chapter-long alarms against such academics as Bernard H. Siegan (for advocating a revival of economic rights) and Lino A. Graglia (for attacking school desegregation orders), letting on only in the fine print of the endnotes that the extremism of both men had kept them off the Federal bench. Likewise relegated to an afterthought is the Senate's defeat of the Bork nomination. Mr. Schwartz treats Judge Bork, like Mr. Siegan and Mr. Graglia, as one more player in a cast of influential right-wing jurists -- despite the monumental fact of his rejection by the Senate. Only late in the book does Mr. Schwartz concede, "It is true that President Reagan was not able to win confirmation for some of his most controversial judicial nominees."
The Bork defeat, however, was no minor rebuff. In rejecting Judge Bork in 1987, the Democratically controlled Senate drew a line in the sand. No one publicly committed to "turning back the clock" might cross. When the Senate recently confirmed President Bush's nominee, David H. Souter, for appointment to the Supreme Court, it furnished a cautionary epilogue to Mr. Schwartz's book. Justice Souter survived the Senate gantlet only by affirming at least some broad commitment to an evolving Constitution in which judges must expound unenumerated rights and fill "vacuums" in the enforcement of civil rights. Had he not done so, the outcome might well have been different. Justice Souter's confirmation suggests that moderates, not reactionaries, still hold the key cards.
Does "The New Right and the Constitution" thus cry wolf? The answer is no. While the book overstates the influence of conservative constitutional jurisprudence on actual legal outcomes, it correctly notes that the "new right" has shifted the dialogue. The key players in Mr. Schwartz's book may be alone out near the right-field fence, but when they position themselves so far over, they pull the rest of the players on the field to the right along with them.
WHAT are some examples of this directional shift? The right of privacy is here to stay, and even the controversial Roe v. Wade decision is unlikely to be flatly overturned. But the more the right challenges the legitimacy of that decision, the more likely the center is to tolerate some increased state regulation of abortion. The same holds for the exclusionary rule, which requires that illegally obtained evidence be excluded from criminal trials: Mapp v. Ohio, which announced the rule, won't be flatly overruled, but the more the right employs cost-benefit analysis to attack its reasoning, the more exceptions to the rule the center may agree to carve out. And while the repeal of the entire welfare state as a "taking" of private property is hardly imminent, courts have dealt property owners some more limited victories against government power.
If Mr. Schwartz thus began his book with sirens blaring, he ends on a quieter note. In the final pages, he appears to concede that his hardy band of aliens has had more effect in unsettling the mind than in changing the law -- a bit like a listener to Orson Welles's radio version of "War of the Worlds" might have felt when he found out it was not a real news bulletin after all.

GRATITUDE
Reflections on What We Owe
to Our Country.
By William F. Buckley Jr.
169 pp. New York:
Random House. $16.95. 
 WHAT a year! Mikhail Gorbachev embraces the free market and wins the Nobel Peace Prize. F. W. de Klerk attacks apartheid. Pat Buchanan criticizes the deployment of United States forces to the Persian Gulf. Jesse Jackson supports that deployment. And now William F. Buckley Jr., the distinguished dean of the intellectual right, in a long essay that he acknowledges will disturb his fellow conservatives, favors national service legislation summoning young Americans to 12 months of low-paid, low-grade public employment.
Growing support for national service, spearheaded by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, has heretofore been confined largely to Democrats. The national Democratic Party platform of 1988 urged a program providing "opportunities for voluntary national public service, above and beyond current services, that can enrich our communities." In "Gratitude" Mr. Buckley asserts that he is opposed to the Nunn version, but his stated objections do not dispute its basic thrust. A Republican counterpart he dismisses out of hand as "a halfhearted substitute bill, not worth exploring."
To retain his conservative credentials with Milton Friedman, Martin Anderson and other true believers who have attacked the concept of national service as subversive of our freedom, Mr. Buckley sprinkles his commentary with his usual swipes at liberals, egalitarianism, bleeding-heart politics, the bureaucratic class, organized welfare, the war on poverty, the minimum wage, the abolition of literacy tests for voting, The New Republic, Harry Truman and former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall (whom Mr. Buckley confuses with Stew's brother, Representative Morris Udall). It is good conservative doctrine, he insists, to recognize the citizen's ties to the community beyond those that relate to the state or the marketplace.
But Messrs. Friedman, Anderson, et al. are unlikely to be reassured. They know the telltale signs of conservative backsliding when they see them -- defensive statements like "the market shouldn't be asked to perform functions for which it is incompetent" and small heresies such as his view that the country no longer has "the need for a very large military" (both of which sound more like the former Democratic Congressman Charlie Buckley than Bill).
John F. Kennedy summoning young Americans to the New Frontier was rarely more eloquent than Mr. Buckley articulating every citizen's obligation to ask what he can do for his country as requital for liberties inherited and protected. In part, Mr. Buckley supports national service, as President Kennedy did the Peace Corps, out of a conviction that the increased awareness of those who subscribe will be of even greater value to our country than the services they provide.
Essentially, Mr. Buckley favors -- with ample allowance for variations and experimentation -- a national service program enrolling most of the nation's young men and women after high school graduation to perform roughly 12 months of social, civic and philanthropic labor. To prove that he is still the sworn enemy of Federal bureaucracy and coercion, he wants the 50 states to approve the program, pay the volunteers and decide on their activities. He envisions a new Federal agency, financed with Federal funds, setting standards, coordinating efforts and enforcing sanctions.
Sanctions? For a program of youthful volunteers eager to show their devotion to country?
HIS principal emphasis is on gratitude -- thus the title of the book -- on one's debt and duty to country and community, on uniting the privilege of citizenship in a republic with responsibility: "Materialistic democracy beckons every man to make himself a king; republican citizenship incites every man to be a knight." Service to one's society summons forth "the better angels within our nature." Beautiful, especially coming from one who has done his bit over the years to disparage those public servants or would-be public servants with whom he disagrees.
Gratitude, not intimidation. Subscription, not conscription. The state should not be entitled to exact work from unwilling citizens, writes Mr. Buckley. But just to make sure pride of patrimony is awakened in a sufficiently large number of young hearts, to encourage this particular form of expressing gratitude, to penalize any civic sluggard who is unwilling to show his devotion in this fashion, Mr. Buckley favors the extensive use of what he gently terms "inducements" to see to it that national service is "heavily subscribed."
Voluntary? Of course, it's voluntary, young sir or madam. Feel free, upon graduating from high school and turning 18, to renounce any notion of national service -- provided you are also willing to forgo your high school diploma, driver's license, student loan, right to equal treatment under the law and status as a first-class citizen. When Bill Buckley wants you to express gratitude, he doesn't fool around.
Perhaps I misread Mr. Buckley, not being a lexicographer. If I understand him -- and frequently I do not -- national service, morphologically speaking, is apodictically not a mere millenarian velleity or synecdoche exiguously reified as antinomian meliorism by exogenous Ortega y Gasset epigones with their conflated burins. At least, I certainly hope not! But be prepared for these and similar terms when you tackle Mr. Buckley's text.
As always, it is a learned text, citing seven Presidents, six philosophers, five scholars, four economists, three novelists, two popes and one poet -- and there may be a partridge in a pear tree in there as well. One source from whom he quotes at length is none other than William F. Buckley Jr. himself. In sentences running up to 70 words in length, erudite arguments are mixed, not always successfully, with fictitious examples, autobiographical experiences and a dubious analogy to the Swiss national service program.
I HAVE occasional difficulty with Mr. Buckley's sesquipedalian style of writing. I have some mild disagreements with his approach to national service legislation. I doubt that he will succeed in convincing his fellow conservatives that his approach shuns any hint of Federal regimentation. But I have no difficulty understanding and embracing Mr. Buckley's underlying message. He is clearly devoted to this country, deeply grateful for the liberties and privileges it has afforded us and genuinely committed to recognizing and repaying that debt. After an American decade marred by greed and self-indulgence, this book, in reminding us all of our obligations, is a national service.
 
 
 
A CALL TO WORK
 The objective should be to enroll, by the turn of the century, more than 80 percent of Americans born in 1973 or later. . . . Yes, there needs to be a National Service Franchise Administration. Its primary function should be to gather information for use by the states and indeed by individuals seeking (for instance) a locality that sustains an NSFA program most congenial to their inclination. . . . But the NSFA, observing its mandate, should also recommend appropriate legislation to Congress, legislation having primarily to do with federal sanctions. No federal money would be used to finance national service; federal money would be made available only to absorb administrative costs run up by the [NSFA]. . . . A vital function of the Administration would be to establish how long a participant would need to work in order to qualify for his certificate of service. The states decide what are the accrediting activities and which should be given precedence. But only a single agency can reasonably decide what the total contribution, measured in time served, ought to be. The idea of one year's service appeals. -- From "Gratitude."

HEADLINE: On Language;
Moving the Goalposts

BYLINE: BY WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
"These conditions are clear-cut and are not open to reinterpretation," said President Bush, explaining his criteria for opening trade with South Africa, "and I do not believe in moving the goalposts."
There's a term that has been popping up of late. "The Japanese . . . can no longer rely on localization as a means of satisfying Europe's requirements," complained a Japanese lobbyist in London. "This is a classic case of moving the goalposts." 
 A few years ago, following the Reykjavik summit meeting, a British diplomat at the United Nations objected to the way "the Russians have withdrawn from that understanding. . . . They have moved the goal posts."
The first use I can find is in 1978, when Albert V. Casey of American Airlines used the phrase while keeping a stiff upper lip about deregulation. The Washington Post, in quoting him, used a revealing verb: " 'They keep moving the goal posts,' he lamented."
You lament, complain, gripe and whine about moving the goalposts (which I write as one word, contrary to Times style, to settle the issue). That is because the phrase refers to an example of unfairness, a useful shortening of "changing the rules in the middle of the game."
"This term is British," says Peter Stothard, United States editor of The Times of London, "and means 'changing the terms of a debate or a conflict after it's been started.' I expect it's more from children's playing, where the sticks marking the goal can be moved, than from organized football. It's a very common term now, both in politics and in social conversation. A child, for instance, who's been told to keep his room clean for an extra 50 pence a week, and then doesn't get the extra money, may say, 'Hey, you've moved the goalposts.' "
The term is always accusatory; nobody boasts of moving the goalposts. But a right-wing commentator who was surprised by the scope of change in the Soviet Union, and then set new criteria for the success of perestroika, pre-emp tively struck at told-you-so criticism by asserting that he (O.K., I) had indeed moved the goalposts "to reflect the basic changes in the game."
 
Readout
 "IS A WRITTEN READOUT a handout?" asked my colleague David E. Rosenbaum of The New York Times.
At about that time, Richard E. Cohen of National Journal was being told by a staff member of the House Appropriations Committee that his question would be answered as soon as a readout could be prepared. Troubled by this locution, the reporter found a citation in writing and sent it to me: a transcript of a White House press briefing that began, "Welcome to the prebrief -- or readout, excuse me -- on the visit of President Ben Ali of Tunisia."
A quick phone call to the horse's mouth (which is an expression of authenticity, not a derogation of President Bush or his spokesman) for an explanation of current usage:
"Readout is a colloquial conjunction of two separate expressions," says Marlin Fitzwater, the Presidential press secretary, obviously consulting notes in his hand. "The first is 'to read your notes,' which is what we do in reporting to the press about a meeting we attended. The second part, the out part, may be from 'to speak out,' as in telling the press about what happened."
Date of coinage? "I've heard it since I got here in 1983," recalls Mr. Fitzwater, which pushes its time of origin back to the early Reagan or late Carter Administration. The meaning? "A readout is a report on what happened at a meeting."
The derivation is computerese. The first sense in the Oxford English Dictionary, which prefers the hyphenated form, is "the extraction or transfer of data from a storage medium or device."
For a more hands-on definition, let us turn to Pete Cottrell of the University of Maryland's computer science department: "Readout refers to instrument panels or video displays. It's human interface with the machine conveying information, as opposed to printout, which is the output of the machine that you can carry away in your hand."
Thus, an answer to Mr. Rosenbaum: in journalese, a readout is not a handout; it is a public recitation of information from which notes may be taken or, if permission is given, pictures may be transmitted.
 
Supa Japanese
 THE LANGUAGES OF EAST Asia seem disoriented these days. Bouncing about what is no longer called the Far East, where I found China Airlines (two words) more reliable than Japan Air Lines (three words), the traveler is jarred by the adoption of American terms: teribi is Japanese for "terrible," and supa, for "super," is superseding the ancient Japanese borrowing, "O.K."; the pronunciation of supa mimics the American "soop-a." This signifies a rough balance of trade in words: we have adopted honcho, their word for "squad leader," as a verb meaning "to be straw boss over."
All around the world, however, language follows life. As work habits change and living styles shift, we form new words to describe people in new roles.
In the United States, a word was needed for a man who does the housework and looks after the kids while his wife pursues a career outside the home; the coinage was househusband, based on housewife, which was formed in parallel over the past eight centuries with the German Hausfrau.
Many housewives now prefer the sexless homemaker; few househusbands adopt that term, preferring -- cheerfully or defiantly -- the specifically male identification. In time, as the need to assert sexual identification declines, that term may be replaced by domestic economist despite objections from learned practitioners of the dismal science.
Househusband is an analogue, coined by analogy; the Japanese usually prefer to coin a new life-style word by applying a new sense to a word already familiar in another area.
Example: what do you call a man who retires and pokes around the house, getting in the way? In the United States, he's called a retiree, and in Britain, a pensioner -- both neutral terms, with the adjective aimless or prepositional phrase at loose ends tacked on fore or aft to modify them pejoratively. (If anyone has a good term for "active, involved retiree, creatively contemplative, and a real pleasure to have around the house," as most of my retired readers surely are, send it in.)
In Japan, the word for a bored retiree, as viewed by his soured spouse, is nureha.
"Nureha are wet, fallen leaves," writes C. Alton Robertson in The Japan Times. "And anyone who has tried to sweep wet, fallen leaves off their steps or street (as any Japanese housewife has) knows how impossible it is. They are well and truly stuck.
 "Nureha is now used to mean a retired man who sticks to his wife like a wet, fallen leaf. . . . He watches her cook; he watches her do the laundry; he goes shopping with her. Nureha."
A cruel term, but life is unfair, and language follows life. They keep moving the goalposts.

HEADLINE: Corporations Struggle to Sell Transferees' Houses

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, DEL.

 BODY:
It's tough enough to have one house to sell these days. But America's largest companies are ending up with hundreds, as the stagnant real-estate market swells their inventories of houses they buy from employees they are relocating.
E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, , which moves 4,000 employees a year, has watched its inventories double in Delaware and Pennsylvania in the last year, to 160 houses. To sell those houses without driving prices down further, Du Pont has adopted a program of incentives to lure home buyers, including low-interest mortgages and a chance to win prizes just by looking at a house. 
 Buyer incentives and other ways of coping with the soft real estate market were a major topic at the fall meeting of the Employee Relocation Council held last week in Los Angeles.
"Dealing with high inventories certainly is a concern," said Anita Brienza, communications director with the thousand-member relocation council.
Du Pont is not alone. Eastman Kodak Company has also seen its stockpile in of houses in the Rochester area double, and its national inventory increase by 10 to 20 percent. And at ICI Americas, the United States arm of the international chemical giant, the company, which is based here, is now carrying 58 houses, compared with half that number a year ago.
Still, the sluggish real estate market has not cut down on the number of corporate transfers, according to Ms. Brienza, who said that some companies move more than a thousand employees each year.
Transfers this year are at about last year's level, she said, although 1989's activity was down somewhat from a peak the year before.
"Companies view it as a cost of doing business," Ms. Brienza said. "It's worth it to them to get their first choice on the job. They're making an investment in employees."
The cost of relocation can be large, averaging $50,000 for each employee moved. Steven E. Rogers, supervisor of corporation relocation for Du Pont, which has its headquarters here, said that cost is "certainly" a concern.
"But Du Pont is in the business to make sure the right people are in the right jobs," he said.
The chemical company's program of buying houses from employees it was relocating began in the recession of 1974, when the market was also sluggish. Kodak began its program in the mid-60's. According to the Relocation Council, 84 percent of the council's members now either buy an employee's house during a transfer or assign it to a relocation company like Prudential Relocation Management of White Plains, N.Y., up from from 48 percent in 1974.
"We want to take that worry off the employees, because worry takes away from productivity," said Mr. Rogers. "You can't put a value on it, but we believe it makes a difference for the company and the employees."
Under most programs the company offers to buy a house for the average of two or three appraisals. Many programs allow the employee a certain period, generally 60 days, to sell the house independently or with a broker. Some companies discourage employees from trying to market the house themselves.
"We don't want them improperly marketing the property," said Thomas B. McLaughlin, assistant manager for finance and real estate for ICI Americas.
Corporate real estate managers say that in the current unstable market they are having difficulty getting employees to accept appraisals of their house as accurate. Similarly, the relocation council says that assessments are a key concern of employees today as well.
"They think the appraisals are low ball," said Warren Dungee, property manager for Du Pont.
For that reason, some companies tell employees that if they find a buyer at a better price themselves or through a broker, the company will step in and handle complications of the closing once a contract is signed.
Companies also offer loss protection plans that reimburse employees for capital improvements they have made to their properties. Under some programs, the company will pay 100 percent of the cost of major additions, and 50 percent of luxury improvements, like swimming pools.
Once a house becomes the property of a company, the carrying costs can be substantial -- 1 or 2 percent of its price a month, by the industry's rule of thumb. This includes interest charges, taxes, maintenance and repairs. Nearly all the companies make whatever repairs are needed to put the house in move-in condition.
While houses Du Pont owns in Louisiana, Oklahoma and other oil-patch states are beginning to move after a few rough years, the properties it and other companies are holding in the Northeast are becoming harder to sell.
"We're taking a major loss in Rochester," said Mee Wing, director of corporate relocation for Kodak. "The Northeast is bad."
For this reason, companies are starting to offer incentives to buyers. The Du Pont company recently announced a special program to sell its stockpile of homes in Delaware and Pennsylvania. The purpose of the incentive program, the company says, is to sell homes without bringing prices down throughout the community.
Buyers of a Du Pont home in Pennsylvania and Delaware will be eligible for below-market financing through a mortgage company with which Du Pont has made a special arrangement.
Anyone who even tours a Du Pont home is eligible for a drawing for a free trip to Cancun, Mexico, and real estate agents who show a corporate listing will have their names in a drawing for a $10,000 prize.
While some homeowners have complained that this use of the financial muscle of a Fortune 500 company leaves them at a disadvantage, real estate agents praise such programs as the only way to keep a community's price structure from tumbling.
In any case, the incentives are working: Du Pont has sold a house a day since the program was announced earlier this month.
"It's put people in the looking mode," said Daniel B. Henderson, director of corporate relocation with Gilpin, Van Trump & Montgomery Inc., a real estate agency in Wilmington.
Du Pont first tried the incentives program in Hobbs, N.M., where Conoco, the company's oil subsidiary, has an operation. Since it was begun in the early summer, 45 of the company's 65 homes in Hobbs have been sold, most within two months, said Anneta Cheney, associate broker with Newman & Company in Hobbs.
The Hobbs real estate market, which fluctuates with the oil-based local economy, has been depressed since 1982. Prices were "devastated" when many of the oil companies pulled out back then, Mrs. Cheney said.
Many of the companies simply told their employees to "slash prices," she said, with the result that values throughout the area went down.
Incentives are a much more community-minded approach, she said. "Activity breeds activity," said Mrs. Cheney. Home shoppers, Mrs. Cheney added, "might start out by looking at a corporate listing and end up buying a house with no special financing."

HEADLINE: On the Stump, Lundine Looks to '94

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine has been running hard. For the last four months, he has been scurrying about the state delivering six-a-day speeches in which he urges voters to return the Cuomo-Lundine team to Albany, to approve the environmental bond act, and to elect a Democratic majority to the State Senate.
But the true focus of Mr. Lundine's rigorous campaign is less the election this Nov. 6 than the one on Nov. 8, 1994. The Lieutenant Governor, who toils largely in anonymity, views this year's race as his last, best opportunity to become better known before the expected race to succeed Mr. Cuomo begins. 
 If Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Lundine are re-elected this year, and if Mr. Cuomo does not run for a fourth term, Mr. Lundine said that "it would be highly likely that I would run" for governor four years from now.
The 51-year-old Mr. Lundine has started that campaign early.
He has traveled the state more extensively than Mr. Cuomo and has concentrated much of his time in New York City, where most of the state's voters live and where the former Jamestown mayor is least known.
 
Raising Visibility
 "The first four years of being a competent insider were fine, but now I think I need to increase my visibility," said Mr. Lundine, whom Mr. Cuomo first selected as a running mate in 1986. "That's a difficult thing to do in a number-two job."
It also can be a difficult thing to do when you have Mr. Lundine's laid-back political persona and labored speaking style.
As politicians go, Mr. Lundine seems refreshingly earnest, self-effacing and devoid of conceit. He is also amiable and funny, especially when deriding his own profession. His imitation of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is a particular crowd-pleaser.
But he has never been, and may never become, a stirring public speaker or the kind of leader who can control a room with his presence.
Last Thursday, for example, while trying to battle both a breakneck schedule in New York City and a lingering chest cold, Mr. Lundine was oratorically upstaged at a rally for the environmental bond act on the Brooklyn Heights promenade by 14-year-old Paula Rodriguez. Miss Rodriguez spoke poignantly of the obligation of one generation to preserve the environment for the next. Mr. Lundine read from his typed index cards: "I think we all like to drink clean water and we wouldn't want that threatened."
 
Speech Lessons
 Still, there have been signs of progress for the candidate, who takes occasional lessons from a speech coach. At a Nassau County Democratic dinner, Mr. Lundine scored with several ad libs and rhetorical uppercuts aimed at the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Pierre A. Rinfret.
"They nominated him for one reason," he said of Mr. Rinfret. "Because they thought he was rich and would pay for his campaign. The people of the state of New York got shortchanged."
Bradford W. O'Hearn, the director of communications for Suffolk County, said, "He still steps on his best lines, but it's a huge improvement.
"Nobody has ever said that Lundine didn't have qualifications or intelligence, or that he doesn't work hard. All they've said is that he's dull. You can cure dullness. You can't cure dumbness."
 
Political Advantages
 Mr. Lundine is smart enough to play to his political strengths: his 20 years of governmental experience, six of them as mayor of Jamestown followed by 10 as a congressman representing a heavily Republican district in the Southern Tier. And he plays up his relationship with Mr. Cuomo, who himself was lieutenant governor before becoming governor.
Mr. Cuomo originally selected Mr. Lundine to give his ticket geographic balance, but now includes him in an inner circle that is notoriously small.
The Governor has assigned Mr. Lundine to rejuvenate the state's housing efforts, develop its anti-drug strategy, and coordinate its ultimately unsuccessful bid for a federally financed supercollider, a huge and expensive instrument for experimental physics. Some observers of the executive branch believe Mr. Cuomo has given Mr. Lundine such perilous portfolios to distance himself from the consequences in case of failure.
 
The Cuomo Factor
 Mr. Lundine realizes that his closeness to Mr. Cuomo may prove to be both an asset and a liability if he runs for governor himself, especially if public discontent with Mr. Cuomo boils over during a third term.
"It helps me in the sense that there is tremendous respect for Mario Cuomo," he said. "Some of that will be transferable in that I've been a working, contributing right hand.
"But the difficulty is that you would be running with all the liabilities of incumbency without the name recognition."
The Lieutenant Governor said that while campaigning, he has sensed the anxiety and anger of the electorate about the economy and the perception that government has not been responsive. But he has enjoyed the political freedom allowed by the unfocused campaign waged by Mr. Rinfret and his running mate, George F. T. (Geff) Yancey Jr., whom Mr. Lundine has never met.
The lack of a competitive race has afforded Mr. Lundine the luxury of dedicating some of this campaign to his long-term political ambitions. He said his performance on the stump and in the Capitol have convinced him that he is prepared to serve as governor, whether in 1994 or in 1992 should Mr. Cuomo run for and win the Presidency.
On that delicate issue, Mr. Lundine spoke with characteristic candor. "I suppose emotionally I would like to see him do it," he said. "I think it would be good for the country. And it'd be good for me."

HEADLINE: A Soviet Agent? Harry Hopkins?

BYLINE: By Verne W. Newton; Verne W. Newton wrote and co-produced the documentary film "Harry Hopkins: At F.D.R.'s Side."

DATELINE: BETHESDA , Md.

 BODY:
The former K.G.B. agent Oleg Gordievsky seems intent on making the same muddle of history that Kremlin planners have made of the economy. He has captured headlines by claiming that Harry L. Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's trusted friend and adviser, was an "agent of major significance" of the Soviet Union.
What is infuriating is how the West ern press is aiding Mr. Gordievsky's efforts to craft a best-seller. In the excerpts of his book, "KGB: The Inside Story," I have seen, he never calls Mr. Hopkins a spy. Yet headline writers do. The book says, "Hopkins was an American patriot with no admiration for either the principle or the practice of the Communist state." Absurdly, the author also says, "Hopkins had been an unconscious rather than a conscious agent."
What deeds did Mr. Hopkins commit that may, in the popular mind, attach the monicker "spy" to him? According to Mr. Gordievsky, who was in knickers when Mr. Hopkins died in 1946, the former social worker advocated positions favored by Moscow. Under this definition, King George VI and Ronald Reagan could be considered Soviet agents.
More specifically, Mr. Hopkins is accused of influencing the U.S. to accept Soviet control over Poland, the Baltic states and Romania. I hope Mr. Gordievsky provided more accurate information than this to British intelligence during the two decades he was allegedly a double agent.
As Mr. Gordievsky hits the book promotion trail, perhaps he can explain why he did not identify Winston Churchill as a Soviet agent. After all, Mr. Churchill entered into the highly secret, ill-advised "percentages" agreement with Stalin in October 1944, conceding major portions of Central and Eastern Europe to Soviet domination. Such cynical "spheres of influence" were anathema to Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Hopkins.
Mr. Hopkins refused to allow the White House to dispatch a cable to Mr. Churchill -- drafted by the Joint Chiefs and approved by the President -- out of fear that it might be construed as American approval for Churchill to enter into such arrangements with Stalin. In May 1945, Mr. Hopkins warned Stalin to his face that "the entire structure of world cooperation and relations with the Soviet Union would be destroyed" if he would not allow a free Poland to emerge from the ashes of war, as he had promised to do at Yalta.
Mr. Gordievsky indicts Mr. Hopkins for a post-Yalta euphoria. But as Sir John Martin, Mr. Churchill's principal private secretary, who was there told me, everyone, British and American alike, believed in the immediate aftermath of Yalta that they had just fashioned an enduring blueprint for peace and freedom. After five years of war, maybe they were entitled to a moment of euphoria.
Mr. Gordievsky is continuing the crusade started by Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin: half truths, innuendo, distortions, third-hand information -- all fused into a grand name-smearing indictment.
Like Senator McCarthy, if Mr. Gordievsky is to prosper he must make news. But the other revelations in his long-awaited book are rather thin gruel. He "solves" the insipid hunt for the so-called fifth man in the Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt spy circle by offering up an individual who confessed to being a Soviet agent nearly 25 years ago. And his salutation to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg as "dedicated and courageous Soviet agents" merely echoes the more authoritative voice of Nikita S. Khruschev.
Gen. George C. Marshall predicted that Mr. Hopkins's enormous contributions to his country would never be appreciated. But then, as that renowned savant Senator McCarthy warned us, General Marshall was always in Stalin's hip pocket.

HEADLINE: Even If Sanctions Are Lifted, Few Will Rush to South Africa

BYLINE: By JAMES S. HENRY; James S. Henry is a journalist, economist and lawyer who has written widely about the problems of developing countries.

 BODY:
FORCES now seem to have been set in motion for lifting economic sanctions against South Africa -- a prospect acceptable to a growing number of blacks and whites. The effect this will have on a badly weakened South African economy or on the future of American business there is far less clear.
Events in recent days, if the forces behind them are not reversed, are pointing the way toward lifting the sanctions as early as March, according to a senior United States State Department official. 
 Emergency rule in South Africa, under which some 30,000 political arrests were made during the last four years, was lifted Oct. 18 in the last province where it was still imposed. The ending of such rule was a key condition set by the United States Congress for removal of the American sanctions imposed in 1986 as an anti-apartheid tactic.
Another condition was the freeing of all political prisoners. South African President F. W. de Klerk has moved toward meeting that condition, as well. On Oct. 8, he and Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, agreed on a schedule to repatriate 20,000 exiles and free all remaining political prisoners by April.
A series of interviews suggest that it will be much later than next March before American businesses, which were slower than some Europeans to begin pulling out of South Africa, renew their South African ties. Several European countries have already begun to resume South African operations.
The first sanctions were imposed in the late 1970's, when the United Nations banned military sales to South Africa, and Sweden and Britain adopted limits on trade, investment and cultural and sporting contacts.
Although the United States moved more gradually, 26 states and 100 municipalities, in addition to the Federal Government, now have bans or limits on investment in or commerce with South Africa. With the 1986 Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, Congress banned most new direct investment, air transport and imports of coal, steel, uranium, textiles and farm products from South Africa. A 1987 statute abolished tax credits for United States affiliates in South Africa, and a 1983 law instructs the United States to vote against lending by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Combined with an economic slowdown and increased political unrest, these measures have effectively halted the growth of United States direct investment in South Africa, which had increased from $490 million in 1966 to $2.6 billion in 1981. Since then, 214 of 324 United States companies have withdrawn, and investment has dropped now to $711 million, even lower than South Africa's direct investment in the United States.
White leaders have generally said the sanctions hurt blacks and whites alike by slowing the economy. Many black leaders say the sanctions worked well. "The single most important factor in changing the Government has been the sanctions,"said Dr. Allan Boesak, a leader of the South African Council of Churches, referring to Pretoria's gradual relaxing of apartheid laws. But he said too that, if these changes are not reversed, the sanctions should be removed because the nation needs the economic boost.
UNITED STATES business spokesmen are generally cautious about being a part of that boost. Roger Crawford, an executive at Johnson & Johnson's South African affiliate, said most companies that left will be very slow to go back. "It's very difficult to re-enter a society like that one when you have built up trust over the years and then just pull the plug," he said.
Johnson & Johnson is now the third-largest American employer in South Africa, with a $60 million investment and 1,500 employees. "Lifting sanctions won't affect our investment until the economy recovers and there's growth in the hospital sector," Mr. Crawford said.
Ford Motor Company was once one of South Africa's largest American employers, with its 42 percent ownership of SAMCOR. SAMCOR had a $150 million assembly plant in Port Elizabeth that employed 6,500 workers, 70 percent black or Asian. In 1987, Ford gave 24 percent of SAMCOR's stock to a worker-owned trust and sold the rest to Anglo-American, South Africa's largest corporation. William P. Kelley of Ford said the company had no arrangement to buy back its position and has no plans to re-enter South Africa: "The market was not very profitable then, and you'd need much higher growth to make it attractive."
For Coca-Cola, returning to South Africa would create problems with its new partner, neighboring Swaziland. In the mid-'80's, Coca-Cola was the second-largest American employer in South Africa. Its $60 million concentrate and bottling company employed 4,765 workers, 85 percent of them black or Asian. It sold out in 1986 and now supplies South African bottlers from a new concentrate plant in Swaziland. Brandt Davis of Coke said, "Reinvesting in South Africa would require shutting down this plant, increasing black unemployment in Swaziland." He indicated a strong reluctance to leave Swaziland.
JOHN LORD, a spokesman for Mobil Oil, said: "We're gone; we're out." Mobil, once the fourth-largest American employer, with $400 million invested in 1,200 service stations and 2793 employees, sold out to Gencor Ltd., an Afrikaner-owned conglomerate, in June 1989. Under the sale terms, Mobil may not return for six years.
 Caltex Petroleum, a joint venture of Texaco and Chevron, is South Africa's largest remaining American employer, with a $400 million oil refinery and about 2,000 workers in Durban, half of whom are black or Asian. Bill Dunning, a Caltex vice president, chairs the group of 61 United States companies that observe the Sullivan Principles, a code of conduct that bars racial discrimination at the facilities of the signers. Dunning said that Caltex has been adversely affected by the American sanctions, especially the Rangel amendment that eliminates tax credits. But he also said that the company is not likely to increase its investment if the sanctions are lifted, because "we're sized correctly for the market."
Most executives of American companies see barriers to early reinvestment that have little to do with the sanctions. Like Mobil, some are contractually precluded. There is also what Steve Davis of the Investor Responsibility Research Council called the "hassle factor." Many companies are still smarting from lashings taken during angry board meetings. "They're not eager to go back before the dust clears," he said.
Probably even more significant is the fact that for many companies South Africa is not as attractive to investors as it once was. The economic picture, with or without American investment, is bleak for the short term.
Prof. Merton Dagut, chairman of the economics department at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, said that by the early 1980's South Africa's mining industries -- gold, platinum and diamonds, principally -- were already reaching their natural limits. Real growth declined from more than 5 percent a year in the '60's to less than 2 percent in the '80's. South Africa failed largely to develop export industries, for example, with the exception of arms. And apartheid created enormous social problems -- six million squatters, the world's most unequal wealth distribution, and high rates of disease, illiteracy and violence -- none of which helped business. "Given all these problems," Professor Dagut, said, "merely lifting sanctions wouldn't relieve the fears that many investors have about the future."
Growth has already been negative for more than a year. By American economic definitions, that constitutes a recession. And the Iraqi oil shock has badly depressed the price of gold, which South African economist Dr. Ronnie Bethlehem said "still drives the rest of the economy. "If it's below $400 an ounce you won't get much foreign investment even if sanctions are lifted. And if gold were $600, as in 1981, we'd be flooded with investment, even with sanctions."
According to Prof. Dagut, South Africa will contract even further: "The recession is likely to last deep into 1991. This is a social disaster: With the labor force growing at 3 percent, we need to grow at 5 percent just to stay even. Already a quarter of the work force is underemployed."
LONGER term, however, observers remain more optimistic. Caltex's Bill Dunning said, "South Africa has an exceptionally bright future; the only question is when." Joseph LaBonte, the former chief executive of Reebok, has been recruiting Fortune 100 C.E.O.'s whose companies have never invested in South Africa to explore opportunities with the African National Congress leadership. According to Mr. LaBonte, "More than half the Fortune 100 have never invested in South Africa. The country needs whole new industries to serve people -- housing, training, medical care, education. So tomorrow's foreign investors may be different, but that's not a bad thing."
Indeed, South Africa could eventually lure investors again. With 6 percent of sub-Saharan Africa's population, South Africa produces half its industrial output. In addition to minerals, it has many industries with growth potential, including tourism, medicine, wine, fruit, fishing and financial services. Its athletes, musicians, actors and writers are among the best in the third world. And at least in part because of the sanctions, it has a modest foreign debt, no dependence on foreign aid and a small budget deficit.
So, given political stability, the economic promise is there. As one economist joked, "Maybe we should have imposed sanctions on the rest of the third world."
 
 
SOME SAY SANCTIONS ARE STILL NEEDED
ALTHOUGH more and more black South Africans are coming to the view that economic sanctions imposed against their country should soon be lifted, the belief is far from unanimous.
Some anti-apartheid activists in the United States and some members of Congress remain concerned that removing the sanctions could reverse the progress made in recent months toward dismantling or weakening South Africa's apartheid laws.
Anne Griffin of Transafrica, an anti-apartheid lobbying group in the United States, said in an interview that South African President F. W. de Klerk "should be happy sanctions haven't been increased." Representative Howard Wolpe, a Michigan Democrat, said, "There still are no real negotiations going on yet. De Klerk needs sanctions to keep people serious."
So far, the official position of the African National Congress with regard to the sanctions remains unchanged. Tito Mboweni, of its Department of Economic Policy, said, "We're still supporting them. The political process is very uncertain."
But other apartheid opponents have grown impatient.
Halton Cheadle, a lawyer for COSATU, the country's largest union federation, said only a bare majority of its members favor sanctions and that SACTU, the third-largest union, is definitely opposed. The economy is in terrible shape, and the political change seems clearly irreversible, he said. Mr. Cheadle is in favor of easing the sanctions. Prof. Pieter LeRoux, a Capetown University economist who helped draft the A.N.C.'s latest economic-policy statement, agreed. "Sanctions did their job, but the case against lifting them now is very weak. If de Klerk waivered, you could always reimpose sanctions."
Last May, Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu also supported permitting selective investments in housing and education, and in September he said that the time for lifting sanctions is approaching.
 Dr. Allan Boesak, a leader of the South African Council of Churches, said that "the whole question is under discussion right now. My own view is that it may be time to lift cultural sanctions, but economic sanctions should stay on until there are elections for a constituent assembly."
Denis Beckett, a leading South African journalist, said, however, that waiting for such elections "could take years. Most people feel its just plain stupid" to keep the sanctions in place. "But the people are out in front of the A.N.C. on this issue. The problem is, the A.N.C. doesn't have many other bargaining chips."

HEADLINE: Consumers Found Gloomier

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Confidence among consumers sank this month to its weakest level since the nation struggled through a recession eight years ago, a research group said Friday.
In addition, more and more Americans expect the economy to get worse, the Conference Board said. 
 The Consumer Confidence Index plunged 24 points in October, the biggest one-month drop since the index began more than 20 years ago. The October reading was 61.3, a level not seen since the 16-month recession of 1981-82, the board said.
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the gross national product, so a drop in confidence ripples through the economy.
The index, based on a 1985 base of 100, was at 101.7 in July, before Iraq invaded Kuwait and upset world financial markets.
Buying plans have been curtailed, people expressed difficulty finding jobs and 30 percent of those surveyed believe business conditions will worsen in the next six months, the board said. Last month only 20 percent said they expected conditions to worsen.
In October there was a sharp drop in the number of consumers who consider current business conditions good and a big increase in those who say they are bad, the board said.
The survey found 15 percent of people thought jobs were plentiful, compared with 30 percent who said they were hard to get. More than 35 percent of respondents fear there will be fewer jobs in the immediate future.
The board said only 6.2 percent of consumers plan to buy a car in the next six months, down from the 7.8 percent who said in September that they were planning an auto purchase.
The survey was conducted among 5,000 households nationwide and has a margin of error of three percentage points.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
A COMMERCIAL version of the hit television show "America's Funniest Home Videos" has been created by J. Walter Thompson for its new client Toys "R" Us.
The $15 million campaign, which begins tonight, features dozens of candid shots of children -- and adults -- playing with toys. The results are often amusing and a fascinating interpretation of the company's long-time theme, "I don't want to grow up; I'm a Toys "R" Us kid." 
 One spot focuses primarily on adults, with people trying, and failing, to use the simplest toys. A man throws a small wooden glider and it immediately crashes at his feet, whereupon a disdainful child chases after him and kicks him in the shins. Badminton players get entangled in their net. And a woman riding a tiny tricycle pedals into a swimming pool. There also are, of course, the obligatory shots of hopelessly inept adults struggling with Hula-Hoops.
What makes these commercials powerful is watching people make fools of themselves.
In these commercials, the scenes were not staged. The agency cast about 200 non-actors, whom it found by advertising in local newspapers in the Long Island resort town of East Hampton. Children and adults picked their toys and set out to have a little fun. The goings-on were filmed by cameramen using telephoto lenses.
"We had to make sure that people weren't aware they were being photographed," said Linda Kaplan, a group creative director at the agency. "Otherwise they would have been too self-conscious to have fun."
The agency also did not tell people what to do or interfere once the action began. While the strategy paid off with some wonderful candid footage, it also made for a long, tedious production. "We filmed people for hours when essentially nothing interesting was happening," Ms. Kaplan said.
After the two weeks of shooting for the commercial, many of the toys used were donated to children's hospitals and orphanages.
This is Thompson's second go-around with Toys "R" Us. The agency lost the account six years ago and won it back in March.
The television campaign is not intended to sell particular toys, said Ernie Speranza, the vice president of marketing and advertising at Toys "R" Us Inc., based in Paramus, N.J. "We leave that to the individual manufacturers." he added. "We want to create a brand-name image for the store as a fun place to go shopping for toys."
With annual sales of about $5 billion, Toys "R" Us has a commanding lead in the $15 billion toy market, Mr. Speranza said.
The company intends to use the commercials in other parts of the world. Toys "R" Us has been aggressively expanding in Europe and East Asia and plans to have 100 stores overseas by the end of this year.
Toys "R" Us has also begun its largest print campaign, in which some popular items like Nintendo video games and Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtle toys are spotlighted. The company figures that when times get tough economically, it is the best time to take business from competitors.

HEADLINE: Speaking About Spending Less, Cuomo Has Spent More

SERIES: LAST OF A SERIES OF ARTICLES ON MARIO M. CUOMO'S RECORD AS NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct 28

 BODY:
Early in his first term, when the state was faced with a debilitating budget deficit, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo adopted the slogan, "We must learn to do more with less." He recited it to anyone who would listen: to commissioners hoping to expand their agencies, to lawmakers looking to extend the state's largess, even to hospital workers seeking higher pay.
"We must not in this state fall victim to the doctrine that the only way to make progress is to spend massively," Mr. Cuomo said at the opening the 1984 legislative session. "We must find new opportunities to domore with less." 
 As Mr. Cuomo seeks a third term, he is once again faced with an unnervingly large budget shortfall that is likely to grow worse. The Governor no longer speaks stirringly about doing more with less. Instead, he finds himself defending the growth in state spending during the last eight years, when the state's credit rating dropped to the lowest ever and state spending almost doubled.
"It doesn't seem that he could ever see if he could do more with less because he never had less," said Steven D. Gold, director ofthe State University of New York's Center for the Study of the States.
In the mid-1980's, when the New York economy was expanding at an almost giddy rate, it was easy for state government to be generous and for Mr. Cuomo to maintain the stance of a fiscal conservative. So fast did the state's wealth grow in the mid-1980's that in 1987 the Legislature enacted a four-year income-tax cut, which Mr. Cuomo opposed at the time but claimed credit for later. Still the state appeared to be flush.
 
Good Times Gone to Bad
 But when the economy began to contract, the state's spending quickly became unaffordable. Increasingly, the Cuomo adminstration resorted to borrowing and accounting tricks to pay its bills, and many critics asserted that the Governor refused to make the cuts needed to bring spending in line.
"You can really be very critical of the state in terms of its refusal to bite the bullet on balancing its budget," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses.
Since Mr. Cuomo took office eight years ago, state spending has increased 92.6 percent, or an average of 8.5 percent a year, to $50 billion. Adjusted for inflation, the increase is 22 percent, meaning that state spending in constant dollars has grown by about a fifth.
Cuomo administration officials justify the growth as a reasonable response to the state's ever-expanding social needs. "Important efforts were made to increase services in areas where they were vitally needed," said the Governor's budget director, Dall W. Forsythe, "like AIDS, Medicaid, criminal justice." Cuomo administration officials also note that Federal aid has declined over the last eight years.
In response to assertions that his has been a big-spending administration, Mr. Cuomo often notes that the rate of spending growth has actually been lower than in many other states.
Figures from the National Association of State Budget Officers show that in the last eight years, general fund spending, which does not include Federal grants or capital projects, increased an average of 7 percent a year in New York. The average increase for all Northeastern states was 7.5 percent a year, and for large industrial states, 8 percent a year.
But critics contend that the comparisons are misleading. New York State spending was already so high when Mr. Cuomo took office, they say, that even though other states have increased their budgets more quickly, New York still far outspends them.
 
Deteriorating Fiscal Condition
 "The New England states and New Jersey had big increases during this period, but they started much, much lower," Mr. Gold said. Last year, according to the Census Bureau, per capita state spending in New York -- $2,554 -- was 35 percent higher than the national average.
In good times, the spending growth was relatively easy to sustain, and despite the increases, spending as a percentage of the state's wealth has remained fairly constant during Cuomo's tenure. It amounted to roughly 9 percent of personal income in the state in 1983, according to figures compiled by the Citizens Budget Commission, and it amounts to roughly 9 percent today.
Over the last two years, however, as the economy has slowed, New York's fiscal condition has deteriorated by almost every measure. The state's long-term or accumulated deficit has grown to more than $5 billion, a record. Budget shortfalls have seemed chronic, and the state has increasingly come to depend on reserves and refinancing to pay its bills.
Last year, in a reflection of the state's weakening finances, its credit rating declined to the lowest in its history and the third lowest in the nation.
 
Tough Problems and Solutions
 Critics lay much of the blame at the Governor's door. The Governor, they contend, should have responded to the state's dramatic revenue shortfalls with equally dramatic spending cuts. But instead, they assert, he drained the state's reserves and relied on nonrecurring revenues.
"We didn't see a state that was trying to dig itself out of a hole," said Cynthia Green, a senior analyst at the Citizens Budget Commission. "We saw a state that basically didn't stop digging."
Even the Governor has acknowledged recently that the state, having used up most of its reserves, is heading for grim times. "The truth is we're going to have a difficult time with finances," he said in a recent interview.
But even as the state's fiscal condition continues to decline, Mr. Cuomo defends his record of the last few years. He takes credit, for example, for the historic agreement last spring under which the state is finally supposed to pay off its $5 billion deficit over the next 30 years. And he asserts that his administration has done far better than those of other states.
 
Cutting the Top Income-Tax Rate
 Despite hard times, Mr. Cuomo often notes, New York has not raised its income or sales taxes. And whenever possible, the Governor mentions that New York's top income-tax rate, which has dropped from 14 percent to almost 7.9 percent in the last eight years, is the lowest in three decades.
"We are getting more competitive by not raising our income and sales taxes," the Governor said recently.
But New York has raised just about every other tax imaginable in Mr. Cuomo's tenure, including those on alcohol, petroleum products, soda, hotel rooms and corporations. Both this year and last, the Governor signed record tax increases that totaled almost $3 billion. And in the spring, he successfully pressed for a deferral of the last year of the state's income-tax cut, which would have reduced the state's top income-tax rate to 7 percent.
Administration officials insist that during the Governor's tenure, cuts in state income taxes have equaled increases in other state taxes. But figures compiled by Mr. Gold of the State University show that state taxes as a proportion of personal income has risen slightly in the Cuomo years, from $7.30 for each $100 of personal income earned in the state in 1983 to $7.55 in 1989.
 
Progress of Good Times Ignored?
 Per capita, New Yorkers pay some of the highest state taxes in the country today, just as they did when Mr. Cuomo took office. The state's per capita tax burden -- $1,480 -- was the sixth highest in the country last year, according to the Census Bureau.
While acknowledging the state's fiscal problems, Cuomo administration officials complain that many of the administration's achievements have been ignored in the economic downturn.
They note, for example, that the Governor inherited a large budget deficit in 1983, but managed to balance the budget within a few years. For a time, he even succeeded in raising the state's credit rating. And the state finally adopted generally accepted accounting principles, which forced it to keep track of how much it was spending.
"I think that what we lose in these discussions is the sense of the progress that was made in good times," the Governor's budget director, Mr. Forsythe, said.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS ADJOURNS: ADVANTAGE: DEMOCRATS;
Bush Loses a Game, But Stays in Match

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
As the 101st Congress adjourned early this morning, Democrats were thanking no one more than George Bush himself for a sudden improvement of their political fortunes.
 The deficit-reduction package that the President initiated clearly inflicted more political damage on Republicans than Democrats in the short run, which almost certainly includes the eight days between now and the Nov. 6 elections. 
 But left open is whether Democrats would gain as much politically in the long run and, perhaps more importantly, whether this budget deal was Washington's first step into a new and more realistic era of budget policy.
 
Political Damage Is Real
 President Bush's decision to abandon his "no new taxes" stance and accept the higher taxes included in the budget package had twin political effects. It divided his own party in a battle over whether taxes should rise and it unified the normally fractious Democrats, who found themselves on the much more appealing political ground of whom to tax rather than whether to tax.
Senior Democrats said they could barely believe that the Administration had allowed the final debate to revolve around whether the wealthy or everyone else should pay the bill. Faced with what the Democrats hope will be a newly effective message of economic fairness, Republicans denounce it as demagoguery. Perhaps so. But the political damage to Republicans is real enough.
Mr. Bush has taken a precipitous tumble in public opinion polls. Only 48 percent of Americans approve of his handling of his job according to Newsweek's latest survey, of 753 adults. That is the low point of his Presidency.
Two months ago, buoyed by Mr. Bush's showdown with Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Republicans actually thought they might defy the normal law of politics and pick up seats at the middle of the Presidential term, or at least lose very few. Now they are talking about minimizing their losses.
 
A General Public Restlessness
 While much of this decline is clearly a restlessness in the public caused by a deteriorating economy, Mr. Bush's missteps and reversals in the budget debate have exacerbated his problems, and his party's.
Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee, said this was the only time he could find in modern political history when the electoral tide has completely reversed so close to the voting.
It is also the first time in more than a decade that Democrats have had the clear upper hand in an argument over taxes and the economy. But that raises additional questions.
Have the Democrats acquired an advantage that will carry into the next Congress and the 1992 Presidential race? Or will Mr. Bush be able, as he attempted this weekend, to reassert the Republican posture as the more dependable party for keeping down taxes? Moreover, if Republicans under fire are retreating to this tried and true position, does that damage the hopes for further deficit reduction?
While the promise of low taxes is appealing to the Republican Party's traditional constituency, it has also been crucial in holding white ethnic voters in the Republican coalition, a bloc that has already been held together longer at the Presidential level than history would suggest was possible. So it was no small matter when Mr. Bush said in a campaign appearance in Hawaii on Saturday that the deficit package was a one-shot deal. From here on, he said, he was "absolutely going to hold the line on taxes."
 
The Fairness Predicament
 Even more politically explosive is the question, skirted in this deficit-reduction agreement, of whether the country can afford the steadily rising costs of benefits for health and retirement of millions of realtively well-to-do people.
Where does the theme of fairness take Democrats in any serious discussion of fiscal policy? So far the only thing they have promised is to revive in the next Congress their proposal for a surtax on the rich, a levy that produces good headlines but little money. Will Democrats embrace higher taxes or limits on benefits for affluent Social Security recipients?
The fairness issue seems to hold great promise for them while Republicans are mishandling it, but exactly the same thing was true of the abortion issue a year ago. That matter, which appeared to be a turning-point question in many elections, has now lost at least some of its punch as candidates have learned to deal with it effectively.
Democratic leaders concede, too, that their unity was in good measure a fortunate byproduct of events. Sustaining it will not be easy. After all, it was only parliamentary maneuvering by the Democratic leadership in the Senate that prevented an alliance of Democrats and Republicans from cutting capital gains taxes, the very sort of reduction that, when sought by President Bush, forms Exhibit A in the Democratic case that Mr. Bush favors the wealthy.
Even in the final budget votes, some Democrats, particulary those from New Jersey and Massachusetts, defected because of the volatile environment in their states over tax increases.
When Newsweek asked its cross-section of Americans last week whether they thought President Bush was losing political influence, two-thirds replied yes.
That is a deep political hole to climb out of, but no deeper than the one overcome by Ronald Reagan, who at this point in his Presidency was even lower in the surveys as the country struggled through the recession of 1982.
The White House was understandably frustrated that Mr. Bush had taken such a political pummeling for his willingess to assemble the first serious package to restrain the deficit.
But it may not be beyond salvaging. It is still possible that with some repair work by the White House and a soon-to-be-organized re-election campaign, Mr. Bush will gain credit for doing "the right thing" on the deficit, as one of his lieutenants put it.
"I must say I think it's a measure of a person when they take the heat he's taken over this budget," said Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader. "He could have cashed in last week and said, 'We'll pull the plug and blame the Congress.' We talked about it. He said no."

HEADLINE: New York City's Budget Gap Is Even Worse Than It Looks

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
New York City has a budget of more than $28 billion and a projected gap in it for the coming fiscal year of perhaps $2 billion -- in other words, it is short one dollar for every 14. But the problem is really more severe, because the budget over which the city has full control is closer to $12 billion, and that means it is short one dollar for every six.
That little-understood reality, compounded by a stagnant economy and uncertainties about the cost of wage settlements, is why the city's current troubles have evoked dire threats of thousands of layoffs and the worst cuts in city services since the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. 
 The roughly $12 billion is what remains after the city pays its share of welfare and Medicaid costs, after it pays for pensions of workers long retired and for debt service on bonds long issued, and after it discounts state and Federal aid over which it has little control.
 
Balance Required by Law
 Adding to the administration's problems are wage settlements. A spokesman for one of two large municipal unions said yesterday that the unions, which represent more than 150,000 workers, planned to break off stalled talks with the city. [Page B1.]
Mayor David N. Dinkins, besieged by violent crimes this summer, has vowed to spare the criminal-justice system from deep cuts. But protecting the $2 billion in annual costs for the police, jails and the court system would give the Mayor even less room to maneuver, leaving a real budget of maybe $10 billion in which to find cuts or new revenues, fiscal experts say.
Keeping that budget in balance -- as required by law -- will require managerial and political choices about the goals the city values most and how to achieve them.
"The bad news is you're left with awful service reductions that seem repetitive and almost not even that shocking anymore -- firehouses being closed, potholes reappearing," said Anthony Shorris, a former City Finance Commissioner.
"But the good news is that the components of the budget are so clear, and the law is so clear, that the Mayor is forced to balance the budget, and he will. The interesting question is not whether the budget is balanced, because, of course, it will be. The real question is how it will be done."
Trimming anything like $2 billion from the remaining programs would heavily damage the core of municipal services -- from garbage collection to road repair, fire protection, parks maintenance, libraries and schools. The Dinkins administration has warned that 25,000 to 35,000 layoffs may be necessary if the worst comes to pass.
Even assuming a large tax increase next spring -- on top of the largest annual tax rises in state and city history to balance the current budget -- the cuts would be severe. Since the city would not want to lay off those workers whose salaries are borne partly by state and Federal aid, like social service caseworkers, or those who produce money, like tax auditors, the cuts would fall heaviest on basic services like sanitation.
That is why virtually no one wants the worst to happen. And the administration says it need not if labor unions with whom it is bargaining do not seek more than the 1.5 percent wage increase already accounted for in the city's budget.
New York City has the fourth largest government budget in the nation, after the Federal Government, California and New York State. But because of the laws and oversight rules that are a legacy of its brush with bankruptcy 15 years ago, it must keep its books balanced as strictly as those of a business.
 
Unlike a Business
 On the other hand, the enterprise that is New York is nothing like a business. It does not seek to earn a profit. Political realities, bureaucratic intertia and sheer size make it unable or unwilling to make the choices and to exact the efficiencies that a business can.
Making such choices seemed especially unpalatable, even uneccesary, in the decade-long boom in the city's economy that is now ending. In the administration of Edward I. Koch, about 80,000 workers were added to the labor force, which now numbers more than 300,000. The additions were presented as a sign of the city's recovery and a promise of better services.
But many of the new workers were hired to perform services that the city had little choice but to provide. For example, more than 5,000 of the net increase of nearly 8,000 workers planned for this year were for jobs required by law or regulation, over half of them in the Board of Education and social-service agencies. Those plans themselves were scaled back after a partial hiring freeze imposed as part of the latest retrenchment.
More than 1,500 of the new workers were for garbage recycling programs, to help save room in the city's dwindling dump, and for jails, to control an inmate population that has tripled to more than 20,000 in the last decade. About 2,000 others were to work in revenue-raising or cost-saving jobs.
 
Greater Productivity Needed
 Besides the possibility of layoffs, Mr. Dinkins's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, has warned that the city may have to cut 15,000 to 18,000 jobs through attrition. The city loses about that many workers each year to resignations and retirement, but because about half of those workers perform mandated services, the city cannot simply let all the positions fall vacant.
But even senior city officials now acknowledge that more scrutiny must be given to whether so many workers are needed, even if the functions they perform are required. That means getting more output from each worker, and that is perhaps the biggest challenge for an organization as sprawling as the city.
"There is less latitude in the budget than the public would imagine," said Henry J. Stern, the former Parks and Recreation Commissioner who is now president of the Citizens Union, a private watchdog group. "But there are a lot of ways they can cut. People are underused. But the problem is doing things sensibly.
"If the Chase Manhattan Bank had to cut 5,000 workers, they'd reduce middle managers and everyone," Mr. Stern said. "If the city had to do it, they'd fire all the tellers and close the bank at 1 o'clock in the afternoon," partly because of legal requirements that the least senior workers in each category be laid off first.
 
Cuts in Staff Resisted
 In the Koch years the city made a breakthrough in productivity by reducing the number of workers on a garbage truck from three to two. But it failed to achieve other gains of similar scope, and even now proposals for one-worker garbage trucks or one-officer police patrol cars meet with stiff political and union resistance.
At the same time, current and former city officials say, many newly appointed commissioners in the Dinkins administration, some from out of town, do not yet know the nooks and crannies of their agencies well enough to find likely spots for trims.
Others, including Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez and Fire Commissioner Carlos A. Rivera, have publicly resisted Mr. Dinkins's calls to meet specific percentage targets for trims to close a budget gap of at least $300 million in the fiscal year that ends June 30 and $1.5 billion in the next year.
The dynamics are difficult and little-understood. Mr. Fernandez maintained that asking for $94 million in cuts from the Board of Education was asking his agency for more than its share. But the board accounts for one-fourth of the entire city budget and has often been spared cuts in recent years when other agencies have made them. Even now, it has been asked to make cuts of 2 percent, half those asked of most other agencies.
 
Most of Budget Essential
 City budget officials like to say that about 70 cents of every dollar in city revenues is effectively spoken for by the time it arrives, just to carry out functions either required or considered vital.
Given that and expected shortfalls in tax revenues, the challenge is to do as much with less. Unlike a business, the city cannot easily close divisions or shed functions, especially since the probable buyer of last resort -- the state, which assumed the cost of the City University system, the courts and drug treatement in the crisis of the 70's -- is now in the midst of its own severe fiscal troubles.
But there are options, big and small. Mr. Stern said it used to cost the city $1 million a year to operate golf courses and driving ranges. Now it has let them to concessionaires, who give the city $1 million to $2 million a year in revenue.
Mr. Stern's successor as Parks Commissioner, Betsy Gotbaum, said she was seeking similar opportunities.
"Whatever the merits of socialism," Mr. Stern said, "it is no way to run a golf course."

HEADLINE: Talk of Government Being Out to Get Blacks Falls on More Attentive Ears

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
Until his brother became yet another black man to die of AIDS, Keith Brown never imagined that a disease so devastating would hit so close to home. Searching for an explanation, he found himself drawn to one his brother had long embraced but that Mr. Brown used to reject: that AIDS was invented by racist conspirators to kill blacks.
"Because of who's being devastated the most, and growing up in the U.S. and knowing the history of slavery and racism in this country," Mr. Brown said, "you can't be black and not feel that AIDS is some kind of experiment, some kind of plot to hit undesirable minority populations." Mr. Brown, 30 years old, virtually apologized for his belief, saying, "I hope I don't sound too radical, because I'm not." 
 "I don't want to believe that AIDS is some kind of Government plot," he said. Then, pausing, he added: "But I guess I do. I do believe it."
Mr. Brown is one of a large and perhaps growing number of blacks turning to racial conspiracy theories to explain black America's ills. The theories vary widely, as do their believability, the backgrounds of the blacks who support them and the degree of support each receives.
 
Suspicion From Distrust
 The startling theory that AIDS is a weapon of racial warfare is the one with the fewest adherents. A more popular theory is that white government leaders play a pivotal role in the drug crisis by deliberately making drugs easily available in black neighborhoods. And the theory with the most support is that white prosecutors conspire to bring groundless charges against black elected officials.
To some black officials, psychologists and scholars, such theories reflect the anger and suspicion bred by persisting racial inequality. In addition, some say, the theories have practical consequences in the barriers they pose to fighting AIDS and drugs.
Some who embrace the theories are political militants. Others, like Mr. Brown, are soft-spoken moderates. While some blacks espouse the theories as firm convictions, others talk of them in tones of mild suspicion, as possibilities they are willing neither to embrace nor dismiss.
While black Americans have often suspected whites of conspiring against them -- and while those suspicions have at times been justified -- the theories about AIDS are new. And many say they believe the level of suspicion has never been higher. In more than 50 interviews, black public officials, professors, doctors, students, public-health workers and average citizens said that serious discussion of racial plots is now common, springing from an American soil rich in racial distrust.
 
Statistics Paint Divided Portrait
 In a separate sounding, a New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll in New York City found that 10 percent of blacks said the AIDS virus was "deliberately created in a laboratory in order to infect black people." Another 19 percent said that theory might possibly be true, and 63 percent said it was almost certainly not true. Of the whites polled, only 1 percent said it was true, 4 percent said it was possibly true and 91 percent said it was almost certainly not true. The rest had no opinion.
A quarter of the blacks polled said that the government "deliberately makes sure that drugs are easily available in poor black neighborhoods in order to harm black people." A third said that might possibly be true, and a third said it was almost certainly not true. Of the whites polled, 4 percent said it was true, 12 percent said it was possibly true, and 75 percent said it was almost certainly not true.
Thirty-two percent of the blacks polled said "the government deliberately singles out and investigates black elected officials in order to discredit them in a way it doesn't do with white officials." Forty-five percent said this might possibly be true, and 16 percent said it almost certainly was not true. Of the whites, only 6 percent said it was true, and 28 percent said it was possibly true. Fifty-seven percent of whites said that theory was almost certainly not true.
The telephone poll of 1,047 adults throughout the city, including 408 blacks and 484 whites, was conducted from June 17 through 20. The margin of sampling error for blacks was plus or minus five percentage points; for whites, it was plus or minus four percentage points.
 
Reflecting Frustration, Neglect
 "The theory that AIDS and drugs are part of a white conspiracy to commit genocide or to damage the black community -- that's popping up in questions more and more," said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, the Harvard psychiatrist, who said he did not believe in the theories but saw them as a measure of frustration and neglect.
"I've heard it discussed among middle-class blacks who wouldn't in any sense be considered militant," he said. "It's spinning around out there."
Presented with the poll results, Dr. Poussaint said that the number of blacks who entertained the theory of AIDS as biological warfare was dismaying. "What do they think?" he said, "that there's a Nazi regime?"
Many observers agree that the figures point toward sores on the body politic. "It is a danger to America to have a large group of its citizens believe that its government is in a conspiracy to eliminate them," said Andrew Cooper, publisher of The City Sun, a black newspaper based in Brooklyn.
 
Feeling Powerless
 But besides their symbolic significance, the theories also have practical consequences. Public-health workers say that the discussion of AIDS as a plot against blacks has eroded the credibility of AIDS prevention campaigns and has made some blacks suspicious of AIDS tests and treatments.
"If I had as many people out there pushing the combat against AIDS as I have pushing the notion that it's a white man's plot, we would be winning the battle," said Dr. Beny J. Primm, a black official in the United States Department of Health and Human Services, who was a member of President Reagan's Commission on AIDS.
In addition, some blacks worry that talk of white plots may undermine struggles outside the realm of AIDS, including those for jobs and education. In assigning so much power to white society, they say, the theories have the potential to make blacks think of themselves as powerless victims.
"If you actually believe that the society in which you live is feeding AIDS and drugs to you, to eliminate you, you're not going to see your own possibilities in that society," said Shelby Steele, a professor of English at San Jose State University. "You're not going to make the effort to move into the American mainstream. It's a profoundly destructive belief."
That view is not universal. Some black officials, while agreeing that a significant number of blacks are considering the conspiracy theories, say the suspicion about AIDS and drugs could have positive effects. "If you think of yourself as a victim, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be passive about it," said Dr. Billy E. Jones, the New York City Mental Health Commissioner. Dr. Jones said blacks who believe whites are trying to kill them with AIDS or drugs might become more likely to use condoms or to resist pushers.
 
The Forms
 
From Statistics To Intuitions
By their nature, conspiracy theories and the evidence to support them take many shapes. Some people cite what they call damning dates and documents, while others say proof is elusive. Some say government agencies are behind the plots; others call them the acts of racists outside the government. Sometimes the unnamed conspirators are simply known as "they."
Some blacks say the conspiracy theories are given credence by an American past of real plots against blacks, ranging from slavery to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's infiltration of civil rights groups. Many blacks recall the Tuskegee, Ala., syphilis study in which the Government withheld treatment from 399 black men from 1932 to 1972 to observe the progress of the disease.
Mr. Brown said his parents recently told him that a distant relative was among the Tuskegee blacks who went untreated. "When I heard that, it blew my mind," he said.
In addition, many say the conspiracy theories are lent credence by current bleaknesses: statistics that show more black men in prison than in college, studies that show the mortality rate higher in Harlem than in Bangladesh, figures that indicate AIDS is spreading most rapidly among minorities. While blacks are 12 percent of the population at large, for instance, they account for 30 percent of the nation's 152,000 AIDS cases to date, according to the Federal Centers for Disease Control.
 
Known Simply as 'The Plan'
 Talk of white conspiracy against blacks can take almost limitless forms. For example, William Raspberry, a black columnist for The Washington Post, whose work is widely syndicated, wrote last December: "Let me make a speech before a black audience and sometime during the Q & A someone is certain to ask if I believe there is a conspiracy against black Americans. It doesn't matter whether the subject is drugs or joblessness, school failure or teen pregnancy, politics or immigration. I can count on hearing some version of the conspiracy question." In Chicago, an aide to former Mayor Eugene Sawyer was fired last year after arguing that Jewish doctors were injecting black babies with AIDS. In Washington, talk of concerted white action to discredit and destroy blacks is so common it has long been known simply as "The Plan."
The talk of white conspiracy reached a crescendo in Washington during the drug and perjury trial of Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., who was lured into a hotel room and given crack as part of an F.B.I. sting. Mr. Barry was convicted on one misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession, and sentenced to six months in prison.
 
The Settings
 
From Talk Shows To Q & A's
The charge that the AIDS and drug epidemics are white plots against blacks emerges in a variety of settings. Ronald Johnson, director of the Minority Task Force on AIDS, a private AIDS education group in New York City, said he is asked whether AIDS is a form of germ warfare in nearly every presentation he gives to a black audience.
"Invariably, someone will say that the virus was planted by the Government or the C.I.A. or by white people," he said. "This is not just low-income people, but middle class, working class, professionals -- everybody."
Mark Riley, a talk show host on WLIB radio in New York, whose audience is predominantly black, said callers often ask about conspiracies regarding AIDS and crack. "There are people who believe there's a conspiracy of neglect," he said. "But there are also a lot of people who believe the twin epidemics of AIDS and crack are the product of an active white conspiracy."
Mr. Riley described himself as "neutral" about the theories. "As an African-American who knows something about our history, I can't rule out conspiracy as regards AIDS or crack," he said. "A government plan, a scientific plan, a scientific plan that was condoned by government: any number of permutations are possible."
 
'A Means to Supress Blacks'
 Sometimes the charge takes the form of matter-of-fact reporting. "Blacks Intentionally Infected," announced a banner headline last year in The Los Angeles Sentinel, a black-owned newspaper. The paper's series reported, "the virus was made in an American military lab as a means to suppress blacks."
On other occasions, the talk of AIDS conspiracies has taken the form of idle talk show chitchat. Appearing on "The Arsenio Hall Show," Kool Moe Dee, a rap musician, said that AIDS was part of a "clean-up America campaign" intended to hit "target markets" of homosexuals and racial minorities.
"I think they definitely have the cure already and I think it was definitely created by some sick person," he said.
Mr. Hall treated the conversation as just another celebrity interview. "That's interesting," he said.
 
AIDS as Population Control?
 Last year, two members of the black studies department at the City College of New York spoke of AIDS as a white conspiracy in an appearance on the "Geraldo" show. "AIDS coming out of a laboratory and finding itself localized in certain populations certainly has to be looked at as part of a conspiratorial process," said Prof. Leonard Jeffries, the department chairman.
A visit to one of Professor Jeffries's classes indicates that many of his students share his views. After one class, a reporter talked to 10 black students, all of whom argued that AIDS and crack were part of a white conspiracy. They gave a variety of explanations for their views.
Dominique Bachemin, 20, offered impossible numbers in arguing that AIDS was created as a method of population control. "During the Carter Administration, there was a document put out that said by the year 2,000, one hundred billion Africans had to be destroyed," she said.
By contrast, another student, Mark Russell, 24, argued that the motive for an AIDS plot was simply economic, rooted in America's switch to a postindustrial economy. "I think it's a conspiracy because it's very strange that all the sudden this disease popped up out of nowhere and it hits populations that the government considers undesirable," he said.
 
'One Way of Getting Rid of Us'
 "There's no more need for black labor," he said. "So, you know, this is one way of getting rid of us."
In the case of AIDS, the talk of conspiracy has been fueled by the nature of the disease itself: its mysterious origins and the eerie way it has seemed capable of singling out populations. For that reason, AIDS conspiracy theories once circulated among white homosexuals, too, though gay groups rarely speak of them now.
While the discussion of AIDS as a white conspiracy against blacks is new, the charge that crack was invented to hurt blacks echoes debates from the 1960's over earlier drug epidemics. Essentially, the argument went like this: the authorities had little concern about combatting illegal drug use as long as it existed in predominantly black inner-city neighborhoods. They were more concerned once drugs reached the suburbs, where the majority of residents were white.
Now as then, many blacks say the government's failure to stop the crack plague is damning evidence of its complicity.
"If I know who the crack dealer is in the neighborhood, how come the police don't know?" Mr. Russell asked. "If the Government has planes that could pick up a safety pin from the ground from 30,000 feet in the air, how come they can't stop the planes from Colombia?"
 
The Ramifications
 
Hurting the War On AIDS and Crack
While there is no precise way to measure the impact of the conspiracy theories, many public-health workers fear the discussion is inhibiting the fight against AIDS and drugs.
"Unfortunately, the whole issue of AIDS and HIV as a conspiracy becomes a critical issue in discussing AIDS and HIV," said Dr. Jacob A. Gayle, special assistant for minority AIDS coordination at the Centers for Disease Control. "I think it's a significant public-health issue because it enables people to dismiss their own personal risk and responsibility if they say it's something other people are doing to them."
Some public-health workers say the conspiracies erode their credibility. Marilyn Ng-A-Qui, executive director of the Sister-to-Sister program, an AIDS counseling effort in Brooklyn, said that when she speaks to black groups, "There is almost always someone in the audience that has the answer: AIDS is part of a plot, a white man's plan to eradicate black people."
"It makes my job harder because I have to devote time and energy to addressing those concerns," she said. "If I dismiss it out of hand, then those people who believe in it have turned me off."
 
Wary of Testing and Condoms
 Some public-health workers say the theories can also undermine their specific recommendations for fighting AIDS. They say they can make people wary of using condoms to avoid the disease, of early testing to detect it and of using drugs to treat it.
Dr. Primm, associate director of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration at the Department of Health and Human Services, said that black audiences sometimes regard the recommendation to use condoms as part of the same plot that produced the AIDS virus. "People say if the government is telling us to use condoms, it's because they're participating in genocide -- they don't want us to multiply," he said.
He said the same mind-set sometimes makes black patients resistant to taking AZT, the main drug for treating AIDS. "They say the government is experimenting on us," he said.
Dr. Primm said the talk of plots could undermine efforts to treat drug addiction as well. It has, for instance, intensified attacks on programs that use methadone to treat heroin addicts. Critics often say "it's a tool to enslave, to control, all the buzzwords," he said. "And it's ridiculous. Ridiculous."
Others fear that the talk of white plots may harm not only the physical health of black America but the spiritual health as well.
"When you put out theories like genocide you make victims think they have no power, that they can't help themselves," said Dr. Poussaint, the Harvard psychiatrist. "It gives one more excuse for not taking responsibility."

HEADLINE: Prosperous Town Braces for Leaner 90's

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RAMSEY, N.J., Oct. 26

 BODY:
From the storefronts of Main Street to the shops along Franklin Turnpike, merchants here can see the end of the 80's across their counters, in sagging sales of everything from lumber to liquor, from bicycles to auto-repair equipment.
With few exceptions, business people in this upper-middle-class Bergen County suburb say their customers have cut spending. The merchants in turn have reduced their inventories and their orders for goods, creating more drag on the slowing regional economy. 
 The merchants say they see many economic gremlins worrying buyers: layoffs on Wall Street, tighter credit, a glut of unsold homes, higher gasoline prices, the Persian Gulf crisis, the state tax increases initiated by Gov. Jim Florio and the prospect of higher Federal taxes.
Economists say there are sound reasons for the town's consumers to be cautious.
 
Fewer 'Double-Digit Wines'
 "I think Ramsey's a microcosm of what's happening in the Northeast," said Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics at Rutgers University. "We have accelerating inflation and slowing growth in employment and personal income. That's a very lethal one-two punch.
"Consumer psychology is switching to worrying about a job and what's going to happen in the next six months."
Everyday cost-consciousness is seen here in stores like Ramsey Liquors on West Main Street. "My Chivas Regal customers and my Dewar's customers who once bought two or three bottles a month buy one now," said the owner, A. Allan Capalbo.
Wine and beer sales are up, but there, too, consumers have changed behavior. "We aren't selling double-digit wines -- the $20 and $30 bottles -- as much," Mr. Capalbo said. "They're now looking at $6 and $10 bottles."
 
Signs of Overbuilding
 The slump is not deep enough to inspire talk of going broke or shutting down, especially after the robust 1980's. Those were banner years for shops in town and out along Route 17, one of the busiest shopping strips in New Jersey.
Retail spending in the borough rose to nearly $317 million in 1987, from about $160 million in 1982, pushing Ramsey, with 13,500 residents, from 57th to 33d in retail sales volume in the state, according to a Census Bureau survey.
Along with the brisk spending camenew office parks and condominiums, adding a sense of sprawl to Ramsey's image of a compact community of well-kept single-family houses.
But then came the signs of overbuilding and downturn. Many office buildings have vacant space. Timber Valley, a 220-unit condominium project, had 70 unitsunsold for three years until all were unloaded for bargain prices at a recent Sunday auction.
In the single-family house market, 150 houses are for sale, the most in years, said Tom Austin, a local real-estate broker and appraiser. In the last year, prices have dropped about 6 percent, and unsold houses now cost $235,000 to $260,000, he said.
"There are tons of buyers out there, but we're having a hell of a job getting the sellers to cooperate and lower the price," Mr. Austin said.
Local merchants talk of a shopping malaise and trouble collecting money from customers. And wholesalers here who sell their goods in the region and nation say a downturn is hitting them, too. Even when business is up, bad times are sometimes seen behind it.
Andre Hartmann sold 16 bicycles at his shop on East Main in August, down from the August average of 26 from 1986 to 1989. "I think people are scared about money," he said. "They see their neighbor can't sell his house and they get scared."
Out at the Ramsey Lumber Company, Todd Zecher, the owner, says his sales are off 40 percent from a $6 million peak in 1988. Fire ravaged his big yard in March 1989. But he says the biggest factor in his slump has been the sharp drop in new-home construction.
 
Truckloads, Not Boxcars
 Mr. Zecher did not hire any summer helpers this year, and he has cut his inventory of framing beams and other lumber. "I'm buying by truckloads instead of box cars."
Mike Rublino tells a similar story of retrenchment at the Ramsey Nursery and Garden Center on Franklin Turnpike. Saplings and evergreens left over from the spring forced him to cancel his usual fall order for that stock and buy more pumpkins and mums. "They're not high-ticket items," Mr. Rubino said. "You're talking $4, $5 and $10."
Mr. Rublino makes most of his money grooming shopping malls and office campuses and designing and planting the landscapes of new office parks and condominium projects. The upkeep work is stable, he said. But new landscaping, which costs at least $50,000 a job, has dropped because of the slump in the building industry, he said.
The Ramsey Outdoor Store, which specializes in gear for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreation, has cut its warehouse stock in half, said Ben Raucher, the manager.
"In the mid-to-late 80's, we carried 10 styles of down vests," he said. "Now we have three or four."
Not all is negative. Businesses involved in printing and graphics say their sales continue to grow. Al Purviance, owner of Minuteman Press, said the slump in housing sales had bolstered orders for real-estate sales brochures and unemployment had increased orders for resumes.
"Guys in their 50's come in and say all they need is five," Mr. Purviance said. "And then they come back in two weeks and say they need 1,000."
Thomas A. Schneider, owner of QPL, a photo company specializing in corporate advertisements, says he is benefiting because slow economic times prompt customers to bypass advertising agencies and public relations companies and deal directly with his office. Nonetheless, Mr. Schneider is wary. "There's no major acquisitions of equipment and we're triple-checking what we're investing in."
 
'No One Wants to Commit'
 Wholesalers here say the slowdown is not singular to Ramsey. Two involved in the auto industry -- Metropolitan Car-O-Liner, which sells hydraulic lifts and wheel alignment systems to garages from Maine to Virginia, and Wurth U.S.A., which sells nuts, bolts, tools and paint to repair shops and dealers nationwide -- both say their sales are down.
"Some of our equipment costs $30,000 and $35,000, and no one wants to commit to that kind of debt until they see which way the economy is going," said William Bologna, controller at Car-O-Liner.
At Daybreak Floral Distributors, which sells flowers to 500 retail shops in the New York region, Craig Hackenberg, the owner, says his sales growth has gone from a 50 percent increase in 1987 to stagnant now. He is trying to recoup by seeking more retail customers and cutting prices on weekend specials by 10 to 15 percent.
"Flower shops aren't buying as much because customers aren't spending as much," he said. "It's that simple."

HEADLINE: CONGRESS ADJOURNS;
$500,000 Federal Grant Buys a Lot of Grief for Lawrence Welk's Birthplace

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STRASBURG, N.D., Oct. 27

 BODY:
Isolated, windswept and scratching to survive, this dusty farming community, founded a century ago by Volga German immigrants from the Russian steppe, has never had a high profile.
But now, a rash of angry, often snide, remarks are being called in from around the country by people complaining that Strasburg, population 600, has become a vivid symbol of Government waste and special interest politics. 
 This is the childhood home of Lawrence Welk. And last week, the town won Congressional approval for a $500,000 grant to build a German-Russian museum, with a section devoted to the famous band leader, at the farm where he was born.
 
Economic Hopes
 The town, hurt badly by drought and falling farm prices, has pinned its hopes on tourism. It will try to attract some of the tourists that pass by Strasburg on their way to the Black Hills, more than 200 miles southwest of here.
But at a time when the nation is increasing taxes to try to balance its books, the Welk project raised hackles in Congress and quickened the salivary glands of radio talk show hosts. Now people from thousands of miles away are calling to upbraid the town.
"What will they do for an encore?" said Representative Silvio O. Conte, the Massachusetts Republican who launched the first salvo. "Earmark funds to renovate Guy Lombardo's speedboat? Or restore Artie Shaw's wedding tuxedo?"
Since then, the Welk Heritage committee, which operates in a small storefront on Main Street here, has been fielding calls that are sarcastic enough to bring cringes to the faces of the lovely Lennon sisters.
"I never know what's coming when the phone rings," said Sharon Eiseman, executive director of Welk Heritage Inc. "You get to start feeling very defensive."
 
Making Fun of Welk
 Many of the callers have made fun of the homespun style and old-fashioned gimmickry that served as a trademark for Mr. Welk, 87 years old, who lives in retirement in Los Angeles. (Mr. Welk used to return here every May to visit friends and family until the trip became too strenuous.)
The people in Strasburg say they don't make fun of other people's music, but concede that Mr. Welk's brand of entertainment is an easy target for sophisticates. To the people here, as in so many little towns and ethnic city neighborhoods, it was the kind of joyful music that once stirred the crowds at barnyard dances, neighborhood taverns and big weddings.
The people of Strasburg regard Mr. Welk as a hero, although many believe that John Schwab, a local farmer, was probably a better accordian player. And they are a bit wounded by the jokes and insults directed at their greatest source of civic pride.
"You people in New York have a lot of famous people, but we've just got Lawrence," Rasmus Dirk, a retired carpenter, said plaintively. "He's one of our boys."
The callers have a different view. "You're just a bunch of dumb. . . ," one man screeched, spicing his comments with a few profanities before hanging up.
 
Missing the Point
 Supporters of the project say critics miss the point. The museum, to be called the German-Russian Interpretive History Center, will not merely celebrate a successful band leader, but will also commemorate the experience and ambitions of a distinctive culture, illustrated by Mr. Welk's roots.
Townspeople have refurbished Mr. Welk's childhood home, a sod brick hut, later covered with wood siding, and its outhouse and barn to resemble the way they were for turn-of-the-century settlers.
"The idea is to give people an idea of how the pioneers of North Dakota lived," Mrs. Eiseman said.
The money for the Welk project will come from a United States Department of Agriculture fund that is set aside for economic development in struggling rural areas. The people here note that while critics object to the grant few have called to console them about pending cutbacks in the agriculture budget that will affect the town's residents.
"Anybody who has been to Strasburg can see that they can use some help," said Jean Broadshaug, the spokeswoman for Senator Quentin N. Burdick, Democrat of North Dakota, who was instrumental in getting the grant.
 
Times Have Changed
 Conditions on the Dakota Plains today are not as favorable economically as they were when Mr. Welk was a boy. Farmers can get only about $2 a bushel for wheat these days, a steep drop from what they once got.
Many farmhouses stand empty, and the few storekeepers left along Main Street struggle to keep their doors open. The long drought here threatens to push even more farmers into economic ruin. A prayerful sign at the edge of town gives thanks for any rain, and begs, "Please send more."
Townspeople say Mr. Welk, who only went to school through the third grade, and who never lost his distinctive accent, symbolized the aspirations of many first-generation Americans when he hit the road with his accordian some 65 years ago.
"It wasn't necessarily my kind of music," said Emily Benz, 31, who had driven 75 miles from Bismarck to take her children to the Welk farmhouse, a tiny home at the end of a gravel road.
"But he was a poor boy from nowhere who had a dream. And his people watched him make it to the big time."

HEADLINE: LAYOFFS ARE RISING EVEN AT COMPANIES IN GOOD CONDITION

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Many American companies are laying off workers now, rather than waiting to be hit by hard times as they have in the past. Some economists warn that this outburst of corporate preventive medicine increases the odds of a steep recession.
The number of people laid off in the United States has increased sharply since June, reaching the levels of the early months of the 1981-82 recession. While some companies, including Citicorp, Digital Equipment and McDonnell Douglas, are acting because sales and profits have already begun to shrink, many others, including General Electric's appliance division and Nordstrom department stores, are only anticipating such a downturn. 
 "Businesses are scared and they are cutting costs in anticipation of what they think might happen," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "That sort of cost-cutting keeps American companies competitive in the world marketplace. But pre-emptive layoffs can be self-fulfilling, frightening people into spending less, which further weakens the economy."
 
A Widespread Trend
 The layoffs, and a smaller number of outright dismissals, in recent months have come in the service sector as well as in manufacturing, reflecting a new interest in cost-cutting, particularly among retailers and financial-services companies. Manufacturers have practiced this sort of cost-cutting for a decade to make themselves more competitive.
"Recessions have become a good opportunity to improve productivity, often by dropping people and putting in automated equipment," said Martin N. Bailey, a senior fellow and productivity expert at the Brookings Institution. Such concerns about productivity have been cited in layoff announcements this month by Nordstrom, G.E., Saks Fifth Avenue and Burger King, among others.
Whatever the dynamics, the number of American workers who were temporarily laid off, as measured in Labor Department surveys, reached 1,127,000 in September, up from 918,000 in June. While September represented a particularly sharp jump, the total has been rising steadily from an average of 808,000 in the first half of 1989 -- the lowest level since the 1981-82 recession.
 
Defining Layoff
 While the more than seven million people who are unemployed include anyone 16 to 65 years of age who claims to be out of work and looking for a job, the number of layoffs is the number of people who say they are temporarily absent from work for reasons other than illness or vacation. They expect to be recalled to work, although whether the companies plan to do so is not considered in the Labor Department survey.
During the last recession, the number of people on layoff rose above one million in mid-1981, as the downturn was getting under way, and then climbed rapidly to a peak of 2.5 million in September 1982, swelling the ranks of the unemployed and pushing up the unemployment rate to more than 9 percent, a level that endured until a year after the recession had ended.
This time, the process seems to have begun earlier in the downturn and is proceeding more slowly. That is reflected in the unemployment rate, which has risen only gradually, reaching 5.7 percent last month, from 5.2 percent in June.
"Companies are managing their workers as they manage their inventories of unsold goods," said Leslie McNulty, research director of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. "They are trying to keep both sets of inventories -- employees and merchandise -- as low as possible."
 
Working Fewer Hours
 Various tactics are being used to hold down payrolls without running up the number of people let go. A major one is reducing workers' hours. Tens of thousands of workers are being told, in effect, to choose between a layoff and a shorter schedule, said Jack E. Bregger, a Labor Department economist. The number of people falling into this "slack work" category jumped to 2.65 million in September, from an average of 2.45 million for the first eight months of the year, the Labor Department said.
Another strategy is not to fill vacancies. Many smaller companies are responding to the weak economy, particularly in the Northeast, by not hiring for jobs that a year or two ago these companies said they could not fill because of a shortage of qualified applicants. Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton University labor economist, calls this failure to fill job openings a form of hidden layoffs, "in the sense that the openings disappear, rather than people in them," he said.
The reluctance to take on new workers is reflected indirectly in the Labor Department's data on temporary workers -- the workers supplied by companies like Manpower Inc. and Kelly Services Inc. Their numbers shot up to 1.2 million in 1989 from 400,000 in 1982. But in the last year, the total has remained at 1.2 million.
 
Greater Difficulty Finding Work
 Finally, the number of people laid off is also rising because those who have suffered this fate cannot find new work, either full time or part time. The result is that the median number of weeks that the unemployed are out of work has jumped to 6.2 weeks, from 5 weeks, where it had been all year until September.
"What is happening is that the number of people losing their jobs is going up slowly, but the total on layoff is rising more rapidly because people are staying out of work longer," said Thomas Plewes, a Labor Department official.
Across the nation, the staff reductions cut across business sectors but are heaviest among clerks, sales people, construction workers and lower-echelon supervisors and managers, according to Labor Department data. The department, in its monthly surveys of 60,000 households to determine fluctuations in employment levels, calculates people on layoff as a separate category within the nation's total unemployed.
During the long recovery after the 1982 recession, the total number on layoff rose above 1.1 million several times, mostly in response to widespread layoffs in the manufacturing sector. But in 1988, as cuts in manufacturing subsided, layoffs fell to an average of just over 800,000, the low point for the economic expansion that has lasted nearly eight years.
 
Effect on White-Collar Workers
 New cuts in manufacturing employment since mid-1989 have helped to reverse the layoff trend, but most of the people going on layoff now are clerical and administrative workers rather than blue-collar job holders.
"Blue-collar workers have a lot of job security built into their contracts, in trade-offs for wage freezes," Mr. Plewes said. "White-collar workers in manufacturing and the service sector don't have that security in the lower-echelon jobs, and they are getting hit now."
While most of the job cutbacks since June are showing up in the Labor Department data as temporary layoffs, there also has been a rise in the number of people who have been permanently terminated. The temporary layoffs since June total 319,000; over the same four-month period an additional 151,000 were terminated, the Labor Department reported, because of either corporate cutbacks or other reasons.
The pattern here has been the same as among those on layoff. The total number of people who were terminated, according to the Labor Department, rose during the corporate upheavals of the 1980's to about 2.3 million, fell to about 2 million in 1988 and in September of this year climbed to 2.4 million.
 
Giving 60 Days' Notice
 Aside from actual layoffs, the almost daily announcements of planned cutbacks make the problem seem worse to the public than it actually is. Many announcements are made in compliance with a recently enacted Federal law that requires 60 days' notice when more than 50 people are to be let go.
The Boeing Company, for example, gave notice in January that 2,500 workers would be laid off this year, mostly because of fewer military contracts. But so far only 400 layoffs have actually taken place, and by year's end the total will probably not be anywhere near the 2,500 goal, said Paul Binder, a Boeing spokesman. That is because, in the interim, resignations and retirements have produced the shrinkage that Boeing had originally planned to achieve through layoffs.
Similarly, General Electric met the 60-day requirement with its recent announcement that 500 workers will be laid off at its appliance factory in Louisville, Ky. But if the anticipated weakness in home appliance sales fails to materialize by the time the 60 days runs out, the 500 workers, or most of them at least, might keep their jobs.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS ADJOURNS;
Elderly Would Benefit From Curbs on Sale of Overlapping Health Insurance

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The tough new Federal standards for private health insurance that Congress approved Friday would prohibit the sale of overlapping health insurance to people like Grace and John Kossow, an elderly California couple who were persuaded to buy 29 policies in a 30-month period and billed for $22,011 in first-year premiums, or more than twice the couple's annual income.
"We told Jerry Brecht, the salesman, that we were not interested," Mrs. Kossow, who is 86 years old, said in a telephone interview from her home in Watsonville, near Santa Cruz. "But before he left, we had five policies. He kept coming back, and he could always explain why we could take more." Mrs. Kossow said they have let all the policies lapse. 
 The new Federal standards were added to the 1991 budget bill, which President Bush has said he would sign. They are intended to protect 23 million elderly and disabled Americans, who spent $15 billion last year for insurance known as Medigap policies. Medigap helps with costs not covered by Federal Medicare like the first day of hospital charges and prescription drugs.
The law would prohibit the sale of more than one Medigap policy to an individual. Consumer advocates and insurance industry spokesmen say a single Medigap policy is adequate for most people. The new law would also prohibit selling Medigap policies to the three million low-income elderly people covered by Medicaid.
 
Surge in Sales
 Sales of Medigap policies surged after Congress repealed a law last November that would have expanded Medicare coverage for high-cost catastrophic illnesses.
The new Federal law would extend to all states the insurance standards that are already enforced, in varying degrees, in a few states like California, Minnesota, Wisconsin and New York.
In one recent civil case, the Standard Life and Accident Insurance Company of Oklahoma City was fined $150,000 earlier this month in the California Superior Court in Santa Cruz. Don Gartner, an assistant district attorney in Santa Cruz, said the company, a unit of the American National Insurance Company of Galveston, Tex., had encouraged its agents to "conceal a form of life insurance in the Medigap policies it was selling." He said that the life insurance was not subject to profit ceilings, which most states have required for Medigap.
A study for Congress by the General Accounting Office listed deficiencies in some existing Medigap policies: "They provide narrow coverage, pay fixed dollar benefit levels without protection against inflation, are conditioned on confinement in a hospital or contracting the specified disease."
 
A 92-Year-Old Woman's Case
 The Senate Committee on aging cited the case of a 92-year-old Riverside, Calif., woman as an example of misleading sales pitches. The committee said an agent had persuaded the woman, whom it did identify, to buy eight policies, including three from Standard Life. But when she needed assistance with walking and other care at home, the committee said the insurance agent told her that the policy would not pay for the kind of help she needed. "I can't understand why he didn't know that when he sold me the policy," she told the committee.
Under the new law, the 50 state insurance Commissioners would have nine months to draft 10 model Medigap policies. "Every insurer would have to offer a core package of standardized benefits," said Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and a sponsor of the legislation.
The bill would also authorize $10 million to encourage states to establish networks of elderly volunteers to provide free counseling on Medicare issues. Bonnie Burns, a Medicare specialist with California's Health Insurance and Advocacy Program, HICAP, said counselors had helped to assemble the facts in civil damage lawsuits against Medigap insurance salespeople. She said that in one case the Bedrossian Insurance Agency Inc., based in San Jose, agreed last year to pay $200,000 in damages and court costs.
 
Review Is Scheduled
 Carole Olson Gates, a staff lawyer with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said state officials and private insurers would review the new regulations on Tuesday in Chicago. She said that the associaiton had been discussing Medigap standards since March.
Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, an insurers group in Washington, said the bill was "a good compromise" because it would would give the initial responsibility to the states, "with Federal regulation down the road, if they do not act."
Consumer advocates welcomed the Congressional action. Gail Shearer, a Washington policy analyst with Consumers Union, an advocacy group, said the law would "help people who turn 65 and are faced with very confusing choices among hundreds of Medigap policies."
James P. Firman, president of the United Seniors Health Cooperative, an advocacy group in Washington, said insurers would have to ask prospective customers whether they already had Medigap policies.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 1990, Monday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about new Federal standards for health insurance for the elderly referred incorrectly in some editions to the timing of Congress's repeal of the law that expanded Medicare coverage for catastrophic illnesses. It was repealed in November 1989, not this year.

HEADLINE: Taunts but 'Good Money' for New Drivers at News

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Obscenities, eggs and coffee cups bombarded a convoy of nine delivery trucks that roared past a phalanx of police officers in helmets and angry picketers early yesterday morning to deliver bundled copies of The Daily News.
Scores of strikers had gathered outside the paper's printing plant in Brooklyn, taunting the workers who had replaced them with cries of "Scab!" and "Mutt!" and worse as the paper tried to put out its Sunday issue. The war of nerves resumed whenever the police at the printing plant moved barricades to allow vehicles to enter or leave. 
 "Open up the pearly gates!" a striker shouted.
Since the strike began at The Daily News on Thursday night, delivery trucks have been firebombed or battered by bricks, buses carrying replacement workers have been ambushed by men in ski masks wielding bats, and several strikers have been arrested for carrying guns.
 
'It's Good Money'
 None of the drivers had been seriously injured, but each truck still carried a security guard as it left the plant early yesterday. As the convoy rumbled down Atlantic Avenue, the replacement drivers stared straight ahead.
"It's scary," said one replacement driver as he dropped off papers in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. "But we're doing it for the same reason the union guys were doing it. It's good money and a good paper."
Some of the striking workers would agree with that. Many of them, who joined the paper when jobs in newspaper production were handed down like family legacies, speak of The News with a sort of love, though animosity often creeps into their speech. [Page B5]
The replacement driver is among the hundreds of people who responded last spring to advertisements for replacement workers at The Daily News. The applicants included many women and minorities, and those who were selected as delivery truck drivers and pressmen were trained earlier this year. They have been joined at their jobs since the strike began by nonunion workers from other newspapers owned by the Tribune Company, which owns The Daily News.
The driver, a lean young Puerto Rican with a baseball cap, looked warily at strangers and cast quick glances at the security guard who sat in the truck. The driver declined to identify himself or say how much he was being paid, but he said he was outraged at the strikers' attacks and resented the taunts that he thought portrayed the replacement workers as subhuman.
"They're the animals -- they've taken shots at us," he said. "What kind of animal deals like that?"
Before he was called by The Daily News, he was unemployed for six months after losing his job as a quality control engineer. Now, he said, he is on call constantly, although he manages to sleep at home, unlike some other replacement workers hired from out of town who are staying in hotels or sleeping overnight at the newspaper's production plants.
Seated inside the truck's cab with one foot dangling outside, he glanced at the web-like cracks in the windshield, the result of a rock tossed earlier in the week. Although he has escaped injury, he said his relatives are frightened for his safety, and he calls them regularly during the day to assure them he has made it through the night unscathed.
 
Fellowship Among Replacements
 He spoke of the camaraderie that has developed among the replacement drivers. "We got a great bunch of guys who are intelligent and decent enough to work together," he said, pausing with his arms spread wide for emphasis. "The union says they don't want to be bothered, so let them."
He said he did not feel any personal animosity toward the striking workers, saying the unions' complaints should be with management, not with the replacement workers who were just trying to earn a living. But he criticized the unions for their intransigence, saying they have doomed the paper to failure.
"Not all the drivers are bad guys," he said "But they're just killing the goose that lays the golden eggs."
As he sat parked outside a news dealer's storefront in Bensonhurst, several police officers stood nearby, watching a dozen workers tossing newspapers into vans. Other men trotted briskly down the street carrying bundles of papers on their shoulders to waiting cars. Four private security guards hired by The News sat in two cars, each of which had a video camera to record any unusual incidents.
 
Line of Police Cars
 Unlike on Friday night, when police cars escorted the delivery trucks out of the Brooklyn complex and into the streets for about half a mile, the trucks delivering the Sunday paper left in a close convoy without the police, although a line of eight squad cars sat parked along Atlantic Avenue, ready to respond if anyone stepped out of the darkness to attack the trucks.
About a mile down Flatbush Avenue, a dispatcher waved rental cars out of a restaurant parking lot. They carried plainclothed private security guards who would escort the trucks on their rounds. A few of the trucks made sudden turns, sometimes running through red lights.
The trucks assigned to Bensonhurst raced down the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, their security escorts following close behind.
"There's been nothing serious," said one security guard in a leather jacket, who declined to identify himself but whose thick drawl betrayed his Southern roots. He said he was a veteran of providing security to strikebound companies, especially in the coal industry, where strikes have been marked with violent clashes.
"This is mild," he said, as he squeezed his ample girth behind the steering wheel of his compact car. "There's less gunfire." Did he carry a gun underneath his fringed leather jacket? He stared straight ahead at the men unloading the trucks and said with a faint smile, "I take the Fifth."
There was no trouble, and the unloading in Bensonhurst went quickly.
As the returning trucks approached the plant's entrance, a half-dozen picketers perked up, and began their chorus. "Go ahead, you mutt!" the strikers screamed, their taunts eventually fading until the next truck arrived.

Who's Singing the Blues? Just About Anyone Who Wants To

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
Two strange things happened at the Benson & Hedges Blues series in New York City several weeks ago. The first was the arrival of the standing ovation based on reputation, something not generally seen at blues shows. The second was that the festival featured much music only tangentially related to blues as a style; everything from gospel-based soul to rock-and-roll to rhythm-and-blues made an appearance.
The incessant standing ovations hinted at the increased popularity of blues music in the United States and the hagiography that has accompanied it. And in the diverse grouping of musical styles collected under the term blues, it was clear that the word has become synonymous with older styles of black music. 
 At the highest economic level, performers lumped under the label blues seem to be doing fairly well: their status as classics occasionally works in their favor. A Benson & Hedges bill featuring the soul singer Irma Thomas, the blues singer Koko Taylor, the rhythm-and-blues singer Ruth Brown and the soul singer Etta James sold out Avery Fisher Hall; 10 years ago the show wouldn't have been put on, and if it had been, it wouldn't have sold out.
Still, the performers working the blues circuit -- usually clubs, and not concert halls -- are often refugees. Playing exclusively to white audiences open-minded enough to listen to older music and recording on small budgets, these older black musicians have been left behind by the black pop-music industry and have found a haven in a new, younger and whiter audience.
 Consider this contrast. While older white performers like Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Steve Winwood, the Rolling Stones and Robert Plant are still guaranteed access to radio and arena-size audiences and are not sold as elder statesmen, older black popular performers are shut out of the pop process and relegated to blues shows in which they are viewed as legends instead of performers.
The increased popularity of blues and the use of the term blues to cover older forms of black music are related. Until the rise of hip-hop, black music, often derived from the gospel church, displayed a mastery of the rhetorical tools of passion. In addition, the amplified guitar-based blues tradition, as exemplified by Chicago and Texas blues, often favors exaggeration and excess, both lyrically and sonically, creating raw, loud and tough music.
In the 1950's, those elements were immediately picked up by white youth and translated into rock-and-roll, in which the cult of primitivism still reigns. Expressionism is the foundation of rock-and-roll: raw, loud and tough are words of praise.
But current popular music, with its lip-synching, dance routines and programmed music, is anything but raw, and audiences looking for all the signs of passion that music was supposed to deliver have been forced to search elsewhere. They find it in heavy metal, in hip-hop to a certain extent and in older black music. The rock-and-roll impulse, with all its elements of passion and hints of transcendence, originally a blues impulse, is now being found by white audiences in older forms of black music.
The new interest in blues, and in standing ovations, comes from the periodic re-emergence of values based on the idea of authenticity. Studio recordings by pop acts are often hard to reproduce onstage, and the acts are perceived as artificial.
But older black music, with its emphasis on live performances and improvisation, is perceived as authentic. The doubts that the pop group Milli Vanilli even performs on its own records and its lip-synching in live performance has its opposite in the standing ovation for Albert Collins, whose guitar improvisations boil to the point of anarchy. Though Mr. Collins's two shows at the Beacon Theater weren't well arranged, everything he played had a driving intensity, where knifelike phrases cut through his band; his improvisations thrilled the audience.
So the audience's appreciation of Mr. Collins comes both as an appreciation of his standing in American music, a perhaps premature feeling that he, at age 58, has reached classic status. And improvisation guarantees a visceral excitement not often found in pop music; it's no accident that like blues, jazz has become dramatically more popular in the last 10 years. To hear Miss James, for example, take a song and radically rewrite it on the spot, improvising swooping arabesques, only to take a gospel shout and land it between melody notes, is a thrilling experience. Whether she actually feels the passion is irrelevant: she knows how, like any good actor, to make an audience believe. And her improvisations can charge an audience with the brazenness of their imagination.
But at its worst, the hunger for authenticity allows the performers and audiences to fall into stereotypes, in which the audience expects the performers to behave a certain way, and the performers are more than glad to accommodate their expectations. That comes in Ms. Taylor's endless claims that she and the audience were "going to the basement" to get the blues, as if she had the secret to the real thing. The audience's willingness to be suckered by the most obvious of ploys implies a hunger for an emotional authenticity perceived as being an attribute of working-class black culture. And it shows in the artificiality of the good-time image many performers radiate or in the calculated primitivism of Bo Diddley.
Where the festival atmosphere promotes blues hagiography, there is another reality. That's the reality of the small blues clubs, where blues is often purely functional, a backdrop to a Saturday night party. At places like Manny's Carwash on the Upper East Side or Mondo Cane in Greenwich Village, weekend shows are packed regardless of who is performing.
The veteran traveling bands that work those clubs breeze in, run though several sets of Saturday night cliches to which the audience, intent on other diversions, doesn't always pay attention, and then they're off to the next city. There are no standing ovations, the dressing rooms are small, and the pay is not commensurate with their abilities. But it's work, just as loaded with the mythic and social implications of bigger shows.
 And though the bands, whether they be the Holmes Brothers or Phillip Walker, are lesser known than, say, Miss James or Mr. Collins, they supply the necessary intensity, the necessary crunch that audiences desire. For the time being, the blues, whether its performers are on the big stage or in a small club, famous or barely known, is playing a larger role in the American racial puzzle.

HEADLINE: Major Immigration Bill Is Sent to Bush

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Congress has passed a major immigration bill that would increase legal permanent immigration to the United States by more than 35 percent, and White House officials said today that President Bush was eager to sign the measure.
The most notable feature of the bill is that it requires the State Department to admit more immigrants with job skills needed in the United States, a step long favored by free-market economists. 
 The number of visas granted on the basis of job skills, to workers and their relatives, would more than double, to 140,000 a year from 54,000.
But the increase implies no reduction in the number of immigrants admitted on the basis of family relationships. The number of such "family-sponsored immigrants," now 436,000 a year, would increase to 465,000 a year through Sept. 30, 1994, and would then rise to 480,000.
 
Section Defeated by Hispanics
 Under the bill, total immigration to the United States would initially increase 40 percent, to 700,000 from the current level of about 500,000. The ceiling would drop to 675,000 in 1995.
Those figures do not include refugees, who are admitted to the United States after showing "a well-founded fear of persecution" in their homelands. Mr. Bush has authorized the admission of up to 131,000 refugees in the current fiscal year, up from 125,000 last year.
The landmark immigration bill was passed late Saturday, a few hours before the 101st Congress ended. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus staged a brief revolt and forced the bill's sponsors to remove a section permitting several states to test more secure means of identification. Hispanic-American groups generally oppose the idea of a national identification card and resist any step that might lead to such a document.
Representative Bruce A. Morrison, Democrat of Connecticut, chief sponsor of the legislation in the House, said that Republicans who wanted to test the use of more secure identification documents quickly agreed to drop that section of the bill.
 
Worker Shortages Expected
 After complaining about an earlier version of the bill, which would have allowed higher immigration levels, the White House threw its support behind the legislation in the last few weeks.
The President's top domestic policy adviser, Roger B. Porter, said the Administration "strongly supports" the compromise measure because it would help relieve labor shortages and would contribute to economic growth in the 1990's.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said: "Numerous studies suggest that the long-run benefits of immigration greatly exceed any short-run costs. With projections of a rising demand for skilled workers in coming years, the nation can achieve even greater benefits from immigration by augmenting the traditional emphasis on family reunification with policies designed to increase the number of skilled immigrants."
Lawmakers said immigrants could, for example, fill job openings for scientists, engineers, computer specialists, nurses and medical technicians. Many Government and private researchers have concluded that there will be labor shortages in such areas in the 1990's. They see immigration -- the admission of permanent immigrants, not temporary workers -- as a way to correct the mismatch between labor supply and demand.
 
Two Groups Singled Out
 Hispanic groups support a section of the bill that provides 55,000 visas in each of the next three years for spouses and children of aliens who gained legal status under a 1986 law.
Another part of the bill, strongly supported by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, would make available up to 16,000 visas in each of the next three years for Irish citizens.
Some critics, including Doris M. Meissner, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, say such provisions are reminiscent of "national origins" quotas that discriminated in favor of white Europeans. But Mr. Kennedy said the provisions were justified to increase the diversity of immigration.
"We are trying to level the playing field," Mr. Kennedy said, noting that eight countries now receive 52 percent of all immigrant visas.
 
Influence of Immigrants
 Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean now account for most legal immigration to the United States. Europe, which dominated such immigration from colonial times to the 1950's, now accounts for a small share of the total.
The selection criteria are important because immigration is expected to account for a growing proportion of the United States' population growth in the next two decades. The Census Bureau says that the proportion, now 27 percent, would rise to 35 percent by the year 2005 if current trends continue.
The House approved the immigration bill by a vote of 264 to 118. The margin in the Senate was 89 to 8.
The bill ranks in importance with the Quota Act of 1921, which established the first numerical restrictions on immigration, and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the McCarran-Walter Act, which listed dozens of ideological and other reasons for excluding aliens. The new measure was described by its sponsors as a logical companion to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which outlawed the hiring of illegal aliens, but made only a few small changes in legal immigration.
 
Salvadorans Protected
 Representative E. (Kika) de la Garza, Democrat of Texas, said he voted against the 1986 measure, but for the bill on Saturday. "It's as good a bill as we could have had," he said today in an interview.
Under the bill, Salvadorans already in the United States could stay in a "special temporary protected status" through June 30, 1992, after which the Attorney General could extend their stay. They would have to register with the Federal Government. Salvadorans and their advocates have long argued that it was unsafe for Salvadorans to return home because of the civil war in their country.
The bill also gives the Attorney General explicit new authority to offer a "temporary protected status" to certain aliens from countries where there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic or "other environmental disaster."

HEADLINE: CONGRESS ADJOURNS;
Final Votes in Congress on Key Measures

 BODY:

Crime
 Both the House and the Senate approved an anti-crime bill after negotiators removed death penalty provisions and curbs on semiautomatic assault weapons in an effort to make the bill more widely acceptable. Liberals had generally opposed the death penalty and conservatives opposed the gun curbs. The vote in the House was 313 to 1, with Representative George W. Gekas, Republican of Pennsylvania, opposing the measure. Other provisions address victim rights, juvenile justice and prisoner drug testing.
 
 National Endowment for the Arts
The House and Senate extended financing for the National Endowment for the Arts for three years after negotiators from both chambers reached agreement Friday night. Unlike current law, the bill includes no explicit prohibition against financing obscene art, leaving such judgments to the courts. The negotiators also dropped a proposed ban on support of artistic works that denigrate religion.
 
 Foreign Aid
Both houses passed a $15.5 billion foreign aid bill. It includes a provision sought by President Bush to forgive $6.7 billion of Egypt's military debt. The bill would also cut military aid to El Salvador by half, to $42 million, and provide Israel with $3 billion in cash, military and economic aid and $700 million worth of military aid from American stockpiles. The bill does not specify an amount of aid for Pakistan, normally the third-largest recipient of American military assistance. The United States has expressed concerns about nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
 
 Airport Noise
Congress instructed the Federal Aviation Administration to eliminate most of the airlines' noisier jets by the turn of the century. The action will also allow local governments to impose fees on passengers and to use the money for airport improvement.
 
 Offshore Oil
Congress agreed to keep vast tracts of coastal waters from Alaska to New England off limits to oil and gas drilling, rejecting arguments that domestic fuel production should be increased because of the crisis in the Middle East.
 
Appropriations
Congress passed all 13 of the bills that are needed each year to actually provide the money for Government activities. The 13 bills are: Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies; Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary; Defense; District of Columbia; Energy and Water Development; Foreign Operations; Interior and Related Agencies; Labor, Health and Human Services, Education; Legislative Branch; Military Construction; Transportation and Related Agencies; Treasury, Postal Service, General Government; Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, Independent Agencies.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Decline 4.6%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools dipped 4.6 percent in September, from August's rate, according to an industry report to be released today. The decline is the second in as many months.
The report, which is being released by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a trade association for the machine tool industry, stated that machine tool orders fell to $264.2 million in September, from $276.8 million in August. The September figures represented a 12.7 percent decline from September 1989. 
 Despite the decline, executives of machine tool companies said there were some bright spots.
"There have been some healthy gains in new orders from the auto companies domestically and from foreign customers," said Richard O. Priebe, a spokesman for the Cross & Trecker Corporation, a leading machine tool maker, based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. "In September, we had a strong month because of a couple of automotive orders: an assembly system and an engine block line."
Automobile makers typically account for more than a third of the nation's machine tool orders. Sluggishness in that industry has caused machine tool orders to slow in several months this year.
 
Domestic Orders Fall
 Machine tool orders from domestic customers fell 9.1 percent in September, the report stated. Analysts said that figure pointed to the unwilingness of American companies to invest more robustly in new equipment and modernization at a time when corporate profits have been weakened.
"The figures make it clear that industry still needs a tremendous amount of modernization," said James J. Paper, an analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith Inc., in Omaha. "There is a global reindustrialization that needs to take place."
Orders from foreign customers increased by 66.4 percent in September. Mr. Paper said the increase was more likely a result of a one-time placement of large orders by a foreign customer than a harbinger of increased sales from overseas machine tool buyers.
Orders from foreign customers, he and other analysts pointed out, declined 2.7 percent in August from July's level.
 
'Globally Competitive'
 Albert W. Moore, president of the industry association, said the increase in orders from foreign customers served as "a good indication that America's machine tool builders are globally competetive."
"The need for process technology is growing, and so is the competition to fill that need," he said.
Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in products ranging from appliances and vehicles to aircraft and construction materials.
The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production, and economists consider patterns of machine tool sales to be important indicators of capital spending by manufacturers.
Shipments of machine tools increased 29 percent in September, compared with August's rate. While shipments to foreign customers were up 6.1 percent, shipments to domestic customers increased 33.1 percent in September, from the previous month's level.
Orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, dropped 8.6 percent in September from August's level. That segment of the industry typically accounts for three-fourths of new orders. Orders for metal-forming tools increased 14.4 percent, helped by a surge in foreign orders.
The machine tool order backlog in September stood at $1.57 billion, down from August's $1.61 billion.

No Talks on Hostages, European Leaders Vow

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Oct. 28

 BODY:
European Community leaders said today that Iraq's selective release of foreign hostages would not erode their unity in the Persian Gulf crisis, and they pledged not to negotiate with Baghdad to bring their countrymen home.
The 12 Western European leaders also seemed to hold out the possibility of eventual military action, saying they were "prepared to consider additional steps" within a United Nations framework if the present economic embargo does not force Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. 
 But Italy's Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti, who holds the community's rotating presidency, said, "Anyone with his head set properly on his shoulders agrees that military means should be only the final recourse."
On economic matters, 11 of the leaders decided o leave Britain behind by setting a timetable to achieve a single European currency in this decade. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told a television interviewer that the others were in "cloud-cuckoo-land," but they decided not to be deterred and simply noted her dissent in their statement.
 
Bush Urges Cohesion
 Before the leaders convened here this weekend for two rounds of talks, Italy had expressed concern that Western solidarity could be chipped away by President Saddam Hussein's offers to release selected groups of foreigners being held as "human shields" at strategic Iraqi locations. An Italian Government spokesman disclosed Saturday evening that President Bush had telephoned Mr. Andreotti to make a similar point and to urge "strong cohesion" among the Europeans.
The worried statements were issued after a week in which Iraq promised to free all 327 French hostages and allowed 33 Britons to fly home with former Prime Minister Edward Heath of Britain, who had led a private mission to Baghdad. Iraq continues to hold many hundreds of others, including an estimated 1,000 Americans.
French officials insist that in regard to the hostages Baghdad acted on its own, and President Francois Mitterrand said at a news conference here today that there was "no contact with Iraq, no delegation, no emissary" from France.
But to leave no doubt that they remain united, the community members issued a statement on the Middle East that contained nothing to suggest, as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev did in Spain on Saturday, that Iraq might be softening its position.
Referring to the hostages, the leaders said they "denounce the unscrupulous use which Iraq is making of them with the sole and vain purpose of trying to divide the international community," adding, "They affirm their determination not to send representatives of their governments in any capacity to negotiate with Iraq the release of foreign hostages and to discourage others from doing so."
 
'A Very Powerful Signal'
 After the meeting, Mrs. Thatcher said, "The unity of the 12 nations on this matter is a very powerful signal to Iraq."
At the same time, the European leaders warned Israel that the present situation in the West Bank and other occupied zones was "unsustainable," and they repeated a call for an international peace conference to take up the Arab-Israeli conflict. But they refused to link this issue with the Persian Gulf crisis. Mr. Andreotti, a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, insisted that Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait remained the top priority.
While the Italian leader pronounced this weekend's results to be "excellent," the moves toward political and economic unity were as bumpy as ever, with Mrs. Thatcher once again making her displeasure plain.
She described plans for revamping European Community institutions as "a ragbag of proposals," and said she would never agree to a monetary plan that threatened the survival of the pound. "We will not have a single currency imposed upon us," she said at a news conference. "A common currency, yes, but a single currency, no."
 
Farm-Subsidy Cuts Argued
 Mr. Thatcher was similarly upset by the inability of community negotiators on Friday to agree on a program of farm-subsidy reductions that are to be put before the so-called Uruguay Round trade talks in December. Britain blamed France and Germany for blocking an accord, and rather than risk an open fight at the summit, Mr. Andreotti shifted discussions to a lower-level meeting this week.
On the monetary issue, 11 of the leaders agreed that starting Jan. 1, 1994, a year after their scheduled economic integration, they would move toward a central banking system with "full responsibility for monetary policy." That would pave the way for fixed exchange rates and a single currency that Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, said was needed before the year 2000.
But Mrs. Thatcher, insisting that target dates should await the ironing out of all other details, told the British Broadcasting Corporation that "it seems to me cloud-cuckoo-land" to proceed as the others did today.

U.S. Boards Iraqi Tanker That Ignored Shots

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 28

 BODY:
United States marines boarded and searched an Iraqi tanker in the northern Arabian Sea today after it ignored warning shots fired by warships and low-level passes by American fighter jets.
The marines, from the amphibious transport ship Ogden, met no resistance from the Iraqi crew when they boarded the ship to check for possible violations of trade sanctions imposed by the United Nations against Iraq. 
 The ship, which was heading for Iraq, was allowed to proceed after no prohibited cargo was found on board, a United States Navy spokesman in the Persian Gulf said.
The spokesman said the Marines descended to the deck of the 157,000-ton tanker Amuriyah from helicopters.
Later, a Navy spokesman in Saudi Arabia, Comdr. J. D. Van Sickle, said the Australian guided missile frigate Darwin fired 200 rounds from its .50-caliber machine guns and the American frigate Reasoner fired two rounds from its five-inch guns during the interception.

Small Drop In Rates Predicted

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board will probably respond to the passage of the new Federal budget by reducing short-term interest rates, but credit market analysts said neither Congress nor the Bush Administration should expect a substantial reduction as a glittering prize for what the tortuous, confidence-shaking exercise has produced.
"The new budget is a step, but I don't think fiscal discipline has been re-established at all," said William H. Gross, a managing director of the Pacific Investment Management Company, a Newport Beach, Calif., money management firm with a portfolio of more than $16 billion in fixed-income investments. "Unless we can exert some discipline on spending, rather than taxation, we are probably not going to make much headway in reducing the deficit."

 As is their wont, neither the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, nor other officials of the nation's central bank would speak on or off the record about their intentions on interest rates. Telephone calls to Mr. Greenspan and governors of the Federal Reserve on Friday found no one who would comment on Federal Reserve policies and how the budget agreement might affect them.
But through the summer and into the fall, Mr. Greenspan had offered Congress a carrot -- a drop in short-term interest rates -- if the credit markets responded positively to a budget package.
The message struck a chord with market participants, and in the last week short-term money market interest rates moved down in anticipation of a budget agreement and a subsequent reduction in the overnight Federal funds rate, the market rate controlled most directly by the Fed. The funds rate -- the overnight rate on bank loans-- has hovered around 8 percent since July.
 
 Drop in Prime Rate Unlikely
 While welcome, a minor cut in the funds rate would probably not lead to a decline in the prime lending rate charged by commercial banks, or in other prime-based consumer borrowing rates. With poor balance sheets, analysts said, commercial banks were not likely to consider lowering the prime rate, currently at 10 percent, until the funds rate fell to 7 1/2 percent.
Yet, even as short-term rates slipped, bond yields, which are the ultimate indicator of how a long-term budget package is judged by market participants, have not budged.
By the end of last week, yields on 8 1/8 percent two-year Treasury notes, securities which are very sensitive to changes in Fed policy, had fallen to 7.76 percent, well under the funds rate. But yields on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds were stuck at 8.76 percent.
"The Fed might be able to cut the Federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percentage point without upsetting the market," said Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "But people who think there will be a big payoff on interest rates based on this budget package are in for a disappointment."
The Fed will be reluctant to move faster because market participants, especially long-term investors, see little reason to believe the budget package will generate the advertised $500 billion in savings over the next five years.
Moreover, with the dollar under pressure and fears about inflation still strong, the Fed would be running a substantial risk of pushing up long-term rates if it quickly cut short-term rates by more than a quarter of a percentage point, the analysts argued.
 
 Economic Reports Awaited
 A signal from the Fed that it has moved the funds rate lower may come almost immediately, but in order to calm nerves in the long-term bond market, analysts said, the Fed might well delay its move until after a string of important economic reports are released this week.
Those reports, coupled with the announcement late last week that a key measure of consumer confidence had plummeted in October, are likely to reassure bond investors that an easing of Fed policy is justified on economic grounds.
This week will provide a preliminary reading on how the economy fared in the third quarter and reports from the naton's purchasing managers and the Labor Department on how the fourth quarter began.
 
 Rise in Consumption Spending
 The Commerce Department's preliminary report on third-quarter growth could well show growth that is considerably above the increase of four-tenths of a percent recorded in the second quarter. But most analysts said a rise in third-quarter output should not be interpreted as a sign that the economy was regaining momentum. Much of the increase will probably be from a rise in consumption expenditures, a figure that tends to increase in the third quarter.
"I would hope people will look past the consumption number in the third quarter G.N.P. report," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "Consumption was stronger than it was in the second quarter, but on a year-over-year basis it continues to weaken."
Dimming the outlook for the fourth quarter was the announcement late last week of a record drop in the Conference Board's monthly survey of consumer confidence, which in October fell to its lowest level since the 1982 recession.
Gayle Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board and an analyst who says the economy will avoid a recession, acknowledged that the results of the survey were troubling. "I would now be inclined to reduce my estimates on consumer spending somewhat," she said, "but I think this number has more to do with disenchantment over the budget negotiations than with economics."
 
 Manufacturers and Jobs
 Other analysts are not so sure. A report, due Thursday, from the nation's purchasing managers, will probably show that conditions among large manufacturers deteriorated further in October. October employment data from the Labor Department, expected the following day, will probably be weak, too.
"The data will show that the fourth quarter started off on a very weak note," Mr. Fine said. "I have no problem with a forecast which shows economic output declining in the fourth quarter."
Mr. Jordan of First Interstate said that weakness in the economy would ultimately lead to an aggressive easing in policy by the Federal Reserve. But constraints on the Fed will not be lifted until the crisis in the Middle East is resolved, he added, and the dollar regains some bouyancy.
"If they were not constrained by the Middle East crisis, the Fed would have already done more to help the economy," he said. "Assuming there is a solution, we think the funds rate will come down to 7 percent next year."

Communist Paper in U.S. Feels Capitalist Pressure

 BODY:
The People's Daily World, the American Communist newspaper whose legacy extends back to the 1920's, is trying to revive its sagging fortunes with some decidedly capitalist initiatives: aggressive marketing and prudent cost-cutting.
After years of incurring heavy debts, which were only erased through fund raising, the newspaper's management in June reduced its publication schedule from four issues a week to one and began a campaign to increase circulation. To reflect the changes, the newspaper early this month was renamed The People's Weekly World. 
 Barry Cohen, The World's top editor, is quick to point out that the newspaper's troubles are not related to the decline of Communism around the world. Instead, he said, The World is responding to the same pressures that are threatening many small newspapers and magazines in the United States.
 
 Circulation of 62,000
 Although The World says its circulation has remained stable in recent years, at about 62,000 copies a week, its costs have continued to rise.
To raise revenues, The World's management recently doubled the newspaper's cover price to 50 cents. But unlike other publications, The World would benefit little from raising advertising rates. In a recent 28-page issue, for example, there was only a half-page of advertising, mostly for left-wing booksellers.
"The economics of publishing are not very favorable to the little guy," said Mr. Cohen, who is a member of the committee of editors and business managers that runs the newspaper.
"Costs are going up all around," he said. "We are basically a reader-supported newspaper, so the difficulties of raising money for those costs are quite great. It just was a more sensible strategy for us to concentrate our resources on the once-a-week paper."
The changes come for a publication with a rich history dating back to the founding in 1924 of The Daily Worker, which for decades was the voice of the radical left in the United States.
The Daily Worker became a weekly in the 1950's. After a series of name changes and mergers, The People's Daily World was founded in 1986.
 
 An Advocacy Journal
 Closely allied to the Communist Party of the United States of America but not officially linked to it, The World bills itself as an advocacy journal for the working class and its coverage emphasizes labor issues.
The newspaper, which is based in New York and has correspondents around the country and in London, Moscow and Havana, also reports on general news with a left-wing slant.
The World receives praise from some union leaders who, though they may not subscribe to its Communist philosophy, appreciate its reporting on labor issues.
"It's the best coverage in the country," said Marshall Garcia, the executive vice president of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union in New York.
Mr. Garcia said he had been particularly impressed with The World's coverage of the bitter Pittston coal miners strike, which was settled early this year.
Mr. Cohen said that as a weekly, the newspaper will be able to rely less on reader-supported fund-raising campaigns, which in the past have covered nearly half its budget of slightly more than $1 million.
The People's Weekly World usually runs about 28 tabloid pages and includes more in-depth pieces than the daily paper did. The newspaper also features editorials, opinion pieces and a three-page section in Spanish.
 
 Aggressive Marketing
 Besides cutting costs, The World's management is marketing the publication more aggressively by retaining a distributor, which is placing 7,000 copies of the newspaper on New York City newsstands.
The newspaper is also sold at labor rallies and political meetings. Subscriptions cost $15 a year, although students, the elderly and unemployed people pay $7 a year.
As part of its search for additional revenues, the newspaper is seeking advertisements from unions and left-wing organizations and from publishers selling books that might interest a left-wing readership.
Joy Brock, The World's managing editor, said the move to a weekly had progressed smoothly, though she acknowledged that some readers were disappointed by the change.
"The real loss is that we are not able to reflect the breadth of activity that we once were," Ms. Brock said. "That can give people the feeling that less is going on."
 
 Editor Is Optimistic
 Despite The World's problems and the worldwide entrenchment of Communism, Mr. Cohen, a lifelong Communist who is 40 years old, said he was optimistic about the future of the newspaper.
He said he was looking forward to using The People's Weekly World to present the virtues of Communism to a public freed of many of the ideological constraints of the Cold War.
"Our experience is that the interest in socialism is greater, perhaps, than it's ever been in our country," he said. "When you look at the problems of this system, how could you not be curious about whether there is an alternative which would be better?"

HEADLINE: Campaign Trail;
Gains Seen for Women, but Not Without Fights

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
This was billed as the year of the woman in politics, but nobody ever said it would be easy.
Women are now locked in tough, close races for governor in Texas, California, Oregon, Kansas and Alaska. Gov. Kay A. Orr of Nebraska, the only female incumbent running for re-election this year, is in a tight race, while women challenging incumbents in Pennsylvania and Wyoming are in uphill battles.. 
 "We could have everything from a terrific victory to a terrific defeat on election night," said Sharon Rodine, president of the National Women's Political Caucus.
Currently there are three female governors, and two of them, Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont and Rose Mofford of Arizona, are not seeking re-election.
There is a strong possibility that the women's caucus in the Senate will increase by 50 percent, from two to three. Representative Patricia Saiki, Republican of Hawaii, is in a very close race against Senator Daniel Akaka. But two other Republican women from the House, Representatives Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island and Lynn Martin of Illinois, are running behind in their campaigns for the Senate. Josie Heath, a Democrat running for the open Senate seat in Colorado, is also behind Representative Hank Brown.
Voters are likely to send some new women to the House this year, but since five women are leaving (three to run for Senate, two to retire), neither party's Congressional campaign committee expects much of a big net gain in the number of female House members. Right now, there are 29 women in the 435-member House.
Groups like Emily's List, a fund-raising network for Democratic women who support abortion rights, are looking to the reapportionment year of 1992 to make significant gains in the House. Wendy Sherman, executive director of Emily's List, is already making recruiting trips into Florida and other states where House seats will be added in 1992, trying to line up women who are interested in running.
Some analysts had predicted that this year was particularly auspicious for women because the issues that were hot -- the environment, education, abortion rights -- were issues that voters often associate with women. But the agenda this fall has been dominated by the economy and the crisis in the Persian Gulf. "It came back to more macho issues, as opposed to the more domestic issues that women have articulated well," Ms. Rodine said.
Still, Ms. Rodine and others say that women have been holding their own on some tough playing fields, particularly in California, where Dianne Feinstein's race against Senator Pete Wilson seems almost deadlocked, and in Texas, where Ann Richards has confounded those who were writing her off just a few weeks ago and is now in a close contest with Clayton Williams.
Moreover, the number of women running for state offices, including lieutenant governor and state treasurer, continues to grow. "Most of them are running for high office after years of working their way up the political ladder," said a recent report by Ruth B. Mandel, director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers.
But Ann Lewis, a Democratic strategist, says there are still signs of a glass ceiling restricting the upward progress of women seeking the highest offices. Part of it, she argues, is the ability to break into the fund-raising circles that are critical for major statewide races like governor.
Wendy Sherman says, "Win or lose, the political landscape has changed for Democratic women."
Women's groups are accustomed to claiming psychological and symbolic victories after losing elections, but on Nov. 6 they would also like to see women claim some real power.
 
Comic Strip Satire And Helms Reality
 Doug Marlette's comic strip "Kudzu" often explores the clash between old values and modern life in the changing South, as represented by the mythical town of Bypass, N.C. Now, he is offering the view from Bypass of Senator Jesse Helms's campaign for re-election. But this is a subject of sensitivity in the real North Carolina.
Mr. Marlette, a native of the state who now works in New York for Newsday, produced a series of strips lampooning the Senator's struggle to come to grips with the end of the cold war.
"Nobody's out to get me," the Senator tells a psychiatrist in the strip, shortly before solving his problem by announcing a Senate hearing into the International Artistic Conspiracy, as well as a decision by the National Endowment for the Arts to suppress production of black velvet art.
As is often the case in politics, the line between reality and satire can blur. In "Kudzu," a mock Helms commercial attacks his opponent for holding fund-raising events "in places like New York and San Francisco, if you know what I mean." The real-life Helms campaign is using a television commercial saying that the Senator's opponent, Harvey Gantt, "has raised thousands of dollars in gay and lesbian bars in San Francisco, New York and Washington."
Some North Carolina newspapers got edgy. The Raleigh News and Observer suspended the comic strip until it stops lampooning Mr. Helms or until the election, whichever comes first. The Charlotte Observer and The Winston-Salem Journal moved the strip to the opinion pages.
 
Further Costs Seen For the White House
 Some Republicans privately say the White House may regret the blithe attitude toward the 1990 elections that many people detected in its handling of the budget talks. If Republicans lose a dozen seats in the House next week (they now has only 175), and a Senate seat, which many are now predicting, the White House may find the next two years less than pleasant.
One Republican strategist, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, noted that such losses would make it much more difficult to sustain a veto or pass legislation that the Bush Administration wants. It will mean, this strategist argued, that the Administration will have to be more accommodating with George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, and Speaker Thomas S. Foley. And that, in the view of many Republicans, is exactly what is wrong with the Bush Administration today.

HEADLINE: The Bond Act: A Price Worth Paying

 BODY:
The spirits of Teddy Roosevelt, Averell Harriman and Nelson Rockefeller -- conservationists all -- must be restless. New York voters will vote next week on a $1.9 billion bond act to enhance the state's environment. New Yorkers have approved nine such measures in this century but this one is thought to be in trouble. Some critics call it a naked land grab. Others say it's an agreeable but frivolous luxury in a time of fiscal austerity.
It is neither. The act deserves support. But its critics have raised serious questions that deserve serious answers. 
 The act is not well understood. It is not exclusively or even largely a device to shield environmentally sensitive areas from developers. About $800 million is earmarked for the purchase of open and undeveloped land. But the rest -- $1.1 billion -- would be devoted to unglamorous, worthy capital projects that will have to be funded somehow.
There's $500 million for waste management -- closing unsafe municipal landfills and speeding municipal recycling. There's $175 million for sewage treatment, $100 million for an esplanade on New York City's West Side and substantial sums for parks and recreational facilities. The bill may end up funding a few projects of dubious value. But most will enhance the quality of everyday life.
Still, two big questions remain:
Is the act affordable? Two years ago the act would have had little trouble; today's a different story, given the state's fiscal problems. Comptroller Edward Regan, for one, argues that New York has enough debt as it is. But both the Business Council and the bond rating agencies say the ratio between New York's debt service and its tax receipts is within acceptable limits and won't be threatened by the bond act. Nor will the money be raised or spent all at once; the actual sale of bonds can be pegged to economic conditions. And the cost to each New Yorker over the bonds' life is estimated at $7 a year.
Is the $800 million for land acquisition necessary? To some environmentalists, that's the heart of the bill, its chief legacy to future generations. But some critics, including angry Adirondackers, fear that state purchases of open space will threaten their livelihoods and freedom. Others argue that New York's open space is not now in jeopardy, since the housing market is weak.
Three points. One: Open space money will be distribted statewide; only part, still undetermined, would be used to enlarge the Adirondack forest preserve. The rest would be used for projects like protecting underground drinking water supplies in crowded suburban areas like Long Island, or shielding the Catskills reservoirs from development.
Two: No land will be "seized." The funds would simply give authorities the ability to compete with developers by offering private landowners fair market value -- and then only after consultation with local residents. Three: Even if development is not a threat now, it could well be tomorrow.
This act is worthy of resounding support. And those who had planned to vote for it should urge their friends to join them.

HEADLINE: New York Needs the Environmental Bond Act

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As you suggest in an Oct. 18 news article, many residents of New York State are undecided about the merits of the proposed 21st Century Environmental Quality Bond Act, which will be on the ballot Nov. 6.
Is it wise to authorize the state to incur long-term debt in these times of economic uncertainty? On the surface, the answer to this question would seem to be no. But the facts tell another story.
Failure to pass the bond act would result in the loss of at least $700 million in Federal grants. This would break the fiscal backs of local communities now struggling to deal with polluting waste-water systems.
In testimony before a State Assembly committee this week, representatives of key local government associations estimated that dealing with the solid-waste crisis alone would cost local taxpayers billions.
Revenues from the environmental bond act may seem like a drop in the bucket compared with these costs. But over the next 10 years, this investment will pump, it has been estimated, $11.7 billion into the economy of New York State.
And we can finance the debt for 2 cents a day per citizen.
To paraphrase Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the next decade will determine the fate of New York's landscape. Without the necessary funds, state government will stand by helplessly as opportunities to preserve our special places and expand public access come and then are gone.
The bond act's foes have had center stage lately. Now it's time for the voters to have all the facts. New Yorkers need the environmental bond act.

Indy Takes a Worldwide View

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO

 BODY:
JUST as the Disney theme parks have expanded overseas in recent years, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is trying to create a worldwide network of Indy 500's through licensing agreements in Europe and Japan.
The plan could bring back the top international drivers, who haven't run in the Indianapolis 500 since the 1960's, when world champions such as Jim Clark, Graham Hill and Jackie Stewart made the race a true world-class event. 
 But the idea, which could benefit the entire Indy-car series in the United States as well as sharply increase speedway profits, may never escape the dense thicket of international racing politics.
Selling the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's name internationally is by far the most lucrative means for the speedway to increase income. The Indy 500 puts such a strain on local public services that the track cannot run a second event. And the track's seating capacity, 275,000, cannot be expanded much more.
These realities were the genesis of meetings that Tony George, the 30-year-old president of the speedway, and Bill Donaldson, the track's vice president and marketing director, had with officials of racing's international governing body, known as FISA, in March and July.
Simply put, the speedway would allow its name and the name of its race -- registered trademarks -- to be attached to a series of oval-track Indy-car races internationally, with the Indy 500 as part of that series. Along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 500 is one of the world's most famous races, and such a series would tap into the wealthy markets of Japan and a united Europe.
The speedway wouldn't be the only party to gain. FISA's flagship series, the Formula One world championship, isn't very popular in the United States. An international oval-track series, which would use the same engines as Formula One cars, would deliver an American audience to Formula One sponsors.
By adopting the same rules as the new series, Championship Auto Racing Teams, which sanctions the 15 other Indy-car races in the United States and Canada (a separate group runs the Indy 500), would get an international audience for its sponsors and increased participation by auto manufacturers, the lifeblood of any racing series. Next year, Chevrolet and Alfa Romeo will be the only car companies building CART engines. Formula One will have engines from Ford, Honda, Porsche, Ferrari and Renault, with Mercedes-Benz rumored to be interested.
But George's plan is a hostage in a dispute between CART and FISA over CART's plans to run a race in Queensland, Australia, next March. FISA has declared the race illegal, saying its rules prevent a domestic series like CART's from holding races in foreign countries.
The loudest shot in the CART-FISA battle was fired Oct. 10, when FISA's World Council, meeting in Paris, announced plans for an international oval-track series, starting in 1992, with races at as-yet-unbuilt tracks in Japan and Europe and, presumably, the speedway.
Although that announcement made it seem as if George and FISA had come to an agreement -- one that froze out CART -- George said recently that FISA had announced the series without any promises from him to join.
"They haven't mentioned to us one way or another if they would like the speedway to be a part of it," George said a few days after FISA's announcement.
George expressed disappointment in CART and FISA. "Both sides, I think, are not really looking at all the issues," George said. "They are not willing to consider anything beyond their side of the equation."
George was asked if he thought FISA was using the announcement as a public-relations ploy against CART. "Yeah, I think they're notorious for that," he said.
But Bernie Ecclestone, vice president of FISA, said from London that FISA's announcement was not meant as a cudgel against CART. "This was in line with what we talked about in the past," Ecclestone said, alluding to the meetings with George.
"If he just wanted a conversation and didn't want anything to happen, he should have indicated that," Ecclestone said.
As for the CART race in Australia, Ecclestone said that FISA wasn't worried about economic competition. FISA, which last year forced cancellation of a CART event in Japan by threatening Japanese race officials with sanctions, believes that allowing CART to expand overseas would create organizational chaos, he said.
"Who issues the licences? Who do you make appeals to? Who has jurisdiction?" Ecclestone said, presenting some of the problems in maintaining international order.
It was suggested to Ecclestone that American racing officials view FISA's actions merely as trade barriers preventing the export of Indy-car racing.
"Nobody would want to come to America and do something against the laws of America," Ecclestone replied. "And in this case, it's probably the same thing."
William Stokkan, CART's chairman of the board, disagrees. "If there's one thing I've learned in 20 years in business," Stokkan said, "it's that when people tell me it's not the money, it's the principle, it's the money."
Stokkan said that CART has tried to play by FISA's rules.
"Every time we try to be the nice guys and try to play by the established rules, there is a tendency to change the rules," he said.
For example, a FISA rule that allowed CART to run about three races each year outside the United States was abolished about the time CART announced plans for the race in Japan.
For now, CART plans to hold the Australian race, even though FISA has threatened an international ban on all drivers, teams and officials who take part.
The Indy 500 is one of those races held under FISA approval. In 1979, during the battle that brought CART into existence, the United States Auto Club, which runs the Indy 500, tried to refuse the entries of several CART teams. A United States District Court enjoined U.S.A.C. and the Speedway from doing so, and it is unlikely that any future effort to ban entries from the 500 would survive a legal challenge.
And it is doubtful that George would want to run a race without anyone named Unser, Andretti or Mears.
 But FISA could gain the upper hand if Al Unser Jr. and Michael Andretti, CART's two biggest young stars, could be offered enough money to switch to Formula One, a form of racing that greatly interests the two second-generation racers.
Without those two drivers, and with the expected retirement of A. J. Foyt and Mario Andretti in the next few years, CART wouldn't have as much to offer the speedway.

Newsstands Dwindle, But Some Still Thrive

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WAKEFIELD, R.I.

 BODY:
Magazine publishers nervously monitoring the decline in newsstand sales across the country might be cheered by a visit to the Healy News Store in this tiny New England town.
 People drive from as far as Massachusetts to buy the 3,000 different magazines stocked by Steve Davis, the manager and son-in-law of the owner, Freeman Healy. In 1962 Mr. Healy and his brother, Richard, bought the business, which had been run by one family for more than half a century at a time when newsstands and paper routes were an essential part of the American way of life. 
By the beginning of the 1980's, however, most newsstands had disappeared except in large cities and at airports and terminals. Even more important, the magazine-buying habits of Americans had drastically changed. Today, magazines are sold mostly in supermarkets and convenience stores.
 
Newsstand Sales Are Falling
 And single-copy magazine sales are on the decline as a result of rising cover prices, competing uses of leisure time and discounted subscriptions that reduce the cost of each issue to way below its cover price.
 By the first half of this year, 234 of the 421 magazines that reported their figures to the Audit Bureau of Circulations showed declines in single-copy sales from a year earlier. The biggest decline was felt by magazines with circulations of a million or more.
 "People are watching their spending more carefully, and we are theorizing that people who used to buy three magazines are now buying one or two," said Robert Cohn, a vice president at the Magazine Publishers of America.
People are also asking for a new type of magazine. Ten years ago, the average wholesaler sold 1,300 different magazines; today he sells more than 3,000. Withthe advent of desktop publishing, almost anybody can put out a magazine -- and many do. This has given rise to "niche" publishing, small magazines that sell maybe 100,000 to 150,000 copies and are devoted to single topics.
 
Healy's Advantage
 This is where the Healy News Store with its 60 feet of magazine racks has the edge over supermarkets and drugstores, where magazines compete for space with other products.
 The bulk of the sales in supermarkets take place at the checkout counter, where a handful of the most popular magazines and tabloids like The National Enquirer are available. In the larger supermarkets there are also "reading centers," which carry several hundred magazines.
 "Most supermarkets are going to have 500 or 600 titles, but Healy gets 3,000 titles, or basically every magazine we've got," said Charles Cellar, vice president and general manager of Ocean State News, who is Mr. Davis's distributor.
 John A. Cowley 2d, a distributor in Jefferson City, Mo., said supermarket chains were increasingly cutting back and limiting magazine sales to checkout counters.
 But Mr. Cowley is convinced that the industry has come full circle. "The last five to eight years have seen the re-emergence of small magazine newsstands in medium-sized cities," he said. "The time is right for the rebirth of that small hometown news center."
 For example, four years ago in St. Louis, he said, there were four newsstands. Today there are 14.
 What is on the cover of a magazine is, of course, a key element in newsstand sales. So is the price. Over the last 30 years, the price of magazines has risen about one and a half times the inflation rate. In 1960, the average magazine cost 39 cents. Last year it was $2.44, according to the Magazine Publishers of America.
 About half of the magazines on display are sold. Like most retailers, Mr. Davis gets 20 percent of the price of each magazine he sells from the distributor and an additional 10 percent from the publisher.
 
Single-Copy Share of Sales
 On average, single-copy sales represent about 30 percent of magazine sales while subscriptions account for the rest. Over all, taking into account both subscriptions and single-copy sales, 35 of the top 55 magazines reporting to the Audit Bureau of Circulations in the first six months of the year lost circulation.
 The downward trend in single-copy sales reported by the A.B.C. may not tell the full story because the bureau only tracks the larger magazines. A new study by the Periodicals Institute, the marketing arm of the single-copy sales industry, reports that when 3,000 magazines are taken into account, single-copy sales are flat, and not declining. Indeed, many niche publications are growing.
 One reason that Healy News Store has managed to hold its own is that it has been willing to change with the times. Originally, it sold stationery items until these stopped being profitable. In 1983, Mr. Healy began to sell drugstore items and groceries as well as magazines.
 "Over the last seven or eight years, most grocery stores started selling magazines," Mr. Davis said. "So now we sell groceries."
 While many publishers are worried about the downward trend in single-copy sales, Mr. Cowley, the Missouri distributor, is optimistic.
 "My Dad used to have a saying: 'This is a nickel-and-dime business. You don't make much on each item, but you sell a lot of items,' " he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Yielding Its Police Role In Panama to a Rebuilt Force

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
Marking the final stage of the military occupation that followed the American invasion here, the United States plans to end the last joint patrols of American and Panamanian police teams throughout the country by late November, officials say.
A senior officer of the United States Military Support Group, Col. Jack Pryor, said American officials were pleased with the progress of the restructured Panamanian Public Force and with its new civilian commander, Ebrahim Asvat. He said the American military police who have supervised all security operations since the invasion on Dec. 20 are no longer considered essential to preserve public order. 
 "We have been withdrawing out of the police business," Colonel Pryor said in an interview at his office in a former Panamanian intelligence headquarters. "By Nov. 11 we will have all our troops out of the city with the exception of Chorrillo and Colon, and those will be withdrawn by Nov. 28."
Chorrillo is a poor area of Panama City that was largely destroyed by combat and fire during the invasion. Colon, the country's main Atlantic port, was also a scene of heavy fighting and has suffered from high unemployment. Both are considered high-crime areas.
 
Police Commanders Replaced
 The withdrawal of the American police advisers, who for 10 months have ridden with Panamanian officers, comes after months of screening intended to rid the Public Force of officers considered ineffective or unreliable holdovers from the Government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The change also follows a period of turmoil that has included the recent replacement of two successive police commanders, the retirement of 142 senior officers, and unsubstantiated rumors of a coup plot by disgruntled officers in an outlying province.
Those events, together with persistent problems of street crime, have been frequently cited by Panamanian politicians and editorial writers as evidence that the Public Force is neither effective nor mature enough to be left unsupervised.
But American officials described the incidents as minor distractions from the larger evolution of the restructured Panamanian force, which has been stripped of its military character and sharply reduced in size. They expressed confidence that the force could assume full responsibility for maintaining public order without posing a threat to the democratically elected Government of President Guillermo Endara.
 
U.S. Force Down to 10,000
 The ending of joint patrols also corresponds with the Bush Administration's strategy of reducing the broader American military presence here. A spokesman for the United States Southern Command, Col. Joseph S. Panvini, said the total number of American troops here had fallen to about 10,000, the lowest level since tensions between the United States and the Noriega Government began to rise in May 1989, and far below the peak of 25,000 or so during the invasion.
The new Public Force has about 10,000 men, who work in eight-hour shifts and return to their homes when off duty rather than remaining with their units in military barracks, as they did under General Noreiga.
Most are armed with only sidearms or shotguns, but some special-duty units have now been equipped with Taiwanese-made assault rifles modeled after the American M-16 to give the force greater firepower against drug traffickers or other organized criminals, American officers said.
Criticism of the new force's performance thus far has centered on the rapid growth of street crime in Panama City and other urban areas, including daring holdups like the robbery of more than 40 guests at a well-known Panama City restaurant recently. The victims at the restaurant, which is less than a block from the United States Embassy, included several embassy officials.
Concern has also grown over the Government's ability to fight a sharp increase in narcotics trafficking from neighboring Colombia through Panama's remote jungles and ragged coastline.
But diplomats, American military officers and Panamanian officials said those problems have been balanced against strong public mistrust of any police apparatus, especially one involving former members of the Noriega Government.
 
All Senior Officers Ousted
 According to American figures, all officers above the rank of major in General Noriega's force have been dismissed since the invasion. Fifty-seven percent of majors have been retired, 40 percent of captains and 28 percent of lieutenants.
The remaining force has gone through a mandatory three-week retraining course supervised by the United States Department of Justice, and the first class of 260 recruits is to begin training at a new national police academy on Nov. 6.
The Government announced recently that it was investigating several lower-ranking officers in the outlying province of Chiriqui, near the Costa Rican border, on suspicion of plotting a coup against President Endara.
But senior Government officials admitted that the evidence, which involved isolated bomb attacks on utility poles in the countryside, was "fuzzy." And American officials, noting that no Panamanian officers had the means or opportunity to try to seize power, categorically dismissed the rumors.
Asked whether Panamanians believed that the United States would permit a coup, the American Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton, said flatly, "We wouldn't -- and they know it."

German Terror Expert Says Iraqis Have Front Companies Across Europe

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Iraq's intelligence service is operating a network of outwardly legitimate businesses across Western Europe, using them as bases for espionage, weapons procurement and possible terrorist attacks, a former senior West German intelligence official says.
The companies, mostly export-import companies and used-car dealerships, are also working to circumvent the United Nations trade ebargo against Iraq, said the former official, Hans Josef Horchem. He said he based his assertions on information from officials in German and foreign intelligence agencies. 
 Mr. Horchem, a former director of West Germany's domestic intelligence service who now runs the Institute for Terrorism Research near Bonn, said the network of roughly 10 main companies is under the direct command of the Iraqi secret service and closely linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
The Popular Front, a terrorist organization led by Ahmed Jabril, is suspected of planting the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 270 people.
 
 3 Companies in Germany
 Mr. Horchem said there were three Iraqi front companies in Germany and that they were operating in Hamburg and Hesse state. He declined to name them and said no action has been taken against them because of insufficient evidence. Other companies are operating in France and Britain, he added.
German Government officials confirmed that the matter was being investigated. "There is information coming out of special sources that is being checked on," said Roland Bachmeier, the spokesman for the German Interior Ministry. He declined to comment further. United States Embassy officials also declined to comment.
A Government official who spoke on the condition that he not be identified said that Mr. Horchem's sources "are of course the secret services."
"But the evidence so far is not enough for any kind of action," he said. "If we knew it for sure, something would be done. But as you can see, there is neither an investigation by police or by a state prosecutor yet. I would say that the matter is in a preliminary stage."
The official confirmed that companies serving as bases for the Iraqi secret service were not confined to Germany. "They are in all of Europe," he said. "And not every company in Germany with Iraqi connections is one of these bases. On the other hand, Iraq is a totalitarian country which certainly has some people on a tight leash."
The businesses are staffed by Iraqi secret service personnel, and some also employ members of the Popular Front, Mr. Horchem said. He said the companies were prepared to launch terrorist attacks should the situation in the Persian Gulf shift against Iraq.
"They are chained bloodhounds, waiting for orders from Saddam Hussein to set them into action," he said. "When people fly in the companies give them a base, providing an apartment, weapons and explosives and a number they can call, so they do not have to bring in weapons themselves. This also is the case elsewhere in Europe."
The French and the British are even more threatened than the Germans, he said, because of the active role their military forces are playing in the Persian Gulf crisis.
German Government officials disputed Mr. Horchem's contention that the companies are used as arms depots, and a spokesman for the Iraqi Embassy in Bonn dismissed the assertion as ridiculous. "It is just some statement that is popping up now and that will also pop up in the future," he said. Asked if Iraqi intelligence agents were active in Germany, he replied: "I don't know. I don't think that the world's secret services make their actions public anywhere, do they?"
 
 Iraq Rejects Terror Accusations
 The Iraqi spokesman also dismissed talk of terrorist attacks, calling it "absolute nonsense."
Suggestions that Iraq had built an extensive European network to obtain arms and weapons-related technology emerged publicly last spring, when British officials seized forged steel tubes, saying they were meant for use in the construction of an Iraqi "supergun." The investigation uncovered a network of legitimate European companies directly or partly owned by a group called the Al-Arabi Trading Company of Baghdad.
This month customs officers raided the British headquarters of Matrix Churchill, an Iraqi-owned engineering group, as part of an investigation into suspected illegal exports of machine tools to Iraq.
The French Government is investigating charges that some French companies are breaking the United Nations embargo.
Germany has been accused of taking an overly passive role in the military standoff in the gulf and in monitoring sensitive exports. Diplomats in Bonn suggested that the disclosures about the secret Iraqi network may have been made to deflect such criticism, by showing Germany as active behind the scenes.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced on Sept. 15 that Germany would provide $1.87 billion in military equipment for the international force confronting Iraq and in economic aid to nations like Jordan and Egypt whose economies have been hurt by the embargo. Mr. Kohl said the German Constitution prohibited Bonn from sending troops outside Europe.
German industry has been deeply involved in supplying Iraq with weapons-related technologies. In a secret briefing for the German Parliament's Committee on Economic Affairs several weeks ago, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann listed five areas in which German companies have been involved in supplying industrial plants, technology or expertise to Iraq.
 
 Cannons and Missiles
 A member of the committee said Mr. Hausmann mentioned the supply of forging plants to build cannons; the involvement of German companies in the development of the "super gun;" the supply of missile technology; the modernization of the Soviet Scud missiles already in Iraq's arsenal and the supply of technology needed for nuclear arms production.
"He left out in his statement all the stuff about chemical plants, poison gas and the weapons exports over third countries, like France," the committee member said.
He added that Mr. Haussmann, in the face of criticism, insisted that Germany's existing arms export laws were sufficient.
He said the items on Mr. Haussmann's list were supplied to Iraq because "at that time Saddam Hussein was our friend. Others did the same thing, like the French."

HEADLINE: Needless Breast Cancer Deaths Reported Among New York's Poor

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Poor women in New York City are dying of breast cancer unnecessarily, primarily because early detection is not widely practiced in the municipal hospital system, according to a report released yesterday by City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.
The report said the Health and Hospital Corporation's policy of not performing routine mammograms had contributed to a death rate from breast cancer among its patients that was three times the national average of 24 percent. 
 About 65 percent of the breast cancers detected at city-owned hospitals are not spotted until the cancer has reached an advanced stage, the report said. Nationally 20to 25 percent of breast cancers are diagnosed that late, the Comptroller said.
Women whose breast cancer is detected early are generally believed to have a survival rate of 90 percent, meaning they are still alive five years later.
 
High Death Rates Reported
 The Comptroller's report said that at public hospitals like Kings County in Brooklyn more than 70 percent of breast cancer patients were dead within five years of detection. At Harlem Hospital, it said, the mortality rate is 78 percent.
"When all the available medical knowledge shows that early detection leads to high survival rates, it's appalling that H.H.C. does not have a stated policy or practice of performing routine screening techniques," Ms. Holtzman said. "It means that thousands of poor women will suffer and die needlessly from a very treatable disease."
More than 1,500 women died of breast cancer in New York City in 1988, a 5 percent increase over the total in 1987 and an 18 percent increase over the 1982 figure, the city's Department of Health has said. The city's 11 public hospitals, which make up the largest municipal health-care system in the country, are the primary health-care providers for many poor New Yorkers.
 
Gaps in Prevention
 Last year the American Cancer Society said poor people had failed to benefit from advances in cancer prevention, detectionand treatment. It reported pronounced differences in the outcome for patients, depending on race and socio-economic status.
Eight of the 11 city hospitals have no policy or program on breast cancer detection. The American Cancer Society suggests that women 35 to 39 years old receive mammograms every two years, women over 40 get them every one to two years and women over 50 get them every year.
Fred Winters, a spokesman for the hospital corporation, said yesterday that steps had already been taken to improve breast cancer treatment. Earlier this month Dr. J. Emilio Carrillo, the hospital corporation's president, announced formation of a task force to study breast health care. The panel is to report to him within 90 days.
Dr. Carrillo said there were many reasons for the breast-cancer problem, among them low educational levels among women using public hospitals and the hospitals' own lack of educational and screening programs.
 
Action Is Promised
 "This is a critical health-care issue for the women in the communities we serve," Dr. Carrillo said. "Even given the current round of budget cuts, H.H.C. will address this issue."
The Comptroller's report showed that most breast cancers were found in areas with older and more affluent populations -- the Riverdale section of the Bronx, the Upper East Side of Manhattan and Forest Hills, Queens. Most of the cancers are detected early, the report said. Late-stage detection occurs in poorer neighborhoods like Central Harlem, East New York and the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, the Comptroller found.
The report also found that after cancer had been diagnosed, women who used city-owned hospitals failed to get follow-up care, including biopsies, 30 percent of the time.
The Comptroller said the breast cancer policies resulted in $323 million a year in unnecessary expenditures for the women admitted to city hospitals.

HEADLINE: Experts Disagree on Effects of Medicare Reduction

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Hospital executives said yesterday that the cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals and doctors in the 1991 budget bill may lower the quality of medical care for patients. But Bush Administration officials said the $34 billion in savings would be achieved mainly by eliminating wasteful practices by hospitals and cutting payments for hundreds of medical procedures that they say are overpriced.
Payments to hospitals would be reduced by $16.8 billion over five years under the terms of the bill, which President Bush has said he will sign. Physicians would lose $9.5 billion. About $6 billion would come from requiring private employers to pick up more of the costs of elderly and disabled employees and retirees eligible for Medicare. Reductions in other areas, like payments to clinical laboratories and for dialysis treatment, account for the rest. 
 The people who benefit from Medicare will have to pay $10 billion more in monthly premiums for physicians and deductible payments, for a total savings of $44 billion in spending.
 
Some Hospitals Fare Better
 But the budget softens the cuts for "teaching hospitals" that educate doctors, as well as for those that care for large numbers of poor people and those in rural areas.
The cuts will hit hardest at city and suburban hospitals that serve middle-class patients, said Michael D. Bromberg, a spokesman for investor-owned chains. "The people who suffer will be the patients," said Mr. Bromberg, the executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems. "There will be less money for new technology and staff. Hospitals may have to reduce some services."
But Gail R. Wilensky, who heads the Administration's Medicare program, said the cuts "should not be regarded as drastic."
Congressional aides said $11.3 billion, the largest part of the savings on hospitals, would come by reducing annual increases in payments so they do not keep up with inflation.
The bill would also reduce by $4 billion the Medicare payments to hospitals for capital spending, such as for new equipment and buildings.
But Congress left $1 billion extra to ease the cuts for 1,537 hospitals that have more than their share of uninsured patients unable to pay for their care. Hundreds of rural hospitals would also get a $1 billion break over the five years. And teaching hospitals would not be charged $485 million in assessments for earlier overpayments.
Doctors would lose $3 billion in annual increases tied to inflation; $2.5 billion in reduced payments on 1,400 procedures like cataract operations that are considered overpriced; $1.5 billion in reduced payments to radiologists, anesthesiologists and pathologists; $880 million in reduced payments to new doctors and for surgical assistants, and $725 million in payments made for interpreting simple electrocardiogram tests.
Some private employers were concerned that hospitals and doctors would try to make up their losses by raising fees to private insurers.
Donald Young, executive director of a Congressional advisory committee on hospital payments, said patient care may suffer from the budget cuts. But he said hospitals had been raising their Medicare charges by 4 percent to 5 percent beyond inflation, mainly by charging for "more tests, more surgery, more procedures per patient." He said savings may come by doing fewer tests on a patient who may be routinely checked with blood tests, X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging and computerized scans.

HEADLINE: Soviets to Let West Convert Ruble Profits

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 29

 BODY:
In a move aimed at easing one of the most formidable barriers to the Soviet market, Western business executives will be allowed to exchange their profits in rubles into foreign currency starting in January, bank officials said today.
Officials at the main state bank, Gosbank, and the foreign trading bank, Vneshekombank, said that all companies, including Western concerns, would be able to take their ruble earnings to new currency exchanges and bid on foreign currencies offered for sale by Soviet businesses and the Government. 
 But the bankers and foreign business executives said a number of crucial uncertainties remained, including the amount of foreign currency that would be available for sale, what the exchange rate would be in the highly competitive auctions, and whether the Soviet Government would even be ready to open the promised exchanges in January.
Westerners withheld their enthusiasm today, noting that this would not be the first Kremlin promise to disappear into the bottomless muck of Soviet reality.
"It's a good skeleton," said Mark S. Vecchio, a Moscow-based specialist in business law for the Coudert Brothers law firm. "Now let's get some meat on the bones."
One Western diplomat said the most important aspect of the promised new rules on foreign investment, which are intended to implement a broadly worded Presidential decree published on Friday, was the evidence that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is increasingly turning his attention to the role foreigners can play in his economy.
"Foreign investment is now an integral part of Gorbachev's program, rather than an addendum to the program," the diplomat said.
After an initial euphoria about the vast, untapped Soviet market, foreign investors have grown more frustrated by the realities of an investment climate with few coherent laws and little experience in Western business practices.
Even as the central Government gradually loosens the restraints on foreign investors, new obstacles crop up, like the disputes among central and local governments over ownership of natural resources.
 
Restriction on Profits
 One of the main annoyances has been the limitation on taking profits out of the country.
Foreign joint ventures can now repatriate dollars and other foreign currency profits only if they actually generate such profits.
Thus, an American company that sells pizza to foreign tourists in Moscow or that produces something here for export to Western Europe may take home a share of the profits. But companies that sell products to Soviet consumers find themselves awash in relatively worthless rubles.
Some firms have come up with creative schemes to swap the rubles for goods they can sell in the West -- from pickles to pianos to optical lenses. But many more simply throw up their hands and give up. The majority of Soviet-Western ventures never advance beyond the initial letter of intent.
 
Barrier to Be Removed
 Aleksandr Y. Voitenkov, the deputy chief of the Gosbank's foreign currency department, said in an interview that the current restrictions on exporting profits would be dropped and foreigners would be allowed to take home foreign currencies bought at the new exchanges.
He said most of the hard currency would be offered for sale by Soviet exporting enterprises with dollars and German marks on hand.
"The state may contribute some hard currency from its reserves," Mr. Voitenkov said. But this is "not certain."
The problem is that without the sale of some currency from the state reserves, the amount offered for sale will be extremely limited, and the price will skyrocket.
The Government has experimented with a few auctions of hard currency since 1988, open only to a limited number of Soviet enterprises. Now, the auctions will be held on a regular basis and open to any party.
 
Higher Rate at Auctions
 The dollar has fetched about 25 rubles at the auctions, far above the three official exchange rates maintained by the Government: 0.6 rubles to the dollar for international statistical comparisons, 1.8 rubles to the dollar for trade and investment transactions, and 6 rubles to the dollar for tourists.
"Just adding more people to the demand side for dollars won't help unless the state is going to ante up some money to keep rates from being overly ridiculous," said an economist at a Western embassy. "Under the best of circumstances, it's very difficult to make an investment if you can't calculate your rate of return."
Mr. Vecchio, the lawyer, said the Government would be strongly tempted to limit the amount of foreign currency put on sale to prevent its reserves from being drained.
"There's no way this country could throw open the borders to massive capital flight," he said. "It would be like an airplane at 30,000 feet when the window's blown open."

HEADLINE: Figuring the Tax Impact And Acting to Cut the Cost

SERIES: The New Tax Law: Calculating Its Effect on You - Second of Five Articles

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
With a deficit-cutting plan finally in place, the first question most taxpayers want answered is whether their own income taxes are going up or down. The easiest way to figure that out is to look at a copy of last year's returns and apply the new rules to a few key numbers.
Few married couples with taxable income below $80,000 or single people with income below $50,000 need be concerned. Their taxes are not likely to be affected. For those above those levels, the difference will probably amount to only a few hundred dollars, unless they are really rich. 
 "The taxes are not that astronomical; no one is going to be made destitute by this," said George E. L. Barbee, who is in charge of personal financial planning for Price Waterhouse in Boston. "What is disturbing is that it is open season on tax rates and open season on deductions."
The new rules set a top rate of 31 percent, limit itemized deductions and phase out personal exemptions above certain thresholds. This will take just a few minutes to calculate. Once taxpayers see where they are headed, they can fine-tune their calculations. The new rules will take effect at the beginning of 1991, and by trying "what if" projections for both 1990 and 1991 taxpayers can see whether some shifts could lower their total tax bills.
For example, taxpayers could decide whether charitable contributions would give them the biggest deductions in 1990 or 1991.
The first number needed is on Line 31 of Form 1040, adjusted gross income. Next is Line 34, itemized deductions. Taxpayers with an adjusted gross income above $100,000 should multiply the difference by .03 to get their deduction limitation. Subtract that number from the itemized deductions to see what would be allowed under 1991 rules. Next, subtract that number and the amount for personal exemptions (Line 36) from the adjusted gross income to get the taxable income.
William J. Goldberg, national director of personal financial services for KPMG Peat Marwick in Houston, called the deduction limit "a hidden rate increase." Indeed, it puts those affected in a 31.93 percent tax bracket -- the additional 0.93 percent is the 31 percent rate times the 3 percent limit.
Although the Government has not yet released tax tables to be used under the new law, David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young in Washington, has done preliminary calculations to give taxpayers an idea of what the results would be. To figure their tax, he said, a married couple filing jointly should subtract $82,050 from taxable income, multiply that result by .31 and add that result to $18,560. (The capital gains portion should be figured at 28 percent.) Single taxpayers should subtract $49,200 from their taxable income, multiply the result by .31 and add that result to $11,130.
Next, those with taxable income between $150,000 and $272,500 need to add an amount to their taxes for the phaseout of personal exemptions. Above that, it is eliminated. This calculation is considerably more complicated than the 3 percent floor on itemized deductions.
"It's son of bubble," Mr. Berenson said. (The "bubble" refers to the 5 percent surcharge that now forces some people to pay a 33 percent marginal tax rate, the rate on the last dollar earned.) But, he added, the most anyone could lose would be $636 per exemption (that is, 31 percent of a $2,050 exemption, using the 1990 number) so adding that number times the number of exemptions to the tax owed will give a worst-case scenario. Exemptions, which are adjusted for inflation, will rise again next year.
 
A Closer Approximation

Couples in the 31 percent bracket who want a closer approximation can use this formula: adjusted gross income minus $150,000, divided by $122,500, times $636, times number of exemptions. Single taxpayers should use $100,000 in the formula instead of $150,000. The result should be added to the tax calculation. Taxpayers can compare the results with the tax on Line 38 of last year's return to see whether they win, lose or draw under the new income tax rules.
To see how else the new law hits them, wage-earners must calculate the additional Medicare tax of 1.45 percent for each dollar earned between $51,300 and $125,000, and consumers must figure the additional tax of a nickel a gallon on gasoline, 16 cents on a six-pack of beer, and 4 cents on a pack of cigarettes.
John L. Norman Jr., national director of taxation of Pannell Kerr Forster, in Washington, said, "The basic strategy has always been to try to accelerate your deductions, and that basic rule still applies, because you're getting it earlier," and those now taxed at 33 percent on their top dollar will be near that next year, or even above it, depending on their personal-exemption situation.
For the most affluent taxpayers, those now taxed at a flat 28 percent, itemized deductions like state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions will be worth more next year, when they are in a 31 percent bracket, and even higher, considering the hidden effects of the deduction limit and the exemption phaseout. But Mr. Norman noted that the projected dollar gain must be offset by the delay in getting it and by the risk of having planning go awry if the taxpayer ends up being liable for the alternative minimum tax.
Joel S. Isaacson, a partner in Weber Lipshie & Company, in New York, cited the example of a client in the top 28 percent bracket who had received a large severance payment this year. He plans to pay all his state and local taxes before Dec. 31, so he can deduct them on his 1990 return, rather than risk waiting until April 15 to pay them, being thrown into the alternative minimum tax in 1991 and losing the value of the deduction.
Because the deduction limit is based on adjusted gross income, not on the size of the deductions, the amount to be lost in 1991 will not be changed by moving deductions from one year to the next. Only lowering the adjusted income will cut the loss.
 
Business Deductions Cited
 
 
Lorin D. Luchs, a tax partner in BDO Seidman's national tax office in Washington, advised people who could to "revisit the area of where things can be taken as a business deduction."
Partners who have unreimbursed partnership expenses or self-employed people who have legitimate home offices to which a portion of mortgage interest and real estate taxes can be allocated, for example, may be able to take business deductions, he said. Accountants call these "above the line" items because they keep down the adjusted gross income on page one of the 1040 form instead of being taken later as itemized deductions on Schedule A. Thus, they are more valuable.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Posts $214 Million Loss in Quarter

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Hit by a softening economy, eroding car prices and lost production of its new mini-van, the Chrysler Corporation today posted a $214 million loss in the third quarter. That compared with a profit of $331 million, or $1.42 a share, in the period last year.
In addition, analysts speculated that Ford and General Motors would announce substantial quarterly write-offs this week, cutting into already weak earnings. [D4.] 
 Chrysler's announcement came as negotiators for Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers were still in talks at midnight about a new labor agreement. A union official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that important job security, pension and health-care issues remained unresolved, although the union told workers to report to their jobs until notified otherwise. The contract expiration deadline was tonight.
Local union representatives from around the country have been invited here for a meeting on Thursday, suggesting that union leaders expect a tentative agreement by then.
Talks between the U.A.W. and Chrysler have been the most difficult of all industry-labor negotiations, which started in July, because the auto maker says it must have a less expensive contract than those already signed at the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation. So far, the union has rejected Chrysler's position.
But Chrysler's third-quarter results were graphic evidence of the difficult conditions the company is encountering.
Last year's profit for the quarter was inflated by $309 million as a result of a one-time gain from the sale of 75 million shares of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. Chrysler continues to hold a minority stake in the Japanese car maker.
The financial results for Chrysler, the No. 3 American auto maker, were within the range projected for the last few weeks by most automotive analysts. On the New York Stock Exchange today, Chrysler's shares lost 12.5 cents each, to $11. Despite the loss, analysts said Chrysler's financial condition remained stable.
"It's comforting that the cash and marketable securities are at $3.7 billion, compared with $2.1 billion last year," said Scott Merlis, an automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York.
Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco, agreed that Chrysler's financial condition was stable, but he noted that the company must repay $4 billion in debt by the end of 1991. "The economy better be in a recovery by the middle of next year or Chrysler will have a financial crisis," he said.
 
Looking to a Tough Year
 Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, said, "We anticipated 1990 would be a tough year for Chrysler and for the industry, so we launched our major cost-cutting program over a year ago."
Jerome B. York, the executive vice president for finance, estimated that Chrysler spent an average of $1,250 a vehicle in incentives during the quarter, compared with $850 in the period last year. The company expects to spend about $2.5 billion on incentives throughout 1990.
Chrysler's sales and revenues slipped by 14.6 percent, to $6.49 billion, from $7.6 billion last year.
Chrysler's consolidated earnings included record results from its finance subsidiary, which reported a profit of $83 million, up by 9.2 percent from the $76 million earned in the period last year.
 
Lost Van Production
 The auto maker said it had lost production of 56,000 mini-vans during the quarter because of the changeover to 1991 models from 1990 models at plants in Windsor, Ontario, and St. Louis. The mini-van, which has been extensively restyled to compete with domestic and foreign competitors, has been a leading source of profit.
Mr. Iacocca said he expected Chrysler to reverse its sliding share of the American vehicle market in the fourth quarter. He cited increased mini-van availability, the introduction of two low-priced subcompact models -- the Dodge Shadow America and Plymouth Sundance America -- and increased fleet business.
Earlier this year, Chrysler had said it was cutting back on its fleet business because it was not profitable. Mr. York said today that "the fleet business, at current market conditions, is more than marginally profitable." He said the resale values of used cars had been increasing since the third quarter of last year, improving the profitability of fleets sold to car-rental companies and leasing companies.
Total factory sales of Chrysler vehicles totaled 412,723 in the quarter, down by 14.7 percent from the 1989 quarter. The auto maker said its share of the North American retail vehicle market was 11.2 percent in the quarter, compared with 12.8 percent a year ago.

HEADLINE: Substantial Power on Spending Is Shifted From Congress to Bush Procedure Intended to Guarantee Cuts Are Made

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Congress has ceded substantial power over spending decisions to the Bush Administration's Office of Management and Budget under procedures approved as part of the $490 billion deficit-reduction package.
The procedures, intended to insure that spending cuts agreed to in the package are made, are a complicated variation on the existing Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law. Like that law, last revised in 1987, they would require automatic spending cuts if Congress fails to meet its deficit reduction commitments, but there are important differences. 
 The most important is the shift of emphasis to the actual level of spending on Federal programs, from an arbitrary deficit target, which can change dramatically depending on the state of the economy and the accuracy of economic assumptions. In addition, Congress will be monitored throughout the year to see whether it is meeting its targets. In the past such toting up was done at the end of the fiscal year.
 
Changes in Gramm-Rudman
 Gramm-Rudman utilizes a single target for the Federal budget deficit at the end of each fiscal year and makes the entire budget subject to automatic spending cuts if the year's deficit target is not met.
But the new system would use three spending caps -- one each for domestic programs, the military and foreign aid -- and Congress would not be obliged to meet a deficit target. Cuts would be made only in the category where the spending cap has been exceeded. Lawmakers and the White House have already agreed on the amounts of the caps.
Therefore, cuts in military spending could not be used to offset overruns in domestic programs. If Congress should decide, for example, that housing programs need more Federal dollars, the money would have to come from other domestic programs. Under the old law, the money could come from military spending, so long as the overall deficit target was met.
Under current budget procedures, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Tax, Congress's in-house budget experts, are responsible for the estimates of how much a particular spending program will cost or how much a particular tax increase will provide in new revenue.
 
More Authority for O.M.B.
 While Congress uses these estimates to devise the budget, it is the Administration's Office of Management and Budget that decides at the end of the year how much the budget has fallen short of the deficit target and therefore how much of an automatic spending cut is required to bring the budget back into line.
The new system will give the O.M.B. even more authority, in effect allowing the Administration to determine early in the budget process whether the spending and tax levels that Congress is working with are within the caps.
Politically, the new process provides something for everyone. The sponsors of the original budget-balancing bill get to say it is not dead. The Democrats are liberated from thinking about deficit targets that can sometimes be arbitrary. And the Administration can say it has put into place a true enforcement mechanism.
But Stanley E. Collender, a former House Budget Committee aide who is now a Federal budget specialist for Price Waterhouse, said the sheer amount of numbers and details that would have to be maintained by the O.M.B. to monitor Congressional spending action would give the Administration extraordinary power over decisions normally left to Congress.
"It may sound like green-eyeshade stuff," said a senior aide on the Senate Budget Committee, "but you're talking about potentially billions of dollars in how the costs of these programs are figured."
In addition, the budget office will be the agency deciding, for example, whether research on nuclear power is a military program or a domestic one. Including it under the domestic cap would leave less money for domestic programs and provide leeway for military programs.
Similarly, if the Congressional tax-writing committees decide they want to cut the Social Security tax, it is the O.M.B. that will decide how much money needs to be raised elsewhere to offset such a cut.
If the spending cap is exceeded in one of the three categories, the budget office would dictate how much money be cut, and Congress would have to comply within 15 days.
 
Dramatic Shift of Power
 "I don't think people realize just how much power has been shifted from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other," said a senior Congressional aide involved in the negotiations on the new rules. Democrats promoted the changes in the summer budget negotiations at Andrews Air Force Base, as a way of warding off the White House insistence on a line-item veto, he said, "but I think we may find that in a subterfuge sort of way the White House actually got what it wanted."
In the new process, new Gramm-Rudman deficit targets for each of the next five years will remain on the books, but Congress will no longer be responsible for achieving them.
Rudolf G. Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the new enforcement system was far more practical than the across-the-board cuts stipulated under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
"The problem with Gramm-Rudman," he said, "is that it was too severe. That's why we never had a full-fledged sequester," the automatic spending cuts.
"I can imagine, however, how this could work," Mr. Penner continued. "The new rules are subject to accounting gimmicks, too, but there should be less incentive for it."
 
Focus on Entitlement Programs
 Allen Schick, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland and an author of the 1974 legislation that created the framework for the current budget system, is less convinced. The problem, he said, is that the new procedures focus too much on the wrong part of the budget and fail to deal sufficiently with the fundamental budget problem, the inexorable growth of entitlement programs, which remain separate from the three budget categories. The programs, which provide benefits to anyone who meets their criteria, include Social Security and Medicare and account for an increasing share of overall Federal spending.
By and large, entitlement programs were exempt from cuts under Gramm-Rudman, but the new procedures will make an introductory effort at containing their costs. If Congress chooses to add benefits in the programs, the additional benefits will be subject to a "pay as you go" system and lawmakers must offset them with cuts elsewhere in entitlement programs.
Given the difficulty that lawmakers had this year in restricting the growth in Medicare and the refusal to even consider limiting the growth of Social Security, many in Congress worry that it will continue to be impossible to make fundamental changes in entitlement programs.
But Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who was an author of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, said he remained hopeful. "It may be that we can now start having the kind of debates on real policy that we have not been able to have," he said. "I think the next few years are going to be very interesting."
For Democrats who are concerned that the spending caps for military programs and foreign aid were set too high, there will be an opportunity to adjust the system for the 1994 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, 1993. Under the enforcement system, the final two years of the budget agreement stipulate that spending for the military, foreign aid and domestic programs be consolidated under a single cap. This will permit lawmakers to reallocate money among the three divisions.
"We're almost certainly going to have to rethink everything after 1993," the Democratic budget strategist said, "because the deficit numbers are likely to be higher than is politically acceptable for either party. The weak economy virtually guarantees that."

HEADLINE: In Minnesota Politics, a Test of Character

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAUK CENTRE, Minn., Oct. 29

 BODY:
Sinclair Lewis, who grew up here and mocked the sanctimonious provincialism of rural Minnesota in his novels, would have been stunned by the antics of the state's politicians this year.
Arlan Stangeland, who has represented Sauk Centre and the rest of northwestern Minnesota in Congress since 1977, is in trouble because he made several hundred calls to or from the phone of a Virginia woman who is a lobbyist. He says it was all business. But in this land of lakes and birches and small towns, where politicians talk constantly about family values and villages of 400 people support three churches, his behavior has raised the suspicion that he was playing around, and has raised questions about the 60-year-old legislator's character. 
 "Stangeland's a strong family man," goes the damaging refrain in the coffee shops where farmers and shopkeepers gather to discuss the events of the day. "He likes families so much that he wants to have two of them."
 
Special Attention
 The revelations about Mr. Stangeland, a Republican, attracted special attention because Senator Dave Durenberger, also a Republican, had been the focus for months of news reports concerning allegations of improper financial behavior, and Mr. Durenberger was later censured by the Senate.
These are not the norms in Minnesota politics, which has had a reputation for almost painful high-mindedness since the days of Harold Stassen and Hubert H. Humphrey. The good times are supposed to roll in New Orleans, a hedonistic Creole city, not in Minneapolis, an earnest Scandinavian one.
Then, in the last couple of weeks, the character issue, a factor in several races around the country this year, took over Minnesota politics completely, in the person of Jon Grunseth, a conservative chosen as the G.O.P.'s nominee for governor.
 
Allegations Surface
 First, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis and St. Paul reported the charges of two women that Mr. Grunseth had swum naked with them in 1981, while they were still teen-agers, and that he had tried to yank down the swimsuit strap of one of them. He denied the charges, but another woman came forward to confirm the account in part.
Republicans saw their chances slipping away to elect Mr. Grunseth, and they worried that they would lose Mr. Stangeland's seat, suffer legislative setbacks and perhaps even see an upset of Senator Rudy Boschwitz, the party's powerhouse, who has also been hurt by President Bush's budget problems.
Mr. Boschwitz came bustling back to Minnesota, delivered a thoroughly confusing account of his position on the hiring discrimination bill and began trying to force Mr. Grunseth off the ticket. That brought him a lot of hostility from Republican conservatives and created still more confusion.
With Arne Carlson, a Republican moderate, planning a write-in campaign for governor, Mr. Grunseth called a news conference on Thursday to announce that he would pull out of the race. But he could not do it, and tore up his withdrawal statement.
"People have got to be thinking the Republican Party does not have its act together," said Bob Weinholzer, the party chairman, after hours of public indecision by Mr. Grunseth, "and they are probably right."
 
'Facing Disaster'
 "The Republican Party is just facing disaster," said former Gov. Elmer L. Anderson, a Republican.
Things couldn't get any worse, party loyalists said, but they did.
On Sunday, The Star Tribune reported the charges by Tamara Taylor that she had an intermittent affair with Mr. Grunseth from 1980 to 1989, during both of his marriages. On Sunday afternoon, the candidate abandoned his quest to unseat Gov. Rudy Perpich, who is seeking a fourth term, with the comment, "Man, it's just more than I can bear."
As of this morning, the Republicans were looking for a new candidate to head their ticket, with the election only eight days distant -- either Mr. Carlson, who is considerably more moderate than the party's executive committee, which will do the choosing, or one of two or three conservatives.
And as of this morning, Mr. Stangeland, who returned on Sunday at last after the lengthy budget and tax battle in Washington, was searching for some formula that would enable him, in the midst of all this chaos, to hold off the strong challenge of Collin C. Peterson. A Democratic former State Senator, Mr. Peterson has made no fewer than four previous attempts to oust him.
The seat has for many years been one of the few that is perennially closely contested, and the tightest contests have come in years, like this one, when there was no Presidential contest on the ballot. In 1982, Mr. Stangeland won with only 50.3 percent of the vote, and in 1986 Mr. Peterson, now 46, came within 121 votes of an upset.
 
A Close Race
 Recent polls show the two running neck and neck, but they give Mr. Stangeland less than 50 percent of the total with a large bloc of undecided voters. That is usually a bad omen for an incumbent who is as well known in his district as Mr. Stangeland is.
What was an apparent national swing to the Democrats, his own past vulnerability, the problem with the telephone calls and the beginnings of an economic downturn, Mr. Stangeland seems to analysts in Washington a prime candidate for defeat -- especially in the context of what former Vice President Walter F. Mondale calls "the loony-tune politics" that has hit Republicans in this state.
But even while he was stuck in Washington, Mr. Stangeland was mounting a strong defense, denouncing Mr. Peterson as an attack-and-spend liberal and driving home the point by voting against the final budget package that President Bush had endorsed.
If, as some local observers expect, the race is decided by television commercials, Mr. Stangeland may well have the edge, since he has outraced Mr. Peterson by more than 2 to 1.
In addition, Mr. Peterson has a rather racy reputation himself, which may help to blunt the character issue. He drives around in an old Porsche, leads a polka band and sometimes seems over-ambitious. That might count for little in most districts, but here in the bucolic countryside where Garrison Keillor planted his mystical Lake Wobegon, a man in too much of a hurry can raise a lot of eyebrows.
 
Late Sign of a Surge
 Still it is not easy to imagine how Mr. Peterson can miss this time, when Mr. Perpich, denounced for months as "Governor Goofy," has managed to get back into his race, and Mr. Boschwitz, seemingly untouchable a month ago, is under serious threat from Paul Wellston, an untested 46-year-old professor from Carleton College.
Pausing this weekend in his round of fish fries and ham dinners, Mr. Peterson said he sensed a surge in his effort in the last week or so.
"They don't ask me who I am anymore, and they don't ask what I stand for," he said. "They don't care about anything except whether you're 'in' or 'out.' I think it's going to be a little like Watergate and 1974, when all the Republicans in Minnesota, or most of them, just stayed at home.
"My only fear is I've run so often, people might think I'm the incumbent and vote against me."

HEADLINE: Experts Vary on Impact Of Plan to Trim Deficit

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Will the five-year deficit-reducing package of nearly $500 billion of spending cuts and tax increases voted by Congress on Sauturday help or hurt the economy?
 
Robert M. Solow, Nobel laureate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology:
The short-run impact of this package is almost certainly contractionary. It almost certainly adds to the 1989 impulse toward recession in the economy. It is very unlikely that the Fed will act fully and quickly enough to offset the contraction. I would not be able in five years to point to anything good from the agreement, the one exception being unless the package should induce the Fed and the world to allow substantially lower real interest rates. The longer-run impact over five to 10 years is probably favorable because then we could get more long-run growth, more investment in social infrastructure, more plant and equipment spending, more spending on research and development and a more skilled labor force.
 
Isabel V. Sawhill, senior fellow at the Urban Institute:
It will be good for the economy because it will untie Alan Greenspan's hands at the Fed to lower interest rates, and will have positive effects on the financial markets, and long-term rates hopefully will come down. The package buries "voodoo economics." Instead of assuming that we have to have low tax rates as a sure-fire tonic for the economy, it recognizes that big deficits are a greater threat than higher taxes. But it doesn't do much to control the growth in spending on the elderly, one of largest and fastest growting components of the budget. Social Security benefits weren't touched. Medicare benefits were only nicked. Medicare and Social Security represent 46 percent of domestic spending and slated to grow to 54 percent by the year 2000. There's also no effort to address the social deficit.
 
Sar Levitan, director of the Center for Social Policy at George Washington University:
For the short run, I don't think it will have much of an impact, particularly if the Fed follows it up with a mild reduction in interest rates. For the five-year period, it is more fiction than reality, because we can't project for five years from now, particularly since a recession may be looming on the horizon. To a large extent it is just a hope that we will reduce the budget deficit by $490 billion. Also, the projected deficits for the next five years will far exceed the $500 billion reduction that Congress has just voted. In case of recession or economic downturn, every 1 percent increase in unemployment will raise the deficit by another $40 billion. The average increase in each postwar recession was a 2 1/2 percent rise in unemployment. That would mean that if we have an average recession, the Fed budget deficit might actually increase by $100 billion. We don't know yet what will happen to the financial system in a recession.
 
John H. Makin, director of fiscal policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute:
The economy is weak and getting weaker. It is a modest package of deficit reduction. Everybody is celebrating because we're taking what we can get in these things. The previous largest was $25 billion after the 1987 stock market crash. This is of comparable scale. We are already so close to a recession that it's not worth arguing about. This is a very gentle tap further into a recession.
 
Alice M. Rivlin, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution:
The good things are: one, that it happened; two, that it's a five-year agreement, and three, that it is real. It is not smoke and mirrors. I also think it's about the right size for now. It's as big as they should have done, given the state of economy, though not enough for the long run. I don't think there will be any impetus for doing more next year, in what looks to be a fairly weak economy. Maybe in two or three years we will have courage to come back and say we have to do more. Forty billion dollars in the first year is in the small change of a $5 trillion economy.

HEADLINE: A Scramble for New Bailout Funds

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Bush Administration began scrambling today for ways to finance the bailout of the savings and loan industry in the wake of Congress's decision in its waning hours over the weekend not to supply any more money to the limping rescue effort.
A senior Treasury official, Deputy Secretary John E. Robson, said in an interview today that the department was considering use of an ambiguous provision in last year's bailout legislation that could permit the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the bailout, to borrow an additional $18.8 billion. But he said it would probably be days or longer before a decision would be made as the Administration evaluated the political and practical consequences of borrowing without Congressional approval. He added that even if some funds were borrowed, the pace of the bailout would be forced to slow considerably. 
 "We will now have to fashion a low-calorie or no-calorie diet plan that will enable us to keep something going," he said.
 
Warnings Were Issued
 The Resolution Trust has virtually run out of cash. In the last two weeks, Administration officials and regulators, who sought $40 billion for the next 12 months, had warned that a failure of Congress to appropriate new money would halt the rescue.
While those warnings now appear overdrawn, the most conservative estimates by regulators are that the delay will increase the bailout costs by at least $2 million a day for the next three months and $6 million a day after that as sales of institutions slow and the savings and loans remain in Government hands.
Some experts predict that the cost of the financing delay could ultimately total more than $2 billion a quarter if the costs of delaying the seizure and sale of hundreds of institutions still under private management were included.
"The delay can now easily drag to six months and there is nothing good about it," said Bert Ely, an industry consultant, who predicted that it would now cost taxpayers $2 billion to $2.5 billion a quarter in extra financing because of the fund delay. "Coming into a recession, this is probably the worst time to be slowing down."
 
Move in House Blocked
 The effort to get more financing had been making headway in Congress, but just before the recess on Sunday morning a last-ditch effort by the House banking chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez, to authorize $10 billion in new financing until February was blocked by the second-ranking Democrat on the banking committee, Frank Annunzio of Illinois.
Mr. Annunzio, who has been critical of how the Administration has conducted the bailout, is facing a fierce race to retain his Chicago seat, in large part because of his close ties to the savings and loan industry. After his objection, the Senate went on to approve the interim financing measure by voice vote, but by then it was a dead issue in the House.
The tug-of-war between the Treasury Department and lawmakers is the most visible sign yet of how politically unpalatable the costly savings and loan bailout has become. While Democrats and Republicans have recognized that the financing is needed to keep the costs from increasing further, neither the Administration nor Congress wanted to be seen as taking the lead on authorizing new funds.
"Congress ran away from the problem," Mr. Robson said, continuing the political dispute between the Administration and lawmakers that developed after Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady refused repeated invitations to appear this month before Congress to justify the $40 billion request. "It doesn't help a bit to have Congress put a banana peel on the sidewalk right when we're rolling at a good pace."
Aides to Mr. Brady said he declined to testify because he saw it as little more than an attempt to haul him before the cameras and use him for political fodder just before the elections. His decision was harshly criticized by both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill who maintained that he had a responsibility to testify and who used his refusal as a basis to oppose further appropriations.
Mr. Gonzalez continued today to blame the Administration, saying in a statement today, "The objections raised Saturday night to the consideration of additional funding are reflective of widespread concern about the cost of the savings and loan cleanup, the manner in which the program is being administered and the slow pace of resolutions and asset sales."
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, said he expected the Administration to approve borrowing the $18.8 billion in financing quickly. "Assuming that it is available, we will be able to push forward, but it will cost extra money no matter what happens," he said, noting that the uncertainty over the agency's budget had already forced regulators to slow the pace of the rescue effort significantly in recent weeks.
But Mr. Robson said the Administration and the Resolution Trust's oversight board would not act hastily in interpreting the law to permit an additional $18.8 billion in borrowing.
"We have to decide whether it is appropriate to proceed in the face of some ambiguity and whether it is just the right thing to do," he said.
 
An Ambiguous Provision
 Because of what even its authors now consider an error in last year's bailout legislation, an ambiguous provision may permit Resolution Trust to exceed the cap limiting its borrowing authority and borrow up to an additional $18.8 billion, according to the General Accounting Office and some lawmakers, including Mr. Gonzalez. Before this week, Resolution Trust had said it believed the ambiguity would not permit such borrowings. The Treasury Department has not formally issued its interpretation of the provision.
William H. Roelle, director of the Resolutions and Operations Division of Resolution Trust, said the budget crunch would not affect the agency's ability to dispose of 65 savings associations with assets of less than $500 million each, but that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, to sell or close larger institutions whose plight is more costly to resolve.
"This program is like a supertanker," Mr. Roelle said. "Once you slow it down, it takes a lot to start up again."

 BODY:
It is not easy to run against the Government you are running. It is not easy to carve up Democrats as "big taxers" when you've been huddling with the Democrats in Washington to raise taxes.
It is not easy to say you need more Republicans in Congress to help push your agenda when the White House-approved budget deal was passed mostly with Democratic votes. 
 But, as George Bush knows, consistency is the hobgoblin of politics. With a bipartisan budget agreement finally in place, President Bush came to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame today and declared that it was High Noon for Democrats.
 
'Class Warfare Garbage'
 With a sneer in his voice and the sort of Clint Eastwood-style "red meat lines" that have not been heard since the 1988 campaign, Mr. Bush began the scalding partisan attack on the "liberal" Democrats in Congress that he will be using till Election Day. He accused them of everything from stalling the economy and the budget agreement for partisan gain, to spreading "class warfare garbage," to turning their backs on police officers and the American dream, to pushing through "pork barrel bonanzas" like a Lawrence Welk tourist attraction in North Dakota.
Some Bush advisers feared that it would smack of cynicism to take a bitter and brutal tone toward the Democrats as the spend-and-tax party so soon after working with them on a budget deal that included new taxes, and that the tactic would backfire.
Some also wondered if it was dubious imagery to begin his cross-country message that the Republicans are the party of the working class by starting the day with a $25,000-per-couple fund-raising event for Senator Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate for governor of California, in San Francisco.
But Mr. Bush shrugged off questions today about his sagging popularity and about whether he has become a liability to Republican candidates.
The President grinned gamely as Bill Price, the Oklahoma candidate for governor for whom he was campaigning, introduced him with what would be considered faint praise in Republican circles. "George Bush on his worst day is a whole lot better than Michael Dukakis on his best day," Mr. Price told the crowd at the cowboy museum, adding supportively to the man who was supposed to be giving him a boost, "Your friends in Oklahoma are standing by you through thick and thin."
 
The Insider Is Outside
 Although the President's bipartisan budget deal-making has given him the image of the quintessential "inside-the-Beltway" President, Mr. Bush attempted to play the outsider. He invoked Harry S. Truman's name, complained about "inside-the-Beltway bickering" and commented at every chance: "God I'm glad to be out of Washington. I'm thrilled to be out of Washington."
In an all-out bid to give the wavering Republicans back their national voice, as he stumps around the country in the last eight days before mid-term elections, Mr. Bush lacerated liberals, who he said are "still peddling that tired old saw about Republicans and the rich."
"Well, you and I both know that that is hogwash, and we're not going to let them get away with that anymore," Mr. Bush said. "I'm taking this message all across the country: We are for the working people in this country."
Saying the various proposals to reduce the deficit were "the good, the bad and the ugly," Mr. Bush accused the Democrats of pushing him into tax increases -- even though the President himself issued the first explicit statement conceding that he would have to break his "no new taxes" pledge.
 
'We Had to Pay a Ransom'
 "To get an agreement, we had to pay a ransom to get the $350 billion in spending cuts," the President said. "And the American people have had to pay a price for divided government."
He tried to tar the Democrats, who believe they have regained their national voice as champions of the middle class and poor, as "big spenders" who tried to pack the budget agreement with pork.
"At the same time, this President and these Republican members were doing our level-best to curtail spending, Congress voted to spend a half a million dollars to create a Lawrence Welk tourist attraction," Mr. Bush said. "And we all like Lawrence Welk, 'dah-dee-dah,' you know how he is. But I cite this as a symptom of the problem." Mr. Bush was referring to Congress's approval last week of a $500,000 grant for Strasburg, N.D., to build a German-Russian museum at the farm where the famous band leader was born.
By not turning in a budget in April, the President said, the Democratic-controlled Congress put the country "on the brink of an economic downturn."
"The Democrats choked the throttle, pulled the throttle back of a slowing economy, while they hunted for every last morsel of partisan advantage," he said. "All in the name of politics and of higher taxes. And we're not going to let them get away with it."
 
'A House of Lords'
 He said that the Democrats in Congress had become "America's biggest and most entrenched special interest."
"The Democratic Congress is a confusion of committees and turf-conscious chaos," he said. "The House intended to be closest to the people has become a House of Lords."
Speaking with reporters at the San Francisco airport this morning, Mr. Bush was asked why Americans should not feel betrayed that he had caved in on raising taxes.
"Because I think people know that this Congress is controlled by the taxers, by the liberal Democrats," he said. "And they also know that we needed to try to get something done, and they also know that a President is elected to compromise at times, only rarely. But he's also elected to govern. American people are fair. They know I'm against taxes."
Mr. Bush also defended his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and budget chief, Richard G. Darman, against criticism that they have rent the party and isolated the President.
"They are strong, and they are able," Mr. Bush said. "And any time you've got to do some heavy lifting on behalf of the President, you're bound to get caught up in a little crossfire."

U.N. COUNCIL HOLDS THE IRAQIS LIABLE ON KUWAIT DAMAGE

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council overwhelmingly approved a resolution today laying the groundwork for a seizure of impounded Iraqi assets.
The latest resolution, intended to increase pressure on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, warned that if the Iraqis continued to disregard Council demands, the world organization would take "further measures under the Charter." This could include the use of military force, but this was not explicitly mentioned. [Text, page A12.] 
 The new resolution declares Iraq responsible for all damage and personal injuries resulting from its occupation of Kuwait and asks nations to prepare claims for financial compensation and submit evidence of human rights violations by Iraqi forces there.
 
Yemen and Cuba Abstain
 The final vote showed 13 members in favor, while Yemen, the Council's only Arab member, and Cuba abstained. The vote was postponed from last Saturday while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union sent a high-level envoy on another mission to Baghdad.
By voting for the resolution, the Soviet Union indicated that the trip to Baghdad by Mr. Gorbachev's envoy, Yevgeny M. Primakov, did not produce the kind of breakthrough that could forestall further Council action. Mr. Primakov said in answer to a question upon leaving Baghdad that his trip had been disappointing.
But Mr. Gorbachev in Paris still held out the possibility that President Saddam Hussein might yield to the United Nations demands. He said he had received fresh information from Mr. Primakov suggesting that "Iraq's leadership might at last heed the voice of the United Nations."
 
New U.S. Warnings
 While Mr. Gorbachev continued to urge a diplomatic solution, primarily through Arab nations, the Bush Administration stepped up its warnings that military power might be used to force Iraq out of Kuwait if nothing else works.
In a speech in Los Angeles, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d explicitly said that the use of military power was one option to pursue in getting Iraq to leave Kuwait. "We will not rule out a possible use of force if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait," Mr. Baker said.
At the United Nations Arab diplomats said President Hussein appears to be seriously worried by the danger of an American-led attack on his forces in Kuwait and Iraq.
They said Mr. Hussein sent a message over the weekend to Mr. Gorbachev and President Francois Mitterrand of France in advance of their talks in Paris today, offering to release all the foreign hostages held by Iraq if those two leaders committed themselves to a political solution.
But the Gorbachev-Mitterrand meeting ended without such a joint statement. Yemen's Foreign Minister, Abdel-Karim al-Iryani, said in Sana, his nation's capital, today that he had learned of this Iraqi offer in a phone conversation with Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz.
The resolution approved by the Security Council today also requires Iraq to cease looting and hostage-taking in Kuwait and resupply the foreign embassies still holding out there. Only the United States and Britain have operating embassies in Kuwait. France ordered its remaining diplomats home today.
The resolution asked the Secretary General of the United Nations to try once more to find a peaceful way out of the crisis. But it warned that if Baghdad continues to reject its demands, the Council will take further unspecified "measures under the Charter" to enforce them.
 
Options Available to U.N.
 These could include tightening the trade embargo it has imposed, although the Council is reluctant to cut telecommunications links or break off diplomatic relations, the only remaining nonmilitary steps provided for by the Charter.
Thomas R. Pickering, the United States representative to the United Nations, hinted that the Council might soon consider paying compensation to victims of Iraq's aggression out of the country's assets frozen overseas.
But the Council might also threaten to oust Iraq from Kuwait by force, as the Charter allows if it decides that economic sanctions are not effective.
The five big powers with permanent Council seats sought to reinforce this implicit threat of force today by convening the Security Council's military advisory body at the highest level in United Nations history.
For the first time the United States sent a three-star general from Washington to represent the Joint Chiefs of Staff at a meeting of the Security Council's Military Staff Committee, called to review the situation in the Persian Gulf and the efforts there to enforce the trade embargo against Iraq.
 
Soviet and Chinese Generals
 Lieut. Gen. Michael Carns, Director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, was joined by Col. Gen. Bronislav A. Omelichev, First Deputy Chief of the Soviet General Staff, who came from Moscow for the talks and by Vice Adm. Alain Coatanea, a senior French naval officer from Paris.
China was represented by Maj. Gen. Du Guanyi, the head of its delegation to the committee, and Britain by Maj. Gen. Edwin H. A. Beckett, head of the British Defense Staff in Washington.
Several delegates addressed the Council in terms that suggested that a decision to use force might not be far away.
Mr. Pickering, after emphasizing that every government has a duty to protect its citizens held hostage by Iraq, said, "The United States will do that which is necessary to meet its obligations for its own citizens."
Canada's representative, Yves Fortier, said the Council "must not shy away" from enforcing its decisions. And Malaysia's representative, Ismail Razali, said, "The Council's ability to undertake futher enforcement measures should not be doubted."
Iraq's representative, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, made an hourlong speech in which he gave a preview of some of the difficulties the Council may face later this week by asking why it punished Iraq for occupying Kuwait but not Israel for occupying East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
California Banks: Bad Times Near?

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
REAL estate values in California, a bastion of strength compared with New England and other parts of the East Coast, are deteriorating rapidly and may become the next problem for the nation's banking industry, analysts say.
While California bankers and economists have predicted a mild downturn, other analysts have recently begun predicting more severe problems. When California's weakness hurts local banks and filters through to other sectors of the economy, as occurred in New England, the chances of a severe national recession are greatly increased, they said. 
 David Shulman, a real estate analyst at Salomon Brothers, told clients yesterday that the slowdown in home sales in California, declines in home prices there and high vacancy rates for commercial property all point to a market that is weaker than he expected a few months ago. He warned that a broad-based national decline in real estate prices would be steeper than he expected because of higher oil prices and an economy that is in recession.
"There is a one-in-three chance that the problems in California will be as bad as Texas," said George Salem, a banking analyst at Prudential Bache Securities. In Texas, the collapse of real estate after the decline in oil prices in the 1980's eventually led to the failure or acquisition of 9 of the state's 10 largest banking companies.
Mr. Salem did not predict the imminent collapse of California's four largest banks, but he said they face difficult times. With a third or more of their loans backed by real estate, a 25 percent decline in real estate prices is sure to cause defaults by developers who cannot sell new buildings and mustdefault on loans. He recommends that investors sell Wells Fargo, Security Pacific and First Interstate, and he rates BankAmerica a "hold."
Wells Fargo & Company, whose stock was as high as $87.375 a share in October 1989, fell $2.75 yesterday to $45.125; Security Pacific dropped 87.5 cents, to $17.75, from $50 in the same period, and First Interstate fell yesterday by $1, to $17.125, from $64.25 in October. The BankAmerica Corporation dropped 25 cents yesterday, to $18.50, and is down from a peak of $36.25.
While Wall Street analysts like Mr. Salem and Thomas Hanley at Salomon Brothers are predicting big problems for California banks, local bankers seem more confident that California is too healthy for debacles like those in Texas or New England.
At the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, economists said last week that the "most recent data provide no indication that the quality of either commercial or real estate loans has begun to deteriorate." In August, another article published by the San Francisco Fed concluded that California's "slowdown" was merely a return to normalcy after the boom years of 1988 and 1989. The Fed's economists said that with the slowdown in construction activity, there would not be the severe overbuilding that hurt New England.
Other analysts are not so sanguine. Mr. Salem noted that in downtown Los Angeles, the supply of office space would rise at least 30 percent by the end of next year, a glut that is causing developersto offer tenants two years of free rent on a 10-year lease. The glut is also greatly reducing the value of new and existing office buildings.
According to Mr. Salem, who recently published a 46-page study of the California real estate market, problems are looming for single-family mortgage loans, which bankers have long regarded as safe. He does not expect significant losses on such loans for banks by 1991, but warned that losses are possible in subsequent years, depending on how far home prices drop and how many homeowners lose their jobs.
Home prices in California have fallen much more than the decline of a few percentage points over the past year reported by the California Association of Realtors, Mr. Salem said. Based on interviews and a study of newspaper advertisements, he said existing home prices have already fallen by 10 to 20 percent from their peaks in mid-1989. By the end of next year, home prices might be down 25 percent or more from their peaks, he added.
The risk of losses for banks is greatest on loans made since the end of 1987, when real estate values and loan amounts were near their peaks. At the Bank of America, two-thirds of home mortgages were issued since the beginning of 1988, leading Mr. Salem to conclude that there is a danger that as economic weakness lingers, bankers will discover risk in their newer mortgages, while older mortgages are safer.
Even if defaults on owner-occupied, single-family homes are rare, Mr. Schulman said the economy would suffer if families in California and elsewhere were unable or unwilling to sell their existing houses because prices had fallen. He said many families had come to rely on profits from home sales to pay for the purchases of major appliances and automobiles, as well as for the down payment for a new, larger home.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Move Above $34 a Barrel

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices increased to more than $34 a barrel in light trading on the futures market yesterday amid concerns that a Soviet peace effort in the Persian Gulf had failed.
"It was perhaps one of the last-ditch efforts to get a peaceful resolution," said Christian Gohler, a vice president with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. "As a result, the market moved higher." 
 A barrel of crude for December delivery rose $1.67, to $34.68, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for later months also settled higher.
Traders said the session was one of the quietest they could remember since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
Although there was no strong news to move the market, prices opened higher and held their ground on reports of the unsuccessful Soviet efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
"There was a lot of speculation over the weekend that there could be some progress made," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "Whether it's true or not, people are saying this may be the last chance before some military action is necessary. The thinking is, If the Soviets can't get Iraq to change, who can?"
The Soviet Union and Iraq once had close ties, but the Soviets still lined up with the rest of the global community in condemning Iraq for its attack on Kuwait.
Soviet Middle East envoy Yevgeny M. Primakov met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Sunday. After those talks, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said he saw no reason for optimism in the gulf.
Some traders stayed on the sidelines Monday as they waited to see an interview with Mr. Hussein that Cable News Network was to air Monday evening. Oil prices hit their lows for the day on the Merc when players learned from an excerpt of the interview that the Iraqi leader was apparently refusing to rule out the idea of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.
"He was saying peace was still possible," said Ed Kevelson, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Crude's increase early in the day was mirrored in the futures prices for refined petroleum products. Home heating oil settled 3.11 cents higher at 91.36 cents a gallon for November delivery. Contracts for later months all closed higher.
Unleaded gasoline settled up .96 cent at 92.43 cents per gallon for November, with other delivery months trading higher.
Natural gas futures were off for the day, with the December contract falling 1.4 cents, to $2.434 per 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Popularizing Accounting For Students

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
IN this time of recession concerns, the accounting profession, like many others, is undergoing cutbacks in pay or staffing.
Yet accounting might be one of the best careers for the future. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, reporting on occupations with the largest growth prospects, says that the army of 963,000 accountants and auditors it estimated in 1988 needs to increase by 22 percent, to 1,174,000, by the year 2000 to meet growing needs from both accounting firms and businesses. 
 Last spring, graduates with accounting majors received job offers at salaries averaging $26,496, up 5 percent from the previous year, according to the College Placement Council.
 Too few college students, however, major in accounting and too few with graduate degrees are entering the profession, possibly because it is not considered glamorous. Also, many who earn master of business administration degrees with an accounting specialty tend to take jobs with businesses. To insure a better supply of talent, the half-dozen big accounting firms have been providing money for scholarships, professors and programs.
Dr. Ronald J. Patten cited this situation in a recent interview, saying part of his job is "making accounting popular" to attract more young people. As dean of the College of Commerce at De Paul University in Chicago, he heads one of the largest undergraduate business schools and the nation's fourth-largest graduate business program. There are 2,646 students in the daytime undergraduate business program and 1,174 in the evening program, plus 2,995 students in graduate programs working for master of business administration degrees or master of science degrees in accounting.
"The fact that fewer students major in accounting is a national phenomenon," he said. He added that De Paul was not experiencing it so much, however, " because our enrollment of accounting majors is down less than 1 percent in recent years." At the graduate level he called accounting enrollment at least "stable."
Many students, he said, had a perception that accounting courses could be "boring." To combat that, Dr. Patten said, "we're using the interactive mode -- case studies to supplement analytical techniques they must learn."
He added: "Students defend their judgments after reading case histories, and this results in more interaction with classmates and the professor. That's our prime tool."
For example, he explained, one case study he wrote involved a large Trinidad company that makes batteries in Barbados. To help increase sales, an incentive system was begun for salesmen.
In the United States, Dr. Patten said, a battery maker is such a large company that production workers do not come into contact with salesmen. But on a small island they did, and the incentive system created so much animosity it had to be revised. Salesmen continue to be rewarded for increased sales, while production workers are granted extra money based on decreasing warranty claims that indicate better-quality production.
De Paul uses a variety of cases, especially those published by the University of Virginia's business school, the Harvard business school and the business school of the University of Western Ontario, in London.
Like other deans, Dr. Patten faces another problem -- the weakness of students in communications. "It's a national problem," he said. To put corporate strategy into effect, managers must have skills in writing, speaking, reading and even listening to get the support of workers, he added. And so, after almost a year and a half in the De Paul post, he talks of redesigning the undergraduate curriculum to "integrate communications" into many required courses.
For ethics, the school uses video tapes provided by Arthur Andersen & Company, the big accounting firm. As for international accounting, Dr. Patten said textbooks had improved with the addition of more international case material.
The year 2000 presents a special worry for the profession. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, its ruling body, has decreed that new members at that time must meet a requirement of 150 hours of education. That means an undergraduate program of 120 hours, including core liberal arts courses, and 30 hours beyond, mostly in accounting.
To meet this, Dr. Patten said, "We have a program with some large accounting firms who offer employment to liberal arts graduates." He explained that individuals were hired by such a firm and spent their first salaried summer studying accounting full-time. Then they work full-time for the firm, taking additional courses at night, followed by a second full-time summer of study, and a fall term working and studying. The result: a master of science degree in accounting. "We graduate about 15 a year in this program and hope to double it to 30," he said.
Looking back at his education -- earning a master's degree in accounting followed by a doctorate -- Dr. Patten said a useful course for an accountant-to-be would include history.
"I continue to feel that history is important," he said. "A lot of what happens in the world has taken place before.
"We have an economic history course, not required. I would like to see it required, along with business and financial history."
Such courses have also been making a comeback at the business schools of New York University and Cornell University.

HEADLINE: Fiber-Optic Network Is Urged at Conference

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Scientists, business executives and academic researchers meeting here today said the key to restoring United States competitiveness is to drop regulatory barriers to building a fiber-optic network to deliver electronic information to the nation's homes. The regulated Bell operating companies have argued that they need to be freed to provide electronic information services, including television, to justify the investment in building such a network.
The meeting came just two days after Congress failed to pass a bill that would have provided a half-billion dollars over three years for research and development to build a high-speed computer network to link the nation's supercomputer centers. 
 A computer network that would carry video, voice and data at speeds up to a thousand times faster than existing networks has been backed by both Congressional Democrats and the Bush Administration. But a bill introduced by Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, failed to pass over the weekend.
 
Growing Consensus Seen
 Speakers here at a three-day meeting held to discuss whether the Government should play a role in fostering high-technology development said there is a growing consensus in the country that a fiber-optic network to carry voice and data for business and video for home entertainment would serve as a catalyst for American companies and revitalize the American microelectronics industry.
"The fiber-optic network should be looked at as a prolific tree and the fruit will be the new businesses it creates," said Dr. George A. Keyworth, a physicist who was science adviser to President Reagan and is now director of research at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis. The institute, a conservative policy center, sponsored the three-day symposium.
Deregulation of the regional Bell operating companies that would permit local phone companies to sell information services and transmit video to the nation's home has been opposed by the cable industry and by newspapers.
 
Growing Impatience Cited
 But Dr. Keyworth said that there is a growing impatience in the country to move ahead with new technologies.
A number of researchers who spoke here argued that the revamping of the nation's communications infrastructure would yield unexpected benefits and new economic productivity.
"Whenever you make access to a resource like this, a number of new things that were unexpected will happen," said Dr. Carver Mead, a California Institute of Technology scientist who developed techniques that have made the rapid design of the most advanced semiconductors possible.
 
Warning on Japanese Project
 The researchers also warned that Japan is well under way in a project to spend as much as $250 billion on developing their own fiber optic network before the turn of the century. Dr. Keyworth said that on a recent visit to Japan he had been told that that nation expects to receive fully one-third of its gross national product from services carried by the fiber-optic network by the year 2015.
The participants at the conference did not agree on what kind of leadership the Government should provide in creating a public fiber-optic computer network. Richard J. Elkus, chief executive of the Prometrix Corporation, said that the Bush Administration needed to show more leadership in guiding the country toward renewed economic competiveness. Mr. Elkus said the nation was rapidly losing its manufacturing base to Japanese competitors.
"We are competing against a nation, Japan, that defines short-term as a year and long-term as forever," he said.
George Gilder, an author and economist at the Hudson Institute, said that if the Government's role was minimized, entrepreneurial companies would be freed to compete effectively against the Japanese.
Some of those present said that economic competition along national lines was increasingly less relevant. Peter J. Sprague, chairman of National Semiconductor Corporation, said that the definition of what an American corporation is has rapidly been blurring. "We are using Russian engineers living in Israel to design chips that are made in America and then assembled in Asia," he said.
